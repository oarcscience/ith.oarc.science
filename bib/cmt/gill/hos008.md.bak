### [Hosea Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#001.md)

[Hosea](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">hos 8:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO HOSEA 8

This chapter treats of the sins and punishment of Israel for them, as
the preceding; it is threatened and proclaimed that an enemy should come
swiftly against them, because of their transgression of the covenant and
law of God, [Hos 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#001.md); their hypocrisy
is exposed, [Hos 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#002.md); they are charged
with the rejection of that which is good, and therefore should be
pursued by the enemy, [Hos 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#003.md); with
setting up kings and princes without consulting the Lord, [Hos
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#004.md); and with making of idols,
particularly the golden calves, which would be of no use to them,
disappoint them, and at last be broke to pieces, [Hos
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#004.md); their seeking to their neighbours
for help, and entering into alliances with them, are represented as vain
and fruitless, and issuing in their ruin and destruction, [Hos
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#007.md); their sins of multiplying altars,
contrary to the law of God, and in contempt of it, and offering
sacrifices to the Lord, are observed; and they with a visitation from
him, [Hos 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#011.md); and the chapter is
concluded with some notice and Judah, the one building temples, and
multiplying fenced cities, which should be by fire, [Hos
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#014.md).

[Hosea 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 8:1</span></span>

Set the trumpet to thy mouth,.... Or, "the trumpet to the roof of thy
mouth" (t); a concise expression denoting haste, and the vehemence of
the passions speaking; they are either the words of the Lord to the
prophet, as the Targum,

"O prophet, cry with thy throat as with a trumpet, saying;''

Aben Ezra take them to be the words of the Lord the prophet, and the
sense agrees with [Isa 58:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#001.md). The
prophet is here considered as a watchman, and is called upon to blow his
trumpet; either to call the people together, "as an eagle to the house
of the Lord" (u), as the next clause may be connected with this; that
is, to come as swiftly to the house of the Lord, and hear what he had to
say to them, and to supplicate the Lord for mercy in a time of distress:
or to give the people notice of the approach of the enemy, and tell them
that

he shall come as an eagle against the house of the Lord; "flying as an
eagle over" (w) or "against the house of the Lord": or they are the
words of the Lord, or of the prophet, to the enemy, to blow his trumpet,
and sound the alarm of war, and call his army together, and bid them fly
like an eagle, with that swiftness and fierceness as that creature does
to its prey, against the house of the Lord; meaning not the temple at
Jerusalem, but the nation of Israel, formerly called the house and
family of God, and still pretended to be so. There may be some allusion
to Bethel, which signifies the house of God, where they practised their
idolatry. This is to be understood, not of Nebuchadnezzar, sometimes
compared to an eagle, [Eze 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#003.md); for
not the destruction of the city and temple of Jerusalem is here meant;
nor of the Romans, as Lyra seems to understand it, the eagle being the
ensign of the Romans; but of Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, compared to
this creature for his swiftness in coming, his strength, fierceness, and
cruelty; this creature being swift in flight, and a bird of prey. So the
Targum interprets it of a king and his army,

"behold, as an eagle flieth, so shall a king with his army come up and
encamp against the house of the sanctuary of the Lord.''

Some reference seems to be had to [Deu
28:49](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#049.md);

because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my
law; the law that was given to Israel by Moses at the appointment of
God, to which they assented, and promised to observes: and so it had the
form of a covenant to them: the bounds of this law and covenant they
transgressed, and dealt perfidiously with, and prevaricated in, and
wilfully broke all its commands, by their idolatry, murder, adultery,
theft, and other sins.

[Hosea 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 8:2</span></span>

Israel shall cry unto me, my God, we know thee. In their distress they
shall cry to the Lord to help them, and have mercy on them, as they used
to do when in trouble, [Isa 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#016.md);
when the eagle is come upon them, and just ready to devour them; when
Samaria is besieged with file Assyrian army, their king taken prisoner,
and they just ready to fall into the hands of the enemy, then they shall
cry to God, though in a hypocritical manner; own him to be the true God,
and claim their interest in him, and pretend knowledge of him, and
acquaintance with him; though they have not served and worshipped him,
but idols, and that for hundreds of years; like others who profess to
know God, but in works deny him, [Tit
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#016.md). Israel is the last word in the
verse, and occasions different versions: "they shall cry unto me"; these
transgressors of the covenant and the law, these hypocrites, shall pray
to God in trouble, saying, "my God, we Israel", or Israelites, "know
thee"; or, "we know thee who are Israel" (x); and to this sense is the
Targum,

"in every time that distress comes upon them, they pray before me, and
say, now we know that we have no God besides thee; redeem us, for we are
thy people Israel;''

why may they not be rendered thus, "they shall cry unto me; my God, we
know thee, Israel" shall say? Castalio renders them to this sense, "my
God", say they; but "we know thee, Israel"; we, the three Persons in the
Trinity, Father, Son, and Spirit, we know thy hypocrisy and wickedness,
that it is only outwardly and hypocritically, and not sincerely, that
thou criest unto and callest upon God.

\(x\) "ad me clamant, Deus mi, novimus te nos Israel", De Dieu;
"clamabunt ad me, O Deus meus, nos Israelitae cognoscimus te", Tigurine
version, so Tarnovius; "mihi vocant, Deus mi, cognovimus, vel agnoscimus
te Israel", vel "nos lsrael, seu Israelitae", Schmidt.

[Hosea 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 8:3</span></span>

Israel hath cast off the thing that is good,.... Or "rejected him that
is good" (y); that is, God, as Kimchi observes; for there is none good
but him, [Mat 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#017.md); he is the "summum
bonum", "the chiefest good" to men, and is essentially, originally, and
infinitely good in himself, and the fountain of all goodness to his
creatures; and yet Israel has rejected him with detestation and
contempt, as the word (z) signifies, though they pretended to know him,
which shows their hypocrisy; and therefore it is no wonder that their
prayers were rejected by him: or they rejected the good word of God, the
law, or doctrine contained in it, and the good worship, service, and
fear of God, and indeed everything that was good, just, and right.
Cocceius renders it, "the good One", or he that is God, the good God,
"hath cast off Israel". This reading of the words Drusius also mentions,
and seems to like best, and as agreeing with what follows; so Rivet; but
the position of the words in the Hebrew text, and the accents, do not
favour it;

the enemy shall pursue him; who is before compared to an eagle, which
flies swiftly, and pursues its prey with eagerness and fierceness:
Shalmaneser is meant, who should invade the land, come up to Samaria,
besiege and take it; nothing should stop him, nor should Israel escape
from him, since they had cast off the Lord, and everything that was
good. The Targum is,

"the house of Israel have erred from my worship, for the sake of which I
brought good things upon them; henceforward the enemy shall pursue
them.''

[Hosea 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 8:4</span></span>

They have set up kings, but not by me,.... Not by his authority, order,
and command; not by asking advice of him, or his leave, but of
themselves, and of their own, accord: this refers to the case of
Jeroboam their first king, after their separation from the house of
David, and from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin; for though his
becoming king of Israel was according to the secret will of God, and by
his overruling providence; yet it was done without his express orders,
and without asking counsel of him, or his consent, and of their own
heads; and many of his successors were conspirators, and set up
themselves with the consent of the people, to the dethroning of others,
and upon the slaughter of them, as Shallum, Menahem, Pekah, and Hoshea:
the people of Israel had no right to choose a king for themselves; the
right was alone in the Lord; it was he that chose, appointed, and
constituted their kings, [Deu 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#015.md);
thus Saul, David, and Solomon, were chose and appointed by him, [Sa1
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#024.md); it was not the person of
Jeroboam chosen God disliked; but their taking it upon them to choose
and set him up without his leave;

they have made princes, and knew it not; that is, they set up
subordinate governors, judges, civil magistrates, elders of the people,
over them, without his approbation, and such as were very disagreeable
to him; otherwise he knew what was done by them, as being the omniscient
God, but he did not approve of what they did. Some observe, that in the
word used, is put for and should be rendered, "they have removed", so
Jarchi and Japhet; that is, they have set up kings, and they have
removed them; they have took it upon them to make and pose kings at
pleasure, without seeking the Lord about it, when this is his
prerogative, who is King of kings, and Lord of lords, [Dan
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#021.md); which sense makes a strong and
beautiful antithesis;

of their silver and their gold have they made their idols; some of their
idols were made of silver, others of gold; particularly the calves at
Dan and Bethel, which are called the golden calves, because made of
gold; as was the calf in the wilderness, [Kg1
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#028.md); see [Isa
46:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#006.md);

that they may be cut off: which denotes not the end, intentions, and
design of making these idols of silver and gold, but the event thereof;
namely, either the destruction of the idols themselves, which, for the
sake of the silver and gold they were made of; were cut in pieces by a
foreign enemy; or the gold and silver were cut off from the people,
their riches and wealth were wasted by such means; or rather the people
were cut off, everyone of them, because of their worship of them, or
this would be the case.

[Hosea 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 8:5</span></span>

Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off,.... Or, is the cause of thy
being cast off by the Lord, and of being cast out of thine own land, and
carried captive into another; the past tense is used for the future, as
is common in prophetic writings, to denote the certainty of the thing:
or "thy calf hath left thee" (a); in the lurch; it cannot help thee; it
is gone off, and forsaken thee; it has "removed" itself from thee,
according to the sense of the word in [Lam
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#017.md); as Kimchi and Ben Melech
observe; or is removed far from thee, being carried captive itself into
Assyria; for, when the king of Assyria took Samaria, he seized on the
golden calf for the sake of the gold, and took it away; see [Hos
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#005.md); or "he hath removed thy calf"
(b); that is, the enemy, taking it away when he took the city; or God
has rejected it with the utmost contempt and abhorrence: the calf is
here, and in the following verse, called the calf of Samaria, because
this was the metropolis of the ten tribes, in which the calf was
worshipped, and because it was worshipped by the Samaritans; and it may
be, when Samaria became the chief city, the calf at Bethel might be
removed thither, or another set up in that city:

mine anger is kindled against them: the calves at Dan and Bethel, the
singular before being put for the plural; or against the if of Samaria,
and Samaria itself; or the inhabitants of it, because of the worship of
the calf, which was highly provoking to God, it being a robbing him of
his glory, and giving it to graven images:

how long will it be ere they attain to innocency? or "purity" (c); of
worship, life, and conversation: the words may be rendered thus, "how
long?" (d) for there is a large stop there; and this may be a question
of the prophet's, asking how long the wrath of God would burn against
the people, what; would be the duration of it, and when it would end? to
which an answer is returned, as the words may be translated, "they
cannot bear purity" (e); of doctrine, of worship of heart, and life;
when they can, mine anger will cease burning: or, as the Targum,

"as long as they cannot purify themselves,''

or be purified; so long as they continue in their sins, in their
superstition and idolatry, and other impieties, and are not purged from
them.

[Hosea 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 8:6</span></span>

For from Israel was it also,.... That is, the calf was from Israel; it
was an invention of theirs, as some say; they did not borrow it from
their neighbours, as they did other idols, but it was their own
contrivance: but this tines not seem to be fact; for the calf, the
making of it indeed, was of themselves, but the worship of it they
borrowed from the Egyptians; with this difference, the Egyptians
worshipped a living cow or ox, these the golden image of a calf: but
rather the sense is, that this calf was made by the advice of Israel, by
the advice of Jeroboam their king, and of their princes, they assenting
to it, so Aben Ezra; or the gold and silver of which it was made was
exacted on them, and collected from them, as the Targum and Jarchi; or
workmen were employed by them to make it; and so it was of them also, as
any other work that was done by their advice and direction, and at their
expense; and therefore could never have any divinity in it, any more
than other things they did; though this is commonly interpreted as
having respect to the making of the golden calf by Aaron, that this also
was of Israel as well as that:

the workman made it; therefore it is not God; a strong and invincible
reason this; for, since the call was the work of an artificer, of the
goldsmith or founder, it could not be God; there could not be deity in
it; for a creature cannot make a God, or give that which itself has not;
if the workman was not God, but a creature, if deity was not in him, he
could never give it to a golden image, a lifeless statue fashioned by
him: this, one would think, should have been a clear, plain, striking,
and convincing argument to them, that their calf was, as the Targum has
it,

"a deity in which there was no profit:''

but the calf of Samaria shall be broken to pieces; or "for (f) the calf
of Samaria", &c. being another reason to prove it could not be God; if
the former would not convince them, this surely would, when they should
see it broke to pieces by the enemy, from whom it could not save itself;
and therefore could not be a god that could be of any service to them,
or save them. The Vulgate Latin version renders it, "for the calf of
Samaria shall become spiders webs": and Jerom says he learned it of a
Jew that the word so signifies; but his Jew imposed upon him: it, does
not appear to be any where so used, either in the Bible, or in any other
writings. Kimchi interprets it shivers, fragments, broken pieces of
anything. Jarchi says it signifies, in the Syriac language, beams,
planks, and boards, pieces of them; so the Targum and Ben Melech from
the Rabbins; or rather the dust which falls from them in sawing,
sawdust; to dust as small as that should this calf be reduced, as the
golden calf was ground to powder by Moses, to which, it is thought,
there is an allusion.

[Hosea 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 8:7</span></span>

For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind,.... The
sense is, the Israelites took a great deal of pains in the idolatrous
worship of the calves, and made a great stir, bustle, and noise in it,
like the wind; were very vainglorious and ostentatious, made a great
show of religion and devotion, and promised themselves great things from
it, peace and plenty, wealth and riches, all prosperity and happiness,
enjoyed by Heathen nations; but this was lost labour, it was labouring
for the wind, or sowing that; they got nothing by it, or what was worse
than nothing; it proved not only useless, but hurtful, to them; for, for
their idolatry, and continuance in it, the whirlwind of God's wrath
would be raised up against them, and the Assyrian army, like a vehement
storm of wind, would rush in upon them, and destroy them; so they that
sow to the flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption, [Gal
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#008.md);

it hath no stalk; what they sowed did not rise up above ground; or, if
it did, it did not spring up in a blade or stalk, which was promising of
fruit; no real good, profit, and advantage, sprung from their idolatrous
practices:

the bud shall yield no meal; yea, though it rise up into a stalk, and
this stalk produced ears of corn, yet those so thin, that no meal or
flour could be got out of them, and so of no worth and use:

and if so be it yield: any meal or flour:

the strangers shall swallow it up; the Israelites should not be the
better for it; it should till come into the hands of foreigners, the
Assyrian army. The meaning is, that if they did prosper and increase in
riches, yet they should not long enjoy them themselves, but be pillaged
and spoiled of them; as they were by the exactions of Pul, and by the
depredations of Shalmaneser, kings of Assyria. So the Targum,

"if they got substance, the nations shall spoil them of it.''

[Hosea 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 8:8</span></span>

Israel is swallowed up,.... Not only their substance, but their persons
also, the whole nation of them, their whole estate, civil and
ecclesiastic: it notes the utter destruction of them by the Assyrians,
so that nothing of them and theirs remained; just as anyone is swallowed
up and devoured by a breast of prey; the present is put for the future,
because of the certainty of it:

now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein is no pleasure;
when Shalmaneser took Samaria, and with it swallowed up the whole
kingdom of Israel, he carried captive the inhabitants of it, and placed
them among the nations, in "Halah, Habor, by the river Gozan", and in
the cities of the Medes, [Kg2 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006.md);
where they lived poor, mean, and abject, and were treated with the
utmost neglect and contempt; no more regarded than a broken useless
vessel, or than a vessel of dishonour, that is made and used for the
ease of nature, for which no more regard is had than for that service:
thus idolaters, who dishonour God by their idolatries, shall, sooner or
later, be brought to disgrace and dishonour themselves.

[Hosea 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 8:9</span></span>

For they are gone up to Assyria,.... Or, "though they should go up to
Assyria" (g); to the king of Assyria, to gain his friendship, and enter
into alliance with him; as, when Pal king of Assyria came against them,
Menahem king of Israel went forth to meet him, and gave him a thousand
talents of silver to be his confederate, and strengthen his kingdom,
[Kg2 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#019.md); yet this hindered not but
that Israel was at length swallowed up by that people, and scattered by
them among the nations; for this is not to be understood of their going
captive into the land of Assyria, as the Targum interprets it:

a wild ass alone by himself; which may be applied either to the king of
Assyria, and be considered as a description of him, to whom Israel went
for help and friendship; who, though he took their present, and made
them fair promises, yet was perfidious, unsociable, and inhuman, studied
only his own advantage, and not their good: or to the Israelites that
went to him, who were as sottish and stupid as the ass, and as
headstrong and unruly as that, and, like it, lustful, and impetuous in
their lusts; running to and fro for the satisfying of them, and taking
no advice, nor suffering themselves to be controlled, and, being alone,
became an easy prey to the Assyrian lion: or yet they should be as "a
wild ass alone by itself" (h); notwithstanding all the methods they took
to obtain the friendship and alliance of the king of Assyria, yet they
should be carried captive by him, and dwell in the captivity like a wild
ass in the wilderness; and so it is to be understood here, agreeably to
[Job 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#005); otherwise, as Bochart (i.md)
has proved from various writers, these creatures go in flocks:

Ephraim hath hired lovers; by giving presents to the kings of Assyria
and Egypt, to be their allies and confederates, patrons and defenders,
[Kg2 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#019.md); who are represented as
their gallants, with whom Ephraim or the ten tribes committed adultery,
departing from God their Husband, and liege Lord and King, and from his
true worship; see [Eze 16:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#026.md). R. Elias
Levita (k) observes, that some interpret the words, "Ephraim made a
covenant with lovers".

\(g\) "quamvis, etiamsi ascenderint"; so Schmidt observes it may be
rendered, though he chooses to render it by "quando", "when they should
go up", &c. (h) "erunt onager, qui solitarius sibi est", Schmidt. (i)
Hierozoic. par. 1. l. 3. c. 16. col. 870. (k) Tishbi, p. 267.

[Hosea 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 8:10</span></span>

Yea, though they have hired among the nations,.... That is, lovers, as
before; got into confederacies and alliances with the nations about
them, thinking thereby to strengthen their hands, and secure themselves
and their kingdom; particular regard may be had to the Egyptians, as
distinct from the Assyrians, whom they privately engaged on their side
to shake off the Assyrian yoke, or their obligation to send yearly
presents to the Assyrian king:

now will I gather them; either the Assyrians against them, to invade
their land, besiege their city, and take and carry them captive; or the
Israelites in a body into the city of Samaria, and there be cooped up,
and taken and destroyed, or carried captive; for this is not to be
interpreted of the collection of them out of their captivity, as the
Targum and Jarchi, but of the gathering of them together for their
destruction:

and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes;
the tax or tribute imposed upon them by the king of Assyria, whose
princes were altogether kings, [Isa
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#008.md); and who used to be called king
of kings, being at the head of a monarchy, which had many kings subject
to it; as the kings of Babylon were afterwards called, [Eze
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#007.md); this may refer to the yearly
present or tribute, which Hoshea king of Israel was obliged to give to
the king of Assyria, which he was very uneasy at, and did not pay it,
which drew upon him the resentment of the Assyrian king; and that sorrow
and uneasiness which that tribute gave the king of Israel and his people
were but little and small in comparison of what they after found; it was
the beginning of sorrows to them: and so some render the words, "they
began" (l); that is, to sorrow and complain "a little"; or this may
refer to their burdens and oppressions when in captivity, which were
laid upon them by the king of Assyria, and the princes, the rulers, and
governors of the several places where the Israelites were carried
captive: even the "few that shall remain" (m), as some render it; and
not die by famine, pestilence, and sword. Kimchi and Ben Melech think
there is a deficiency of the copulative and between king and princes;
which is supplied by the Targum, and by the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin,
Syriac, and Arabic versions, which read, "the king and princes".

[Hosea 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 8:11</span></span>

Because Ephraim hath, made many altars to sin,.... Not with an intention
to commit sin, but to offer sacrifice for sin, and make atonement for
it, as they thought; but these altars being erected for the sake of
idols, and sacrifices offered on them to them, they sinned in so doing,
and were the cause of sin in others, who were drawn into it by their
example; as they were made to sin, or drawn into it, by Jeroboam their
king, These altars were those set up at Dan and Bethel, and in all high
places, and tops of mountains, where they sacrificed to idols; and which
was contrary to the express command of God, who required sacrifice only
at one place, and on one altar, [Deu
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#005.md); typical of the one altar Christ,
and his alone sacrifice, who is the only Mediator between God and man;
and they are guilty of the same crime as Ephraim here, who make use of
more, or neglect him;

altars shall be unto him for sin; either these same altars, and the
sacrifices offered on them, shall be reckoned and imputed to him as
sins, trod shall be the cause of his condemnation and punishment: or,
"let the altars be unto him for sin", so some (n); since he will have
them, let him have them, and go on in sinning, till he has filled up the
measure of his sins, and brought on him just condemnation; or else other
altars are meant, even in the land of Assyria, where, since they were so
fond of multiplying altars, they should have altars enough to sin at,
whereby their sins would be increased, and their punishment for them
aggravated. The Targum is,

"seeing the house of Ephraim hath multiplied altars to sin, the altars
of their idols shall he to them for a stumbling block,''

or ruin; so sin is taken in a different sense, both for guilt, and the
punishment of it.

[Hosea 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hos 8:12</span></span>

I have written to him the great things of my law,.... Which was given by
Moses to Israel at the appointment of God, in which were many commands,
holy, just, and true; a multiplicity of them, as the Targum, relating to
the honour of God, and the good of men; many excellent and useful ones
of a moral nature, and others of a ceremonial kind; and particularly
concerning sacrifices, showing what they should be, the nature and use
of them, and where and on what altar they should be offered; and which
pointed at the great sacrifice of the Messiah, who is both altar,
sacrifice, and priest: and these things were frequently inculcated by
the prophets, who from time to time were sent unto them; so that the
Lord was continually writing these things to them by them, as Jarchi,
Kimchi, and Ben Melech interpret it; hence they could not plead
ignorance, and excuse themselves on that account. The law sometimes not
only designs the law of the decalogue, and the ceremonial law,
respecting sacrifices, &c. but all the books of Moses, in which are
written many great and excellent things concerning Christ, his person,
offices, and grace; yea, all the books of the prophets, the whole of
Scripture, which is by inspiration of God, and is the writing and word
of God, and not men; and of which holy men of God were the "amanuenses";
and in which many valuable and precious things are recorded, even all
the works of God, of creation, providence, and grace; yea, the various
thoughts, counsels, and purposes of his heart, relating to the salvation
of men, are transcribed here; and the manifold grace of God, or each of
the doctrines of grace, are contained herein, especially in the
doctrinal and evangelical part of it, which is sometimes called the law
of the Lord, even of Christ; and the law or doctrine of faith; see [Psa
119:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#018.md); here are delivered and held
forth the great doctrines of a trinity of Persons in the Godhead; of the
everlasting love of God to his people, and of their choice in Christ
before the world began; of the covenant of grace; of the incarnation of
Christ; of redemption by him; of peace, pardon, righteousness, and
atonement, through him; of eternal salvation by him; these things are
written, and to be read and referred unto, and observed as the rule of
faith and practice, and not unwritten traditions, pretended revelations,
reveries, and dreams of men; and written they were, not for the use of
the Israelites only under the former dispensation, but for the learning
and instruction of us Gentiles also, [Rom
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#002.md);

but they were counted as a strange thing; the laws respecting sacrifices
more especially, and the place where they were to be offered, which are
the things mentioned in the context, had been so long disregarded and
disused by Ephraim or the ten tribes, that when they were put in mind of
them by the prophets, they looked upon them as things they had no
concern with; as laws that belonged to another people, and not to them:
and so the great things of divine revelation, the great doctrines of the
Gospel, are treated by many as things they have nothing to do with, not
at all interesting to them; yea, as nauseous and despicable things,
deserving their scorn and contempt, very ungrateful and disagreeable,
and in this sense strange, as Job's breath was to his wife [Job
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#017.md); and also as foreign to reason
and good sense, and what cannot be reconciled thereunto: so the
Athenians charged the doctrines of the Apostle Paul as strange,
irrational, and unaccountable, [Act
17:20](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#020.md).

[Hosea 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hos 8:13</span></span>

They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings,

and eat it,.... Or, "as to the sacrifices mine offerings" or "gifts,
they sacrifice flesh, and eat it" (o); these sacrifices, which,
according to the law, should given to God when they offered them, they
did not give them to him, they took them to themselves, and ate them;
they were carnal offerings, and offered with a carnal mind, without
faith and piety, without any regard to the glory of God, but merely for
the sake of caring: the Targum interprets it of sacrifices got by
rapine, which God hates, [Isa 61:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#008.md);

but the Lord accepteth them not; neither the sacrifices, nor the
sacrificers, but despised and abhorred them; no sacrifice was acceptable
to God but what was offered according to law, and where he directed, and
in the faith of Christ, and through him:

now will he remember their iniquities, and visit their sins; he will not
pardon them, but punish for them; so far were their sacrifices making
atonement for them, as they expected, they added to the measure of their
iniquities:

they shall return into Egypt; either flee thither for refuge, many of
them it seems did, when the king of Assyria entered their land, and
besieged Samaria; where they lived miserably, as in exile, and were
there buried, and never returned to their own land any more; see [Hos
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#003.md); or they should be carried captive
into Assyria, where they should be in a like state of bondage as their
fathers were in Egypt. Some render it, "they return into Egypt" (p); and
consider it not as their punishment, but as their sin; that when the
Lord was about to visit them for their transgressions, they being made
tributary to the Assyrians, instead of returning to the Lord, and
humbling themselves before him, they sent to the king of Egypt for help,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hos 8:14</span></span>

For Israel hath forgotten his Maker,.... The Creator and Preserver of
everyone of them, and who had raised them up to a state and kingdom, and
had made them great and rich, and populous, and bestowed many favours
and blessings on them; and yet they forgot him, to give him glory, and
to serve and worship him:

and buildeth temples; to idols, as the Targum adds; to the calves at Dan
and Bethel, at which places, as there were altars set up, and priests
appointed, so temples and houses of high places built to worship in; see
[Kg1 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#031.md);

and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities; to protect them from their
enemies, which was not unlawful; but that they should put their trust
and confidence in them, and not in the Lord their God, which was their
sin; when they saw the ten tribes carried captive by the Assyrians, they
betook themselves to such methods for their security, but were not
careful to avoid those sins which brought ruin upon Israel:

but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces
thereof; that is, an enemy, that should set fire to their cities,
particularly Jerusalem their chief city, and burn the temple of the
Lord, the palaces of their king and nobles, and all the fine houses of
the great men; which was done many years after this prophecy, by
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, [Jer
52:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#013.md).
