### [Mark Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#001.md)

[Mark 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 14:1</span></span>

After two days was the feast of the passover,.... That is, two days
after Christ had delivered the foregoing discourse concerning the
destruction of the temple at Jerusalem, was the feast of the passover;
which was kept in commemoration of God's passing over the houses of the
Israelites, when he destroyed the firstborn of Egypt, and made way for
the deliverance of the children of Israel from thence: and which was
kept by eating the passover lamb; and which, properly speaking, is the
feast of the passover:

and of unleavened bread; which was the same feast with the other, called
so from the unleavened bread which was then eaten; though with this
difference, the passover lamb was only eaten on the first night, but
unleavened bread was eaten for seven days together. The Syriac, Persic,
and Ethiopic versions render it, "the passover of unleavened bread",
leaving out the copulative "and".

And the chief priests and Scribes sought how they might take him by
craft; that is, Jesus,

and put him to death: for which purpose they assembled together in
Caiaphas the high priest's palace, and there took counsel together how
to accomplish it; see [Mat 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#002.md).

[Mark 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 14:2</span></span>

But they said not on the feast day,.... The feast of the passover, and
of unleavened bread, which was nigh at hand, and would be two days
hence, when there would be a great concourse of people from all parts to
keep it: and therefore they did not choose to seize him, and put him to
death at that time,

lest there should be an uproar of the people; or among them, lest they
should rise in his favour, and rescue him out of their hands; See Gill
on [Mat 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#005.md).

[Mark 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 14:3</span></span>

And being in Bethany,.... A place about two miles from Jerusalem,
whither he retired after he had took his leave of the temple, and had
predicted its destruction; a place he often went to, and from, the last
week of his life; having some dear friends, and familiar acquaintance
there, as Lazarus, and his two sisters, Martha and Mary, and the person
next mentioned:

in the house of Simon the leper; so called because he had been one, and
to distinguish him from Simon the Pharisee, and Simon Peter the apostle,
and others; See Gill on [Mat 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#006.md);

as he sat at meat there came a woman; generally thought to be Mary
Magdalene, or Mary the sister of Lazarus:

having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard; or "pure nard",
unmixed and genuine; or liquid nard, which was drinkable, and so easy to
be poured out; or Pistic nard, called so, either from "Pista", the name
of a place from whence it was brought, or from "Pistaca", which, with
the Rabbins, signifies "maste"; of which, among other things, this
ointment was made. Moreover, ointment of nard was made both of the
leaves of nard, and called foliate nard, and of the spikes of it, and
called, as here, spikenard. Now ointment made of nard was, as Pliny says
(w), the principal among ointments. The Syriac is, by him, said to be
the best; this here is said to be

very precious, costly, and valuable:

and she brake the box. The Syriac and Ethiopic versions render it, "she
opened it"; and the Persic version, "she opened the head", or "top of
the bottle", or "vial":

and poured it on his head; on the head of Christ, as the same version
presses it; See Gill on [Mat 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#007.md).

\(w\) Nat. Hist. l. 12. c. 12.

[Mark 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mar 14:4</span></span>

And there were some that had indignation within themselves,.... The
Syriac version reads, "some of the disciples": agreeably to [Mat
26:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#008.md), particularly Judas, and others
might be incensed by his means:

and said, why was this waste of the ointment made? See Gill on [Mat
26:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#008.md).

[Mark 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mar 14:5</span></span>

For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence,....
Which, was to the value of our money nine pounds, seven shillings, and
sixpence:

and given to the poor; which was thought to be a better way of expending
it, than by pouring it on the head of Christ:

and they murmured against her: that she should lavish so much money away
in such an imprudent manner; they reproved her for it, expressed much
resentment at it, and were very angry with, her upon the account of it;
See Gill on [Mat 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#008.md), [Mat
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#009.md).

[Mark 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mar 14:6</span></span>

And Jesus said, let her alone,.... Jesus knowing the secret indignation
of some of his disciples, and their private murmurings at the woman, and
their continual teasings of her, because of the expense of the ointment,
said to them, as the Arabic and Ethiopic versions read; or "to the
disciples", as the Persic, let the woman alone, cease to chide and
reprove her for what she has done;

why trouble ye her? why do you grieve her, by charging her with
imprudence and extravagance, as if she had been guilty of a very great
crime? she is so far from it, that

she hath wrought a good work on me; she has done me an honour; expressed
faith in me, and shown love to me, and ought to be commended, and not
reproved; See Gill on [Mat 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#010.md).

[Mark 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 14:7</span></span>

For ye have the poor with you always,.... See Gill on [Mat
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#011.md);

and whensoever ye will ye may do them good; by feeding them when hungry,
clothing them when naked, and supplying them with the necessaries of
life:

but me ye have not always; meaning, with respect to his bodily presence,
which, in a short time, would be removed from them, and they would have
no opportunity of showing him any such outward respect personally; See
Gill on [Mat 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#011.md).

[Mark 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mar 14:8</span></span>

She hath done what she could,.... What she had in her heart, and in the
power of her hands to do; she hath done according to her ability, and
her good will; and if she had not done it now, she could not have done
it at all.

She is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying; or, "as if it
was to bury me", as the Syriac version renders it. Christ signifies by
this, that he should shortly die, and that this woman came before hand
to anoint him, and, as it were, to perform the funeral rites before he
was dead; it being revealed to her by the Spirit, that Jesus would
quickly die, and she should not be able to perform this good work when
dead, and therefore came to do it before; or, at least, she was directed
by the Spirit of God, because she would be prevented doing it
afterwards; See Gill on [Mat 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#012.md).

[Mark 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 14:9</span></span>

Verily I say unto you,.... And you may assure yourselves of the truth of
it:

wheresoever this Gospel, of the death and resurrection of Christ,

shall be preached throughout the whole world, as it shall be,

this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her;
in remembrance of her, and her work, and in commendation of her faith,
love, and duty; See Gill on [Mat
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#013.md).

[Mark 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 14:10</span></span>

And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve,.... Apostles of Christ; who was
the principal person that had indignation at the woman, and murmured
against her, for the profusion of the ointment:

went unto the chief priests; as soon as this affair was over, and Christ
had defended the woman's conduct to his shame and silence: he
immediately went out of the house, where they were, and set out from
Bethany to Jerusalem; and understanding the chief priests were in
consultation together at Caiaphas's house, how to apprehend Jesus, and
put him to death, went directly to them, unsent for, and unthought of by
them:

to betray him unto them; which Satan had put into his heart, and what
his avarice and revenge for the late action of the woman, and Christ's
defence of it, prompted him to; See Gill on [Mat
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#014.md).

[Mark 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 14:11</span></span>

And when they heard it, they were glad,.... That such an opportunity
offered, and from such a quarter, by one of his own disciples; so that
it might be done more secretly and effectually, and with less blame to
themselves:

and promised to give him money; any sum he should ask; and what was
agreed upon were thirty pieces, or shekels of silver; and so the
Ethiopic version here, instead of money, reads, "thirty pieces of
silver"; See Gill on [Mat 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#015.md).

And he sought how he might conveniently betray him; after this promise,
and upon this agreement: henceforward he sought the most fitting
opportunity, and the best season of betraying his master into the hands
of these men, when he was alone, and the multitude absent, and there was
no danger of a tumult, or a rescue; See Gill on [Mat
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#016.md).

[Mark 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 14:12</span></span>

And the first day of unleavened bread,.... Being come, which was the
fourteenth of Nisan:

when they killed the passover; that is, "the Jews", as the Syriac and
Persic versions supply; for any Israelite, that not a priest, might slay
it: their canon runs thus (x),

"an Israelite kills (the passover), and a priest receives (the blood),
and gives it to his neighbour, and his neighbour to his neighbour, and
he receives (the basin) full, and returns it empty; the priest that is
near to the altar sprinkles it, at one sprinkling, over against the
bottom of it.''

Upon which the commentators (y) observe, that the slaying of the
passover by strangers; that is, such as are not priests, lawful. And so
Philo the Jew, speaking of the passover, says (z);

"at which time the common people do not bring their sacrifices to the
altar, and the priests slay; but by the command of the law, , "the whole
nation", does the work of a priest; every one particularly bringing the
sacrifices for himself, and then slaying them with his own hands.''

But then it was always killed in the court of the temple, and after the
middle of the day; See Gill on [Mat
26:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#017.md);

his disciples said unto him, where wilt thou that we go and prepare,
that thou mayst eat the passover: for it was now Thursday morning, and
the passover was to be slain after the middle of the day, between the
two evenings, and eaten in Jerusalem at night; and they were now at
Bethany, near two miles from the city; and it was usual for servants to
get ready the passover for their masters; See Gill on [Mat
26:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#017.md).

[Mark 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 14:13</span></span>

And he sendeth forth two of his disciples,.... Peter and John, as
appears from [Luk 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#008.md);

and saith unto them, go ye into the city; the city of Jerusalem; for
there only the passover might be eaten, [Deu
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#002.md);

and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water; a servant of
the master of the house that was sent for water, to mix with the wine,
at the passover:

follow him; into the house to which he goes.

[Mark 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 14:14</span></span>

And wheresoever he shall go in,.... Into whatsoever house he shall
enter, go in after him:

and say ye to the good man of the house; the owner, and master of it,
who might be Nicodemus, or Joseph of Arimathea, or some man of note and
wealth in Jerusalem, that might have some knowledge of Christ, and faith
in him, though he did not openly profess him; since by only saying what
follows, he would at once, as he did, direct them to a suitable and
convenient room;

the master saith. The Syriac and Persic versions read, our master saith:
he that is yours, and ours, our master Jesus; though that is not
expressed, yet it was understood by the master of the family; which
confirms the above conjecture, that he was a secret disciple of Christ.

Where is the guest chamber; the chamber provided for guests that might
be expected at the passover:

where I shall eat the passover with my disciples? where it might be done
conveniently, and in a proper and comfortable manner; See Gill on [Mat
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#018.md).

[Mark 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 14:15</span></span>

And he will show you a large upper room,.... A room in the highest part
of the house, large enough for such a company, for thirteen persons,
which was the number of Christ and his disciples:

furnished and prepared; with a table, and a sufficient number of couches
to sit, or lie upon, and with all proper vessels necessary on such an
occasion:

there make ready for us; the passover.

[Mark 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mar 14:16</span></span>

And his disciples went forth,.... The two disciples, as the Arabic
version has it, Peter and John, set out from Bethany to Jerusalem
directly:

and came into the city; the city of Jerusalem:

and found as he had said unto them; a man bearing a pitcher of water,
whom they followed to the house he went into, and addressed the master
of the house, as Jesus had bid them; when he showed them an upper room,
very commodious and fit for the purpose, as Christ had said; and which
is a considerable proof of the prescience of Christ:

and they made ready the passover; they bought a lamb; they had it killed
in the temple, according to rule; and they brought it to the house,
where they were to sup, and got it roasted; and provided unleavened
bread, and wine, and bitter herbs, and every thing that was proper for
the feast; See Gill on [Mat 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#019.md).

[Mark 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mar 14:17</span></span>

And in the evening he cometh with the twelve. In the afternoon, as it is
very reasonable to suppose, Christ set out from Bethany with the rest of
the twelve, with the other nine, and came to Jerusalem; where they were
joined by Judas, who had covenanted with the chief priests to betray
him, and by Peter and John, who had been sent before to prepare the
passover; and when it was night, when the second evening had took place,
he went with all twelve of them to the house, where the provision to eat
the passover together was made for them; See Gill on [Mat
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#020.md).

[Mark 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mar 14:18</span></span>

And as they sat and did eat,.... Or "as they lay along"; for such was
their posture at the eating of the passover; See Gill on [Mat
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#020.md),

Jesus said, verily I say unto you, one of you which eateth with me shall
betray me; See Gill on [Mat 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#021.md).

[Mark 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mar 14:19</span></span>

And they began to be sorrowful,.... And were so, all but Judas, at this
saying of Christ's:

and to say unto him, one by one; even till it came to Judas himself,

is it I? that shall betray thee;

and another said, is it I? This clause is wanting in the Vulgate Latin,
Syriac, Arabic, Persic, and Ethiopic versions, and in two of Beza's
copies; and indeed seems to be redundant, since the disciples are said
before to express themselves in this manner, one by one; See Gill on
[Mat 26:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#022.md).

[Mark 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mar 14:20</span></span>

And he answered and said unto them,.... In order to relieve their minds,
and point out the particular person:

it is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish; just at that
very instant; See Gill on [Mat 26:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#023.md).

[Mark 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mar 14:21</span></span>

The son of man indeed goeth,.... Out of this world by death,

as it is written; both in the book of God's decrees, and in the
Scriptures of the Old Testament;

but woe to that man by whom the son of man is betrayed! whose sin will
not be excused, nor lessened by fulfilling the decrees of God, and by
accomplishing the prophecies of the Bible:

good were it for that man if he had never been born; so aggravating will
be his crime, so dreadful his punishment; See Gill on [Mat
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#024.md).

[Mark 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mar 14:22</span></span>

And as they did eat,.... The paschal lamb, and the unleavened bread,
just at the conclusion of that feast:

Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it; beginning and instituting a
new feast, to be kept in aftertimes, in commemoration of his sufferings
and death, now near at hand;

and gave to them, the disciples,

and said, take, eat: the word eat is not in the Vulgate Latin, Syriac,
Arabic, Persic, and Ethiopic versions, and is wanting in some copies:

this is body; a figure and representation of it; See Gill on [Mat
26:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#026.md).

[Mark 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mar 14:23</span></span>

And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks,.... Over it, and for
it, by blessing it, and appropriating it to the present use and service:

he gave it to them; his disciples,

and they all drank of it; Judas, as well as the rest, as he bid them do;
See Gill on [Mat 26:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#027.md).

[Mark 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 14:24</span></span>

And he said unto them,.... Not after they had drank of it, but before,
and as he gave it to them:

this is my blood of the New Testament, which is shed for many; in
Matthew it is added, "for the remission of sins"; See Gill on [Mat
26:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#028.md).

[Mark 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mar 14:25</span></span>

Verily I say unto you,.... This seems, to have been said after the
eating of the passover, according to [Luk
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#018.md), but was, in reality, not till
after the Lord's supper was ended, and the last cup was drank, which was
wont to be drank at the passover:

I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine; that is, wine,

until that day that I drink it new; in a figurative and mystical sense;
by which are meant the joys of heaven:

in the kingdom of God; Father, Son, and Spirit, upon the general
resurrection of the dead, when the kingdom of the Mediator will be
delivered up, and there will be no distinction of government; but God,
Father, Son, and Spirit, will be all in all, and shall reign in the
saints, and they with them, to all eternity; See Gill on [Mat
26:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#029.md).

[Mark 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 14:26</span></span>

And when they had sung an hymn,.... The Hallell, used at the passover:

they went out into the Mount of Olives; Christ, and eleven of his
disciples; for Judas now separated from them, and went to the chief
priests to acquaint them how things were, where Jesus was going, and
where they might apprehend him; See Gill on [Mat
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#030.md).

[Mark 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 14:27</span></span>

And Jesus saith unto them,.... As they were going to the Mount of
Olives. The Persic version reads, in this place; meaning the Mount of
Olives, having got thither:

all ye shall be offended because of me this night; See Gill on [Mat
26:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#031.md);

for it is written in [Zac 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#007.md),

I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: Christ is
meant by the shepherd, and the apostles by the sheep. The Syriac version
reads, "his sheep".

[Mark 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mar 14:28</span></span>

But after that I am risen,.... From the dead, which, for their comfort,
he assures them of; though they would be offended and discouraged at the
seizing, and condemning, and crucifixion of him:

I will go before you into Galilee; the place of their nativity, and
where he had often conversed with them; See Gill on [Mat
26:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#032.md).

[Mark 14:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mar 14:29</span></span>

But Peter said unto him,.... Being greatly moved at what Christ had
said, that all of them would be offended with him that night, and run
away from him, and be scattered from him, and one another:

although all shall be offended, yet will not I; though all the rest of
the disciples, the other ten, should do as Judas had done, should fall
off from Christ, and either betray him, or deny him, or, at least, turn
their backs on him, yet he would do neither; See Gill on [Mat
26:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#033.md).

[Mark 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mar 14:30</span></span>

And Jesus saith unto him, verily I say unto thee,.... As confident as
thou art of standing by me, and abiding with me;

that this day, which was then begun; for the Jews reckoned their days
from evening, as in [Gen 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#005.md);

even in this night; this night to be observed, this night of the
passover, before it is past:

before the cock crow twice; for there was a first and second cock
crowing, the one at midnight, and the other near break of day, and which
last is properly the cock crowing: the word "twice" is left out in the
Ethiopic version:

thou shalt deny me thrice; as he did; See Gill on [Mat
26:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#034.md).

[Mark 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mar 14:31</span></span>

But he spake the more vehemently,.... With a louder voice; with more
spirit and eagerness; in a more peremptory and self-confident way.

If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. The Syriac
version adds, "O my Lord", my dear Lord, I will never deny thee upon any
consideration whatever; and the Persic version, O Lord:

likewise also said they all; as he said, so said "all the disciples", as
the Syriac version reads it; See Gill on [Mat
26:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#035.md).

And they came to a place which is named Gethsemane,.... At the foot of
the Mount of Olives, where the olives, which grew in great plenty on the
mount, were pressed: and where our Lord began to be bruised, for our
sins:

and be saith to his disciples: to eight of them:

sit ye here while I shall pray; at some distance from hence; See Gill on
[Mat 26:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#036.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mar 14:33</span></span>

And he taketh with him Peter, and James, and John,.... Who were
witnesses of his transfiguration on the mount, and now of his sorrows in
the garden:

and began to be sore amazed; to be in great consternation and
astonishment, at the sight of all the sins of his people coming upon
him; at the black storm of wrath, that was gathering thick over him; at
the sword of justice which was brandished against him; and at the curses
of the righteous law, which, like so many thunderbolts of vengeance,
were directed at him: no wonder it should be added,

and to be very heavy: both with sin and sorrow; See Gill on [Mat
26:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#037.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mar 14:34</span></span>

And saith unto them,.... The above three disciples;

my soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: he was surrounded with
sorrow, and it pressed him so hard, and close, on every side, that he
was just ready to die with it:

tarry ye here, and watch: in Matthew it is added, "with me": See Gill on
[Mat 26:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#038.md).

And he went forward a little,.... About a stone's cast, [Luk
22:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#041.md),

and fell on the ground, and prayed; he fell on his face to the ground,
which was a praying posture. One of the Jewish canons concerning it, is
this (a):

"worshipping, how is it done? after a man has lifted up his head; he
bows it five times, he sits upon the ground, and "falls upon his face",
"to the ground", and supplicates with whatsoever supplication he
pleases: worshipping, or bowing, is the stretching out of hands and
feet, until a man is found cast upon his face to the ground.''

See Gill on [Mat 26:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#039.md). The
supplication Christ made in this posture was,

that, it were possible, the hour might pass from him; the time fixed and
agreed upon for his sufferings and death; that is, that it might pass
without his enduring them, if there was any possibility of excusing him,
and of his people's being saved without them; See Gill on [Mat
26:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#039.md).

And he said, Abba, Father,.... In the original text, the former of these
is a Syriac word, and the latter a Greek one, explanative of the former,
as in [Rom 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015.md) and [Gal
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006.md) or the repetition is made, to
express the vehemency of his affection, and his strong confidence in
God, as his Father, amidst his distress, as the Syriac version renders
it, , "Abba, my Father": or "my Father, my Father"; and so the Ethiopic
version:

all things are possible unto thee; so Philo the Jew (b), taking notice
of Isaac's question about the burnt offering, and Abraham's answer to
it, represents the latter as adding, in confirmation of it,

"all things are possible to God, and which are both difficult and
impossible to be done by men;''

suggesting, that God could easily provide a lamb for a sacrifice; and
Christ here intimates, that every thing consistent with his perfections,
counsels, and covenant, were possible to be done by him; and how far
what he prays for, was agreeable to these, he submits to him, and to his
sovereign will:

take away this cup from me; nevertheless, not what I will, but what thou
wilt: See Gill on [Mat 26:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#039.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mar 14:37</span></span>

And he cometh and findeth them sleeping,.... His three disciples, Peter,
James, and John:

and saith unto Peter; particularly, he having so lately asserted, with
so much confidence, his love to Christ, and close attachment to him:

Simon, sleepest thou? Christ calls him by the name he first went by, and
not by that which he had given him, Cephas, or Peter; he not now having
that firmness and constancy, though he boasted of it, which answers to
that name:

couldst thou not watch one hour? The Arabic and Persic versions add,
with me; and so does the Complutensian edition; See Gill on [Mat
26:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#040.md).

[Mark 14:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mar 14:38</span></span>

Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation,.... Of denying Christ,
and falling off from him, which would quickly offer to them, when they
should see him apprehended, bound, and led away.

The spirit truly is ready. The Persic version renders it, "my mind"; as
if the Spirit or soul of Christ was meant; whereas it is either to be
understood of the evil spirit, Satan, who was disposed to attack them,
and especially Peter, whom he desired to have, and sift as wheat; or
else the spirit of the disciples, their renewed spirit, which was ready
and disposed watching and praying, and willing to abide by Christ:

but the flesh is weak; they were but flesh and blood, and so not a match
of themselves for so powerful an adversary as Satan, and therefore had
need to watch and pray; or "their body", as the Syriac, Arabic, and
Persic versions render it, was weak, and subject to drowsiness and
sleep; and especially they were weak and feeble, and very unequal of
themselves for spiritual exercises, as they had flesh, or a corrupt
nature in them; See Gill on [Mat
26:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#041.md).

[Mark 14:39](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">mar 14:39</span></span>

And again he went away,.... To the same place, or at much such a
distance from them, as before:

and prayed and spake the same words; or word, that is, the same matter;
for here, answers to which signifies a thing, or matter, as well as
word: Christ prayed to the same effect, for matter and substance the
same as before, though not in the same express words, as is clear from
[Mat 26:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#039.md).

[Mark 14:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">mar 14:40</span></span>

And when he returned, he found them asleep again,.... Notwithstanding
the expostulation he had used with them, the exhortation he had given
them, and the danger he had suggested to them:

for their eyes were heavy: with sleep and sorrow:

neither wist they what to answer him; partly through confusion and
shame, not knowing how to excuse themselves; and partly, through their
being stupefied with sleep and grief.

[Mark 14:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mar 14:41</span></span>

And he cometh the third time,.... After he had prayed a third time, to
the same purport as before:

and saith unto them, sleep on now, and take your rest; which words are
spoken ironically:

it is enough; or "the end is come"; as the Syriac and Arabic versions
render it, of watching and praying:

the hour is come, behold the son of man is betrayed into the hands of
sinners; both Jews and Gentiles, by one of his own disciples; See Gill
on [Mat 26:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#045.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">mar 14:42</span></span>

Rise up let us go,.... To meet the enemy and the danger; for there is no
escaping;

lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand; Judas, that he had hinted at supper
should betray him, was now about doing it; and was just now coming upon
him, in order to deliver him into the hands of the Jews, and the Roman
band of soldiers; See Gill on [Mat
26:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#046.md).

[Mark 14:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">mar 14:43</span></span>

And immediately, while he yet spake,.... The above words:

cometh Judas one of the twelve: apostles of Christ, and which was an
aggravation of his wickedness; the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic,
Persic, and Ethiopic, versions add, "Iscariot"; and so it is read in one
of Beza's copies. The Ethiopic version reads, "one of the ten", very
wrongly:

and with him a great multitude; a band of men and officers, with many of
the chief priests and captains of the temple, and elders of the people,
that mixed themselves with the crowd, to see how things would issue:

with swords and staves; which they intended to make use of, should any
resistance be made in apprehending him, or any attempt to rescue him:

from the chief priests, and the Scribes, and the elders; from the Jewish
sanhedrim, which consisted of these; See Gill on [Mat
26:47](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#047.md).

[Mark 14:44](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">mar 14:44</span></span>

And he that betrayed him had given them a token,.... A common sign, in
which they agreed; and so this same Greek word is used by the Jews (c):

"said R. Phinehas in the name of R. Reuben, did you ever see one man go
out of the north, and another from the south, and meet each other,
except they made, "a common sign", between them.''

Such an one the traitor gave his company;

saying, whomsoever I shall kiss, the same is he; Jesus of Nazareth; who
was to be delivered to them:

take him, and lead him away safely; with care and caution, lest he
should get out of their hands, and make his escape, as he had sometimes
done: the word "safely", is omitted in the Arabic, Persic, and Ethiopic
versions. The Vulgate Latin renders it "cautiously", and so does the
Syriac version, which joins it to the words, "take him"; See Gill on
[Mat 26:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#048.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">mar 14:45</span></span>

And as soon as he was come,.... To the place where Jesus was:

he goeth straightway to him; alone; as if he had nothing to do with the
company behind, and as if he was his friend, and concerned for his
safety:

and saith, Master, Master; expressing great affection for him, and
respect to him, by repeating this word. The Ethiopic version has it but
once, and so two exemplars of Beza's; and the Vulgate Latin reads,
"hail, Master", as in [Mat 26:49](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#049.md).

and kissed him; See Gill on [Mat

[Mark 14:46](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">mar 14:46</span></span>

And they laid hands on him, and took him. After Christ had said to
Judas, "friend, wherefore art thou come?" as in Matthew; and also,
"Judas, betrayest thou the son of man with a kiss?" as in [Luk
22:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#048.md); See Gill on [Mat

And one of them that stood by,.... One of the disciples that stood by
Jesus, as Judas was betraying him, and the soldiers were laying hold on
him, Peter by name:

drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his
ear; his right ear; the servant's name was Malchus; See Gill on [Mat

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">mar 14:48</span></span>

captains of the temple, and the elders, that came with the band and
officers, as appears from [Luk 22:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#052.md).
The Persic version reads, "to the multitude":

are ye come out as against a thief, with swords and with staves, to take
me? See Gill on [Mat 26:55](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#055.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">mar 14:49</span></span>

I was daily with you in the temple,.... That is, for several days past;
ever since he made his public entry into Jerusalem:

teaching; the people, in a public manner:

and ye took me not; did not attempt to lay hands on him, seize him, and
carry him away; which he signifies might have been easily done; See Gill
on [Mat 26:55](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#055.md).

But the Scriptures must be fulfilled: which spoke of the betraying him
by Judas; and of their taking him in this private and secret manner; and
of the flight of the disciples from him next mentioned; See Gill on [Mat
26:56](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#056.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">mar 14:50</span></span>

And they all forsook him and fled. That is, his disciples, as the
Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic, Persic, and Ethiopic versions read; and
who seem to have transcribed it from Matthew, and lest it should be
thought, that the multitude whom Christ addressed, were intended.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">mar 14:51</span></span>

And there followed him a certain young man,.... Some think this was
John, the beloved disciple, and the youngest of the disciples; others,
that it was James, the brother of our Lord; but he does not seem to be
any of the disciples of Christ, since he is manifestly distinguished
from them, who all forsook him and fled: some have thought, that he was
a young man of the house, where Christ and his disciples ate their
passover; who had followed him to the garden, and still followed him, to
see what would be the issue of things: but it seems most likely, that he
was one that lived in an house in Gethsemane, or in or near the garden;
who being awaked out of sleep with the noise of a band of soldiers, and
others with them, leaped out of bed, and ran out in his shirt, and
followed after them, to know what was the matter:

having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; which was either his
shirt in which he lay, or one of the sheets, which he took and wrapped
himself in, not staying to put on his clothes: though the word "Sindon",
is used both by the Targumists (d) and Talmudists (e) for a linen
garment; and sometimes even for the outer garment, to which the fringes
were fastened (f); and he might take up this in haste, and slip it on,
without putting on any inner garment: the word "body", is not in the
text, and the phrase , may be rendered, "upon his nakedness"; and
answers to in [Gen 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#023.md) and [Lev
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#011.md), and the meaning be, he had only
a piece of linen wrapped about his middle, to cover his nakedness; and
in this garb ran out, to see what was doing:

and the young men laid hold on him. The Roman soldiers, who were
commonly so called: so David's soldiers are called "young men", that
were with him, [Sa1 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#004.md); these
attempted to lay hold on this young man, taking him to be a disciple of
Christ, or one at least affected to him, and did take hold of his linen
cloth. The Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic, and Persic versions, leave out
the words, "the young men". The design of Mark in relating this
incident, is to show the rage and fury of these men; who were for
sparing none that appeared to be or were thought to be the followers of
Christ; so that the preservation of the disciples was entirely owing to
the wonderful power of Christ.

And he left the linen cloth,.... "In their hands", so the Persic version
renders it; just as Joseph left his garment in the hands of his
mistress, [Gen 39:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#012.md);

and fled from them naked; to the house from whence he came. The Syriac,
Arabic, Persic, and Ethiopic versions, leave out the words "from them".

And they led Jesus away to the high priest,.... Caiaphas, as is added in
the Syriac, Arabic, and Persic versions. This was done, after they had
took Jesus and bound, him, and after they had had him to Annas, who sent
him bound to Caiaphas; see [Joh 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#012.md);

and with him, the high priest Caiaphas,

were assembled all the chief priests, and the elders, and the Scribes;
even the whole sanhedrim, who met at Caiaphas's house, and were waiting
there for Jesus; whom Judas with his band of soldiers and others, were
gone to secure, and brng before them; See Gill on [Mat

[Mark 14:54](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#054.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">mar 14:54</span></span>

And Peter followed him afar off,.... And did another disciple, perhaps
John; [Joh 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#015.md), who having somewhat
recovered themselves from their fright, turned back, and followed Jesus,
and the company that led him away; keeping at some distance, that they
might not be observed, and exposed to danger; and proceeded till they
came to Jerusalem, and to the place where the sanhedrim were convened;
and the other disciple went in along with Jesus; and Peter afterwards,
by his means, got in:

even into the palace of the high priest; being let in by her that kept
the door, at the motion of the other disciple

and he sat with the servants; as if he was one of them, and had no
concern with Jesus:

and warmed himself at the fire; or "light", as the Greek word signifies,
and answers to the Hebrew word by which both: light and fire are
expressed; of which, take an instance or two, in the room of many (g):

"a murderer that strikes, his neighbour with a stone, or with iron, and
plunges him into water, or into "fire", so that he cannot get out, and
dies, is guilty.''

Again (h), a

"book which "fire", takes hold upon on one side, he puts, water on the
other; and if it is quenched, it is quenched; if the "fire" takes hold
on both sides, he opens it, and reads in it; and if it is quenched, it
is quenched: a cloak which "fire" takes hold upon on one side, he puts
water on the other side; and if it is quenched, it is quenched; if the
"fire" takes hold on it on both sides, he takes, it and wraps himself in
it, and if it is quenched, it is quenched.''

So we read (i) of , "the fire of hell"; and Ur of the Chaldees has its
name from the fire, that was worshipped there, as a symbol of the sun:
and fire was the or "light", created on the first day, [Gen
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#003.md); See Gill on [Mat

And the chief priests, and all the council,.... Especially the former,
who were of all most busy and active in this matter:

sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; on which they were
determined, right or wrong; in this they went contrary to one of their
own canons, which runs thus (k):

"in pecuniary causes, they begin either for absolution, or condemnation;
but in capital causes, they begin for absolution, and do not begin for
condemnation.''

That is, they begun with such evidences as tended to acquit a man, and
not with such as served to condemn him; whereas this court was only
seeking for such evidence to begin with, that they might condemn Jesus
to death:

and found none; that would answer their purpose; See Gill on [Mat

For many bare false witness against him,.... The word "false", is not
expressed in the Syriac, Persic, and Ethiopic versions: which only
signify, that they bore witness against him, accused him of, and laid
many things to his charge:

but their witness agreed not together; which showed it to be false, and
so not to be admitted; for witnesses were to be as one in their
testimony, or not to be received: the, rules concerning them with the
Jews, are these (l);

"the tradition is, for ever let not their testimony be joined together,
unless they both see, "as one": says R. Joshua ben Korcha, even one
after another; and their testimony is not ratified in the council, until
they both witness "as one".''

Though this is not much the sense of the passage here; it was not the
falsehood of their testimony, which this council was unconcerned about,
or the contradiction that was in it, which does not appear; but their
testimonies were not, "equal", or answerable to the wishes of the
council; they were not sufficient to prove a capital crime upon him, in
order to, put him to death, which was what they wanted: they only
respected some light and trivial matters, and did not amount to a charge
of blasphemy, or sedition.

And there arose certain,.... Two false witnesses, as in [Mat

witnesses were obliged to stand, whilst they gave in their testimony:

they bear witness; as it is said, [Deu

We heard him say,.... In a discourse of his, recorded in [Joh
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019.md),

I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three
days I will build another made without hands; which was a very false
testimony; for Christ did not say be would destroy any temple at all,
only put the Jews on doing it; much less did he point at, or design the
temple of Jerusalem, but his own body; nor did he use the distinction of
a temple, made with and without hands; nor did he affirm that he would
build another; only said, he would raise up in three days, that which
they should destroy. By this testimony these witnesses would suggest,
that Christ had a design upon their temple to demolish it, and that he
must be a sorcerer, or a magician, to pretend to build a temple without
hands in three days time; See Gill on [Mat

But, neither so did their witness agree together. Their witness did
agree together, for they both witnessed the same thing; but not so as to
found upon it the charge of a capital crime against him; their witness
was not so, "equal", was not answerable to their desires, nor sufficient
to convict him of a capital crime, for which they could condemn him to
death, as before observed on [Mar

which he was now president: he sat at the head of them, and Ab Beth Din,
or the father of the council, at his right hand; and the rest of the
council sat before him, in a semicircular form, as the half of a round
corn floor, so that the president, and the father of the council, could
see them (n); for they were all before him, he being situated in the
middle, right against them; so that when he stood up, he might be said
to stand in the midst of them:

and asked Jesus, saying, answerest thou nothing? For he had made no
reply to the several witnesses, that came against him:

what is it which these witness against thee? Is it true, or false? See
Gill on [Mat 26:62](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#062.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_061">mar 14:61</span></span>

But he held his peace, and answered nothing,.... Knowing it would be to
no purpose, and signifying hereby, that the things alleged against him
were unworthy of an answer:

again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, art thou the Christ,
the Son of the Blessed? The Vulgate Latin adds, "God": in Matthew it is
"God" only, [Mat 26:63](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#063.md). This is one of
the names and epithets of God, with the Jews; nothing is more common in
their writings, than this abbreviature, which is, , "the holy blessed
he"; who is blessed in himself, and the fountain of all blessedness to
his creatures, and who is blessed and praised by angels and saints; See
Gill on [Mat 26:63](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#063.md).

[Mark 14:62](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#062.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_062">mar 14:62</span></span>

And Jesus said, I am,.... That is, the Son of God; in proof of which he
adds,

and ye shall see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power; that
is, of God, who is all power, the Lord God Almighty:

and coming in the clouds of heaven; either at the destruction of
Jerusalem, or at the last day, referring to the prophecy in [Dan
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013.md); See Gill on [Mat
26:64](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#064.md).

[Mark 14:63](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#063.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_063">mar 14:63</span></span>

Then the high priest rent his clothes,.... As was usual upon hearing
blasphemy; which he now supposed the case, or at least would have it so
thought:

and saith, what need we any further witnesses? or trouble ourselves to
see for any more, or to hear and take the depositions of any others; See
Gill on [Mat 26:65](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#065.md).

[Mark 14:64](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#064.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_064">mar 14:64</span></span>

Ye have heard the blasphemy,.... The "manifest" blasphemy, as the Arabic
version renders it; and "out of his own mouth", as the Syriac version
adds, agreeably to [Luk 22:71](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#071.md),

what think ye? what sentence is to, be passed upon him?

And they all condemned him to be guilty of death; excepting Joseph of
Arimathea, [Luk 23:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#051.md); See Gill on
[Mat 26:66](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#066.md).

[Mark 14:65](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#065.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_065">mar 14:65</span></span>

And some began to spit on him,.... The men that held him, [Luk
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#006.md), fulfilling the prophecy in [Isa
50:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#006.md);

and to cover his face; with a veil, or linen cloth, to blindfold: him,
as a person unworthy to behold the light: or rather, in order to make
sport with him:

and to buffet him; with their double fists;

and to say unto him, prophesy. The Arabic version adds, "unto us, O
Christ, who it is that hath buffeted thee now?" that gave thee the last
blow? and to the same purpose the Ethiopic. The Persic version adds,
"and deliver thyself";

and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands. The
Syriac version renders it, "on his cheeks": they gave him slaps on the
face. These were the officers of the high priest, that used him in this
indecent manner. This clause is omitted in the Ethiopic version.

[Mark 14:66](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#066.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_066">mar 14:66</span></span>

And as Peter was beneath in the palace,.... Not at the lower and further
end of the room, but in the lower part of it; that part in which Jesus
and the sanhedrim were, being upon an advanced ground, with steps
ascending to it:

there cometh one of the maids of the high priest; the same that kept the
door, and let him in. The Ethiopic version renders it, "a daughter of
the high priest".

[Mark 14:67](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#067.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_067">mar 14:67</span></span>

And when she saw Peter warming himself,.... At the life which was in the
midst of the hall:

she looked upon him; very earnestly, knowing him to be the same, she had
let in at the motion of one, that was known in the high priest's family;
and suspecting him, by being a stranger, and by his looks:

and said, and thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth; that is, one of his
disciples; See Gill on [Mat 26:69](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#069.md).

[Mark 14:68](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#068.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_068">mar 14:68</span></span>

But he denied,.... That he was with Jesus, or a disciple of his:

saying, I know not; Jesus of Nazareth: neither understand I what thou
sayest; about him, and of being with him: the last phrase, "neither
understand I", is omitted in the Syriac and Persic versions:

and he went out into the porch; adjoining to the palace, to consider
what to do, being surprised and confounded at such a challenge:

and the cock crew; the first time, being about midnight; and yet he took
no notice of it, nor remembered what Christ had but a few hours before
said to him: or if he did, he might hope he should not meet with another
attack, or he should have more courage and strength than to deny a
second time.

[Mark 14:69](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#069.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_069">mar 14:69</span></span>

And a maid saw him again,.... Either the same maid, so the Syriac and
Persic versions read, "that maid": that selfsame maid, as before, or
another, as in [Mat 26:71](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#071.md), and so the
Arabic version reads it here; but the Ethiopic as before "a daughter";
that is, of the high priest:

and began to say to them that stood by; the fire, along with Peter,
warming themselves:

this is one of them; this man is one of the disciples and followers of
Jesus of Nazareth; he is of that sect, he certainly belongs to them, and
is come here only as a spy.

[Mark 14:70](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#070.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_070">mar 14:70</span></span>

And he denied it again,.... That he was one of the disciples of Jesus:

and a little after; about an hour after, [Luk
22:59](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#059.md);

they that stood by, said again to Peter, surely thou art one of them;
one confidently affirmed that he was with Jesus, and another challenged
him with seeing him in the garden with him, [Luk
22:59](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#059.md), and in general they were of
opinion, that he must be one of that sect, giving this as a reason,

for thou art a Galilean: as they supposed Jesus to be; and knowing that
in Galilee he had chiefly preached, and wrought his miracles, and had
there a large number of followers:

and thy speech agreeth thereto; he used words and phrases peculiar to
the Galileans, and pronounced as they did: See Gill on [Mat
26:73](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#073.md). This clause is omitted in the
Vulgate Latin, and is wanting in Beza's most ancient copy; but is in the
other copies, and in all the eastern versions.

[Mark 14:71](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#071.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_071">mar 14:71</span></span>

But he began to curse and to swear,.... To wish the most dreadful things
upon himself, and to swear by the living God;

saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak: See Gill on [Mat
26:74](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#074.md).

[Mark 14:72](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#072.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_072">mar 14:72</span></span>

And the second time the cock crew,.... Immediately, as soon as he had so
said and swore, as the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions
read, and as it is read in one of Beza's copies; which was about three
of the clock in the morning, and is what is properly called the cock
crowing:

and Peter called to mind; upon hearing the cock crow a second time,

the word that Jesus said unto him, before the cock crow twice, thou
shalt deny me thrice: as he now had done twice, to the maid or maids,
and a third time to the servants that stood by the fire along with him:

and when he thought thereon; on the words of Christ, and on his sin in
denying him, and on the aggravated circumstances of it. The Arabic
version renders it, "he turned himself to weep"; he turned away from the
company, he threw himself out of it, and got out of doors as fast as he
could, and broke out into a violent fit of weeping. The Syriac, Persic,
and Vulgate Latin versions, render it, "he began to weep"; this phrase
is omitted in the Ethiopic version: some choose to render it, "he looked
upon him", that is, on Christ: as Christ looked upon him; which produced
true evangelical repentance in him, so Peter looked upon his dear Lord
with concern, whom he so had shamefully denied; he looked upon him and
mourned, he looked upon him with an eye of faith, and sorrowed for his
sin after a godly sort: but the true sense of the word is, "he covered
himself"; he cast his garment over his head, he veiled himself as
mourners did, who covered their heads, and their faces, and even their
lips. So Maimonides (o);

"from whence, says he, is uncovering the head, forbidden a mourner? For,
lo! it is said to [Eze 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#017.md), "cover
not thy lips" at all, for the rest of mourners are obliged to the
covering of the head; the linen cloth, or veil, with which he covers his
head, he covers with a part of it, a little over his mouth; as it is
said, [Lev 13:45](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#045.md), "He shall put a
covering upon his upper lip": and Onkelos paraphrases it, , "as a
mourner he shall cover himself".''

And so it is said of Haman (p),

"that he went to his house, and mourned for his daughter, , "and put a
covering on his head as a mourner": for his daughter, and for his
reproach.''

And this, it seems, was the custom of the Ishmaelites: hence that saying
(q),

"all veiling (in mourning) which is not as the veiling of the
Ishmaelites (who cover all the face), is no veiling?''

And thus Peter, through shame, and as a token of sorrow and mourning for
his sin, threw his garment over him:

and he wept; as Matthew says, "bitterly": being fully convinced of his
sin, and heartily sorry lot it; See Gill on [Mat
26:75](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#075.md).
