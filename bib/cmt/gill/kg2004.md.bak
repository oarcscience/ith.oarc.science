INTRODUCTION TO 2 KINGS 4

This chapter treats of the miracles of Elisha, of his multiplying a poor
widow's pot of oil for the payment of her husband's debts, [Kg2
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#001.md) of obtaining a son for a
Shunamitish woman, who had been very hospitable to him, [Kg2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#008.md), of his raising up her son to life
when dead, [Kg2 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#018.md), of his curing
the deadly pottage made of wild gourds, [Kg2
4:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#038.md), and of his feeding one hundred
men with twenty barley loaves, [Kg2
4:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#042.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 4:1</span></span>

Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets
unto Elisha,.... This, according to the Targum, was the wife of Obadiah,
who had hid the prophets by fifty in a cave in the times of Ahab; and so
Josephus (q), and it is the commonly received notion of the Jewish
writers; though it does not appear that he was a prophet, or the son of
a prophet, but the governor or steward of Ahab's house; she was more
likely to be the wife of a meaner person; and from hence it is clear
that the prophets and their disciples married:

saying, thy servant my husband is dead; which is the lot of prophets, as
well as others, [Zac 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#005.md).

and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the Lord; her husband was
well known to the prophet, and known to be a good man, one of the 7000
who bowed not the knee to Baal, for the truth of which she appeals to
Elisha; and this character she gives of her husband, lest it should be
thought that his poverty, and leaving her in debt, were owing to any ill
practices of his:

and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen;
which it seems were allowed of when men became poor and insolvent, and
died so, to which the allusion is in [Isa
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md); see Gill on [Mat
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#025). Josephus (r.md) suggests, that the
insolvency of this man was owing to his borrowing money to feed the
prophets hid in the cave; and it is a common notion of the Jews that
this creditor was Jehoram the son of Ahab; and in later times it was a
law with the Athenians (s), that if a father had not paid what he was
fined in court, the son was obliged to pay it, and in the mean while to
lie in bonds, as was the case of Cimon (t), and others.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 4:2</span></span>

And Elisha said unto her, what shall I do for thee?.... Or can I do,
being poor himself, and unable to relieve her out of his substance, and
not knowing where to get anything for her; and so what could she expect
from him? signifying, that he pitied her case, but all that he could do
was to give her his best advice, and pray for her:

tell me what thou hast in thy house? that she could part with and
dispose of, in order to pay her debt; and satisfy her creditor:

and she said, thine handmaid hath not anything in the house, save a pot
of oil; that is, nothing of any value; she might have some things, some
sort of household goods, though perhaps she had parted with most of them
in her poverty; this was the most valuable thing she had.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 4:3</span></span>

Then he said, go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours,....
For he perceived that she had none:

even empty vessels; which they might more readily lend her:

borrow not a few; but as many as she could get; the prophet, under a
divine impulse, was directed to say this to her, foreseeing, by a spirit
of prophecy, that a large quantity of oil would be given her.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 4:4</span></span>

And when thou art come in,.... Into her house:

thou shall shut the door upon thee, and upon thy sons; that they might
be alone in the house while the miracle was working; that they might not
be interrupted in what they were to do, by the creditor coming in upon
them, or by neighbours, who would be for getting the oil from them in
the vessels they had lent them: and that the miracle might appear the
plainer, no oil being brought into the house by any:

and shalt pour out into all these vessels; out of the single pot of oil
into all they borrowed:

and thou shalt set aside that which is full; by itself, and fill the
rest of the empty ones.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 4:5</span></span>

So she went from him,.... And did as he advised her, borrowed many empty
vessels of her neighbours, having faith in what the prophet had said to
her:

and shut the door upon her, and upon her sons; and then went to work as
she was directed, with her sons:

who brought the vessels to her; the empty ones she had borrowed: and she
poured out; the oil out of her pot into them.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 4:6</span></span>

And it came to pass when the vessels were full,.... For the oil being
miraculously increased as it was poured forth, there was enough to fill
all the vessels; Ben Gersom and Abarbinel say, that when the pot was
emptied, all the air that entered it was turned into oil:

that she said to her son, bring me yet a vessel; as she had two sons,
one it is probable was employed in setting aside the full vessels, as
she poured into them, and the other in bringing to her the empty
vessels, and to whom she thus speaks:

and he said unto her, there is not a vessel more; not an empty one, they
were all filled:

and the oil stayed; it ran no longer, it was no more multiplied; there
was no necessity of continuing the miracle: this oil may be an emblem of
the grace that flows from the fulness of it in Christ, to which it is
compared, which will be always flowing, as long as there is a vessel of
salvation, or faith in any to receive it; see [Mat
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#003.md) [Jo1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#020.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 4:7</span></span>

Then she came and told the man of God,.... Elisha the prophet, what had
been done, what a quantity of oil she had, and advised with him what was
to be done with it:

and he said, go, sell thy oil, and pay thy debt; what was thus
miraculously produced was no doubt very good and excellent, and would
fetch a good price; and she is therefore bid to turn it into money, and
pay her debts with it; she was not to keep it all for her own use, and
indulge to luxury with it, but first pay her just debt, as everyone
ought to do that is able:

and live thou and thy children of the rest; so that it seems there was
enough to pay her debt with it, rid her of her troubles, and somewhat
remaining for the support of herself and children.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 4:8</span></span>

And it fell on a day,.... Or so it was at a certain time:

that Elisha passed to Shunem; a city in the tribe of Issachar; of which
see [Jos 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#018.md),

where was a great woman; of great wealth and riches, of great
benevolence and hospitality, and of great grace and piety; that feared
sin, as the Targum paraphrases it; a woman of great credit and
reputation on all accounts. The Jews say (u) she was the sister of
Abishag the Shunammite, and the mother of Iddo the prophet:

and she constrained him to eat bread; she had observed him at all times
pass that way, and guessed by his habit and deportment that he was a
religious man, and therefore took an opportunity to invite him into her
house, and take a dinner with her; but he being modest and shy, she was
obliged to use some pressing language, and be importunate with him, that
he would accept of her invitation, which he did:

and so it was, that, as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat
bread; being made very welcome, and encouraged by the free and kind
entertainment he met with, as often as he had occasion to come that way,
he called and took a meal with her; and this it seems was pretty often,
for Shunem was not far from Carmel, which he frequented, and lay in the
way to Samaria, Bethel, and Jericho, places he often visited, the
schools of the prophets being there.

\(u\) T. Bab. Bava Bathra, fol. 57. 2.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 4:9</span></span>

And she said unto her husband,.... Not being willing to do any thing
without his leave and consent:

behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God which passeth by
us continually: and calls here frequently: this she perceived by his
discourse and conversation; and by his carriage and behaviour he
appeared to be a prophet, and one very eminent for holiness and
religion.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 4:10</span></span>

Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall,.... Either of
the city, to which their house might join, or of their garden, a little
distance from the house; though the Jewish writers commonly understand
it of a little edifice built up of walls of stone or bricks, and not one
with reeds, or stud and mud:

let us set for him there a bed; that he may stay all night when he
pleases:

and a table; not only to eat his food, but to write on, and lay his
books on he reads. Of the table of a scholar of the wise men, in later
times, we are told (t), that two thirds of it were covered with a cloth,
and the other third was uncovered, on which stood the plates and the
herbs:

and a stool; to sit upon at table:

and a candlestick; with a candle in it, to light him in the night to
read by, and the like:

and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither;
where he would be free from the noise of the house, and be more retired
for prayer, reading, meditation, and study, and not be disturbed with
the servants of the family, and be mixed with them; all this she
contrived, both for his honour, and for his quietness and peace.

\(t\) Pirke Eliezer, c. 33.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 4:11</span></span>

And it fell on a day that he came thither,.... As he had been wont to
do:

and he turned into the chamber; built for him, and to which he was
directed:

and lay there; all night, and which no doubt was frequently repeated by
him, he accepting of the kindness of his host.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 4:12</span></span>

And he said to Gehazi his servant,.... Who attended him wherever he
went, and ministered to him, and lay very probably in the same chamber
with him; he might be one of the sons of the prophets:

call this Shunammite; tell her I desire to speak with her:

and when he had called her, she stood before him; at the door of the
chamber, in great reverence of him, and with much humility, waiting to
hear what he had to say to her: this must be understood after what had
further passed between Elisha and Gehazi, and between Gehazi and the
woman, who returned to his master, and acquainted him with what she had
said to him, upon which he was sent to call her, and she came.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 4:13</span></span>

And he said unto him,...., To Gehazi, before he went to call her:

say now unto her, behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this
care; in building a chamber, and furnishing it with proper household
goods, and providing food for them from time to time:

what is to be done for thee? can anything be thought of by thee that
will be acceptable, and in my masters power to do for thee, or thy
husband?

wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host?
that her husband might be promoted to some post in the court, or in the
camp; intimating, that if either of these was agreeable, Elisha would
speak on his behalf, having interest in both through his services in
Edom:

and she answered, I will dwell among my own people she was content and
satisfied with her present state of life, and the situation she was in,
and with her friends and neighbours she lived among, and did not care to
remove, though it was to a higher rank of life, and to greater dignity
and honour; and she had no suit to make to the king or general, nothing
to complain of; and she had friends enough to speak for her, should she
want any assistance.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 4:14</span></span>

And he said,.... That is, Elisha to Gehazi, when he returned to him, and
told him what the Shunammite said:

what then is to be done for her? something he thought should be done in
gratitude, the favours they had received, and advises with his servant
what could be thought of, he being one about the house:

and Gehazi answered, verily she hath no child, and her husband is old;
and so not likely to have any by him; as children were always very
desirable by women, and especially in those days, the servant suggests,
that no doubt to have one would be very acceptable to her.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 4:15</span></span>

And he said, call her,.... Perhaps finding an impulse on his own mind,
from the Spirit of God, that this was the thing to be done for her:

and when he had called her, she stood in the door; of his chamber: See
Gill on [Kg2 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#012.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 4:16</span></span>

And he said, about this season,.... In the next year:

according to the time of life; the usual time women go with child:

thou shalt embrace a son; in thine arms, that shall be born of thee,
which she should have in her lap, and in her bosom:

and she said, nay, my lord, do not lie unto thine handmaid; or speak
unto her what was not truth; it was so great, and so unaccountable, how
it could be in her circumstances, that she could not believe it to be
true, though she wished it might; or do not deceive me with vain and
false words, or flatter me, jest with me, which would be unbecoming his
character as a man of God, and prophet of the Lord; according to the
Targum, she wished it might prove true, and she not deceived; see [Kg2
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#028.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 4:17</span></span>

And the woman conceived, and bare a son at the season that Elisha said
unto her,.... Quickly after this she conceived, and became pregnant, and
by that time the year came round, she was brought to bed of a son:

according to the time of life: when she had gone her full time to have a
son born alive, and live.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 4:18</span></span>

And when the child was grown,.... Perhaps was six or seven years of age,
or more:

it fell on a day that he went out to his father to the reapers; it was
harvest time, and the men were reaping the corn in the fields; and his
father, though a wealthy man, was with them to direct them, and see they
did their business well, as Boaz formerly; and the child went out from
the house to the field, to see his father and the reapers, for his
recreation and diversion.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 4:19</span></span>

And he said unto his father, my head, my head,.... After he had been
some time with him, he complained of a pain in his head, which might be
owing, as Abarbinel thinks, to the sun's beating upon it, being harvest
time, and hot weather; and the pain being exceeding great and vehement,
he repeated his complaint, see [Jer
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#019.md).

and he said to a lad, carry him home to his mother; his father gave
orders to a lad that attended the reapers to have him home to his
mother, that she might give him something to ease him of his pain.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 4:20</span></span>

And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother,.... The lad
led him home, and delivered him to his mother:

he sat on her knees till noon, and then died; out of her great
affection, she took him on her knees, and laid his head in her bosom to
sooth the pain, and in this posture he continued until the middle of the
day, and then expired; by which it appears it was in the morning when he
went into the field, and when the sun was pretty high, and beat strongly
on him; which, it may be, produced a fever, and which issued in his
death.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 4:21</span></span>

And she went up,.... Into the little chamber built for the prophet:

and laid him on the bed of the man of God; not from any imagination of
any virtue in it to bring her child to life; though she might think of
the prophet, and have faith that he could raise it to life, as Elijah
raised the widow of Zarephath's son laid on his bed, of which she might
have heard; but this being a private room, and into which none went, she
laid it here to conceal its death from her husband and family, and to
prevent grief, and that they might not bury it until she returned:

and shut the door upon him; that no creature might enter, and, do any
damage to his corpse:

and went out; not out of the chamber, that she did before she shut the
door, but out of the house.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg2 4:22</span></span>

And she called unto her husband,.... In the field, who might be within
call, or by a messenger she sent to him:

and said, send me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and one of the
asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again; intimating that
she should not be long gone, but should return again presently; saying
not a word of the death of the child, or of the occasion of her going.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 4:23</span></span>

And he said, wherefore wilt thou go to him today?.... What reason is
there for it? what is the meaning of it?

it is neither new moon nor sabbath; neither the first day of the month,
nor the seventh day of the week, times which were religiously observed;
so with the Heathens the new moon and the seventh of the week, and so
the fourth, were sacred (u); which notions they borrowed from the Jews;
see Gill on [Sa1 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#005.md) and when, it
seems, it was usual to frequent the house of the prophet, to hear the
word of God read and explained, and other religious exercises performed,
as praying and singing praise, and receiving some good instructions and
advice. Joseph Kimchi gives a different sense of these words:"there is
not a month past, no, not a week, since thou sawest him;''why therefore
shouldest thou be in such haste to go to him? so the words for new moon
and sabbath may signify:

and she said, it shall be well; it was right for her to go, and it would
be well for him and her, and the family; or, "peace" (w), be easy and
quiet, farewell: it is much he had no mistrust of the death of the
child, or that it was worse, since it went from him ill.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg2 4:24</span></span>

Then she saddled an ass,.... Her servant did it by her order:

and said to her servant, drive, and go forward; make all the haste he
could:

slack not thy riding for me, except I bid thee; do not be afraid of
riding too fast for me; if thou dost, I will tell thee; till then, keep
on a good pace: Abarbinel says she walked afoot all the way, and ordered
the man not to slacken his pace in riding for her, unless she called to
him; and the Targum seems to favour this sense,"do not press me to ride
unless I call to thee;''so that the ass was for Elijah to ride on; but
one would think, that, as she was in haste, quicker dispatch would be
made by her riding than by walking, see [Kg2
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#022.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 4:25</span></span>

So she went and came unto the man of God at Mount Carmel,.... Where
Elijah used to be, and where, perhaps, was a school of the prophets;
this, according to Bunting (x), was sixteen miles from Shunem:

and it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off; as he might
from the eminence of the mountain:

that he said to Gehazi his servant, behold, yonder is that Shunammite;
that has so often and so hospitably entertained us at her house.

\(x\) Travels, &c. p. 207.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg2 4:26</span></span>

Run now, I pray thee, to meet her,.... In respect to her, and to know
the occasion of her coming; something is the cause of it:

and say unto her, is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is
it well with the child? has any disaster befallen thee, thy husband, or
the child? are all in good health? or does any disorder attend any of
them?

and she answered, it is well; as in general they were, the greatest
part, she and her husband; and though the child was dead, yet, if gone
to heaven, as she might hope, it was well too; and it is right to judge
and say, that all that the Lord does is well: she gives a short answer
to the servant, not being willing to be detained, and being desirous of
telling her case to the prophet himself.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 4:27</span></span>

And when she came to the man of God to the hill,.... To the top of it:

she caught him by the feet; in reverence to him, and as a supplicant,
she prostrated herself at his feet, and, out of affection to him, caught
hold on them, and held them fast, and determined not to leave him until
he had promised to go with her, see [Mat
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#009.md). It was usual with the Jews to
lay hold on and kiss the feet or knees of those to whom they did homage,
or made supplication, see [Mat 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#009.md).
See Gill on [Luk 7:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#038.md), and so with the
Greeks, as may be observed in various passages in Homer (y) and others:

but Gehazi came near to thrust her away; as being troublesome and
disagreeable to his master, and not for her honour and credit:

and the man of God said, let her alone, for her soul is vexed within
her; or "is bitter" (z), full of trouble and distress, and knows not
what to do, nor very well what she does:

and the Lord hath hid it from me, and hath not told me: what is the
cause of this her trouble; for prophets did not know things of
themselves, nor had they the vision of prophecy at their will and
pleasure, but according to the will of God.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg2 4:28</span></span>

Then she said, did I desire a son of my lord?.... It was not at her
request she had one, at least the first motion was not from her; the
prophet first told her, and assured her she should have one, without her
asking for it; she might be pleased with it, and desire the promise
might be fulfilled; but it was not an inordinate, importunate, desire of
one, in which she had exceeded, that so the taking it away from her
might be a correction of her for it:

did I not say, do not deceive me; by giving hopes of a child, and yet
have none; and now it was equally the same, or worse, to have one, and
then to have it taken away again as soon as had almost; so the
Targum,"did I not say unto thee, if a child is given me, let it live, if
not, do not trouble or grieve me;''and then, no doubt, she told him
plainly the child was dead, and where she had laid it, though not
recorded.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg2 4:29</span></span>

Then he said to Gehazi, gird up thy loins,.... His loose and long
garments about him, that he might make quicker dispatch in travelling:

and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way; not for the sake of
travelling with it, but for an end after mentioned:

if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him
not again; that so no time may be lost:

and lay my staff upon the face of the child; he not intending when he
said this to go himself, but at the time, as near as he could, when this
action was performed, would pray to God to restore life to the child;
for he could not imagine that by this bare action it could be done.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg2 4:30</span></span>

And the mother of the child said,.... Having no faith in what the
servant was to do, or could do:

as the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee;
signifying she would not go with his servant, but insisted upon it that
he himself went with her, or she would not depart:

and he arose, and followed her; influenced by her importunity, and a
sense of favours he had received from her, and more especially by the
Spirit of God.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg2 4:31</span></span>

And Gehazi passed on before them,.... The prophet and the Shunammite:

and laid the staff upon the face of the child; as he was ordered:

but there was neither voice nor hearing: it seems as if he spoke when he
laid the staff on the child, but it heard and answered him not, so that
there was no sign of life in it:

wherefore he went again to meet him; upon the road between Carmel and
Shunem:

and told him, saying, the child is not awaked; by which he expresses its
being dead; or, if he knew nothing of its death, he supposed it fast
asleep, which was the reason of its not hearing and answering, though
the former seems best.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg2 4:32</span></span>

And when Elisha was come into the house,.... Of the Shunamite, and into
the chamber built for him:

behold, the child was dead, and laid upon the bed; upon his bed, and
where he found it really dead.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg2 4:33</span></span>

He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain,.... Himself and
the dead child; that nobody might come in and interrupt him in his
prayers for the restoration of it to life, nor see the motions and
gestures he used, and the postures he put himself in:

and prayed unto the Lord; that he would restore the child to life.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg2 4:34</span></span>

And he went up,.... To the bed, which was on an ascent in the chamber;
see Gill on [Kg2 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#004.md) and lay upon the
child; as Elijah did on the widow's son of Zarephath, [Kg1
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#021.md).

and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his
hands upon his hands, and stretched himself upon the child; that is, he
did each of these one after another, since the disproportion of their
bodies would not admit of their being done together:

and the flesh of the child waxed warm; not from any virtue imparted to
it by these motions and actions of the prophet, but from life being
infused into it by the Lord, which caused an heat in the several parts
of the body.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">kg2 4:35</span></span>

Then he returned and walked in the house to and fro,.... Left the
chamber, and came down to the house where the family chiefly resided,
and walked to and fro in deep thought and meditation, and, no doubt, in
fervent ejaculations for the wished for blessing to be completed:

and went up; to the chamber again, and up to the bed in it:

and stretched himself upon him; as before:

and the child sneezed seven times; which was a sign of life, and even of
health; and hereby his head was cleared, as some observe, of those
humours that had caused the pains in it (a), and had issued in death:

and the child opened his eyes; upon the prophet, another sign of life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">kg2 4:36</span></span>

And he called Gehazi, and said, call this Shunammite,.... To come up to
the chamber to him:

so he called her: and when she was come in unto him, he said, take up
thy son; from off the bed, alive, safe, and sound.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">kg2 4:37</span></span>

Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the
ground,.... In reverence of him, and with the most profound gratitude
and thankfulness for the mercy received:

and took up her son, and went out; of the chamber into her house, with
great joy and gladness.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">kg2 4:38</span></span>

And Elisha came again to Gilgal,.... Where he was with Elijah a little
before his assumption to heaven, [Kg2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#001.md) and whither he went, there being a
school of the prophets, as he did to all places where there were any,
and where he had been before with Elijah; partly to instruct, encourage,
and strengthen them, and partly to confirm his office as a prophet by
miracles, which he did in several places he came to:

and there was a dearth in the land; a famine through drought:

and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him: as disciples
before their master, see [Act 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#003.md).

and he said unto his servant; very probably Gehazi:

set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets;
who seemed to have lived together in one house or college, and to be to
the number of one hundred, see [Kg2
4:43](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#043.md) and therefore required to have a
large pot set on to boil pottage for them all.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">kg2 4:39</span></span>

And one went out into the fields to gather herbs,.... To put into the
pottage, the gardens affording none in this time of dearth; or, however,
being scarce, were at too great a price for the sons of the prophets to
purchase them; and therefore one of them went out into the field to
gather what common herbs he could:

and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full;
thought to be the same with coloquintida, the leaves of which are very
like to a vine, of a very bitter taste, and a very violent purgative,
which, if not remedied, will produce ulcerations in the bowels, and
issue in death; some think the white brier or white vine is meant, the
colour of whose berries is very inviting to look at, but very bitter and
ungrateful, and it vehemently purges (b); the Arabs call a sort of
mushroom that is white and soft by this name (c), but cannot be meant
here, because it has no likeness to a wild vine:

and came and shred them into the pot of pottage; cut or chopped them
small, and put them into the pot:

for they knew them not; what they were, the nature and virtue of them,
being unskilful in botany.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">kg2 4:40</span></span>

So they poured out for the men to eat,.... When the pottage was boiled,
they poured it out into dishes or basins, for the sons of the prophets
to eat:

and it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried
out, and said, O thou man of God, there is death in the pot; poison, the
cause of death; the pottage was so exceeding bitter, that they concluded
there must be some poisonous herb in it; and coloquintida is so bitter,
that it is called "the gall of the earth":

and they could not eat thereof: they stopped eating, it being so very
disagreeable, and, as they supposed, dangerous.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">kg2 4:41</span></span>

But he said, then bring meal: and he cast it into the pot,.... And
stirred it about in it:

and he said, pour out for the people, that they may eat; as they now
might freely, and without any danger, as he intimated:

and there was no harm in the pot; or anything that could do any harm or
mischief to the health of men: this was not owing to the natural virtue
of meal, but to a miraculous power attending it, whereby the pottage was
cured of its malignity, as the bad waters of Jericho were by salt, in a
preceding miracle.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">kg2 4:42</span></span>

And there came a man from Baalshalisha,.... Of which place See Gill on
[Sa1 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#004.md), the Targum is, from the
south country:

and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of
barley; so that it was now barley harvest, and this the first fruits of
it, which, according to the law, [Lev
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#010.md), was to be brought to the
priest; but being forbid in the land of Israel going up to Jerusalem,
religious men brought their firstfruits to the prophets, and here to
Elisha, the father of them; believing it would be dispensed with, and
acceptable, since they were not allowed to carry them to the proper
person; and in this time of famine was very agreeable to the man of God,
supposing it only a present:

and full ears of corn in the husk thereof; these were green ears of
corn, which they used to parch; but might not be eaten until the
firstfruits were offered, and then they might, [Lev
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#014.md), the Targum renders it, "in his
garment", in the skirt of his clothes; and to the same purpose are the
Syriac and Arabic versions; and so Jarchi interprets it; and Ben Gersom
says, it signifies some vessel in which he brought them:

and he said, give unto the people, that they may eat; Elisha did not
reserve this offering or present for himself, but, as he had freely
received, he freely gave.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:43](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">kg2 4:43</span></span>

And his servitor said,.... His servant Gehazi very probably:

what, should I set this before one hundred men? for so many, it seems,
the sons of the prophets were in this place; and these loaves being very
small, no more, it is thought by some, than one man could eat, and the
ears of corn but few, the servant suggests they would be nothing
comparatively to such a company of men:

he said again, give the people, that they may eat; he insisted upon it
that his orders should be obeyed:

for thus saith the Lord, they shall eat, and shall leave thereof; it was
suggested to him by a spirit of prophecy, there would be enough for
them, and to spare.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:44](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">kg2 4:44</span></span>

So he set it before them,.... The twenty barley loaves, and the full
ears of corn:

and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of the Lord;
as the disciples did at the miracle of the loaves and fishes; though
that must be allowed to be a greater miracle than this, [Mat
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#017.md).
