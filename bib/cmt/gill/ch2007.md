### [2 Chronicles Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 7:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO 2 CHRONICLES 7

In this chapter is an account of the Lord's acceptance of the sacrifices
offered at the dedication of the temple by fire, to the great surprise
and encouragement of the people, [Ch2
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#001.md), and of the feast kept on that
account, and the feast of tabernacles, [Ch2
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#008.md), and of the Lord's appearance to
Solomon, giving an answer to his prayer, [Ch2
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#013.md).

[2 Chronicles 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 7:1</span></span>

Now when Solomon had made an end of praying,.... The prayer recorded in
the preceding chapter:

the fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the
sacrifices; which was the token God gave of his acceptance of them, of
which there had been several instances before, [Lev
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#024.md), [Kg1
18:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#038.md),

and the glory of the Lord filled the house; the glory of the Shechinah
of the Lord, as the Targum, see [Kg1
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#011.md).

[2 Chronicles 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 7:2</span></span>

And the priests could not enter into the house of the Lord,.... They
went in to carry the ark thither, but not being able to stand to
minister, they came out, and could not reenter:

because the glory of the Lord had filled the Lord's house; both the holy
place, and the holy of holies, see [Kg1
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#010.md).

[2 Chronicles 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 7:3</span></span>

And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down,.... From
heaven upon the sacrifice, and consumed it, which was all visible to the
eye; or it may be this was a distinct fire from the former, since it
seems to have come down upon the house, and so may denote a bright,
shining, glorious light; the same with what follows:

and the glory of the Lord upon the house; for not only the house was
filled with the glory, but there was a bright stream of light and glory
over it, very dazzling and surprising:

they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement;
of the great court, where they were assembled:

and worshipped and praised the Lord: worshipped him by praising him:

saying, for he is good; in his nature, promises, and blessings; is good,
and does good:

for his mercy endureth for ever; this was the close of their song of
praise.

[2 Chronicles 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 7:4</span></span>

Then the king and all the people,.... Of these two verses; see Gill on
[Kg1 8:62](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#062.md); see Gill on [Kg1
8:63](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#063.md).

[2 Chronicles 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 7:6</span></span>

And the priests waited on their offices,.... Performed them, some in
offering sacrifices, others in blowing trumpets, as it may be explained
from the latter part of the verse:

the Levites also with instruments of music of the Lord, which David the
king had made to praise the Lord; under a divine direction, on which the
Levites played to the songs of praise offered to the Lord, and by which
they made music sacred to him:

because his mercy endureth for ever; which, as it was the close of their
songs of praise, was the cause of them:

when David praised by their ministry; the songs sung being composed by
him, and the instruments they played upon being of his invention, and
used by his order:

and the priests sounded trumpets before them; or rather over against
them, that is, over against the Levites, as they were singing and
playing on the instruments of music:

and all Israel stood; while this sacred and delightful service was
performing, they both stood up, and stood by the priests and Levites,
and joined with them in praising the Lord.

[2 Chronicles 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 7:7</span></span>

Moreover, Solomon hallowed the middle of the court,.... From hence, to
the end of [Ch2 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#010.md) is the same with
[Kg1 8:64](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#064.md). See Gill on [Kg1
8:64](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#064.md), [Kg1
8:65](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#065.md), [Kg1
8:66](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#066.md), only mention is made in [Ch2
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#009.md) of the dedication of the altar, as
if distinct from the dedication of the house, and hallowing the middle
of the court, see [Num 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#010.md) in
imitation of which the Heathens dedicated their altars, in which they
used ashes and water, as Pausanias (y) relates, and had also feasts, as
here, at the dedication of their temples (z), in which they have been
imitated by Christians; and many of our country feasts, as they are
called, were first kept at the dedication of churches to such and such a
saint.

\(y\) Eliac, 1. sive, l. 5. p. 312. (z) Plin. Ep. l. 4. ep. 1.

[2 Chronicles 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 7:11</span></span>

Thus Solomon finished the house of the Lord,.... With which begins [Kg1
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#001.md); see Gill on [Kg1
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#001.md).

[2 Chronicles 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 7:12</span></span>

And the Lord appeared to Solomon by night,.... From hence, to the end of
the chapter, much the same things are related as in [Kg1
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#002.md). See Gill on [Kg1
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#002.md), [Kg1
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#003.md), [Kg1
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#004.md), [Kg1
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#005.md), [Kg1
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#006.md), [Kg1
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#007.md), [Kg1
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#008.md), [Kg1
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#009.md), excepting [Ch2
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#013.md) which contain an answer to the
particular requests made by Solomon in case of a famine or pestilence,
that when the people of Israel should humble themselves in prayer and
supplication, the Lord would be attentive to them, and forgive them,
[Ch2 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#026.md) and which is given as a
specimen, and as encouragement to expect the same treatment in all other
cases mentioned in Solomon's prayer, they so behaving.
