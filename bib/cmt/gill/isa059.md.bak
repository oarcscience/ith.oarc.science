### [Isaiah Chapter 59](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

INTRODUCTION TO ISAIAH 59

As the former chapter declares the hypocrisy and formality of professors
of religion; this expresses the errors and heresies, immorality and
profaneness, which shall prevail before the spiritual reign of Christ,
or the latter day glory begins; which is so fully described in the next
chapter. Reasons are given of God's withdrawing his presence from a
professing people, which were not want of power and readiness in him,
but their own sins and transgressions, [Isa
59:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#001.md) which are enumerated, such as
murder, rapine, lies, &c. [Isa 59:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#003.md)
for which the judgments of God were upon them, darkness, distress, and
misery, of which they were sensible, [Isa
59:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#009.md) and confess their sins and
transgressions, [Isa 59:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#012.md) and lament
their wretched state and condition, which was displeasing to God, [Isa
59:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#014.md) who is represented as appearing
for their salvation; moved to it by their want of help, and the
oppression of their enemies, in which he shows his power, justice, zeal,
grace, and goodness, [Isa 59:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#016.md) the
consequence of which shall be the conversion and salvation of many,
owing to the efficacy of the divine Spirit, and to the spiritual coming
of the Redeemer, [Isa 59:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#019.md), and the
chapter is closed with a promise of the continuance of the Spirit of
God, and the Gospel of Christ in his church, unto the end of the world,
[Isa 59:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#021.md).

[Isaiah 59:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 59:1</span></span>

Behold, the Lord's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save,.... It is
not for want of power in the Lord, that he has not as yet destroyed the
enemies of his people, antichrist, and the antichristian states, and
saved them out of their hands, and made them to triumph over them; or
brought on the glorious state of the church, and fulfilled the promises
of good things, suggested in the latter part of the preceding chapter.
His hand is as long as ever, and as able to reach his and their enemies
in the greatest height of power, or at the greatest distance, and to do
every good thing for them; his power is as great as ever, and not in the
least abridged or curtailed.

Neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear: the prayers of his people,
their cries unto him on their fast days, of which he seemed to take no
notice, complained of [Isa 58:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#003.md), this
is not owing to any want of attention in him, or of readiness to hear
prayer made unto him; for he is a God hearing and answering prayer, and
is ready to help his people in every time of need, who apply to him in a
proper and suitable manner; his eyes are upon them, and his ears are
open to their cries. And this is introduced with a "behold", as
requiring attention, and deserving the notice and consideration of his
people. The Targum is,

"behold, not through defect of hand (or power) from the Lord ye are not
saved; nor because it is heavy to him to hear, that your prayer is not
received.''

[Isaiah 59:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 59:2</span></span>

Like a partition wall dividing between them, so that they enjoy no
communion with him in his worship and ordinances; which is greatly the
case of the reformed churches: they profess the true God, and the
worship of him, and do attend the outward ordinances of it; but this is
done in such a cold formal way, and such sins and wickedness are
perpetrated and connived at, that the Lord does not grant his gracious
presence to them, but stands at a distance from them:

and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear; or have
caused him to hide himself; withdraw his gracious presence; neglect the
prayers put up to him; deny an answer to them; or, however, not appear
as yet for the deliverance and salvation of them, and bringing them into
a more comfortable, prosperous, and happy condition.

[Isaiah 59:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 59:3</span></span>

For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with
iniquity,.... From a general charge, the prophet proceeds to a
particular enumeration of sins they were guilty of; and idolatry not
being mentioned, as Jerom observes, shows that the prophecy belongs to
other times than Isaiah's, when that sin greatly prevailed. He begins
the account with the sin of shedding blood; the blood of innocents, as
the Targum; designing either the sin of murder, now frequently committed
in Christian nations; or wars between Christian princes, by means of
which much blood is shed; or persecutions of Christian brethren, by
casting them into prisons, which have issued in their death; and at
least want of brotherly love, or, the hatred of brethren, which is
called murder, [Jo1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#015.md) a prevailing
sin in the present Sardian state; and which will not be removed till the
spiritual reign or Philadelphian state takes place: and this sin is of a
defiling nature; it "defiles" the "hands" or actions; and without love
all works signify nothing, [Co1 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#001.md),
yea, even their "fingers" are said to be defiled "with iniquity";
meaning either their lesser actions; or rather those more curiously and
nicely performed, and seemingly more agreeable to the divine will; and
yet defiled with some sin or other, as hypocrisy, vain glory, or the
like: or it may be this may design the same as putting forth the
fingers, and smiting with the fist, [Isa
58:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#004.md), as Kimchi and Ben Melech
observe; and so may have respect to some sort of persecution of their
brethren for conscience sake, as there.

Your lips have spoken lies: or "falsehood" (q); that is, false
doctrines, so called because contrary to the word of truth, and which
deceive men:

your tongue hath muttered perverseness: that which is a perversion of
the Gospel of Christ, and of the souls of men; what is contrary to the
sacred Scriptures, the standard of faith and practice, and that
premeditated, as the word (r) signifies; done with design, and on
purpose: the abounding of errors and heresies in the present day, openly
taught and divulged, to the ruin of souls, seems here to be pointed at.
In the Talmud (s) these are explained of the several sorts of men in a
court of judicature; the "hands" of the judges; the "fingers" of, the
Scribes; the "lips" of advocates and solicitors; and the "tongue" of
adversaries, or the contending parties.

[Isaiah 59:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 59:4</span></span>

None calleth for justice,.... Or, "righteousness"; not for civil justice
in courts of judicature, as if there were no advocates for it there; or
that put those in mind of it, to whom the administration of it belongs;
or that see to put the laws against sin in execution, and to relieve
those that are oppressed; though of this there may be just cause of
complaint in some places: but there are none or few that call for
evangelical righteousness, either that preach it, proclaim and publish
it to others; even the righteousness of Christ, the grand doctrine of
the Gospel, which is therein revealed from faith to faith; so the Syriac
version, "there is none that preacheth righteously"; or "in", or "of
righteousness" (t); and the Septuagint version, "no one speaks righteous
things"; the words and doctrines of righteousness and truth: or, "no one
calls for righteousness"; desires to hear this doctrine, and have it
preached to him; hungers and thirsts after it; but chooses the doctrine
of justification by works. The Targum refers it to prayer, paraphrasing
it thus,

"there is none that prays in truth;''

in sincerity and uprightness, in faith and with fervour; but in a cold,
formal, and hypocritical way:

nor any pleadeth for truth: for the truth of the Gospel, particularly
for the principal one, the justification of a sinner by the
righteousness of Christ alone; few or none contend earnestly for the
faith once delivered to the saints; they are not valiant for the truth,
nor stand fast in it, but drop or conceal it, or deny it: or, "none is
judged by", or "according to truth" (u); by the Scriptures of truth, but
by carnal reason; or by forms and rules of man's devising, and so are
condemned; as Gospel ministers and professors of it are:

they trust in vanity; in nothing, as the Vulgate Latin; that is worth
nothing; in their own strength, wisdom, riches, righteousness,
especially the latter:

and speak lies; or "vanity"; vain things, false doctrines, as before:

they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity; they "conceive" and
contrive "mischief" in their minds against those that differ in doctrine
and practice from them: "and bring forth iniquity": do that which is
criminal and sinful, by words and actions, by calumnies and reproaches,
by violence and persecution. The Targum is,

"they hasten and bring out of their hearts words of violence.''

\(t\) "in justitia", Montanus, Tigurine version; "sive de justitia". (u)
"nemo judicatur scundum veritatem", Munster; "non judicatur in
veritate", Montanus.

[Isaiah 59:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 59:5</span></span>

They hatch cockatrice eggs, and weave the spider's web,.... Invent false
doctrines according to their own fancies, which may seem fair and
plausible, but are poisonous and pernicious; as the "eggs of the
cockatrice", which may look like, and may be taken for, the eggs of
creatures fit to eat; and spin out of their brains a fine scheme of
things, but which are as thin, and as useless, and unprofitable, as "the
spider's web"; and serve only to ensnare and entangle the minds of men,
and will not stand before the word of God which sweeps them away at
once; particularly of this kind is the doctrine of justification by the
works of men, which are like the spider's web, spun out of its own
bowels; so these are from themselves, as the doctrine of them is a
device of man, and is not of God:

he that eateth of their eggs dieth: as a man that eats of cockatrice
eggs dies immediately, being rank poison; so he that approves of false
doctrines, receives them, and feeds upon them, dies spiritually and
eternally; these are damnable doctrines, which bring upon men swift
destruction; they are poisonous, and eat as do a canker, and destroy the
souls of men:

and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper; or "cockatrice"; so
Kimchi and Ben Melech take it to be the same creature as before, which
goes by different names; and the words seem to require this sense;
however, it cannot be the creature we call the viper, since that is not
oviparous, but viviparous, lays not eggs, but brings forth its young;
though both Aristotle (w) and Pliny (x), at the same time they say it is
viviparous, yet observe that it breeds eggs within itself, which are of
one colour, and soft like fishes. The Targum renders it "flying
serpents": the sense is, that if a man is cautious, and does not eat of
the cockatrice eggs, but sets his foot on them, and crushes them, out
comes the venomous creature, and he is in danger of being hurt by it; so
a man that does not embrace false doctrines, and escapes eternal death
by them, but tramples upon them, opposes them, and endeavours to crush
and destroy them, yet he is exposed to and brings upon himself
calumnies, reproach, and persecution.

[Isaiah 59:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 59:6</span></span>

Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover
themselves with their works,.... As spiders' webs are not fit to make
garments of, are too thin to cover naked bodies, or shelter from bad
weather, or injuries from different causes; so neither the false
doctrines of men will be of any use to themselves, or to others that
receive them; particularly the doctrine of justification by works: these
are not proper garments to cover the nakedness of a sinner from the
sight of God, or screen him from avenging justice; but his hope which is
placed on them will be cut off, and his trust in them will be a spider's
web, of no avail to him, [Job 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#014.md),

their works are works of iniquity: both of preacher and hearer; even
their best works are sinful; not only as being imperfect, and having a
mixture of sin in them, and so filthy rags, and insufficient to justify
them before God; but because done from wrong principles, and with wrong
views, and tending to set aside the justifying righteousness of Christ,
and God's way of justifying sinners by it, which is abominable to him:

and the act of violence is in their hands; they persecuting such that
preach and profess the contrary doctrine.

[Isaiah 59:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 59:7</span></span>

Their feet run to evil,.... Make haste to commit all manner of sin, and
particularly that which follows, with great eagerness and swiftness,
taking delight and pleasure therein, and continuing in it; it is their
course of life. The words seem to be taken out of [Pro
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#016.md) and are quoted with the following
by the Apostle Paul, [Rom 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#015.md) to
prove the general corruption of mankind:

and they make haste to shed innocent blood: in wars abroad or at home,
in quarrels and riots, or through the heat of persecution; which if it
does not directly touch men's lives, yet issues in the death of many
that fall under the power of it; and which persecutors are very eager
and hasty in the prosecution of. The phrase fitly describes their temper
and conduct:

their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity: their thoughts are continually
devising things vain and sinful in themselves, unprofitable to them, and
pernicious to others: their thoughts, words, and actions being evil;
their tongue, lips, hands, and feet being employed in sin, show their
general depravity:

wasting and destruction are in their paths: they waste and destroy all
they meet with in their ways, their fellow creatures and their
substance; and the ways they walk in lead to ruin and destruction, which
will be their portion for evermore.

[Isaiah 59:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 59:8</span></span>

The way of peace they know not,.... Neither the way of peace with God,
supposing it is to be made by man, and not by Christ; and are ignorant
of the steps and methods taken to procure it; nor do they know the way
of peace of conscience, or how to attain to that which is true and
solid; nor the way to eternal peace and happiness, which is alone by
Christ, and the Gospel of peace reveals, to which they are strangers;
nor the way of peace among men, which they are unconcerned about, and do
not seek after, make use of no methods to promote, secure, and establish
it; but all the reverse:

and there is no judgment in their goings; no justice in their actions,
in their dealings with men; no judgment in their religious duties, which
are done without any regard to the divine rule, or without being able to
give a reason for them; they have no judgment in matters of doctrine or
worship; they have no discerning of true and false doctrines, and
between that which is spiritual and superstitious in worship; they have
no knowledge of the word of God, which should be their guide both in
faith and practice; but this they do not attend unto:

they have made them crooked paths: they have devised paths and modes of
worship of their own, in which they walk, and which they observe, that
are not according to the rule of the word; but deviate from it; and so
may be said to be crooked, as not agreeable to that:

whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace; the way of peace with God,
as before; or he shall not have any experience of true, solid, and
substantial peace in his own conscience now, and shall not attain to
eternal peace hereafter.

[Isaiah 59:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 59:9</span></span>

Therefore is judgment far from us,.... These are the words of the few
godly persons in those times, taking notice of prevailing sins,
confessing and lamenting them, and observing that these were the source
of their calamities under which they groaned; "therefore", because of
the above mentioned sins, and in just retaliation, no justice or
judgment being among men; therefore, in great righteousness "judgment is
far from us"; or God does not appear to right our wrongs, and avenge us
of our enemies, but suffers them to afflict and distress us:

neither doth justice overtake us; the righteousness of God inflicting
vengeance on our enemies, and saving and protecting us; this does not
come up with us, nor do we enjoy the benefit of it, but walk on without
it unprotected, and exposed to the insults of men:

we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, but we walk in
darkness; or "for brightnesses" (y); for much clear light; but

we walk in mists (z); in thick fogs, and have scarce any light at all.
The meaning is, they waited for deliverance and salvation; but instead
of that had the darkness of affliction and distress; or they were
expecting latter day light and glory, the clear and bright shining of
Gospel truths; but, instead of that, were surrounded with the darkness
of ignorance and infidelity, superstition and will worship, and walked
in the mists and fogs of error and heresy of all sorts: this seems to
respect the same time as in [Zac 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#006.md).

[Isaiah 59:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 59:10</span></span>

We grope for the wall like the blind,.... Who either with their hands,
or with a staff in them, feel for the wall to lean against, or to guide
them in the way, or into the house, that they may know whereabout they
are, and how they should steer their course:

and we grope as if we had no eyes: which yet they had, the eyes of their
reason and understanding; but which either were not opened, or they made
no use of them in searching the Scriptures, to come at the light and
knowledge of divine things; and therefore only at most groped after them
by the dim light of nature, if thereby they might find them. This is to
be understood not of them all, but of many, and of the greatest part:

we stumble at noonday as in the night; as many persons do now: for
though it is noonday in some respects, and in some places, where the
Gospel and the truths of it are clearly preached; yet men stumble and
fall into the greatest errors, as in the night of the greatest darkness;
as if it was either the night of Paganism or Popery with them:

we are in desolate places as dead men; or "in fatnesses" (a); in fat
places where the word and ordinances are administered, where is plenty
of the means of grace, yet not quickened thereby; are as dead men, dead
in trespasses and sin, and at most have only a name to live, but are
dead. Some render it, "in the graves" (b); and the Targum thus,

"it is shut before us, as the graves are shut before the dead;''

we have no more light, joy, and comfort, than those in the graves have.

pinguetudinibus", Piscator; "in opimis rebus", Vitringa. (b) "In
sepulchris", Pagninus; and so Ben Melech interprets it.

[Isaiah 59:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 59:11</span></span>

We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves,.... Some in a more
noisy and clamorous, others in a stiller way, yet all in private: for
the bear, when robbed of its whelps, goes to its den and roars; and the
dove, when it has lost its mate, mourns in solitude: this expresses the
secret groanings of the saints under a sense of sin, and the forlorn
state of religion. The Targum paraphrases it thus,

"we roar because of our enemies, who are gathered against us as bears;
all of us indeed mourn sore as doves:''

we look for judgment, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far
from us; we expect that God will take vengeance on our enemies, and save
us; look for judgment on antichrist, and the antichristian states, and
for the salvation of the church of God; for the vials of divine wrath on
the one, and for happy times to the other; but neither of them as yet
come; the reason of which is as follows.

[Isaiah 59:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 59:12</span></span>

For our transgressions are multiplied before thee,.... Not only an
increase of immorality among the people in common, but among professors
of religion; and as their transgressions are committed against the Lord,
so they are in his sight taken notice of and observed by him, are
loathsome and abominable to him, and call aloud for his judgments on
them:

and our sins testify against us; God is a witness against us, in whose
sight our sins are done; and our consciences are witnesses against us,
which are as a thousand witnesses; and there is no denying facts; our
sins stare us in the face, and we must confess our guilt: or, "our sins
answer against us" (c); as witnesses called and examined answer to the
questions put, so our sins, being brought as it were into open court,
answer and bear testimony against us; or it must be owned, our
punishment for our sins answers to them; it is the echo of our sins,
what they call for, and righteously comes upon us:

for our transgressions are with us; or, "on us" (d); in our minds, on
our consciences, loading us with guilt; continually accusing and
condemning us; are manifest to us, as the Targum; too manifest to be
denied:

and as for our iniquities, we know them; the nature and number of them,
and the aggravating circumstances that attend them; and cannot but own
and acknowledge them, confess, lament, and bewail them; an enumeration
of which follows.

\(c\) "peccata nostra respondit contra nos", Montanus; "id ipsum
respondit contra nos", Cocceius; "even everyone of them", so Junius &
Tremellius; "peccatorum nostrorum quodque", sic (d) "super nos",

[Isaiah 59:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 59:13</span></span>

In transgressing and lying against the Lord,.... The word of the Lord,
as the Targum; they transgress the doctrine of Christ, as well as the
law of God, and deny him the only Lord God, even our Lord Jesus Christ,
his proper deity, his righteousness, and satisfaction, which is
notorious in our days; so the Syriac version renders it,

we have denied the Lord; the Lord that bought them: this is the case of
many under a profession of Christ:

and departing away from our God: from following him, from walking in his
ways, from attending his worship, word, and ordinances; so the Targum,

"from the worship of our God;''

from Immanuel, God with us, God in our nature; from him the living God,
as every degree of unbelief is a departing from him; and especially he
is departed from when his divine Person is denied; when neglected as the
Saviour; his Gospel corrupted; his ordinances perverted, and his
worship, or the assembly of the saints, forsaken:

speaking oppression and revolt: such who are in public office, speakers
in the church of God; these speak what is oppressive and burdensome to
the minds and consciences of those who are truly gracious; make their
hearts sad, whom God would not have made sad, by their false doctrines;
and which have a tendency to cause men to revolt from the Lord, and turn
their backs on him: or "speak calumny and defection" (e), as some render
it; calumniate, reproach, and revile the few faithful ones, and draw off
many from the truths of the Gospel, and a profession of them. The Targum
renders it, "falsehood and apostasy"; false doctrine, which leads to
apostasy from Christ; with which the next clause agrees:

conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood; false
doctrines; such as agree not with, but are contrary to, the word of God;
these are of their own conceiving and contriving; the produce of their
own brains; the fruit of their own fancy and imaginations; and which,
out of the abundance of their hearts, they utter, even premeditated
falsehoods, studied lies, as in [Isa
59:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#003.md); see Gill on [Isa
59:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#003.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 59:14</span></span>

And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off,....
Jarchi interprets this of the vengeance of God, and his righteousness in
his judgments, not immediately executed; but it is to be understood of
the want of judgment and justice being done among men; and therefore are
represented as persons turned back, and standing afar off, rejected,
neglected, and discouraged. The Targum renders it,

"they that do judgment are turned back, and they that do justice stand
afar off;''

having none to take their parts, but everyone opposing them: this may
respect both the want of judgment and justice in courts of judicature;
no regard being had to right and wrong; no true judgment being given, or
justice done, in any cause; but both banished from the bench: and also
in the churches of Christ, or, however, under a profession of his name,
where there is no judgment in doctrines, or discerning between truth and
error; and no justice inflicted on delinquents according to the rules of
Christ; no order nor discipline observed in his house; these are
dismissed and discarded:

for truth is fallen in the street; where it used to be preached,
exalted, established, and confirmed; but now thrown down and trampled
upon, and few or none to help it up, and stand by it; and though it may
have some secret well wishers, yet very few, if any, public advocates
for it:

and equity cannot enter; either into civil courts, or Christian
congregations; the doing of that which is just and right between man and
man in things civil; and between Christian and Christian in things
religious; or that which is right according to the word of God; can find
no place, or cannot be admitted into assemblies that are called by his
name. The Targum is,

"they that do truth stumble in the street; and they that exercise faith
cannot be made manifest;''

such as are on the side of truth, in the service of it, cannot stand
their ground through the violence of their opposers; and those that are
faithful, and abide by the doctrine of faith, are forced to hide
themselves, and cannot appear in the vindication of it.

[Isaiah 59:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 59:15</span></span>

Yea, truth faileth,.... Or, "is deprived" (f); of its life and being; it
not only falls in the street, and there lies, without any to show regard
unto it; but it fails; it seems as if it had given up the ghost and
expired; so very prevalent will error be, before light and truth spring
up again and be victorious, as they will:

and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey; he that does not
give in to the prevailing vices of the age in which he lives, now become
fashionable, but abstains from them, and departs from doctrinal as well
as practical evils; from all false doctrines, and from all superstitious
modes of worship; becomes a prey to others; a reproach and a laughing
stock to them; they scoff at him, and deride him for his preciseness in
religion; for his enthusiastic and irrational notions in doctrine; and
for his stiffness in matters of worship: or, "he makes himself reckoned
a madman" (g); as some render it; and this is a common notion with
profane men, and loose professors, to reckon such as madmen that are
upright in doctrine, worship, and conversation; see [Act
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#024.md),

and the Lord saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment;
he took notice of all this, and resented it, though in a professing
people, that there was no judgment or discretion in matters of doctrine
and worship; no order or discipline observed; no justice done in civil
courts, or in the church of God; no reformation in church or state.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 59:16</span></span>

And he saw that there was no man,.... Whose works are good, as the
Targum adds; no good man, or faithful and righteous one, that had any
regard to truth and justice; that was an advocate for truth, and opposed
error, and set on foot a reformation; or was concerned for any of these
things, and mourned over the general corruption; not that it must be
thought there was not one individual person, but very few, comparatively
none; since mention is made before of some that departed from evil, and
made themselves a prey:

and wondered that there was no intercessor; to stand up, and pray for
them, as the Targum; so it seems a spirit of prayer and supplication
will be greatly wanting in the times of latter day darkness, and before
latter day glory breaks out: or, "that there was no interposer" (h);
none to appear on the side of truth and justice, and on the behalf of
those that become a prey to others. "Wonder" is here ascribed to God by
an anthropopathy, after the manner of men, as being a marvellous and
surprising thing, and almost incredible, that none could be found in so
good a cause, and taking the part of injured truth and righteousness;
and it expresses the general corruption and defect of religion in those
times; and shows that it is not for the goodness of men, or their
merits, that the Lord will do what is next said he did:

therefore his arm brought salvation to him; either to himself, and which
redounded to his own honour and glory; or to his people, those that
became a prey to their enemies; these he rescued out of their hands, and
by his own arm of power saved them; or he himself alone wrought out
salvation for them, and delivered them from the insults, reproach, and
persecution of men, under whatsoever name; so when antichrist, and
antichristianism in every form, shall be destroyed, salvation will be
ascribed to God alone, [Rev 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#001.md),

and his righteousness, it sustained him; his righteousness, in taking
vengeance on his and his people's enemies; and his faithfulness, in the
performance of his promises, will support him in, and carry him through,
his work, though attended with difficulties that may seem insuperable to
men: this may be understood of Christ, as well as what follows. The Jews
(i) interpret this of the Messiah, who should come in an age in which
are none but wicked men, as is here said.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 59:17</span></span>

For he put on righteousness as a breastplate,.... Here the Lord is
represented as a warrior clothed with armour, and as Christ is, and as
he will appear in the latter day on the behalf of his people, and
against their enemies, who is called faithful and true, and in
righteousness will make war, [Rev
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011.md), he will proceed according to
justice and equity in righting the wrongs and avenging the injuries of
his people; and both in saving them, and destroying their enemies, he
will secure the honour of his faithfulness and justice, and the credit
of his name and character; which will be preserved by his conduct, as
the breast and inward parts are by the breastplate:

and an helmet of salvation upon his head; the salvation he will work out
for his people will be very conspicuous; it will be seen by all, as the
helmet on the head; and he will have the glory of it, on whose head are
many crowns, [Rev 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#012.md). The apostle
has borrowed these phrases from hence, and applied them to the Christian
armour, [Eph 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#014.md),

and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing; or, "he clothed
himself with vengeance as a garment" (k); he wrapped himself in it, and
resolved to execute it on his and his people's enemies; the time being
come to avenge the blood of his servants, by shedding the blood of their
adversaries, with which his garments will be stained; and therefore is
represented as having on a vesture dipped in blood, [Rev
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#013.md),

and was clad with zeal as a cloak; with zeal for his own glory, and the
interest of his people, and against antichrist, and all antichristian
worship and doctrine; and therefore his eyes are said to be as a flame
of fire, [Rev 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#012.md).

According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay,.... As the enemies
of his people have treated them, so will the Lord deal with them; as
they have shed their blood, he will, according to the laws of
retribution and retaliation, give them blood to drink, as they deserve.
The whore of Rome shall be rewarded as the followers of Christ have been
rewarded by her, and double shall be rendered to her double, according
to her works, [Rev 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#006.md),

fury to his adversaries, recompence to his enemies: the church's
adversaries and enemies are Christ's, and so he esteems them; and
therefore his wrath and fury is poured out by way of recompence to them,
for all the ill they have done them, even the cup of the wine of the
fierceness of his wrath, [Rev 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#019.md),

to the islands he will repay recompence; even to those who dwell in the
more distant and remote parts of the antichristian jurisdiction; for
when the cup of wrath shall be given to Babylon every island will flee
away, [Rev 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#020.md).

[Isaiah 59:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 59:19</span></span>

So shall they fear the name of the Lord from the west, and his glory
from the rising of the sun,.... The eastern and western antichrist being
destroyed, way shall be made for the spread of the Gospel east and west;
which shall be everywhere embraced, and the true worship of God set up;
and the glorious name of the Lord, or the Lord who is glorious in his
name, nature, perfections, and works, shall be feared and served from
the rising of the sun to the setting of the same, or by all nations
under the heavens; see [Mal 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#011.md) and
even those that are left in the antichristian states, and escape the
general ruin, shall be frightened at his judgments, fear his great and
awful name, and give glory to the God of heaven, [Rev
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#013.md).

when the enemy shall come in like a flood; when Satan, the common
"enemy" of mankind, the avowed and implacable enemy of Christ and his
people, "shall come" into the world, and into the church, as he will in
the latter day; and has already entered "like" an impetuous flood,
threatening to carry all before him, introducing a flood of immorality
and profaneness, as in the days of Noah and Lot, to which the times of
the Son of Man's coming are likened, [Luk
17:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#026.md) or else a flood of error and
heresy of all sorts; see [Rev 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#015.md)
and likewise a flood of persecution, as will be at the slaying of the
witnesses, that hour of temptation that will come upon all the earth, to
try the inhabitants of it, [Rev 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#010.md).
Aben Ezra compares this passage with, and illustrates it by, that time
of trouble which will be, such as never was since there was a nation,
[Dan 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md) when this will be the case,
which seems to be near at hand:

the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him; Christ and
his Gospel, or Christ the standard lifted up in the ministry of the
Gospel, [Isa 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010.md) a set of ministers
shall be raised up, having the everlasting Gospel, which they shall
publish to all nations, and which shall have an universal spread; and by
means of which the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord
as the waters cover the sea; and which will be a sufficient check to the
enemy's flood of immorality, error, and persecution; and which, after
this, shall be no more; see [Rev 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#006.md).
Some render the words, "when he", the glorious name of the Lord, or he
who is the glory of the Lord, the brightness of his glory;

shall come like a narrow flood, that flows with great swiftness and
force, and carries all before it;

the Spirit of the Lord lifting him up for a standard (l), that is, in
the ministry of the word; "so shall they fear", &c.; then multitudes
shall serve the Lord, and worship him. The Targum is,

"they that afflict shall be as the overflowing of the river Euphrates;
by the word of the Lord shall they be broken;''

and Vitringa thinks there is an allusion to the river Euphrates;
interpreting the enemy of the Ottoman Turks, Tartars, and Scythians,
stirred up by Satan to distress the church: all this may be applied to
the case of particular believers under the assaults of Satan their grand
enemy; who seeks all occasions to disturb their peace and destroy their
comfort, though he cannot ruin their souls; he comes in, not only into
their houses where they dwell, and gives them disturbance there; and
into the house of God where they worship, and does all he can to hinder
them in attending on the word and ordinances, and to prevent all
usefulness, edification, and comfort thereby; but he enters into their
hearts, and stirs up the corruptions of their nature, and causes these
to rise like a flood, which threaten with bringing them into captivity
to the law of sin and death; and attacks them with violent temptations,
suggesting that they are not the people of God, the redeemed of the
Lamb, or regenerated by the Spirit, but are hypocrites, and never had
the work of grace on their hearts; aggravating their sins, and telling
them they have sinned the sin against the Holy Ghost, and there is no
pardon for them; and at other times filling their minds with blasphemous
and atheistical thoughts; all which come upon them sometimes with so
much force, that it is like an overflowing flood that threatens with
utter destruction; when the Spirit of the Lord within them, who is
greater than he that is in the world, lifts up Christ as an ensign or
standard to them; and directs them to his blood for peace and pardon,
for the cleansing of their souls and the atonement of their sins; where
they may see and read, in legible characters, the free and full
remission of their sins, and an entire satisfaction to the justice of
God for them; and he holds up and holds out the righteousness of Christ
unto them, with which God is well pleased, his justice satisfied, and
his law made honourable; and by which they are justified from all
things, and secured from all charges and condemnation; and who also
leads them to the person, power, and grace of Christ, to preserve them
in grace to glory, to keep them from falling, and present them faultless
before the throne of God; the consequence of which is a check to Satan's
temptations; an antidote to the doubts and fears he injects; and an
abundance of spiritual peace and comfort; as well as it engages to fear
the Lord and his goodness.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 59:20</span></span>

And the Redeemer shall come to Zion,.... Not Cyrus, as some; but the
Messiah, as it is applied in the Talmud (m) and in other Jewish writers
(n), and as Aben Ezra rightly interprets it; and so Kimchi, who also
understands by the enemy, in the preceding verse, Gog and Magog; and
this must be understood not of the first coming of Christ to redeem his
people by his blood from sin, Satan, and the law; but of his spiritual
coming to Zion to the church of God in the latter day, at the time of
the conversion of the Jews, as appears from the quotation, and
application of it by the apostle, [Rom
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025.md) and with it compare [Rev
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#001.md),

and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the Lord;
that is, to such among the Jews, the posterity of Jacob, who repent of
their sins, and turn from them; and particularly their sin of the
rejection of the Messiah, and the disbelief of him, and turn to him, and
believe in him as their Saviour and King. The Targum is,

"and the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and to turn the transgressors of
the house of Jacob to the law;''

but rather the turn will be to the Gospel of Christ.

[Isaiah 59:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 59:21</span></span>

As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the Lord,.... Which
shall be manifested and made good to them that repent of their sins,
and, believe in Christ; and to whom the particular blessing of it shall
be applied, the forgiveness of their sins; see [Rom
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#027.md),

my Spirit which is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy
mouth; the Spirit of God, with his gifts and graces, which were upon
Christ the Redeemer without measure; and the doctrines he received from
his divine Father to teach others, and which he gave to his apostles;
the same Spirit which in measure was put upon them, and the same truths
which were delivered to them:

shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor
out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the Lord, from henceforth and
for ever; that is, shall always continue with the church and her
spiritual seed, such as are born in her, and brought up by her,
throughout all successive ages, and to the end of time; and it may be
observed, that after the conversion of the Jews, to which this prophecy
has a special regard, they shall no more apostatize; the Spirit of the
Lord shall not depart from them; and the Gospel shall always be
professed by them: and it may be further observed, that the Spirit and
the word go together; and that the latter is only effectual as
accompanied will, the former, and is a proof of the perseverance of the
church of God, and of all such who have the Spirit and grace of God,
Christ will always have a church, and that church a seed, in which the
Spirit and word will always remain. The grace of the Spirit, in the
hearts of God's people, never removes from them; nor his Gospel from
such, in whose hearts it works effectually. The Targum interprets this
of the words of prophecy; and the Talmud (o) of the law not departing
from the disciples of wise men; but it is best to understand it of the
Gospel not departing from the disciples of Christ, and the seed of the
church.
