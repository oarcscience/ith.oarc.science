[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 16:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO 1 CHRONICLES 16

This chapter relates that David offered sacrifices when the ark was
brought into his city, [Ch1 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#001) who
were the singers he appointed to sing before it continually, [Ch1
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#004) and the song he that day composed
and delivered to them to sing, [Ch1
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#007) and that he appointed not only
proper persons to minister before the ark, but also before the
tabernacle at Gibeon, [Ch1 16:37](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#037).

[1 Chronicles 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 16:1</span></span>

So they brought the ark of God,.... What is contained in these three
verses is the same with [Sa2 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#017), see
the notes there. See Gill on [Sa2
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#017). See Gill on [Sa2
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#018). See Gill on [Sa2
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#019).

[1 Chronicles 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 16:4</span></span>

And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of
the Lord,.... By singing the praises of God:

and to record; or bring to remembrance; to commemorate in a song the
great and good things God had done for Israel as a people:

and to thank and praise the Lord God of Israel; for all his benefits,
and the blessings of his goodness bestowed on them.

[1 Chronicles 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 16:5</span></span>

Asaph the chief,.... Of those that were now appointed: otherwise, of the
three principal singers, Heman was the chief, and Asaph next, [Ch1
6:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#033).

and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and
Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, with
psalteries, and with harps; to play upon them before the ark at the same
time the psalms and songs were vocally sung; the above persons are such
as are named before, [Ch1 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#018),

but Asaph made a sound with cymbals; he struck and played upon them, see
[Ch1 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#019).

[1 Chronicles 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 16:6</span></span>

Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests,.... These were appointed to blow

with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of the Lord;
morning and evening.

[1 Chronicles 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 16:7</span></span>

Then on that day,.... The ark was brought to Zion, and the above persons
appointed to minister before it:

David delivered first this psalm to thank the Lord into the hand of
Asaph and his brethren to be sung by them now, and on every proper
occasion; and this seems to be the first that was delivered to them;
afterwards there were many more, as the titles of the psalms show; the
following is composed of part of two others, as they now stand in the
book of Psalms. From hence, to the end of [Ch1
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#022) is the same with [Psa
105:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#001), with a little variation, see
the notes there; and from thence to the end of [Ch1
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#033) is [Psa
96:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001) which see; and [Ch1
16:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#034) is the same with [Psa
106:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#001), see the notes there. See Gill
on [Psa 106:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#001), [Psa
107:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#001), [Psa
105:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#001), [Psa
105:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#002), [Psa
105:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#003), [Psa
105:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#004), [Psa
105:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#005), [Psa
105:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#006), [Psa
105:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#007), [Psa
105:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#008), [Psa
105:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#009), [Psa
105:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#010), [Psa
105:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#011),on [Psa
105:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#012), [Psa
105:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#013), [Psa
105:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#014),on [Psa
105:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#015)

[1 Chronicles 16:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">ch1 16:35</span></span>

And say ye, save us, O God of our salvation,.... The author of temporal,
spiritual, and eternal salvation; the words are a direction to the
singers, and those that sung with them, to express the prayer and
doxology in the next verse, which both are the same with [Psa
106:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#047). See Gill on [Psa
106:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#047), [Psa
106:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#048); which David directed by a
spirit of prophecy, foreseeing the people of Israel would be in
captivity among the Heathens; though some think these were added by
Ezra; for though there was in his time a return from the captivity, yet
many still remained in it.

[1 Chronicles 16:37](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">ch1 16:37</span></span>

So he left there, before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, Asaph and
his brethren,.... Whom he, that is, David, had appointed for the service
of it:

to minister before the ark continually; in singing the praises of God:

as every day's work required; at the time of the morning and evening
sacrifice, as Jarchi and Kimchi interpret it.

[1 Chronicles 16:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">ch1 16:38</span></span>

The Levites, the brethren of Asaph and Obededom, these were left before
the ark to minister there:

Obededom also the son of Jeduthun; or Ethan, which some take to be
another Obededom; but the "vau" may be explanative, "even Obededom":

and Hosah to be porters; these he left to be doorkeepers of the ark.

[1 Chronicles 16:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">ch1 16:39</span></span>

And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests,.... These he left,
having appointed them

to be before the tabernacle of the Lord, in the high place that was at
Gibeon; namely, the tabernacle of Moses, which was removed from Nob
thither in the days of Saul, and continued there to the times of
Solomon, [Ch1 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#028).

[1 Chronicles 16:40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">ch1 16:40</span></span>

To offer burnt offerings unto the Lord,.... Which was the work of the
priests only to do:

upon the altar of burnt offering continually morning and evening; the
lambs of the daily sacrifice, which were a burnt offering, and only to
be offered on the brasen altar at the tabernacle:

and to do according to all that is written in the law of the Lord, which
he commanded Israel; with regard to them, and all other sacrifices, see
[Exo 29:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#038).

[1 Chronicles 16:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">ch1 16:41</span></span>

And with them,.... That is, with Zadok, and the priests with him at
Gibeon:

he left Heman and Jeduthun: or Ethan, two principal singers:

and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name; see [Ch1
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#018).

to give thanks to the Lord, because his mercy endureth for ever; to
praise him for his benefits, flowing from his grace and mercy
continually.

[1 Chronicles 16:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">ch1 16:42</span></span>

And with them Heman and Jeduthun, with trumpets and cymbals,.... Or with
them were the trumpets and cymbals, as Kimchi; or, as Piscator supplies
it, with them he "left" the trumpets and cymbals:

for those that should make a sound; by striking upon them:

and with musical instruments of God; sacred ones, such as were devoted
to his service, as psalteries and harps; the Syriac and Arabic versions
carry the sense of the words quite differently, that these men did not
sing with those musical instruments, but with a pleasant voice, and with
pure and acceptable prayers, in humility and uprightness, glorified God:

and the sons of Jeduthun were porters; at the tabernacle in Gibeon.

[1 Chronicles 16:43](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">ch1 16:43</span></span>

And all the people departed, every man to his house,.... Having
accompanied the ark to its place, and having praised the Lord for it,
and been refreshed with food, see [Sa2
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#019).

and David returned to bless his house; his family; the Targum is,"to
bless the people;''see [Sa2 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#020).
