### [Psalms Chapter 62](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 62:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO PSALM 62

To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of David. Concerning
"Jeduthun", See Gill on [Psa 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#001.md),
title. Kimchi thinks this psalm was written concerning the captivity;
and Jarchi , concerning the decrees and judgments made against Israel by
their enemies; and so some of their ancient expositions (d); but it
seems to have been composed by David when in distress, either through
Saul and his courtiers, or by reason of the conspiracy of Absalom.
Theodoret takes it to be a prophecy of the persecution of Antiochus in
the times of the Maccabees.

[Psalms 62:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 62:1</span></span>

Truly my soul waiteth upon God,.... In the use of means, for answers of
prayer, for performance of promises, and for deliverance from enemies,
and out of every trouble: or "is silent" (e), as the Targum; not as to
prayer, but as to murmuring; patiently and quietly waiting for salvation
until the Lord's time come to give it; being "subject" to him, as the
Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions; resigned to
his will, and patient under his afflicting hand: it denotes a quiet,
patient, waiting on the Lord, and not merely bodily exercise in outward
ordinances; but an inward frame of spirit, a soul waiting on the Lord,
and that in truth and reality, in opposition to mere form and show; and
with constancy "waiteth", and "only" (f) on him, as the same particle is
rendered in [Psa 62:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#002.md); and so Aben
Ezra here;

from him cometh my salvation; both temporal, spiritual, and eternal, and
not from any creature; the consideration of which makes the mind quiet
and easy under afflictive provide uses: the contrivance of everlasting
salvation is from the Father, the impetration of it from the Son, and
the application of it from the Spirit.

[Psalms 62:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 62:2</span></span>

He only is my Rock and my salvation,.... The Rock on which the church is
built, and every believer; and which was David's safety, shelter, and
shade, and which made him easy in his present state; and he was the
author of his salvation, and the rock and strength of it, [Psa
95:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#001.md);

he is my defence; or refuge; see [Psa
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#009.md);

I shall not be greatly moved; or "with much motion", as Kimchi; or "with
great motions", as Jarchi: he could not be moved off of the rock on
which he was built; nor out of the city of refuge, whither he had betook
himself for safety; and though he might be troubled in spirit, and
shaken in mind, and staggered in his faith, and fall from some degree of
steadfastness of it; yet not fall so as to be utterly cast down, or
finally and totally, and so as to perish eternally. Aben Ezra interprets
it, "shall not be moved" into the great deep; into the abyss or
bottomless pit; and so some of the ancient Midrashes expound of "hell"
(g); but much better is the Targum,

"I shall not be moved in a day of great affliction;''

see [Act 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#023.md).

\(g\) Vid. Jarchi & Yalkut Simeoni in loc.

[Psalms 62:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 62:3</span></span>

How long will ye imagine mischief against a man?.... Against a good man,
as the Targum; or against any Israelite, as Kimchi; or rather he means
himself, a single man, a weak man, and an innocent one; which aggravated
their sin, in devising his hurt, and contriving ways to take away his
life, as did Saul and his courtiers; and, Absalom, and those that were
with him. R. Jonah, from the Arabic language, interprets the word here
used of putting or drawing out the tongue to a great length; that is,
multiplying words, as lies and calumnies, in agreement with [Psa
62:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#004.md); but Jarchi, Aben Ezra, and
Kimchi, explain it as we do, of devising mischief. The Targum is,

"how long do ye rage against a good man?''

Ye shall be slain all of you; this is a further aggravation of their
folly, since it would issue in their own ruin; the mischief they devised
for him would fall upon themselves. Some understand this , "by way of
prayer"; as Aben Ezra, Kimchi, and Ben Melech,

"may ye be slain all of you:''

there is a double reading of these words; Ben Napthali, who is followed
by the eastern Jews, reads them actively, "ye shall slay"; with which
agree the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, and all the Oriental versions; and
so the Targum,

"ye shall become murderers all of you.''

Ben Asher, who is followed by the western Jews, reads passively as we
do, "ye shall be slain"; and which is approved by Aben Ezra, Kimchi, and
others;

as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering fence; which are easily
and suddenly pushed down; and so these similes denote the easy, sudden,
and certain destruction of those men; see [Isa
36:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#013.md); though some connect the words
with the men against whom mischief was imagined by his enemies, who was
like a bowing wall and a tottering fence; and so are expressive of his
weakness, and of the easy destruction of him; and read the words, "ye
shall be slain all of you", in a parenthesis; but the former sense seems
best.

[Psalms 62:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 62:4</span></span>

They only consult to cast him down from his excellency,.... Either from
the excellency of God, from his greatness, and from his height, as
Kimchi; or from his grace, as the Arabic version: that is, they
consulted to discourage him from looking to God, his rock and fortress,
and from trusting in him; or rather, from his own excellency, from what
high estate of dignity and honour he was advanced to, or designed for,
namely his kingly office. Saul and his courtiers consulted how to
prevent his coming to the throne, and Absalom and Ahithophel how to pull
him down from it, and seize his crown and kingdom; which latter best
agrees with the expression here;

they delight in lies; in making and in spreading them, in order to hurt
his character, and give his subjects an ill opinion of him; and thereby
alienate their affections from him, and weaken their allegiance and
obedience to him; see [Rev 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#015.md);

they bless with their mouth: saying, God bless the king, or save the
king:

but they curse inwardly; they curse the king in their hearts, and when
by themselves in private, when they imagine nobody hears them; see [Ecc
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#020.md).

Selah; on this word; see Gill on [Psa
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#002.md).

[Psalms 62:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 62:5</span></span>

My soul, wait thou only upon God,.... Be silent and subject to him,
acquiesce in his providences, rest in him patiently and quietly, wait
for his salvation; See Gill on [Psa
62:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#001.md); perhaps some new temptation
might arise, and David's soul began to be uneasy and impatient; for
frames are very changeable things; and therefore he encourages it to be
still and quiet, and patiently wait on the Lord, and on him only:

for my expectation is from him; or "my hope", as the Targum; the grace
of hope is from the Lord, and the thing hoped for is from him; he is the
author and the object of it; and his word of promise encourages to the
exercise of it; or "my patience"; as the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, and
Arabic versions. The grace of patience is from the Lord; the means of it
is his word; and it is exercised, tried, and increased by afflictions
sent and sanctified by him; and "expectation" is nothing else than these
graces in exercise, a waiting patiently for things hoped for Old
Testament saints expected the first coming of Christ; New Testament
saints expect his second coming; and all expect good things from him in
time and eternity; nor shall their expectation fail and perish; and
therefore is a reason why their souls should wait only on the Lord.

[Psalms 62:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 62:6</span></span>

He only is my rock and my salvation,.... See Gill on [Psa
62:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#002.md);

he is my defence; these epithets of God are repeated, to strengthen his
faith and hope in him, and to encourage a patient waiting upon him;

I shall not be moved; neither greatly, nor at all; his faith gets fresh
strength and rigour, the more he considers God as his rock, salvation,
defence, and refuge; See Gill on [Psa
62:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#002.md).

[Psalms 62:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 62:7</span></span>

In God is my salvation,.... Or "upon God" (h); he that is God over all
has took it upon him to save me; he is the author of salvation to me;
and it is in him safe and secure, and I shall be saved in him with an
everlasting salvation:

and my glory; the author of all his temporal glory, honour, and dignity;
and of all his spiritual glory, which lay in the righteousness of Christ
put upon him, and in the grace of God wrought in him; and of the eternal
glory he was waiting for; and besides, God was the object of his
glorying, of whom he boasted, and in whom he gloried; see [Psa
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#003.md);

the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God; not only his
strength, as well as his righteousness and refuge; but the firmness and
security of his strength were in God, who is the Rock of ages, in whom
is everlasting strength.

[Psalms 62:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 62:8</span></span>

Trust in him at all times, ye people,.... Of the house of Israel, as the
Targum; or of God, as Aben Ezra; all that are Israelites indeed, and are
the Lord's covenant people; these are exhorted and encouraged to trust
in him; not in a creature, nor in any outward thing, in riches, wisdom,
strength, birth, privileges, the law, and the works of it; in their own
righteousness, in their hearts, in themselves or in others; but in the
Lord only, both for temporal and spiritual blessings: the Targum is, "in
his Word"; his essential Word, by whom the world was made, and who, in
the fulness of time, was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and who is a
proper object of trust; in him should the people of God trust; in his
person for acceptance with God, in his righteousness for justification,
in his blood for pardon, in his grace for supply, and in his strength
for support, deliverance, and salvation, and that "at all times": there
is no time excepted; there is not a moment in which the Lord is not to
be trusted in: he is to be trusted in in adversity as well as in
prosperity; in times of affliction, when he is present, and will not
forsake; in times of temptation, when his grace is sufficient for them;
and in times of darkness, when he will arise and appear unto them;

pour out your heart before him: as Hannah did, [Sa1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#015.md); and as water is poured out, [Lam
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#019.md); it means the desires of the
heart, the complaints of the soul, the whole of their case which they
should spread before the Lord, and make known unto him; see [Psa
102:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#001.md), title, and [Psa 142:
2](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#002.md); the phrase denotes the abundance of
the heart, and of its requests, and the freedom with which they should
be made to the Lord; for through the blood and sacrifice of Christ a
believer may come to the throne of grace with boldness and liberty, and
there freely tell the Lord all his mind, and all that is in his heart;

God is a refuge for us; to whom the saints may have recourse in all
their times of trouble, and where they find safety and plenty, [Isa
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#016.md).

Selah; on this word; see Gill on [Psa
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#002.md).

[Psalms 62:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 62:9</span></span>

Surely men of low degree are vanity,.... Or "sons of Adam" (i); of the
earthly man; of fallen Adam; one of his immediate sons was called Hebel,
"vanity"; and it is true of all his sons; but here it designs only one
sort of them; such as are poor and low in the world; mean men, as the
phrase is rendered in [Isa 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#009.md); See
Gill on [Psa 49:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#002.md); these are subject
to sinful vanity; their thoughts are vain, their affections vain, their
minds vain, their conversation vain, sinful, foolish, fallacious, and
inconstant. The wicked poor are, generally speaking, of all persons, the
most wicked; and therefore, though they are the multitude, they are not
to be trusted in. The Arabic version is, they are as a "shadow",
fleeting and unstable, no solidity in them; the Syriac version, "as a
vapour", that soon passeth away, like the breath of the mouth, and so
not to be accounted of;

and men of high degree are a lie; or "sons of men"; of "the great man"
(k), as it is rendered in [Isa 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#009.md),
noblemen, men of high birth, fortune, rank, and quality; these are a
"lie", fallacious and deceitful: they talk of their blood, as if it was
different from the rest of mankind; but, trace them up to their
original, Adam, and it is a lie. All men are made of one blood, [Act
17:26](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#026.md); their riches promise them peace
and pleasure, and long life, but do not give those things, [Luk
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#016.md); their honour is fickle and
inconstant; they are act in high places, and those are slippery ones;
they are brought to desolation in a moment; and if they continue in them
till death, their glory does not descend after them, [Psa
49:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#017.md); they make promises of great
things to those who apply to them, but rarely perform, and are by no
means to be confided in. This distinction of high and low degree is
observed in [Jam 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#009.md);

to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity; take
a pair of balances, and put men both of high and low degree together in
one scale, and vanity in the other, vanity will weigh heaviest; the
scale in which men are will go up, as the word (l) here used signifies:
they are "in the balances to ascend"; or being put in the balances, they
will ascend, and the scale in which vanity is will go down; for, take
them altogether, they are "lighter" than that: the word "lighter" is not
in the text, but is rightly supplied, as it is by Aben Ezra, Kimchi, and
Ben Melech. This last clause, according to the accents, may be best
rendered thus; being put "in the balance, they must ascend; they are
lighter than vanity together". The Targum is,

"if they should take the sons of men in a balance, and weigh their
fates, they themselves would be "lighter" than nothing, as one;''

or than vanity together.

[Psalms 62:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 62:10</span></span>

Trust not in oppression,.... Either in the power of oppressing others;
see [Isa 30:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#012.md); or in riches gotten by
oppression, which being put into a man's hand by his friend, he keeps,
and will not return them; so Aben Ezra and Kimchi interpret it of mammon
unlawfully obtained; mammon of unrighteousness, or unrighteous mammon;
see [Jer 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#011.md);

and become not vain in robbery; in riches gotten by open rapine and
theft; and men become vain herein when they boast of such riches, place
their confidence in them, and think to make atonement for their sins by
burnt sacrifices purchased with them, [Isa
61:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#008.md);

if riches increase; in a lawful way, in such manner as the fruits of the
earth do, as the word (m) used signifies: if they increase in great
abundance from a little, as from one grain of corn many proceed; and
insensibly, as the seed sown grows up, a man knows not how, through
diligence and the blessing of God from heaven;

set not your heart upon them; your affections on them; they are
ensnaring, they are apt to take the heart from God, to draw off the
affections from Christ and things above, to choke the word, and lead
into many temptations and harmful lusts; let not your hearts be elated,
or lifted up with them; be not highminded, or filled with pride and
vanity on account of them; nor put any trust in them, for they are
uncertain things. Jarchi interprets it of the increase of the riches of
others; see [Psa 49:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#016.md).

[Psalms 62:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 62:11</span></span>

God hath spoken once,.... One word of his is more to be confided in, and
depended on, than all the men and things in the world. The meaning is
not that God hath only spoke once; he has spoke often; he spoke all
things out of nothing in creation; he spoke all the words of the law at
Mount Sinai; he spoke by the prophets under the Old Testament
dispensation, and by his Son in the last days, and still by the
ministers of the Gospel: but the sense is, that what God has once spoken
stands; it is irreversible and immutable; it is firm, sure, and
unalterable; he does not repent, he cannot lie, nor will he alter the
thing that is gone out of his lips; and therefore his word is to be
trusted to, when men of high degree are a lie;

twice have I heard this; that is, many times, as Kimchi explains it: the
Targum refers this, and the preceding clause, to the delivery of the
law:

"one law God spake, and twice we heard it from the mouth of Moses the
great scribe;''

but the meaning is, that the psalmist had heard of two things, and was
well assured of the truth of them, and which were the foundation of his
trust and confidence; one is mentioned in this verse and the other in
[Psa 62:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#012.md); the first is,

that power belongeth unto God; great power, even almighty power, as
appears from the creation of all things out of nothing, the preservation
of them in their beings, the government of the world, the redemption of
his people by Christ, the work of grace upon their hearts by his Spirit,
the perseverance of the saints, their deliverance from their enemies,
and the destruction of them. The ancient Cabalists (n) among the Jews
have endeavoured, from this passage, to establish a Trinity in unity,
they speak of

"three superior "Sephirot", or numbers; and of them it is said, "God
hath spoken once, twice have I heard this": once and twice, lo, the
three superior numbers, of whom it is said, one, one, one, three ones;
and this is the meaning of "God hath spoken once, twice have I heard
this; this" in it makes them one.''

[Psalms 62:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 62:12</span></span>

Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy,.... This is the other thing the
psalmist had heard, and was assured of, and which encouraged his hope
and trust in the Lord; that mercy belonged to him, [Psa
130:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#007.md); as appears, not only from the
common bounties of his providence, daily bestowed upon his creatures;
but from the special gift of his Son, and of all spiritual mercies and
blessings in him; from the regeneration of the Lord's people, the pardon
of their sins, and their eternal salvation;

for thou renderest to every man according to his work; and which is a
reason proving that both power and mercy belong to God; power in
punishing the wicked according to their deserts, and mercy in rewarding
the saints, not in a way of merit, or of debt, but of grace. Some
interpret the words, as Aben Ezra and Kimchi observe, "though thou
renderest", &c. that is, God is gracious and merciful, though he is also
just and righteous in rendering to every man as his work is, whether it
be good or evil.
