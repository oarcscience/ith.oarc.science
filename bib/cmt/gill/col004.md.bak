INTRODUCTION TO COLOSSIANS 4

This chapter begins with an exhortation to masters to behave towards
their servants in a just and equitable manner, from the consideration of
their having a master in heaven, which should have concluded the
preceding one; and in it the apostle gives some general exhortations,
and some particular instructions about reading this, and another
epistle, and stirring up their minister to his duty; and great part of
it is taken up in expressing his love to the Colossians, and in the
salutations of others, and of himself. The general exhortations are to
prayer, with watchfulness and thankfulness, not only for themselves, but
especially for the ministers of the Gospel, [Col
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#002.md) and next to a wise behaviour
towards them that were of the world, [Col
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#005.md) and also to a prudent
conversation, particularly in language, with everyone, [Col
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#006.md). And then the apostle proceeds to
declare his great affection for them, and care of them, which he showed
by sending two proper persons to them from him, partly to make known his
affairs to them, and partly to know the state and condition they were
in, and comfort them, [Col 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#007.md) and
next follow the salutations of various persons to them, who are
mentioned by name, and whose characters are given, [Col
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010.md). And then he orders them to read
this epistle in the church of Laodicea, and also that which came from
that place, [Col 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#016.md) and to admonish
Archippus to take heed to, and fulfil his ministry, since it was what he
had received in the Lord, [Col 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#017.md).
And then closes the epistle with his own salutation and benediction,
entreating a remembrance of him and his bonds, [Col
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#018.md).

[Colossians 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">col 4:1</span></span>

Masters, give unto your servants,.... This verse properly belongs to the
preceding chapter, with which it should have been concluded. It is
indeed strange, that those who made the division of chapters and verses
should separate this from the former chapter, to which it so manifestly
belongs, and begin a new one with it, when it has no connection with
what follows; for the apostle having observed the duty of servants to
their masters, proceeds to direct masters to the discharge of their duty
to their servants, by giving them

that which is just and equal: proper food and raiment, which is
sufficient and fitting for them; the wages due unto them by law or
contract; using them with gentleness and humanity, taking care of them
when under affliction, and in sickness; encouraging the diligent and
laborious by an addition to their salaries; correcting the disobedient
within just bounds, not with too much rigour and severity; and carrying
it with an even hand to all, not preferring or indulging one before
another, without any reason:

knowing that ye also have a master in heaven: See Gill on [Eph
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#009.md).

[Colossians 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">col 4:2</span></span>

Continue in prayer,.... This is not said particularly to masters, as in
the foregoing verse, but to all the members of the church in general;
for the apostle having taken notice of some special duties relating to
persons in different stations of life, returns to such as were common to
them all; as this of prayer to God is, for such prayer is intended; for
though the object is not expressed here, he is in the following verse,
and the Mediator Christ is supposed, and also the Holy Spirit, whose
assistance is necessary to it. The things exhorted to, and required in
prayer, are, first, as in this clause, continuance in it, which does not
mean that men should be always formally praying to God; nor can it be
thought that saints are always in praying frames of soul, though such
are always desirable; but it intends frequency and constancy in prayer,
in opposition to an entire restraint and omission of it, and to a
performance of it but now and then, or very rarely; for though
Christians are not, as the Jews were, bound to certain stated hours of
prayer, so many times in a day, yet a day should not pass without prayer
to God; for their daily cases call for it; their lives, their health,
their daily bread, and all their temporal enjoyments, which depend on
his daily goodness, providence, and power; their spiritual affairs, the
renewing of the inward man day by day, fresh supplies of grace for new
service; their daily trials and afflictions, their continued enemies,
sin, Satan, and the world, all fully show the necessity of daily prayer:
besides, God does not always immediately answer the prayers of his
people, he will be sought unto time after time, even for a blessing he
intends to give; and therefore the saints should not be discouraged, but
continue in prayer till they receive the mercy, and their importunity is
a means of enjoying it, as in the case of the poor widow; and which is
an encouraging reason why men should pray always, and not faint. Add to
this, that constant prayer is a means of keeping up a spiritual
acquaintance, intercourse, and familiarity with God, and of the soul
alive in the vigorous exercise of the graces of the Spirit, and of
preserving the saints from temptations and sin; for, generally speaking,
restraining prayer before God, and casting off his fear, go together.
The next things requisite in prayer are watchfulness and thankfulness:

and watch in the same with thanksgiving. There is not only a
watchfulness unto it, previous to a man's entrance on it, as in [Eph
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#018.md) but a watchfulness in it, which
is opposed both to sleepiness of body, and to coldness and indifference
of mind, to all careless airs and negligent manner of performing it; and
designs an intenseness of mind, an application of thought, and fervency
of devotion, and affection in it. It lies in a concern, that the heart
be lift up, with the hands to God; in a care, that what is asked is
according to the will of God, and that the whole be performed in
sincerity, faith, and fear. This is what the Jews call , "the attention
of prayer" (f), and , "the intention of the heart"; and which, they say
(g), is the root of prayer, the main and principal thing in it; and that
every prayer which is not with intention, is no prayer (h); and which,
they observe, lies in this, that a man turns his heart from all (other)
thoughts, and seems to himself as if he stood before the divine Majesty.
To this

thanksgiving must be added; see [Phi
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#006.md) for this is well pleasing to God;
and the contrary, an ungrateful spirit, is highly resented by him.
Besides, a believer has always mercies to bless God for, as well as
favours to ask at his hands; nor is he ever in such a situation, either
in temporals or spirituals, but he has something to bless God for.
Moreover, how should it be expected that a person should succeed in a
present request, who is not thankful for a former kindness?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">col 4:3</span></span>

Withal, praying also for us,.... The persons to be prayed for are next
directed to; and these are not only themselves, though their concern is
very near and great, but others also, all the saints and people of God,
yea, all men, and in particular the ministers of the Gospel. The apostle
desires they would pray for him, and his fellow ministers, and which he
says not in dissimulation, under a guise of humility, but in true
humility and lowliness of mind; being sensible of the greatness of the
ministerial work, which this shows, and of his own imperfection and
weakness, and of what advantage the prayers, even of the meanest in the
church, might be unto him: and this shows, that it is the duty of
churches, and of particular believers, to pray for their ministers, and,
among the rest, as follows,

that God would open to us a door of utterance; or "of the word"; so the
Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic; and Ethiopic versions; meaning, either
the word of the Gospel, that the door of that might be opened, that it
might have a free course, and be glorified; for though he was bound,
that was not; nor does he desire that the door of the prison might be
opened, but the door of the word; that there might be an opportunity of
preaching it; in which sense this phrase is used, [Co1
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#009.md) that whereas he could not go
abroad to preach it, the hearts of men might be inclined to come to him,
and hear it from his mouth; and that the door of their hearts might be
opened, that they might attend unto it; that it might have an entrance
into them, and a place in them: or else the door of his own speech and
words is intended, and the sense be, that God would not only set before
him an open door for the preaching of the Gospel, and make it effectual
for the conversion of many souls; but that, as he would furnish him with
all abilities, and every gift for that service, so that with enlargement
of heart, and liberty of mind, he would give him elocution, a mouth and
wisdom to speak, utterance and freedom of speech; that the door of the
Gospel being opened, or an opportunity given to preach it, and the door
of men's hearts opened to receive it, the door, of his lips might be
also opened to show forth the praise of the grace of God. The
Alexandrian copy adds, "with boldness", or "boldly", as in [Eph
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#019.md)

to speak the mystery of Christ; the Gospel, of which Christ is the
author, preacher, sum, and substance; the whole of which is a mystery;
the wisdom of God in a mystery; all the doctrines of it are mysteries;
and particularly those, and which are here more especially designed,
which regard the person, offices, and grace of Christ, as the mystery of
his divine and eternal sonship, of his incarnation, of the union of the
two natures, divine and human, in his person, of redemption by his
blood, justification by his righteousness, and satisfaction by his
sacrifice, things dear to the apostle, and which his soul was full of,
and he wanted to speak out; and therefore desires prayer, to be made for
him, that a door might be opened, and way made for his speaking of these
things with freedom:

for which, says he,

I am also in bonds; this he adds, partly to show how dear the Gospel was
to him, that he was willing to suffer, and did suffer cheerfully for the
sake of it; and what an honour he esteemed it to lie in chains for it,
of which, nor of that, was he in the least ashamed; and partly to stir
them up the more to prayer for him, for his liberty in every respect.

[Colossians 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">col 4:4</span></span>

That I may make it manifest,.... It being a mystery, a secret, which was
hid in God from everlasting, and, during the legal dispensation, was
wrapped up in types, and shadows, and sacrifices, and is still hidden
unto the natural man. Wherefore the apostle was desirous of making it
manifest in a ministerial way; for God only, by his Spirit, makes it
manifest in a spiritual, experimental, and saving way.

As, says he,

I ought to speak. The Arabic version adds, "concerning it", the Gospel,
the mystery of Christ. The apostle's meaning is, that he might deliver
it with that clearness and evidence, and use that plainness of speech
which became the Gospel, and him as a minister of it, and not ambiguous
expressions, equivocal phrases, words of double meanings, on purpose to
hide things from men, but by manifestation of the truth, to commend
himself to every man's conscience in the sight of God. As also to speak
it faithfully, declaring the whole counsel of God, keeping back nothing
that might be profitable to the churches; and with all constancy and
certainty, with all boldness and intrepidity of soul, and freedom of
mind; not seeking to please men, aiming at vain glory, and popular
applause, or being afraid of their faces, menaces, and reproaches.

[Colossians 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">col 4:5</span></span>

Walk in wisdom,.... Or wisely, circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise
men; See Gill on [Eph 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#015.md).

Towards them that are without; so the Jews used to call the Gentiles,
all that were out of their own land, that were not of their nation or
religion, who were aliens from them, and strangers to their privileges;
and sometimes the unbelieving. Jews bear the same character, see [Mar
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#011.md). Here it may design such who were
not members of this church; so the distinction of those that are
without, and such as are within, is used by the apostle in [Co1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#012.md). A church is an house or family,
and such as belong to it are called the household of faith, and those
that do not are they that are, without; it is as a city, and, those that
are of it are fellow citizens with the saints, but others are strangers
and foreigners; it is a garden enclosed, they that are planted in it are
those that are within, and such as lie in the wide open field of the
world are those that are without: but inasmuch as there are some who are
not members of churches, and yet have the grace of God, this phrase may
chiefly regard all unregenerate men, profane sinners, such as have not
faith in Christ, nor hope in God, who are entirely destitute of the
grace of God. Now it becomes saints to walk wisely towards them; all
communication with them is not cut off, or correspondence and
conversation with them forbidden; the saints indeed are not to have
their conversation among them as in times past; they are to have no
fellowship with them in immoral actions, and superstitious practices;
but they may be concerned with them in things civil, with respect to
trade and commerce, and the common business of life; on these accounts
they may keep company with them; otherwise, as the apostle elsewhere
says, they must needs go out of the world. But then it is incumbent upon
them to behave wisely towards them, with the simplicity of the dove to
join the wisdom of the serpent; they should walk inoffensively towards
them, and do nothing to provoke them, to injure and persecute them, but
take all prudent methods to gain their affections, escape their
resentment and wrath, and obtain their liberty of worshipping God
without disturbance; they should give to all their due, tribute, custom,
fear, and honour, to whom they are due, and owe no man anything but
love; they should submit to every ordinance of men and be subject to the
higher powers, not only to escape wrath, but for conscience sake, and
should give to Caesar the things that are Caesar's; they should pray for
kings, and all in authority; for the prosperity of the nation, city, and
place where they are, for their carnal relations and neighbours, and
even their very entities, and do them all the good, both for soul and
body, that lies in their power, and as they have opportunity; and by so
doing, they will heap up coals of fire on their heads. Such a prudent
walk, and wise conduct, is necessary on account of the Gospel, that the
public ministration of it may be continued, that it may spread and get
ground, and that it may not be reproached and blasphemed; and on the
account of them that are without, that they may not have any
stumblingblocks laid in their way, and they be hardened in their impiety
and irreligion, and be more set against the truths of the Gospel; and
also on account of believers themselves, who ought so to converse with
the men of the world, that they are not partakers with them in their
sins, and have their manners corrupted by them, or the vital heat of
religion damped, and they become dead, lifeless, lukewarm, and
indifferent to divine things, which is often the case through an
indiscreet and imprudent walk with such men: the apostle adds,

redeeming the time; as an instance of prudent walking towards them that
are without; See Gill on [Eph 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#016.md).

[Colossians 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">col 4:6</span></span>

Let your speech be always with grace,.... "In grace, or concerning
grace": let grace be the subject matter of your speech and conversation.
When saints meet together they should converse with each other about the
work of grace upon their souls, how it was begun, and how it has been
carried on, and in what case it now is; they should talk of the great
things and wonders of grace, which God has done for them, which would be
both comfortable and edifying to them, and make for the glory of the
grace of God; and also, they should confer together about the doctrines
of grace, and so instruct, establish, and build up one another in them;
and at least their conversation should always turn on things graceful
and acceptable, such as may minister grace unto the hearer, and be
useful and edifying; wherefore all obscene words, unchaste expressions,
filthiness, foolish talking, and jesting, ought not to be used. Or this
may regard the manner of the speech, and language of the saints; it
should be in the exercise of grace; it should be in truth, faithfulness,
and sincerity, without lying, dissimulation, and flattery; it should be
in consistence with the grace of love, therefore evil should not be
spoken one of another; nor should there be whisperings, backbitings, or
anything said that is injurious to the character, credit, and reputation
of another; for this is contrary to love, and so not with grace: and
whatever is said should be spoken in the fear of God; the reason why so
many evil things proceed out of the mouths of men is, because the fear
of God is not before their eyes. Moreover, the speech of the saints
ought to be in a graceful way, with a cheerful and pleasant countenance,
in an affable and courteous manner, and not after a morose, churlish,
and ill natured fashion: and this should be "alway" the case; not that
they should be always talking, for there is a time to keep silence, as
well as a time to speak; but the sense is, that when they do speak, it
should be both graceful things, and in a graceful manner; so that there
is never any room and place for vain discourse, unprofitable talk, and
idle words, which must all be accounted for in the day of judgment.

Seasoned with salt. The Syriac version adds, "as" and reads it, "as if
it was seasoned with salt": grace being that to speech, as salt is to
meat; as salt makes meat savoury and agreeable to the palate, so grace,
prudence, and holiness, which may be meant by salt, see [Mar
9:50](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#050.md), make discourse savoury,
pleasant, and acceptable to a spiritual man, who savours the things that
be of God, as all such things are that relate to the grace of God, the
work or doctrines of it; and as salt preserves flesh from putrefaction
and corruption, so when grace goes along with speech, it makes it pure
and incorrupt, sound speech which cannot be condemned: and the apostle's
view is, in this exhortation, that nothing unsavoury and corrupt proceed
out of the mouths of believers; see [Eph
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#029.md),

that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man. The Syriac and Arabic
versions render it, "and know ye how", &c. and make it to be a fresh
exhortation to the saints to be concerned for such a share of spiritual
knowledge, that they may be able to give a proper and pertinent answer,
with meekness and fear, to such as shall ask a reason of the hope that
is in them; and to make suitable returns to persons according to their
age, sex, capacities, and circumstances; for everyone is not to be
answered alike, nor the same man under different circumstances; a fool
is sometimes to be answered according to his folly, and sometimes not;
and this seems to be a better reading than ours, which makes this to be
the end of gracious, savoury, and incorrupt speech; whereas knowledge is
not acquired by speaking, but ought to go before it; though indeed a
person that uses himself to speaking with prudence, purity, and grace,
is at all times ready to give an agreeable answer, in a graceful and
acceptable manner, to everyone.

[Colossians 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">col 4:7</span></span>

All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you,.... This Tychicus was an
Asian by birth; see [Act 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004.md). His
name signifies "fortunate", and is the same with "Fortunatus" in Latin,
which name is mentioned in [Co1 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#017.md)
whether he is the same person may be inquired. It is said that this
Tychicus was one of the seventy disciples, and was afterwards bishop of
Chalcedon. However, he was employed by the apostle as a messenger to
Colosse, as he also was to Ephesus, see [Eph
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#021.md), to inform the members of the
church of his state and condition, how it was with him; as that he was
in prison at Rome, for the sake of the Gospel, which he continued to
abide by, and held fast the profession of, not being in the least moved
and intimidated by what he suffered, being supported by the presence of
Christ, and the discoveries of his love; and therefore, though his
outward state was very mean and uncomfortable, yet the inward state of
his soul was right and good; the inward man was renewed day by day. He
might also send word by him what his thoughts were about his
deliverance, or his dissolution, and what expectation he had of either
of these: and that they might give the greater credit to what Tychicus
should relate from him, he gives him the following character,

who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister: the same character is
given of him in [Eph 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#021.md); see Gill on
[Eph 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#021.md) to which is here added,

and fellow servant in the Lord; he was a "brother" in Christ, being a
partaker of the same grace, and in the same spiritual relation; and
"beloved" of God, and Christ, of all the churches and saints that knew
him, and especially by the apostle; and was also a "minister" of the
Gospel, a preacher of Jesus Christ, and a "faithful" one to Christ, to
his Gospel, and the souls of men; than which a greater character cannot
well be given: and though the apostle was endued with such superior
gifts, grace, and usefulness; yet he calls this ministering brother a
"fellow servant in the Lord"; he having a commission to preach from the
same Lord, and having the same Gospel intrusted with him, and being
engaged in the same good work, and having the same ends in view, the
glory of Christ, and the good of souls; though he had not equal
abilities and qualifications, and was not in the same high post and
office as an apostle of Jesus Christ.

[Colossians 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">col 4:8</span></span>

Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose,.... That is, to relate
to them his affairs both temporal and spiritual; and also,

that he might know your estate. The Arabic version renders it, "that I
may know your estate" by him when he returned again; as whether they
continued steadfast in the Gospel, and observed the order, ordinances,
and discipline of it; how it prospered, and was succeeded among them, to
their comfort and edification, and to the conversion of others; and what
reception the false teachers had among them; and what love, concord, and
harmony were among themselves; or what were their afflictions and
distresses from their enemies. The Ethiopic version renders it, "that ye
may know the history of me"; which agrees with a manuscript mentioned by
Grotius, which reads, "that ye may know the things concerning us", as
does the Alexandrian copy; and with [Eph
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#022.md) where it is added, as here, and
"comfort your hearts"; who might be greatly cast down upon hearing of
the sufferings of the apostle, and also with those they themselves
endured both from within and from without, from sin, Satan, and the
world;

see on Gill [Eph 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#022.md).

[Colossians 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">col 4:9</span></span>

With Onesimus,.... Who had been Philemon's servant, ran away from him,
and was met with and converted by the Apostle Paul, of whom he says many
things in his epistle to his master. According to the Apostolic
Constitutions, he was afterwards bishop of Beyrhoea; and some say he
suffered martyrdom under Domitian; a servant of this name is mentioned
by Suetonius (i), Ignatius (k) speaks of one Onesimus as bishop of
Ephesus, but not the same with this,

a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you; either one of their
ministers, as Epaphras was, [Col 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012.md)
or one of their city, who was originally a native of that place; and
which the apostle mentions, the more to recommend him; though this is
the least part of his commendation; he calls him a "brother", being both
a converted man, and in the ministry; and being faithful in his work to
Christ, and greatly beloved, by the saints; and particularly highly in
the esteem and affections of the apostle:

they shall make known unto you all things which are done here; at Rome,
either to him in prison, or in the church; and being two of them, were a
proper number to bear a testimony, and which ought to be received.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">col 4:10</span></span>

Aristarchus my fellow prisoner saluteth you,.... This man was a man of
Macedonia, and a Thessalonian; [Act
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#029.md) which hinders not but that he
might be of the circumcision, or a Jew, as is suggested in the following
verse; for he might be born at Thessalonica, and yet be of Jewish
parents; nor is his Greek name any objection to it, for the Jews
themselves say, that the greatest part of the Israelites that were out
of the land, their names are as the names of strangers (l): he was a
constant companion of the apostle, and one of his fellow labourers, as
in [Plm 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#024.md) and now a prisoner with
him at Rome; and who having some knowledge of the members of the church
at Colosse, takes this opportunity of sending his Christian salutation
to them:

and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas; the same with John Mark, whose
mother's name was Mary, said here to be sister to Barnabas, [Act
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#012.md) concerning whom there was a
difference between Paul and Barnabas, [Act
15:37](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#037.md), and is the same Mark that wrote
the Gospel, and was converted by the Apostle Peter, [Pe1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#013.md) and who is said to have received
his Gospel from him; he is also mentioned [Ti2
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#011.md) . The Arabic version calls him
here, the "brother's son of Barnabas": and the Syriac version, , "his
uncle's son": however, Barnabas being so great a man as he was, and so
well known, it added some credit to Mark, that he was a relation of his:

touching whom ye received commandments; not concerning Barnabas, but
Mark, concerning whom they had had letters of commendation, either from
Barnabas or from Paul, to this purpose:

if he come unto you, receive him; for this was either the substance of
those letters, or what the apostle now adds of his own, for the further
confirmation of them; and that they might more readily and honourably
receive him, when he should come unto them.

And Jesus, which is called Justus,.... The former of these names is the
same with Joshua, and was very frequent with the Jews, and the later a
surname that was sometimes given to men remarkable for holiness and
righteousness: so Joseph, called Barsabas, is surnamed Justus, [Act
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#023.md) and James, the brother of our
Lord, was called by the Jews James the Just (m): whether this man was
not the same with Justus of Corinth, whose house joined to the
synagogue, and into which Paul entered, [Act
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#007.md) is not certain, but is likely:
who are of the circumcision; were Jews, were circumcised persons, though
not now sticklers for circumcision, and the rest of the ceremonies, as
appears by what follows: this is to be understood of all the above
persons, that sent their salutations to this church; though some confine
it to Marcus, Barnabas's sister's son, and to Jesus, called Justus:

these only are my fellow workers unto the kingdom of God; who assisted
him in preaching the Gospel of the kingdom of God, and in promoting the
honour and interest of Christ. These were the only persons of the Jewish
nation that were then at Rome under that character; from whence it
appears that Peter was not there at that time: the apostle adds,

which have been a comfort unto me; under his afflictions and sufferings,
by visiting him, conferring with him, praying for him, communicating to
him, and labouring in the Gospel in his room and stead.

Epaphras, who is one of you,.... A native of Colosse, and one of their
faithful ministers; see [Col 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#007.md).

A servant of Christ; not merely in the same sense as every believer is,
but as he was a preacher of the Gospel, in which he faithfully served
his Lord and master, Christ:

saluteth you; sends his Christian respects to you, for whom he bore a
sincere love and hearty affection, as appears by what follows:

always labouring fervently for you in prayers; in all his prayers, which
were many and frequent, he never forgot his dear flock at Colosse, of
which he was pastor, but strove with God for them, even to an agony, as
the word signifies; he wrestled with the Lord as Jacob did, nor, as he,
would he let him go without a blessing for this church; he was
incessant, importunate, and fervent in prayer for them: and what he
prayed in particular for them was,

that ye may stand perfect; in Christ Jesus their head, and in his
spotless righteousness; see [Col 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#028.md)
and continue believing in him, and looking to him for righteousness and
strength, in whom all the fulness, the perfection of grace dwells; and
where the saints only are, and can continue to be perfect:

and complete in all the will of God; or "be filled" in it, have a
perfect knowledge of the revealed will of God, both as to doctrine and
practice, and be enabled to act according to it.

For I bear him record,.... The apostle was an eye and ear witness of his
fervent prayers, his labour of love, and zealous affection for these
saints and others; and therefore, as he judged he ought, he bears a
testimony for him,

that he hath a great zeal for you; for their spiritual welfare, that the
Gospel might continue with them, and they in that, against false
teachers, and their attempts to subvert them; that they might grow in
the grace of the Gospel, and walk worthy of it, and be at peace among
themselves:

and them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis; cities in
Phrygia, which lay near to Colosse, the one being situated by the river
Lycus, and the other by the Maeander; here were many believers, for whom
Epaphras had a like zeal and affections as for the Colossians, and to
whom very likely he had been useful, either in conversion or
edification, or both. The apostle takes no notice to the Colossians of
Epaphras being his fellow prisoner, as, he does in his epistle to [Plm
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#023.md) it may be for this reason, lest
they should be over much distressed and cast down with it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">col 4:14</span></span>

Luke, the beloved physician,.... Luke the Evangelist, though some doubt
it, is here intended, who was a constant companion of the apostle in his
troubles, and went with him to Rome, as the Acts of the Apostles wrote
by him show, and as from [Ti2 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#011.md) it
appears; so Jerom (n) calls the Evangelist Luke, the physician of
Antioch, for from thence he was; and being converted by the Apostle
Paul, as is very probable, though some make him to be one of the seventy
disciples, he became of a physician of bodies, a physician of souls:
some say (o) he was a scholar of Galen, the famous physician, and others
that he was his sister's son; who having heard of Christ's miracles, set
out with his master Galen for Judea, to know the truth of them, of which
they doubted; Galen died by the way, Luke came to Christ, and being
taught by him, became one of the seventy disciples. The apostle calls
him "beloved", not on account of his profession, in which he might be
useful to many, but as he was a brother in Christ, a minister of the
Gospel, and a fellow labourer of his. This is the same person as Lucas,
mentioned along with Demas, and others, as here, in [Plm
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#024.md). The name perhaps is Roman, but
was, however, well known among the Jews; for they say (p), the

"witnesses that sign a divorce, and their names are as the names of
strangers, what is to be done with it? there is none comes into our
hands (is received) but "Lukus" and "Lus", and we allow it to be
right:''

upon which the gloss says, because these were famous names:

and Demas greet you; the same who, through the love of the present
world, forsook the apostle, [Ti2 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#010.md)
which he did either after the writing of this epistle, or if before it,
he was now returned again to him: his name seems to be the same with the
Roman Dama, unless it should be a contraction of Demetrius, or rather of
Demarchos; though the Jews make frequent mention of R. "Dimi", or
"Demi", in their writings (q), which perhaps is the same name with this.

Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea,.... Where there was a church
mentioned in the following verse, of which see on Gill [Rev
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#010.md).

And Nymphas; which some, unskilful in the Greek language, have took for
a woman; whereas it is the name of a man, as the following words show;
and is a contraction of Nymphios, or Nymphidios, or Nymphodoros:

and the church which is in his house. This man seems to have been an
inhabitant of Laodicea, and that the church there met at his house to
worship God, to pray unto him, sing his praise, hear his word, and
attend on all ordinances: or his own family was brought up so strictly
to the observance of these things, that they looked like a little church
of themselves.

[Colossians 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">col 4:16</span></span>

And when this epistle is read amongst you, Which the apostle was now
writing, and sent unto them; and which was to be read publicly, before
the whole church; being sent not to any particular person, or persons,
but to the whole body, and for their general good and instruction:

cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; his will
was, that after it had been read to the church at Colosse, it should be
sent, or at least a copy of it, to the church of the Laodiceans, in
order to be read there: his reason might be, not only because this
church was near them, but because it was in much the same situation,
being infested with the same sort of false teachers; and therefore what
was said to the one, was pertinent to the other:

and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea; which was not an
epistle of the apostle to the Laodiceans, as some have thought, but one
that was "written from" thence, as the Syriac version renders it.
Marcion, the heretic, called the epistle to the Ephesians, the epistle
to the Laodiceans, but without any reason; and others have forged an
epistle which bears this name, and appears to be a collection out of
others, and chiefly from the epistle to the Philippians; and which being
short, and may gratify the curious who cannot otherwise come at it, I
shall transcribe it, and is as follows (r).

"Paul an Apostle, not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ; to
the brethren which are of Laodicea, grace be unto you, and peace from
God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. I give thanks to Christ in
every prayer of mine, that ye continue and persevere in good works,
expecting the promise in the day of judgment: neither let the vain
speeches of some that pretend to truth disturb you, so as to turn you
from the truth of the Gospel which is preached by me; and now the Lord
cause that those who belong to me may be serviceable for the furtherance
of the truth of the Gospel, and doing kind actions, which are of
salvation unto eternal life: and now my bonds are manifest which I
suffer in Christ, in which I am glad and rejoice; and this is to my
perpetual salvation which is done by your prayers, the Holy Ghost
supplying, whether by life or by death; for me to live is life in
Christ, and to die is joy; and he will do his own mercy in you, that ye
may have the same love, and be unanimous: therefore, most beloved, as ye
have heard of the presence of the Lord, so think ye, and do in fear, and
you shall have life for ever; for it is God that worketh in you; and
whatsoever ye do, do without sin; and what is best, most beloved,
rejoice in the Lord Jesus Christ, and take heed of all filth in all
gain; let your petitions be openly with God, be ye steadfast in the
sense of Christ: and whatsoever things are sound and true, and chaste
and just, and lovely, do; and what ye have heard and received retain in
the heart, and peace shall be with you. Salute all the brethren with an
holy kiss; all the saints salute you; the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
be with your spirit. Amen. Cause this to be read to the Colossians, and
that which is of the Colossians to you.''

Every one on reading it will easily see that it is a spurious piece, a
collection out of other epistles, and very ill put together: however,
the apostle here does not speak of any epistle written to the church of
Laodicea, but of one that was written from thence; which some think was
written by himself, and that he means his first epistle to Timothy,
which is said to be written from Laodicea; and the rather, because in
that the qualifications of the ministers of the Gospel are given; and
also suitable instructions for the discharge of their work, and so very
proper to be read in the presence of Archippus; who, from the following
verse, seems to have been remiss and negligent, and needed stirring up
to the performance of his office: but from [Col
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001.md) it appears, that the apostle had
not been at Laodices when he wrote this, and had not so much as seen any
of the faces of the brethren there in the flesh; it therefore seems
rather to be an epistle which was sent from Laodicea to him, or to the
Colossians; which having something in it very instructive and useful,
the apostle desires it might be publicly read.

[Colossians 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">col 4:17</span></span>

And say to Archippus,.... A name common among the Grecians. This person
the apostle calls his fellow soldier, in [Plm
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#002.md) and who was now the minister of
the Gospel at Colosse, his fellow minister, or co-pastor Epaphras, being
at Rome, and a prisoner there; though by some he is said to be the first
bishop of the Laodiceans, but it seems most likely that he now resided
at Colosse, and was their minister: who being negligent in his office,
they are called upon to say unto him,

take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord,

that thou fulfil it. The "ministry" he had, was not that of the office
of a deacon, as some have thought, but of a preacher of the word; and
this he had "received" gifts for, and was called unto it, and installed
in it; and that "in", and "by the Lord" himself, and to whom he was
accountable for it: and therefore it was incumbent on him to "fulfil
it"; by constantly preaching the word, and faithfully administering the
ordinances; by defending truth, detecting error, reproving vice,
visiting the sick, and comforting the feeble minded; taking heed in all
things to himself and doctrine, that he feed the whole flock of God with
wholesome food; and, as a wise and faithful steward, give to everyone
their portion of meat in due season: hence it appears, that when
ministers are negligent in the discharge of their duty, the church has a
power to admonish and exhort them to a diligent performance of it.

[Colossians 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">col 4:18</span></span>

The salutation by the hand of me Paul,.... After his amanuensis had
finished the epistle, he added his usual salutation to it with his own
hand, to prevent all counterfeits and impositions, and that the churches
to whom he wrote might be sure of the genuineness of his epistles; but
before he added it to it, he either wrote with his own hand, or ordered
to be written the following words,

remember my bonds; this he says, partly that they might be animated to
abide by the Gospel, for which, as he had told them before, [Col
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#003.md) that he was in bonds; and partly
to encourage them, by his example, patiently to endure what afflictions
and persecutions soever they should meet with, for the sake of it; as
also that they might be moved hereby, to remember him in their prayers,
that, if it was the will of God, he might be released, and be yet
further useful in preaching the Gospel; or however, that he might be
supported in his bonds, and cheerfully bear them, and remain steadfast
in his faith in Christ unto the end: and then follows the salutation,

grace be with you, Amen; which is common to all his epistles, and well
suits them; in which he so much displays the grace of God, as it is
expressed in the Gospel; and which his heart was full of, and earnestly
desired might be more largely manifested to, and bestowed upon the
saints. This epistle is said to be

written from Rome to the Colossians, by Tychicus and Onesimus; and
though the subscriptions of the epistles are not always to be depended
on, yet this seems to be right; that it was inscribed to the Colossians,
there is no doubt; and that it was written from Rome is clear enough,
since by several expressions it is plain that he was now a prisoner, and
in bonds; and that it was sent by Tychicus and Onesimus is more than
probable, from [Col 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#007.md).
