INTRODUCTION TO 1 KINGS 17

This chapter begins with a prophecy of Elijah, that there should be want
of rain for some years to come, and he is directed to go first to the
brook Cherith, where he should be fed by ravens, [Kg1
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#001.md), and afterwards he is sent to a
widow at Zarephath, where he, she, and her son, were supported for a
considerable time with a handful of meal, and a little oil in a cruse
miraculously increased, [Kg1 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#008.md),
whose son falling sick and dying, he restored to life, [Kg1
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#017.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 17:1</span></span>

And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead,.... Which
belonged partly to the Reubenites and Gadites, and partly to the
half-tribe of Manasseh on the other side Jordan, where this prophet
dwelt; but why he is called the Tishbite is not easy to say; what Kimchi
observes seems right, that he was at first of a city called Toshab, and
afterward's dwelt at Gilead; which city perhaps is the same with Thisbe,
in the tribe of Naphtali, the native place of Tobit,

"Who in the time of Enemessar king of the Assyrians was led captive out
of Thisbe, which is at the right hand of that city, which is called
properly Nephthali in Galilee above Aser.'' (Tobit 1:2)

and, if so, is an instance of a prophet, even the prince of prophets, as
Abarbinel calls him, coming out of Galilee, contrary to the suggestions
of the Jews, [Joh 7:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#052.md). R. Elias
Levita (l) observes, that after the affair of Gibeah an order was given
to smite the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead, [Jdg
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#008.md), and that as it is reasonable to
suppose some might escape, he thinks Elijah was one of them; and that
when this began to be inhabited again, they that returned were called
the inhabitants of Gilead, of whom Elijah was, who lived in those times,
being, as the Jews suppose, Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the son of
Aaron, see [Jdg 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#028.md), but that he
should be Elijah, and live to the times of Ahab, is beyond belief. By
Origen (m) he is said to be in Thesbon of Gilead; and by Epiphanius (n)
to be of Thesbis, of the land of the Arabians, Gilead bordering upon it:
the same

said unto Ahab; who perhaps had been with him before, and reproved him
for idolatry, warned him of the evil consequences of it, but to no
purpose, and therefore now threatened in a very solemn manner:

as the Lord God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand; he swears by the
living God, in whose presence he was, and to whom he appeals as the
omniscient God, whose minister and prophet he was, and in whose name he
came and spoke, and to whom he prayed; for standing was a prayer
gesture, and sometimes put for it; see Gill on [Mat
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#005.md) and it was at the prayer of Elijah
that rain was withheld, as follows, see [Jam
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#017.md).

there shall not be dew nor rain these years; for some years to come,
even three years and a half:

but according to my word; in prayer, or as he should predict, in the
name of the Lord.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 17:2</span></span>

And the word of the Lord came to him,.... The word of prophecy, as the
Targum; this shows that by word, in the former verse, he means the word
of the Lord by him:

saying; as follows.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 17:3</span></span>

Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward,.... From the place where he was,
being in danger from Ahab and Jezebel, provoked by his reproofs,
threatenings, and prophecies:

and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan; in some
wood or cave near it, or among the reeds and rushes that grew on the
banks of it; and Bochart (o) takes it to be the same with the river
Kanah, on the borders of Ephraim, which has its name from reeds, [Jos
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#008.md), and Cherith by anticipation,
from the prophet's being fed there; and Adrichomius (p) places this
brook in the tribe of Ephraim; though Fuller (q) in the half tribe of
Manasseh, beyond Jordan; but Bunting says (r) it runs from Mount Ephraim
between Bethel and Jericho, eight miles from Jerusalem towards the
north, and so, passing along towards the east, falls into Jordan.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 17:4</span></span>

And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook,.... The water of
that was to be his drink:

and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there; whereby he should be
provided with food to eat; by whom are meant not angels in the form of
ravens, as some; nor, as others, Arabians, for there were none of that
people near him; nor, as others, merchants, the word being sometimes
used of them, for this was not a likely method for privacy; nor, as
others, the inhabitants of a place called Oreb, or Orbo; so the Arabic
version calls them Orabimi; but we read of no such place near Jordan;
the Jews (s) speak of a city of this name near Bethshean, from whence
these Orebim came; and some of them (t) think they had their name from
Oreb, in [Jdg 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#025.md) it seems better to
interpret them of ravens, as we do, these creatures delighting to be in
solitary places, in valleys, and by brooks; nor need it be any objection
that they were unclean creatures by the law, since Elijah did not feed
upon them, but was fed by them; and supposing any uncleanness by touch,
the ceremonial law might be dispensed with in an extraordinary case, as
it sometimes was; though it is very remarkable that such creatures
should be employed in this way, which are birds of prey, seize on
anything they can, live on carrion, and neglect their own young, and yet
feed a prophet of the Lord; which shows the power and providence of God
in it. Something like this Jerom (u) relates, of a raven bringing a
whole loaf of bread, and laying it before the saints, Paulus and
Antonius.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 17:5</span></span>

So he went, and did according to the word of the Lord,.... Took his
journey eastward, and hid himself in the place directed to:

for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan; see
Gill on [Kg1 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#003.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 17:6</span></span>

And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and
flesh in the evening,.... For his breakfast and supper, the two
principal meals then in use; and as there were several employed, they
could bring a sufficiency in a short time for each meal; and these
provisions were ready prepared, the bread made and baked, and the flesh
boiled, broiled, or roasted; from whence they had it need not be
inquired after; the Jews say (w) they were fetched from Ahab's table,
and others from Jehoshaphat's, and others, as probable as any, from the
tables of the 7000 who had not bowed the knee to Baal:

and he drank of the brook; at his meals.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 17:7</span></span>

And it came to pass after a while,.... Or "at the end of days" (x),
perhaps a year, which sometimes is the sense of this phrase, see [Exo
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#010.md),

that the brook dried up; through the excessive heat, and for want of
supplies from the springs and fountains with which it was fed, and for
the following reason:

because there had been no rain in the land; from the time Elijah prayed
and prophesied; of this drought mention is made in profane history:
Menander, a Phoenician writer, speaks (y) of a drought in the times of
Ithobalus (the same with Ethbaal the father of Jezebel), which lasted a
whole year, and upon prayer being made there were thunder, &c.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 17:8</span></span>

And the word of the Lord came unto him,.... As before, after he had been
a year at the brook, and that was dried up:

saying; as follows.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 17:9</span></span>

Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell
there,.... This might be a trial of the prophet's faith, to be sent to
dwell in a place belonging to the Zidonians, among whom Jezebel had an
interest, being the daughter of their king, [Kg1
16:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#031.md), the place is so called, to
distinguish it from another Zarephath, [Oba
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#020.md), Kimchi interprets it, near to
Zidon, yet not as belonging to it, but of the land of Israel; though it
rather seems to be a Gentile city; it is called, in [Luk
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#026.md) Sarepta of Sidon; and also by
Pliny (z); according to Josephus (a), it was not far either from Sidon
or Tyre, and lay between them; it was three quarters of a mile from
Sidon; and so Mr. Maundrell (b) speaks of it as in the way from Sidon to
Tyre, and which is now called Sarphan; of which he says, the place shown
us for this city consisted only of a few houses, on the tops of the
mountains, within about half a mile from the sea; but it is more
probable the principal part of the city stood below in the space between
the hills and the sea, there being ruins still to be seen in that place
of a considerable extent; and a traveller into those parts many years
before him says (c), that he saw nothing of any building on the shore,
but some small houses in the place where formerly the town of Sarepta
did stand; and Bunting says (d), there are at this time but eight houses
in all the town, though by the ruins it seems to have been in times past
a very fair city; and another (e) observes, that it is about three miles
from Berytus:

behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee; not that
this was declared to the woman, or that she had any orders from the Lord
to support him; but that he had determined it in his mind, and would
take care in his providence that he should be supplied by her: this was
another trial of the prophet's faith, that he should be sent to a poor
widow woman for his support, and she a Gentile; but he that had been so
long fed by ravens, could have no reason to doubt of his being provided
for in this way.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 17:10</span></span>

So he arose, and went to Zarephath,.... Which, according to Bunting (f),
was one hundred miles from the brook Cherith:

and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was
there gathering sticks: perhaps out of an hedge just without the city
this shows her to be a poor woman, who had no other way of coming at
fuel but this, and no servant to fetch it for her: Bunting tells us,
that now before the gate of the city there is showed a certain chapel,
where they say Elias first spoke with the widow:

and he called to her, and said, fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in
a vessel, that I may drink; being thirsty through travelling, and
supposing this to be the woman he was directed to, made trial of her
this way; some render it, "in this vessel" (g), which he had with him,
and made use of at the brook Cherith.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 17:11</span></span>

And as she was going to fetch it,.... For she made no difficulty of
granting his request, but immediately set out to fetch him some water
from the city, or some spring close by, or her own house; being very
ready to do an hospitable act to a stranger, and especially to a good
man, and a prophet, as she might perceive by his habit he was, as it
seems by what follows:

and said, bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand; to eat
before he drank; this he said still further to try her whether she was
the person that was to sustain him, as well as in order to lead on to
more discourse with her.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg1 17:12</span></span>

And she said, as the Lord thy God liveth,.... Which shows her to be a
good woman, swearing by the living God, and him only, and that she took
Elijah to be a good man, and a prophet of the Lord:

I have not a cake; greater or less, not a morsel of bread in the house:

but a handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse; these
separate and unmixed, and not made into a cake, and dressed as she
intended to do with them:

and, behold, I am gathering two sticks; or a few, which would be
sufficient to bake such a quantity as her meal and oil would make; she
speaks by the figure "meiosis", which expresses less than what is meant,
as Ben Melech observes:

that I may go in and dress it for me, and my son, that we may eat it,
and die; having nothing more left, and no expectation of any elsewhere,
and the famine strong in the land; so that she could look for nothing
but death after this was eaten.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 17:13</span></span>

And Elijah said unto her, fear not,.... That she and her son should die,
it would not be the case:

go and do as thou hast said: mix her meal and her oil, and make a cake
thereof, and bake it:

but make thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after
make for thee and for thy son: which was not said from a selfish spirit
of the prophet, but to try the faith of the woman; and besides, as
Abarbinel observes, the prophet was not only hungry and thirsty through
his journey, and so required to be served first, but it was for the sake
of his sustenance, that the Lord would command a blessing on the meal
and oil; wherefore, if she dressed it for herself and her son first,
there would have been none left for the divine blessing to descend upon.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 17:14</span></span>

For thus saith the Lord God of Israel,.... Whom the prophet perceived
she had knowledge of, and faith in:

the barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail;
that is, the meal in the barrel, and the oil in the cruse, by an
hypallage, or change of words:

until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth; which was
assuring her the rain would be sent, and that the Lord, who had the sole
command of it, would send it; and that, until that time it should be
sent, she would have no lack of provisions, and therefore need not
scruple dressing for the prophet first.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 17:15</span></span>

And she went, and did according to the saying of Elijah,..... Made a
cake for him first, and brought it to him, which showed great faith in
the word of the Lord by him:

and she, and he, and her house, did eat; many days, a year at least, if
not two years, see [Kg1 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#007.md) the
widow, the prophet, and her family, lived upon the meal and oil so long;
we read but of one son, but she might have more.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 17:16</span></span>

And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail,
according to the word of the Lord, which he spake by Elijah. There being
a continual increase and supply of both, through the mighty power of God
working a continued miracle; just as the loaves and fishes were
increased while the disciples were eating, [Mat
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#019.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 17:17</span></span>

And it came to pass after these things,.... Not only after the
conversation that passed between the prophet, and the widow, but after
they had lived together many days, a year or years, upon the miraculous
provision made for them:

that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; that
is, the son of the widow woman in whose house the prophet dwelt; the
Jews say (h) this woman was the mother of Jonah, and that he was this
son of her's:

and his sickness was so sore that there was no breath left in him: it
was a sickness unto death, it issued in it; for that he was really dead
appears from all that follows.

\(h\) Pirke Eliezer, c. 33.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg1 17:18</span></span>

And she said unto Elijah, what have I to do with thee, O thou man of
God!.... As if she should say, it would have been well for me if I had
never seen thy face, or had any conversation with thee; this she said
rashly, and in her passion and agony, being extremely affected with the
death of her child, which made her forget and overlook all the benefits
she had received through the prophet's being with her:

art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?
to punish her for her former sins, she was conscious she had been guilty
of; for she supposed, that as it was by his prayer that the drought and
famine were come upon the land, so it was in the same way that her son's
death came, namely, through the prayer of the prophet.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 17:19</span></span>

And he said unto her, give me thy son, and he took him out of her
bosom,.... Where she had laid him, mourning over him; from thence the
prophet took him with her leave:

and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his
own bed; an upper room, which was his bedchamber; hither he carried him,
that he might be alone, and use the greater freedom both in his
expressions and gestures.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg1 17:20</span></span>

And he cried unto the Lord,.... Or prayed unto him, as the Targum, with
great vehemence and importunity:

and said, O Lord, my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow,
with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son? he pleads his interest in the
Lord, and makes use of it as an argument with him to hear his prayer; he
observes the character and condition of the woman, a widow, such as the
Lord has a compassionate regard for; and he urges the kindness of her to
him, with whom he had sojourned so long; and seems to represent the case
as an additional evil or affliction to him, as well as to the widow.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 17:21</span></span>

And he stretched himself upon the child three times,.... Or "measured
himself" (i) on it, or put himself into a posture in some respects equal
to the child; putting his mouth on its mouth, his eyes on its eyes, his
hands on its hands, as Elisha afterwards did in a like case, perhaps in
imitation of him, [Kg2 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#034.md), thereby
showing his great affection to the child, and in order to increase it
the more, and to make him the more fervent and importunate in his
prayers for its life; and hereby signifying also that he would if he
could infuse his breath and life into it, and warm it with his own heat:

and cried unto the Lord, and said, O Lord my God, I pray thee, let this
child's soul come into him again: which shows that the child was really
dead; and a proof this that the soul dies not with the body, but exists
in a separate state without it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 17:22</span></span>

And the Lord heard the voice of Elijah,.... In prayer, and answered it:

and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived; this is
the first instance of anyone being raised from the dead; this Satan has
imitated; hence the many fabulous stories with the Heathens of persons
being raised to life after death (k).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 17:23</span></span>

And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into
the house,.... Being come to life, he took it off of the bed in his
bedchamber, and brought it down to the lower part of the house, where
the woman was:

and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, see, thy son liveth;
which no doubt was to her great surprise, and was a wonderful instance
of divine power and goodness, and to which the apostle may have respect,
[Heb 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#035), Bunting (l.md) says, the
inhabitants of this place now take upon them to show the chamber wherein
the prophet Elias lived, when he raised the widow's child to life.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 17:24</span></span>

And the woman said to Elijah, now by this I know that thou art a man of
God,.... She took him to be one at his first coming to her; she was in a
great measure confirmed in it by the miracle of the barrel of meal and
cruse of oil; but upon the death of her son, which she was ready to
impute to the prophet, she was staggered at it; but now, by his
resurrection from the dead, was fully assured of it:

and that the word of the Lord in thy mouth is truth; she had known
before that what he said concerning the meal and oil not failing was
true; but now she was more and more convinced and assured that the God,
whose prophet he was, was the true God, and that the religion he
professed was the true religion, and he a true prophet, and that all his
prophecies would be exactly fulfilled.
