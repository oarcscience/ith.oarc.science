### [Hosea Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001.md)

[Hosea](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">hos 12:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO HOSEA 12

This chapter contains complaints and charges both against Israel and
Judah, and threatens them with punishment in case they repent not, which
they are exhorted to: and first Ephraim is charged with idolatry, vain
confidence in, and alliances with, foreign nations, [Hos
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001.md); and then the Lord declares he
has a controversy with Judah, and will punish the inhabitants of it for
their sins, [Hos 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#002.md); which are
aggravated by their being the descendants of so great a man as Jacob,
who got the advantage of his elder brother, had much power with God, and
received favours from him, and they also, [Hos
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#003.md); and therefore are exhorted to
turn to God, wait on him, and do that which is right and good, [Hos
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#006.md). Ephraim is again in his turn
charged with fraudulent dealing in trade, and with oppression, and the
love of it; and yet pretended he got riches by his own labour, without
wronging any, [Hos 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#007.md); nevertheless,
the Lord promises them public ordinances of worship, and joy in them,
and the ministry of his prophets, [Hos
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#009.md); though for the present they were
guilty of gross idolatry, [Hos 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#011.md);
which is aggravated by the raising of Jacob their progenitor from a low
estate, and the wonderful preservation of him, and the bringing of them
out of Egypt, [Hos 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#012.md); and the
chapter is closed with observing Ephraim's bitter provocation of God,
for which his reproach should return unto him, and his blood be left
upon him, [Hos 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#014.md).

[Hosea 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 12:1</span></span>

Ephraim feedeth on wind,.... Which will be no more profitable and
beneficial to him than wind is to a man that opens his mouth, and fills
himself with it: the phrase is expressive of labour in vain, and of a
man's getting nothing by all the pains he takes; the same with sowing
the wind, and reaping the whirlwind, [Hos
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#007.md); and so the Targum has it here,

"the house of Israel are like to one that sows the wind, and reaps the
whirlwind all the day;''

and this refers either to the worship of idols, and the calves in
particular, and the vain hope of good things promised to themselves from
thence; or to their vain confidence in the alliances and confederacies
they entered into with neighbouring nations; from which they expected
much, but found little:

and followed after the east wind; a wind strong and vehement, burning
and blasting, very noxious and harmful; so that, instead of receiving
any profit and advantage either by their idolatry or their covenants
with other nations, they were only in these things pursuing what would
be greatly to their detriment: or they would be no more able to attain
by such methods what they sought for, than they would be able to
overtake the east wind, which is a very swift and fleeting one; so that
this clause exposes their folly, in expecting good things from their
idols, or help from their neighbours;

he daily increaseth lies and desolation; while they multiplied idols,
which are lies fallacious and deceitful, and idolatrous rites and acts
of worship, they do but increase their desolation and ruin, which such
things are the cause of, and will certainly bring them unto; or, not
content with the daily increase of their idolatries among themselves,
they continually persecute, spoil, and plunder those who do not give
into their false worship: so the Targum,

"lies and spoil they multiply;''

idolaters are generally persecutors:

and they do make a covenant with the Assyrians: and gave tribute and
presents to their kings, as Menahem did to Pul, and Hoshea to
Shalmaneser, not to hurt them, and to help and assist them against their
enemies, and to strengthen their kingdom; see [Kg2
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#019.md);

and oil is carried into Egypt: one while they sent presents to the
Assyrians, to obtain their favour and friendship: and at another time to
the Egyptians; nay, they sent to So king of Egypt, at the same time they
were tributary to Assyria, and, conspiring against him, brought on their
ruin; and oil was a principal part of the present sent; for this was
carried not by way of traffic, but as a present: so the Targum,

"and they carried gifts to Egypt;''

see [Isa 57:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#009.md). The land of Israel,
being a land of oil olive, was famous for the best oil, of which there
was a scarcity in Egypt, and therefore a welcome present there, as
balsam also was; see [Gen 37:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#025.md).

[Hosea 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 12:2</span></span>

The Lord hath also a controversy with Judah,.... The two tribes of Judah
and Benjamin, as well as the ten tribes; for though they had ruled with
God, and had been faithful with the saints in the first times of the
apostasy of Israel; yet afterwards they sadly degenerated, and fell into
idolatry likewise, particularly in the time of Ahaz, in which Hosea
prophesied; and therefore the Lord had somewhat against them; nor would
he spare them, but reprove them by the prophets, and rebuke them in his
providences; bring them to his bar, and lay before them their evils, and
threaten them with punishment in case of impenitence, as follows:

and will punish Jacob according to his ways; all the posterity of Jacob,
whether Ephraim or Judah; those of the ten tribes, or of the two, who
all descended from Jacob: or, "will visit according to his ways" (s); if
right, and agreeably to the mind and word of God, in a way of grace and
mercy; but if wrong, crooked, and perverse, then in a way of punishment;
for visiting is used both ways:

according to his doings will he recompense him; as they were good or
bad; if good, will reward them with a reward of grace; if bad, with
vengeance. The Targum paraphrases it,

"according to his right works.''

[Hosea 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 12:3</span></span>

He took his brother by the heel in the womb,.... That is, Jacob took his
brother Esau by the heel, as he came forth from his mother's womb; the
history of it is in [Gen 25:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#025.md). It is
here observed, upon mentioning the name of Jacob in [Hos
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#002.md), meaning the posterity, of the
patriarch; but here he himself is intended, and occasionally taken
notice of, to show how very different his posterity were from him, and
how sadly degenerated; as well as to upbraid them with ingratitude,
whose ancestors, and they also, had received such and so many favours
from the Lord; Jacob the patriarch was a hero from the womb, but they
transgressors from it; this action of his observed was a presage and
pledge of his having the superiority of his brother, and of his getting
the birthright and blessing from him. So the Targum,

"prophet, say unto them, was it not said of Jacob, before he was born,
that he would be greater than his brother?''

see [Rom 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#011.md). In this action there
was something divine, miraculous, and preternatural; it was not the
effort of nature merely, but contrary to it, or at least above it; and
not done by chance, but ordered by the providence of God, as a
prediction and testification of his future greatness, and even of his
posterity's, in times yet to come, as Kimchi observes, who refers to
[Oba 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#018.md);

and by his strength he had power with God; the Targum is, with the
angel, as in [Hos 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#004.md); he is called a
man in the history of this event in [Gen
32:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#024.md); not that he was a mere man,
since he is here expressly called God, and afterwards the Lord God of
hosts; and there it is evident, from the context, he was a divine
Person, and no other than the Son of God; who, though not as yet
incarnate, appeared in a human form, as a presage of his future
incarnation; though this was not a mere apparition, spectre, or
phantasm, as Josephus (t) calls it; for it was not in a dream, or in a
visionary way, that this wrestling and striving was between this divine
Person in this form and Jacob, but in reality; it was a real substance
which the Son of God formed, animated, actuated, and assumed, for that
time and purpose, and then laid it aside; which touched Jacob, and he
touched that, laid hold on it, and held it fast, and strove with it, and
had power over it, and over God in it; even over him that is God over
all, the true God and eternal life, the Lord Jesus Christ; not a created
God, or God by office, but by nature; as the perfections that are in
him, and the works and worship ascribed to him, declare: now Jacob had
power over him "by his strength"; not by his natural strength; either of
his body, which could not have been equal to the strength of this human
body assumed for the time, as it was used and managed by a divine
Person, unless he had been extraordinarily assisted and strengthened; or
of his mind and soul, not by any spiritual strength he had of himself;
but by what he had from this divine Person, with whom he wrestled; who
put strength into him, and supported and increased the power and
strength of faith in prayer; so that he prevailed over him, and got the
blessing, for which reason his name was called Israel, [Gen
32:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#028.md).

[Hosea 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 12:4</span></span>

Yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed,.... This is repeated in
different words, not only for the confirmation of it, it being a very
extraordinary thing, and difficult of belief; but to direct to the
history here referred to, where the person Jacob prevailed over is
called a man, and here the angel; and so Josephus (u) calls him a divine
Person; not a created angel, not Michael, as the Rabbins say, unless the
Messiah is meant by him; nor Jacob's guardian angel, as Kimchi, every
man being thought by some to have one; and much less Esau's evil angel,
that was against Jacob, as Jarchi and Abarbinel; for of him he would
never have sought nor expected a blessing; but an uncreated Angel, the
Son of God, the same that went before the Israelites in the wilderness,
and that redeemed Jacob from all evil, [Gen
48:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#016.md); called an Angel, being so not
by nature, for he is superior to angels in both his natures, divine and
human; but by office, being sent to reveal the will of God, and to do
the work of God in the redemption and salvation of men; the same that is
called the Angel of the great council in the Greek version of [Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md); and the Angel of God's presence,
[Isa 63:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#009.md); and the Angel or messenger
of the covenant, [Mal 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001.md); the phrases
used denote, as before, the power and prevalence Jacob had with this
divine Person in prayer; whereby he obtained the blessing of him, even
deliverance from his brother Esau, as well as others respecting him and
his posterity;

he wept, and made supplication unto him; not the angel, entreating Jacob
to let him go, as Jarchi and Kimchi, and so some Christian interpreters;
who think that an angel in human form may be said to weep, as well as to
eat and drink; and the rather, since this angel was not the conqueror,
but the conquered; and since Christ, in the days of his flesh, both
prayed and wept, and shed tears; but the case here is different; and
though he was prevailed over, it was through his own condescension and
goodness: but rather Jacob is meant, as Abarbinel and others; who wept
not on account of the angel's touching his thigh, and the pain that
might put him to; for he was of a more heroic spirit than to weep for
that, who had endured so much hardship in Laban's service, in heat and
cold; and besides, notwithstanding this, he kept wrestling with him, and
afterwards walked, though haltingly: but he wept either because he could
not get out the name of the person he wrestled with; or rather the tears
he shed were for the blessing he sought of him; for it is joined with
his making supplication, and is expressive of the humble, yet ardent,
affectionate, fervent, and importunate request he made to obtain it; and
here we have another proof of the deity of Christ, in that supplication
was made to him, and he is here represented as the object of that part
of religious worship, prayer, as he often is in the New Testament. This
circumstance is not expressed in [Gen
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#001.md), though it may be gathered from
what is there said; however, the prophet had it by divine inspiration;
and the truth of it is not to be doubted of, being not at all
inconsistent with, but quite agreeable to, that history;

he found him at Bethel; either the angel found Jacob in Bethel, as he
did more than once, both before and after this time, [Gen
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#012.md); it is good to be in Bethel, in
the house of God; happy are those that dwell there, and are found there
living and dying, doing the will and work of God there: or rather Jacob
found God or the angel in Bethel; God is to be found in his own house,
there he comes and blesses with his gracious presence; here Christ the
Angel of his presence is; here he meets with his people, and manifests
himself unto them. There is in the words a tacit reflection on Israel,
or the ten tribes, that bore the name of Jacob; the patriarch found God
in Bethel, Christ the Angel of the Lord; but now, instead of him, there
was a calf set up in this place, Israel worshipped; and therefore it was
called Bethaven, the house of an idol, or iniquity, instead of Bethel,
the house of God;

and there he spake with us; not with Esau and his angel, concerning
Isaac's blessing of Jacob, as Jarchi; nor with Jacob and his angel, as
the father of Kimchi; nor with the prophet, and with Amos, to reprove
Israel there for the worship of the calves, as Kimchi himself; but with
all the Israelites, of whom the prophet was one; who were then in the
loins of Jacob, when he conversed with God, and God with him, at Bethel:
or, as Saadiah interprets it, "for us" for our sakes, on our account; or
"concerning us"; concerning the multiplication of Jacob's posterity, and
the giving the land of Canaan to them, as the Lord did at both times he
appeared to Jacob in Bethel; see [Gen
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#014.md); and it is in the house of God,
where Christ is as a son, that he speaks with and to his people, even in
his word and ordinances there.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 12:5</span></span>

Even the Lord God of hosts,.... The God Jacob had power over, the Angel
he prevailed with, to whom he made supplication with weeping, and who
spake with him and his in Bethel, is he whose name is Jehovah; who is
the true and living God, the Lord of hosts and armies both in heaven and
in earth; of all the angels in heaven, and the legions of them; and of
the church militant, and all the saints, who are the good soldiers of
Christ, his spiritual militia; and he is the Captain of the Lord's host,
and of their salvation, and to whom all the numerous hosts of creatures,
be they what they will, are subject: this is observed, to set off the
greatness of the person Jacob wrestled with, and his wondrous grace, in
condescending to be overpowered by him:

the Lord is his memorial: or his name, Jehovah, which belongs to this
angel, the Son of God, as to his divine Father; and which is expressive
of his divine existence, of his eternity and immutability; this is his
memorial, or the remembrancer of him; which puts his people in all ages
in remembrance of him, what he is, what an infinite, almighty, and all
sufficient Being he is; and he is always to be believed in, and trusted
to, and to be served, adored, and worshipped. The Targum adds, to every
generation and generation.

[Hosea 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 12:6</span></span>

Therefore turn thou to thy God,.... Judah, with whom the Lord had a
controversy, is here addressed and exhorted to return to the Lord, from
whom they had backslidden; and this is urged, from the consideration of
their being the descendants of so great a man as Jacob; whose example
they should follow, and make supplication to the Lord as he did; and
from this instance of their progenitor might encourage themselves, that
God, who was his God, and their God, would be gracious and merciful to
them, and that they should prevail with him likewise, and obtain the
blessing, and especially since he is the everlasting and unchangeable
Jehovah. Turning to the Lord, as it supposes a going astray from him, so
it signifies a turning from idols, and all vain confidences; and is done
by renewed acts of faith and trust in the Lord, and repentance towards
him; and cannot be performed aright without grace and strength from him,
of which Ephraim was sensible, [Jer
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#018.md); as well as the encouragement to
it is from a view of God as a covenant God, and as gracious and
merciful, So Aben Ezra interprets it of divine help, of turning by thy
God, that is, by the help and assistance of thy God; and, indeed,
conversion to God, whether at first, or after, is through his powerful
and efficacious grace. Kimchi explains it, "thou shalt rest in thy God"
(w); when want follows is performed, comparing it with [Isa
30:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#015.md). The Targum is,

"and thou shall be strong in the worship of thy God;''

keep mercy and judgment; or, "observe" (x) them to do them; to show
mercy to persons in misery, to the poor and indigent, which is what the
Lord desires and delights in, more than in ceremonial sacrifices; and is
a principal part of the moral law, as "judgment" is another; the
exercise of justice, both public and private; passing a righteous
sentence in courts of judicature, and doing that which is right between
man and man; owing no man anything, but giving to all their due; doing
no injury to any man's person, property, or character; which are fruits
meet for true repentance; and when they spring from faith and love, and
are done with a view to the glory of God, and good of men, are
acceptable to the Lord; these are the weightier matters of the law, [Mat
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023.md);

and wait on thy God continually; both in private prayer, and for an
answer to it, and in public worship and ordinances, in hope of meeting
with him, and enjoying his presence; for this takes in the whole of
religious worship, private and public, and all religious exercises, as
invocation of God, trust in him, and expectation of seed things from
him; and may have a respect to the Messiah, and salvation by him, and a
waiting for him and that; as Jacob did, and his posterity should, and
many of them were in this posture, before and at his coming; see [Gen
49:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#018.md); Agreeable to this the Targum
is,

"and wait for the redemption or salvation of thy God continually.''

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 12:7</span></span>

He is a merchant,.... Here is a change of person from "thou" to "he",
from Judah to Ephraim, who is said to be a "merchant"; and if that was
all, there is nothing worthy of dispraise in it; but he was a cheating
merchant, a fraudulent dealer, as appears by what follows: or he is
Canaan, or a Canaanite (y); more like a descendant of Canaan, by his
manners, than a descendant of Jacob. But the Canaanites dealing much in
merchandise, their name became a common name for a merchant, as a
Chaldean for an astrologer; and as the children of Israel possessed
their land, so they followed the same business and employment of life;
which, had they performed honestly, would not have been to their
discredit; but they were too much like the Canaanites, of whom
Philostratus (z) says, they were covetous and fraudulent; and this was
Ephraim's character. The Targum is,

"be you not as merchants;''

the balances of deceit are in his hand; he used false weights and
measures; made the ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsified the
balances by deceit; had wicked balances, and deceitful weights, and the
scant measure, which is abominable, [Amo
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#005.md); they pretended to weigh
everything exactly they bought or sold; but cheated either by sleight or
hand, holding the balances as they should not; or had one pair of scales
and weights to buy with, and another to sell by, contrary to the law of
God, [Lev 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#035.md);

he loveth to oppress; instead of keeping and doing mercy and justice,
they oppressed the poor, ground their faces, defrauded them of their
due, and by secret and private methods cheated them in their dealings
with them, and brought them to poverty and distress; and this they took
delight and pleasure in, which showed a want of a principle of honesty
in them, and that they were habituated to such a course of life, and
were hardened in it, and had no remorse of conscience for it, but rather
gloried in it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 12:8</span></span>

And Ephraim said, yet I am become rich,.... Notwithstanding they took
such unjust methods, as to use deceitful balances, they prospered in the
world, got abundance of riches; and therefore concluded from thence that
their manner of dealing was not criminal, at least not so bad as the
prophets represented to them; and so promised themselves impunity, and
that what they were threatened with would not come upon them; and, as
long as they got riches, they cared not in what manner; and inasmuch as
they prospered and succeeded in their course of trading, they were
encouraged to go on, and not fear any evil coming upon them for it.
According to Aben Ezra and Kimchi, the sense is, that they became rich
of themselves, by their own industry and labour, and did not acknowledge
that their riches, and power to get them, were of God. They gloried in
them as their own attainments; and which they had little reason to do,
since they were treasures of wickedness, and mammon of unrighteousness,
which in a day of wrath would be of no service to them;

I have found me out substance; they found ways and means of acquiring
great riches, and large estates, by their own wisdom and cunning, and
all for themselves, for their own use, to be enjoyed by them for years
to come; and they were reckoned by them solid and substantial things,
when a mere shadow, emptiness, and vanity; and were not to be employed
for their own use and advantage only, but should have been for the good
of others; nor were they to be attributed to their own sagacity,
prudence, and management, but to the providence of God, admitting they
had been got in ever so honourable and just a manner;

in all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that were sin:
here again Ephraim, or the people of Israel, vainly ascribe all their
wealth and riches to their own labour, diligence, and industry, and take
no notice of God and his providence, or of his blessing upon them; and
pretend to be very upright and honest in their dealings, and that what
they got were very honestly got, and would bear the strictest scrutiny;
and that if their course of trade was ever so narrowly looked into,
there would be nothing found that was very bad or criminal, that they
could be justly reproached the; only some little trifling things, that
would not bear the name of "sin", or deserve any correction or
punishment; so pure were they in their own eyes, so blinded and hardened
in sin, and fearless of the divine displeasure; like the adulterous
woman, wiped their mouths when they had eaten the sweet morsels of sin,
and said they had done no wickedness, [Pro
30:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#020.md); or which was involuntary, and
not done knowingly, as Kimchi and Abendana: or rather, as Ben Melech
renders it, "no iniquity and sin"; and so others: or, best of all, "no
iniquity or sin", as Noldius (a); no iniquity, or any kind of sin at
all. Thus, as Ephraim was charged before with idolatry and lies in
religion, so here with fraudulent dealings, and getting riches in an
illicit way in civil things; and of whose repentance and reformation
there was no hope.

[Hosea 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 12:9</span></span>

And I that am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt,.... Ephraim being
so very corrupt in things, both religious and civil, and so very
impenitent and impudent, is let alone to suffer the just punishment of
his sins; but Judah being called to repentance, and brought unto it,
gracious promises are here made unto him, to be fulfilled in the times
of the Messiah, either at the first or latter part of them; especially
the last is to be understood, when indeed all Israel shall return to the
Lord, and be saved; and then it will appear, that the Lord, who was
their God, as was evident from his bringing them out of Egyptian
bondage, and continued to be so from that time to the Babylonish
captivity, and even to the times of the Messiah, will now be their God
most clearly and manifestly, having redeemed them from worse than
Egyptian bondage; from the bondage of sin, Satan, the law, the world,
and death; even the Lord Jesus Christ, the true Messiah, they will now
seek and embrace, who is God over all, and equal to such a work of
redemption and salvation; Immanuel, God with us, God in our nature, our
Lord and our God, the God of the Jews now converted, as will be
acknowledged, as well as of the Gentiles: and he

will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the solemn
feast; alluding to the feast of tabernacles, kept in commemoration of
the Israelites dwelling in tents in the wilderness, [Lev
23:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#042.md); typical of Christ's
incarnation, expressed by his tabernacling among men in human nature,
[Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md); and which feast, though
abolished by Christ with the rest, yet it is said will be kept by
converted Jews and Gentiles in the latter day; which can be understood
no otherwise than of their embracing and professing the incarnate
Saviour, partaking of the blessings of grace that come by him, and
attending on those ordinances of public worship instituted by him; see
[Zac 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016.md); and which booths, tents,
or tabernacles, the Israelites dwelt in at that feast, were also typical
of the churches of Christ under the Gospel dispensation, and which are
here meant; and in which it is here promised the converted Jews shall
dwell, as they had been used to do in their booths at the solemn feast
of tabernacles. These Christian churches resembling them in the matter
of them; believers in Christ, the materials of such churches, being
compared to goodly trees, to willows of the brook, to palm trees, olive
trees, and myrtle trees, with others, the branches of which were used at
the above feast, to make their tabernacles with; see [Lev
23:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#040.md); and in the use of them, which
was to dwell in during the time of the said feast; as the churches of
Christ are the tabernacles of the most High, the dwelling places of
Father, Son, and Spirit; and the habitation of the saints, where they
dwell and enjoy great plenty and prosperity, tranquillity and security;
and here it particularly denotes that joy, peace, and the converted Jews
shall partake of in the churches of Christ in the latter day; of which
the feast of tabernacles was but a shadow, and which was attended with
much rejoicing, plenty of provisions, and great safety.

I have also spoken to the prophets,.... Or, "I will speak" (b); for this
respects not the Lord's speaking by the prophets of the Old Testament
who spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost; though all they said
were for the use of, and profitable unto, Christian churches; but his
speaking by the apostles, prophets, and teachers, under the Gospel
dispensation; by whom the doctrines of grace have been more clearly
dispensed, and which are no other than the voice of Christ speaking in
them; and which it is both a privilege to hear, and a duty to attend
unto; see [Eph 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011.md);

and I have multiplied visions: or, "will multiply visions" (c); more
than under the former dispensation, as was foretold by Joel, [Joe
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#028.md); see [Act
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#016.md); witness the visions of the
Apostles Peter, Paul, John, and others: or this may respect the more
clear sight and knowledge of Gospel truths in the times of the Messiah,
then under the Mosaic economy; see [Co2
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#013.md);

and used similitudes by the ministry of the prophets: or, "will use
similitudes" (d); for this is to be understood, not of the types and
figures used by the Lord under the legal dispensation, to represent
spiritual things, as the brasen serpent, passover lamb, manna, and the
sacrifices of the law; nor of the similitudes used by the prophet Hosea,
taking a wife and children of whoredoms, to set forth the case and
condition of Israel, and of the comparisons he makes of God, to a lion,
leopard, bear, &c. or by any other of the former prophets; but of
parables and similitudes used in Gospel times; not only such as Christ
used himself, who seldom spoke without a parable; see [Mat
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#011.md); but which he used by the
ministry of his apostles and prophets, and which are to be met with in
their discourses and writings; see [Co1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#006.md); and especially such seem to be
meant that respect the conversion of the Jews, and the glory of the
church in the latter day, [Rom 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#016.md).

Is there iniquity in Gilead?.... Idolatry there? strange that there
should be, seeing it was a city of the priests; a city of refuge; or
there is none there, say the priests, who pretended they did not worship
idols, but the true Jehovah in them: or, "is there not iniquity", or
idolatry, "in Gilead" (e)? verily there is, let them pretend to what
they will: or, "is there only iniquity in it" (f)? that the men of it
should be carried captive, as they were by TiglathPileser, before the
rest of the tribes; see [Kg2 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029.md);
no, there is iniquity and idolatry committed in other places, as well as
there, who must expect to share the same fate in time: or, "is Gilead
Aven?" (g) that is, Bethaven, the same with Bethel; it is as that, as
guilty of idolatry as Bethel, where one of the calves was set up:

surely they are vanity: the inhabitants of Gilead, as well as of Bethel,
worshipping idols, which are most vain things, vanity itself, and
deceive those that serve them, and trust in them:

they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal: to idols, as the Targum adds; and so
Jarchi and Kimchi; according to Aben Ezra, they sacrificed them to Baal;
this shows that Gilead was not the only place for idolatry, which was on
the other side Jordan, but Gilgal, which was on this side Jordan, was
also polluted with it. The Vulgate Latin version is,

"in Gilgal they were sacrificing to bullocks;''

to the calves there, the same as were at Dan and Bethel; so, in the
Septuagint version of [Kg1 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#029.md); it
was formerly read: and so Cyril (h) quotes it, "he (Jeroboam) set the
one (calf) in Gilgal, and the other in Dan"; hence the fable that
Epiphanius (i) makes mention of, that, when Elisha was born, the golden
ox or heifer at Gilgal bellowed very loudly, and so loud as to be heard
at Jerusalem. The Targum makes mention of an idol temple here; and as it
was near to Bethel, as appears from [Sa1
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#003); and from Josephus (k.md); and so
Jerom says (l), hard by Bethel; some suspect another Gilgal; hence it
might be put for it; however, it was a place of like idolatrous worship;
it is mentioned as such along with Bethaven or Bethel, in [Hos
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015.md); see also [Hos
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#015.md);

yea, their altars are as heaps in, the furrows of the fields; not only
in the city of Gilgal, and in the temple there, as the Targum; but even
without the city, in the fields they set up altars, which looked like
heaps of stones; or they had a multitude of altars that stood as thick
as they. So the Targum,

"they have multiplied their altars, like heaps upon the borders of the
fields;''

and the Jewish commentators in general understand this as expressive of
the number of their altars, and of the increase of idolatrous worship;
but some interpret it of the destruction of their altars, which should
become heaps of stones and rubbish, like such as are in fields. These
words respect Ephraim or the ten tribes, in which these places were,
whose idolatry is again taken notice of, after gracious promises were
made to Judah. Some begin here a new sermon or discourse delivered to
Israel.

And Jacob fled into the country of Syria,.... Or, "field of Syria" (m);
the same with Padanaram; for "Padan", in the Arabic language, as Bochart
has shown, signifies a field; and "Aram" is Syria, and is the word here
used. This is to be understood of Jacob's fleeing thither for fear of
his brother Esau, the history of which is had in [Gen
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#001.md); though some interpret this of
his fleeing from Laban out of the field of Syria into Gilead, [Gen
31:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#021.md); and so make it to be introduced
as an aggravation of the sin of the inhabitants of Gilead, that that
place, which had been a refuge and sanctuary to their ancestor in his
distress, should be defiled with idolatry; but the words will not bear
such a construction, and the following seem to militate against it:

and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep; and so the
last clause is supplied by the Targum, Jarchi, and Kimchi: this was
after his flight into Syria, and before he fled from Laban, whom he
served seven years for Rachel; and then served him by keeping his sheep
seven years more for the same: though it may be understood of his two
wives, thus; he served seven years for a wife, for Rachel intentionally,
but eventually it was for Leah; and then he kept sheep seven years more
for his other wife Rachel; the history of this is in [Gen
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#001.md). This is mentioned to show the
meanness of Jacob the ancestor of the Israelites, from whom they had
their original and name; he was a fugitive in the land of Syria; there
he was a Syrian ready to perish, a very poor man, obliged to serve and
keep sheep for a wife, having no dowry to give; and this is observed
here to bring, down the pride of Israel, who boasted of their descent,
which is weak and foolish for any to do; and to show the goodness of God
to Jacob, and to them, in raising him and them from so low an estate and
condition to such eminency and greatness as they were; and to upbraid
their ingratitude to the God of their fathers, and of their mercies,
whom they had revolted from, and turned to idols.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hos 12:13</span></span>

And by a prophet the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt,.... Or, "by the
prophet"; the famous and most excellent prophet Moses, who, by way of
eminency, is so called; him the Lord sent, and employed, and made use of
him as an instrument to bring his people out of their bondage in Egypt;
in which he was a type of Christ the great Prophet of the church, raised
up like unto him, and the Redeemer of his people from sin, Satan, and
the world, law, hell, and death, and all enemies:

and by a prophet he was preserved; by the same prophet Moses was Israel
preserved at the Red sea, and in the wilderness; where they were kept as
a flock of sheep from their powerful enemies, and brought to the borders
of Canaan's land. Some understand this last clause of Joshua, by whom
the Israelites were safely conducted through Jordan into the land of
Canaan, and settled there; and particularly were brought by him to
Gilgal, where the covenant of circumcision was renewed, and the first
passover in the land kept, but now a place of idolatry, as before
mentioned; and which sin was aggravated by this circumstance: but the
design of this observation seems to be to put the Israelites in
remembrance of their low estate in Egypt, and of the goodness of God to
them in delivering them from thence, which they had sadly requited by
their degeneracy and apostasy from him; and to him unto them how much
they ought to have valued the prophets of the Lord, though they had
despised them, since they had received such benefits and blessings by
the means of a prophet.

Ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly,.... The Vulgate Latin
version supplies it, me; that is, God, as Kimchi; or his Lord, as it may
be supplied from the last clause of the verse; the sense is the same
either way: it was God that Ephraim or the ten tribes provoked to stir
up his wrath and vengeance against them; notwithstanding all the favours
that they and their ancestors had received from him, they provoked him
in a most bitter manner, to bitter anger, vehement wrath and fury: or,
"with bitternesses" (n); with their sins, which are in their own nature
bitter, displeasing to God; and in their effects bring bitterness and
death on those that commit them; meaning particularly their idolatry,
and all belonging to it; their idols, high places, altars, &c. The word
here used is rendered "high heaps" (o), [Jer
31:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#021.md); and is here by Kimchi
interpreted of altars, with which, and their sacrifices on them, they
provoked the Lord to anger:

therefore shall he leave his blood upon him; the blood of innocent
persons, prophets, and other good men shed by him; the sin of it shall
be charged upon him, and he shall bear the punishment of it. So the
Targum,

"the fault of innocent blood which he shed shall return upon him:''

or "his own blood shall be poured out upon him" (p); in just retaliation
for the blood of others shed by him, and for all the blood sired by him
in idolatrous sacrifices, and other bloody sins; or his own blood being
shed by the enemy shall remain upon him unrevenged; God will not punish
those that shed it:

and his reproach shall his Lord return unto him: that is, as he has
reproached the prophets of the Lord for reproving him for his idolatry,
and reproached fire Lord himself, by revolting from him, and neglecting
his worship, and preferring the worship of idols to him; so, as a just
recompence, he shall be delivered up into the hands of the enemy, and
become a reproach, a taunt, and a proverb, in all places into which he
shall be brought. God is called "his Lord", though he had rebelled
against him, and shook off his yoke, and would not obey him; yet,
whether he will or not, he is his Lord, and will show himself to be so
by his sovereignty and authority over him, and by the judgments
exercised on him. Some understand this of the Assyrian king, become his
lord, by taking and carrying him captive, the instrument in God's hand
of bringing him to reproach; but the former sense seems best.
