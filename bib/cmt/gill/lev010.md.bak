INTRODUCTION TO LEVITICUS 10

This chapter begins with the sin and punishment of two sons of Aaron,
Nadab and Abihu, [Lev 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001.md) for whose
death Aaron and his sons are commanded not to mourn, nor to depart from
the tabernacle, [Lev 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#006.md) and an order
is given, prohibiting the priests from drinking wine when they went into
it, [Lev 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#008.md) the law of eating holy
things, both those that were more, and those that were less holy, is
enjoined, [Lev 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#012.md) and the flesh of
the sin offering not being eaten, but burnt, Aaron's sons are blamed for
it, for which he makes an apology to the satisfaction of Moses, [Lev
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#016.md).

[Leviticus 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 10:1</span></span>

And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron,.... His two eldest sons, as
seems from [Exo 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#023.md),

took either of them his censer; a vessel in which coals of fire were
put, and incense upon them, and burnt it, and so it follows:

and put fire therein, and put incense thereon; which, as Aben Ezra says,
was on the eighth day, that is, of their consecration, the day after
their consecration was completely finished, and the same day that Aaron
had offered the offerings for himself and for the people, see [Lev
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#001.md),

and offered strange fire before the Lord; upon the golden altar of
incense, which stood in the holy place right against the vail, within
which were the ark, mercy seat, and cherubim, the symbol and seat of the
divine Majesty: this fire was not that which came down from heaven, and
consumed the sacrifice, as related at the end of the preceding chapter
[Lev 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#024.md), but common fire, and
therefore called strange; it was not taken off of the altar of burnt
offering, as it ought to have been, but, as the Targum of Jonathan, from
under the trivets, skillets, or pots, such as the flesh of peace
offerings were boiled in, in the tabernacle:

which he commanded not; yea, forbid, by sending fire from heaven, and
ordering coals of fire for the incense to be taken off of the altar of
burnt offering; and this, as Aben Ezra observes, they did of their own
mind, and not by order. It does not appear that they had any command to
offer incense at all at present, this belonged to Aaron, and not to them
as yet; but without any instruction and direction they rushed into the
holy place with their censers, and offered incense, even both of them,
when only one priest was to offer at a time, when it was to be offered,
and this they also did with strange fire. This may be an emblem of
dissembled love, when a man performs religious duties, prays to God, or
praises him without any cordial affection to him, or obeys commands not
from love, but selfish views; or of an ignorant, false, and misguided
zeal, a zeal not according to knowledge, superstitious and hypocritical;
or of false and strange doctrines, such as are not of God, nor agree
with the voice of Christ, and are foreign to the Scriptures; or of human
ordinances, and the inventions of men, and of everything that man brings
of his own, in order to obtain eternal life and salvation.

[Leviticus 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 10:2</span></span>

And there went out fire from the Lord,.... They sinned by fire, and they
were punished by fire, either from heaven, or from the most holy place,
where the Lord dwelt between the cherubim; this was of the nature of
lightning, as appears by what follows:

and devoured them; not reduced them to ashes, for neither their bodies
nor their clothes were burnt with this fire, as is clear from [Lev
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#004.md) but their lives were destroyed,
they were lifeless, their souls were separated from their bodies by it,
and they died; which is often the case by the lightning, that the
clothes of those who are killed with it are untouched, and scarce any
marks of violence on their bodies; and so the Targum of Jonathan says of
these, their bodies were not burnt:

and they died before the Lord; upon the spot where they were offering
incense, in the holy place, over against the most holy place. This was
very awful, like the case of Ananias and Sapphira, and may seem severe:
it was for the terror of others in the priesthood, or who should come
after, to take care that they performed their office according to the
divine precepts, and brought in no innovation into their service. And
when it is considered that these were the sons of the high priest, newly
invested with an high and honourable office, and just had the laws of
the priesthood delivered unto them, and yet deviated from them as soon
as in their office, and very probably, from what follows, went drunk
into their service, their sin will appear aggravated, and the punishment
less severe. This shows there is nothing in carnal descent, these were
the sons of Aaron the high priest, that acted this part, and came to
this end; the proneness of men to transgress the laws of God as soon as
given them; thus the people of Israel fell into idolatry as soon as the
moral law was given; and here the priests, as soon as the ceremonial
laws, relating to the priesthood, were delivered to them; and also that
the law made sinful men priests, and that the Levitical priesthood was
imperfect; and that no order of men are free from sin, or exempt from
punishment: and the whole of the divine conduct in this affair may lead
us to observe how jealous God is in matters of worship; how much he
dislikes hypocrites, and formal professors; how severe he will be
against such who bring in strange doctrines; what will be the fate of
the contemners of Gospel doctrines and ordinances; and how much he
resents those who trust in themselves, and their works, and bring in
anything of their own in the business of salvation, which is strange
fire, sparks of their own kindling, a burning incense to their own drag,
and sacrificing to their own net.

[Leviticus 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 10:3</span></span>

And Moses said unto Aaron,.... Upon this awful occasion, and in order to
quiet and humble him under the mighty hand of God:

this is it that the Lord spoke, saying; but when he spoke it, and where
it is said and recorded, is not so very clear; it might have been said,
and yet not recorded, or the substance of it may be recorded, though not
in the express words here delivered; it may refer, as some think, to
[Exo 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#022.md) or else to [Exo
29:43](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#043.md) which seems to come nearest to
what follows, so Jarchi:

I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me; in the priests that drew
nigh to him, and offered sacrifice and burnt incense to him; by these he
expected to be sanctified, not to be made holy, but to be declared to be
so, and obeyed and worshipped as such; as he is, when his commands and
ordinances are observed, as he would have them be, in faith and fear,
which were not done by these sons of Aaron; and therefore the Lord, by
the punishment he inflicted, showed himself to be an holy, righteous,
and jealous God:

and before all the people I will be glorified; as he is when he is
believed and trusted in; when his worship is carried on in his own
house, according to his will; when his ordinances are kept as they were
delivered, and when he is reverenced in the assembly of his saints; all
which were wanting in this case. And this may also have respect to the
glory of divine justice, in the public punishment of the sin of those
men, that since he was not glorified by them before the people in the
way of their duty, he would glorify himself in their punishment:

and Aaron held his peace: was in a stupor, as the Septuagint, quite
amazed, thunderstruck, as we say; he was silent, said not one word
against what was done; murmured not at the providence, nor complained of
any severity, but was patient under the hand of God, and resigned to his
will; and since God was sanctified and glorified, he was contented.

[Leviticus 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 10:4</span></span>

And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel, the uncle of
Aaron,.... Uzziel was a son of Kohath, a brother of Amram, the father of
Aaron, and so Aaron's uncle, as here; he had four sons, two of which are
here mentioned as called by Moses; these were first cousins to Aaron,
and second to his sons; see [Exo 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#018.md),

and said unto them, come near; it is very probable they were in the
court of the tabernacle, being Kohathites, of the tribe of Levi; but not
being priests, had no right to go into the holy place, where the two
sons of Aaron lay dead, without a special order for it, which they here
had for this time, and upon this occasion:

carry your brethren from before the sanctuary, out of the camp; the sons
of Aaron are called their brethren, though but cousins, it being usual
to call any relations brethren, and even if only of the same tribe, yea,
of the same nation. Now these were ordered to take the dead bodies of
Aaron's sons out of the holy place, and out of the tabernacle, even from
before it, which, as Aben Ezra says, was the court over against the
camp; and they were to carry them out of the camp into some field, or
place adjacent, and there bury them; it not being usual in those times
to bury in cities and towns, and much less in places devoted to sacred
worship, as the tabernacle was; and therefore they were carried from
both the sanctuary and the camp: it is an observation of Aben Ezra,
that"some say the incense was before the altar of burnt offering, and
the Levites entered there;''but if by incense is meant the altar of
incense, the place where these sons of Aaron offered theirs, that was in
the holy place, and not in the court, where stood the altar of burnt
offering: but they seem to mean as if their incense was offered in
another place, and not on the altar, somewhere in the court, and before
you come to the altar of burnt offering; and so the persons Moses called
could come in thither, and take up their bodies there fallen: but the
same writer observes, that others say, that"it was upon the altar of
incense (i.e. that their incense was offered), and Moses brought them
out of the tabernacle of the congregation,''and then called these men to
carry them from thence without the camp.

[Leviticus 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 10:5</span></span>

So they went near,.... To the place where the bodies lay, having an
order from Moses so to do, let them have been where they will:

and carried them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses had said; or
bid them do; they took them up in their clothes as they found them, and
carried them in them; not that these men carried them in their own
coats, but in the coats of the dead, as Jarchi expresses it; and had
them without the camp, and there buried them, probably in their coats in
which they had sinned, and in which they died: the Targum of Jonathan
says, they carried them on iron hooks in their coats, and buried them
without the camp.

[Leviticus 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 10:6</span></span>

And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar, and unto Ithamar, his
sons,.... His two younger sons, which yet remained; and so the
Septuagint version adds, as in [Lev
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#012.md).

uncover not your heads; that is, do not take off your mitre, as the
Septuagint version; or the bonnets which they wore in the time of their
ministry; for the Jewish priests always had their mitres and bonnets on
when they sacrificed; in imitation of which, the Heathens had their
heads covered when they offered their sacrifices (k): now it was the
way, or custom of a mourner, as Ben Melech observes, to remove his
mitre, bonnet, or tiara, from his head; but in this case, that no sign
of mourning might be shown, Aaron and his sons are forbid to uncover the
head: the Targum of Onkelos is,"do not increase the hair,''or nourish
it, or suffer it to grow, as Jarchi and Ben Gersom interpret it: now in
times of distress and mourning they used to let the hair grow, whether
on the head or beard, see [Sa2 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#024.md)
and in this the Jews were imitated by the Egyptians, contrary to other
nations; the priests of the gods in other places, says Herodotus (l),
took care of their hair (or wore their hair), in Egypt they are shaved;
with others the custom is, for the head immediately to be shaved at
funerals; but the Egyptians, at death, suffer their hair to grow in the
parts before shaved; but this custom with the Jews, though at other
times used, is here forbid Aaron and his sons:

neither rend your clothes, which was sometimes done at the report of the
death of near relations, as children, in token of mourning, [Gen
37:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#034.md) but here it is forbid, that
there might be no sign of it: it is a particular word that is here used:
Ben Melech says, there is a difference between rending and tearing;
tearing is in the body of a garment where there is no seam, but rending
(which is what is here meant) where there is a seam: the priests rending
their garments was after this manner, according to the Jewish canons
(m),"an high priest rends below and a common priest above;''that is, as
one of their commentators (n) interprets it, the former rends the
extreme part of his garment next the feet, and the latter at the breast
near the shoulder; but in this case no rent at all was to be made:

lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people; so very provoking
to God would be any signs of mourning in Aaron and his sons, on this
account:

but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning
which the Lord hath kindled: though Aaron and his sons might not mourn
on this occasion, the whole body of the people might, though not bewail
so much the death of the persons, as the cause of it; and be concerned
for the awful judgment of God, and for the wrath that was sone forth,
lest it should proceed and destroy others also, all being sinners.

[Leviticus 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lev 10:7</span></span>

And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation, lest ye die,.... That is, they were not to relinquish the
service of the sanctuary, on the account of the death of these relations
of theirs, and through grief for it, but go on in it; not Aaron on
account of his children, nor his sons on account of their brethren: from
hence, says Ben Gersom, we learn, that whatsoever priest leaves his
service, and goes out of the sanctuary, is guilty of death: some think
the seven days of consecration were not quite over, during which time
Aaron and his sons were obliged to continue there, on pain of death,
[Lev 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#033.md) but it is pretty plain those
days were over, and that it was the day after the consecration was
finished; see [Lev 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#001.md) and See Gill on
[Lev 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#002.md) wherefore this respects
their continuance in the tabernacle on the day the above affair
happened, and they were obliged to continue in and go through the
service of the day, notwithstanding that:

for the anointing oil of the Lord is upon you; a learned man (o) infers
from hence, that this affair happened within the days of consecration,
they being every day afresh anointed with oil, at least had it, with the
blood of the sacrifices, sprinkled on them, on their garments, taking it
in the strict sense, for the oil being still upon them; whereas it seems
only to signify, that inasmuch as they were consecrated with oil to the
priest's office, they were under obligation to continue and perform
their service without being let or hindered by what had happened:

and they did according to the word of Moses; they showed no tokens of
mourning on account of the dead, and did not offer to go out of the
tabernacle and leave their service.

[Leviticus 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lev 10:8</span></span>

And the Lord spake unto Aaron,.... Because he was a prophet, Aben Ezra
says; but the reason rather seems to be, because be was the high priest,
and now invested with his office, and in the execution of it, and
therefore the following law respecting the priest's drinking of wine was
given: some say, as the same writer observes, that God spake to him by
Moses; but it rather seems that he spoke to Aaron immediately: according
to Jarchi, this order was delivered to him as a reward for his silence,
and to do honour to him on that account: saying; as follows.

[Leviticus 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 10:9</span></span>

Do not drink wine or strong drink,.... This law following upon the
affair of Nadab and Abihu has caused some to think, and not without some
reason, that they were drunk with wine or strong drink, when they
offered strange fire; and indeed it is hardly to be accounted for upon
any other foot that they should do it; but having feasted that day upon
the peace offerings, and drank freely, it being the first day of their
entrance on their office, they were, it may be supposed, elated and
merry, and drank more than they should; wherefore this law was given, to
restrain from such a disorderly and scandalous practice; not only wine,
which is inebriating, but strong drink also is forbidden, which, as Aben
Ezra says, is made either of a sort of wheat, or honey, or dates: and so
Kimchi (p) and Ben Melech on the place after him observe, that this
includes whatsoever inebriates, besides wine; and that their doctors
say, whosoever drinks milk or honey (they must mean some strong liquor
extracted from thence), if he enters into the tabernacle he is guilty:

thou nor thy sons with thee; the Targum of Jonathan adds, as did thy
sons, who died by the burning of fire; that is, he and his sons were to
avoid drinking wine or strong drink to excess, as his two sons had done,
which led them to offer strange fire, for which they suffered death:

when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die; they
might drink wine at other times, in a moderate manner; but it seems by
this they were not to drink any at all when they were about to go to
service, or to enter into the tabernacle in order to do it: indeed,
according to the Jewish canons, every priest that is fit for service, if
he drinks wine, it is forbidden him to enter in (to the tabernacle, and
so) from the altar (of burnt offering) and inward (into the holy place);
and if he goes in and does his service it is profane (unlawful and
rejected), and he is guilty of death by the hand of heaven; and he that
drinks the fourth part (of a log) of wine at one time, of wine forty
days old; but if he drinks less than a fourth part of wine, or drinks a
fourth part and stops between, and mixes it with water, or drinks wine
out of the press within forty days (i.e. not quite so many days old),
though more than a fourth part, he is free, and does not profane his
service; if he drinks more than a fourth part of wine, though it is
mixed, and though he stops and drinks little by little, he is guilty of
death, and his service is profane (or rejected); if he is drunk with the
rest of liquors that make drunk, he is forbidden to go into the
sanctuary; but if he goes in and serves, and he is drunk with the rest
of liquors that make drunk, whether of milk or of figs (a strong liquor
made of them), he is to be beaten, but his service is right; for they
are not guilty of death but on account of wine in the hour of service;
and it does not profane service, but being drunken with wine (q): in
imitation of this, Heathen priests were forbid wine, and abstained from
it, particularly the Egyptian priests; at whom it is said (r), some of
them never drink any wine, and others taste but a little of it, because
it is said to harm the nerves, to fill the head, or make it heavy, to
hinder invention and excite to lust:

it shall be a statute for ever throughout all your generations: even to
the coming of the Messiah; and now under the Gospel dispensation, though
wine in moderation is allowed Gospel ministers, yet they are not to be
given to it; it is a shame to any Christian man to be drunk with wine,
and more especially a minister, and still more so when in his service;
see [Eze 44:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#021.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 10:10</span></span>

And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy,.... That being
sober they might be able to distinguish between the one and the other;
which a drunken man, having his mind and senses disturbed, is not
capable of; as between holy and unholy persons, and between holy and
unholy things; particularly, as Aben Ezra interprets it, between a
sacred place and one that is common, and between a holy day and a common
week day; the knowledge and memory of which may be lost through
intemperance; and so that may be done in a place and on a day which
ought not to be done, or that omitted on a day and in a place which
ought to be done:

and between unclean and clean; between unclean men and women, beasts and
fowls, and clean ones; and between unclean things in a ceremonial sense,
and those that are clean, which a man in liquor may be no judge of:
hence, as the above writer observes, after this section follow laws
concerning fowls clean and unclean, the purification of a woman after
childbirth, the leprosy in men, garments and houses, and concerning
profluvious and menstruous persons; all which the priests were to be
judges of, and therefore ought to be sober.

[Leviticus 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lev 10:11</span></span>

And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes,.... Laws,
precepts, ordinances, moral, ceremonial, and judicial, which was the
business of the priests to do, [Mal
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007.md) but one inebriated with liquor
would be incapable of giving instructions about any of those things:

which the Lord hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses: particularly
those delivered and recorded in [Exo
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#001.md) and as not the priests, so
neither any other Israelite might instruct (s), nor indeed would be
capable of instructing others when in liquor; and therefore excessive
drinking, as it should be carefully avoided by all men, so more
especially by those who by their office are teachers of others; see [Pro
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#004.md).

[Leviticus 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lev 10:12</span></span>

And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar, and unto Ithamar, his sons
that were left,.... Of the burning, as the Targum of Jonathan; who
survived his other two sons that were burnt, who remained alive, not
being concerned with them in their sin, and so shared not in their
punishment:

take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the Lord made
by fire; for all but the handful that was burnt of that kind of
offerings belonged to the priests, see [Lev
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#014.md) this meat offering, according to
Jarchi, was the meat offering of the eighth day, that is, of the
consecration, or the day after it was finished, on which the above awful
case happened, [Lev 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#017.md) and also the
meat offering of Nahshon the son of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah,
who offered his offering first at the dedication of the altar, on the
day the tabernacle was set up, which he supposes was on this day, see
[Num 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#001.md), now these meat offerings
were not as yet eaten, and which may be true of the first of them,
wherefore Aaron and his sons, notwithstanding their mourning, are bid to
take it:

and eat it without leaven beside the altar: the altar of burnt offering
in the court of the tabernacle, as directed See Gill on [Lev
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#016.md),

for it is most holy: and so might be eaten by none but holy persons,
such as were devoted to sacred services, and only in the holy place, as
follows; within hangings, where the most holy things were eaten, as
Jarchi, that is, within the court of the tabernacle, which was made of
hangings.

[Leviticus 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lev 10:13</span></span>

And ye shall eat it in the holy place,.... Not in that which was
properly so called, but in the court of the tabernacle; at the door of
the tabernacle of the congregation, as Aben Ezra, in some apartment
there; for it was not to be carried out of the sanctuary, and eaten in
their own houses or tents, as others might, after mentioned:

because it is thy due, and thy sons' due, of the offerings of the Lord
made by fire; and not any others; neither his wife nor his daughters,
nor any other related to him, or whom he might invite, as in other
cases, might eat of it; this none but he and his sons might eat of, and
nowhere else but in the sanctuary:

for so I am commanded; to make known and declare this as the will of
God.

[Leviticus 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 10:14</span></span>

And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean
place,.... The breast of the peace offerings that was waved, and the
shoulder of them that was heaved before the Lord; these were given by
him to the priests, towards the maintenance of their families, [Lev
7:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#034.md) and they might be eaten anywhere,
provided the place was clean from all ceremonial pollution, and in which
there were no polluted persons, as leprous ones; they were to be eaten
within the camp, as Jarchi observes, where lepers came not: for, as he
adds, the light holy things, such as these were, might be eaten in every
city; and so it it is said in the Misnah (t), and by the commentators on
it:

thou and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee; these were not
restrained to him and his sons only, as the meat offerings, and the
flesh of the sin offerings were, but were common to the whole family:

for they be thy due, and thy sons' due; for their service of the
sanctuary, and by the appointment and direction of the Lord:

which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children
of Israel: of which see [Lev 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#001.md) these
are said to be "given out" of them, for the whole was not given, only
the breast and shoulder; and after the fat was burnt, the rest belonged
to the owners, with which they kept a feast of joy and thankfulness.

The heave shoulder and wave breast shall they bring,.... Not the
priests, but the owners to the priests, [Lev
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#029.md),

with the offerings made by fire of the fat: upon the inwards, kidneys,
and caul of the liver, which was all burnt:

to wave it for a wave offering before the Lord, the shoulder was lifted
up, and the breast waved to and fro before the Lord of the whole earth,
and towards the several parts of it, to show and own his right to all
they had, and then they were given to the priests as a token of it:

and it shall be thine, and thy sons with thee; both the shoulder and the
breast:

by a statute for ever, to be observed as long as the ceremonial law and
Levitical priesthood lasted, even to the end of the Jewish age and
economy, and the coming of the Messiah:

as the Lord hath commanded; [Lev 7:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#033.md).

And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering,.... The Targum
of Jonathan says,"three goats were offered on that day, the goat of the
new moon, of the sin offering for the people, and of the sin offering,
which Nahshon the son of Amminadab offered at the dedication of the
altar; Aaron and his sons, it adds, went and burnt these three, Moses
came and sought, &c.''Jarchi also speaks of three goats offered, but
says that only one was burnt, the goat of the new moon; and so Ben
Gersom, who gives this reason for the diligent search after it, because
it was always to be offered up, and was not a temporary affair, as the
others were: but it rather seems to be the goat of the sin offering for
the people, for it is not certain that the other goats were offered on
this day, but this was, see [Lev 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#015.md)
now according to the law, the flesh of this goat was not to be burnt,
but to be eaten by the priests in the holy place, see [Lev
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#025.md). Moses now suspecting that Aaron
and his sons, through their grief for the death of Nadab and Abihu, had
neglected the eating of it, sought diligently after it, and so it
proved:

and, behold, it was burnt: as they had no appetite to it themselves,
they burnt it, that it might not be eaten by any others, for none but
they might eat it, and that it might not corrupt:

and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron, which were
left alive; when their two elder brothers were killed with lightning for
doing what was not commanded, which should have made them more observant
of the laws of God, to do that which was commanded them: and though they
were spared, and survived their brethren, yet they transgressed, in
burning the sin offering of the people, when they should have eaten it.
Jarchi observes, that he expressed his anger not to Aaron, but to his
sons, which he did for the honour of Aaron, laying the blame not on him,
who was overwhelmed with grief, but on his sons:

saying; as follows.

[Leviticus 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lev 10:17</span></span>

Wherefore have ye not eaten of the sin offering in the holy place,
seeing it is most holy,.... The sin offering was one of the most holy
things, and therefore to be eaten only in the sanctuary; though this was
not the fault they are here charged with that they had eat it, but not
in the holy place; for they had not eaten it at all, but burnt it, as
appears from the preceding verse; this is what they are blamed for
particularly, though they are reminded of the whole law concerning it,
that it was to he eaten by them, that it was to be eaten in the holy
place, the reason of which is given; but they had not eaten it any
where:

and God hath given it to you, to bear the iniquity of the congregation,
to make atonement for them before the Lord? for by eating the sin
offering, or sin itself, as it is in the original text, see [Hos
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#008.md) they made the sins of the people,
for whom the offering was, in some sense their own; and they bore them,
and made a typical atonement for them; in which they were types of
Christ, who was made sin for his people, took their sins upon him, and
by imputation they were made his own, and he bore them in his own body
on the tree, and made full satisfaction and atonement for them. Now
since the eating of the sin offering of the people was of so great
importance and consequence, the neglect of it by the priests was very
blameworthy.

[Leviticus 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lev 10:18</span></span>

Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place,....
When that was the case, indeed, the flesh of the sin offering was not to
be eaten, but burnt, see [Lev 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#030.md) but
this was not the case now, and therefore its flesh should have been
eaten, and not burnt:

ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded, [Lev
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#026.md).

[Leviticus 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lev 10:19</span></span>

And Aaron said unto Moses,.... For what Moses had said was said in his
presence, though not addressed to him directly, but to his sons; and he
was sensible that he was pointed at, and that if there was any blame in
this affair, it lay as much or more on him than on his sons; and
therefore he takes it upon him to give an answer, and to excuse the fact
as well as he could:

behold, this day they have offered their sin offering and their burnt
offering before the Lord; that is, the people of Israel had brought a
kid of the goats for a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb for burnt
offering, and he and his sons assisting him, had offered them for them,
even on the very day his two eldest sons were removed by death in an
awful manner:

and such things have befallen me; at this very time, soon after the
above sacrifices were offered, happened the death of his two sons, which
occasioned great anguish and distress, grief and sorrow, so that he
could not eat of the sin offering; he had no appetite for it, and if he
had, he thought in his present circumstances it would not have been
right, as follows:

and if I had eaten the sin offering today, should it have been accepted
in the sight of the Lord? he being a mourner. The Jews say (u), an high
priest may offer, being a mourner, but not eat; a common priest may
neither offer nor eat; and which they illustrate by this passage, that
Aaron offered and did not eat, but his sons did neither.

\(u\) Misn. Horayot, c. 3. sect. 5. Maimon. & Bartenora in ib.

[Leviticus 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lev 10:20</span></span>

And when Moses heard that, he was content. He said no more, he did not
proceed in blaming him and his sons, but was satisfied with the answer
returned; he considered the grief and trouble of mind that attended
Aaron, which might not only cause him to disregard food, but even to
forget what was commanded to be done in this case; and besides he might
observe, that there was some difficulty attending it; in some cases the
flesh of the sin offering was to be eaten, and not burnt; in others, to
be burnt, and not eaten; and this being the first time of offering one,
the mistake might be the more easily made; and fearing one might be
made, and especially when Aaron was in such circumstances, might be the
reason Moses so diligently sought after the goat of the sin offering:
moreover, what Aaron had done appeared to be not out of any wilful
neglect of the command of God, but with a good design, as judging it
would be unacceptable to him, should he have eaten of it in his
circumstances. Moses upon the whole thought him excusable, at least
insisted no more upon the blame. The Jewish writers make the mistake to
lie on the side of Moses and not Aaron; and which the former
acknowledged, according to the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem: see
[Deu 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#012.md).
