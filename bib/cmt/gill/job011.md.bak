INTRODUCTION TO JOB 11

In this chapter Zophar the Naamathite, Job's third friend, attacks him,
and the with great acrimony and severity, and with much indecency; he
charges him not only with loquacity, and vain babbling, but with lying,
and with scoffing at God, and good men, [Job
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#001.md); which he attempts to support by
some things Job had said, misrepresented by him, [Job
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#004.md); and wishes that God would take
him in hand, and convince him of the wisdom of the divine proceedings
with him, and of his lenity and mercy to him, [Job
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#005.md); and then discourses of the
unsearchableness of God in his counsels, and conduct; of his
sovereignty, and of his power, and of the vanity and folly of men, [Job
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#007.md); and as his friends before him,
having insinuated that Job was guilty of some heinous sin, or sins, and
especially of hypocrisy, advises him to repentance and reformation, and
then it would be well with him; and he should enjoy much comfort, peace,
and safety, even to old age, [Job
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#013.md); and concludes it should go ill
with the wicked man and the hypocrite, such as he suggests Job was, [Job
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#020.md).

[Job 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 11:1</span></span>

Then answered Zophar the Naamathite,.... The third of Job's friends,
that came to visit him; see Gill on [Job
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#011.md); and who perhaps might be the
youngest, since his turn was to speak last; and he appears to have less
modesty and prudence, and more fire and heat in him; than his other
friends; though he might be the more irritated by observing, that their
arguments were baffled by Job, and had no manner of effect on him, to
cause him to recede from his first sentiments and conduct:

and said; as follows.

[Job 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 11:2</span></span>

Should not the multitude of words be answered?.... Zophar insinuates,
that Job was a mere babbler, a talkative man, that had words, but no
matter; said a great deal, but there was nothing in what he said; that
his words were but wind, yea, in effect that he was a fool, who is
commonly full of words, and is known by the multitude of them; and
whereas he might think to bear down all before him in this way, and to
discourage persons from giving him an answer; this Zophar suggests
should not be the case, nor would he be deterred hereby from giving one,
which he now undertook: some supply it, as Bar Tzemach, "should not a
man of a multitude of words" (s), &c. a verbose man, a dealer in many
words, and nothing else, should not he be "answered?" if he uses nothing
but words, and there is no argument in them, they seem not to deserve an
answer, unless it be to show the emptiness of them, expose a man's
folly, and pull down his pride and vanity:

and should a man full of talk be justified? or "a man of lips" (t), an
eloquent man, or one that affects to be so; a man of a fine speech, who
artfully colours things, and makes a show of wisdom and truth, when
there are neither in what he says; is such a man to be justified? he
would seem to be in his own eyes at least, if not in the eyes of others,
if not answered; he would be thought to have carried his point, to have
had the better of the argument, and to have got the victory by dint of
words and power of oratory; for this is not to be understood of
justification before God; for as no man is heard and accepted by him for
his "much speaking", as was the opinion of the Heathens, so neither are
any justified on account of their many words, any more than their many
works; since, in a multitude of words there are often not only much
folly and weakness, but vanities and sins, [Pro
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#019.md); there is indeed a sense in
which a man is justified by his words, [Mat
12:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#037.md); when he confesses Christ, and
professes to be justified by his righteousness, and believes in that,
and pleads it as his justifying righteousness; he is justified by that
righteousness; which is contained in the confession and profession of
his faith; but this is not here meant.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 11:3</span></span>

Should thy lies make men hold their peace?.... By which he means, either
lies in common, untruths wilfully told, which are sins of a scandalous
nature, which good men will not dare to commit knowingly; and to give a
man, especially such a man, the lie, is very indecent; and to charge a
man falsely with it is very injurious: or else doctrinal ones, errors in
judgment, falsehoods concerning God and things divine; which not only
are not of the truth, for no lie is of the truth, but are against it;
and indeed where the case is notorious in either sense, men should not
be silent, or be as men deaf and dumb, as the word (u) signifies, as if
they did not hear the lies told them, or were unconcerned about them, or
connived at them: David would not suffer a liar to be near him, nor
dwell in his house, [Psa 101:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#007.md); a
common liar ought to be reproved and rejected; and doctrinal liars and
lies should be opposed and resisted; truth should be contended for, and
nothing be done against it, but everything for it: it is criminal to be
silent at either sort of lies; nor should the bold and blustering manner
in which they are told frighten men from a detection of them, which
perhaps is what may be hinted at here (w); some render the words (x),
"should thine iniquity frighten men?" they are not so strong and nervous
as to appear unanswerable, and deter men from undertaking a reply unto
them:

and, when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed? here Job is
represented as a mocker of God, which is inferred from [Job
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#003.md); and at his friends, and the
arguments they used, and the advice they gave, which is concluded from
his words in [Job 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#025.md); and as one
hardened, who was not, and could not be made ashamed of what he had said
against either, by anything that had been offered for his reproof and
conviction: to make a mock of God, or a jest of divine things, or scoff
at good men, is very bad; indeed it is the character of the worst of
men; and such should be made ashamed, if possible, by exposing their sin
and folly; and if not here, they will be covered with shame hereafter,
when they shall appear before God, the Judge of all, who will not be
mocked, and shall see the saints at the right hand of Christ, whom they
have jeered and scoffed at: but this was not Job's true character; he
was no mocker of God nor of good men; in this he was wronged and
injured, and had nothing of this sort to be made ashamed of.

[Job 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 11:4</span></span>

For thou hast said,.... What follows is produced to support the charge,
especially of lying, which seems to be founded on what he had said in
[Job 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#010.md),

my doctrine is pure; free from error, unadulterated, unmixed, not
blended with Heathenish principles and human doctrines; but tending to
purity of heart and life, as every word of God, and doctrine that comes
from him, is pure, yea, very pure, like silver purified seven times; and
such was Job's doctrine which he "received" from God, "took" (y) up and
professed, taught and delivered to others, so far as was agreeable to
the will of God, and the revelation he had then made: and it appears
that Job had very clear and sublime notions of God, of his being and
perfections, of his works of nature, providence, and grace; of Christ
his living Redeemer, of redemption and justification by him, and of the
resurrection of the dead; and had purer and better notions of divine
things than his friends had, and spoke better things of God than they
did, God himself being witness, [Job
42:7](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#007.md); some interpret this of the
purity of his life and conversation: he is further charged with saying:

and I am clean in thine eyes: speaking to God, as Jarchi observes; and
indeed so he was, and every believer is, in an evangelic sense; as to
the new man, which is created in righteousness and true holiness, is
without sin, and cannot commit it; and as washed from all sin in the
blood of Christ, and as clothed with his righteousness, in which the
saints are faultless before the throne, and are unblamable and
irreprovable in the sight of God: but Zophar's meaning is, that Job had
asserted that he was entirely free from sin in himself, was wholly
without it, and did not commit any; and had appealed to God, as knowing
it to be true; and which he seems to have grounded on what he had said,
[Job 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#007.md); through a mistake of his
sense; which was not that he was free from sin entirely, but from any
gross notorious sin, or from a wicked course of living, and particularly
from the sin of hypocrisy, his friends suggested he was guilty of;
otherwise he confesses himself a sinner, and prays for the pardon of his
sins, and disclaims perfection in himself; see [Job
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#020.md); and indeed there is no creature
in itself clean in the sight of God, either angels or men; every man is
naturally unclean; no good man is without sin, without the being,
indwelling, and commission of it; nor will any truly gracious man say he
is; he knows otherwise, and acknowledges it; he that says he is must be
an ignorant man, or a vain and pharisaical man; yea, must not say the
truth: some have suspected the first part of the words to be Job's, "and
I am clean": and the other Zophar's explaining them; that is, "in thine
eyes" (z); in his own apprehension, as if he had a high and conceited
opinion of himself.

[Job 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 11:5</span></span>

But O that God would speak,.... To Job, and stop his mouth, so full of
words; convict him of his lies, reprove him for his mocks and scoffs,
and make him ashamed of them; refute his false doctrine and oppose it,
and show him his folly and vanity in imagining it to be pure, and in
conceit thinking himself to be free from sin, and even in the sight of
God himself: Zophar seems by this wish to suggest, that what his friends
had as yet spoke had had no effect upon Job, and signified nothing; and
that he despaired of bringing him to any true sense of himself and his
case, but that God only could do it; and therefore he entreats he would
take him in hand, and speak unto him; as he had by his providences in
afflicting him, so by his spirit in teaching and instructing him; and he
adds:

and open his lips against thee; or rather, "with thee", or "to thee"
(a); converse with thee; speak out his mind freely; disclose the secrets
of his wisdom, as in [Job 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#006.md), and
that for thy good; fully convince thee of thy sins, mistakes, and
follies: for, notwithstanding all the heat and warmth of Zophar's
spirit, yet, being a good man, as it cannot be thought he should
wilfully and knowingly slander Job, and put a false gloss on his words,
so neither could he desire any hurt or injury to be done him, or that
God would deal with him as an enemy; only convince and reprove him for
his sin, and justify himself and his own conduct, which he imagined Job
had arraigned.

[Job 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 11:6</span></span>

And that he would show thee the secrets of wisdom,.... Either of sound
doctrine, in opposition to his own doctrine he had such a vain opinion
of; and then he would see, as he thought, that it was not so pure as he
imagined it to be: the Gospel, and the doctrines of it, are the wisdom
of God, the produce of it, and in which it is displayed; as in the
doctrines of election to grace and glory, of redemption by Christ, of
justification by his righteousness, and pardon by his blood; by which
all the divine perfections are glorified, the justice and holiness of
God, as well as his grace and mercy: and there are "secrets" or
mysteries in this wisdom of God, [Co1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006.md); of mysterious doctrines, which,
though revealed, yet the "modus", or manner of them, is not to be
searched out and understood; such is the trinity of Persons in the
Godhead, the union of the two natures in Christ, the saint's union to
God and communion with him, the resurrection of the dead, &c. and these
and such like them are only shown by the Lord; men cannot come at them
of themselves, by their own natural reason and understanding; it is God
that reveals them, in his word, and by his spirit, and gives his people
an increasing knowledge of them, [Co1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009.md); or it may be rather the secrets
of the wisdom of Divine Providence, in the government of the world, and
the ordering of all things in it according to the counsel of God, may be
here meant; there is a great display of the wisdom of God in Providence,
and there are secrets in it undiscoverable by creatures; his ways are
past finding out, they are in the deep waters, and his footsteps are not
known, nor to be traced; though sometimes he makes his judgments
manifest, and his mind in them; and what he does now, which men know
not, he shows them hereafter; especially his own people, and
particularly when in the sanctuary of the Lord, and in the way of their
duty, when everything appears right and beautiful they before were ready
to complain of; see [Rom 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033.md); and
then it is seen:

that they are double to that which is! or to "wisdom" (b); as the word
is rendered in [Pro 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#007.md); that is, to
human wisdom; and then the sense is, that the secrets of divine wisdom
displayed, whether in the doctrines of grace or in the methods of
Providence, being shown and made manifest, would appear to be "double";
that is, vastly, yea, infinitely to exceed the wisdom of men; and that
these, which men are apt to arraign as weak and wrong, are the effects
of the highest wisdom, or they then appear so "to a man of wisdom" (c);
so the supply may be made, as is in [Mic
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#009.md); or else the sense is, were Job
let in to the secret wisdom of God more, and into the purity and
holiness of his law, which some understand by "that which is", or
"wisdom", and render it "according to the law" (d) and see what that
requires, and how much short he comes of it, and what and how many were
his transgressions and violations of it; it then would be plain to him,
that the punishment that God, in wisdom, and according to his righteous
law, might inflict upon him, would be double; or, greatly, yea,
infinitely exceed those afflictions he was now exercised with, and
therefore he had no reason to complain; to which agrees what follows:

know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquities
deserve; or punishes, afflicts, or chastises, less than the deserts of
sin; see [Ezr 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#013.md); some render it,
"God exacteth of thee something of thine iniquity"; so Junius and
Tremellius; according to which version the sense is, that sins are
debts, and these many; and that payment of part of the debt of
punishment for them is only required, which is not truth; for, though
there is a debt of punishment due to justice for sin, yet it is not part
of it only that is required of the sinner, but the whole, if any; for
indeed no part of it is exacted of God's people, since the whole has
been exacted of Christ, and he has answered and paid the whole debt, and
blotted out the handwriting against them; wherefore the word used has
rather the signification of forgetfulness, and may be rendered, either
"God hath caused", or "suffered thee to forget part of thine iniquity"
(e); or thou couldest never say that thou wert clean in his eye, and
free from sin; or, "God himself has forgot part of thine iniquity" (f);
in that he has afflicted thee so mildly, and with so much lenity; or,
"hath forgotten thee for thine iniquity" (g); forsook him, hid his face
from him, laid his hand on him, and sorely chastised him, so that he
seemed to be forgotten by him, or he to forget to be gracious to him;
all which were owing to his sins, these were the causes of it; or, "will
condemn thee for thine iniquity" (h).

[Job 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 11:7</span></span>

Canst thou by searching find out God?.... God is not to be found out by
human search; that there is a God may be found out by inquiring into the
book of nature, by considering the creatures that are made, who all
proclaim some first cause or maker of them, who is God; but then it
cannot be found out what God is, his nature, being, and perfections: an
Heathen philosopher (i), being asked by a certain king what God was,
required a day to give in his answer; when that was up he desired a
second, and still went on asking more; and being demanded the reason of
his dilatoriness, replied, the more he had considered the question, the
more obscure it was to him: the world by wisdom, or the wiser part of
the Heathen world, knew not God; though they knew there was one, they
knew not who and what he was; and therefore in some places altars were
erected to the unknown God, [Act
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#023.md), and though some of the
perfections of God may be investigated from the works of nature, such as
the power, wisdom, and goodness of God, [Rom
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#019.md); yet not all his perfections,
such as his grace, mercy, &c. proclaimed and displayed in Christ; nor
indeed his counsels, purposes, and decrees, which lie in his eternal
mind, are the thoughts of his heart, the deep things of God, which none
but the Spirit of God searches, knows, and reveals; and since Zophar's
request was, that God should show to Job "the secrets of wisdom", these
may be meant here, either evangelical wisdom, the wisdom of God in a
mystery hid in his heart from everlasting, and the mysterious truths and
doctrines or it, things which eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor has
it entered into the heart of man to conceive of; these are not to be
found out by human search, but are by the revelation of God; or else the
reasons of the proceedings of God in Providence, which are out of the
reach of men, dark, intricate, mysterious, unsearchable, and past
finding out:

canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? to the uttermost of
his nature and perfections; all his attributes, the last of them, and
the extremity thereof: that God is perfect and entire, wanting nothing,
and is possessed of all perfections, may be found out, or otherwise he
would not be God; but his essence and attributes, being infinite, can
never be traced and comprehended by finite minds; there are some
perfections of God we have no idea of, but are lost in confusion and
amazement as soon as we think of them and reason about them, as his
eternity and immensity particularly; for, when we have rolled over in
our minds millions and millions of ages, we are as far off from eternity
as when we began; and when we have pervaded all worlds, and every space
and place, we have got no further into immensity than at first; we are
confounded when we think of a Being without beginning and without
bounds, unoriginated, and unlimited; yea, even it is but a small part of
the works of God in creation that is known by men, or of God in and by
them; nay, by divine revelation, which gives the clearest and most
enlarged view of him, whereby he has proclaimed his name, a God gracious
and merciful, &c. yet it is only his back parts that are shown, not his
face; it is only through a glass, darkly, we now see; indeed, in the
other world, we shall see him face to face, and as he is, yet then never
comprehend his essence: and, after all, it is only in Christ that God is
to be found, to saving purposes; in him is the most glorious display of
him; being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his
person; and not only all his perfections are in him, as a divine Person,
but they are glorified by him as Mediator; every step in salvation is
taken in Christ, and every blessing of grace comes through him; what of
the divine Presence and communion with God is enjoyed is by him; and he
will be the medium of the enjoyment of God, and of all the glory and
happiness of the saints in the world to come.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 11:8</span></span>

It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do?.... Or, "is higher than the
heavens" (i); either the wisdom of God and the secrets of it; the
perfection of his wisdom, by which he has made the heavens; or
evangelical wisdom, hid in his heart, and which the highest of
creatures, the angels, come at the knowledge of only by revelation; and
therefore, what can man do to find it out, unless God reveals it? or
wisdom displayed in dark providences, which can never be accounted for
until the judgments of God are made manifest: or else, "he that is God",
as the Vulgate Latin version, is "higher than the heavens"; the heaven
is his throne on which he sits, and therefore he must be higher than
that; the heavens, and heaven of heavens, cannot contain him; he fills
up the infinite space beyond them; how is it possible therefore to find
him out, to comprehend him?

deeper than hell; what canst thou know? meaning, neither the grave nor
the place of the damned, for both which "Sheol" is sometimes used, but
the centre or lowest part of the earth; there is a depth in God, in his
essence, in his thoughts, in his wisdom, displayed in nature,
providence, and grace, that is unfathomable; we can know nothing of it
but what he is pleased to make known; see [Psa
92:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#005.md); the Targum of the verse is,"in
the height of heaven, what canst thou do? in the law, which is deeper
than hell, what canst thou know?''

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 11:9</span></span>

The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.
Length is generally ascribed to the earth, and width to the sea; the
ends of the earth are used for a great distance, and the sea is called
the great and wide sea; see (k) [Psa
72:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001.md); but God and his perfections,
particularly his wisdom and understanding, are infinite, [Psa
147:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#005.md); and will admit of no
dimensions; as his love, so his wisdom, has an height which cannot be
reached, a depth that cannot be fathomed, and a length and breadth
immeasurable; see [Eph 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#018.md); from
hence it appears that God is omniscient, omnipresent, and
incomprehensible; and since he is to be found in Christ, and in him
only, it is in vain for us to seek for him elsewhere: next the
sovereignty of God is discoursed of.

If he cut off,.... The horns, power, dominion, and authority of the
wicked; or the spirits of princes, or kingdoms and states, whole
nations, as he did the seven nations of Canaan; or families, as Job's,
his servants, and his children; or particular persons, by diseases, or
by judgments, by famine, sword, and pestilence; there is none can hinder
him; he will do what he pleases: or, as others render it, "if he
changes" (l); if he makes revolutions in governments, changes in
families, and in the estates of men, as in Job's; or changes men's
countenances by death, and sends them out of time into eternity, there
is no opposing him: or, "if he passes through" (m), as the word is
sometimes used; see [Isa 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#008.md); if he
comes out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth, and goes
through a kingdom and nation, making or suffering to be made
devastations everywhere, as he went through the land of Egypt and smote
all the firstborn in it, there is no stopping him: or, "if he passes on"
(n), or "from" hence, or goes away; see [Sa1
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#003.md); or departs from a people or
particular person, even his own people, and hides his face from them,
and is long, at least as they think, before he returns; who can behold
him, or find him out, or cause him to show himself? see [Job
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#003); or, "if he subverts" (o.md) and
overturns things, or should reduce the world and all things in it to a
chaos, as at the deluge, or as he overturned the cities of Sodom and
Gomorrah, or should set on fire the whole course of nature, and burn up
the whole world and all in it, and reduce it to ashes, as he will; there
is none can stay his hand, and obstruct him in his designs and measures:

and shut up; should he do so; shut up in a civil sense, either in a
prison, as Gersom, or in the hands of an enemy, by giving them unto
them, to be enclosed and straitened by them, there is none can deliver;
[Psa 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#008.md); or to shut them up as he
did Noah in the ark, by protecting them by his power and providence, and
so appear to be on their side, and for them; who then can be against
them? or what does it signify if any are, if the Lord shuts them up and
keeps them close? or in a spiritual sense, if he concludes men in sin,
and shuts them up in unbelief, and under the law; who but himself can
set them free? or, if good men are shut up in their frames, and
straitened in their souls, that they cannot come forth in the lively
exercise of grace, and free discharge of duty; there is no opening for
them till he pleases, [Psa 88:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#008.md),

or gather together, then who can hinder him? either gathers them into
one place, in a civil sense; or in a gracious manner, with great mercies
and everlasting kindness to himself, to have communion with him; to his
son, to participate of the blessings of his grace, and to his church and
people, to enjoy all spiritual privileges with them; or, gathers men at
and by death; see [Job 34:14](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#014.md); and as
he will gather them at the last day, even all nations, before him, the
tares, and burn them and his wheat, and put them into his garner; and
when he does any and every of these things, who can hinder him or turn
him back from doing what he pleases: Job says much the same in [Job
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#012.md); the Targum is,

"if he passes through and shuts up the heavens with clouds, and gathers
armies, who can turn him back?"

For he knoweth vain men,.... Or, "men of vanity" (p), as all men are;
men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree a lie, and they are
both lighter than vanity, [Psa 62:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#009.md);
and the Lord knows them, and knows them to be so; he knows all men, and
all that is in them; he knows the vanity of their minds, and the vain
thoughts that are in them; all their vain and idle words, and their vain
lives and conversations; and therefore it is no wonder he does the above
things at his pleasure:

he seeth wickedness also; the wickedness of their hearts and lives,
their secret and open wickedness, their wicked thoughts, words, and
actions; or, "men of wickedness"; even wicked men; they are all seen by
him; nothing is or can be hid from him; he is God omniscient, the
searcher of the hearts and trier of the reins of the children of men:

will he not then consider it? so as to punish or correct for it? he
will: or, "he does not consider" (q); he seems as if he did not; as if
he took no notice of wicked men, and of their wickedness, because he
does not immediately punish or correct for it; or, he has no need to
take any time to consider thereof, he sees and knows at once what it is,
and what men are: Gersom reads this clause in connection with the
former; "he sees the men of wickedness", and him who does "not consider"
the ways of the Lord; or, the man does not consider that God sees him;
so Ben Melech.

For vain man would be wise,.... Or "hollow" (r), empty man; empty of all
that is good, though full of all unrighteousness; without God, the
knowledge, love, and fear of him; without Christ, the knowledge of him,
faith in him, and love to him; destitute of the Spirit, and of his
grace, having no good thing in him: yet such a man "would be wise"; not
desirous of true wisdom, but would be thought to be wise; he in conceit
thinks himself that he is very wise, and he would fain have others think
so of him; or is, or "may", or "will be wise" (s); may be made wise by
the chastisements of God through afflictions, being sanctified to him by
the grace of God; though he is a vain man, and also is what is after
said of him; afflicting dispensations are sometimes teaching ones, and
in the school of afflictions many useful lessons are learnt, whereby men
become wiser; see [Psa 94:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#012.md); though
some understand the word in a very different sense, and interpret it
bold, audacious, proud, and haughty; man takes heart (t), and lifts up
himself against God, stretches his hand, and hardens his heart against
him:

though man be born like a wild ass's colt; foolish and stupid, without
understanding of divine and spiritual things; given to lust and
wantonness, to serve divers lusts and pleasures; not subject to the yoke
of the law of God, stubborn, refractory, and untameable, but by the
grace of God; the ass, and especially the wild ass, and the colt of one,
being a very stupid creature, and a very lustful and wanton one, chooses
to be free, will not bear the yoke, but ranges about in desert places;
see [Job 39:5](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#005.md); some render the words,
"and a wild ass's colt is", or "may be born a man" (u); that is, one
that is by his first birth, and by his life and conversation, like a
wild ass's colt, is or may be born again, and be made a new man, as
Jarchi also interprets it, and so become a wise, knowing, and good man,
which is a great truth; but whether the truth in this text, is not so
clear: the Targum seems to incline this way;"a refractory, youth that
grows wise shall become a great man.''

If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands towards him. In
this and the following verses Zophar proceeds to give some advice to
Job; which, if taken, would issue in his future happiness, but otherwise
it would be ill with him; he advises him to pray to God with an heart
prepared for such service; so some render the last clause in the
imperative, "stretch out thine hands (w) towards him"; that is, towards
God; for, though not expressed, is implied, whose immensity,
sovereignty, and omniscience, Zophar had been discoursing of; and,
though stretching out the hands is sometimes a gesture of persons in
distress and mournful circumstances, thereby signifying their grief and
sorrow, and of others in great danger, in order to lay up anything for
safety; and of conquered persons resigning themselves up into the hands
of the conqueror; and of such who are desirous of being in friendship,
alliance, and association with others; yet it is also sometimes used as
for the whole of religious worship, [Psa
44:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#020.md); so particularly for prayer,
[Psa 88:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#009.md); and this was what all Job's
friends advised him to, to humble himself before God, to pray for the
forgiveness of his sins, and for the removal of his afflictions and
deliverance from them; see [Job 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#008.md);
in order to which it is proper the "heart should be prepared"; as it is
requisite it should be to every good work by the grace of God so to
this: and then may it be said to be prepared for such service, when the
spirit of God is given as a spirit of grace and supplication, whereby
the heart is impressed with a sense of its wants, and so knows what to
pray for; and arguments and fit words are put into the mind and mouth,
and it knows how to pray as it should; and is enabled to approach the
throne of grace with sincerity, fervency, and in the exercise of faith,
being sprinkled from an evil conscience by the blood of Jesus, and
resigned to the divine will, in all its petitions it is directed to
make: now this is the work of God, to prepare the heart; the preparation
of the heart, as well as the answer of the tongue, is from the Lord; he
is prayed to for it, and it is affirmed he will do it, [Pro
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#001.md); but it is here represented as if
it was man's act, which is said not to suggest any power in man to do it
of himself; at least this is not the evangelic sense of such phrases;
for Zophar might be of a more legal spirit, and not so thoroughly
acquainted with the evangelic style; but this might be said, to show the
necessity of such a preparation, and to stir up to a concern for it, and
to expect and look for it from and by the grace of God.

If iniquity be in thine hand,.... For, as the heart must be prepared for
the stretching out of the hand in prayer to God, so it is not any hand
that is to be stretched out or lifted up unto God; not hands full of
blood, or defiled with sin, but holy hands; see [Isa
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#015.md), [Ti1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#008.md); it is not said, if iniquity be in
thine heart, or on thy conscience,

put it far away; for sin cannot be put away out of the heart, it will
have a place there as long as we live; though it should not be regarded,
cherished, and nourished there; if so, God will not hear prayer, [Psa
66:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#018.md); and nothing can put away or
remove afar off guilt from the conscience but the blood of Jesus; which,
being sprinkled, purifies the heart and purges the conscience from dead
works; but it is said, if it is in thine hand, which is the instrument
of action, and may signify the commission of sin, and a series and
course of sinning, which Job's friends suspected he was privately guilty
of; and therefore advise him to leave off such a sinful course, and
abstain from all appearance of evil, and live a holy and godly
conversation:

and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles; in any room or
apartment of his house; some restrain this, and iniquity in the former
clause, to ill gotten goods, obtained by rapine and oppression, which he
is advised to restore to those that had been injured by him; but there
is no need to limit it to any sin: besides, wickedness may be put for
wicked men, and the sense be, that, as he should not indulge to any
iniquity himself, so neither should he suffer wicked men to dwell in his
house, but make a general reformation in himself and in his family.

For then shall thou lift up thy face without spot,.... Either before
men, being in all good conscience, walking in all the commandments and
ordinances of the Lord, blameless, exercising a conscience void of
offence towards God and men; and so be able to say as Samuel did, "whose
ass have I taken?" &c. [Sa1 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#003.md); or
rather before God, as in [Job 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#026.md);
using an holy boldness and an humble confidence with him at the throne
of grace, in the view of the blood, righteousness, and sacrifice of his
living Redeemer he had knowledge of, as every true believer may; who,
though he is not without spot in himself, yet, being washed in the blood
of Christ, and clothed in his righteousness, he is all fair, and without
spot or wrinkle, or any such thing; and may stand before the throne
without fault, and appear before God, and in his sight, unblamable and
irreprovable:

yea, thou shalt be steadfast: firm and solid, rooted and grounded in the
love of God; having a firm persuasion of interest in it, and that
nothing shall separate from it; being built on the foundation of Christ,
and established in the exercise of faith on him; the affections being
steady towards him, and fixedly set on divine and heavenly things;
continuing steadfast in the doctrines of grace, and not carried about
with strange doctrines, or every wind of doctrine; as well as constant
and immovable in the work of the Lord, always employed in his service,
and doing his will, from which nothing can move; not reproach,
affliction, and persecution; and to be thus steady and fixed is a great
privilege:

and shalt not fear; evil tidings of evil times; of wars and rumours of
wars, famine, pestilence, earthquakes, and other judgments; of changes
and revolutions in kingdoms and states, or of what is coming upon the
world, according to promise and prophecy, the heart being fixed and well
established, trusting in the Lord; nor be afraid of evil men or devils,
or any enemies whatever, nor of death, the king of terrors, that being
one of the believer's blessings, and a friend of his; nor of hell and
damnation, or the second death, or wrath to come; from all which the
saints are secure.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 11:16</span></span>

Because thou shall forget thy misery,.... Former afflictions and
distresses; having an abundance of prosperity and happiness, and long
continued; and so, in process of time, the miseries and distresses
before endured are forgotten; thus it was with Joseph in his advanced
state, and therefore he called one of his sons Manasseh, [Gen
41:51](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#051.md); and as it is with convinced and
converted persons and believers in Christ, who, under first convictions
and awakenings, are filled with sorrow and distress, on a view of their
miserable estate by nature; but when Christ is revealed to them as their
Saviour and Redeemer, and the love of God is shed abroad in their
hearts, and they have faith and hope in Jesus, and a comfortable view of
heaven and happiness, and eternal life, by him, they forget their
spiritual poverty, and remember their misery no more, unless it be to
magnify the riches of the grace of God; see [Pro
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#006.md);

and remember it as waters that pass away; either the waters of the
stream in a river, which, when gone, are seen and remembered no more or
as waters occasioned by floods in the winter season, which when over,
and summer is come, are gone and are no more discerned; and as they pass
from the places where they were, so from the minds of men: or it may be
respect is had to the waters of Noah's flood, which, according to the
divine promise and oath, should no more go over the earth, [Gen
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#015.md); and being past and gone, and no
fear or danger of their returning, are forgotten.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 11:17</span></span>

And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday,.... That is, the
remainder of his days; the latter part of his life, which was yet to
come, should be no more attended with the darkness of adversity; but the
light of prosperity should shine upon him, and exceed the light of the
sun at noonday: the phrase is expressive of the wonderful change there
should be in his state and circumstances; see [Isa
58:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#010.md);

thou shall shine forth; like the rising sun, or as when it breaks forth
out of a cloud; in a temporal sense, it may be understood of his
enjoying health, wealth, and friends, the candle of the Lord shining
upon him, as in days past; and in a spiritual sense, of his being
favoured with the light of God's countenance, the Sun of righteousness
rising upon him, with healing in his wings; the graces of the Spirit
being brightened, and in lively exercise, and a large share of spiritual
light and knowledge being given: the word used has a contrary sense, and
signifies darkness and obscurity, and may be rendered "although thou
art", or hast been, or mayest "be dark" (x); under dark and afflictive
providences, as he had been, and still was and in darkness of soul,
under the hidings of God's face: yet

thou shall be as the morning; whose light breaks forth suddenly, and
makes everything gay and cheerful; especially a morning without clouds,
when it is bright and clear, and is increasing more and more: by this
metaphor is signified, that Job would at once emerge out of his
darkness, afflictions, and trouble, and have abundance of joy and
comfort, which would be increasing in every sense; see [Pro
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#018.md).

And thou shall be secure,.... From coming into like darkness,
difficulties, and distress again, and from every evil and enemy; nothing
shall come nigh to disturb and hurt, nothing to be feared from any
quarter, all around: or "shalt be confident" (y); have a strong faith
and full assurance of it, in the love of God, in the living Redeemer,
and in the promises which respect the life that now is, and that which
is to come:

because there is hope; of the mercy of God, of salvation by Christ, and
of eternal glory and happiness, as well as of a continuance of outward
prosperity; faith and hope mutually assist each other; faith is the
substance of things hoped for, and hope of better and future things on a
good foundation encourages faith and confidence:

yea, thou shalt dig about thee; to let in stakes for the pitching and
fixing of tents to dwell in, and for more commodious pasturage; or for
wells of water, for the supply both of the family and the flocks; or
rather, for ditches and trenches to secure from thieves and robbers, or
for drains to carry off floods of water:

and thou shalt take thy rest in safety; lie down on the bed and sleep in
the night season in peace and quietness, having nothing to fear; being
well entrenched, and secure from depredations and inundations; and, more
especially being hedged about and protected by the power and providence
of God; see [Psa 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#005.md); the Targum is,

"thou shall prepare a grave, and lie down, and sleep secure.''

Also thou shall lie down, and none shall make thee afraid,.... Either
lie down on his bed, as before, or by his flocks, and where they lie
down, and none should disturb him or them; not thieves and robbers, such
as the Chaldeans and Sabeans had been to him, nor lions, bears, and
wolves;

yea, many shall make suit unto thee; make their supplications, present
their requests and petitions for relief under necessitous circumstances,
or for protection from the injuries and insults of others; as the poor
and needy, the widow and fatherless, had done to him in times past, when
in his prosperity, and when he was a friend unto them, and the father of
them; see [Pro 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#006.md); or, "the great
ones (z) shall make suit to thee"; to have his favour and friendship,
his counsel and advice, his company and conversation; he should be
applied unto and courted by men of all sorts, which would be no small
honour to him; see [Psa 45:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#012.md).

But the eyes of the wicked shall fail,.... Either through grief and envy
at Job's prosperity, and with looking for his fall into troubles again;
or rather through expectation of good things for themselves, and for
deliverance out of trouble, but all in vain; see [Lam
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#017.md);

and they shall not escape; afflictions and calamities in this life, nor
the righteous judgment, nor wrath to come: or, "refuge shall perish from
them" (a); there will be none to betake themselves unto for safety; in
vain will they seek it from men; refuge will fail them, and no man care
for them; and in vain will they fly to rocks and mountains to fall upon
them:

and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost; it is with them
as when a man is just expiring, and it is all over with him, and there
is no hope of his reviving; so the hope of wicked men is a dying hope, a
lost hope; it is not hope, but despair; their hope is gone, and they are
lost and undone; and if they retain their hope in life, when they come
to die they have none; though the righteous has hope in his death, their
hope dies with them, if not before them: or, "their hope is the giving
up of the ghost" (b); all they have to hope and wish for is death, to
relieve them from their present troubles and agonies they are in; and
sometimes are left amidst their guilt, despair, and horror, to destroy
themselves: now Zophar by all this would suggest, that should not Job
take his advice, he would appear to be such a wicked man, whose eyes
would fail for his own help, and would not escape the judgments of God
here and hereafter, and would die without hope, in black despair; or at
least without any hope that would be of any avail.
