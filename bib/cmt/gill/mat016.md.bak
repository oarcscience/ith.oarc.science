### [Matthew Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 16:1</span></span>

The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, &c. Not from Jerusalem, as
in [Mat 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#001.md) but from the neighbouring
places: these were Galilean Sadducees and Pharisees, of whom mention is
made in the Misna (w);

"says , "a Galilean Sadducee", (i.e. one that was of the land of
Galilee, as Bartenora on the place observes,) I complain of you
Pharisees, because ye write the name of a ruler with the name of Moses,
in a divorce; say the Pharisees, we complain of you Galilean Sadducees,
that you write the name of a ruler with the name of God, in the same
leaf:''

but though these two sects could not agree in this, and in many other
things, yet they could unite against Christ, to whom they bore an
implacable hatred.

And tempting, desired him that he would show them a sign from heaven:
they came with no sincere view to be taught by him, or learn anything
from him; but if they could, to ensnare him, and get an opportunity of
exposing him to the people; and therefore pretending dissatisfaction
with the miracles he wrought on the earth, they ask of him to produce a
sign from heaven, of his coming from thence, of his being the Son of
God, and the true Messiah. They wanted some such sign, as the standing
still of the sun and moon, in the times of Joshua; and as raining manna,
in the times of Moses; or some such appearances of thunder and
lightning, as at the giving of the law. The appearance of the rainbow,
in a very extraordinary manner, is looked upon by the Jews as a sign of
the Messiah's coming (x).

"Says a certain Jew, when my father departed out of the world, he said
thus to me; do not look for the Messiah until thou seest the bow in the
world, adorned with light colours, and the world enlightened by it; then
look for the Messiah, as it is written, [Gen
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#016.md).''

Some very unusual and uncommon sight in the heavens, was what these men
asked of Christ in proof of his mission from God.

\(w\) Yadaim, c. 4. sect. 8. (x) Zohar in Gen. fol. 53. 2.

[Matthew 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 16:2</span></span>

He answered and said unto them,.... Knowing full well their views, and
having wrought sufficient miracles to confirm his Messiahship, he
thought fit to give them no other answer than this:

when it is evening, ye say, it will be fair weather, for the sky is red;
when the sun is setting, it is a common thing for you to say, looking up
to the heavens, and observing the face and colour of them, that it is
like to be fair weather; no rain, that night, nor perhaps the next day,
for the sky is red like fire, through the rays of the sun; which show
the clouds to be very thin, and so will soon waste away, and
consequently fine weather must follow.

[Matthew 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 16:3</span></span>

And in the morning, it will be foul weather today,.... When you rise in
the morning, and take a survey of the heavens, it is a very usual thing
with you to say, it is like to be windy or rainy weather today,

for the sky is red and lowring; which shows, that the clouds are so
thick that the sun cannot pierce through them, and its face is not seen;
so that it may be reasonably concluded they will issue in rain, or wind,
or both.

O ye hypocrites. The Vulgate Latin, and Munster's Hebrew Gospel, leave
out this appellation; but all other versions, as well as copies, have
it: and it is an usual epithet, bestowed very justly by Christ, on these
men; who pretended to be the guides of the people, took upon them to
teach and instruct them in divine things, and set up themselves as men
of great holiness, piety and knowledge; and yet, instead of searching
the Scriptures, and comparing the characters of the times of the Messiah
therein fixed, with the present ones, spent their time in making such
low and useless observations, and which fall within the compass of
everyone's knowledge and reach.

Ye can discern the face of the sky; very distinctly, and make some very
probable guesses, if not certain conclusions, what will follow, good
weather or bad:

but can ye not discern the signs of the times? or, as the Syriac reads
it, "the time", the present time: if they had not been blind, they might
easily have discerned, that the signs of the time of the Messiah's
coming were upon them, and that Jesus was the Messiah; as the departure
of the sceptre from Judah, the ending of Daniel's weeks, the various
miracles wrought by Christ, the wickedness of the age in which they
lived, the ministry of John the Baptist, and of Christ, the great
flockings of the people, both to one and to the other, with divers other
things which were easy to be observed by them: but they pretend this to
be a very great secret.

"The secret of the day of death, they say (y), and the secret of the day
when the king Messiah comes, who by his wisdom can find out?''

\(y\) Targum in Eccl. vii. 24.

[Matthew 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 16:4</span></span>

A wicked and adulterous generation,.... He says the same things here, as
he did to the Pharisees on a like occasion, in [Mat
12:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#039.md).

And he left them; as persons hardened, perverse, and incurable, and as
unworthy to be conversed with:

and departed: to the ship which brought him thither, and went in it to
the other side of the sea of Galilee; see [Mar
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#013.md).

[Matthew 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 16:5</span></span>

When his disciples were come to the other side,.... Of the sea, as
Munster's Hebrew Gospel adds, to Bethsaida, [Mar
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#022.md) as they were either in the ship,
or going from the shore to the said place, they recollected themselves,

that they had forgotten to take bread: having but one loaf, as Mark
says, in the ship; the seven baskets of fragments being either expended,
or given away to the poor, of their own accord, or by Christ's orders.
It seems, it was usual with the disciples to buy food at places most
proper, and carry with them; since Christ often went into deserts and
mountainous places, where provisions could not be had. This their
forgetfulness to act according to their wonted method, might arise
either from their being intent upon Christ's conversation with the
Pharisees, and Sadducees, or from the suddenness of Christ's departure.

[Matthew 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 16:6</span></span>

Then Jesus said unto them,.... Either taking occasion from the disciples
observing that they had forgot to take bread with them, or on account of
what passed between him and the Pharisees and Sadducees, he gave the
following advice to his disciples;

take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the
Sadducees. Mark, instead "of the leaven of the Sadducees", says, "the
leaven of Herod"; either because Christ might caution against all three;
or because the Sadducees were generally Herodians, taking Herod to be
the Messiah; or were on his party, or for his government, which the
Pharisees disliked; and the Herodians were generally Sadducees. By "the
leaven" of these is meant their doctrine, as appears from [Mat
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#012.md). The doctrines the Pharisees
taught were the commandments and inventions of men, the traditions of
the elders, free will, and justification by the works of the law: the
doctrine of the Sadducees was, that there was no resurrection of the
dead, nor angels, nor spirits: now because they sought secretly and
artfully to infuse their notions into the minds of men; and which, when
imbibed, spread their infection, and made men sour, morose, rigid, and
ill natured, and swelled and puffed them up with pride and vanity,
Christ compares them to leaven; and advises his disciples to look about
them, to watch, and be on their guard, lest they should be infected with
them.

[Matthew 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 16:7</span></span>

Either what should be the meaning of this caution of Christ's, and upon
what account he should say this to them; or they were anxiously
concerned what they should do for provision:

saying, because we have taken no bread; for the phrase, "it is", is a
supplement, and is not in the original text, which confines the sense to
the first way of interpretation; the words may be read without it, and
confirms the other sense, and which receives strength from what follows.

[Matthew 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 16:8</span></span>

Which when Jesus perceived,.... Without hearing any of their debates,
but by his omniscience; for he knew the doubts and unbelief, and anxious
solicitude of their minds, as well as their private reasonings one with
another:

he said unto them, O ye of little faith; a phrase used upon a like
occasion, when he would dissuade his disciples from an anxious
distressing care about a livelihood, [Mat
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#030.md); see Gill on [Mat
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#030.md),

why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?
blaming one another for your negligence and forgetfulness in this
matter; distressing your minds, as if you should be famished and
starved, because ye have not brought a quantity of bread, as you used to
do with you.

[Matthew 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 16:9</span></span>

Do ye not understand,.... Meaning either the sense of the advice he had
now given; or rather his almighty power displayed in the two miracles of
feeding five thousand at one time, and four thousand at another, with a
very small quantity of provision; for to this the word "understand"
refers, as well as the following:

neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many
baskets ye took up? Have you forgot what was so lately done, namely, the
feeding five thousand men, besides women and children, with five loaves
and two fishes, when ye took up, after all were filled and satisfied, no
less than twelve baskets of fragments? And can you, after this, distrust
my power in the care of you? Have I fed so many with so small a quantity
of food? and am I not able to feed twelve of you, though you have but
one loaf? Why all these anxious thoughts and carnal reasonings?

[Matthew 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 16:10</span></span>

Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand,.... Have you forgot the
other miracle done but a very little while ago, when I fed four thousand
men, beside women and children, with seven loaves and a few small
fishes;

and how many baskets ye took up? no less than seven large baskets; and
am I not able to provide for you? distress not yourselves about this
matter; give not way to unbelief, which must argue great stupidity and
insensibility.

[Matthew 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 16:11</span></span>

How is it that ye do not understand,.... That you should be so senseless
and void of thought, after such instances, as to imagine, that I
concerned myself about what bread you brought with you; one would think
you could not but know,

that I spake it not to you concerning bread, taken in a literal sense;
but must be thought to speak figuratively and mystically, and to have an
higher sense and meaning, when I said to you,

that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the
Sadducees; how could you think that I had any regard to the leaven taken
in a literal sense, the Pharisees and Sadducees approve or disapprove
of?

[Matthew 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 16:12</span></span>

Then understood they,.... Without any further explication of his sense
and meaning,

how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread: which sense
they first took him in; imagining, because the Pharisees were very
particular and precise what sort of leaven they made use of (z), that
Christ forbad them buying bread that was made with leaven according to
their directions: and since their rules in everything prevailed much in
all places, they were concerned what bread they must, or could buy; but
now they perceived that he did not speak of this, but of the doctrine of
the Pharisees and of the Sadducees. It was very common with the Jews (a)
to call the corruption and vitiosity of nature by the name of , "leaven
in the lump": hence our Lord calls their doctrine so, because it
proceeded from thence, and was agreeable thereunto; and uses the phrase
on purpose to expose it, and bring it into neglect and contempt.

[Matthew 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 16:13</span></span>

When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi,.... The towns that
were in the neighbourhood of this city; which city went by several names
before, as Leshem, [Jos 19:47](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#047.md) which
being taken by the Danites, they called it Dan; hence we read of "Dan,
which is Caesarea" (b). It was also called Paneas, from the name of the
fountain of Jordan, by which it was situated; and which Pliny says (c)
gave the surname to Caesarea; and hence it is called by Ptolomy (d)
Caesarea Paniae; and by the name of Paneas it went, when Philip the (e)
tetrarch rebuilt it, and called it Caesarea, in honour of Tiberius
Caesar; and from his own name, Philippi, to distinguish it from another
Caesarea, of which mention is made in the Acts of the Apostles, built by
his father Herod, and so called in honour of Augustus Caesar; which
before bore the name of Strato's tower. The Misnic doctors speak of two
Caesareas (f), the one they call the eastern, the other the western
Caesarea. Now, as Mark says, whilst Christ and his disciples were in the
way to these parts; and, as Luke, when he had been praying alone with
them,

he asked his disciples, saying, whom do men say that I the Son of man
am? He calls himself "the son of man", because he was truly and really
man; and because of his low estate, and the infirmities of human nature,
with which he was encompassed: he may have some respect to the first
intimation of him, as the seed of woman, and the rather make use of this
phrase, because the Messiah was sometimes designed by it in the Old
Testament, [Psa 80:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#017.md) or Christ speaks
here of himself, according to his outward appearance, and the prevailing
opinion of men concerning him; that he looked to be only a mere man,
born as other men were; was properly a son of man, and no more: and
therefore the question is, not what sort of man he was, whether a holy,
good man, or not, or whether the Messiah, or not; but the question is,
what men in general, whether high or low, rich or poor, learned or
unlearned, under the notion they had of him as a mere man, said of him;
or since they took him to be but a man, what man they thought he was;
and to this the answer is very appropriate. This question Christ put to
his disciples, they being more conversant with the people than he, and
heard the different opinions men had of him, and who were more free to
speak their minds of him to them, than to himself; not that he was
ignorant of what passed among men, and the different sentiments they had
of him, but he was willing to hear the account from his disciples; and
his view in putting this question to them, was to make way for another,
in order to bring them to an ingenuous confession of their faith in him.

[Matthew 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 16:14</span></span>

And they said, some say that thou art John the Baptist,.... It was the
opinion of some of the Jews, that he was John the Baptist risen from the
dead. This notion was spread, and prevailed in Herod's court, and he
himself, at last, gave into it.

Some Elias; the Tishbite, because an extraordinary person was prophesied
of by Malachi, under the name of Elias; and who was to come in his power
and spirit before the great day of the Lord; and it being a prevailing
notion with the Jews, that Elias was to come before the Messiah; See
Gill on [Mat 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#014.md) they concluded that
he was now come:

and others Jeremias; this is omitted both by Mark and Luke; the reason
why he is mentioned, is not because of what is said of him, in [Jer
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#005.md) but because the Jews thought he
was that prophet spoken of, in [Deu
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015.md) that should be raised up from
among them, like unto Moses: and this is the sense of some of their
writers (g): and in their very ancient writings a parallel is run
between Moses and Jeremy (h).

"R. Judah, the son of R. Simon, opened [Deu
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#018.md) thus: "as thee", this is
Jeremiah, who was, as he, in reproofs; you will find all that is written
of the one, is written of the other; one prophesied forty years, and the
other prophesied forty years; the one prophesied concerning Judah and
Israel, and the other prophesied concerning Judah and Israel; against
the one those of his own tribe stood up, and against the other those of
his own tribe stood up; the one was cast into a river, and the other
into a dungeon; the one was delivered by means of an handmaid, and the
other by the means of a servant; the one came with words of reproof, and
the other came with words of reproof.''

Now they fancied, either that the soul of Jeremy was transmigrated into
another body, or that he was risen from the dead.

Or one of the prophets; one of the ancient ones, as Hosea, or Isaiah, or
some other: they could not fix upon the particular person who they
thought was risen from the dead, and did these wondrous works among
them. From the whole it appears, that these persons, whose different
sentiments of Christ are here delivered, were not his sworn enemies, as
the Scribes and Pharisees, who could never speak respectfully of him;
saying, that he was a gluttonous man, a winebibber, a friend of
publicans and sinners, a very wicked man, and far from being one, or
like one of the prophets: they sometimes represent him as beside
himself, and mad, yea, as being a Samaritan, and having a devil, as
familiar with the devil, and doing his miracles by his assistance; but
these were the common people, the multitude that followed Christ from
place to place, and had a great opinion of him on account of his
ministry, and miracles: wherefore, though they could not agree in their
notions concerning him, yet each of them fix upon some person of note
and worth, whom they took him for; they all looked upon him as a great
and good man, and as a prophet, as John the Baptist was accounted by all
the people, and as one of the chief of the prophets, as Elias and
Jeremiah; and they that could not fix on any particular person, yet put
him into the class of the prophets: but still they came short of the
true knowledge of him; they did not know him to be a divine person,
which his works and miracles proved him to be: nor to be that prophet
Moses had spoken of, who was alone to be hearkened unto, though his
ministry was a demonstration of it: nor that he was the Messiah, so much
spoken of in prophecy, and so long expected by the Jewish nation, though
he had all the characters of the Messiah meeting in him. The chief
reason why they could not entertain such a thought of him, seems to be
the mean figure he made in the world, being of a low extract, in strait
circumstances of life, regarded only by the poorer sort; and there
appearing nothing in him promising, that he should deliver them from the
Roman yoke, and set up a temporal kingdom, which should be prosperous
and flourishing, which was the notion of the Messiah that then generally
obtained: and since they could not, by any means, allow of this
character as belonging to Jesus, though otherwise they had an high
opinion of him; hence they could not agree about him, but formed
different sentiments of him; which is usually the case in everything,
where the truth is not hit upon and received.

[Matthew 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 16:15</span></span>

He saith unto them, but whom say ye that I am? Without taking any
further notice, or making any reflections on the different sentiments of
men concerning him, he put this question to his disciples, and which is
what he had chiefly in view, that he might have their sense of him; and
which he puts in a different form, and leaves out the phrase, the son of
man, because they knew he was more than a man: nor was his mean
appearance an offence to them; they had believed in him, became his
disciples, and were followers of him: but it was not enough to believe
in him, they must confess him; both are necessary: therefore he does not
say, whom believe ye, but whom say ye that I am? You who have been with
me so long from the beginning; you who have heard so many discourses
from me, and have seen so many miracles wrought by me; and who are to be
the teachers of others, to preach my Gospel, and publish my salvation to
Jews and Gentiles, what have you to say of me? Whom do you say I am? as
for those men, it is no great matter who they say I am; but of great
moment and consequence are your sense and confession of me. Such who
have long sat under a Gospel ministry, or who have been long in the
church and school of Christ, it is expected of them, that they should
know more of Christ than others; and should be come to a point about his
person and office, and be ready to make a confession of their faith, and
give a reason of their hope in him; and especially such who are, or are
to be preachers of Christ to others: these ought to be well acquainted
with him, who, and what he is; they should have no doubt, nor hesitation
in their minds, about him, but be fully satisfied concerning him; and be
free, and open, and ready to declare what they know and believe of him.

[Matthew 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 16:16</span></span>

And Simon Peter answered and said,.... Either of his own accord, and for
himself, being a warm, zealous, and forward man; one that dearly loved
Christ, truly believed in him, and was ready to make a confession of
him; or, as the mouth of the rest, in their name, and with their
consent; or, at least, as full well knowing the sentiments of their
minds. Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God: a short, but a very
full confession of faith, containing the following articles: as that
there is a God, that there is but one God; that he is the living God,
has life in himself, is the fountain of life to others, and by this is
distinguishable from the idols of the Gentiles: that Jesus is the
Christ, the Christ of God, the true Messiah, that was promised by God,
prophesied of by all the prophets, from the beginning of the world, and
expected by the people of God: a character that includes all his
offices, of prophet, priest, and king, to which he is anointed by God;
and that this Messiah was not a mere man, but a divine person, the Son
of God; not by creation, as angels and men are, nor by adoption, as
saints, nor by office, as magistrates, but by nature, being his own Son,
his proper Son, the only begotten of the Father, of the same nature with
him, being one with him, and equal to him. This confession, as it is
uniform, and all of a piece, and consistent with itself, and is what all
the disciples of Christ agreed in, so it greatly exceeds the most that
can be made of the different sentiments of the people put together. They
took him, one and all, to be but a mere man; their most exalted thoughts
of him rose no higher: but in this he is acknowledged to be the Son of
God, a phrase expressive of his divine nature, and distinct personality:
they thought him to be a dead man brought to life; but here he is called
the Son of the living God, as having the same life in him the Father
has: they indeed judged him to be a prophet, but not that prophet that
was to come, superior to all prophets; but here he is owned to be the
Christ, which not only takes in his prophetic office in a higher sense
than they understood it, but all his other offices, and declares him to
be the promised Messiah; which they who thought, and spoke the most
honourably of him, could not allow of.

[Matthew 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 16:17</span></span>

And Jesus answered and said unto him,.... Not waiting for any other
declaration from them; but taking this to be the sense of them all, he
said,

blessed art thou Simon Bar Jona, or son of Jona, or Jonas, as in [Joh
1:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#042.md). His father's name was Jonah,
whence he was so called: so we read (i) of R. Bo bar Jonah, and of a
Rabbi of this very name (k), , Rabbi Simeon bar Jona; for Simon and
Simeon are one, and the same name. Some read it Bar Joanna, the same
with John; but the common reading is best; Bar Jona signifies "the son
of a dove", and Bar Joanna signifies "the son of one that is gracious".
Our Lord, by this appellation, puts Peter in mind of his birth and
parentage, but does not pronounce him blessed on that account: no true
blessedness comes by natural descent; men are by nature children of
wrath, being conceived in sin, and shapen in iniquity: though he was Bar
Jona, the son of a dove, and his father might be a good man, and answer
to his name, and be of a dove like spirit; yet such a spirit was not
conveyed from him to Peter by natural generation: and though he might
be, according to the other reading, Bar Joanna, or the son of a gracious
man, yet grace was not communicated to him thereby; for he was not "born
of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of
God", [Joh 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#013.md). He was a blessed man,
not by his first, but by his second birth; and the reason why our Lord
makes mention of his father, is to observe to him, that he was the son
of a mean man, and had had, but a mean education, and therefore his
blessedness in general was not of nature, but of grace, and this branch
of it in particular; the knowledge he had of the Messiah, was not owing
to his earthly father, or to the advantage of an education, but to the
revelation he had from Christ's Father which is in heaven, as is
hereafter affirmed. He is pronounced "blessed", as having a true
knowledge of God, and of his Son Jesus Christ, whom to know is life
eternal; and all such as he are so, appear to be the favourites of God,
to have an interest in Christ and in all the blessings of his grace; are
justified by his righteousness, pardoned through his blood, are accepted
in him, have communion with Father, Son, and Spirit, and shall live
eternally with them hereafter.

For flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee: nothing is more
frequent to be met with in Jewish writings, than the phrase of "flesh
and blood", as designing men in distinction from God: so the first man
is said (l) to be

"the workmanship of the blessed God, and not the workmanship , "of flesh
and blood".''

Again (m), , "flesh and blood", who knows not the times and seasons, &c.
but the holy, blessed God, who knows the times and seasons, &c.
Instances of this way of speaking are almost without number:
accordingly, the sense here is, that this excellent confession of faith,
which Peter had delivered, was not revealed unto him, nor taught him by
any mere man; he had not it from his immediate parents, nor from any of
his relations, or countrymen; nor did he attain to the knowledge of what
is expressed in it, by the dint of nature, by the strength of carnal
reason, or the force of his own capacity and abilities:

but my Father which is in heaven; from whom both the external and
internal revelation of such truths come; though not to the exclusion of
the Son, by whose revelation the Gospel is taught, and received; nor of
the Holy Ghost, who is a Spirit of wisdom and revelation, but in
opposition to, and distinction from any mere creature whatever. Neither
the Gospel, nor any part of it, is an human device or discovery; it is
not after man, nor according to the carnal reason of man; it is above
the most exalted and refined reason of men; it has in it what eye has
not seen, nor ear heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man to
conceive of: its truths are the deep things of God, which the Spirit of
God searches and reveals: and which men, left to the light of nature,
and force of reason, must have been for ever ignorant of, and could
never have discovered. The Gospel is a revelation, it consists of
revealed truths; and which are to be received and believed upon the
testimony and credit of the revealer, without entering into carnal
reasonings, and disputes about them; and it is the highest reason, and
the most noble use of reason, to embrace it at once, as coming from God;
for this revelation is from heaven, and from Christ's Father;
particularly the deity, sonship, and Messiahship of Christ, are
doctrines of pure revelation: that there is a God, is discoverable by
the light of nature; and that he is the living God, and gives being, and
life, and breath, and all things, to his creatures; but that he has a
Son of the same nature with him, and equal to him, who is the Messiah,
and the Saviour of lost sinners, this could never have been found out by
flesh and blood: no man knows the Son, but the Father, and he to whom he
reveals him; he bears witness of him, and declares him to be his Son, in
whom he is well pleased; and happy are those who are blessed with the
outward revelation of Jesus Christ in the Gospel, but more especially
such to whom the Father reveals Christ in them the hope of glory!

And I say also unto thee,.... Either besides what he had already said
concerning his happiness; or, as the father had revealed something great
and valuable, so likewise would he; or inasmuch as he had freely said
and declared who, and what he was, in like manner he also would say what
Peter was, thou art Peter: intimating, that he was rightly called Peter,
or Cephas, by him, when he first became a follower of him, [Mat
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#018.md), which words signify the same
thing, a rock, or stone; because of his firmness and solidity, and
because he was laid upon the sure foundation, and built on the rock
Christ, and was a very fit stone to be laid in the spiritual building.
The aptness of this name to him is easy to be seen in his full assurance
of faith, as to the person of Christ, and his free, open, and undaunted
confession of him.

And upon this rock will I build my church: by the church, is meant, not
an edifice of wood, stones, &c. but an assembly, and congregation of
men; and that not of any sort; not a disorderly, tumultuous assembly, in
which sense this word is sometimes taken; nor does it design the
faithful of a family, which is sometimes the import of it; nor a
particular congregated church, but the elect of God, the general
assembly and church of the first born, whose names are written in
heaven; and especially such of them as were to be gathered in, and built
on Christ, from among the Jews and Gentiles. The materials of this
building are such, as are by nature no better, or more fit for it, than
others: these stones originally lie in the same quarry with others; they
are singled out, and separated from the rest, according to the sovereign
will of God, by powerful and efficacious grace; and are broken and hewn
by the Spirit of God, generally speaking, under the ministry of the
word, and are, by him, made living stones; and being holy and spiritual
persons, are built up a spiritual house: and these are the only persons
which make up the true and invisible church of Christ in the issue, and
are only fit to be members of the visible church; and all such ought to
be in a Gospel church state, and partake of the privileges of it: these
materials are of different sorts, and have a different place, and have a
different usefulness in this building; some are only as common stones,
and timber; others are as pillars, beams, and rafters; and all are
useful and serviceable; and being put, and knit together, grow up as an
holy temple to the Lord: and are called, by Christ, "my" church, because
given him by the Father; and he has purchased them with his own blood;
are built by him, and on him; inhabited by him, and of whom he is the
head, king, and governor; though not to the exclusion of the Father,
whose house they also are; nor of the Spirit, who dwells in them, as in
his temple. This church Christ promises to "build". Though his ministers
are builders, they are but under builders; they are qualified, employed,
directed, encouraged, and succeeded by him; he is the wise, able, and
chief master builder. This act of building seems to have a special
regard to the conversion of God's elect, both among Jews and Gentiles,
particularly the latter; and to the daily conversions of them in all
ages; and to the building up of saints in faith and holiness; each of
which will more manifestly appear in the latter day; and are both
generally effected through the word, and ordinances, as means, the
Spirit of Christ blessing them. By the rock on which Christ builds his
church, is meant, not the person of Peter; for Christ does not say, upon
thee Peter, but upon this rock, referring to something distinct from
him: for though his name signifies a rock, or stone, and there may be
some allusion to it; and he is so called because of his trust and
confidence in the Lord, on whom he was built; but not because he was the
foundation on which any others, and especially the whole church, were
built: it is true, he may be called the foundation, as the rest of the
twelve apostles of the Lamb are, [Eph
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020.md) without any distinction from
them, and preference to them; they and he agreeing in laying doctrinally
and ministerially Christ Jesus as the foundation of faith and hope, but
not in such sense as he is; neither he, nor they, are the foundation on
which the church is built, which is Christ, and him only. Moreover, what
is said to Peter in these, and the following words, is not said to him
personally and separately from the rest of the apostles, but is designed
for them, as well as him, as appears by comparing them with [Mat
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#018.md). As he spoke in the name of them
all, to Christ; so Christ spake to him, including them all. Peter had no
preeminence over the rest of the apostles, which he neither assumed, nor
was it granted; nor would it ever have been connived at by Christ, who
often showed his resentment at such a spirit and conduct, whenever there
was any appearance of it in any of them; see [Mat
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#001.md) and though Peter, with James, and
John, had some particular favours bestowed on him by Christ; as to be at
the raising of Jairus's daughter, and at the transfiguration of Christ
on the mount, and with him in the garden; and he appeared to him alone
after his resurrection, and before he was seen by the rest of the
disciples; yet in some things he was inferior to them, being left to
deny his Lord and master, they did not; and upon another account is
called Satan by Christ, which they never were; not to mention other
infirmities of his, which show he is not the rock: and, after all, what
is this to the pope of Rome, who is no successor of Peter's? Peter, as
an apostle, had no successor in his office; nor was he bishop of Rome;
nor has the pope of Rome either his office, or his doctrine: but here,
by the rock, is meant, either the confession of faith made by Peter; not
the act, nor form, but the matter of it, it containing the prime
articles of Christianity, and which are as immoveable as a rock; or
rather Christ himself, who points, as it were, with his finger to
himself, and whom Peter had made such a glorious confession of; and who
was prefigured by the rock the Israelites drank water out of in the
wilderness; and is comparable to any rock for height, shelter, strength,
firmness, and duration; and is the one and only foundation of his church
and people, and on whom their security, salvation, and happiness
entirely depend. Christ is a rock that is higher than they, where they
find safety in times of distress, and the shadow of which is refreshing
to them; and therefore betake themselves to him for shelter, and where
they are secure from the wrath of God, and rage of men: he is the rock
of ages, in whom is everlasting strength; and is the sure, firm, and
everlasting foundation on which the church, and all true believers, are
laid: he is the foundation of their faith, and hope, and everlasting
happiness, and will ever continue; and the gates of hell shall not
prevail against it. The Jews speak of the gates of hell: sometimes of
the gate of hell, in the singular number (p); and sometimes of the gates
of hell, in the plural number. They say (q), that

"Mnhygl vy Myxtp hvlv, "hell has three gates", one in the wilderness,
one in the sea, and one in Jerusalem.''

They talk (r) of

"an angel that is appointed , "over the gates of hell", whose name is
Samriel; who has three keys in his hands, and opens three doors.''

And elsewhere (s) they say, that

"he that is appointed over hell his name is Dumah, and many myriads of
destroying angels are with him, and he stands , "at the gate of hell";
and all those that keep the holy covenant in this world, he has no power
to bring them in.''

Our Lord may allude to these notions of the Jews, and his sense be, that
all the infernal principalities and powers, with all their united
cunning and strength, will never be able to extirpate his Gospel, to
destroy his interest, to demolish his church in general, or ruin anyone
particular soul that is built upon him. Again, the gates of "Hades", or
hell, sometimes seem to design no other than the gates of death, and the
grave, and persons going into the state of death; see [Job
38:17](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#017.md) where the Septuagint use the
same phrase as here; and then the sense is, that neither death, nor the
grave, shall finally, and totally prevail over the people of God, and
members of Christ; but they shall be raised out of such a state, and
live gloriously with him for ever. By it here is not meant Peter
himself; though it is true of him, that Satan, and his posse of devils
that beset him, did not prevail against him, so as to destroy his grace,
hurt his estate, and hinder his salvation: nor could death, in all its
frightful appearances, deter him from holding, and preaching, and
maintaining the doctrine of Christ; and though death, and the grave,
have now power over him, yet they shall not always detain him: but
rather, it designs the doctrine Peter made a confession of; which,
though it may be opposed by hell and earth, by Satan, and his
emissaries, by the open force of persecutors, and the secret fraud of
heretics, it may be brought into contempt by the scandalous lives of
professors; and though the true professors of it may die off, yet truth
itself always lives, and defies the power of death, and the grave: or
else the church in general is meant, and every true believer. These
words do not ascertain the continuance of anyone particular congregated
church, but secures the church universal, which will continue as long as
the sun and moon endure, and the perseverance of everyone of God's
elect; and assure that death, and the grave, shall not always have the
dominion over the saints, but that they shall be rescued from them. Once
more, this "it" may refer to Christ the rock, who, though he was brought
to the dust of death, by the means of Satan, and the powers of darkness,
yet to the ruin of him that had the power of death; and though death,
and the grave, had power over him for a while, yet could not hold him;
he rose victorious over them, and ever lives, having the keys of hell
and death, to open the gates thereof, and let his people out when he
thinks fit.

[Matthew 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 16:19</span></span>

And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven,.... By the
kingdom of heaven is meant the Gospel, which comes from heaven, declares
the king Messiah to be come, speaks of things concerning his kingdom, is
the means of setting it up, and enlarging it, displays the riches of his
grace, and gives an account of the kingdom of heaven, and of persons'
right unto it, and meetness for it. "The keys" of it are abilities to
open and explain the Gospel truths, and a mission and commission from
Christ to make use of them; and being said to be given to Peter
particularly, denotes his after qualifications, commission, work, and
usefulness in opening the door of faith, or preaching the Gospel first
to the Jews, [Act 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#001.md) and then to the
Gentiles, [Act 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#001.md) and who was the
first that made use of the keys of evangelical knowledge with respect to
both, after he, with the rest of the apostles, had received an enlarged
commission to preach the Gospel to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
Otherwise these keys belonged to them all alike; for to the same persons
the keys, and the use of them, appertained, on whom the power of binding
and loosing was bestowed; and this latter all the disciples had, as is
manifest from [Mat 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#018.md) wherefore
this does not serve to establish the primacy and power of Peter over the
rest of the apostles; nor do keys design any lordly domination or
authority; nor did Christ allow of any such among his apostles; nor is
it his will that the ministers of his word should lord it over his
heritage: he only is king of saints, and head of his church; he has the
key of David, with which he opens, and no man shuts, and shuts, and no
man opens; and this he keeps in his own hand, and gives it to none.
Peter is not the door-keeper of heaven to let in, nor keep out, whom he
pleases; nor has his pretended successor the keys of hell and death;
these also are only in Christ's hands: though it has been said of the
pope of Rome, that if he sends millions of men to hell, none should say
to him, what dost thou? but the keys here mentioned are the keys of the
kingdom of heaven; or of the Gospel, which was shut up in the Jewish
nation, through the ignorance, malice, and calumnies of the Scribes and
Pharisees, who would neither embrace it, or enter into the kingdom of
God themselves, nor suffer others that were going to enter into it; and
through their taking away the key of knowledge, or the right
interpretation of the word of God; and through a judicial blindness,
which that nation in general was given up to: and this was shut up to
the Gentiles through the natural darkness that was spread over them, and
through want of a divine revelation, and persons sent of God to instruct
them: but now Christ was about, and in a little time he would (for these
words, with what follow, are in the future tense) give his apostles both
a commission and gifts, qualifying them to open the sealed book of the
Gospel, and unlock the mysteries of it, both to Jews and Gentiles,
especially the latter. Keys are the ensigns of treasurers, and of
stewards, and such the ministers of the Gospel are; they have the rich
treasure of the word under their care, put into their earthen vessels to
open and lay before others; and they are stewards of the mysteries and
manifold grace of God, and of these things they have the keys. So that
these words have nothing to do with church power and government in
Peter, nor in the pope, nor in any other man, or set of men whatever;
nor to be understood of church censures, excommunications, admissions,
or exclusions of members: nor indeed are keys of any such similar use;
they serve for locking and unlocking doors, and so for keeping out those
that are without, and retaining those that are within, but not for the
expulsion of any: but here they are used in a figurative sense, for the
opening and explaining the truths of the Gospel, for which Peter had
excellent gifts and abilities.

And whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven: and
whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven. This
also is not to be understood of binding, or loosing men's sins, by
laying on, or taking off censures, and excommunications; but only of
doctrines, or declarations of what is lawful and unlawful, free, or
prohibited to be received, or practised; in which sense the words, ,
"bound and loosed", are used in the Talmudic writings, times without
number, for that which is forbidden and declared to be unlawful, and for
that which is free of use, and pronounced to be so: in multitudes of
places we read of one Rabbi "binding", and of another "loosing";
thousands, and ten thousands of instances of this kind might be
produced; a whole volume of extracts on this head might be compiled. Dr.
Lightfoot has transcribed a great many, sufficient to satisfy any man,
and give him the true sense of these phrases; and after him to mention
any other is needless; yet give me leave to produce one, as it is short,
and full, and explains these phrases, and points at the persons that had
this power, explaining [Ecc 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#011.md) and
that clause in it, "masters of the assemblies".

"these (say they (t)) are the disciples of the wise men, who sit in
different collections, and study in the law; these pronounce things or
persons defiled, and these pronounce things or persons clean, "these
bind, and these loose"; these reject, or pronounce persons or things
profane, and these declare them right.''

And a little after,

"get thyself an heart to hear the words of them that pronounce unclean,
and the words of them that pronounce clean; the words of them that
"bind", and the words of them that "loose"; the words of them that
reject, and the words of them that declare it right''

But Christ gave a greater power of binding and loosing, to his
disciples, than these men had, and which they used to better purpose.
The sense of the words is this, that Peter, and so the rest of the
apostles, should be empowered with authority from him, and so directed
by his Holy Spirit, that whatever they bound, that is, declared to be
forbidden, and unlawful, should be so: and that whatever they loosed,
that is, declared to be lawful, and free of use, should be so; and
accordingly they bound some things which before were loosed, and loosed
some things which before were bound; for instance, they bound, that is,
prohibited, or declared unlawful, the use of circumcision, which before,
and until the death of Christ, was enjoined the natural seed of Abraham;
but that, and all ceremonies, being abolished by the death of Christ,
they declared it to be nothing, and of no avail, yea, hurtful and
pernicious; that whoever was circumcised, Christ profited him nothing,
and that he was a debtor to do the whole law: they affirmed, that the
believing Gentiles were not to be troubled with it; that it was a yoke
not fit to be put upon their necks, which they, and their fathers, were
not able to bear, [Gal 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#001.md). They
bound, or forbid the observance of days, months, times, and years; the
keeping holy days, new moons, and sabbaths, which had been used in the
Jewish church for ages past; such as the first day of the new year, and
of every month, the day of atonement, the feasts of the passover,
pentecost, and tabernacles, the jubilee year, the sabbatical year, and
seventh day sabbath, [Gal 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009.md). They
loosed, or declared lawful and free, both civil and religious
conversation between Jews and Gentiles; whereas, before, the Jews had no
dealings with the Gentiles, nor would not enter into their houses, nor
keep company with them, would have no conversation with them; neither
eat, nor drink with them; but now it was determined and declared, that
no man should be called common, or unclean; and that in Christ Jesus,
and in his church, there is no distinction of Jew and Gentile, [Act
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#028.md). They also loosed, or pronounced
lawful, the eating of any sort of food, without distinction, even that
which was before counted common and unclean, being persuaded by the Lord
Jesus Christ, by the words he said, [Mat
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#011.md). They asserted, that there is
nothing unclean of itself; and that the kingdom of God is not meat and
drink; or that true religion does not lie in the observance of those
things; that every creature of God is good, and fit for food, and
nothing to be refused, or abstained from, on a religious account,
provided it be received with thanksgiving, [Rom
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#014.md). And these things now being by
them bound or loosed, pronounced unlawful or lawful, are confirmed as
such by the authority of God, and are so to be considered by us.

[Matthew 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mat 16:20</span></span>

Then charged he his disciples,.... When Peter had so freely and fully
confessed him to be the Messiah, and which was the sense of all the
disciples; and when Christ had expressed his approbation of his
confession, and had promised such great and excellent things upon it, he
gave a strict charge unto his disciples,

that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ. The word
Jesus is not in some copies; and is left out in the Syriac, Arabic, and
Persic versions; nor does it seem absolutely necessary; it was enough to
charge them to tell no man that he was the Messiah: his reasons for it
might be, lest his enemies, the Scribes and Pharisees, should be the
more provoked and incensed against him, and seek his death before his
time; and lest the jealousy of the Romans should be stirred up, who
might fear he would set up himself against Caesar, as king of the Jews,
which might lead them to take measures obstructive of his further
designs; and lest some persons, hearing of this, should rise and
proclaim him king of the Jews, who were big with the notion of the
Messiah being a temporal prince: and moreover, because the disciples
were to attest the truth of this after his resurrection; and he chose,
for the present, that the people should collect this from his own
ministry and miracles, which were sufficient to lead them into the
knowledge of it, without any declarations of their's: and though they
were possessed of true faith in him, as such, for themselves, as yet
they had not the gifts and abilities to defend those doctrines
respecting his person, and his offices, they had after the Spirit was
poured down upon them.

[Matthew 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 16:21</span></span>

From that time forth began Jesus to show unto his disciples,.... From
the time that Peter made the confession concerning Jesus, as that he was
the Messiah, and Son of God, and which things were clear to all the
apostles, he began to teach them more expressly, and to point out to
them more clearly, and plainly, his sufferings and death, than he had
done before: and this he chose to do now, partly because that their
faith in him was well grounded and established, so that they were the
better able to bear these things he told them, which before might have
been more staggering and discouraging to them; and partly, that being
forewarned of them, they would not be so shocking when they came to
pass: as also to destroy all their expectations of a temporal kingdom,
which they might now be big with, he having so fully and freely owned
himself to be the Messiah: and this also furnishes out some reasons why
Jesus would not have his disciples, for the present, declare him to be
the Messiah, that his death might not, by any means, be prevented, which
was so necessary; since, should the princes of the world know him, they
would not crucify him: and besides, seeing he was to suffer, and die,
and rise again for the salvation of his people, it was proper that all
this should be over before he was so publicly declared to be the
Messiah, the Saviour, and Redeemer.

How that he must go to Jerusalem: the metropolis of the nation, where
the great sanhedrim sat, who only could take cognizance of him, under
the imputation of a false prophet, and condemn him to death, and which
therefore would be in the most public manner; and though it would add to
his reproach, would leave no room to be doubted of. The word "must", not
only belongs to his going to Jerusalem, but to his sufferings, death,
and resurrection; all which must be because of the immutable decree of
God, the council, and covenant of grace, and peace, the prophecies of
the Old Testament, and the redemption and salvation of God's elect;
these required them, and made them absolutely necessary:

and suffer many things of the elders, chief priests, and Scribes: who
would lie in wait for him, send persons to apprehend him, insult,
reproach, and despitefully use him; load him with false charges,
accusations, and calumnies, and deliver him to the Gentiles, to be
mocked, scourged, and crucified: and this is aggravated as what would be
done to him, not by the common people, or the dregs of them, but by the
principal men of the city, by the sanhedrim, which consisted of the
"elders" of the people, their senators; for this is not a name of age,
but of office and dignity; and of the "chief priests", the principal of
them, those of the greatest note among them, who were chosen members of
the grand council; and of "the Scribes", a set of men in high esteem for
their learning and wisdom:

and be killed; signifying, that he should not die a natural death, but
that his life should be taken from him in a cruel and violent manner,
without any regard to law or justice; indeed, that he should be properly
murdered; but for the comfort of his disciples, and that they might not
be overmuch pressed and cast down, at the hearing of these things, he
adds,

and be raised again the third day according to the Scriptures of the Old
Testament, and the type of Jonas.

[Matthew 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mat 16:22</span></span>

Then Peter took him,.... The Arabic version reads it, "called to him":
the Ethiopic, "answered him"; and the Syriac, "led him"; he took him
aside, by himself; and as the Persic version, "privately said to him",
or he took him by the hand in a familiar way, to expostulate with him,
and dissuade him from thinking and talking of any such things;

and began to rebuke him: reprove and chide him, forgetting himself and
his distance; though he did it not out of passion and ill will, but out
of tenderness and respect; looking upon what Christ had said, unworthy
of him, and as what was scarce probable or possible should ever befall
him, who was the Son of the living God, and overlooking his resurrection
from the dead, and being ignorant at present of the end of Christ's
coming into the world, and redemption and salvation by his sufferings
and death:

saying, far be it from thee, Lord, or "Lord, be propitious to thyself",
or "spare thyself": the phrase answers to , often used by the Targumists
(u) and stands in the Syriac version here. The Septuagint use it in a
like sense, in [Gen 43:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#023.md). Some think
the word "God" is to be understood, and the words to be considered,
either as a wish, "God be propitious to thee": or "spare thee", that no
such thing may ever befall thee; or as an affirmation, "God is
propitious to thee", he is not angry and displeased with thee, as ever
to suffer any such thing to be done to thee: but it may very well be
rendered, by "God forbid"; or as we do, "far be it from thee", as a note
of aversion, and abhorrence of the thing spoken of:

this shall not be done unto thee: expressing his full assurance of it,
and his resolution to do all that in him lay to hinder it: he could not
see how such an innocent person could be so used by the chief men of the
nation; and that the Messiah, from whom so much happiness was expected,
could be treated in such a manner, and especially that the Son of the
living God should be killed.

[Matthew 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 16:23</span></span>

But he turned,.... Either to Peter, changing his countenance, and
looking sternly upon him, or rather to the disciples; for Mark says,
"when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked
Peter": Peter had took him aside, and was arguing the case privately
with him; but what he said was so offensive to him, that he chose to
reprove him publicly before the disciples; and therefore turned himself
from him to them, in a way of resentment,

and said unto Peter; in their hearing, and before them all,

get thee behind me, Satan. The Persic version renders it, O infidel! as
he was at present, with respect to the sufferings, death, and
resurrection of Christ: some take the word Satan, to be a general name
for an adversary, or enemy, as it is used in [Sa2
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#022.md) and think that Christ calls
Peter by this name, because he was against him, and opposed him in this
point; which sense abates the harshness of this expression. But it seems
rather to mean the devil, who took the advantage of Peter's weakness and
ignorance; and put him upon dissuading Christ from suffering, for the
salvation of his people: though it should be known, that the word Satan,
is used by the, Jews (w), to signify the vitiosity and corruption of
nature; of which they say, , this is Satan; so the messenger, or angel
Satan, [Co2 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007.md) may be thought to be
the same; See Gill on [Co2 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007.md) And
then our Lord's sense is, be gone from me, I cannot bear the sight of
thee; thou art under the influence of the corruption of thy heart, and
nature; thou talkest like a carnal, and not like a spiritual man; and
therefore Christ denominates him from his carnality, Satan, one of the
names of the vitiosity of nature, whom a little before he had pronounced
blessed; being then under the influence of another spirit, as appeared
from the noble confession of his faith in Christ: this change shows the
weakness of human nature, the strength of corruption, the inconstancy
and fickleness of frames, and the imperfection of grace in the best of
saints.

Thou art an offence unto me; or a stumbling block to me, a cause of
stumbling and failing; not that he really was, but he endeavoured to be,
and was as much as in him lay; and had he given heed unto him, would
have been so. It may be observed, that nothing was more offensive to
Christ, than to endeavour to divert him from the work his farther called
him to; he had agreed to do; what he came into this world for, and his
heart was so much set upon; namely, to suffer and die in the room of his
people, in order to obtain salvation for them: never were such words
uttered by him, and such resentment shown to any, but to the devil
himself, when he tempted him to worship him.

For thou savourest not the things that be of God; meaning his sufferings
and death, which were the appointment of God, the counsel of his will,
the provision of his covenant; what he foretold in the prophecies of the
Old Testament, and what he had an hand in, and in which the glory of his
grace, power, and justice, was concerned, and were the end of the
mission of his Son into this world; which things were out of sight and
mind, and were not regarded by the apostle at this time;

but those that be of men: he thought of nothing but worldly grandeur in
the kingdom of the Messiah, as a temporal prince and Saviour; and of the
continuance of Christ's natural life, for his own carnal and worldly
advantage; which showed him to be, at this time, greatly under the
influence of corrupt nature. So, though the blood, righteousness,
sacrifice, and death of Christ, are savoury things, things to be
savoured, minded, and regarded by believers, and accounted precious; and
they do mind them, so the word signifies, [Rom
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#005.md) when being blessed with a
spiritual and experimental knowledge, and application of them to
themselves, they exercise faith, hope, and love upon Christ, with
respect unto them; when they remember them aright in the ordinance of
the supper, the love from whence they spring, and the benefits that come
hereby; and when they discern the Lord's body in it, a crucified Jesus,
and the blessings of grace which come by him, and ascribe their whole
salvation to his sufferings and death, and taste the sweetness there is
in these things, eating his flesh and drinking his blood by faith; yet
being left to themselves, they do not savour, mind, and regard these
things, but carnal things, and human schemes; as when they are dilatory
to profess a crucified Christ, and submit to those ordinances of his,
which set forth his sufferings and death; or are negligent in their
attendance on them, their place being often empty at supper time; or if
they do attend, their hearts go after other things.

[Matthew 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 16:24</span></span>

Then said Jesus unto his disciples,.... Knowing that they had all
imbibed the same notion of a temporal kingdom, and were in expectation
of worldly riches, honour, and pleasure; he took this opportunity of
preaching the doctrine of the cross to them, and of letting them know,
that they must prepare for persecutions, sufferings, and death; which
they must expect to endure, as well as he, if they would be his
disciples:

if any man will come after me: that is, be a disciple and follower of
him, it being usual for the master to go before, and the disciple to
follow after him: now let it be who it will, rich or poor, learned or
unlearned, young or old, male or female, that have any inclination and
desire, or have took up a resolution in the strength of grace, to be a
disciple of Christ,

let him deny himself: let him deny sinful self, ungodliness, and worldly
lusts; and part with them, and his former sinful companions, which were
as a part of himself: let him deny righteous self, and renounce all his
own works of righteousness, in the business of justification and
salvation; let him deny himself the pleasures and profits of this world,
when in competition with Christ; let him drop and banish all his notions
and expectations of an earthly kingdom, and worldly grandeur, and think
of nothing but reproach, persecution, and death, for the sake of his
Lord and Master: and

take up his cross; cheerfully receive, and patiently bear, every
affliction and evil, however shameful and painful it may be, which is
appointed for him, and he is called unto; which is his peculiar cross,
as every Christian has his own; to which he should quietly submit, and
carry, with an entire resignation to the will of God, in imitation of
his Lord:

and follow me; in the exercise of grace, as humility, zeal, patience,
and self-denial; and in the discharge of every duty, moral, or
evangelical; and through sufferings and death, to his kingdom and glory.
The allusion is, to Christ's bearing his own cross, and Simeon's
carrying it after him, which afterwards came to pass.

[Matthew 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 16:25</span></span>

For whosoever will save his life,.... Whoever is desirous of preserving
himself from troubles, reproaches, persecutions, and death; and takes
such a method to do it, as by forsaking Christ, denying his Gospel, and
dropping his profession of it; and by so doing, curries favour with men,
in order to procure to himself worldly emoluments, honour, peace,
pleasure, and life,

shall lose it; he will expose himself to the wrath of God, to
everlasting punishment, the destruction of soul and body in hell, which
is the second death, and will be his portion:

and whosoever will lose his life for my sake: that is, is willing to
forego all the pleasures and comforts of life, and be subject to poverty
and distress, and to lay down life itself, for the sake of Christ and
the Gospel, rather than deny him, and part with truth,

shall find it; in the other world, to great advantage; he shall enjoy an
immortal and eternal life, free from all uneasiness and affliction, and
full of endless joys and pleasures.

[Matthew 16:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mat 16:26</span></span>

For what is a man profited,.... Such persons, though they are only
seeking their own profit, will find themselves most sadly mistaken; for
of what advantage will it be to such a man,

if he shall gain the whole world; all that is precious and valuable in
it; all the power, pleasures, and riches of it; if with Alexander, he
had the government of the whole world, and with Solomon, all the
delights of it; and was possessed with the wealth of Croesus, and
Crassus,

and lose his own soul? If that should be consigned to everlasting
torment and misery, be banished the divine presence, and continually
feel the gnawings of the worm of conscience that never dies, and the
fierceness of the fire of God's wrath, that shall never be quenched, he
will have a miserable bargain of it.

Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? Or, "for the
redemption" of it, as the Ethiopic version renders it: see [Psa
49:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#008.md). If he had the whole world to
give, and would give it, it would not be a sufficient ransom for it; the
redemption of an immortal soul requires a greater price than gold and
silver, or any corruptible thing; nothing short of the blood and life of
Christ, is a proper exchange, or ransom price for it. But in the other
world there will be no redemption; the loss of a soul is irrecoverable:
a soul once lost and damned, can never be retrieved. This passage is
thought to be proverbial; what comes nearest to it, is the following
(x).

"If a scholar dies, we never find an exchange for him; there are four
things which are the ministry or service of the world, , if they are
lost, they may be changed; and they are these, gold, silver, iron, and
brass, [Job 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#001.md) but if a scholar
dies, , who will bring us his exchange? or an exchange for him: we lost
R. Simon, "who will bring us his exchange?".''

[Matthew 16:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 16:27</span></span>

For the son of man shall come in the glory of his Father,.... This is a
reason, proving the truth of what is before asserted, that men's lives
may be lost by saving them, and be found by losing them, whatever
paradoxes they may seem to be; and that the loss of a soul is
irrecoverable, and no compensation can be made for it; and points out
the time, when all this will appear: for nothing is more certain, and to
be depended upon, than that Christ, who, though he was then a mean and
contemptible man, and attended with the sinless infirmities of human
nature, wherefore he calls himself, "the son of man", should come;
either a second time to judgment at the last day, in the same glory as
his Father, as his Son, equal with him, and clothed, with power and
authority from him, and as mediator, to execute judgment: with his
angels; the Holy Ones, so the Syriac and Persic versions read, and so
some copies; who will add to the glory of his appearance; and will be
employed in gathering all nations before him, and in executing his will:
or, in his power, to take vengeance on the Jewish nation; on those that
crucified him, or did not believe in him, or deserted and apostatised
from him. And then he shall reward every man according to his works, or
work; either that particular action of putting him to death, or their
unbelief in him, or desertion of him; or any, or all of their evil
works, they had been guilty of: for though good works are not the cause
of salvation, nor for which men will be rewarded; though they may be
brought into judgment, as proofs and evidences of true faith, in the
person, blood, and righteousness of Christ, by which good men will be
acquitted and discharged; yet evil works will be the cause of
condemnation, and the rule of judgment; and the reason of adjudging to
temporal punishment here, and eternal destruction hereafter.

[Matthew 16:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 16:28</span></span>

Verily I say unto you..... This is a strong asseveration, Christ puts
his "Amen" to it; declaring it to be a certain truth, which may firmly
be believed:

there be some standing here; meaning either his disciples, or some of
the audience; for it is clear from [Mar
8:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#034.md) that the people were called unto
him with his disciples, when he said these words:

which shall not taste of death: that is, shall not die; a phrase
frequently used by the Jewish doctors: they say (y),

"All the children of the world, , "taste the taste of death".''

That is, die:

till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom; which is not to be
understood of his personal coming in his kingdom in the last day, when
he will judge quick and dead; for it cannot be thought, that any then
present should live to that time, but all tasted of death long before,
as they have done; for the story of John's being alive, and to live till
then, is fabulous, and grounded on a mistake which John himself has
rectified at the close of his Gospel: nor of the glorious
transfiguration of Christ, the account of which immediately follows;
when he was seen by Peter, James, and John, persons now present; for
that, at most, was but an emblem and a pledge of his future glory:
rather, of the appearance of his kingdom, in greater glory and power,
upon his resurrection from the dead, and his ascension to heaven; when
the Spirit was poured down in an extraordinary manner, and the Gospel
was preached all over the world; was confirmed by signs and wonders, and
made effectual to the conversion and salvation of many souls; which many
then present lived to see, and were concerned in: though it seems
chiefly to have regard to his coming, to show his regal power and
authority in the destruction of the Jews; when those his enemies that
would not he should reign over them, were ordered to be brought and
slain before him; and this the Apostle John, for one, lived to be a
witness of.
