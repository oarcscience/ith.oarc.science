INTRODUCTION TO JEREMIAH 7

In this chapter the Lord, by the prophet, calls the people of the Jews
to repentance and reformation; reproves them for their vain confidence;
and threatens them with destruction for their many sins, and
particularly idolatry. The preface to all this is in [Jer
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#001.md), the exhortation to amendment,
encouraged to by a promise that they should dwell in the land, is in
[Jer 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#003.md), but this was not to be
expected on account of the temple, and temple service; but through a
thorough reformation of manners; an exercise of justice, and avoiding
all oppression and idolatry, [Jer 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#004.md),
their vain confidence in the temple is exposed; they fancying that their
standing there, and doing the service of it, would atone for their
theft, murder, adultery, perjury, and idolatry; and that they might
commit these with impunity; wherefore they are let to know, that so
doing these they made the temple a house of thieves; and that for such
wickedness, what the Lord had done to his place in Shiloh, which they
are reminded of, he would to the temple, and to them, reject and cast
them off, [Jer 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#008.md), and seeing they
also had a dependence on the prophet's prayer, he is bid not to pray for
them, for his prayers would not he heard; and he is directed to observe
their wretched idolatry, of which an instance is given, whereby they
provoked the Lord to anger; and therefore he was determined to pour out
his fury on man and beast, and on the trees and fruit of the field, [Jer
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#016.md) and whereas they trusted in their
burnt offerings and sacrifices, these are rejected, as being what were
not originally commanded; but obedience to the moral law, and the
precepts of it, which they refused to hearken to, though they were oft
called upon to it by his servants the prophets, [Jer
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#021.md), and it is foretold that the
Prophet Jeremy would meet with the same treatment; that they would not
hearken to his words, nor answer to his call; and therefore he should
declare them a disobedient, incorrigible, and an unfaithful people, [Jer
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#027.md) hence, either he, or Jerusalem,
is called upon to cut off the hair, as a sign of mourning; for their
rejection of the Lord, occasioned by their sins, and especially their
idolatry, of which instances are given, [Jer
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#029.md) and it is threatened that the
place of their idolatry should be a place of slaughter and of burial,
till there should be no room for more; and the carcasses of the rest
should be the food of fowls and beasts; and all joy should cease from
Judah and Jerusalem, [Jer 7:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#032.md)

[Jeremiah 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 7:1</span></span>

The word that came to Jeremiah,.... The Word of prophecy, as the Targum:

from the Lord, saying; this begins a new prophecy. This verse, and the
beginning of the next, are wanting in the Septuagint version.

[Jeremiah 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 7:2</span></span>

Stand in the gate of the Lord's house,.... That is, of the temple, and
the court of it. This gate, as Kimchi says, was the eastern gate, which
was the principal gate of all; see [Jer
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#002.md),

and proclaim there this word, and say; with a loud voice, as follows:

hear ye the word of the Lord, all ye of Judah; the inhabitants of the
several parts of Judea, which came to the temple to worship; very
probably it was a feast day, as Calvin conjectures; either the passover,
or pentecost, or feast of tabernacles, when all the males in Israel
appeared in court:

that enter in at these gates to worship the Lord; there were seven gates
belonging to the court, three on the north, three on the south, and one
in the east, the chief of all, as Kimchi, Abarbinel, and Ben Melech
observe; and this agrees with the account in the Misna (k). The names of
them were these; on the south side were these three, the watergate, the
gate of the firstlings; or the gate of offering, and the gate of
kindling; on the north were these three, the gate Nitzotz, called also
the gate of the song, the gate Korban, sometimes called the gate of
women, and Beth Moked; and the gate in the east was the gate Nicanor,
and this gate was the most frequented; and therefore Jeremiah was
ordered to stand here, and deliver his message.

[Jeremiah 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 7:3</span></span>

Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel,.... The Lord of armies
above and below in general, and the God of Israel in particular;
wherefore they ought to hearken to what he was about to say, and to be
obedient to him:

amend your ways and your doings; or, "make them good" (l); which shows
that they were bad, and were not agreeable to the law and will of God,
to which they ought to have been conformed; and the way to amend them
was to act according to the rule of the divine word they were favoured
with:

and I will cause you to dwell in this place; to continue to dwell in
Jerusalem, and in Judea, the land of their nativity, and in the temple,
the house of God, and place of religious worship; but, if not, it is
suggested that they should not continue here, but be carried captive
into a strange land.

[Jeremiah 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 7:4</span></span>

Trust ye not in lying words,.... In the words of the lying prophets, as
the Targum; and to the same purpose is the Arabic version,

"do not trust in lying words, for the false prophets do not profit you
in anything;''

the things in which they trusted, and in which the false prophets taught
them to place their confidence, were their coming up to the temple at
certain times for religious exercises, and their attendance on temple
service and worship, offering of sacrifices, and the like. The
Septuagint version is, "trust not in yourselves, in lying words"; see
[Luk 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#009.md), in their external actions
of devotion, in their ritual performances, taking them for
righteousness; and adds, what is not in the Hebrew text, "for they
altogether profit you not"; in the business of justification before God,
and acceptance with him:

saying, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of
the Lord, are these; that is, the people that hypocritically worshipped
there, as the false prophets told them; and so the Syriac version, "ye
are the temple of the Lord"; though that begins the next verse, with the
last clause of this,

if ye amend your ways, &c. see [Co1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#016.md) or rather the temple of the Lord
are those gates through which they entered, [Jer
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#002.md) or those buildings which were
pointed at with the finger; or "these", is a clause by itself; and the
sense is, these are the lying words that should not be trusted in,
namely, the temple and temple services; when all manner of sin and
wickedness were committed by them, which they thought to atone for by
coming to the temple and worshipping there. The mention of these words
three times is, as Jarchi thinks, in reference to the Jews appearing in
the temple three times a year, at the feast of passover, pentecost, and
tabernacles; and so the Targum,

"who say (i.e. the false prophets), before the temple of the Lord ye
worship; before the temple of the Lord ye sacrifice; before the temple
of the Lord ye bow; three times in a year ye appear before him.''

Kimchi's father, R. Joseph, is of opinion, that it refers to the three
parts of the temple, the porch, the holy place, and the holy of holies;
but Kimchi himself takes it that these words are trebled for the greater
confirmation of them; and they may denote the vehemence and ardour of
affection for the temple.

[Jeremiah 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 7:5</span></span>

For if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings,.... Or, "if ye
make your ways good, and do your works well", which is what is exhorted
to [Jer 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#003.md), and respects the duties
of the moral law; which are more acceptable to God than legal
sacrifices, when done from right principles, and with right views, from
love, in faith, and to the glory of God; which is doing good works well;
the particulars of which follow:

if you thoroughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour;
without respect to persons, without favour and affection, without
bribery and corruption; passing a righteous sentence, and making an
equitable decision of the case between them, according to the law of
God, and the rules of justice and equity: this respects judges and civil
magistrates.

[Jeremiah 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 7:6</span></span>

If ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow,.... Who
have none to help them, and who ought to have mercy and compassion shown
them, as well as justice done them; and should not be injured by private
men in their persons and properties, and much less oppressed in courts
of judicature by those who should be the patrons and defenders of them:

and shed not innocent blood in this place: in the temple, where the
sanhedrim, or great court of judicature, sat; for this does not so much
respect the commission of murder by private persons, as the condemnation
of innocent men to death by the judges, which is all one as shedding
their blood; and by which actions they defiled that temple they cried
up, and put their trust in; to shed innocent blood in any place, Kimchi
observes, is an evil; but to shed it in this place, in the temple, was a
greater evil, because this was the place of the Shechinah, or where the
divine Majesty dwelt:

neither walk after other gods to your hurt; the gods of e people, as the
Targum; "for this", as the Arabic version renders it, "is pernicious to
you"; idolatry was more hurtful to themselves than to God; and therefore
it is dissuaded from by an argument taken from their own interest.

[Jeremiah 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 7:7</span></span>

Then will I cause you to dwell in this place,.... In the land of Judea,
and not suffer them to be carried captive, which they had been
threatened with, and had reason to expect, should they continue in their
sins, in their impenitence and vain confidence:

in the land that I gave to your fathers; to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
by promise; and to the Jewish fathers in the times of Joshua, by putting
them in actual possession of it:

for ever and ever: for a great while; a long time, as Kimchi explains
it; from the days of Abraham for ever, even all the days of the world,
provided they and their children walked in the ways of the Lord. This
clause may either be connected with the word "dwell", or with the word
give; and the sense is, either that they should dwell in it for ever and
ever; or it was given to their fathers for ever and ever.

[Jeremiah 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 7:8</span></span>

Behold, ye trust in lying words,.... What they are dissuaded from, [Jer
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#004.md), is here affirmed they did, and
which is introduced with a note of asseveration, attention, and
admiration; it being a certain thing that they did so; and was what was
worthy of their consideration and serious reflection upon; and it was
astonishing that they should, since so to do was of no advantage to
them, but the contrary:

that cannot profit; temple worship and service, legal sacrifices and
ceremonies, could not take away sin, and expiate the guilt of it; or
justify men, and render them acceptable to God; these, without faith in
the blood and sacrifice of Christ, were of no avail; and especially
could never be thought to be of any use and profit, when such gross
abominations were indulged by them as are next mentioned.

[Jeremiah 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 7:9</span></span>

Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely,.... At
the same time they offered sacrifices, and trusted in them, they did
those things, which would not be grateful to the Lord, nor profitable to
them; or, "ye do steal", &c.; so the Septuagint, and all the Oriental
versions; and likewise the Targum; as charging them with them; these are
sins against the second table of the law, as what follow are against the
first:

and burn incense to Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know not;
for they not only burnt incense to Baal, which was an act of idolatrous
worship; but served other strange gods they had not known before; whose
names they had never heard of, and of whose help and assistance they now
had no experience, nor received any benefit from, as they had on the one
and only true God; and therefore it was great folly and ingratitude in
them to forsake the Lord, and walk after these.

[Jeremiah 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 7:10</span></span>

And come and stand before me in this house,.... In the temple; this they
did after they had been guilty of such immoralities and idolatry;
thinking by their appearance there, and their performance of a few
ceremonies, and offering of some sacrifices, that all were atoned for:
or this denotes their impudence, that, after the commission of such
notorious crimes, they should have the front to come into the house of
God, and stand before him, as if they had never departed from him, and
were his people, and the true worshippers of him:

which is called by my name; the temple of God, the house of God, the
sanctuary of the Lord; and where his name was also called upon, being a
house of prayer; or where prayer was made to the Lord:

and say, we are delivered; from the punishment of the above sins, by
coming into the temple, and standing before the Lord in it; by calling
on his name, and offering sacrifices, though with impure hearts and
hands, and in a hypocritical way

to do all these abominations; before mentioned; theft, murder, adultery,
perjury, and idolatry. The sense is, either we are delivered and freed
from punishment, that we may do these things with impunity; this is the
use we make of, and the inference we draw from, our deliverance from
evil: or we are delivered, though we commit these abominations, and
therefore in them: or, seeing we are delivered, therefore do we these
things; not that they really said these words, but this was the language
of their actions. The Syriac version is, "deliver us, while we commit
all these sins".

[Jeremiah 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 7:11</span></span>

Is this house, which is called by my name,.... Meaning the temple:

become a den of robbers in your eyes? or do you look upon it, and make
use of it, as thieves do of dens; who, when they have robbed and
murdered men, betake themselves to them, not only to share their spoil,
but to hide themselves? just so those thieves, murderers adulterers,
perjurers, and idolaters, after they had committed such gross
enormities, came into the temple and offered sacrifices; thinking hereby
to cover their sins, and expiate the guilt of them, and to be looked
upon as good men, and true worshippers of God, when they were no better
than thieves and robbers; and such were the Pharisees in Christ's time,
and such was the temple as made by them; see [Mat
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#013.md),

behold, even I have seen it, saith the Lord; not only all the
abominations committed by them, but the use they made of the temple and
the worship of it; all the hypocrisy of their hearts, and the inward
thoughts of them, and their views and intentions in their offerings and
sacrifices; as well as what ruin and destruction the Lord designed to
bring shortly upon them, and upon that house which they had made a den
of robbers; as follows:

[Jeremiah 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 7:12</span></span>

But go ye now unto my place, which was in Shiloh,.... A city in the
tribe of Ephraim, on the north of Bethel, and the south of Lebonah, and
not far from Shechem, [Jdg 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#019.md) here
were the tabernacle, the ark and altar of the Lord, and the sacrifices;
and therefore the tabernacle is called the tabernacle of Shiloh, [Psa
78:60](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#060.md), and here the Lord calls it his
place; the place of the house of his Shechinah, as the Targum
paraphrases it; and where he would have those people go; which is not to
be understood locally, but of their taking this place into the
consideration of their minds, and observe what was done to it, and
became of it; though it was once the place where the Lord dwelt, and
where his name was called formerly; as follows:

where I set my name at the first; when the children of Israel first
entered into Canaan's land, the tabernacle was set up and established in
Shiloh, in Joshua's time, [Jos 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#001.md)
and there it continued to the times of Eli:

and see what I did to it, for the wickedness of my people Israel; he
refused and forsook his tabernacle there; he suffered the ark, which was
fetched from thence in the times of Eli, to be taken and carried
captive, and that because of the sins of his people, [Psa
78:60](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#060). Jerom (m.md) says, in his time,
the altar that was pulled down was shown, though scarce the foundations
of it were to be seen. Now the Lord would have these people consider
what was done to Shiloh; that though this was the first place where the
tabernacle was set in the land of Canaan, and so the inhabitants of it
had antiquity on their side; yet this did not secure them, nor the tribe
it was in, from being rejected by the Lord, when they sinned against
him; nor should the tribes of Judah and Benjamin think themselves secure
because of the temple of the Lord, since they might expect he would do
to them for their sins what he had done to others before.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 7:13</span></span>

And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the Lord,....
Meaning evil works, such as theft, murder, adultery, perjury, and
idolatry, mentioned [Jer 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#008.md) or the
same which were done by the people of Israel, on account of which the
tabernacle at Shiloh was left:

and I spake unto you, rising up early; that is, by his servants the
prophets, whom he sent unto them, and by whom he spoke, as the Targum
paraphrases it, and as it is in [Jer
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#025.md), which shows the Lord's great
concern for this people, his early care of them, in sending his servants
betimes to warn, rebuke, and reclaim them:

and speaking, but ye heard not; would not listen to the words of the
prophets, and of the Lord by them; but turned a deaf ear to them, which
aggravates their stubbornness, obstinacy, and wickedness, that so much
respect should be shown them, so much pains should be taken with them,
and that so early, and yet to no purpose:

and I called you, but ye answered not; this call was by the external
ministry of the prophets, and was with great vehemence in them, but not
with divine energy; however, it was sufficient to leave the Jews without
excuse; and their inattention to it exposes their hardness and wilful
obstinacy; see [Pro 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#024.md).

Therefore will I do unto this house, which is called by my name,.... The
temple, as in [Jer 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#011.md), for though it
was called by his name, and his name was called upon in it, yet this
could not secure it from desolation; for so the name of the Lord was set
in the tabernacle at Shiloh, and yet he forsook it through the
wickedness of the people:

wherein ye trust; they trusted in the sacrifices there offered up, and
the service there performed; in the holiness of the place, and because
it was the residence of the divine Majesty; wherefore they thought this
would be a protection and defence of them; and this was trusting in
lying words, as in [Jer 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#004.md),

and unto the place which I gave unto you and your fathers; meaning
either Jerusalem; and so the Syriac version renders it, "and to the
city"; or the whole land of Judea, as in [Jer
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#007.md),

as I have done to Shiloh; See Gill on [Jer
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#012.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 7:15</span></span>

And I will cast you out of my sight,.... Or, "from before my face", or
"faces" (n); out of the land of Judea, and cause them to go into
captivity; and so the Targum paraphrases it,

"I will cause you to remove out of the land of the house of my
majesty:''

as I have cast out all your brethren, even the whole seed of Ephraim; or
Israel, as the Targum; that is, the ten tribes so called, because
Ephraim, a principal tribe, and the metropolis of the kingdom, was in
it, and Jeroboam, the first king of the ten tribes, was of it: now, as
they were carried captive into Babylon, so should the Jews; or they of
the two tribes of Judah and Benjamin; who could not expect to fare
better than their brethren, who were more in number than they; and
especially since they were guilty of the same sins.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 7:16</span></span>

Therefore pray not thou for this people,.... These are the words of the
Lord to the Prophet Jeremiah, forbidding him to pray for the people of
the Jews; which he either was doing, or about to do, and which, from the
great affection he had for them, he was inclined unto; wherefore, to
show how much the Lord was displeased with them, and how determined he
was to punish them with captivity, he orders the prophet not to make any
supplication for them:

neither lift up cry nor prayer for them; referring to the gestures of
lifting up the eyes and hands in prayer, and also to the frame of the
heart, in the exercise of faith and holy confidence: "cry" and "prayer"
are put together, because prayer is sometimes made, especially when
persons are in great distress, with strong cryings and tears; see [Heb
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007.md),

neither make intercession to me; or, "meet me" (o); or come between him
and this people, and so act the part of a mediator, of which office
intercession is a branch; it properly belongs to Christ. The Jews say
(p) there is no "meeting", but prayer, or that is always intended by it;
for proof of which they cite this passage:

for I will not hear thee; on the behalf of them, being so highly
provoked by them, and determined they should go into captivity; see [Jer
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#001.md).

Seest thou not what they do in the cities Judah,.... Not in one city
only, but in all of and particularly the chief of them; as follows:

and in the streets of Jerusalem? these words, with what is said next,
show the reason why the prophet was forbid to pray for this people, and
the Lord was so provoked with them as to cast them out of his sight; and
he appeals to the prophet, and to what he saw, or which he might see;
for what was done was done not in secret, but openly, in the very
streets of the city; by which he might be sufficiently convinced it was
but just with God to do what he determined to do with them.

[Jeremiah 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 7:18</span></span>

The children gather wood,.... In the fields, or out of the neighbouring
forest; not little children, but young men, who were able to cut down
trees, and bear and carry burdens of wood:

and the fathers kindle the fire; take the wood of their children, lay it
in order, and put fire to it; which shows that they approved of what
their children did, and that what they did was by their direction and
order:

and the women knead their dough; so that every age and sex were employed
in idolatrous service, which is here intended; the corruption was
universal; and therefore the whole body was ripe for ruin; nor would the
Lord be entreated for them: and all this preparation was,

to make cakes for the queen of heaven; the moon, as Abarbinel; which
rules by night, as the sun is the king that rules by day; and which was
much worshipped by the Heathens, whom the Jews imitated. Some render it,

to the work, or workmanship, of heavens; (q) that is, to the whole host
of heaven, sun, moon, and stars, which were worshipped in the cities of
Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem, [Kg2
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#005.md). The Targum renders it,

"to the star of heaven;''

and Jarchi interprets it of some great star in the heaven, called the
queen of heaven; and thinks that these cakes had the impress of a star
upon them; see [Amo 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#026.md) where mention
is made of "Chiun, your image, the star of your god". The word "chiun"
is akin to the word here translated cakes, and thought to be explained
by a star; see also [Act 7:43](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#043.md) but it
seems rather to be the moon, which is expressly called by Apuleius (r)
the queen of heaven; and often by others Coelestis; and Urania by the
Africans, as Tertullian (s) and Herodian (t) affirm; as also Beltis, by
Abydenus (u); and Baaltis, by Philo-Byblius, or Sanchoniatho (w); which
have the signification of "queen"; and these cakes might have the form
of the moon upon them, and be made and offered in imitation of the
shewbread:

and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods; not different from the
queen of heaven, and the hosts thereof; for to her and them drink
offerings were poured out, [Jer 44:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#018.md)
but other gods besides the one, only, living, and true God:

that they may provoke me to anger; not that this was their intention,
but so it was eventually.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 7:19</span></span>

Do they provoke me to anger? saith the Lord,.... No: he cannot be
provoked to anger as men are; anger does not fall upon him as it does on
men; there is no such affection in God as there is in men; his Spirit
cannot be irritated and provoked in the manner that the spirits of men
may be; and though sin, and particularly idolatry, is disagreeable to
him, contrary to his nature, and repugnant to his will; yet the damage
arising from it is more to men themselves than to him; and though he
sometimes does things which are like to what are done by men when they
are angry, yet in reality there is no such perturbation in God as there
is in men:

do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces? the
greatest hurt that is done is done to themselves; they are the sufferers
in the end; they bring ruin and destruction upon themselves; and
therefore have great reason to be angry with themselves, since what they
do issues in their own shame and confusion. The Targum is,

"do they think that they provoke me? saith the Lord; is it not for evil
to themselves, that they may be confounded in their works?''

[Jeremiah 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 7:20</span></span>

Therefore thus saith the Lord God,.... Since these are their thoughts,
and this the fruit of their doings:

behold, my anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place; like
fire, to consume and destroy it; meaning Jerusalem, which was burned
with fire; as an emblem of God's wrath, and an instance of his vengeance
upon it, for sins; which came down in great abundance, like a storm or
tempest:

upon man and upon beast; upon beasts for the sake of man, they being his
property, and for his use; otherwise they are innocent, and do not
deserve the wrath of God, nor are they sensible of it:

and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of your ground;
which should be blighted by nipping winds, or cut down and trampled upon
by the Chaldean army:

and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched; that is, the wrath of God
shall burn like fire, and shall not cease until it has executed the
whole will of God in the punishment of his people.

[Jeremiah 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 7:21</span></span>

Thus saith the Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel,.... The Lord of
armies above and below, and the covenant God of the people of Israel;
who were bound to serve him, not only by the laws of creation, and the
bounties of Providence, but were under obligation so to do by the
distinguishing blessings of his goodness bestowed upon them; wherefore
their idolatry, and other sins committed against him, were the more
heinous and aggravated:

put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat flesh; that is,
add one offering to another; offer every kind of sacrifice, and, when
you have done, eat the flesh of them yourselves; for that is all the
advantage that comes by them; they are not acceptable to me, as Jarchi
observes, therefore why should you lose them? burnt offerings were
wholly consumed, and nothing was left of them to eat; but of other
sacrifices there were, particularly the peace offerings; which the
Jewish commentators think are here meant by sacrifices; and therefore
the people are bid to join them together, that they might have flesh to
eat; which was all the profit arising to them by legal sacrifices. The
words seem to be sarcastically spoken; showing the unacceptableness of
legal sacrifices to God, when sin was indulged, and the unprofitableness
of them to men.

[Jeremiah 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 7:22</span></span>

For I spake not unto your fathers,.... Meaning not Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, but Moses, Aaron, and others, who were living at the time of the
bringing of the children of Israel out of Egypt, as appears by what
follows:

nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of
Egypt, concerning burnt offerings, or sacrifices; these are not in the
decalogue or ten commands; these are no part of that law or covenant,
but are an appendage or addition to it; and though they are of early
institution and use, yet they never were appointed for the sake of
themselves, but for another end; they were types of Christ, and were
designed to lead the faith of the people of God to him; they never were
intended as proper expiations of sin, and much less to cover and
encourage immorality; whenever therefore they were offered up in a
hypocritical manner, and without faith in Christ, and in order to atone
for sinful actions, without any regard to the sacrifice of Christ, they
were an abomination to the Lord. These were not the only things the Lord
commanded the children of Israel; nor the chief and principal ones; and
in comparison of others, of more consequence and moment, were as none at
all; and which are next mentioned.

[Jeremiah 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 7:23</span></span>

But this thing commanded I them, saying,.... This was the sum and
substance of what was then commanded, even obedience to the moral law;
this was the main and principal thing enjoined, and to which the promise
was annexed:

obey my voice: the word of the Lord, his commands, the precepts of the
decalogue; obedience to which was preferable to the sacrifices of the
ceremonial law; see [Sa1 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022.md),
wherefore it follows:

and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people; the meaning is, that
while they were obedient to him, he would protect them from their
enemies, and continue them in their privileges and blessings, which he
had bestowed upon them as his peculiar people:

and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you; not only in some
of them, but in all of them; not merely in the observance of legal
sacrifices, but chiefly in the performance of moral actions; even in all
the duties of religion, in whatsoever is required in the law, respecting
God or man:

that it may be well unto you; that they might continue in the land which
was given them for an inheritance, and enjoy all the blessings promised
to their obedience.

[Jeremiah 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 7:24</span></span>

But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear,.... Neither to the law
that was given them, nor to the promises that were made unto them, this
was the case of the Jewish fathers, and also of their posterity, to whom
belonged the law, and the promises, and the service of God:

but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart;
what their evil heart imagined, advised and directed to, that they
attended to, walked in, and pursued after. The heart of man is evil; it
is desperately wicked, even wickedness itself; and so is every thought
and every imagination of the thoughts of it and all its counsels,
machinations and contrivances; and therefore the consequence of walking
in these, or steering the course of life according to them, must be bad:

and went backward, and not forward; they went backwards from the ways of
God, and walked not in them. The Targum is,

"they turned the back in my worship, and did not put my fear before
their face;''

or else this may design, not their sin, but their punishment, as Kimchi
interprets it; they did not prosper, but suffered adversity; a curse,
and not a blessing, attended the works of their hands.

[Jeremiah 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 7:25</span></span>

Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto
this day,.... That is, in all generations; ever since their first coming
out of Egypt, they had been disobedient to the commands of God, and had
walked after their own hearts' lusts, and had gone backward, and not
forward; for this is not to be connected with what follows:

I have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up
early, and sending them; which should be rendered, "although I have
sent" (x); which is an aggravation of their sin, that they should
continue in their disobedience, though the Lord sent to them to exhort
and warn them, not one, or two, of his servants the prophets, but all of
them, and that daily; who rose early in the morning, which denotes their
care and diligence to do their message; and which, because they were
sent of the Lord, and did his work as he directed them, it is attributed
to himself; and of these there was a constant succession, from the time
of their coming out of Egypt unto that day; which shows the goodness of
God to that people, and their slothfulness, hardness, and obstinacy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 7:26</span></span>

Yet they hearkened not unto me,.... Speaking by the prophets:

nor inclined their ear; to what was said to them; would not listen to
it, and much less obey what was commanded them:

but hardened their neck; and so became stiffnecked, and would not submit
to bear the yoke of the law:

they did worse than their fathers; every generation grew more and more
wicked, and went on to be so until the measure of their iniquity was
filled up; hence it follows:

[Jeremiah 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 7:27</span></span>

Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them,.... Before
mentioned in the chapter; exhortations to duty, dehortations from sin,
promises and threatenings:

but they will not hearken to thee: so as to reform from their evil ways,
and do the will of God; they will neither be allured by promises, nor
awed by menaces:

thou shalt also call unto them; with a loud voice, showing great
vehemency and earnestness, being concerned for their good, and knowing
the danger they were in:

but they will not answer thee; this the Lord knew, being God omniscient;
and therefore, when it came to pass, it would be a confirmation to the
prophet of his mission; and being told of it beforehand, was prepared to
meet with and expect such a reception from them; so that he would not be
discouraged at it; and at the same time it would confirm the character
given of this people before.

[Jeremiah 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jer 7:28</span></span>

But thou shalt say unto them,.... Having found by experience, after long
speaking and calling to them, that they are a disobedient and
incorrigible people:

this is a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the Lord their God; who,
though the Lord is their God, and has chosen and avouched them to be his
special people, whom he has distinguished by special favours; yet what
he says by his prophets they pay no regard unto, and are no better than
the Gentiles, which know not God:

nor receiveth correction; or "instruction" (y); so as to be reclaimed,
and made the better; neither by the word, nor by the rod; neither had
any effect upon them:

truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth; neither faith nor
faithfulness is in them; nothing but lying, hypocrisy, and insincerity.

Cut off thine hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away,.... This supplement
is made, because the word is feminine; and therefore cannot be directed
to the prophet, but to Jerusalem, and its inhabitants; shaving the head
is a sign of mourning, [Job 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#020.md) and
this is enjoined, to show that there would soon be a reason for it;
wherefore it follows:

and take up a lamentation on high places: that it might be heard afar
off; or because of the idolatry frequently committed in high places. The
Targum is,

"pluck off the hair for thy great ones that are carried captive, and
take up a lamentation for the princes:''

for the Lord hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath; a
generation of men, deserving of the wrath of God, and appointed to it,
on whom he determined to pour it out; of which his rejection and
forsaking of them was a token: this was remarkably true of that
generation in which Christ and his apostles lived, who disbelieved the
Messiah, and had no faith in him, and spoke lying and blasphemous words
concerning him; and therefore were rejected and forsaken by the Lord;
and wrath came upon them to the uttermost.

[Jeremiah 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 7:30</span></span>

For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith the
Lord,.... Meaning not a single action only, but a series, a course of
evil actions; and those openly, in a daring manner, not only before men,
but in the sight of God, and in contempt of him, like the men of Sodom,
[Gen 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#013.md),

they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my
name, to defile it; that is, set their idols in the temple; here
Manasseh set up a graven image of the grove, [Kg2
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#007.md) which was done, as if it was done
on purpose to defile it.

[Jeremiah 7:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jer 7:31</span></span>

And they have built the high places of Tophet,.... Where was the idol
Moloch; and which place had its name, as Jarchi thinks, from the beating
of drums, that the parents of the children that were burnt might not
hear the cry of them: which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom; a
valley near Jerusalem, and lay to the south of it, [Jos
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#008.md),

to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire: which was done, as
Jarchi says, by putting them into the arms of the brasen image Moloch,
heated hot. The account he gives of Tophet is this,

"Tophet is Moloch, which was made of brass; and they heated him from his
lower parts; and his hands being stretched out, and made hot, they put
the child between his hands, and it was burnt; when it vehemently cried
out; but the priests beat a drum, that the father might not hear the
voice of his son, and his heart might not be moved:''

but in this he is mistaken; for "Tophet" was not the name of an idol,
but of a place, as is clear from this and the following verse. There is
some agreement between this account of Jarchi, and that which Diodorus
Siculus (z) gives of Saturn, to whom children were sacrificed by the
Carthaginians; who had, he says, a brasen image of Saturn, which
stretched out his hands, inclining to the earth; so that a child put
upon them rolled down, and fell into a chasm full of fire:

which I commanded them not: not in my law, as the Targum; nor by any of
the prophets, as Jarchi paraphrases it; he commanded them, as Kimchi
observes, to burn their beasts, but not their sons and daughters. The
instance of Abraham offering up Isaac will not justify it. The case of
Jephthah's daughter, if sacrificed, was not by divine command. The
giving of seed to Moloch, and letting any pass through the fire to him,
is expressly forbidden, [Lev 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021.md),

neither came it into my heart; it was not so much as thought of by him,
still less desired, and much less commanded by him. Jarchi's note is,

"though I spoke to Abraham to slay his son, it did not enter into my
heart that he should slay him, but to make known his righteousness.''

Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord,.... And they were
coming on apace; a little longer, and they would be come; for it was but
a few years after this ere Jerusalem was besieged and taken by the army
of the Chaldeans, and the slaughter made after mentioned:

that it shall no more be called Tophet: no more be used for such
barbarous and idolatrous worship; and no more have its name from such a
shocking circumstance:

nor the valley of the son of Hinnom; as it had been from the times of
Joshua:

but the valley of slaughter: or, "of the slain"; as the Targum,
Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic versions; because of the multitude of men
that should be killed there, or brought there to be buried; as follows:

for they shall bury in Tophet till there be no place: till there be no
more room to bury there; or, "because there was no place" (a) elsewhere;
the number of the slain being so many: this was in righteous judgment,
that where they had sacrificed their children, there they should be
slain, at least buried.

And the carcasses of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the
heaven, and for the beasts of the earth,.... That is, those which remain
unburied, for which there will be found no place to bury them in; all
places, particularly Tophet, being so full of dead bodies; not to have a
burial, which is here threatened, was accounted a great judgment:

and none shall fray them away; or frighten them away; that is, drive
away the fowls and the beasts from the carcasses. The sense is, either
that there should be such a vast consumption of men, that there would be
none left to do this, and so the fowls and beasts might prey upon the
carcasses without any disturbance; or else that those that were left
would be so devoid of humanity, as not to do this office for the dead.

Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the
streets of Jerusalem,.... Signifying that the devastation should not
only be in and about Jerusalem, but should reach all over the land of
Judea; since in all cities, towns, and villages, would cease

the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness; upon any account
whatever; and, instead of that, mourning, weeping, and lamentation:

the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride; no marrying,
and giving in marriage, and so no expressions of joy on such occasions;
and consequently no likelihood, at present, of repeopling the city of
Jerusalem, and the other cities of Judah:

for the land shall be desolate; without people to dwell in it, and till
it. The Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic versions, read, "the whole land".
