INTRODUCTION TO JEREMIAH 34

In this chapter is a prophecy of the taking and burning of Jerusalem; of
the captivity of Zedekiah king of Judah; and of the destruction of the
whole land, because of their breach of covenant to let servants go free.
The time of this prophecy is observed, [Jer
34:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#001.md); the taking and burning of the
city, [Jer 34:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#002.md); the carrying captive
the king, who yet should not die a violent death, but in peace, and
should have an honourable funeral, [Jer
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#003.md); the covenant the king, princes,
and people entered into, to let their servants go free, according to the
law of God, which was at first observed, and afterwards retracted, [Jer
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#008.md); which conduct is taken notice of
and resented, [Jer 34:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#013.md); and they are
threatened with the sore judgments of God, sword, famine, pestilence,
and captivity, the king, princes, priests, and people; and with the
destruction, not on of Jerusalem, but of the rest of the cities of
Judah, [Jer 34:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#017.md).

[Jeremiah 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 34:1</span></span>

The word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord,.... This prophecy came
to Jeremiah, and was delivered by him, when he was at liberty, and
before his imprisonment, and was the occasion of it, as appears from
[Jer 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#002.md); compared with [Jer
34:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#002.md); the prophecies not standing in
the proper order in which they were given out; for the prophecy, in this
first part of the chapter at least, was delivered out before that in the
thirty second chapter:

when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the
kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought
against Jerusalem; when this mighty monarch appeared before Jerusalem
with a numerous army, consisting of Chaldeans, the natives of his own
kingdom, and with the auxiliary troops of each the kingdoms he had
subdued and made tributary to him, even people of almost every nation
under the heavens; and invested it, and laid siege to it, and lay
against it:

and against all the cities thereof; the rest of the cities of Judah,
which were as daughters of Jerusalem, the metropolis or mother city:

saying; as follows:

[Jeremiah 34:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 34:2</span></span>

Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel,.... Who, though the covenant God
of Israel, yet provoked by their sins, sends the following message to
their king:

go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him: alone; and tell it
to no other but him, at least at present; the message being more
peculiar to him, and must, had it been told to the people, been very
disheartening to them:

behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon,

and he shall burn it with fire; see [Jer
32:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#003.md); which was exactly accomplished,
[Jer 52:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#013.md).

[Jeremiah 34:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 34:3</span></span>

And thou shalt not escape out of his hand,.... Though he would, and did
attempt to do it, [Jer 52:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#008.md);

but shall surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; he was taken on
the plains of Jericho, and delivered into the hands of the king of
Babylon at Riblah; as may be seen in the place just referred to:

and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon; and that
was all; for they were quickly put out by him:

and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to
Babylon; see [Jer 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#003.md).

[Jeremiah 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 34:4</span></span>

Yet hear the word of the Lord, O Zedekiah king of Judah,.... Which,
though a king, he ought to hearken to; and, besides, what follows was
for comfort, being a mitigation of his sentence, and containing in it
mercy, as well as judgment:

thus saith the Lord of thee, thou shalt not die by the sword: of the
king of Babylon; or a violent death; and therefore fear not to deliver
up thyself and city into his hands; which he might be twelfth to do,
fearing he would put him to death immediately.

[Jeremiah 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 34:5</span></span>

But thou shall die in peace,.... Upon his bed, a natural death, and in
good friendship with the king of Babylon; and, it may be, in peace with
God; for before his death, some time in his captivity, he might be
brought to true repentance for his sins:

and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings which were before
thee: so shall they burn odours for thee. The sense is, that he should
have an honourable burial; and that sweet odours and spices should be
burned for him, as were for the kings of Judah his predecessors,
particularly Asa, [Ch2 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#014.md). Josephus
says (b), that Nebuchadnezzar buried him in a royal manner; though this
seems to refer to what the people of the Jews in Babylon would do in
honour of him, by burning for him. The Rabbins say, as Jarchi, Kimchi,
and Ben Melech observe, that they burned their beds and ministering
vessels, or household goods (c), as was usual on such occasions. The
Talmudist (d) a say, all this honour was done him for that single act of
ordering Jeremiah to be taken out of the dungeon; for this was done
honour to persons: so, when Gamaliel the elder died, Onkelos the
proselyte burned for him seventy Tyrian pounds (e); not such a quantity
of money, but goods that were worth so much; and this was a custom with
the Heathens, who used to burn the bodies of the dead, to burn their
garments with them, and their armour, and whatever were valuable and
esteemed of by them life; and particularly odoriferous things, as
frankincense, saffron, myrrh, spikenard, cassia, and cinnamon (f); and
which seem to be meant here, by comparing the passage with the case of
Asa before mentioned; for though the word "odours" is not in the text,
it seems rightly enough supplied by us, as it is by other interpreters
(g). The Vulgate Latin version very wrongly translates it, "and shall
burn thee"; for it was not the manner of the Jews to burn the bodies of
the dead, but to inter them in the earth; and so Tacitus (h) observes,
it was the custom of the Jews not to burn, but after the manner of the
Egyptians to bury in the earth nor does it appear to have been the
custom of the Babylonians or Chaldeans, as should seem from the account
that is given of the death and burial of the Babylonian monarch in [Isa
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#004.md);

and they will lament, saying, Ah lord! alas! our lord the king is dead.
The form of lamentation said over him, as the Jews record (i), was,

"alas! King Zedekiah, who is dead, drank the dregs of all ages;''

was punished for the sins of men in all generations past:

for I have pronounced the word, saith the Lord; both that which respects
his captivity, and that which refers to his death; the manner of it, and
his honourable interment, which shall be accomplished.

[Jeremiah 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 34:6</span></span>

Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words,.... The threatening, as
well as the consolatory ones; he kept back no part of the message he was
sent with, but faithfully delivered the whole:

unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem; though he knew it would
displease him, and bring himself into trouble, as it did; for upon this
he was put into prison.

[Jeremiah 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 34:7</span></span>

When the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem,.... Had laid
close siege to it, and still continued it:

and against all the cities of Judah that were left; unconquered by him;
when he invaded the land, he fought against, and took, and ravished all
the cities that lay in his way; and it seems there were none that stood
out against him but Jerusalem, now besieged by him, and two others, next
mentioned:

against Lachish, and against Azekah; for these defenced cities remained
of the cities of Judah; two cities that had been fortified by Rehoboam,
[Ch2 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#009.md); and were the only ones
besides Jerusalem, which as yet had not fallen into the hands of the
king of Babylon.

[Jeremiah 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 34:8</span></span>

This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord,.... Here begins a
new prophecy, which was delivered some time after the former; that was
given out while the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem; this after
he had quitted the siege for a while, and was gone to meet the king of
Egypt, who was coming to the relief of the city, as appears from [Jer
34:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#021); though the Jews (k.md) say this
was delivered in the seventh year of Zedekiah, in the first month, and
tenth day of the month; at the same time that the elders of Israel came
to Ezekiel, to inquire of the Lord by him, [Eze
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#001.md); which was two years before the
king of Babylon came against Jerusalem; but this seems not likely. It is
said to be

after that the King Zedekiah made a covenant with all the people that
were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them; not unto the people,
or to themselves, the king and the people; unless the sense is, that the
king and the people entered into an agreement among themselves to make
proclamation, that liberty would be granted by them to their servants;
for the liberty proclaimed was to the servants, and not to them. This
seems to confirm it, that it was while the city was besieged that this
covenant was made; since it was made only with the people at Jerusalem,
which were pent up in it; for otherwise it would in all probability have
been made with all the people of the land; and seems to have been done
with this view, to obtain this favour of the Lord, that they might gain
their freedom from the enemy, and come not under the yoke and into the
servitude of the king of Babylon: and very probable it is that they did
not do this of their own accord, but were exhorted to it by Jeremiah;
who perhaps, among other sins, had reproved them for the breach of the
law respecting the liberty of servants.

[Jeremiah 34:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 34:9</span></span>

That every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant,
being an Hebrew, or an Hebrewess, go free,.... This is the proclamation
that was agreed to be made, that every manservant and maidservant, that
serve six years an apprenticeship, should be freed from their servitude,
according to the law in [Exo 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#001.md); a
law founded upon justice and equity, mercy and compassion; done for the
honour of the Jewish nation, that they might be a free people, and in
commemoration of their deliverance from their servitude in Egypt. This
law, as it seems, had been long neglected, and servants had been
retained in bondage beyond their due time, through the oppression and
covetousness of their masters, and the neglect of the civil magistrates;
who should have took care that such a law was put in execution, and that
servants were not oppressed. Some have thought that it was at the
beginning of the sabbatical year that this proclamation was made, when,
according to the law, there should be a release of servants, [Deu
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#001.md); but that was not a release of
servants, but of debts; for if a servant had not served out his time,
the sabbatical year, or year of release, did not discharge him; though
the year of jubilee did, according to Maimonides (l), who says,

"if the year of release happens in any of the six years, he (the
servant) serves in it; but if the year of jubilee happens within the
time, even though he has been sold but one year before it, he is free;''

that none should serve himself of them, to wit, of a Jew his brother; or
cause them to serve him, oblige them against their will to continue in
his service; or by any means avail himself of them, and receive to
himself any profit or advantage by their service, they being Jews and
brethren; which seems to be added, both as the reason of the law,
because they were brethren of the same nation and religion with them,
and to distinguish them from other servants, who notwithstanding this
law might be retained as such.

\(l\) Hilchot Abadim, c. 2. sect. 2.

[Jeremiah 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 34:10</span></span>

Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered into the
covenant,.... The king had made with the people. Here the princes are
mentioned, who were not before, but included in the people; they and the
rest of the people are here meant, who having agreed to the covenant,

heard that everyone should let his manservant, and everyone his
maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves of them any
more; or any longer, which they had done, contrary to law: when they
understood that this was the sum of the covenant they had entered into,
and this the intent of the proclamation they agreed unto; or when they
heard the law read and explained by the prophet, concerning the
manumission of the Hebrew servants, when the time of their servitude was
expired,

then they obeyed, and let them go; dismissed them from their service, in
obedience to the law of God, agreeably to their own covenant, and the
proclamation of liberty they assented to. The whole might be rendered
thus, "and all the princes and all the people obeyed, which had entered
into the covenant, to let everyone his manservant, and everyone his
maidservant, go free, not to serve themselves of them any more, and they
obeyed, I say, to let them go"; so far they did well, and were
praiseworthy, that they kept the law of God, and their own covenant.

[Jeremiah 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 34:11</span></span>

But afterwards they turned,.... From the law of God, and their own
agreement, and returned to their former usage of their servants; they
changed their minds and measures. This seems to be done, when the king
of Babylon, hearing the king of Egypt was coming to break up the siege
of Jerusalem, quitted it, and went forth to meet him, as appears from
[Jer 34:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#021.md); the Jews now finding
themselves at liberty, and out of danger as they imagined, wickedly
rebelled against the law of God; perfidiously broke their own covenant,
repenting of what they had done, and returned to their former ways of
oppression and cruelty; which shows they were not hearty and sincere in
their covenant:

and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free,

to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for
handmaids; which was done by force, contrary to the will of their
servants and handmaids, and in violation of the law of God, and their
own solemn oath and covenant.

[Jeremiah 34:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 34:12</span></span>

Therefore the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah from the Lord,.... The
word of Jehovah the Son, from Jehovah the Father, because of this
transgression of the princes and people, and as soon as it was committed
by them; for it is plain, from [Jer
34:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#021.md), that it was before the Chaldean
army returned to Jerusalem, after its departure from it:

saying; as follows:

[Jeremiah 34:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 34:13</span></span>

Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel,.... The covenant God of Israel,
their Creator, Redeemer, and Benefactor:

I made a covenant with your fathers; gave them a system of laws, among
which was that of release of servants:

in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt; that is,
at that time, quickly after, when they were come to Mount Sinai; this
shows what fathers are meant, the Jewish ancestors that came out of
Egypt, brought from thence by the mighty hand of God, and indulged with
many favours by him, both in the wilderness, and in the land of Canaan,
where he brought and settled them:

out of the house of bondmen; where they were bondmen, servants, and
slaves: this is mentioned, to put them in mind of their former state and
condition; to observe unto them the foundation and ground of the law
concerning servants, how equitable and merciful it was, and to aggravate
their sin; who though their fathers had been bondmen, and they must have
been so too, had they not been released, yet acted such a cruel part to
their servants, who were their brethren, in not discharging them in due
time:

saying; giving out the following law, as a part of the covenant made
with their fathers.

[Jeremiah 34:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 34:14</span></span>

At the end of seven years,.... Not when seven years were elapsed and
fully completed; but within the compass of seven years, or as soon as
the seventh year was began; for this term of seven years is the term of
the seventh year coming in, and not going out, as appears from the law
itself, [Exo 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#009.md); and from an after
clause in this verse, "when he hath served thee six years"; at the end
of which, and the beginning of the seventh: and so Maimonides (m)
interprets this law,

"he whom the sanhedrim sold served six years from the day of his sale,
and at the beginning of the seventh year he was free:''

though the Vulgate Latin version very wrongly renders it, "when seven
years are completed"; which version Sanctius takes a good deal of pains
to reconcile to the original law. A Hebrew might sell himself for more
years than six; he might sell himself for ten or twelve, as the above
Jewish writer says, and nothing could release him but the year of
jubilee; and that would do it, if he had served but one year (n);

let ye go every man his brother, an Hebrew, which hath been sold unto
thee; or, "hath sold himself unto thee" (o); to be a servant; for money
was not given with apprentices to their masters, as is usual with us;
but masters gave money for their servants, and bought them either of
themselves, or of the magistrates; hence it is said, "if thou buy an
Hebrew servant", &c. [Exo 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#002.md). A
Hebrew servant was sold either against his will, or with it; if a man
committed a theft, and he had not wherewith to make restoration, the
sanhedrim or magistrates said him: if he was exceeding poor, the law
gave him liberty to sell himself; but he might not sell himself as long
as he had anything left, even a covering; and after that was gone, he
might sell himself; and he was bought with silver or the value of silver
or by contract or bond (p);

and when he hath served thee six years, thou shall let him go free from
thee; or "from with thee" (q); from being with thee, from being in thy
house, as well as from being in thy service; he was to be dismissed, so
as to go where he pleased, and work for himself, or another, as he
thought fit;

but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear; to
obey the laws of God, and particularly this concerning servants. This is
not to be understood of the fathers with whom the covenant was first
made, and to whom this law was first given; but their posterity in later
times, who yet lived long before the present generation, and so might
with great propriety be called their fathers; and by which it appears
that this law had been long neglected.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 34:15</span></span>

And ye were now turned,.... Or, "today indeed ye were turned" (r) some
little time ago, indeed, it must be owned, that ye turned from the evil
ways of your fathers, for which you were to be commended, as having
acted a better part than they:

and had done right in my sight; what was acceptable to the Lord,
approved of by him, being agreeably to his law; and it would have been
well if they had continued so doing:

in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; for a manservant, or
maidservant, was his neighbour, and to be treated as such, and loved as
himself, especially a Hebrew one, of the same nation and religion; and
not to be used as a slave, or retained for ever in bondage:

and ye made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my
name; this circumstance is mentioned as an aggravation of the breach of
the covenant they had made, to dismiss their servants according to law;
it was made in a very solemn manner, in the presence of God, appealing
to him as a witness; it was done in the temple, a sacred place, devoted
to him and his worship; which was called by his name, the temple of the
Lord, and where his name was called upon, and where were the symbols of
his presence.

But ye turned and polluted my name,.... Changed their minds, and turned
from their resolutions they had entered into, and the good ways they
were walking in, and returned to their former evil practices; and so
polluted the name of God by taking it in vain, and breaking the covenant
they had agreed to:

and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom he
had set at liberty at pleasure: or, "according to their soul" (s);
according to their souls' desire, what was very agreeable and acceptable
to them, and gave them a real pleasure; which did not last long, since
they caused them

to return to their former service and bondage under them:

and brought them into subjection: forced them to come back to their
houses, and into their service, and be subject to them, and obey their
commands as formerly:

to be unto you for servants and for handmaids; to do the business of
such, as they had done before.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 34:17</span></span>

Therefore thus saith the Lord,.... This being the case, and this their
crime, which was provoking to the Lord;

ye have not hearkened unto me in proclaiming liberty everyone to his
brother, and everyone to his neighbour; for though they did proclaim
liberty, they did not act according to it; they did not give the liberty
they proclaimed, at least they did not continue so to do; as soon almost
as they had granted the favour, they took it away again; and because
they did not persevere in well doing, it is reckoned by the Lord as not
done at all:

behold, I proclaim liberty for you, saith the Lord; or rather against
them; he dismissed them from his service, care, and protection, and
consigned them to other lords and masters: he gave them up

to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; to rule over them;
and gave them liberty to make havoc of them, and destroy them, that what
was left by the one might be seized on by the other:

and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth:
or, "for a commotion" (t); to be moved, and wander from place to place
in great fear and terror, not knowing where to settle or live
comfortably. This was a liberty to go about in foreign countries where
they could, for relief and shelter, being banished from their own land;
but this was a liberty very miserable and uncomfortable; and indeed no
other than captivity and bondage; and so it is threatened that what
remained of them, who were not destroyed with the sword of the
Chaldeans, or perished not by pestilence and famine, should be carried
captive, and be miserable vagabonds in each of the kingdoms and nations
of the world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 34:18</span></span>

And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant,.... The
covenant the king, princes, and all the people made, to let their
servants go free, is called the Lord's covenant, because made in his
name, in his presence, and before him as a witness; and very probably
the calf that was cut in pieces on this occasion, after mentioned, was
sacrificed to him, which made him a party concerned; unless this is to
be understood of the covenant of God in general made with Israel on
Mount Sinai; and so is distinct from the other covenant, which may be
more especially designed in the next clause:

which have not performed the words of the covenant made before me; did
not perform what they promised to do in the presence of the Lord, as in
[Jer 34:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#015.md);

when they cut the calf in twain, and passed between the parts thereof;
which was a rite or custom used in making and confirming covenants; a
calf, or some other creature, were cut in pieces, and the parts laid in
order, and the covenantees passed between these parts; signifying
thereby, that if they did not fulfil the engagements they entered into,
they imprecated to be cut to pieces as that creature was. Some footsteps
of this practice are to be seen as early as the times of Abraham, [Gen
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#009.md); upon which place Jarchi
observes, that it was the way of making a covenant to divide a beast,
and pass between the parts of it; and this custom obtained among the
Chaldeans, Greeks, and Romans; or what was very similar to it. Cyril (u)
says this custom was by the Chaldeans, who might take it from Abraham. A
people called Molotti had something of this kind among them: for they
confirmed the covenants they swore to by cutting oxen into little pieces
(w); and Homer seems to have a respect to such a practice when he says
that the priest, after he had prayed to Apollo, slew the sacrifice, and
flayed it, and cut it in pieces, making duplicates (x), alike to one
another. Cicero (y) is thought to have the same custom in view; and
likewise Virgil (z), when he speaks of the covenant made between Romulus
and Tatius king of the Sabines, whom he represents as standing armed
before the altar of Jupiter, holding caps, and joining in covenant by
killing a swine, and cutting it in pieces; in like manner Livy (a)
describes the covenant made between the Romans and Albanians, when the
herald at arms, reciting the conditions, called aloud

""hear, O Jupiter", &c.''

if the Roman people first fail in observing these,

"strike them as I now strike this hog; and so much the more, as thou art
more able and mighty;''

which being said, he struck it with a flint stone; hence the phrase,
"ferire foedus", to strike or make a covenant; and, in allusion to the
above custom, making a covenant is commonly called, in the Old
Testament, "cutting a covenant". Some versions, as the Syriac
interpreter, render it, "I will make the men as the calf they cut in
twain", &c. they shall be cut in pieces as that is; see [Mat
24:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#051.md).

The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem,.... Here is a
particular enumeration of the persons that had made the covenant, and
transgressed it, and that should suffer for so doing; the princes of
Judah, distinguished from the princes of Jerusalem, design such princes
as lived without Jerusalem, in the cities of Judah, and presided over
them, though now at Jerusalem, having fled thither, upon the invasion of
the king of Babylon, for their safety; as the princes of Jerusalem, or
the magistrates of that city, are distinguished from the princes of the
blood, and from the courtiers, both in this and [Jer
34:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#021.md);

the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land; that is,
as many as had got into Jerusalem to secure themselves from the common
enemy: the "priests" also were concerned herein, who had menservants,
and maidservants, as well as others; and, besides, were persons
doubtless concerned in drawing up the covenant and the form of an oath,
as well as in slaying the sacrifice, and cutting it into pieces, and
laying the parts in order: it is more surprising that there should be
"eunuchs" here; that such should be in the court of the king of Judah,
and have offices in it, and preside in them, as among the Gentiles. The
Targum renders the word "princes":

which passed between the parts of the calf; signifying their assent to
the covenant, and wishing they might be so used if they broke it.

I will even give them into the hand of their enemies,.... The Chaldeans,
who were the enemies of the Jews, that were come from a far country to
invade, dispossess, ravage, and plunder them; and what can be a greater
punishment than to be given up into an enemy's hand, to be in his power,
and at his mercy?

and into the hand of them that seek their life; not their wealth and
substance only, but their lives also; nothing less will content them:

and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven,

and to the beasts of the earth; not only such should be the cruelty of
their enemies that sought their lives, that they should slay them with
the sword, and give them no quarter; but such their inhumanity, that
they should not suffer their carcasses to be buried, but leave them
exposed to birds and beasts of prey; of the princes of Judah, see [Jer
52:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#010.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 34:21</span></span>

And Zedekiah king of Judah, and his princes,.... These were either the
princes of the blood, the sons of Zedekiah, and his nobles and
courtiers, as distinct from the princes in [Jer
34:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#019.md); these shall not be spared,
neither the king, nor his sons, nor those of the privy council: but
those

will I give I to the hands of their enemies, and into the hand of them
that seek their life; as in [Jer
34:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#020.md);

and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army; or, "even into the
hand" (b) &c. and so this is an explanation of the former, and shows who
their enemies were, and those that sought their life. The accomplishment
of this may be seen in [Jer 52:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#009.md);

which are gone up from you; departed from Jerusalem, as the Chaldean
army did upon hearing that Pharaoh king of Egypt was marching with his
army to raise the siege of Jerusalem; upon which they left it, and went
forth to meet him; and this encouraged the wicked Jews to break their
covenant, and reduce their servants to bondage again, they had let go
free; see [Jer 37:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#005.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 34:22</span></span>

Behold, I will command, saith the Lord, and cause them to return to this
city,.... The Lord of hosts, or armies, was "Generalissimo" of
Nebuchadnezzar's army, had it at his command, and could direct if as he
pleased, and order it to march and countermarch as he thought fit: it
was under the direction of his providence that it departed from
Jerusalem, to try the inhabitants of it; and now, by a secret instinct,
he would so powerfully work upon it, and by the ordering of external
causes so manage it, that it should return to Jerusalem again, and carry
on the siege with redoubled rigour:

and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire;
they fought against it by shooting arrows from their bows, casting
stones from their engines, and by beating down the walls with their
battering rams; with which making breaches, they entered in and took the
city; and burnt the temple, palaces, and other houses, with fire; of all
which see the accomplishment in [Jer
52:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#004.md);

and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without an inhabitant:
many of them were already; the king of Babylon having taken, ravaged,
and plundered them before he came to Jerusalem; and whither the
inhabitants of them, that escaped the sword, fled for security; and
others of them, that were not, now should be made desolate upon the
taking of Jerusalem, as Lachish and Azekah, [Jer
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#007.md); which should fall into the hands
of the enemy, and the inhabitants thereof be forced to flee into other
countries, or would be carried captive; so that they would be without
any, or have but few to dwell in them.
