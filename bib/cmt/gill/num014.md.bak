INTRODUCTION TO NUMBERS 14

This chapter treats or the murmurings of the children of Israel upon the
evil report of the spies, which greatly distressed Moses and Aaron, [Num
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#001.md); and of the endeavours of Joshua
and Caleb to quiet the minds of the people with a good account of the
land, and of the easy conquest of it, but to no purpose, [Num
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#006.md); and of the Lord's threatening to
destroy the people with the pestilence, [Num
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#011.md); and of the intercession of
Moses for them, which so far succeeded as to prevent their immediate
destruction, [Num 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#013.md); nevertheless
they are assured again and again, in the strongest terms, that none of
them but Joshua and Caleb should enter into the land, but their
carcasses should fall in the wilderness, even all the murmurers of
twenty years old and upwards, [Num
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#021.md); and the ten men that brought
the evil report of the good land died of a plague immediately, but the
other two lived, [Num 14:36](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#036.md); and the
body of the people that attempted to go up the mountain and enter the
land were smitten and discomfited by their enemies, after they had with
concern heard what the Lord threatened them with, [Num
14:39](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#039.md).

[Numbers 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 14:1</span></span>

And all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried,.... This is
not to be understood of every individual in the congregation of Israel,
but of the princes, heads, and elders of the people that were with Moses
and Aaron when the report of the spies was made; though indeed the
report might quickly spread throughout the body of the people, and
occasion a general outcry, which was very loud and clamorous, and
attended with all the signs of distress imaginable, in shrieks and tears
and lamentations:

and the people wept that night: perhaps throughout the night; could get
no sleep nor rest all the night, but spent it in weeping and crying, at
the thought of their condition and circumstances, and the
disappointments they had met with, as they conceived, of entering into
and possessing the land.

[Numbers 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 14:2</span></span>

And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses, and against
Aaron,.... They being the instruments of bringing them out of Egypt, and
conducting them hither:

and the whole congregation said unto them; some of them, the rest
assenting to it by their cries and tears and gestures:

would God we had died in the land of Egypt; and then what they left
behind they thought might have come into the hands of their children or
relations; but now they concluded it would become a prey to the
Canaanites:

or would God we had died in this wilderness; the wilderness of Paran, at
Taberah, where many of them had been destroyed by fire, [Num
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#001.md), and now they wish they had
perished with them.

[Numbers 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 14:3</span></span>

Wherefore hath the Lord brought us unto this land,.... Unto the borders
of it: their murmuring did not cease at Moses and Aaron, the
instruments, but proceeded against God himself, who had done such
wonderful things for them, not only in bringing them out of Egypt, but
since they had been in the wilderness; and yet so ungrateful to complain
of him and argue with him about favours bestowed on them, as if they
were injuries done to them; and particularly as if God had no other
intention in bringing them out of Egypt to the place where they were,
but

to fall by the sword: the sword of the Canaanites, as the Targum of
Jonathan adds:

that our wives and our children shall be a prey? to the same people;
they supposed they should be killed, their wives abused, and their
children made slaves of:

were it not better for us to return into Egypt? and so escape the hands
of the inhabitants of Canaan, of whom they had terrible apprehensions
from the report made of them.

[Numbers 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 14:4</span></span>

And they said one to another, let us make a captain,.... An head over
them instead of Moses, who they knew would never take the government and
care of them, should they resolve to return to Egypt as they proposed,
and besides were now so disaffected to him, that they might not care he
should. Captains they had over their several tribes, but they chose to
have one chief commander and general over them all; Nehemiah says they
did appoint one; which they either actually did, or this proposal was
interpreted as if really put in execution, they being so desirous of it,
and bent upon it; wherefore their will is taken for the deed, and so
understood; see [Neh 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#017.md),

and let us return into Egypt: which was downright madness, as some
interpreters have justly observed; they must not only expect to be
deserted by Moses, through whose means so many miracles had been wrought
for them, and who was so wise and faithful a governor of them; and by
Aaron their priest, who offered their sacrifices, and prayed for them,
and blessed them; and by such a valiant general as Joshua, who had
fought for them against their enemies; but by the Lord himself, so that
they could not expect the manna to be continued as food for them, nor
the pillar of cloud and fire as a guide unto them, nor to be protected
from their enemies, on the borders of whose countries they must pass; so
that their destruction in the wilderness seemed inevitable; and if they
could have surmounted these and other difficulties, what manner of
reception could they expect to find in Egypt, on whose account all the
firstborn of man and beast among them were slain, whom they had spoiled
of their riches, and whose king and his army, and in it perhaps the,
flower of the nation, were drowned in the Red sea, for their sakes? What
therefore could they think of, if they had any sober thought at all, but
utter ruin, should they return there again?

[Numbers 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 14:5</span></span>

Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces,.... Through shame and
confusion of face for them, at hearing so shocking a proposal made, and
such wretched ingratitude expressed; they blushed at it, and were in the
utmost distress on account of it, and therefore threw themselves into
this posture; or it may be this was done either to beg of them that they
would lay aside all thoughts of this kind, or to supplicate the divine
Majesty that he would convince them of their sin and folly, and give
them repentance for it and forgiveness of it; and this they did

before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel;
to affect them the more with a sense of their sin and danger.

[Numbers 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 14:6</span></span>

And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,.... Rose up
and interposed in this affair, looking upon themselves under a special
obligation so to do, as they were capable of confronting the other
spies, and contradicting what they had said:

which were of them that searched the land; they were two of that number,
and were the more concerned to hear such a false account given, and
distressed to observe the mutiny of the people, and therefore judged
themselves in duty bound to do all they could to stop it:

rent their clothes; in token of sorrow for the sins of the people; and
at their blasphemy and ingratitude against God, and in dread of his
wrath and fury breaking forth upon them.

[Numbers 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 14:7</span></span>

And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel,.... To as
many as could hear them, to the heads of them:

saying, the land which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding
good land; they observe that they were of the number of the spies that
were appointed and sent to search the land of Canaan, and they had
searched it, and therefore could give an account of it from their own
knowledge; and they had not only entered into it, or just looked at a
part of it, but they had gone through it, and taken a general survey of
it; and they could not but in truth and justice say of it, that it was a
good land, delightful, healthful, and fruitful; yea, "very, very good"
(q), exceeding, exceeding good, superlatively good, good beyond
expression; they were not able with words to set forth the goodness of
it; this they reported, in opposition to the ill report the other spies
had given of it.

[Numbers 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 14:8</span></span>

If the Lord delight in us,.... Continue to delight in them as he had,
and as appears by what he had done for, them in Egypt, at the Red sea,
and in the wilderness; see [Deu 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#015.md),

then he will bring us into this land, and give it us, as he has
promised:

a land which floweth with milk and honey; as the Lord himself hath
described it, and as the unbelieving spies themselves had owned it; [Num
13:27](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#027.md).

[Numbers 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 14:9</span></span>

Only rebel not ye against the Lord,.... Nothing, it is suggested, could
hinder them from the, possession of it but their rebellion against the
Lord; which might provoke him to cut them off by his immediate hand, or
to deliver them into the hands of their enemies; for rebellion is a
dreadful sin, and highly provoking, [Sa1
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#023.md),

neither fear ye the people the land; on account of their number,
strength, the walled cities they dwell in; they had nothing to fear from
them, so be it they feared the Lord, and were not disobedient to him:

for they are bread for us; as easy to be cut to pieces, and to be
devoured, consumed, and destroyed as thoroughly, as bread is when eaten;
and their fields, vineyards, all they have without and within, even all
their substance, will be a prey to us, and furnish out sufficient
provision for us, on which we may pleasantly and plentifully live, as on
bread: see [Psa 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#004.md),

their defence is departed from them; they had no heart nor spirit left
in them; no courage to defend themselves, and therefore the strength of
their bodies and their walled towns would be of no avail unto them; see
[Jos 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#009); or "their shadow" (r.md), which
covered and protected them, the providence of God which was over them,
and continued them in the land, and quiet possession of it, until the
measure of their iniquity was filled up, and the time come for his
people Israel to inhabit it; but now it was departed:

and the Lord is with us; as was evident by the cloud upon the
tabernacle, and by the manna being spread around their camp every
morning: the Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan are,"the Word of the Lord
is for our help:"

fear them not; the Canaanites, notwithstanding the strength of their
bodies, or of their cities, the Lord is mightier than they.

[Numbers 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 14:10</span></span>

But all the congregation bade stone them with stones,.... Namely, Joshua
and Caleb, who had made such a faithful report of the good land, and had
delivered such an animating and encouraging speech to the people. This
is not to be understood of the body of the people, and of all the
individuals thereof, for who then should they bid to stone Joshua and
Caleb? unless the sense is, that they stirred up and animated one
another to it; but rather it means the princes and heads of the
congregation, who commanded the common people to rise up and stone them;
for notwithstanding the affecting behaviour of Moses and Aaron, and the
arguments of Joshua and Caleb, they still persisted in their mutiny and
rebellion, until the Lord himself appeared as he did:

and the glory of the Lord appeared in the tabernacle of the
congregation, before all the children of Israel; the Shechinah, or
divine Majesty, which dwelt between the cherubim in the most holy place,
came into the court of the tabernacle; for neither in the holy nor in
the most holy place could the people see it, or the token of it: in [Deu
31:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#015.md) it is said, "the pillar of cloud
stood over the door of the tabernacle"; and Noldius (s) renders it here,
"and the glory of the Lord appeared above the tabernacle of the
congregation"; with which agree the Targum of Jonathan and the Vulgate
Latin and Septuagint versions; and so Jarchi says, the cloud descended
there, and from thence very probably some coruscations, or flashes of
lightning came forth, which plainly showed the Lord was there; and this
was done to terrify the people, and restrain them from their evil,
purposes; and to encourage the servants of the Lord, who hereby might
expect the divine protection.

[Numbers 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 14:11</span></span>

And the Lord said unto Moses,.... Out of the cloud upon the tabernacle:

how long will this people provoke me? which suggests that they had often
provoked him, and had done it long ago, and still continued to do so;
and he had long bore their provocations; but it was not reasonable, nor
could it be expected by Moses or any other, that he would bear them much
longer:

and how long will it be ere they believe me; unbelief was a sin they had
often and long been guilty of, and which greatly prevailed among them,
and was the root of all their murmurings, mutiny, and rebellion; and
what was highly provoking to the Lord, since they ought to have believed
him, and that he was able to make good, and would make good his promises
to them:

for all the signs which I have showed among them; the wonders and
miracles he had wrought in Egypt, at the Red sea, and in the wilderness,
and in their sight; on account of which they should have given credit to
his word, and which were strong aggravations of their unbelief; and is
the true reason why they entered not into the good land, [Heb
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#018.md).

[Numbers 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 14:12</span></span>

I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them,.... Deprive
them of inhabiting the land; so as many as died of the pestilence were
even all the spies who brought an evil report of the good land, [Num
14:37](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#037.md); with respect to the body of the
people, this is to be considered not as a peremptory decree or a
determined point; but is delivered partly by way of proposal to Moses,
to draw out from him what he would say to it; and partly by way of
threatening to the people, to bring them to a sense of their sin and
repentance for it:

and will make of thee a greater nation, and mightier than they: this
anticipates an objection that might be made, should the people of Israel
be cut off by the plague, and so disinherited of the land of Canaan,
what will become of the oath of God made to their fathers? to which the
answer is, it would be fulfilled in making the posterity of Moses as
great or a greater and more powerful nation than Israel now was, and by
introducing them into the land of Canaan, who would be of the seed of
the fathers of Israel, as Jarchi observes, as those people were; and
this was said to prove Moses, and try his affection to the people of
Israel; and give him an opportunity of showing his public and
disinterested spirit.

[Numbers 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 14:13</span></span>

And Moses said unto the Lord,.... In an abrupt manner, as the following
words show, his mind being greatly disturbed and distressed by the above
threatening:

then the Egyptians shall hear it; that the Lord had smitten the
Israelites with the pestilence; the Targum of Jonathan interprets it of
the children of the Egyptians who were suffocated in the sea:

for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them; they
were once sojourners among them, and slaves unto them, and they were
delivered from them by the mighty hand of the Lord upon the Egyptians,
destroying their firstborn; and therefore when they shall hear that the
Israelites were all destroyed at once by a pestilence in the wilderness,
it will be a pleasure to them, as follows.

[Numbers 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">num 14:14</span></span>

And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land,.... The land of
Canaan, between which and Egypt there was an intercourse, though not by
the way of the wilderness, being neighbours, and their original
ancestors brethren, as Mizraim and Canaan were; or "they will say" (t),
and that with joy, as the Targum of Jonathan adds; but what they would
say does not appear so plain; either it was that the Israelites were
killed in the wilderness, a tale they would tell with pleasure; but that
the Canaanites would hear of doubtless before them, and not need their
information, since the Israelites were upon their borders; or that the
Lord had brought them out of Egypt indeed, but could carry them no
further, could not introduce them into the land he had promised them; or
rather they would say to them what follows, for the preposition "for" is
not in the text, and may be omitted; and so the sense is, they will tell
them:

they have heard that thou Lord art among this people; in the tabernacle
that was in the midst of them, in the most holy place of it:

that thou Lord art seen face to face: as he was by Moses, who was at the
head of them:

and that thy cloud standeth over them; and sheltered and protected them
from the heat of the sun in the daytime, when it rested upon them in
their encampment:

and that thou goest before them, by daytime in a pillar of a cloud,

and in a pillar of fire by night; in their journeys; they will tell of
those favours thou hast shown Israel; and yet, after all, will observe
that thou hast destroyed them, which will not redound to thine honour
and glory.

\(t\) "et dicent", Pagninus, Montanus, Drusius, &c.

[Numbers 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">num 14:15</span></span>

Now if thou shall kill all this people, as one man,.... Suddenly, and at
once, as might be done by a pestilence; and as 185,000 were smitten at
once, and as thought by the same disease, by the Angel of the Lord in
the camp of the Assyrians, in later times, [Kg2
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035.md),

then the nations which have heard the fame of thee; the Egyptians,
Canaanites, and others, as Aben Ezra observes; who had heard the report
of the wonderful things done by him for Israel, and of the great favours
he had bestowed upon them, and so of his power, and goodness, and other
perfections displayed therein, which made him appear to be preferable to
all the gods of the Gentiles:

will speak, saying; as follows.

[Numbers 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 14:16</span></span>

Because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the land which
he sware unto them,.... That though he brought them out of Egypt, he was
not able to bring them through the wilderness into Canaan; and that
though he had wrought many signs and wonders for them, he could work no
more, his power failed him, he had exhausted all his might, and could
not perform the promise and oath he had made:

therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness; because he could not
fulfil his word, and so made short work of it, destroying them all
together, which Moses suggests would greatly reflect dishonour on him;
and in this he shows, that he was more concerned for the glory of God
than for his own.

[Numbers 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">num 14:17</span></span>

And now, I beseech thee, let the power of Lord be great,.... That is,
appear to be great; the power of God is great, not only mighty, but
almighty; it knows no bounds, nothing is impossible with him, he can do
whatever he pleases, [Psa 147:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#005.md); his
power, and the greatness of it, had been seen in bringing the children
of Israel out of Egypt, and through the Red sea, and in providing for
them, protecting and defending them in the wilderness; and the request
of Moses is, that it might appear greater and greater in bringing them
into the land of promise; or else he means an exceeding great display of
the grace and mercy of God in the forgiveness of the sins of the people;
for as the power of God is seen in his forbearance and longsuffering
with the wicked, [Rom 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#022.md); much more
in the forgiveness of the sins of men, there being more power and virtue
in grace to pardon, than there is in sin to damn; and as it is an
indication of strength in men, and of their power over themselves, when
they can rule their own spirits, keep under their passions, and restrain
their wrath, and show a forgiving temper, [Pro
16:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#032.md); so it is an instance of the
power of God to overcome his wrath and anger stirred up by the sins of
men; and, notwithstanding their provocations, freely to forgive: pardon
of sin is an act of power, as well as of grace and mercy, see [Mat
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#006.md); and this sense agrees with what
follows. The first letter in the word for "great" is larger than usual,
that it might be taken notice of; and to signify the exceeding greatness
of the power of God, Moses desired might be displayed in this case: and
the letter numerically signifies ten, and has been thought to respect
the ten times that Israel tempted the Lord, [Num
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#022.md); and to suggest, that though
they had so done, yet the grace and mercy of God should ten times exceed
the ingratitude of the people (u):

according as thou hast spoken, saying; as in [Exo
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006.md); and is as follows.

[Numbers 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">num 14:18</span></span>

The Lord is longsuffering,.... Towards all men, and especially towards
his own people:

and of great mercy, being abundant in goodness, and keeping mercy for
thousands:

forgiving iniquity and transgression, all sorts of sin:

and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the
fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation; which
may seem to make against the plea of Moses for mercy and forgiveness;
but the reason of these words being expressed seems to be, because they
go along with the others in the passage referred to, and are no
contradiction to the forgiving mercy of God in a way of justice; nor did
Moses request to have the guilty cleared from punishment altogether, but
that God would show mercy, at least to such a degree as not to cut off
the whole nation, and leave no posterity to inherit the land; which is
supposed in visiting the sin of the fathers to the third or fourth
generation.

[Numbers 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">num 14:19</span></span>

Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people,

according unto the greatness of thy mercy,.... Intimating, that though
the sin of this people was great, the mercy of God to pardon was
greater; and therefore he entreats that God would deal with them, not
according to the greatness of their sins, and the strictness of justice,
but according to the greatness of his mercy, who would, and does,
abundantly pardon:

and as thou hast forgiven this people from Egypt even until now; which
shows both that these people had been continually sinning against the
Lord, ever since they came out of Egypt, notwithstanding the great
goodness of God unto them, and that he had as constantly pardoned; and
therefore it was hoped and entreated that he would still continue to
pardon them, he being the same he ever was, and whose mercy and goodness
endure for ever: he had pardoned already sins of the like kind since
their coming out of Egypt, as their murmurings for bread in the
wilderness of Sin, [Exo 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#001.md), and for
water at Rephidim, [Exo 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#001.md), and even
a greater sin than these, idolatry, or the worship of the calf, [Exo
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#001.md).

[Numbers 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 14:20</span></span>

And the Lord said, I have pardoned, according to thy word. So as not to
kill them utterly as one man: which is an instance of his being
plenteous in mercy, and ready to forgive; and of the virtue and efficacy
of the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man, and of the great
regard the Lord has to the prayers of a good man for others. The
Jerusalem Targum is,"and the Word of the Lord said, lo, I have remitted
and forgiven according to thy word;''which must be understood of Christ,
the essential Word, and shows, according to the sense of the Targumist,
that he has a power to forgive sin, and must be a divine Person, for
none can forgive sin but God; see [Mar
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#007.md).

[Numbers 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 14:21</span></span>

But as truly as I live,.... Which is the form of an oath, as the Targum;
the Lord swears by his life, or by himself, because he could swear by no
greater:

all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord; this is not
the thing sworn unto or confirmed, but that by which the oath is made
and confirmed; and the sense is, that as sure as the earth "had been"
filled with the glory of the Lord, as it may be rendered, as it had been
with the fame of what he had done in Egypt, and at the Red sea; or as it
"should be" filled with it in later times, especially in the kingdom of
the Messiah in the latter day; see [Isa
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#003.md); so sure the men that had provoked
him should not see the land of Canaan.

[Numbers 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">num 14:22</span></span>

Because all those men which have seen my glory,.... His glorious
Majesty, or the emblem of it in the cloud, on the tabernacle, which had
often appeared to them, and the glorious things done by him; the glory
of his power, wisdom, goodness, faithfulness, and truth, displayed in
bringing them out of Egypt, through the Red sea, and thus far in the
wilderness, even to the borders of the land of Canaan; it should be
rendered, not "because", but "that", for this is the thing sworn to, or
the matter of the oath:

and my miracles which I did in Egypt; by the hand of Moses, both before
them, when he was sent to them, as a proof of his divine mission, and
before Pharaoh and all his court, [Exo
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#010.md), inflicting plagues upon him and
his people, [Exo 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#020.md),

and in the wilderness; in raining manna from heaven about their tents,
[Exo 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#014.md); sending them quails, [Exo
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#013.md); and giving them water out of
the rock, [Exo 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#006.md),

and have tempted me now these ten times; which the Jews understand
precisely and exactly of such a number, and which they reckon thus (w);
twice at the sea, [Exo 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#011.md); twice
concerning water, [Exo 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#023.md); twice
about manna, [Exo 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#002.md); twice about
quails, [Exo 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#012.md); once by the calf,
[Exo 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#001.md); and once in the wilderness
of Paran, [Num 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#001.md), which last and
tenth was the present temptation: these are reckoned a little otherwise
elsewhere (x); but perhaps it may be better, with Aben Ezra, to
interpret it of many times, a certain number being put for an uncertain,
they having frequently tempted the Lord:

and have not hearkened to my voice; neither to his word of promise, nor
to his word of command, and particularly his late order to go up and
possess the land, [Deu 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#021.md).

Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers,....
Not possess and enjoy the land of Canaan, which the Lord by an oath had
promised their fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give it to their
seed; and now he swears that these men, who had so often tempted him,
and been disobedient to him, should not inherit it; so the Targums of
Jonathan and Jerusalem take it for an oath; see [Heb
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#011.md),

neither shall any of them that provoked me see it; that provoked him by
the ill report they had brought of the land, by their unbelief, by their
murmurings, and mutiny.

But my servant Caleb,.... Who was one of the spies, and brought a good
and true report of the land; and so in that, as well as in other things,
approved himself to be a faithful servant of the Lord, and who had
stilled the people at the beginning of their murmur, and with Joshua had
attempted to quiet them afterwards; and though Joshua is not here
mentioned, because, as some say, he had no children, and therefore it
could not be said of him that his seed should possess the land, as is
said of Caleb; or rather, because he was to be the general and commander
of the people, who was to introduce them into the land of Canaan, and
therefore there was no necessity of expressing him by name, yet he is
afterwards mentioned, [Num 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#030.md),

because he had another spirit with him; different from that of the rest
of the spies, excepting Joshua; a spirit of faith, and of the fear of
the Lord, of might and courage, of truth and faithfulness; believing in
the promise of God, which the spies distrusted, being persuaded the land
might easily be conquered, which they feared; and bringing a true report
of the land, the reverse of the ill and false one they brought. For this
is to be understood not of the Holy Spirit of God, nor of his work upon
the hearts of good men, which is different from the spirit of the world,
though Caleb was possessed of that also:

and hath followed me fully; with full purpose of heart whithersoever he
led him, or directed him, in every path of duty, and in the exercise of
every grace; or "hath fulfilled after me" (y); obeyed his word of
command, fulfilled his mind and will, by going after him, and acting
according to the rules and directions he gave him:

him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; the land of Canaan he
went into to spy and search:

and his seed shall possess it; not the whole land, but Hebron, and the
parts about it, where he particularly went, and which he and his
posterity afterwards enjoyed, see [Num
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#022.md). The Targum of Onkelos is,
"shall expel it"; the inhabitants of it; for the word signifies both to
inherit and disinherit; and so Jarchi interprets it, shall disinherit
the Anakim, and the people that are in it, that is, drive them out of
it, as Caleb did, [Jos 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#013.md).

And now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley,.... By
the Canaanites are meant the Amorites, as Aben Ezra, which were a
principal people of the land of Canaan, and which may be confirmed by
[Deu 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#019.md); this may seem contrary to
what is said [Num 13:29](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#029.md); where they
are said to dwell in the mountain; but it may be reconciled by
observing, that indeed their proper settled habitation was in the
mountain; but now they went down from thence, and "sat" (z) in the
valley, as it may be rendered, in ambush, there lying in wait for the
children of Israel, as in [Psa 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#008.md);
and so Aben Ezra interprets it of their sitting there, to lie in wait
for them: and now, though these people had so sadly provoked the Lord,
yet such was his goodness to them, as to warn them of the design of
their enemies, and of the danger by them, to provide for their safety,
by giving them the following instruction:

tomorrow turn you; do not go forward, lest ye fall into their
ambushment, but turn about, and go the contrary way; return in the way,
or towards the parts from whence ye came: this they are bid to do
tomorrow, but did not till some time after; for, contrary to the command
of God, they went up the mount, where they were defeated by the
Amalekites and Canaanites, after which they stayed in Kadesh some days,
[Deu 1:44](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#044.md),

and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea; or in the way
towards it; and so they would be in the way to Egypt, where the people
were desirous of returning again; but as they were always a rebellious
and disobedient people, and acted contrary to God, so in this case; for
when he bid them go back towards the Red sea again, then they were for
going forward, and entering into the land of Canaan, [Num
14:40](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#040.md); though when he bid them go up,
and possess it, then they were for returning to Egypt, [Num

should not enter into and possess the land of Canaan, and the same he
repeats to him and Aaron together:

How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against
me?.... Bear with their murmurings, spare them, and not cut them off?
how long must sparing mercy be extended to them? the Lord speaks as one
weary of forbearing, so frequent and aggravated were their murmurings.
The Jews understand this not of the whole congregation of Israel, but of
the ten spies, from whence they gather, that ten make a congregation;
and they interpret the phrase, "which murmur against me", transitively,
"which cause to murmur against me"; made the children of Israel murmur
against him, so Jarchi; but rather all the people are meant, as appears
from [Num 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#028.md), and from the
following clause:

I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur
against me; for their murmurings were not only against Moses and Aaron,
but against the Lord himself, [Num

Your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness,.... They had wished they
had died in it, [Num 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#002.md), and the
Lord here declares they should, which is signified by the falling of
their carcasses in it, or their bodies, which when dead fall to the
ground, having no strength to support themselves:

and all that were numbered of you: but a few months before this time,
when their number was 603,550, [Num
1:46](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#046.md),

according to your number from twenty years old and upward; which is
observed, as Jarchi thinks, to except the Levites, for they were not
numbered with the other tribes; and when they were numbered by
themselves, their number was taken from a month old and upwards;
wherefore it need not be wondered at, if we find that there were of them
who did not fall in the wilderness, but entered into the land of Canaan,
as it is certain Eleazar the priest, the son of Aaron, did, [Num
34:17](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#017.md),

which have murmured against me; which shows, that not the spies only,
who caused the people to murmur, but the people themselves who murmured,
and had been numbered, from twenty years old and upward, are the evil
congregation the Lord thus threatened with death.

Doubtless ye shall not come into the land,.... The land of Canaan; or
"if ye shall come" (a); that is, I swear ye shall not, so the Targum of
Jonathan:

concerning which I sware to make you dwell therein; not them personally,
but the people and nation of which they were, and to which they
belonged, the seed and posterity of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to whom
the oath was made:

save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun; who brought
a good report of the land. Caleb is mentioned first, as Aben Ezra
thinks, because he first appeased and quieted the people; but in [Num
14:38](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#038.md) Joshua stands first, so that
nothing is to be inferred from hence; these were the only two of the
spies that went into the land of Canaan, [Num
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#004.md); and the only two of the
Israelites that were numbered, from twenty years old and upwards, [Num

being in that account, must be remembered to be excepted also.

made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for the unbelief of this congregation
did not make the faith, or faithfulness of God, of none effect:

good land it is by experience, and shall possess and enjoy it with
approbation, delight, and pleasure, which they, believing the spies,

used to distinguish them from their children:

they shall fall in this wilderness: which is repeated for the

pasture for their sheep; it being the custom of a shepherd, as Aben Ezra
observes, not to stand or rest in a place; and so like sheep grazing in
a wilderness, where they have short commons, and wander about in search,
of better. These forty years are to be reckoned from their coming out of
Egypt, from whence they had now been come about a year and a half:

and bear your whoredoms; the punishment of their idolatries, which are
frequently signified by this phrase, and particularly of the idolatry of
the calf, which God threatened to punish whenever he visited for sin,
[Exo 32:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#034.md); and of other sins, as
their murmurings, &c. for it was on account of them their children
wandered so long in the wilderness, and were kept out of the possession
of the land of Canaan:

until your carcasses be wasted in the wilderness; everyone of them be
consumed by death, save those before excepted, [Num

After the number of days in which ye searched the land,

even forty days,.... For so long they were searching it, [Num
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#025.md),

each day for a year; reckoning each day for a year, forty days for forty
years, as in [Eze 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#006.md),

shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years: which number is given,
being a round one, otherwise it was but thirty eight years and a half
ere they were all cut off, and their children entered the land:

and ye shall know my breach of promise; God never makes any breach of
promise; his covenant he will not break, nor alter what is gone out of
his lips; men break their promises, and transgress the covenant they
have made with him, but he never breaks his, [Psa
89:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#034.md); this should rather be rendered
only, "ye shall know my breach"; experience a breach made upon them by
him, upon their persons and families by consuming them in the
wilderness: the Targum of Jonathan is,"and ye shall know what ye have
murmured against me;''this same word is used in the plural in [Job
33:10](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#010.md), and is by the Targum rendered
"murmurings" or "complaints"; and so the sense is, ye shall know by sad
experience the evil of complaining and murmuring against me. The Vulgate
Latin version is,"ye shall know my vengeance;''and so the Septuagint,"ye
shall know the fury of my anger''which give the sense, though not a
literal version of the words.

and Aaron the high priest; and this is interpreted gathering,
conspiring, and rebelling against the Lord himself, on account of which
they might be truly called an evil congregation, and therefore it was a
determined point with him to destroy them:

in this wilderness they shall be consumed; by wasting diseases:

and there they shall die; as they wished they might, [Num

so often repeated, [Exo 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#003.md); and
which the Jews interpret not only of a corporeal death, but of an
eternal one; for they say (c)"the generation of the wilderness (of those
that died there) have no part in the world to come, nor shall stand in
judgment, as it is said, "in this wilderness", &c. [Num

by bringing up a slander upon the land; that it ate up its inhabitants,
and that the inhabitants of it were of such a stature, and so gigantic
and strong, and dwelt in such walled cities, [Num
13:28](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#028.md), that there was no probability

presence, being in the tabernacle of the congregation, [Num

relate the manner of their death; some say worms came out of their
navels, and up to their jaws, and ate them and their tongues; and others
that they came out of their tongues, and entered their navels, which
they take to be a just retaliation for sinning with their tongues: and

lived still; were not stricken with death, when the other spies were;

on the borders of which they now were:

and the people mourned greatly; because of their unhappy case, that they
should be cut off by death in the wilderness, and be deprived of the
enjoyment of the good land; their sorrow seems to have been not a godly
sorrow, or true repentance for sin committed, but a worldly sorrow that
works death; it was not on account of the evil of sin, the pardon of
which they did not seem to seek after, but on account of the evil that
was likely to come to them by it.

And they rose up early in the morning,.... The next morning after they
had heard the bad news of their consumption in the wilderness; not being
able, perhaps, to sleep that night with the thoughts of it, and being
now in a great haste to go up and possess the land of Canaan, as they
were before to return to Egypt:

and gat them up into the top of the mountain; which was the way the
spies went into the land of Canaan, [Num

ascend, as appears from [Num 14:44](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#044.md);
but they determined upon it, and got themselves ready for it:

saying, lo, we be here; this they said either to one another, animating
each other to engage in the enterprise; or to Moses and Joshua,
signifying that they were ready to go up and possess the land, if they
would put themselves at the head of them, and take the command and
direction of them:

and will go up unto the place which the Lord hath promised: the land of
Canaan:

for we have sinned; in not going up to possess it, when they were bid to
go, and in listening to the spies that brought an ill report of it, and
by murmuring against Moses and Aaron, and the Lord himself, and
proposing to make them a captain and return to Egypt, [Num

expect success, for victory is of the Lord; the Targum of Jonathan
adds,"the ark, and the tabernacle, and the cloud of glory move
not,''which were a plain indication that the Lord would not go with
them, and therefore could not hope to prevail over their enemies and
enter the land, but on the contrary might expect to be defeated by them,
as follows:

that ye be not smitten before your enemies; of which they would be in

found it proper, and draw them into a combat in the valley:

But they presumed to go up unto the hill top,.... In a bold, audacious,
and presumptuous manner; they attempted to go up to the top of the hill,
notwithstanding the remonstrances of Moses against it, and the danger
they would be exposed unto; but withdrawing themselves from God and his
ministers, and lifted up in themselves, and confident of their own
strength, ventured on this rash enterprise: the Vulgate Latin version
is, "being darkened they went up": either having their understandings
darkened, and being given up to a judicial blindness and hardness of
heart; or else they went up in the morning while it was dark, before
daylight; which latter sense is favoured by the Targum of Jonathan,"and
they girded (or armed) themselves in the dark, before the morning
light;''and the former by an ancient exposition, called Tanchuma,
mentioned by Jarchi,"they went obscure (as it were in the dark) because
without leave:"

nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and Moses, departed
not out of the camp; the cloud not being taken up, but abiding on the
tabernacle, which was the signal for resting, both for the ark, and for
the camp, the Kohathites did not move with the ark: the Jews (e) have a
notion, that there were two arks which went with Israel in the
wilderness, one in which the law was put, and another in which the
broken pieces of the tables were left; that in which the law was, was
placed in the tabernacle of the congregation, and of this it is written,
"the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and Moses, departed not", &c. but
that in which the broken pieces of the tables were, went in and out with
them: but this does not clearly appear; and it is highly probable no ark
went with them at this time; nor did Moses, the leader and commander of
the people, stir from the camp of the Levites; wherefore it was a bold
and hazardous undertaking the other camps engaged in without God going
with them, and their general before them, or Joshua his minister; for if
one did not go, the same may be concluded of the other.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">num 14:45</span></span>

Then the Amalekites came down,.... The hill; met the Israelites as they
ascended: and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill; the same with the
Amorites, one of the seven nations of Canaan, [Num
13:29](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#029.md),

and smote them; with the sword, having the advantage of them in coming
down the hill upon them:

and discomfited them even unto Hormah; the name of a place, so called
from what happened there; as Jarchi says; either from this destruction
of the Israelites at this time by these their enemies, or from the
destruction of the Canaanites by Israel, [Num
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#004.md); and so here has its name by
anticipation; or it may be from both these events, and seems to be
confirmed by a third of the like kind, having been in former times
called Zephath, [Jdg 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#017.md); see [Jos
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#030.md); though some take it to be an
appellative here, and not the proper name of a place, and render it even
unto destruction, as the Targum of Jonathan, denoting the very great
destruction and havoc that were made among them: how many were destroyed
is not certain; the judgment threatened them of God soon began to take
place, that their carcasses should fall in that wilderness.
