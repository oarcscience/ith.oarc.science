### [Psalms Chapter 99](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 99:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO PSALM 99

This psalm, with the foregoing from [Psa
90:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#001.md) is ascribed to Moses by Jarchi
and others; but cannot be his, since mention is made of Samuel in it,
who lived many years after him. The Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Syriac,
Arabic, and Ethiopic versions, more rightly attribute it to David; the
inscription of the Syriac version, after saying it is David's, subjoins,

"concerning the destruction of the Midianites, whom Moses and the people
of Israel led captive;''

of which there is not the least mention in it; but it more truly adds,

"and a prophecy concerning the glory of the kingdom of the Messiah;''

as it undoubtedly is.

[Psalms 99:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 99:1</span></span>

The Lord reigneth,.... The King Messiah, he is made and declared Lord
and Christ; he has reigned, does reign, and ever will; see [Psa
93:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#001.md),

let the people tremble: with awe of his majesty, and reverence of his
word and ordinances; rejoicing before him with trembling, as his own
people and subjects do, [Psa 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#011.md), and
so it agrees with [Psa 97:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#001.md), or it may
be understood of the people that are enemies to Christ, who would not
have him to reign, though he shall whether they will or not; and who
will sooner or later tremble for fear of him, and his righteous
judgment. Jarchi refers this to the war of Gog and Magog. The
Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, and Arabic versions, render it, "let the
people be angry"; or it may be rendered, "they are angry"; or "therefore
they are angry"; because he reigns; so the people, both Jews and
Gentiles, were angry and raged, when his kingdom was first visibly set
up among them, [Psa 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md), and so the
nations will when he takes to himself his great power, and reigns, [Rev
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#018.md),

he sitteth between the cherubim; "upon" or "above", as the Septuagint,
Vulgate Latin, and all the Oriental versions; alluding to the seat of
the Shechinah, or divine Majesty, in the holy of holies; and respects
either the exalted glory of Christ among the angels, and above them at
the right hand of God, where they are subject to him, stand about him,
ready to do his will; or rather his presence with his ministers of the
word, who are the instruments of spreading his Gospel, and enlarging his
kingdom and interest in the world; See Gill on [Psa
80:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#001.md).

let the earth be moved: not that itself out of its place, but the
inhabitants of it; and these either with a sense of sin and duty, and
become subject to Christ their King; or with wrath and indignation at
him, or through fear of him, as before; Kimchi says, at the fall of Gog
and Magog; it may be particularly understood of the land of Judea, and
of the commotion in it, especially in Jerusalem, when the tidings were
brought of the birth of the King Messiah, [Mat
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#001.md), or of the shaking and moving both
of the civil and ecclesiastical state of the nation, and of the ruin of
it; see [Heb 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#026.md).

[Psalms 99:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 99:2</span></span>

The Lord is great in Zion,.... Where the temple stood, and into which
Christ came as the proprietor of it, and gave it a greater glory by his
presence than the first temple had; here he preached his doctrines,
wrought many of his miracles; here he poured forth the Spirit on his
apostles; and from hence went forth his Gospel into all the world: or in
Zion, that is, in his church, and among his people; here he grants his
gracious presence, and bestows the blessings of his goodness; and shows
himself to be great and glorious in his person, offices, and operations;
see [Psa 98:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#001.md),

and he is high above all people; as God, he is the Creator of them all;
in whom they live, move, and have their being, and so must be above them
all; as Mediator, he is the Saviour of his own people, and exalted to be
so unto them; as King, he is higher than the kings of the earth, and
therefore must be above all the rest of the inhabitants of it; he is
higher than the heavens, and the angels there, and therefore he must be
higher than the earth, and they that dwell in it; he is highly exalted
above every name that is named in this world, or in that to come.

[Psalms 99:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 99:3</span></span>

Let them praise thy great and terrible name,.... All people, especially
the Lord's people; those that dwell in Zion, where his name is great, in
high esteem, venerable, and valued; as his name Jesus, or Saviour, is
amiable and lovely to his saints; and his name, the Lion of the tribe of
Judah, is terrible to his enemies:

for it is holy; his name is holy, as well as reverend and great; his
nature is holy, both divine and human; holy in all his ways and works;
and is holiness to his people, and therefore worthy of praise; holiness
is the ground and foundation of his praise from the seraphim, [Isa
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#003.md).

[Psalms 99:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 99:4</span></span>

The King's strength also loveth judgment,.... Or he who is a strong and
mighty King, as Christ is; which appears by saving his people, and
preserving them to his kingdom and glory, and by destroying all his and
their enemies; but, though he is so potent and victorious a Prince, yet
no tyrannical one, he loves and does what is just and righteous; he
loved the righteous law of God, and obeyed it in the whole course of his
life; he wrought out a perfect righteousness for his people, and
encourages and loves righteousness in them; he will judge the world in
righteousness hereafter; and is now on his throne, and in his kingdom,
ordering it with judgment and justice; all the administrations of his
kingly office are just and true, and herein he delights:

thou dost establish equity, or "equities" (a); uprightnesses,
righteousnesses; a perfect and a complete righteousness:

this he has prepared (b), as the word signifies, by his obedience,
sufferings, and death, and has established as an everlasting one;
moreover, equity, righteousness, and justice, are the settled rules and
laws of his government; see [Isa 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007.md),

thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob; among the true
Israel and people of God, as David his type did, [Sa2
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#015.md), thereby keeping them in due
order, in the observance of his righteous judgments and statutes, and
defending them from their enemies.

[Psalms 99:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 99:5</span></span>

Exalt ye the Lord our God,.... Christ, who is Lord of all, and Immanuel,
God with us, God in our nature, our Lord and our God; exalt him in his
person, as God over all, blessed for ever; in his offices of Prophet,
Priest, and King, by hearkening to his word, by trusting in his blood,
righteousness, and sacrifice, and by submitting to his ordinances, and
obeying his commands; exalt him in heart, thought, and affection,
thinking highly of him, and affectionately loving him; exalt and extol
him in words, speak of his love and loveliness, and of the great things
he has done; exalt him in private and in public, in the family and in
the house of God; make mention of him everywhere, that his name be
exalted:

and worship at his footstool; worship him who is the object of the
adoration of angels, and ought to be of men; worship him privately and
publicly, internally and externally, in spirit and in truth; at his
footstool, on earth, he being on his throne in heaven; see [Isa
65:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#001.md) or else the ark is meant, which
is so called, [Ch1 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#002.md), and this
being a type of the human nature of Christ, that may be meant here; and
which, though not the object of worship, nor is it said, worship his
footstool, but at it; yet, in worshipping Christ, respect is to be had
unto him, as in our nature, in which he has done such great things for
us: the Targum is,

"worship in or at the house of his sanctuary;''

so Kimchi interprets it of the sanctuary, which agrees with [Psa
99:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#009.md),

for he is holy: essentially holy, glorious in holiness as a divine
Person, and therefore to be worshipped: or "it is holy"; the footstool,
the ark, the human nature of Christ, in which the Godhead dwells bodily.

[Psalms 99:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 99:6</span></span>

Moses and Aaron among his priests,.... The priests of the Lord, called
and appointed by him, that ministered to him in that office, were the
priests of Christ, types of him, and ceased when he came: these were the
chief among them, or of them, as Kimchi observes: Moses officiated as a
priest before Aaron was called and separated to that service; yea, it
was he that consecrated and installed him in it, and that by offering
sacrifice among other things, [Exo
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#001.md), [Num
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#001.md), and that Aaron was the chief of
them there can be no question, seeing he was the first from whom a race
of priests sprung, and who gave name to that order of priesthood which
continued until the Messiah's coming:

and Samuel among them that call upon his name; these, according to
Kimchi, describe the prophets, among whom Samuel was the chief; see [Act
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#024.md) calling on the name of the Lord
includes the whole worship of God, and is often used particularly of
prayer; the object of which is God, and him only; and who is to be
called upon at all times, and especially in a time of trouble, and
always in faith, and with sincerity and truth; and an honour it is to be
among such persons: now these three men, who were eminent for religion
and piety, and particularly prayer, see [Jer
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#001.md) are mentioned to animate and
encourage the saints, by their example, to the worship and service of
the Lord, before exhorted to: they called upon the Lord; the Lord
Christ, who is the object of invocation, was so in the Old Testament
dispensation, and should be so in the New; see [Act
7:59](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#059.md). Moses called upon him, [Exo
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#011.md); so did Aaron, [Num
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#022.md), and also Samuel, [Sa1
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#008.md),

and he answered them; as he does all his people, sooner or later, in one
way or another; which is no small encouragement to pray unto him.

[Psalms 99:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 99:7</span></span>

He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar,.... In the pillar of the clouds
of glory, as the Targum; in which the Lord went before the children of
Israel in the wilderness, to lead them, and protect them from heat in
the day, [Exo 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021.md), that is, he spake
in this to Moses and Aaron; for it ceased when they came to the land of
Canaan; instances of which see in [Exo
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#009.md), some have thought that the Lord
might speak to Samuel also out of a cloud, when he called upon him, and
it thundered, since clouds and thunder go together, [Sa1
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#018.md), the cloudy pillar was a type of
Christ; and it is by him the Lord has spoken all his mind and will, when
he was clothed with a cloud, or became obscure in the form of a servant;
and it is through him, the Mediator, that men have access to God, and
answers of prayer from him:

they kept his testimonies; the law, and the precepts of it, which were
testifications of the mind and will of God; these Moses, Aaron, and
Samuel, kept, though not perfectly, yet sincerely, from a principle of
love, and with a view to the glory of God:

and the ordinance that he gave them; the ordinance of the passover, with
the several rituals of the ceremonial law, which was an ordinance of God
until the Messiah came; and we, under the Gospel dispensation, ought to
keep the ordinances of Christ in faith and love, as they have been
delivered to us; and such only can expect to be heard and answered by
the Lord; and this is the reason of the mention of these things; see
[Psa 66:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#018.md).

[Psalms 99:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 99:8</span></span>

Thou answeredst them, O Lord our God,.... This is repeated to show the
certainty of it, and to encourage the people of God, in all ages, to
pray unto him:

thou wast a God that forgavest them; even Moses, Aaron, and Samuel; for,
though they were great and good men, they did not live without sin, and
stood in need of pardoning grace and mercy, which they had; or rather
the people for whom they prayed: so the Targum,

"O God, thou wast forgiving thy people for them;''

that is, through their prayers; see [Num
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#019.md),

though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions; their sins, which are
the inventions of men, [Ecc 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#029.md).
Kimchi and others interpret this of the inventions, designs, and
practices of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, against Moses and Aaron, [Num
16:32](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#032.md) but though God took vengeance on
them, it does not appear that he forgave their iniquities; wherefore it
is best to understand this either of the sins of Moses and Aaron
themselves, which, though pardoned, God took vengeance of, and showed
his displeasure at, by not suffering them to go into the land of Canaan,
[Num 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#010.md), or else of the sins of the
Israelites, who murmured upon the report of the spies; and though they
were pardoned at the intercession of Moses, yet so far vengeance was
taken upon them, that none of them were suffered to enter the land of
Canaan; but their carcasses fell in the wilderness, [Num
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#019.md), and thus, though God forgives
the iniquities of his people, for the sake of his Son, yet he takes
vengeance of them on him, their surety; on whom they have been laid and
borne, and who has not been spared in the least; but has bore the whole
wrath and vengeance of God due to sin; and besides, though he pardons
his people, yet he chastises them for their sins, and shows his fatherly
displeasure at them.

[Psalms 99:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 99:9</span></span>

Exalt the Lord our God,.... Having given the above instances of Moses,
Aaron, and Samuel, serving and worshipping the Lord, the psalmist
repeats the exhortation in [Psa 99:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#005.md),
which he enforces by their example; See Gill on [Psa
99:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#005.md),

and worship at his holy hill; the holy hill of Zion, the church; attend
the public worship and service of it: the Targum is,

"worship at the mountain of the house of his sanctuary; the temple, a
type of the church of Christ:''

for the Lord our God is holy; his nature is holy, and he is glorious in
the perfection of his holiness, and therefore to be praised and exalted;
and his name is holy, and so reverend, and therefore to be worshipped;
see in [Psa 99:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#003.md).
