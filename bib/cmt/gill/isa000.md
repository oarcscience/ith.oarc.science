INTRODUCTION TO ISAIAH

This book is called, in the New Testament, sometimes "the Book of the
Words of the Prophet Esaias", [Luk 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#004.md)
sometimes only the "Prophet Esaias", [Act
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#028.md) and sometimes, as here, the "Book
of the Prophet Esaias", [Luk 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#017.md). In
the Syriac version the title is, "the Prophecy of Isaiah the Son of
Amos": and in the Arabic version, "the Beginning of the Prophecy of
Isaiah the Prophet". It stands first of all the prophets; though the
order of the prophets, according to the Jews (a), is, Jeremiah, Ezekiel,
Isaiah, and the twelve. But it is here placed first, not because Isaiah
prophesied before the other prophets; for Joel, Jonah, Hosea, and Amos,
begun before him, namely, in or before the days of Jeroboam the Second;
but because of the excellency of the matter contained in it. Isaiah is
called by Ben Syra (b) the great prophet, and by Eusebius (c) the
greatest of the prophets; and Jerom (d) a says, he should rather be
called an evangelist than a prophet, since he seems rather to write a
history of things past, than to prophesy of things to come; yea, he
styles him an apostle, as well as an evangelist (e): and certain it is
that no one writes so fully and clearly of the person, offices, grace,
and kingdom of Christ; of his incarnation and birth of a virgin; of his
sufferings and death, and the glory that should follow, as he does.
John, the forerunner of Christ, began his ministry with a passage out of
him concerning himself, [Mat 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#003.md). Our
Lord preached his first sermon at Nazareth out of this book, [Luk
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#017.md) and it was in this the eunuch was
reading when Philip came up to him, who from the same Scripture preached
to him Christ, [Act 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#028.md). And there
are more citations in the New Testament made out of this prophecy than
any other book, excepting the book of Psalms, as Musculus observes. To
which may be added, as another reason, the elegance and sublimity of his
style in which he exceeds the greatest of orators, Demosthenes among the
Greeks, and Tully among the Romans; and this is observed both by Jews
and Christians. Abarbinel (f) says, that the purity, and elegance of his
diction is like that of kings and counsellors, who speak more purely and
elegantly than other men: hence their Rabbins, he says, compare Isaiah
to a citizen, and Ezekiel to a countryman. And Jerom (g) observes, that
Isaiah is so eloquent and polite, that there is nothing of rusticity in
his language; and that his style is so florid, that a translation cannot
preserve it. Moreover, another reason of this book being placed first
may be the bulk of it; it being larger, and containing more chapters,
than any of the greater prophets, and almost as many as all the lesser
prophets put together. That Isaiah was the writer of this book is not to
be questioned; many of the prophecies in it are by name ascribed to him,
[Mat 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#014.md) though some others might be
the compilers of it, collect his prophecies, and digest them in order:
so the Jews say (h), that Hezekiah and his company wrote Isaiah, &c. At
what time, and in whose days he prophesied, may be learnt from [Isa
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md) by which it appears that he
prophesied long, and lived to a good old age. He began to prophesy about
A. M. 3236, and about seven hundred and seventy years before Christ.
Abulpharagius, an Arabic writer, says (i), he lived an hundred and
twenty years, eighty five of which he prophesied. It is a generally
received tradition with the Jews, that he lived to the time of Manasseh,
and that he was sawn asunder by him; and which has been embraced by the
ancient Christian writers, and is thought to be referred to in [Heb
11:37](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#037.md). See Gill on [Heb
11:37](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#037.md). But Aben Ezra on [Isa
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md) observes, that had he lived to the
time of Manasseh, it would have been written, and is of opinion that he
died in Hezekiah's time. According to the Cippi Hebraici (k), he was
buried at Tekoah, over whose grave a beautiful monument was erected;
though Epiphanius (l), or the author of the Lives of the Prophets that
go by his name, says he was buried under the oak of Rogel, near the
fountain of Siloam; and it is a tradition with the Syriac writers, that
his body lay hid in the waters of Siloah; See Gill on [Joh
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#004.md) but these are things not to be
depended on; and alike fabulous are all other writings ascribed to him,
besides this prophecy; as what are called the ascension of Isaiah, the
vision of Isaiah, and the conference of Isaiah. This book contains some
things historical, but chiefly prophetic; of which some relate to the
punishment of the Jews, and other nations; but for the most part are
evangelical, and concern the kingdom and grace of Christ; of which some
are delivered out more clearly and perspicuously, and others more
obscurely, under the type of the deliverance of the Jews from the
Babylonish captivity.
