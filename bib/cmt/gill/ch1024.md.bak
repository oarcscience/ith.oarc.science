[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

INTRODUCTION TO 1 CHRONICLES 24

This chapter relates the distribution David made of the priests into
twenty four classes or courses, and which were observed by lot, and each
course had an head or principal man over it, [Ch1
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#001.md) and of a like distribution of the
Levites into the same number of courses, to attend the priests in
theirs, [Ch1 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#020.md).

[1 Chronicles 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 24:1</span></span>

Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron,.... Into the classes
or courses following:

the sons of Aaron; Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar; [Ch1
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#003.md), these were the immediate sons of
Aaron; but the division or distribution of them into classes are of
their posterity in the times of David, who descended from the two
latter.

[1 Chronicles 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 24:2</span></span>

But Nadab and Abihu died before their father,.... While he was living,
see [Lev 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001.md).

and had no children, therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priests'
office: otherwise, as Jarchi observes, had their brethren left children,
they would have come into the office before them.

[1 Chronicles 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 24:3</span></span>

And David distributed them,.... The posterities of Eleazar and Ithamar
into certain classes or courses:

both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar;
these were the two principal men of the respective families, the one was
high priest, and the other "sagan" or deputy; or they both officiated as
high priests alternately, until the one was removed in Solomon's time,
and the other established alone. And now their brethren the priests, who
were under each of these, are the persons David divided into classes:

according to their offices in their service: to perform their office as
priests in the service of the temple in their turns.

[1 Chronicles 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 24:4</span></span>

And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the
sons of Ithamar,.... Or heads of men, heads of their fathers' houses and
families:

and thus were they divided; among the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen
chief men of the house of their fathers, and eight among the sons of
Ithamar, according to the house of their fathers; in all twenty four,
and into so many classes or courses did David divide them; Jarchi says
at first when the tabernacle was at Shiloh, there were but sixteen
courses, eight from Eleazar, and eight from Ithamar, as is explained in
the treatise of fasting (n); but when David saw that there were more
heads of men, or chief men of Eleazar's, he divided the courses of
Eleazar into two parts, and fixed sixteen courses; and the courses of
Ithamar he established as at first, eight courses; left them as they
were, which he thinks appears from [Ch1
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#006.md) but of the former number of
courses, and when and by whom fixed, the Jews are divided (o); See Gill
on [Luk 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#005.md). Perhaps there were none
before David's time.

[1 Chronicles 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 24:5</span></span>

Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another,.... Which course
should serve first, and which next, and so on; and who should be the
chief to each course; which course was to serve a week, and then go out;
and this method was taken to prevent envy, strife, and contention about
precedence:

for the governors of the sanctuary; or of the holy things, or who
presided in things ecclesiastical:

and governors of the house of God: or rather "governors of God",
appointed by him judges in civil things:

were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar: there were, of
both families, some employed both in sacred and civil things, and who
presided in each.

[1 Chronicles 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 24:6</span></span>

And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe,.... The Targum is, Moses
the chief scribe, so called: one

of the Levites wrote them: the lots, and the names upon them, put into
the urn, and as they came out, which was first, second, &c. and this was
done

before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech
the son of Abiathar, and before the chief of the fathers of the priests
and Levites; and in this public manner, before such great personages,
and in the presence of those that were interested in the affair, that it
might appear plainly no fraudulent methods were taken, and that there
might be no suspicion of any:

one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and one for Ithamar;
the sense of Jarchi as above, and other Jewish writers, is, that one was
added to each family of Eleazar, and so made sixteen, and Ithamar's were
retained, and left as at first, eight: but the sense is, that first one
family of Eleazar was taken, and then one of Ithamar's family, and then
one of Eleazar's again, and so on until sixteen were gone through; and
then the other eight were divided under so many heads of the family of
Eleazar.

[1 Chronicles 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 24:7</span></span>

Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib,.... And the other twenty
three to the following persons in order:

Jedaiah, Harim, Seorim, Malchijah, Mijamin, Hakkoz, Abijah, Jeshua,
Shecaniah, Eliashib, Jakim, Huppah, Jeshebeab, Bilgah, Immer, Hezir,
Aphses, Pethahiah, Jehezekel, Jachin, Gamul, Delaiah, and Maaziah; of
all which courses we know little more than their names, though they
continued in some form or other both under the first and second temple,
to the destruction of it; the Jews say only four of these courses
returned from the Babylonish captivity, which were those of Jedaiah,
Harim, Pashur, and Immer; though Pashur is not among these here; yet
they say each of these four had six lots, and that the names and the
order of the other courses were retained and continued under them, and
supplied by them: hence we read of Mattithiah, from whom sprung the
Maccabees, as of the course of Jehoiarib,"In those days arose Mattathias
the son of John, the son of Simeon, a priest of the sons of Joarib, from
Jerusalem, and dwelt in Modin.'' (1 Maccabees 2:1)which was the first
course, and the most honourable; wherefore Josephus (p), who was of it,
valued himself upon it, that he was not only of the priestly order, but
of the first class or course of the twenty four; and we also read of the
course of Abijah, the eighth course, of which was Zechariah the father
of John the Baptist, [Luk 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#005.md) of these
courses; see Gill on [Luk 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#005.md).

[1 Chronicles 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch1 24:19</span></span>

These were the orderings of them,.... Their classes or courses into
which they were divided:

in their service to come into the house of the Lord; to perform their
service in the temple, according to their turns, and in course as fixed
by lot; one class or course served one week, and then went out, and
another came in, each consisting of 1000 men, see [Ch1
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#004.md).

according to their manner; law, right, custom, here prescribed for them:
under Aaron their father; that is, him who was high priest for the time
being; who bore this name because his successor and representative,
under whose inspection, direction, and authority, all the rest of the
priests were, and whom they were to obey in all things:

as the Lord God of Israel had commanded him; to take care they should be
done.

[1 Chronicles 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 24:20</span></span>

And the rest of the sons of Levi were these,.... Who were not priests,
only Levites; and from hence, to [Ch1
24:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#030.md) their names are given; of the
sons of Amram, Shubael, and his son Jehdeiah; Rehabiah the son of
Eleazar, and Isshiah the son of Rehabiah; of the Izharites, so called
from Izhar, the brother of Amram, Shelomoth, and his son Jahath; and of
the sons of Hebron, another brother of Amram, Jeriah, Amariah, Jahaziel,
and Jekameam; of the sons of Uzziel, another brother of Amram, Michah,
and his son Shamir; Isshiah the brother of Michah, and his son
Zechariah: the sons of Merari, Mahli and Mushi, his immediate sons; from
whom sprung by Jaaziah, Beno, Shoham, Zaccur and Ibri; of Mahli sprung
Eleazar, who had no sons; and Kish, whose son was Jerahmeel; the sons of
Mushi, another son of Merari, Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth; most of these
names are the same with those in [Ch1
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#016.md),

these were the sons of the Levites, after the house of their fathers;
some of the principal of them.

[1 Chronicles 24:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">ch1 24:31</span></span>

These likewise cast lots over against their brethren, the sons of
Aaron,.... These, being divided into twenty four classes also, cast
lots, which class should answer to, attend upon, and serve the first
course of the priests, and which the second, and so on. And this they
did in the same solemn and public manner as the priests had done:

in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the
chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites; as in [Ch1
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#006.md).

even the principal fathers over against their younger brethren; the
sense is, either that the one stood over against the other, to be
distributed by lot, the one as well as the other; or they were chosen by
lot, let it fall as it would, without any regard to age or dignity, to
the seniority or largeness of houses and families; but as they were
chosen, be they younger or elder, richer or poorer, their families more
or less numerous and ancient, so they took their places.
