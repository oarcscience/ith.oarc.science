### [Joshua Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#001.md)

[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jos 19:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO JOSHUA 19

In this chapter an account is given of the lots of the six remaining
tribes, and the cities in them, as of Simeon, whose cities were chiefly
within the tribe of Judah, [Jos 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#001.md);
of Zebulun, its border and cities, [Jos
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#010.md); of Issachar, its border and
cities, [Jos 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#017.md); of Asher, its
border and cities, [Jos 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#024.md); of
Naphtali, its border and cities, [Jos
19:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#032.md); of Dan, its border and titles,
[Jos 19:40](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#040.md); and lastly of a gift of
inheritance to Joshua, [Jos 19:49](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#049.md).

[Joshua 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 19:1</span></span>

And the second lot came forth to Simeon,.... That is, the second of the
seven lots, of which Benjamin's was the first; otherwise there were the
two lots of Judah and Joseph, which preceded both these:

even for the tribe of the children of Simeon, according to their
families; for though many of their cities had been given by lot to the
tribe of Judah, yet it seems as if there were others they had by a
special lot cast for them, as many as were sufficient for their
families:

and their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of
Judah; which was done partly because this was but a small tribe, and
particularly because the lot put up, which fell to the tribe of Judah,
was too large for it, more than they could occupy, too much being put to
this lot by the first measurers of the land; and partly to fulfil the
prophecy of Jacob, that the Simeonites should be scattered in Jacob, and
divided in Israel, [Gen 49:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#007.md); and
hence it is that the lots of these two tribes lying together, and being
so intermixed, that the tribe of Judah called upon that of Simeon to
join them in fighting against the Canaanites, and taking out of their
hands the cities that belonged to them, [Jdg
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#003.md).

[Joshua 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 19:2</span></span>

And they had in their inheritance Beersheba and Sheba,.... Or,
Beersheba, that is, Sheba; for so the particle "vau" is sometimes used
(z), and must be so used here; or otherwise, instead of thirteen, it
will appear that there are fourteen cities, contrary to the account of
them, [Jos 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#006.md); so Kimchi and Ben
Melech make them one city. And it may be observed, that in the
enumeration of the cities of Simeon, [Ch1
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#028.md); Sheba is left out, and only
Beersheba is mentioned; which, was a well known place in, the farthest
border of the land of Israel southward, and the reason of its name is
manifest, [Gen 21:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#031.md); See Gill on [Jos
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#028.md),

and Moladah; another of the cities of Judah, [Jos
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#026.md).

\(z\) Vid. Noldium, p. 280. No. 1200.

[Joshua 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 19:3</span></span>

And Hazarshual,.... See Gill on [Jos
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#028.md),

and Balah, and Azem; of these places see Gill on [Jos
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#029.md); for Balah is the same with
Baalah there, and with Bilhah [Ch1
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#029.md); and Azem with Ezem there.

[Joshua 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 19:4</span></span>

And Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah. These were all cities of Judah,
[Jos 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#030.md); Eltolad is the same with
Tolad, and Bethul with Bethuel, [Ch1
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#029.md), and with Chesil, [Jos
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#030.md), mentioned there along with
Hormah; See Gill on [Jos 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#030.md).

[Joshua 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 19:5</span></span>

And Ziklag,.... Another of the cities of Judah; see Gill on [Jos
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#031.md),

and Bethmarcaboth, and Hazarsusah; or Hazarsusim, as in [Ch1
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#031.md); the one signifies a chariot
house, and the other a court or stable for horses, which made Bochart
conjecture (a), that they were places where Solomon kept his chariots
and horses; but it should be observed that these were the names by which
these places went in the times of the old Canaanites; and seem to me
rather where some of their kings had their horses and chariots; or
rather where there were temples dedicated to the horses and chariots of
the sun; see [Kg2 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#011.md).

[Joshua 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 19:6</span></span>

And Bethlebaoth, and Sharuhen,.... Whether the first is the same with
Lebaoth, a city of Judah, [Jos 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#032.md);
and with the Bethleptepha of Josephus (b), and the Betholene of Pliny
(c), is not certain: in this place secret to have been an idol temple of
the Canaanites, dedicated to lions, as in Egypt there was a city called
Leontopolis, from whence was the Leontopolitan nome, the inhabitants of
which worshipped lions (d); and the Egyptians had temples dedicated to
them, as Aelianus (e) relates. Both these places are thought to be the
same with Bethbirei and Shaaraim in [Ch1
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#031.md); of the latter of which see [Jos
15:36](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#036.md). Those who take Sheba, [Jos
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#002.md), to be the same with Shema, [Jos
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#026.md), make but one city here, and
take away the last, as the Greek version does, and render the word "and
their fields", and so the number still is as follows:

thirteen cities and their villages; the sum total of those enumerated
above.

[Joshua 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 19:7</span></span>

Ain, Remmon,.... Of the two first, which were cities of Judah; see Gill
on [Jos 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#032.md),

and Ether, and Ashan; of the two last; see Gill on [Jos
19:42](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#042.md),

four cities and their villages; Ain, Remmon, therefore, could not be one
city, at this time, as it seems to have been in the times of Nehemiah,
[Neh 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#029.md); or otherwise there would
have been but three cities.

[Joshua 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jos 19:8</span></span>

And all the villages that were round about these cities,.... Not only
the suburbs adjoining to those cities which are mentioned before, but
the several small distinct towns and villages, scattered up and down in
the country:

to Baalathbeer, Ramath of the south: this is the same with Baal in [Ch1
4:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#033.md); and with Ramath of the south, or
south Ramoth, as it is called [Sa1
30:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#027.md); all these are the names of one
and the same city:

this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon,

according to their families; that is, the above named cities fell to the
lot of the inheritance of the Simeonites, and were divided among them
according to the number of their respective families; at least, these
were the chief and principal of them; for all that they possessed are
not mentioned, particularly one called Tochen, [Ch1
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#032.md); and another, the name of which
is Etam there, unless that is thought to be the same with Ether here in
[Jos 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#007). Josephus says (f.md), this
tribe took by lot that part of Idumea which lay near to Egypt and
Arabia.

\(f\) Antiqu. l. 5. c. 1. sect. 22.

[Joshua 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 19:9</span></span>

Out of the portion of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the
children of Simeon,.... Which is the reason why no description is given
of the border of their inheritance, because that is before given in the
account of the lot of Judah:

for the part of the children of Judah was too much for them: they had
more cities than they could fill with people, and more land than they
could cultivate; they had an hundred fourteen cities with their
villages:

therefore the children of Simeon had their inheritance within the
inheritance of them; the one being a small tribe, and the other large,
and for the reasons given; See Gill on [Jos
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#001.md).

[Joshua 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 19:10</span></span>

And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun,

according to their families,.... Who, though younger than Issachar, has
his lot before him, agreeably to the order in which his blessing is
predicted, both by Jacob and Moses, [Gen
49:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#013.md);

and the border of their inheritance was unto Sarid; or "by Sarid", as
Masius, who takes this to be the southwest border of Zebulun, being near
Carmel; in which he seems to be right.

[Joshua 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jos 19:11</span></span>

And their border went up toward the sea,.... Westward towards the
Mediterranean sea, which fulfilled the prophecies of Jacob and Moses,
that Zebulun should dwell by the sea, be an haven of ships, and take of
the abundance of the seas, as in the places before referred to; and so
Josephus says, the Zebulunites took the land unto the lake of
Gennesaret, by or about Carmel and the sea:

and Maralah; which Jerom calls (g) the ascent of Zebulun; for from hence
it went up from the sea, and reached to Dabbasheth; which Jerom calls
Dasbath; the word signifies a hump that is on a camel's back, [Isa
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#006.md); so called because when that is
hurt by burdens it is cured with honey (h); it seems to denote some
place or city at a point of land or promontory, that stood out towards
the sea, as that of Carmel; or some city on the back of Carmel,
resembling a camel's hump:

and reached to the river that is before Jokneam; of Jokneam; see Gill on
[Jos 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#022.md); and this river was either
the river Kishon, or Belus, sometimes called Pagida; from whence sand
was taken to make glass of (k), and was near Carmel, as Jokneam was.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jos 19:12</span></span>

And turned from Sarid eastward,.... This describes the southern border,
going on from west to east:

towards the sunrising, unto the border of Chislothtabor; this Jerom
places in the tribe of Issachar, it bordered on both tribes; and he says
(l), that in his time there was a little village called Chaselus, eight
miles from Diocaesarea, at the foot of Mount Tabor in the plains:

and then goeth out to Daberath; which also was a city in the tribe of
Issachar, given to the Levites, [Jos
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#028). Jerom (m.md) speaks of a little
village of the Jews by Mount Tabor, of the country belonging to
Diocaesarea, called Dabira; this place is still in being. Mr. Maundrell
says (n), at the bottom of Tabor westward stands Debarah, supposed by
some to take its name from Deborah, the famous judge and deliverer of
Israel:

and goeth up to Japhia; this Jerom (o) says is the town called Sycamine,
as you go from Caesarea to Ptolemais, above the sea, because of Mount
Carmel, called Epha, thought by some to be the Jebba of Pliny (p). It
seems, however, to be the Japha of Josephus (q), which he speaks of as
being a strong fortified place both by nature and art.

[Joshua 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jos 19:13</span></span>

And from thence passeth on along on the east to Gittahhepher,.... Which
was the native place of Jonah the prophet, [Kg2
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025); and where Jerom says (r.md) his
grave was shown, and was a small village in his time two miles from
Sippore, then called Diocaesarea:

to Ittahkazin; of this place we have no account elsewhere, but it was
not far from the former:

and goeth out to Remmonmethoar to Neah; where the eastern border ended.
Some versions make Remmonmethoar distinct places; but where either of
them were exactly is not known: some, as the Targum, Jarchi, and Kimchi,
render the word "Methoar which goes about"; that is, the border went
about from Remmon to Neah, which by Jerom is called Anna, and who
observes (s), that there is another village called Anna, ten miles from
Neapolis, as you go to Aelia; and by whom also Methoar is reckoned a
distinct place, and called Amathar.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 19:14</span></span>

And the border compasseth it from the north side to Hannathon,.... This
is the northern border of the tribe, which took a circuit from the last
place to this; of which and the following place we have no account;
Jerom only makes mention of them as in the tribe of Zebulun:

and the outgoings thereof are in the valley of Jiphthahel; here the
northern border ended, which, Masius conjectures, was part of the valley
of Carmel.

[Joshua 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jos 19:15</span></span>

And Kattath, and Nahallal,.... Of the two first of these we read nowhere
else, but in [Jos 21:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#034.md),

and Shimron was a royal city, the king of which Joshua took and hanged,
[Jos 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#001.md),

and Idalah is a place Bochart conjectures (t) where the goddess Venus
was worshipped, Idalia being one of her names:

and Bethlehem is a different place from that which was the birthplace of
our Lord, called Bethlehem of Judah, to distinguish it from this:

twelve cities with their villages; more are named, but some of them
belonged to other tribes, and only lay on the borders of this; and
others might not be properly cities, but small towns.

[Joshua 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jos 19:16</span></span>

This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun, according to their
families,.... Which was allotted to it and divided, according to the
number of its families:

these cities with their villages; before enumerated, excepting such as
only bordered on them; though indeed there were other cities which
belonged to them, or might be after given them, not here mentioned, as
Kartah and Dimnah, [Jos 21:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#034.md).

[Joshua 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jos 19:17</span></span>

And the fourth lot came out to Issachar,.... The fourth of the seven
drawn at Shiloh:

for the children of Issachar, according to their families: among whom
the inheritance that came to them by the lot was divided, according to
the number of them.

[Joshua 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jos 19:18</span></span>

And their border was towards Jezreel,.... Which was a royal seat in the
time of Ahab, [Kg1 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#001.md); and according
to Jerom was near to Maximianopolis; See Gill on [Hos
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#005); and the same writer (u.md) says in
his day a large village of this name was shown in the great plain
between Scythopolis and Legion (he means the plain of Jezreel), and it
was the border of Issachar:

and Chesulloth was different from the Chislothtabor, [Jos
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#012.md); that, as Masius observes, was
to the north, this to the south of Mount Tabor:

and Shunem is a place well known for being the dwelling place of a
certain woman in the times of Elisha, whose son the prophet raised from
the dead, [Kg2 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#008.md); Jerom calls it
Sonam, where was the Shunammite woman; but this city here seems to be
what he calls Salem, in the tribe of Issachar; and he adds, that there
was shown in his day a village by this name, five miles from Mount Tabor
to the south (w): according to Bunting (x), it was forty eight miles
from Jerusalem to the north, not far from Nain.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jos 19:19</span></span>

And Hapharaim,.... The first of these is by Jerom (y) called Aphraim, a
city of the tribe of Issachar; and adds, there is at this day a village
called Affarea, six miles from Legion to the north:

and Shion; of Seon or Soen, the same with Shion here, he says (z), there
was a village of this name shown in his time near Mount Tabor:

and Anaharath, of which we have no account elsewhere.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jos 19:20</span></span>

And Rabbith,.... The first of these Jerom calls (a) Rabboth in the tribe
of Issachar:

and Kishion, as Masius notes, seems to given name to the river Kishon
near it; some take it to be the same with Kedesh, [Ch1
6:72](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#072.md),

and Abez, of which no mention is made elsewhere.

[Joshua 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jos 19:21</span></span>

And Remeth,.... Remeth seems to be the same with Jarmuth, [Jos
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#029.md); and with Ramoth, [Ch1
6:73](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#073.md),

and Engannim seems to be the same with Anem in [Ch1
6:73](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#073.md), there were several of this name,
which seem to have been places full of gardens, and well watered; for
the word signifies a fountain of gardens. Engannim is now called Jenine,
distant from Tabor twenty two miles, a place of gardens, of water, and
of pleasure, as a traveller (b) of ours tells us; who also declares (c),
that, in his whole journey from Damascus to Jerusalem, he saw not more
fruitful ground, and so much together, than he did in twenty two miles
of riding between Mount Tabor and Engannim. This seems to be the same
place Mr. Maundrell (d) calls Jeneen, a large old town on the outskirts
of Esdraelon. Dr. Lightfoot (e) is inclined to believe, that Nain, where
the widow's son was raised to life, [Luk
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#011.md), is the same with Engannim, for
which he gives various reasons:

and Enhaddah; Jerom says, in his time (f) there was a village called
Enadda, ten miles from Eleutheropolis, as you go from thence to Aelia;
but seems not to be the same with Enhaddah here:

and Bethpazzez; of Bethpazzez no mention is made elsewhere. "Beth"
signifies a "house", and "Pazzez" in the Arabic tongue signifies
"silver"; so this with the old Canaanites might be a treasure city, like
those in Egypt, [Exo 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#011.md). But where a
word begins with "Beth", as the name of a place, I always suspect there
was an idol temple there; now as the word in Hebrew signifies the same
as "Peor", opening, here might be a temple to that deity, or to one that
was similar to the god of the Moabites, and design a Priapus, among the
Canaanites like that; or as the word in the Syriac and Chaldee languages
signifies to redeem, deliver, and save, this temple might be dedicated
to some idol as their deliverer and saviour.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jos 19:22</span></span>

And the coast reacheth to Tabor,.... Tabor was the name of a mountain in
those parts; it is generally supposed to be the mountain on which our
Lord was transfigured, though it is not sufficiently evident; See Gill
on [Jer 46:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#018.md). There was a city of
this name near it, [Ch1 6:77](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#077.md), and
which is meant here, and which either gave unto or received name from
the mount. The Greeks call it Itabyrium, and it is described by Polybius
(g) as situated on a hill rising in the form of a pap or breast, and has
an ascent of more than fifteen furlongs, and he calls it a city:

and Shahazimah is not mentioned any where else:

and Bethshemesh; there seem to have been several cities, at least more
than one, of the name of Bethshemesh; one in the tribe of Judah, [Jos
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#016.md); and another in the tribe of
Naphtali, [Jos 19:38](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#038.md); which perhaps
may be the same with this, it lying on the borders of both tribes. In
this, and so in others of the same name, was a temple dedicated to the
sun by the Heathens, as there was one of the same name in Egypt for the
same reason, [Jer 43:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#013.md),

and the outgoings of their border were at Jordan; here it ended: so
Josephus says, that the border of this tribe in the length of it were
Mount Carmel (at one end), and the river (i.e. Jordan, at the other);
and at the breadth of it the mountain Itabyrium, or Mount Tabor: it had
Jordan on the east, the sea on the west, Zebulun on the north, and
Manasseh on the south:

sixteen cities with their villages; which was the sum total of them.

This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar,....
Which fell to them by lot, as before described:

according to their families; was divided among them, according to the
number of them:

the cities and their villages; the cities before enumerated, and the
villages adjacent to them.

according to their families; which was sufficient for them, and divided
to them according to their number.

And their border was Helkath,.... Helkath seems to be the same with
Hukok, [Ch1 6:75](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#075.md); and according to
Masius it lay ten or twelve miles above Ptolemais:

and Hali, of which we read nowhere else.

and Beten is by Jerom (h) called Bathne, and was in his time a village
by the name of Bethebem, eight miles from Ptolemais to the east. Reland
(i) seems to think it might be the Ecbatana of Pliny (k), which he
speaks of as near Mount Carmel, and not far from Ptolemais:

and Achshaph was a royal city, whose king was taken by Joshua; see Gill
on [Jos 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#001.md).

And Alammelech, and Amad,.... Of the two first of these there is no
mention elsewhere:

and Misheal is the same with Mashal, [Ch1
6:74](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#074); and is by Jerom (l.md) called
Masan, and said to be near Carmel to the sea:

and reacheth to Carmel westward; or, "to the sea", as Carmel is called
"Carmel by the sea"; see Gill on [Jer
46:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#018.md), it is hereby distinguished from
Carmel in the tribe of Judah, [Jos
15:55](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#055); (Pliny (m.md) calls it a
promontory):

and to Shihorlibnath; the Vulgate Latin and Septuagint versions make two
places of it: but the sum of the cities after given will not admit of
it: more rightly Junius renders it Sihor by Libhath, and takes Sihor to
be the river Belus, or Pagidus; so called either because of its likeness
to the Nile, one of whose names is Sihor, [Jer
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#018.md); or because its waters might be
black and muddy; it was the river out of which sand was fetched to make
glass of: and Libnath, which has its name from whiteness, the same
writer thinks may be the Album Promontorium, or white promontory of
Pliny (n), which he places near Ptolemais, between Ecdippa and Tyre, and
is very probable.

And turneth towards the sunrising,.... Or eastward:

to Bethdagon; there was a city of this name in the tribe of Judah; see
Gill on [Jos 15:41](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#041.md). Dagon, being a god
of the Phoenicians, had temples built for him in various places in
Canaan:

and reacheth to Zebulun; not the tribe of Zebulun, but a city so called,
the same Josephus (o) calls a strong city of Galilee, which had the name
of Men, perhaps from the populousness of it, and separated Ptolemais
from Judea:

and to the valley of Jiphthahel; see [Jos
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#014.md),

toward the north side of Bethemek; of Bethemek no mention is made
elsewhere: perhaps here was an idol temple before dedicated to the god
of the valleys; see [Kg1 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#028.md),

and Neiel; which the Greek version calls Inael, of which Jerom says (p),
it is a certain village called Betoaenea, fifteen miles from Caesarea,
situated on a mountain to the east, on which are said to be wholesome
baths:

and goeth out to Cabul on the left hand; not the land of Cabul, [Kg1
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#013); but a city, which Josephus (q.md)
calls a village on the borders of Ptolemais. The Jews (r) speak of a
city of this name, destroyed because of contentions in it.

And Hebron,.... Hebron seems to be the same with Abdon, [Jos
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#030.md); and being changed, of which
there are other instances; and hereby this is distinguished from another
Hebron in the tribe of Judah, more commonly known, [Jos
15:54](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#054.md),

and Rehob; in the time of Jerom (s), there was a village called Rooba,
four miles from Scythopolis, and which he says was a city separated to
the Levites, as this was, or one of the same name in this tribe; for
there was another, [Jos 19:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#030.md); see
[Jos 21:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#031.md); but whether either of them
is the same with this is not certain:

and Hammon; of this city we read nowhere else:

and Kanah; this Kanah is generally thought to be the same where Christ
wrought his first miracle, [Joh 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#001.md).
Jerom expressly says (u), there was a Cana in the tribe of Asher, where
our Lord and Saviour turned water into wine, [Joh
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#001.md), and from whence was Nathanael,
[Joh 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#002.md); and it is at this day, adds
he, a town in Galilee of the Gentiles. Phocas (w) places Cana between
Sippori and Nazareth, which is now shown six Roman miles from Sippori to
the west, a little inclining to the north; and there is also in the same
tract Cephar Cana, four miles from Nazareth to the north, inclining to
the east; and it is disputed which of these two is Cana of Galilee the
New Testament: with this account agrees pretty much what our countryman
Mr. Maundrell (x) gives of his travels in those parts:"taking leave of
Nazareth, (he says,) and going at first northward, we crossed the hills
that encompassed the vale of Nazareth at that side; after which we
turned to the westward, and passed in view of Cana of Galilee, the place
signalized with the beginning of Christ's miracles, [Joh

came to Sepharia;''

And then the coast turneth to Ramah,.... Which was a city in the tribe
of Naphtali, [Jos 19:36](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#036.md); and on the
borders of Asher; though Jerom (y) distinguishes them, and speaks of a
Ramah in Asher, and another in Naphtali, as different cities of the same
name; as there were several of this name, so called from their being
built on an eminence. Masius conjectures it is the same with Sarepta,
[Luk 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#026.md); famous for its wine; and
Bacchus, as the poet says, loves the hills:

and to the strong city Tyre; it is thought this is not to be understood
of the famous city, so much spoken of in other parts of Scripture, and
in profane history; since, as it is observed, that is not mentioned in
Scripture until the times of David; and though Homer makes frequent
mention of Sidon, yet never of Tyre. The words signify the strong
fortress of a rock, or a fortress on a high rock; so Kimchi and Ben
Melech; and it might be a fortified city, which being built on a rock,
might have the name of Zor or Tyre, and not be the famous city of that
name. Jerom (z) renders it the fortified city of the Assyrians:

and the coast turneth to Hosah; of which we nowhere else read:

and the outgoings thereof are at the sea; the Mediterranean sea; where
the coast ended this way:

from the coast to Achzib; this Jerom (a) says is Ecdippa, nine miles
from Ptolemais, as you go to Tyre; and this is confirmed by a learned
traveller of our own nation (b); it is now called Zib; See Gill on [Mic

and Rehob; of which; see Gill on [Jos

twenty and two cities with their villages: there are more set down in

This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher,.... As
before described, a goodly heritage; it was, according to the prediction
of Jacob and Moses, [Gen 49:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#020.md); a very
fruitful country. Josephus (c) says, the country from Carmel called the
valley, because it was such, even all over against Sidon, fell to the
Asherites, Asher had Mount Libanus on the north, Naphtali on the east,
Zebulun on the south and southeast, the sea on the west:

according to their families; the number of them, so their lot was
divided to them:

these cities with their villages; before named.

Naphtali, and directed what should be the inheritance of this tribe:

even for the children of Naphtali, according to their families; which
was to be divided among them, according to the number of their,
families.

And their coast was from Heleph,.... That is, their northern coast,
reaching from west to east, as appears by the ending of it at Jordan;
the Alexandrian copy of the Greek version calls it Mlepeh, the Targum,
Meheleph, and Jerom, Mealeb, which he calls the border of Naphtali;
which, though to the north, cannot be expressly said what and where it
was:

from Allon to Zaanannim; or rather from the oak, or from the plain in
Zaanannim (d); for it seems to be the same with the plain of Zanaaim,
[Jdg 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#011.md).

and Adami, Nekeb; some make these to be but one city, and the latter
only an epithet of the former; but the Talmudists (e) make them two, as
we do, and call the first Damin, and the latter Ziadetha; but what and
where either of them were exactly is not known; for Adami cannot be the
same with Adam, [Jos 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#016.md); as some
think; for that was in Peraea, on the other side Jordan; See Gill on
[Jos 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#016.md),

and Jabneel; Jabneel is different from that which was on the borders of
Judah, [Jos 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#011.md); and is called by
the Jews (f) since Cepherjamah:

unto Lakum; of which we nowhere else read:

and the outgoings thereof were at Jordan; here the coast ended this way.

And then the coast turneth westward to Aznothtabor,.... This was the
southern border, reaching from east to west; it began at Aznothtabor,
which Jerom (g) says was a village in his time belonging to the country
of Diocaesarea, in the plains; there is another place called
Chislothtabor, on the borders of Zebulun, [Jos
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#012.md),

and goeth out from thence to Hukkok: there the southern border ended,
which was in the border of Asher, and is the same with Helkath, [Jos
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#025.md); with which compare [Ch1
6:75](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#075.md),

and reacheth to Zebulun on the south side, and reacheth to Asher on the
west side and to Judah upon Jordan towards the sunrising; so that as it
was bounded by Lebanon, on the north, near to which some of the cities
were, mentioned in [Jos 19:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#033.md), it had
Zebulun on the south, Asher on the west, and Jordan to the east; for by
Judah is not meant the tribe of Judah, from which Naphtali was at a
great distance, but a city so called, as Fuller (h) seems rightly to
conjecture.

And the fenced cities are Ziddim,.... The later name of Ziddim,
according to the Talmud (i), was Cepharchitiya, or the village of wheat,
perhaps from the large quantity or goodness of wheat there:

Zer is called by Jerom (k) Sor, and interpreted Tyre, the metropolis of
Phoenicia, very wrongly, and, in the tribe of Naphtali:

and Hammath probably was built by the youngest son of Canaan, [Gen
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#018.md); or had its name in memory of
him; it lay to the north of the land of Israel; see [Num
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#008.md),

Rakkath, and Chinnereth; Rakkath according to the Jewish writers (l) is
the same with Tiberias, as Chinnereth with Gennesaret, from whence the
lake or sea of Tiberias, and the country and lake of Gennesaret, had
their names, often mentioned in the New Testament. Gennesaret was a most
delicious and fruitful spot, and fulfilled the prophecy of Moses, [Deu
33:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#023.md); concerning Naphtali.

notion of some, that Nekeb there is an epithet of it, and so
distinguishes it from Adamah here:

and Ramah; of Ramah, as there were several places of this name; see Gill
on [Jos 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#029.md),

and Hazor was a royal city, of which; see Gill on [Jos

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">jos 19:37</span></span>

distinguish it from others of the same name; it was one of the cities of
refuge, [Jos 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#007). Jerom says (m.md) in
his day it was called Cidissus, and was twenty miles from Tyre by
Paneas; See Gill on [Jos 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#022.md).

and Edrei is a different place from one of that name in the kingdom of
Og, [Num 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#033.md),

and Enhazor, of which we read nowhere else.

and Migdalel, which Jerom calls Magdiel, he says (m) was shown a small
village, five miles from Dara, as you go to Ptolemais:

and Horem is not mentioned anywhere elsewhere;

and Bethanath; Jerom also relates (n), that Bathana, in the tribe of
Naphtali, was a village that went by the name of Betbanes, fifteen miles
from Caesarea:

and Bethshemesh was another city, in which was a temple dedicated to the
sun, when inhabited by the Canaanites; see [Jos
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#022.md); and so in Bethanath there might
be a temple dedicated to some deity, though now uncertain what:

nineteen cities with their villages; there are more mentioned, but some
of them might be only boundaries, and so belonged to another tribe.

Damascus the city, and upper Galilee, the Naphtalites took, unto Mount
Lebanon, and the fountains of Jordan, which flow out of the mount,
reaching the northern border of the city Arce:"

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">jos 19:41</span></span>

And the coast of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol,.... The tribe
of Dan is not described by places the boundaries of it, as other tribes,
but by its cities, which were chiefly, at least several of them, taken
out of the tribe of Judah, as the two first of these most manifestly
were; See Gill on [Jos 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#033.md),

and Irshemesh signifies the city of the sun, as the Targum interprets
it, and was so called very probably from a temple in it, dedicated to
the idolatrous worship of the sun, but a different place from
Bethshemesh in other tribes; though those of that name, as this, had it
for the like reason; and so Heliopolis, in Egypt, which signifies the
same, where was a temple of the same kind; as there was another city of
this name, between the mountains of Libanus and Antilibanus, now called
Balbec (p), where the ruins of the temple are yet to be seen: but this
was a different place, the Septuagint version calls it Sammaus, and it
was, according to Jerom (q), the same with Emmaus, afterwards called
Nicopolis; which, if the same Emmaus with that in [Luk
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#013.md); though some doubt it, was sixty
furlongs from Jerusalem, or seven miles and a half.

Thamnitic country, so called from the village Thamna, which seems to be
this:

name of two places, Bane in the tribe of Dan, and Barach in the same
tribe, and which was in his day near Azotus. This place was famous in
later times among the Jews for being a place where one of their noted
Rabbins, R. Akiba, abode and taught for some time (y):

miles from Diospolis, or Lydda, as you go from Eleutheropolis to it; it
was a city given to the Levites, [Jos

with the border before Japho; Japho is the same with Joppa, now called
at this day Jaffa, a port in the Mediterranean sea, famous for being the
place where Jonah took shipping; see Gill on [Jon
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#003.md); and where the Apostle Peter
resided some time; see Gill on [Act
9:36](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#036.md); and See Gill on [Act
9:38](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#038.md). It is not certain whether Joppa
itself was in the tribe of Dan, or only on the borders of it; the coast
of Dan reached "over against" it, as it may be rendered, and included
the villages and little cities that were near it; for such there were,
as Josephus (b) testifies.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">jos 19:47</span></span>

And the coast of the children of Dan went out too little for them,....
Being a very numerous tribe, the cities allotted them were not
sufficient for them; or rather, leaving out the supplement "too little",
the words will run, it "went out from them"; they lost part of it, being
driven out of the valley into the mountain by the Amorites, [Jdg
1:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#034.md); which obliged them to seek out
elsewhere for habitations:

therefore the children of Dan went out to fight against Leshem; called
Laish, [Jdg 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#001.md), where the whole
story is related of their lighting against this place and taking it;
which, though some time after the death of Joshua, is here recorded to
give at once an account of the inheritance of Dan; and which is no
argument against Joshua's being the writer of this book, as is urged;
since it might be inserted by another hand, Ezra, or some other inspired
man, for the reason before given:

and took and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it,

and dwelt therein; being a Canaanitish city, they put all in it to the
sword, as the Lord had commanded, and took possession of it for an
habitation:

and called Leshem Dan, after the name of Dan their father; this is the
place which is always meant, where the phrase is used "from Dan to
Beersheba", [Jdg 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#001.md), this being at
the utmost northern border of the land of Canaan, as Beersheba was at
the further part of the southern coast of it. It was, according to Jerom
(c), situated near Paneas, out of which the river Jordan flowed; and
Kimchi on the text observes, their Rabbins (d) say, that Leshem is
Pamias (i.e. Paneas), and that Jordan flows from the cave of Pamias, and
had its name because it descended from Dan; and so Josephus (e) says,
that Panium is a cave under a mountain, from whence rise the springs of
Jordan, and is the fountain of it; and Pliny also says (f), the river
Jordan rises out of the fountain Paneas. This city was enlarged and
beautified by Philip Herod, and he called it by the name of Caesarea
Philippi, both in honour of Tiberius Caesar (g) and after his own name,
by which name it goes in [Mat 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#013.md);
and is called in the Jerusalem Targum on [Gen
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#014.md), Dan of Caesarea.

This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan,.... Before
described by its cities, which were in it. This tribe was bounded by
Ephraim on the north, by Judah on the east, by Simeon on the south, and
by the Mediterranean sea on the west. Josephus (h) says, the Danites
enjoyed the vale which lies to the setting sun, bounded by Azotus and
Doris, and all Jamnia and Getta, from Accaron (or Ekron) to the mountain
from whence the tribe of Judah begins:

according to their families; which inheritance was distributed according
to the number of their families:

their cities with their villages; before named.

And when they made an end of dividing the land for inheritance by their
coasts,.... That is, Eleazar, Joshua, and the ten men appointed for
this, purpose; when all the lots were drawn, and the several
inheritances which came up to them were divided among the families of
the respective tribes, this work being finished:

the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun
among them; most interpreters observe the modesty of Joshua, that though
the oldest and the greatest man in the nation, the chief governor, yet
had his inheritance last of all; nor did he take any part to himself, it
was given to him by the people, who had the whole land divided among
them; in which he was a type of Christ; see [Co2
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#009.md) [Phi
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006.md).

[Joshua 19:50](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">jos 19:50</span></span>

According to the word of the Lord,.... Or mouth of the Lord; either
according to the oracle of Urim and Thummim, which Eleazar consulted on
this occasion; or according to what the Lord had said to Moses, at the
same time that Hebron was ordered to Caleb, [Jos
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#006.md); and

they gave him the city which he asked, even Timnathserah in Mount
Ephraim; he chose a place in his own tribe, for he was of the tribe of
Ephraim; and it seems that what he chose was none of the best of places;
for Paula, as Jerom (i) relates, when she travelled into those parts,
wondered that the distributor of the possessions of the children of
Israel should choose such a rough and mountainous place for himself; of
its situation, see [Jos 24:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#030.md),

and he built the city, and dwelt therein; he rebuilt it, and fitted it
for his own habitation, and for those that belonged to him.
(Timnathserah means "an abundant portion" or "a place in the sun".
Joshua great reward was in seeing the promises of God fulfilled before
his very eyes [Jos 21:45](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#045.md) and the
children of Israel serving the Lord's during his lifetime [Jos
24:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#031.md). Joshua may have received but a
small inheritance in the promised land but this was just an earnest of
his future glorious inheritance in eternity. The saints of God have the
best portion saved for the last [Joh
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#010.md) whereas the worldling has his
best portion now; his worst is yet to come. Editor.)

These are the inheritances which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son
of Nun,.... The one the high priest, and the other the chief governor of
the nation:

and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel;
the princes appointed for this service, whose names are given [Num
34:18](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#018.md); the inheritances before
described in the preceding chapters by their boundaries and cities,
these the said persons

divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh; and so has particular
reference to the seven lots drawn there for seven of the tribes, by
which their inheritances were assigned to them: and this was done

before the Lord, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation; see
[Jos 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#001.md),

so they made an end of dividing the country; though it was not as yet
wholly subdued.
