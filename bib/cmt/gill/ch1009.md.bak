### [1 Chronicles Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 9:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO 1 CHRONICLES 9

The genealogies of the several tribes being given, according as they
were written in the books of the kings of Israel, [Ch1
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#001.md), an account follows of those who
first settled in Jerusalem after their return from the Babylonish
captivity; of the Israelites, [Ch1
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#002.md), of the priests, [Ch1
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#010.md) of the Levites, and of the charge
and offices of several of the priests and Levites, [Ch1
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#014.md), and the chapter is concluded
with a repetition of the genealogy of the ancestors and posterity of
Saul king of Israel, [Ch1 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#035.md).

[1 Chronicles 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 9:1</span></span>

So all Israel were reckoned by genealogies,.... Not now by the writer of
this book in the preceding chapters; for two of the tribes are not
reckoned at all, and the rest but in part; but there had been kept an
exact account of them:

and, behold, they were written in the book of the kings of Israel; not
in the canonical book or books of Kings, but in the annals, journals,
and diaries, which each king took care to be kept with some exactness,
often referred to in the preceding books; out of which this writer,
under a divine direction, had taken what was proper to be continued, and
had carried the genealogy down to the captivity of the ten tribes; but
the genealogy being lost with them, he could proceed no further, nor say
anything more concerning them:

but Judah; for so the word should be stopped, and read according to the
Hebrew accents:

who were carried away to Babylon for their transgression; their
idolatry, and were now returned again; of them the writer proposes to
give a further account.

[1 Chronicles 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 9:2</span></span>

Now the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions in their
cities,.... Who first returned from Babylon upon the proclamation of
Cyrus, and enjoyed their former possessions, and dwelt in the cities
they had before, or in such as were allotted them, or they chose:

were, the Israelites, the priests, Levites, and the Nethinims; the whole
body that returned were divided into four classes, as they had been
before the captivity; the Israelites were the common people in general,
the body politic; the priests, the ecclesiastics, who officiated in
sacred things; the Levites, who ministered to them; and the Nethinims
were such persons as were "given", as the word signifies, to do servile
work for the sanctuary, as, to be hewers of wood and drawers of water;
such were the Gibeonites, [Jos 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#027.md),
and such as were appointed by David for such work, see [Ezr
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#020.md).

[1 Chronicles 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 9:3</span></span>

And in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of Judah, and of the children of
Benjamin,.... Of which tribes were the largest number that went into,
and returned out of, captivity:

and of the children of Ephraim and Manasseh; such of those tribes who
had joined the others when Jeroboam introduced his idolatry, or had fled
to them when Samaria was besieged and taken by Shalmaneser, and so went
into captivity with Judah, and now returned; and as many of them as took
the advantage of the proclamation of Cyrus, who were carried captive
with the ten tribes.

[1 Chronicles 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 9:4</span></span>

Uthai, the son of Ammihud,.... Called Athaiah, [Neh
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#004.md) though his ancestors there are
differently reckoned here; his genealogy here is traced from his father
Ammihud, through Omri, Imri, Bani, Pharez, to Judah.

[1 Chronicles 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 9:5</span></span>

And of the Shilonites,.... Not called so from the city of Shiloh, which
was in Ephraim; whereas these here intended were of the tribe of Judah,
and were either the descendants of a man whose name was Shiloni, [Neh
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#005.md) or rather these are the same with
the Shelanites, [Num 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#020.md) so called
from Shelah the son of Judah; and so the Targum here is,"and of the
tribe of Shelah:"

Asaiah the firstborn, and his sons; the same with Maaseiah, [Neh
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#005.md).

[1 Chronicles 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 9:6</span></span>

And of the sons of Zerah,.... Another son of Judah:

Jeuel, and their brethren; six hundred and ninety; or their kinsmen; for
this number includes all of the posterity of Pharez, Shelah and Zerah
mentioned.

[1 Chronicles 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 9:7</span></span>

And of the sons of Benjamin,.... Who were of the tribe of Benjamin, and
went with Judah into captivity, and returned with them, and such of them
as dwelt in Jerusalem before that:

Sallu the son of Meshullam; whose pedigree is differently given, [Neh
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#007.md),

the son of Hodaviah, the son of Hassenaah; perhaps these men had two
names, there called Joel and Pedaiah.

[1 Chronicles 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 9:8</span></span>

And Ibneiah the son of Jeroham,.... Who with two more, Elah and
Meshullam, whose ancestors are given, of whom we have no mention
elsewhere, were all of the tribe of Benjamin, said to settle at
Jerusalem.

[1 Chronicles 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch1 9:9</span></span>

And their brethren, according to their generations, nine hundred amd
fifty and six,.... Which was the number of the Benjaminites there
resident put together, and which greatly exceeded that of Judah, [Ch1
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#006.md).

all these men were chief of the fathers, in the house of their fathers;
principal men in the families of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, even
all the seven before mentioned.

[1 Chronicles 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 9:10</span></span>

And of the priests,.... Who returned and dwelt at Jerusalem:

Jedaiah, and Jehoiarib, and Jachin; Jedaiah was the son of Jehoiarib,
and Jachin is called Jachin, [Neh
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#010.md).

[1 Chronicles 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch1 9:11</span></span>

And Azariah the son of Hilkiah,.... That is, the son of Azariah, whose
name was Seraiah, see [Ch1 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#013.md), whose
pedigree is traced up from Hilkiah through Meshullam, called Shallum,
[Ch1 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#012.md). Zadok, Meraioth, to Ahitub:

the ruler of the house of God; high priest in it; which is to be
understood of Ahitub, and not of Azariah or Seraiah in the time of Ezra;
for Joshua was then high priest.

[1 Chronicles 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch1 9:12</span></span>

And Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pashur,.... In this genealogy,
between Jeroham and Pashur, were three more here omitted, Pelaliah,
Amzi, Zechariah, [Neh 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#012.md), and then
Pashur the son of Malchijah, as here:

and Maasiai the son of Adiel; whose pedigree is traced up from hence,
through Jahzerah, Meshullam, Meshillemith, to Immer; one of the five
heads of the courses settled by David, [Ch1
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#014.md). The names of this man, and of
his ancestors, are given, with some variation, in [Neh
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#013.md).

[1 Chronicles 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch1 9:13</span></span>

And their brethren, heads of the house of their fathers, one thousand
and seven hundred and threescore. These, with other priests, made up
this number, which was greater than those of Judah and Benjamin, that
dwelt in Jerusalem, put together:

very able men for the work of the service of the house of God: men that
had not only strength of body, which some part of the work of the
priests required; but had courage and fortitude of mind to set about the
service of God with cheerfulness, and to preserve it from corruption.

[1 Chronicles 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch1 9:14</span></span>

And of the Levites,.... Having given an account of the two first classes
of the people, the Israelites and priests, the author of the book now
proceeds to the Levites, the third class; and the first mentioned is
Shemaiah, whose ancestors, Hashub, Azrikam, and Hashabiah:

were of the sons of Merari; the third son of Levi.

[1 Chronicles 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch1 9:15</span></span>

And Bakbakkar, Heresh, and Galal, and Mattaniah,.... Four more of the
chief of the Levites, the pedigree of the last of which is traced up by
Micah and Zichri to Asaph, the singer in the times of David, a
descendant of Gershon, the first son of Levi; the first of these is
thought by Hillerus (t) to be the same with Bakbukiah, [Neh
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#017.md).

\(t\) Onamastic. Sacr. p. 401, 548.

[1 Chronicles 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 9:16</span></span>

And Obadiah the son of Shemaiah,.... Called Abda the son of Shammua,
[Neh 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#017.md).

the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun; who was Ethan, another of the
singers in the time of David:

and Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of Elkanah, that dwelt in the
villages of the Netophathites; the villages about Netophah, which was in
the tribe of Judah, [Ch1 2:54](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#054.md), [Neh
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#026.md) which may be understood either of
Elkanah, the ancestor of Berechiah, whose dwelling was there; or of
Berechiah, and must be rendered:

who had dwelt there; for now he dwelt at Jerusalem.

[1 Chronicles 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 9:17</span></span>

And the porters,.... Or keepers of the gates of the tabernacle:

were Shallum, and Akkub, and Talmon, and Ahiman, and their brethren;
Shallum was the chief; of these four porters, and their brethren.

[1 Chronicles 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 9:18</span></span>

Who hitherto waited in the king's gate eastward,.... At the gate through
which the king went into the temple, and was at the east of it; and here
these porters were placed in the same order after the captivity, and
their return from it, as before:

they were porters in the companies of the children of Levi; or in the
camp of Levi, which was placed around the tabernacle, as in the
wilderness: the Septuagint version is, "these are the gates of the camp
of the children of Levi"; at which these porters were placed.

[1 Chronicles 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch1 9:19</span></span>

And Shallum the son of Kore,.... The same as in [Ch1
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#017.md) whose pedigree is traced up to
Ebiasaph the son of Korah, see [Exo
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#024.md).

and his brethren, of the house of his father, the Korahites; so called,
because they descended from Korah:

were over the work of the service, keepers of the gates of the
tabernacle; until the temple was built:

and their fathers being over the host of the Lord; the Levites, who were
the Lord's army, and whose service is represented as a warfare, [Num
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#005.md).

were keepers of the entry; into the tabernacle, that none might enter
that were impure; or into the court of the priests, excepting priests;
or into the holiest of all, as Kimchi suggests.

[1 Chronicles 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 9:20</span></span>

And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the ruler over them in time
past,.... Over the host, over the Levites, and the chief of them; which
is to be understood of Phinehas the son of Eleazar, in the time of
Moses, who succeeded his father in that post, see [Num
3:32](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#032.md) though some think, as Kimchi
observes, that this was not Phinehas the priest, but a certain Levite of
this name in this post; but since he is said to be in time past, it may
very well be understood of him: and it also is observed:

and the Lord was with him; inspiring him with zeal for his honour and
glory, assisting and strengthening him to do his will and work, as
particularly in the affair of Zimri, [Num
25:7](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#007.md), the Targum is,"the Word of the
Lord was for his help;''

this may be said for the encouragement of him that was in the same
office now.

[1 Chronicles 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch1 9:21</span></span>

And Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah,.... Some think this refers to one
that was in the times of David; but it seems rather to respect one that
was after the Babylonish captivity, see [Ch1
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#001.md) though he and his brethren were
in an office established in the times of David, and the order of which
was now, as then, observed:

was porter of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: who was
the chief porter, and kept the door; either that led into the outer
court, and kept out all unclean persons from entering there; or that
which led into the court of the priests, that none but priests might
enter there.

[1 Chronicles 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 9:22</span></span>

All those that were chosen to be porters in the gates were two hundred
and twelve,.... As fixed in the days of David, and might not be fewer:

these were reckoned by their genealogies in their villages; where they
dwelt:

whom David and Samuel the seer did ordain in their set office; the
scheme was first drawn by Samuel the prophet, and communicated to David,
who put it into execution, to be constantly and perpetually observed.

[1 Chronicles 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch1 9:23</span></span>

So they and their children had the oversight of the gates of the house
of the Lord,.... They that were appointed in David's time to watch the
gates of the temple, their posterity succeeded them in that office; for
it was hereditary:

namely, the house of the tabernacle, by wards; that which was at Gibeon
in David's time, and now one was erected until the temple was built.

[1 Chronicles 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch1 9:24</span></span>

In four quarters were the porters,.... For, according to the Targum on
[Ch1 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#022.md) there were twenty four
wards:

towards the east, west, north, and south; and, as the same paraphrase
has it, six wards to the east, six to the west, six to the north, and
six to the south.

[1 Chronicles 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch1 9:25</span></span>

And their brethren, which were in their villages,.... Assigned them to
dwell in:

were to come after seven days from time to time with them; there was a
new course of them every week; the old ones went off of duty, and
another course succeeded, which came out of the villages where they
dwelt, and the old course retired to theirs.

[1 Chronicles 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch1 9:26</span></span>

For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in their set office,....
The four chief porters who were over all the two hundred and twelve, and
had one over them, [Ch1 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#017.md), these
were never changed, nor went into the country villages; but were always
upon the spot, and in their office, superintending the rest:

and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God; see [Ch1
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#020.md).

[1 Chronicles 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ch1 9:27</span></span>

And they lodged round about the house of God,.... In chambers on the
outward wall about it, that they might be near to do their office:

because the charge was upon them; to guard the house:

and the opening thereof every morning pertained to them; that is, the
opening of the doors of the mountain of the house, and the court of
women; for as for others, that appertained to the priests, as Dr.
Lightfoot (u) observes; under the second temple, it is said (w), Ben
Geber was over the shutting of the gates in the evening, and so of
opening in the morning.

[1 Chronicles 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">ch1 9:28</span></span>

And certain of them had the charge of the ministering vessels, that they
should bring them in and out by tale. Which the priests used in
sacrificing, and which the Levites brought to them, and returned again
to their proper places.

[1 Chronicles 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">ch1 9:29</span></span>

Some of them also were appointed to oversee the vessels, and all the
instruments of the sanctuary,.... They were committed to their care;
they delivered them out on occasion, and their business was to see that
they were returned when they had done their use and service:

and the fine flour, and the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and
the spices; which were used in meat offerings, drink offerings, &c. see
[Ch1 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#020.md) under the second temple,
Ahiah was over the libations or drink offerings (x).

[1 Chronicles 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">ch1 9:30</span></span>

And some of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the spices. For
though the Levites had the care of the spices, they might not make the
ointment with them, only the priests, see [Exo
30:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#023.md).

[1 Chronicles 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">ch1 9:31</span></span>

And Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who was the firstborn of Shallum the
Korahite,.... Of whom see [Ch1 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#019.md),

had the set office over the things that were made in the pans; the meat
offerings that were made in pans; and so had the care of the fine flour,
oil, and frankincense used in them, which he delivered to the priests
when necessary, see [Lev 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#005.md), the
Septuagint version is,"over the works of the sacrifice of the pan of the
high priest;''as if it respected peculiarly his meat offering, [Lev
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#020), we read in the Misnah (y.md) of the
offerings of the high priest, as expressed by this word, which it
signifies, and not pans, but what was fried in them (z); and Ben Melech
on the place says, this man was an high priest who offered every day the
tenth part of an ephah in a pan, half of it in the morning, and half of
it in the evening, according to [Lev
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#020.md), but that cannot be, for certain
it is he was a Levite, as the text expresses it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">ch1 9:32</span></span>

And other of their brethren, of the sons of the Kohathites, were over
the shewbread, to prepare it every sabbath,.... Twelve loaves of which
were set every week before the ark upon the shewbread table, and the old
ones taken away: now the work of these Levites was to make this
shewbread, and get it ready every week to be set upon the table, and
which was done not by them, but by priests; under the second temple, the
family of Garmu was set over this work (a).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">ch1 9:33</span></span>

And these are the singers, chief of the fathers of the Levites,....
Others of them were employed in singing, and were masters of the song,
and presided in that service, see [Ch1
6:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#031.md) who remaining

in the chambers were free; from all other work and service; and there
they abode, even in the chambers of the temple, that they might be near
to perform their work, and not be defiled, and made unfit for it:

for they were employed in that work day and night; some or other of
them, either in composing or singing psalms and hymns, or teaching
others how to sing them.

[1 Chronicles 9:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">ch1 9:34</span></span>

These chief fathers of the Levites were chief throughout their
generations,.... Even all before made mention of in this chapter:

these dwelt at Jerusalem; always resided there, and did not in turns go
into the country villages, as the inferior Levites did; their office
requiring them to be constantly there, being chief of the porters,
singers, &c. who had the superintendency and direction of the rest.

[1 Chronicles 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">ch1 9:35</span></span>

And in Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon,.... Whose name is here
mentioned, which is not in [Ch1 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#029.md).
Jehiel:

whose wife's name was Maachah; as there, but here called his sister, as
a wife sometimes is, [Gen 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#002.md). From
hence to the end of the chapter is a repetition of the ancestors and
posterity of Saul king of Israel; which is made to lead on to and
connect the following history of the kings of Judah, begun in this book,
and carried on in the next unto the Babylonish captivity, see [Ch1
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#029.md), and the notes there.
