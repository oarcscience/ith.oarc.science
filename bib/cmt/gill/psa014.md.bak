### [Psalms Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 14:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO PSALM 14

To the chief Musician, a Psalm of David. The argument of this psalm,
according to Theodoret, is Sennacherib's invasion of Judea, when he sent
Rabshakeh to Hezekiah, with menaces and curses; upon which Hezekiah
implored divine help, and obtained it, and the Assyrian army was
destroyed by an angel; of all which he thinks this psalm was prophetic.

[Psalms 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 14:1</span></span>

The fool hath said in his heart,.... This is to be understood not of a
single individual person, as Nabal, which is the word here used; nor of
some Gentile king, as Sennacherib, or Rabshakeh his general, as
Theodoret; nor of Nebuchadnezzar, nor of Titus, as some Jewish writers
(y) interpret it, making one to be here intended, and the other in the
fifty third psalm: the same with this; but of a body, a set of men, who
justly bear this character; and design not such who are idiots, persons
void of common sense and understanding; but such who are fools in their
morals, without understanding in spiritual things; wicked profligate
wretches, apostates from God, alienated from the life of God; and whose
hearts are full of blindness and ignorance, and whose conversations are
vile and impure, and they enemies of righteousness, though full of all
wicked subtlety and mischief: these say in their hearts, which are
desperately wicked, and out of which evil thoughts proceed, pregnant
with atheism and impiety; these endeavour to work themselves into such a
belief, and inwardly to conclude, at least to wish,

there is no God; though they do not express it with their mouths, yet
they would fain persuade their hearts to deny the being of God; that so
having no superior to whom they are accountable, they may go on in sin
with impunity; however, to consider him as altogether such an one as
themselves, and to remove such perfections from him, as may render him
unworthy to be regarded by them; such as omniscience, omnipresence, &c.
and to conceive of him as entirely negligent of and unconcerned about
affairs of this lower world, having nothing to do with the government of
it: and thus to deny his perfections and providence, is all one as to
deny his existence, or that there is a God: accordingly the Targum
paraphrases it,

"there is no "government" of God in the earth;''

so Kimchi interprets it,

"there is no governor, nor judge in the world, to render to man
according to his works;''

they are corrupt; that is, everyone of these fools; and it is owing to
the corruption of their hearts they say such things: they are corrupt in
themselves; they have corrupt natures, they are born in sin, and of the
flesh, and must be carnal and corrupt: or "they do corrupt", or "have
corrupted" (z): they corrupt themselves by their atheistic thoughts and
wicked practices, [Jde 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#010.md); or their
works, as the Chaldee paraphrase adds; or their ways, their manner and
course of life, [Gen 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#012.md); and they
corrupt others with their evil communications, their bad principles and
practices, their ill examples and wicked lives;

they have done abominable works: every sinful action is abominable in
the sight of God; but there are some sins more abominable than others;
there are abominable idolatries, and abominable lusts, such as were
committed in Sodom; and it may be these are pointed at here, and which
are usually committed by such who like not to retain God in their
knowledge; see [Rom 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#024.md);

there is none that doeth good; anyone good work in a spiritual manner;
not in faith, from love, in the name and strength of Christ, and with a
view to the glory of God: nor can any man do a good work without the
grace of God, and strength from Christ, and the assistance of the Spirit
of God: hence, whatsoever a wicked man does, whether in a civil or in a
religious way, is sin; see [Pro 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#004.md).
Arama takes these to be the words of the fool, or atheist, saying, there
is no God that does good, like those in [Zep
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#012.md).

[Psalms 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 14:2</span></span>

The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men,.... As he did
when all flesh had corrupted its way, and before he brought a flood upon
the world of the ungodly, [Gen 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#012.md).
This is said in direct opposition to the atheistic thoughts and
reasonings of wicked men, in [Psa
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md). There is a God, and he takes
notice of the children of men, and of what is done by them; though his
throne is in the heavens, and his dwelling there, yet he looks down from
thence, and takes cognizance of all human affairs. This must be
understood consistent with the omniscience and omnipresence of God; it
is an anthropopathy, or a speaking after the manner of men; and denotes
the exact notice which God takes, and distinct observation he makes, and
the perfect and accurate knowledge he has of men and their actions; see
[Gen 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#005.md);

to see if there were any that did understand: not things natural, civil,
and moral, but things spiritual as the Apostle Paul interprets the
words, [Rom 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#011.md). For though man has
not lost the natural faculty of his understanding, and may have an
understanding of the things of nature, yet not of the things of God,
until a supernatural light is put into him; not any spiritual
experimental knowledge of God in Christ, nor of the way of salvation by
Christ, nor of the work of the Spirit of God upon the heart, nor of the
doctrines of the Gospel, nor any true sight and sense of his own state
and condition;

and seek God; that is, "after God"; as the apostle in the same place
explains it; after the knowledge of him and his ways, and communion with
him; after the things of God, his interest and his glory: they do not
seek after him in prayer, or by an attendance on his worship and
ordinances; at least with their whole hearts, earnestly, diligently,
constantly, and in the first place; nor do they seek after him in
Christ, where he is only to be found; nor under the influence, and with
the assistance of the blessed Spirit.

[Psalms 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 14:3</span></span>

They are all gone aside,.... As bankrupts, having run out their whole
stock, and into debt, and have nothing to pay, nor make composition
with, and are obliged to abscond, as Adam, [Gen
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#008.md). The words in [Psa
53:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#003.md) are, "everyone of them is gone
back"; from God; have revolted from him, and turned their backs upon
him, and have gone back from his commandment, despised his law, and cast
away his word. The Apostle Paul interprets it, "they are all gone out of
the way"; out of God's way, into their own way; out of the path of
truth, righteousness, and holiness, into the way of sin, error,
darkness, and death; and with this agrees the interpretation of Aben
Ezra, who adds, "out of the right way"; and of Kimchi and Ben Melech,
whose gloss is, "out of the good way"; which is God's way, or the way of
his commandments;

they are all together become filthy, or "stinking" (a), like putrid and
corrupt flesh; see [Psa 38:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#005.md); and so
"unprofitable", useless, and good for nothing, as the apostle renders
it, [Rom 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#012.md). Mankind are universally
filthy and unclean; they are all of them defiled with sin, both in soul
and body, in all the faculties of their souls and members of their
bodies; and they are originally and naturally so; nor can anything
cleanse them from their pollution but the blood of Christ;

there is none that doeth good, no, not one: this is repeated partly to
asseverate more strongly the depravity of mankind, and partly to express
the universality of it; that there is no exception to it in any that
descend from Adam by ordinary generation. Here follows in the Septuagint
version, according to the Vatican copy, all those passages quoted by the
apostle, [Rom 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#013.md); which have been
generally supposed to have been taken from different parts of Scripture;
so the Syriac scholiast says, in some ancient Greek copies are found
eight more verses, and these are they, "Their throat", &c.

[Psalms 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 14:4</span></span>

Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge?.... Of the being of God,
of the nature of sin, and of the punishment due unto it? This question
is put either by way of admiration, as Kimchi and Aben Ezra observe; the
psalmist, or rather God speaking after the manner of men, wondering that
there should be such ignorance and stupidity among men, as before
expressed; or rather, as denying this to be the case, and affirming that
they have knowledge, notwithstanding they think, and say, and do, as
before related, as in [Rom 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#021.md). Do
not they know that there is a God? and that they are accountable to him
for their actions? Verily they do: for this is said, not of sinners of
the Gentiles; though even they, by the light of nature, know there is a
God, and show the work of the law written in their hearts; and have a
consciousness in them of good and evil; but of sinners in Zion, of the
profligate part of mankind among the Jews, who had a divine revelation,
by which they knew the one God of Israel; and a law, by which was the
knowledge of sin, and whose sanctions were rewards and punishments. And
it seems to design the chief among them, who had power over others, to
eat them up and devour them; even their political and ecclesiastical
governors see [Mic 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001.md), who, though
they had no spiritual understanding, nor experimental knowledge of
things, yet had a theoretical and speculative one; so that their sins
were attended with this aggravation, that they were against light and
knowledge, particularly what follows:

who eat up my people as they eat bread: not David's people, but the
Lord's people: see [Psa 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#002.md); whom he
chose for his people, who were his covenant people, and who professed
his name, and were called by it; these the workers of iniquity ate up,
devoured, and consumed; see [Jer
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#025.md); by reproaching and persecuting
them, doing injury to their persons, property, and character: they
devoured their persons, by using them cruelly and putting them to death;
they devoured their substance, by spoiling them of it, and converting it
to their own use, as the Pharisees are said to devour widows' houses and
they destroyed their good names and characters with their devouring
words: and this they did with as much ease, delight, and pleasure, and
without any remorse of conscience, and as constantly, as a man eats his
bread. Or the words may be rendered, "they eat up my people, they eat
bread"; that is, though they act such a wicked and cruel part, yet they
have bread to eat, and fulness of it; they are not in straits, nor
afflicted and punished; and because they are not, they are hardened in
their impiety and iniquity: or "they eat bread", after they have
persecuted and devoured the Lord's people, with peace of mind, without
remorse of conscience, as if they had done no iniquity, like the
adulterous woman in [Pro 30:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#020.md);

and call not upon the Lord; or pray to him, or serve and worship him;
for invocation includes the whole worship of God; and this they do not,
though they know him, and are daily supplied by him, and eat his bread.
Some read this clause with the former, "they eat bread, and call not on
the Lord"; as if their sin was, that when they eat bread, they did not
ask a blessing upon it, nor return thanks to God for it, which ought to
be done; but the accent "athnach" under "bread", will not admit of this
sense, though it seems to be countenanced by the Targum.

[Psalms 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 14:5</span></span>

There were they in great fear,.... This, shows that they had some
knowledge of God, and consciousness of guilt, which they endeavoured to
banish out of their minds by their fears of punishment; and these fears
men of the most atheistic principles cannot get rid of. In [Psa
53:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#005.md) it is added, "where no fear was":
that is, any cause or reason for it: such men are often frightened at
their own shadows, afraid to be in the dark alone, as Hobbes the atheist
was. The wicked flee when no man pursues, and are chased by the sound of
a shaken leaf; see [Pro 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#001.md); or where
there was no fear of God before their eyes, nor on their hearts, as well
as no regard to men; or where before there were perfect peace and
security, and no apprehension or dread of any calamity, ruin, and
destruction;

for God is in the generation of the righteous, or "of the righteous One"
(b); which some understood of Jesus Christ the righteous: and though the
age or generation in which he lived was a very wicked one, yet God was
with him; as was seen by the doctrines he taught, and the miracles he
wrought; and which filled the Jews with panic fears, lest the Romans
should come and take away their place and nation: but rather this is to
be understood of the generation of the saints, who are righteous through
the righteousness of Christ, and have the new man in them, which is
created in righteousness and true holiness, and live soberly and
righteously; these are sometimes called the generation of the upright,
and of the children of God, and of them that seek him, [Psa
112:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#002.md); in the midst of these God is,
among them he affords his gracious presence, and is with them, for their
help and assistance against their enemies: and as this makes them
fearless of them, it fills their enemies with dread and terror; see [Jos
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#009.md). The Targum renders it,

"the Word of the Lord is in the generation of the righteous.''

[Psalms 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 14:6</span></span>

You have shamed the counsel of the poor,.... The poor saints, the Lord's
people, the generation of the righteous, who are generally the poor of
this world; poor in spirit, and an afflicted people: and the counsel of
them intends not the counsel which they give to others, but the counsel
which they receive from the Lord, from the Spirit of counsel, which
rests upon them, and with which they are guided; and this is to trust in
the Lord, and to make him their refuge; and which is good advice, the
best of counsel. Happy and safe are they that take it! But this is
derided by wicked and ungodly men; they mock at the poor saints for it,
and endeavour to shame them out of it; but hope makes not ashamed; see
[Psa 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#007.md);

because the Lord is his refuge: he betakes himself to him when all
others fail; and finds him to be a refuge from the storm of impending
calamities, and from all enemies.

[Psalms 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 14:7</span></span>

O that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion!.... By whom is
meant the Messiah, the Saviour of Israel, of all the elect of God,
whether Jews or Gentiles; and who is so called, because the salvation of
them was put into his hands, and he undertook it; and because he is the
Captain and Author of it, and it is in him, and in no other. He was to
come out of Zion, out of Judea, from among the Jews; Zion being, as
Kimchi observes, the head of the kingdom of Israel; see [Rom
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026.md). Accordingly Christ did come of
the Jews, and salvation was of them, [Rom
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004.md); and for his coming from hence, or
for his incarnation, the psalmist most earnestly wishes: he was one of
those kings, prophets, and righteous men, that desired to see the days
of the Messiah, [Mat 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#017.md). And what
might move him so vehemently to wish for it, at this time, might be the
sad corruption and depravity of mankind he had been describing, and the
afflicted and distressed state of the saints;

when the Lord bringeth back the captivity of his people. The people of
God are, in their unregeneracy, in a state of captivity to sin, Satan,
and the law; the work of the Messiah, when he came, was to proclaim
liberty to the captives, to set them free, to deliver them from their
spiritual bondage: and this Christ has done; he has redeemed his people
from all their sins, and from the curse of the law, and from the power
of Satan, and has led captivity captive; and which has justly occasioned
great joy in the redeemed ones, according to this prophecy:

Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad; that is, the posterity of
Jacob and Israel; not his natural, but spiritual seed, such who are the
true sons of Jacob, Israelites indeed; these having faith and hope in
the plenteous redemption of Christ, rejoice in the view of their
interest in it; they the song of redeeming love now, and these ransomed
ones will hereafter come to Zion with joy, and everlasting joy upon
their heads. The Jews refer this to the times of the Messiah (c).
