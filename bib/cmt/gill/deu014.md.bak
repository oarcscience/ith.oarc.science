INTRODUCTION TO DEUTERONOMY 14

In this chapter some cautions are given against the use of some rites
and ceremonies in mourning for the dead, with the reason thereof, [Deu
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001.md) and instructions about what are
lawful to be eaten, and what not, whether of beasts, fishes, or fowl,
[Deu 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#003.md), and concerning eating one
sort of tithes both at the place God should choose, and within their own
gates, [Deu 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#022.md).

[Deuteronomy 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 14:1</span></span>

Ye are the children of the Lord your God,.... Some of them were so by
the special grace of adoption, and all of them by national adoption;
which was the peculiar privilege of the people of Israel, and laid them
under great obligation to honour and obey the Lord their God, who stood
in the relation of a father to them, and they of children to him, [Mal
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#006.md). The Targum of Jonathan
paraphrases it "beloved children"; so the apostle calls the saints; the
"dear children of God", who therefore ought to be followers of him, [Eph
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#001.md) and for a like reason this
relation is observed here, namely, to quicken a regard to the
exhortations of the Lord, his cautions, commands, laws, and ordinances,
particularly to what follows:

ye shall not cut yourselves; for the dead, as appears from the next
clause, as the Heathens did, who not only tore their garments, but their
flesh in several parts of their bodies, in their mouths, cheeks,
breasts, &c. (r); and used other extravagant signs of mourning, which
the apostle cautions against, [Th1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#013.md) and were condemned by the
Heathens themselves (s). Though some think this refers to incisions the
Heathens made in their flesh to the honour of their gods, cutting the
names of them therein to whom they devoted themselves; or lashing their
bodies at the worship of them, as the worshippers of Baal did when they
called upon him, [Kg1 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#028.md) and so the
Jerusalem Targum,"make not marks, marks,''that is, here and there, in
many places, or bruises black and blue by striping and beating
themselves, for strange worship, or at it, in honour of their gods; but
the former sense seems best to agree with what follows; see [Lev
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#028.md),

nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead; by shaving the
forepart of their head or their eyebrows, or both, which used to be done
in lamentations for the dead; see [Jer
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#006.md) if this could be thought to have
any respect to rites and ceremonies used in the worship of dead and
lifeless idols, the customs of the Egyptians might be referred to, who
are said to shave their heads and their eyebrows in their sacred rites
to Isis (t).

[Deuteronomy 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 14:2</span></span>

For thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God,.... Set apart by him
from all other people, and devoted to his worship and service, and many
of them were sanctified and made holy in a special and spiritual sense;
and therefore should not conform to the customs of Gentiles, whether in
their extravagant mourning for the dead, or in their religious services;
see [Deu 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#006.md),

and the Lord hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people, above all the
nations that are upon the earth; to be his peculiar treasure, to be his
peculiar servants and worshippers, to enjoy peculiar blessings and
privileges, and behave in a peculiar manner different from all other
people; and have no connection with them, especially in things sacred;
and, in order to keep them a distinct peculiar people from all others, a
peculiar diet was appointed them, that so being prohibited to eat such
things as others did, they might be kept out of their company and
conversation, and so from being drawn into their idolatrous practices;
the rules concerning which follow; see [Deu
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#006.md).

[Deuteronomy 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 14:3</span></span>

Thou shall not eat any abominable thing. That is so either in its own
nature, or because forbidden by the Lord; what are such are declared in
the following verses.

[Deuteronomy 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 14:4</span></span>

These are the beasts which they shall eat,.... That is, which they might
lawfully eat of, which were allowed for their food; for they were not
obliged to eat of them if they did not choose it:

the ox, the sheep, and the goat; which were creatures used in sacrifice,
and the only ones, yet nevertheless they might be used for food if
chosen.

[Deuteronomy 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 14:5</span></span>

The hart, the roebuck, and the fallow deer,.... All of the deer kind,
and very agreeable food; harts were very common in the land of Canaan
and parts adjacent; Aelianus says (u) harts are bred in the great
mountains in Syria, Amanus, Lebanon, and Carmel: the roebuck, or
"dorcas", from whence a good woman had her name, [Act
9:36](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#036) is spoken of by Martial (w.md) as
very delicious food, and so are fallow deer; the word "jachmur", here
used, having the signification of redness in it, may be used for that
sort which are called red deer: it is observed that in the Arabic
language it is used for an animal with two horns, living in the woods,
not unlike an hart, but swifter than that; and it is asked, is it not
the "aloe" or "elch" (x)?

and the wild goat, and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois; the
wild goat is reckoned by Pliny (y) among the half wild creatures in
Africa; according to the philosopher (z) there are none but in Syria, on
which Canaan bordered, and were very remarkable ones, having ears a span
and nine inches long, and some reached to the ground. The Hebrew name
for this creature is "akko"; and there is a fourfooted wild beast, by
the Tartarians called "akkyk", and by the Turks "akoim", and which with
the Scythians and Sarmatians are to be met with in flocks; it is between
a hart and a ram, its body whitish, and the flesh exceeding sweet (a);
it seems to be the same with the "tragelaphus", of which there were in
Arabia, as Diodorus Siculus (b) says; the next is the "pygarg", which we
so render from the Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions, or white
buttocks, so called from the hinder part of it being white; a species of
the eagle with a white tail is called a "pygarg", but here a four footed
animal is meant; and which is mentioned as such, along with hinds, does,
and goats, by Herodotus (c), Aelian (d), and Pliny (e): it has its name
"dishon", in Hebrew, from its ash colour, and the "tragelaphus", or goat
deer, has part of its back ash coloured, and has ash coloured spots or
streaks on its sides (f): some take it to be the "strepsiceros", a kind
of buck or goat with writhed horns, which the Africans, as Pliny says
(g), call "addaca", which is thought by some to be a corruption of
"al-dashen", so Junius; the Targum of Jonathan takes it for the
"unicorn" or "rhinoceros"; and the Talmudists say (h) that the unicorn,
though it has but one horn, is free, i.e. lawful to be eaten: the "wild
ox" was common in Arabia; Strabo (i) speaks of multitudes of wild oxen
in some parts of Arabia, on the flesh of which and other animals the
Arabians live; in the Septuagint version it is called the "oryx", which
is a creature that has but one horn, and divides the hoof (k), and so
might be eaten; See Gill on [Isa
51:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#020.md), the last, the "chamois", has a
French name, and is a creature of the goat kind, from whose skin the
chamois leather is made; in the figure of its body it seems to approach
very much to the stag kind (l); perhaps it is the same with the "cemas"
of Aelian (m), mentioned by him along with roebucks. Some take it to be
the "tarandus", of which Pliny says (n) it is of the size of an ox, has
a head bigger than a hart, and not unlike it; its horns are branched,
hoofs cloven, and is hairy like a bear. In the Targums of Onkelos and
Jonathan this is the "pygarg"; these several sorts of beasts were
allowed to be eaten; the three first there is no difficulty about them,
but the other seven it is hard to determine what they are, at least some
of them. Dr. Shaw (o) thinks that the deer, the antelope, the wild bear,
the goat deer, the white buttocks, the buffalo, and jeraffa, may lay in
the best claim to the "ailee", "tzebi", "yachmur", "akkub", "dishon",
"thau", and "zomer", here.

[Deuteronomy 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 14:6</span></span>

And every beast that parted the hoof,.... In this and the two following
verses two general rules are given, by which it might be known what
beasts were fit for food and what not; one is if they parted the hoof,
and the other if they chewed the cud, such might be eaten; but such that
only chewed the cud, but did not divide the hoof, as the camel, hare,
and coney, might not be eaten; and so if they divided the hoof, and did
not chew the cud, as the swine, they were alike unlawful; See Gill on
[Lev 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#003.md); see Gill on [Lev
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#004.md); see Gill on [Lev
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#005.md); see Gill on [Lev
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#006.md); see Gill on [Lev
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#007.md); see Gill on [Lev
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#008.md).

[Deuteronomy 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 14:9</span></span>

These ye shall eat of, all that are in the waters,.... The fishes there,
even such as have fins and scales, but they that have not were not to be
eaten: See Gill on [Lev 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#009.md), [Lev
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#010.md), [Lev
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#011.md), [Lev
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#012.md).

[Deuteronomy 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 14:11</span></span>

Of all clean birds ye shall eat. Which the Targum of Jonathan describes,
everyone that has a craw, and whose crop is naked, and has a superfluous
talon, and is not rapacious; but such as are unclean are expressed by
name in the following verses, so that all except them might be reckoned
clean and fit for food. Maimonides (p) observes, that only the number of
the unclean are reckoned, so that all the rest are free.

\(p\) Hilchot. Maacolot Asurot, c. 1. sect. 14.

[Deuteronomy 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 14:12</span></span>

But these are they of which they shall not eat,.... Jarchi observes,
that the unclean birds are particularly mentioned, to teach that the
clean sort are more than the unclean, and therefore the particulars of
the fewest are given: these are all the same names as in [Lev
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#013.md), excepting one, "the glede",
[Deu 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#013.md) which is a kind of kite or
puttock; the Jerusalem Targum renders it the vulture, and the Targum of
Jonathan the white "dayetha" or vulture; and Aristotle says (q) there
are two sorts of vultures, the one small and whiter, the other larger
and of many forms or colours; in Hebrew its name here is "raah", and is
thought to be the same with "daah" in [Lev
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#014.md) there translated the "vulture",
which has its name there from flying, and here from seeing, for which it
is remarkable; see [Job 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#007.md) and the
letters and are pretty much alike, and are sometimes changed, but there
is another here, in [Deu 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#013.md)
mentioned, the "dayah", which is not mentioned in [Lev
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#001.md), though some think it the same
with the "ayah", rendered both here and there the "kite"; perhaps it
means another sort of vulture, the black vulture, as the Targum of
Jonathan.

[Deuteronomy 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 14:19</span></span>

And every creeping thing that flieth is unclean,.... Which the Targum of
Jonathan thus paraphrases;"all flies and wasps (or hornets), and worms
of lentiles and of beans, which are separated from food, and fly as
birds, they are unclean;''See Gill on [Lev
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#020.md); see Gill on [Lev
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#021.md).

[Deuteronomy 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">deu 14:20</span></span>

But of all clean fowls ye may eat. Even of all fowls, but those before
excepted; Aben Ezra instances in the locust, as being a clean fowl, that
might be eaten; and so the Targum of Jonathan is"every clean locust ye
may eat;''see [Lev 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#022.md).

[Deuteronomy 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">deu 14:21</span></span>

Ye shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself,.... This law is
repeated from [Lev 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#015.md); see Gill on
[Lev 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#015.md),

thou shalt give it unto the stranger that is in thy gates, that he may
eat it; not to the proselyte of righteousness, for he might not eat of
it any more than an Israelite, and if he did, he was obliged to wash his
clothes, and bathe himself in water, and was unclean until the evening,
as in [Lev 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#015.md) but to a proselyte of
the gate, who took upon him, as Jarchi observes, not to serve idols, one
that has renounced idolatry, but has not embraced the Jewish religion;
such an one might eat of things that died of themselves, or were not
killed in a proper manner. The Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan call him
an uncircumcised stranger or proselyte, who had not submitted to
circumcision, as the proselyte of righteousness did:

or thou mayest sell it unto an alien; an idolater, one that was neither
a proselyte of righteousness nor of the gate, an entire alien from the
commonwealth of Israel; one that was occasionally in the land of Canaan,
or was travelling in it or through it, to such an one it might be sold:

for thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God; separated from all
others, and devoted to his service, and therefore must live on clean,
food and good meat, and not eat what others might:

thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother's milk; this is the third time
this law is mentioned; refer to the notes; see Gill on [Exo
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#019.md); see Gill on [Exo
34:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#026.md); the reason of which repetition,
the Jewish writers say (s), is, that it is once said to forbid the
eating it, a second time to forbid any use of it or profit by it, and a
third time to forbid the boiling of it.

\(s\) Maimon. & Bartenora in Misn. Kiddushin, c. 2. sect. 9.

[Deuteronomy 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">deu 14:22</span></span>

Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed,.... This was a
different tithe from that which was made and given to the Levites, and
out of which a tithe was taken and given to the priests, and which they
only ate of; but this, as appears by the following verse, was what the
owners themselves ate of, and so the tithing was left to be made by them
themselves, and which they were to be sure to make, and to make it truly
and faithfully:

that the field bringeth forth year by year; being ploughed and sowed
yearly, the produce of it was to be tithed yearly; the Jewish writers
(t) observe on this, that it must be what the earth produces, and is fit
for food: and it must be thy seed, which is especially thine, and is not
common, but has an owner, and this excludes mushrooms, &c. which thou
sowest not, and therefore cannot be called thy seed.

[Deuteronomy 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">deu 14:23</span></span>

And thou shalt eat before the Lord thy God, in the place which he shall
choose to place his name there,.... See [Deu
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#005.md) there the tithe of all the fruits
of the earth was to be eaten; this is the second tithe, as the Targum of
Jonathan, and so Jarchi, and which is more particularly described as
follows:

the tithe of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil: see [Deu
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#007.md),

and the firstlings of thine herds, and of thy flocks; of which see the
note on the above place:

that thou mayest learn to fear the Lord thy God always; which such a
constant practice would inure unto; see [Deu
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#012.md).

[Deuteronomy 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">deu 14:24</span></span>

And if the way be too long for thee,.... The way from the place where
any Israelite might live:

to carry it; the tithe and the firstlings, it would be too expensive or
too troublesome in any way that could be devised:

or if the place shall be too far from thee, which the Lord thy God shall
choose to set his name there; which by the event appeared to be the city
of Jerusalem, and this from some parts of the land of Canaan was very
distant:

when the Lord thy God hath blessed thee; with a large increase of the
fruits of the earth, and of flocks and herds.

[Deuteronomy 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">deu 14:25</span></span>

Thou shalt then turn it into money,.... The tithe, which would be
lighter and easier carriage:

and bind up the money in thine hand; put it into a bag or purse, and tie
it up and carry it in the hand; which some think was ordered, that it
might not be mixed with other money; but it seems only to have respect
to journeying, and making it fit for that. The Jewish writers (u), some
of them, give a different sense of the word we render "bind up", and
interpret it of marking the silver, or impressing a form, figure, or
image on it with the hand; they mean that it must be coined money; so
Maimonides (w), they may not profane the sacred tithe with money not
coined, nor with money not current, nor with money which is not in a
man's power; for it is said:

in thine hand; which the man is possessed of and is his own property:

and shalt go unto the place which the Lord that God shall choose;
carrying the money along with him, for which he sold the tithe.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">deu 14:26</span></span>

And thou shall bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth
after,.... He might buy what provision he would with it, what he best
liked, and was most agreeable to his appetite:

for oxen, or for sheep; he might purchase beef or mutton, or any other
sort of meat that could be got, and was lawful to be eaten, as before
directed:

or for wine, or for strong drink; to drink with his food, whether wine
or any other liquor; the Targum of Jonathan is, wine new or old, which
he chose; but the latter, strong drink, Aben Ezra says, was a liquor
made of honey and of dates, of wheat and of barley:

or for whatsoever thy soul desireth; whether eatable or drinkable:

and thou shalt eat there before the Lord thy God; he having put his name
in that place; and dwelling there, as the Lord did in the temple of
Jerusalem:

and thou shalt rejoice, thou and thy household; eat their food with
cheerfulness and gladness, making a feast of it and keeping it as such,
he and his whole family, his wife and children, or as many as were with
him; and all males were obliged to appear at the three grand yearly
festivals, and it was at one of these this was to be done.

[Deuteronomy 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">deu 14:27</span></span>

And the Levite that is within thy gates, thou shalt not forsake him,....
As not from giving him the first tithe, as Jarchi remarks, so he was not
to forget him in this; he was not to leave him behind, but take him with
him to partake of this entertainment:

for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee in the land: see [Deu
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#012.md).

[Deuteronomy 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">deu 14:28</span></span>

At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine
increase the same year,.... This, according to Aben Ezra, was a third
tithe, and did not excuse the second tithe; so says:"I gave the third
tithe to the repair of the temple,'' (Tobit 1:7)as in one copy, but,
according to another, to the stranger, fatherless, and widow, which
better agrees with what follows; but the Jewish writers generally
understand this as the same with the second tithe, which on the two
first years from the sabbatical year was carried to Jerusalem, or money
in lieu of it, with which provisions were bought and eaten there, but on
the third year were eaten in their own cities with the poor, and in the
stead of the other; so says Maimonides (x), on the third and sixth years
from the sabbatical year, after they have separated the first tithe they
separate from what remains another tithe, and give it to the poor, and
it is called the poor's tithe, and not on those two years is the second
tithe, but the poor's tithe, as it is said, "at the end of three years",
&c. and still more expressly elsewhere (y); after they have separated
the first tithe every year, they separate the second tithe, [Deu
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#022.md) and on the third and sixth years
they separate the poor's tithe instead of the second; and this was done,
not at the latter end of the third year, but, as Aben Ezra interprets
it, at the beginning; for the word used signifies an extremity, and the
beginning of the year is one extremity of it as well as the latter end
of it:

and lay it up within thy gates; not to be hoarded up, or to be sold at a
proper time, but to be disposed and made use of as follows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">deu 14:29</span></span>

And the Levite, because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee,....
Shall come and take the first tithe, according to Jarchi; but though
this he was to do, yet is not what is intended here, but he was to
partake of the second tithe, or what was in the room of it, the poor's
tithe, with whom he is here joined:

and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, which are within
thy gates, shall come; and take the second tithe, as the above writer
rightly interprets it, and which he says is the poor's of this year; see
[Deu 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#012.md),

and shall eat and be satisfied; make a plentiful meal, eat freely as at
a feast; and, as the same writer observes, they were not obliged to eat
it at Jerusalem, according to the way they were bound to eat the second
tithe of the two years, that is, the two preceding this:

that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which
thou doest; as might be expected, when his commands, and particularly
those respecting the tithes and firstlings, were obeyed.
