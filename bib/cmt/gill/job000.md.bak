INTRODUCTION TO JOB

This book, in the Hebrew copies, generally goes by this name, from Job,
who is however the subject, if not the writer of it. In the Vulgate
Latin version it is called "the Book of Job"; in the Syriac version, the
Writing of Job; and in the Arabic, the Writing or Book of Job the Just.
In some Hebrew Bibles it stands between the Book of Proverbs and the
Song of Solomon; but, according to the Talmudists (a), it should stand
between the Psalms of David and the Proverbs of Solomon. Some have made
a question of it, whether there ever was such a man as Job, and suppose
this book not to be a real history, or to contain matters of fact, but
to be written under fictitious names, and to be parabolical, and that it
is designed to set forth an example of patience in suffering affliction;
and some of the Jewish writers (b) affirm, that Job never was in being,
and that this book is a parable, apologue, or fable; and to this
Maimonides (c) himself inclines; but this opinion is justly rejected by
Aben Ezra, Peritsol, and others; for that there was such a man is as
certain as that there were such men as Noah and Daniel, with whom he is
mentioned by the Prophet Ezekiel, [Eze
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#014.md) and the testimony of the Apostle
James is full to this purpose, who speaks of him as a person well known,
and not to be doubted of; of whom, and of whose patience, the Jews he
writes to had heard much, [Jam 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#011.md)
besides, the names of the countries where he and his friends lived, the
account given of his family, and of his substance, both before and after
his afflictions, show it to be a real history. Learned men are not
agreed about the signification of his name; according to Jerom (d), it
signifies a magician, taking it to be the same with "ob": and some
Jewish writers (e) place him with Balaam and Jethro, as the counsellors
of Pharaoh against the Israelites, for which he was afflicted: the same
ancient fathers render the word grieving and howling; others, as
Spanheim (f), derive it from to "love" or "desire", and so it signifies
desire or delight, and is the same with Desiderius or Erasmus; hence Job
is called by Suidas (g) exceeding desirable; but Hillerus (h), deriving
it from the same root, makes it to signify just the reverse, "without
desire"; or not desirable; and supposes it to be a compound of "desire",
and "not"; but the generality of writers derive it from "to be at
enmity", and so it signifies one that is exposed to the hatred and
enmity of men, or one that is a hater and enemy of wicked men; or, as
Schmidtt (i) interprets it, a man zealous for God, and showing hatred to
wickedness and wicked men on his account. Who Job was, it is not easy to
say; not the same with Jobab, of the race of Esau, as some, [Gen
36:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#033). Aristeas (k.md) says he was a son
of Esau himself, by his wife Bessare, and was first called Jobam; nor
the same with Job a son of Issachar, [Gen
46:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#013.md), nor was he a descendant of
Abraham by Keturah; but rather sprung from Uz, the firstborn of Nahor,
brother of Abraham, [Gen 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#021.md), who
gave name to the country where Job lived, as Buz his brother did to that
of which Elihu was, and as Chesed, another brother of Uz, did to the
Chasdim or Chaldeans, who were both near to Job. It is also not agreed
in what time Job lived; Maimonides (l) says, of their writers some place
him in the times of the patriarchs, some in the times of Moses, others
in the times of David, and others say that he was of the wise men of
Babylon; and some add, that he was of them that came out of the
captivity there, and had a school at Tiberias, as say the Talmudists (m)
who give very different accounts of him: some say he was in the times of
the judges; others in the times of the queen of Sheba; and others in the
times of Ahasuerus; but the more general opinion is, and indeed the more
probable, that he was born when the Israelites went down into Egypt, and
that he was dead when they came from thence (n): in short, they place
him almost in all the ages from Abraham to the Babylonish captivity, and
after it; and even Luther (o) was of opinion that he lived in the times
of Solomon, for which there is no more reason than for the rest: it
seems most probable that he lived before Moses (p), at least before the
giving of the law to him, since no mention is made of it in this book,
nor any reference to it; whereas there is to things more ancient, as the
general deluge, the burning of Sodom, &c. the law concerning sacrifices
only to be offered by priests was not as yet given; for Job offered
sacrifices as being the head of his family, and so did his three
friends, [Job 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#005.md). The length of his
life best agrees with the times before Moses, for in his time the age of
man was reduced to seventy years; whereas Job must live two hundred
years or more, since he lived one hundred and forty after his
restoration: add to this, that this book seems to have been written
before any idolatry was in the world but the worship of the sun and
moon, [Job 31:25](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#025.md) and before there were
any writings divinely inspired, since there is no appeal to any in the
whole controversy between Job and his friends; but the appeal is made to
men of years and wisdom, and to traditions of former times, [Job
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#001). According to Dr. Owen (q.md) Job
lived three hundred and fifty years after the dispersion at Babel, about
A. M. 2100. It is also greatly controverted who was the writer of this
book; some ascribe the writing of it to Isaiah the prophet; others to
Solomon, as Luther (r); others to one of the prophets who was an
Idumaean; but most to Moses, so the Jews (s) say, that he wrote his own
book, the section of Balaam, and Job. Some think that he wrote it when
in Midian, for the comfort and encouragement of the Hebrews afflicted in
Egypt at that time, and who might hope to be delivered out of their
afflictions, as this good man was delivered out of his; and this, it is
supposed, accounts for the use of many Arabic words in it; Midian being
in Arabia, where Moses, having lived some years, had mixed their
language with his own. Some are of opinion that he met with this book
when in those parts, which he found either in the Arabic or Syriac
language, and translated it into Hebrew (t) for the use of the
Israelites; and others think it was written by Job's friends, and
particularly by Elihu, which is concluded from [Job
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#015.md), but it is most probable that it
was written by Job himself, or at least compiled from his diary or
"adversaria" kept by him, or from those of his friends, or from both,
and that it was written in the language it is now in: but be it written
by whom it may, there is no doubt to be made of the divine authority of
it; as appears from the sublimity of the style, the subject matter of
it, its agreement with other parts of the sacred writings, and
particularly from a quotation of a passage out of [Job
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#013.md) by the Apostle Paul, [Co1
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#019.md) see also [Job
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#017.md), compared with [Heb
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#005.md). The design of it is not only in
general to assert and explain the doctrine of Providence, as Maimonides
observes; but in particular to show, that, though good men are
afflicted, yet sooner or later they are delivered out of their
afflictions; and that it becomes them to bear them patiently, and not
murmur at them; nor complain of God on account of them, whose ways and
works are unsearchable, and who gives no account of his matters to men,
but is sovereign, wise, and just, in all he does; and whatsoever is done
by him issues in the good of his people, as well as in his own glory, as
the event shows. This book may be considered either as an history of the
life of Job, in which an account is given of him in his prosperity; of
his afflictions, and how they came upon him; of a visit paid him by his
friends, and of the discourses that pass between him and them, and of
his restoration to greater affluence than he enjoyed before: or as a
drama or dialogue consisting of divers parts, and in which various
speakers are introduced, as God, Satan, Job, his wife, and friends; or
as a dispute, in which Job's three friends are the opponents, himself
the respondent, Elihu the moderator, and God the umpire, who settled and
determined the point in question. It contains many useful things in it
concerning the Divine Being, and the perfections of his nature, his
wisdom, power, justice, goodness, and sovereignty; concerning the works
of creation and providence; concerning original sin, and the corruption
of mankind; concerning redemption by Christ, and good works to be done
by men; and concerning the resurrection of the dead, and eternal life.
Some think Job was a type of Christ in his afflictions and sufferings;
in his patience under them, and deliverance out of them; in his
exaltation to an high pitch of happiness and prosperity; and in his
intercession for his friends. He is in many things worthy of imitation,
though in others to be blamed, and not followed; and, on the whole, this
book of his may be read with great pleasure and profit.
