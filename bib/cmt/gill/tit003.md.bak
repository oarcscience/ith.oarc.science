INTRODUCTION TO TITUS 3

In this chapter the apostle exhorts Titus to press various duties
incumbent on Christians, with arguments engaging to them; gives him some
directions about dealing with heretics, and some instructions about
private matters, and particular persons, and closes it with salutations.
And first, he charges him to put his hearers in mind of their duty, to
be subject to civil magistrates, and readily perform whatever is right
and proper for them to do; and to abstain from blaspheming and brawling,
and to exercise gentleness and meekness to all men, [Tit
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#001.md). The arguments inducing thereunto
are taken partly from their former state and condition, while
unregenerate: when they were as ignorant and as wicked as other men,
they are exhorted to behave well to; and partly from the consideration
of the salvation they were now partakers of, [Tit
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#003.md) which leads on the apostle to give
an account of its causes and means: the moving cause of it is the love
and mercy of God; the way and means in which it is brought about, are
not works of righteousness done by men, but the regenerating and
renewing grace of the Spirit, which is plentifully bestowed through
Jesus Christ the Saviour, and justification by the free grace of God, by
virtue of which men become heirs unto, and have an hope of eternal life,
[Tit 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#004.md) which several blessings of
grace should be constantly insisted on in the ministry of the word, in
order to engage believers carefully to perform good works; and because
such doctrines are good in themselves, and profitable to men; whereas
questions, genealogies, contentions, and strivings about the law, are
foolish, vain, and unprofitable, and to be avoided, [Tit
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#008.md), wherefore an heretical man should
be rejected from all Christian conversation and communion, after he has
been admonished at least twice, seeing he is off of the foundation, has
sinned, and is self-condemned, [Tit
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#010.md). Next the apostle desires Titus
to meet him at Nicopolis, where his design was to pass the winter, upon
sending two ministering brethren to Crete, who are mentioned by name,
[Tit 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#012.md) and that he would
accommodate two others, who are also named, with everything convenient
for their journey, [Tit 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#013.md) and
charges him to exhort the brethren under his care to learn to be
diligent and industrious in the performance of good works, which have
their necessary uses, and prevent unfruitfulness, [Tit
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#013.md). And the epistle is concluded
with salutations, and the apostle's usual benediction, [Tit
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#015.md).

[Titus 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">tit 3:1</span></span>

Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers,.... Not
angels, good or bad, which are sometimes so called, but men in high
places; the higher powers ordained of God, as the apostle elsewhere
calls them; and which the Apostle Peter distinguishes into the king as
supreme, and into governors under him: the Roman emperor and senate, the
consuls, and proconsuls, deputies and governors of provinces and
islands, are here meant; particularly such who were appointed over the
island of Crete. Now the reasons why the apostle exhorts Titus to put in
remembrance those that were under his care, to yield a cheerful
subjection to their superiors, were, because the Jews, from whom the
Christians were not distinguished by the Romans, were reckoned a
turbulent and seditious people; which character they obtained, partly
through the principles of the Scribes and Pharisees, which they at least
privately entertained, as not to give tribute to Caesar, or be under any
Heathen yoke; and partly through the insurrections that had been made by
Judas of Galilee, and Theudas, and others; and besides, there were many
Jews in the island of Crete, and the Cretians themselves were prone to
mutiny and rebellion: to which may be added, that the false teachers,
and judaizing preachers, that had got among them, despised dominion, and
were not afraid to speak evil of dignities, according to the characters
which both Peter and Jude give of them, and taught the saints to abuse
their Christian liberty, and use it for a cloak of maliciousness, to the
great scandal of the Christian religion.

To obey magistrates; inferior ones; in all things that are according to
the laws of God, and right reason, that do not contradict what God has
commanded, or break in upon the rights and dictates of conscience; in
all things of a civil nature, and which are for the good of society, and
do not affect religion, and the worship of God: hence it follows,

to be ready to every good work; which may be taken in a limited and
restrained sense, and design every good work enjoined by the civil
magistrate; and all right and lawful obedience that belongs to him, as
giving to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, tribute, custom, fear,
and honour to whom they are due; and which should be done readily and
cheerfully: or it may be understood more comprehensively of good works
in general, which wicked men are reprobate to, and unfit for; and which
they that are sanctified are meet for, and ready to; though this may not
only intend their capacity, fitness, and qualifications, for the
performance of good works, but their alacrity, promptitude, and
forwardness unto them.

[Titus 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">tit 3:2</span></span>

To speak evil of no man,.... As not of one another, so not of the men of
the world, to the prejudice of their names and characters, which are
tender things, and ought to be gently touched; nor of magistrates,
principalities, and powers, of persons in dignity and authority, which
the false teachers were not afraid to speak evil of, and by their
principles and practices taught others to do the same:

to be no brawlers; or "fighters", either by blows or words; not
litigious and quarrelsome, wrangling and striving about things to no
profit, and to the detriment and disturbance of civil government,
churches, neighbourhood, and families; which is very unbecoming the
followers of Jesus, who strove not, nor cried, nor was his voice heard
in the streets. But gentle, showing all meekness to all men; yielding
and giving way, rather choosing to suffer wrong than to brawl, contend,
and litigate a point; taking the advice of Christ in [Mat
5:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#039.md), carrying it in a meek and humble
manner to men of all ranks and degrees, whether superior or inferior,
rich or poor, bond or free, Jews or Gentiles, members of the church, or
men of the world.

[Titus 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">tit 3:3</span></span>

For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish,.... Nothing has a greater
tendency to promote humility, and check pride in the saints, than to
reflect upon their past state and condition, what they themselves once
were; and this is a reason why magistrates, though evil men, should be
obeyed in things good and lawful, and why no man should be spoken evil
of, and why every man should be treated in a gentle manner, and used
with mildness and meekness; since the apostle himself, and Titus, and
other saints, whom he designed this as an instruction for, were
formerly, in their unregenerate state, just such persons themselves; and
therefore should not glory over them, and treat them in a contemptuous
manner: and besides, the same grace that had made a difference in them,
could make one in these also, and which might be made in God's own time:
and particularly, whereas they observed great ignorance in these men,
they should consider that they also had been "foolish", and without
understanding of things, divine and spiritual, and neither knew their
own state and condition, nor the way of salvation by Christ; yea, the
apostle himself, though he had a zeal for God, yet not according to
knowledge; he did not know lust, nor the exceeding sinfulness of sin,
until he was enlightened by the Spirit of God; he was ignorant of the
righteousness of God, and went about to establish his own, which he
imagined to be blameless; and thought he ought to do many things
contrary to the name of Jesus:

disobedient; both to the law of God, and Gospel of Christ; disbelieving
the truths of the Gospel, and not subjected to the ordinances of it,
notwithstanding the evidence with which they came, and the miracles by
which they were confirmed.

Deceived; by the old serpent Satan, who deceives the whole world; and by
an evil heart of unbelief, as well as by false teachers and leaders; and
so, as the word signifies, were wandering about in darkness and
ignorance, and were as sheep going astray, until they were returned unto
the Shepherd and Bishop of souls.

Serving divers lusts and pleasures; the lusts of the flesh are many and
various, which promise pleasure to them that obey them, though that is
but imaginary, and very short lived, and which subjects persons to
bondage and slavery; for such who indulge to these things, are overcome
by them, led captive, and brought into bondage, and are the servants of
sin, vassals and slaves to their own corruptions; and such these saints
had been, here spoken of:

living in malice and envy; they had not only malice and envy in their
hearts against their fellow creatures, but practised it in their lives;
yea, their lives were a continued series of malice and envy;
particularly this was true of the apostle, who haled men and women out
of their houses, and committed them to prison; breathed out slaughter
and threatenings against the saints; was exceedingly mad against them,
persecuted them to strange cities, and compelled them to blaspheme, and
gave his vote for punishing them with death.

Hateful, and hating one another; abominable in the sight of God, as
considered in themselves, and on account of their nature and practices;
and to be abhorred by all good men; and who, by their continual feuds,
quarrels, and animosities among themselves, showed an hatred, an
abhorrence of one another.

[Titus 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">tit 3:4</span></span>

But after that,.... After all this series and course of wickedness;
notwithstanding all this foolishness, disobedience, deception, bondage
to sin, envy, malice, and malignity; or "when" all this was, as the word
may be rendered, amidst all this iniquity; when these persons were in
the full career of sin, and so had done no preparatory works, or had any
previous qualifications and dispositions for the grace of God:

the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared; unto them;
and the Ethiopic version adds, "unto us". The apostle takes the
advantage of the above character of himself, and others in their former
state, to set off and magnify the grace of God in their conversion; so
contraries, as black and white, illustrate each other. By "God our
Saviour" is not meant the Lord Jesus Christ, though he is commonly
designed by our Saviour, and is several times called God our Saviour in
this epistle; see [Tit 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#003.md) and who is
truly God, and the only Saviour of lost sinners; and whose kindness and
love towards them has appeared in many instances; as in his suretiship
undertakings for them, in his assumption of their nature, and in his
suffering and dying in their room and stead: and yet it appears from
[Tit 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#006.md) that God our Saviour here, is
distinguished from Jesus Christ our Saviour there; and therefore here
must be understood of God the Father; who contrived the scheme of
salvation, appointed Christ to be his salvation, and made a covenant
with him, in which it secured, and sent him in time to obtain it, and
through his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice, saves all his people:
it is his kindness and love to men that is here spoken of; and which
designs not his general and providential goodness and kindness, which
extends to the whole human nature, and to all the individuals of it; but
his special love and grace shown in his kindness in Christ Jesus; that
good will to men the angels sung of at Christ's incarnation; or that
free favour and love of God towards elect men, which is sovereign and
special, from everlasting to everlasting, unchangeable and unspeakable,
which is better than life; the excellency of which cannot be expressed,
and which has shown itself in various instances: it is said to have
"appeared"; because it was hid from all eternity in the heart of God, in
the thoughts of his heart, in his purposes, counsel, and covenant, and
has been made manifest in time; particularly, it has broke forth and
showed itself in the mission of Christ into this world, and in
redemption and salvation by him; wherein God has manifested and
commended his love, and shown forth the exceeding riches of his grace;
and also in the effectual calling, which being a time of life, is a time
of love, and is owing to the great love of God, and is a fruit and
evidence of his everlasting and unchangeable love; and it is this
instance and appearance of it, which is here meant, since it follows the
account of the state and condition of the saints by nature; and is what
was made to them when in this state, by which means they were brought
out of it.

[Titus 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">tit 3:5</span></span>

Not by works of righteousness which we have done,.... The great instance
of the kindness and love of God our Saviour is salvation; which the
apostle denies that it is brought about by any works, even the best
works of men; for "works of righteousness" are works done according to a
righteous law, and in obedience to it; and in a righteous manner, from
right principles of grace, in faith, and with a view to the glory of
God; or otherwise they are not righteous actions, or works of
righteousness; wherefore not works before, but after conversion, are
here meant; for works before conversion are not properly works of
righteousness: besides, these are such which we have done, who formerly
were as before described, but now are regenerated and renewed by the
Holy Ghost, and created in Christ Jesus unto good works. Now salvation,
neither in whole, nor in part, is by these, either as causes;
conditions, or means; See Gill on [Ti2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#009.md); , "works of righteousness", is a
Jewish phrase used for righteous or good works (z).

but according to his mercy he saved us; the mercy of God is natural and
essential to him, but the actings and exercise of it, towards this or
the other objects, are sovereign and free, and according to his will;
the effects of it are many, he is rich and abundant in it; and they are
channelled in, and flow forth through the blood and righteousness of
Christ; and this is the moving cause of salvation: this moved God to
make a covenant with his Son, the blessings of which are the sure
mercies of David, and in which God is merciful to the sins and
unrighteousnesses of his people; it is owing to the tender mercy of God,
that Christ, the dayspring from on high, has visited the earth; and the
glory of it is very conspicuous in the affair of redemption by him; the
pardon of sin is according to the multitude of God's tender mercies; and
regeneration springs from the abundance of it; and even eternal life is
the effect of it. Now according to this, God has "saved" his people;
salvation is not only a thing determined, and resolved on in the mind of
God, but is actually and completely accomplished by Jesus Christ, and an
application of it is made to the saints in effectual calling; and
because of the certain enjoyment of the whole of it, even eternal glory,
the saints are said to be saved already; as they are also in faith and
hope, as well as in Christ, their head and representative; See Gill on
[Eph 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#008.md). It follows, as the means of
salvation,

by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; by the
former is meant, not the ordinance of water baptism; for that is never
expressed by washing, nor is it the cause or means of regeneration; the
cause being the Spirit of God, and the means the word of God: and
besides, persons ought to be regenerated before they are baptized; and
they may be baptized, and yet not regenerated, as Simon Magus; nor is it
a saving ordinance, or a point of salvation; nor can it be opposed to
works of righteousness, as this washing is; for that itself is a work of
righteousness; see [Mat 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#015.md) and if
persons were saved by that, they would be saved by a work of
righteousness, contrary to the text itself: but regenerating grace is
meant, or a being born of water, and of the Spirit; that is, of the
grace of the Spirit, comparable to water for its purity and cleansing
virtue: hence such who are regenerated and sanctified, are said to be
washed and cleansed, having their hearts purified by faith, and their
consciences purged from sin by the blood of Christ: by the latter,

the renewing of the Holy Ghost, is meant either the fruit and effect of
the former, even newness of life and conversation, under the influence
of the Holy Spirit; or else the gradual increase and progress of the
work of grace upon the soul, renewed day by day in the spirit of the
mind, by the Holy Ghost; or rather it means the same thing with
regeneration, and is added partly as explanative of the washing of
regeneration, showing that that is no other than the new creature, the
new man, the new heart, and new spirit, formed in the soul, in the
effectual calling; and partly to observe that the Holy Ghost is the
author of it. Now it is in this way God saves his people, namely, by
regenerating and renewing them; in this is the first appearance and
discovery of the love of God to them; this is their open passage into a
state of grace, and without this there is no entrance into glory; this
is the foundation of all grace and good works, and by which saints
appear to be heirs of the heavenly inheritance.

\(z\) Seder Tephillot, Ed. Amsterdam, fol. 46. 2.

[Titus 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">tit 3:6</span></span>

Which he shed on us abundantly,.... "Or richly"; either which love he
shed abroad in the hearts of those whom he regenerated and renewed by
his Spirit; or which water of regeneration, that is, grace, comparable
to water, he plentifully shed, and caused to abound where sin had done;
or rather whom, or which Holy Spirit, with his gifts and graces, such as
faith, hope, and love, and every other, he poured forth in great
abundance on them; see [Isa 44:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#003.md)

through Jesus Christ our Saviour; the love and kindness of God the
Father our Saviour, comes through him; the mercy of God streams through
him; the salvation itself is by, and through him; the grace communicated
in regeneration and renovation is out of his fulness; the Spirit himself
is given forth from him; and every supply of grace, by which the work is
carried on, comes out of his hands; and everything wrought in us, that
is well pleasing in the sight of God, is through him; and even the gift
of God, eternal life itself.

[Titus 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">tit 3:7</span></span>

That being justified by his grace,.... This is another way and means, as
well as regeneration, by which God saves his people; for he saves no
unjustified ones; no unrighteous persons shall inherit the kingdom of
heaven; such as are without the wedding garment, and robe of Christ's
righteousness, shall be cast into outer darkness: whom God saves, he
justifies by the righteousness of his Son; and whomsoever he justifies,
them he saves. The justification here spoken of is a declarative one,
which takes place in regeneration; and which that is in order to, as
here expressed, "that being justified": regeneration does not justify
any, but makes the justified to appear to be such; justification is an
act of God's gracious will conceived in his mind from eternity, by which
he wills not to impute sin to his people, but to Christ their surety;
and that they should be accounted righteous through the righteousness of
his Son; in which act of his will the whole essence of justification in
his sight lies: this was pronounced on Christ, as their head and
representative at his resurrection, when he, as such, was justified,
acquitted, and discharged, and they in him; and this is declared in the
conscience of a sinner, by the Spirit of God, at his regeneration, when
he passes from death to life; and this declaration is here intended, and
which is the same with justification by faith; and is here said to be by
the grace of God, as justification in every view is, and stands opposed
to works of righteousness done by men, by which no man can be justified
in the sight of God; in what sense justification is by the free grace of
God; see Gill on [Rom 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024.md).

We should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life; or
"according to hope we should be made heirs of eternal life". Eternal
life is an inheritance, and so is not acquired by labour and industry,
nor purchased, but is a free gift; it is a bequest of God the Father to
his children, of his own free good will and pleasure; and it belongs
only to children; they only are heirs, and they become such by adopting
grace; neither regeneration, nor justification, make them the children
of God, and heirs of the grace of life, but make them appear to be so:
God, by his gracious act of adoption puts them among the children, and
gives them the goodly heritage; and this adoption lies in eternal
predestination in Christ, in whom the inheritance is obtained on that
account, [Eph 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#005.md). Regeneration shows
them to be the adopted ones, and gives them the nature of children, and
a meetness for the inheritance; and justification gives them a right
unto it, upon the foot of justice, and opens a way for their enjoyment
of it, consistent with the justice and holiness of God; see [Gal
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004.md), wherefore such as are washed with
the washing of regeneration, and are renewed in the spirit of their
minds, and justified by the grace of God; these are manifestly heirs of
eternal life, of salvation, of a kingdom and glory, of all things, even
of God himself, who is their portion, and exceeding great reward; and
such in regeneration are begotten to a lively hope of it, and by this
they are saved, [Rom 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#024.md). And thus
the apostle makes regeneration by the free mercy of God, and
justification by his grace, and special adoption, and heirship, with a
good hope through grace, the way and means in which God saves his
people, who were like others by nature, and brings them to the enjoyment
of eternal happiness.

[Titus 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">tit 3:8</span></span>

This is a faithful saying,.... Meaning the whole of what is before
expressed, concerning the state and condition of God's elect by nature;
the appearance of the love and kindness of God to them in the effectual
calling; the salvation of them, according to the mercy of God, and not
by works of righteousness; regeneration, and renovation by the Spirit of
God, in which such an abundance of grace is communicated; and
justification by the free grace of God, as God's way of salvation; and
by which men are made to appear to be heirs of eternal life, and to have
hope of it: now all, and each of this is a faithful saying, is true
doctrine, and to be believed, professed, and published: wherefore it
follows,

and these things I will that thou affirm constantly; that is, the above
doctrines; the Arabic version renders it, "I will that thou be firm in
these things"; and the Syriac and Ethiopic versions, "I will that thou
confirmest them": the sense of the apostle is, that he would have Titus
be assured of those truths himself; be at a point about them, and
without any doubt or hesitation concerning them; and abide firm and
constant in them, and speak of them with certainty, boldness, and
confidence to others; and endeavour to confirm and establish them in
them: for which purpose he would have them be frequently inculcated and
insisted on; and that with this further view,

that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good
works; for "that", does not design the subject matter of the charge, or
what the apostle would have constantly affirmed, but the end, and final
event and issue of it; and nothing can more strongly engage to a
studious concern for the performance of good works than the frequent
insisting upon the above doctrines of grace: "by good works", are meant,
not merely honest trades, and the lawful occupations and businesses of
life, which should be carefully attended to, and diligently followed, in
order to be useful and profitable to themselves, their families, and
others; but every good work, every branch of duty, moral, civil, and
religious: to "maintain" these according to the signification of the
word used, is to excel in them; to outdo others; to go before others, by
way of example, and so to provoke to love and to good works; and to make
them the employment and business of men's lives; for which there should
be a thoughtfulness, a carefulness, a studious concern, especially in
those who "have believed in God"; who are regenerated and renewed by the
Spirit of God, and are justified by faith in the righteousness of
Christ; who believe in him for peace, pardon, righteousness, life, and
salvation: these are under great obligations to perform good works; the
love of Christ should constrain them to them; and they are the only
persons that are capable of doing them well, for they are sanctified,
and made meet, and ready for every good work; they are created in Christ
Jesus to them; they have the Spirit of Christ in them, and the strength
of Christ with them, without which they cannot be performed well; and
they have faith in Christ, without which it is impossible to please God.

These things are good and profitable unto men: which is to be understood
not of good works, though these are good in themselves, and profitable
to men in their effects; being done among them, and before them, they
set them an example of doing good likewise, when evil communications
corrupt good manners; and many of them issue in their temporal good,
profit, and advantage: but rather the doctrines of the Gospel are here
designed, which are before briefly treated of, and are said to be a
faithful saying; and which the apostle would have affirmed with,
certainty and constancy, in order to engage believers to the performance
of good works; and that for this reason, because these doctrines are
"good", excellent, valuable, and precious, comparable to gold, silver,
and precious stones: the author, matter, end, and use of them are good;
they come from God; they are concerning Jesus Christ, and his grace;
they contain good tidings of good things; and are exceeding useful to
influence faith, hope, love, and a cheerful obedience to the will of
God: they are profitable in the hands of the Spirit of God for
conviction, conversion, comfort, and edification; for the quickening and
enlightening of dead and dark sinners; for the reviving, establishing,
and building up of the saints; they are the wholesome words of Christ,
and are according to godliness, and are nourishing, when other doctrines
eat as a canker: and this sense is confirmed, not only by what goes
before, but by what follows after in the next verse; where insipid
notions and controversies are opposed unto them, as unprofitable and
vain.

[Titus 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">tit 3:9</span></span>

But avoid foolish questions,.... Such as were started in the schools of
the Jews; see [Ti2 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#023.md)

and genealogies; of their elders, Rabbins, and doctors, by whom their
traditions are handed down from one to another, in fixing which they
greatly laboured; see [Ti1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#004.md) and
contentions and strivings about the law; the rites and ceremonies of it,
and about the sense of it, and its various precepts, as litigated in the
schools of Hillell and Shammai, the one giving it one way, and the other
another; and what one declared to be free according to the law, the
other declared forbidden; which occasioned great contentions and
quarrels between the followers of the one, and of the other, as both the
Misna and Talmud show: and agreeably to this sense, the Syriac version
renders it, "the contentions and strifes of the scribes"; the Jewish
doctors, who were some on the side of Hillell, and others on the side of
Shammai; as well as went into parties and strifes among themselves, and
oftentimes about mere trifles; things of no manner of importance;
wherefore it follows,

for they are unprofitable and vain; empty things, of no manner of use,
to inform the judgment, improve the mind, or influence the life and
conversation.

[Titus 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">tit 3:10</span></span>

A man that is an heretic,.... An heretic, according to the notation of
the word, is either one that makes choice of an opinion upon his own
judgment, contrary to the generally received sense of the churches of
Christ, and prefers it to theirs, and obstinately persists in it;
separates from them, forms a party, and sets himself at the head of
them, whom he has drawn into the same way of thinking with himself: or
he is one that removes and takes away a fundamental doctrine of
Christianity, which affects particularly the doctrine of the Trinity,
the deity, and personality of Father, Son, and Spirit, and especially
the doctrines relating to the person, office, and grace of Christ; one
that brings in, or receives damnable doctrines; speaks or professes
perverse things, and draws away disciples after him; or is among such
disciples: for though schism and heresy do differ, and every schismatic
may not be an heretic, yet every heretic is a schismatic; he makes a
rent in the doctrine of Christ, and makes parties and divisions in his
church; and such are not always to be contended and disputed with, but
to be avoided and rejected:

after the first and second admonition reject; have nothing to do with
him; have no society with him; admit him not to private conversation;
and eject him from church communion, after he has been publicly
admonished twice by the order of the church; for this is not to be
understood of private admonition, by a particular person or persons; as
in the case of private offences, [Mat
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#015.md) but of public admonition, in the
name of the church. An admonition with the Jews did not continue less
than seven days (a); some say (b) thirty; that is, there were so many
days before it was out, or between one and another.

Knowing that he that is such is subverted,.... Or overturned and
demolished; he is like an edifice, that is not only decaying, and
falling, but is entirely everted, and pulled down; so that there is no
hopes of a restoration or recovery; he is in a desperate condition,
having opposed the person, or office, or sacrifice of Christ; having
either trodden the Son of God underfoot, or counted his blood common, or
done despite unto the spirit of grace; in either of which cases there is
no more sacrifice for sin:

and sinneth; not practically, but doctrinally, and wilfully after he has
received the knowledge of the truth; by denying the truth he received,
in which he continues, notwithstanding the evidence of the word of God
is against him; and; notwithstanding the arguments taken from it by the
ministers of the Gospel, to convince him; and notwithstanding the
admonitions of the church to recover him out of the snare of the devil:

being condemned of himself; not that an heretic is one that is convinced
in his own conscience that he is in an error, and that that is a truth
which he opposes; and yet he obstinately persists in the one, and
continues to set himself against the other; for then, none but an
hypocrite, that conceals his true sentiment, can be an heretic; nor can
any man be known to be one unless he accuses himself; since no man can
know the heart of another; and it would be impracticable in a church to
deal with heretics, or reject and excommunicate them: but either the
meaning is, that he is such an one, who by his own practice has
condemned himself; for whereas he has separated himself not only from
the faith of the church, but from the church itself; by so doing he
practically condemns himself, or judges himself unworthy of the
communion of the church, and so justifies the church in their rejection
and exclusion of him: or rather, an heretic is one who having professed
Christianity, and received the Scriptures as the only rule of faith and
practice, and still professes to abide by the same, and that all
doctrine is to be tried by them, and to be approved or condemned as that
agrees or disagrees with them, stands condemned by those Scriptures,
which he himself allows to be the rule of decision and determination;
and so may be said to be self-condemned.

When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus,.... These were both of
them ministers of the Gospel; there is no mention of Artemas anywhere
else; some say he was one of the seventy disciples, and that he was
afterwards bishop of Lystra; but these are uncertain things; See Gill on
[Luk 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001.md); the name is a contraction
of Artemidorus. Tychicus is often spoken of; and a very great character
is given of him by the apostle, in [Eph
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#021.md),

be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis; which was a city, not in
Epirus, but in Thrace, situated by the river Nessus, and had its name
from a victory obtained there: hither the apostle would have Titus come
to him, after one or other of the above ministers were come to Crete;
for as the apostle had the care of all the churches upon him, he would
not remove a minister from one place to another, without making a
provision in their room: his reasons for having Titus come to him, might
be either to know the state of the churches in Crete; or because he
stood in need of his assistance; or to send him elsewhere:

for I have determined there to winter; that is, to continue there all
the winter; not without labour, but to preach the Gospel, and administer
the ordinances to the saints there: and whereas he says "there"; this
shows that this epistle was not written from thence, as the subscription
asserts; for then he would have said "here", and not "there".

Bring Zenas the lawyer,.... Whether he was brought up to the civil law,
either among the Greeks or Romans, is not certain; it may be he was a
Jewish lawyer, or scribe, an interpreter of Moses's law among the Jews;
for with them a lawyer and a scribe were one and the same, as appears
from [Mat 22:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#035.md) compared with [Mar
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#028.md) and the Syriac version here
calls him "a scribe", and the Ethiopic version "a scribe of the city";
which looks as if it was a civil office he bore; but however, be he what
he will, he seems to have been now a preacher of the Gospel, being
joined with Apollos, who certainly was one: he is said to have been one
of the seventy disciples of Christ, and afterwards bishop of Diospolis;
See Gill on [Luk 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001.md); his name is the
contraction of Zenodorus: him the apostle would have Titus bring,

and Apollos, on their journey diligently; who was a Jew born at
Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the Scriptures; who had
preached at Corinth, but was now at Crete; and whom the apostle, with
Zenas, would have provided with everything necessary for their journey:

that nothing be wanting unto them; which might be proper for them in
their travels, to make them comfortable, and their journey pleasant and
easy.

And let ours also learn to maintain good works,.... By which are not
only meant honest trades, as some choose to render the words: it is
true, that a trade is a work; and an honest lawful employment of life is
a good work; and which ought to be maintained, attended to, and
followed, and to be learnt, in order to be followed. The Jews say, that
he that does not teach his son a trade, it is all one as if he taught
him to rob or steal; hence their doctors were brought up to trades; See
Gill on [Mar 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#003.md); as was the Apostle
Paul, though he had an education under Gamaliel: and such an one is to
be learned and maintained for necessary uses, for the good of a man's
self, and for the supply of his family; for the assistance of others
that are in need; for the support of the Gospel, and the interest of
Christ; and for the relief of poor saints; that such may not be
unfruitful and useless, in commonwealths, neighbourhoods, churches, and
families. The Jews say (c).

"there are four things which a man should constantly attend to with all
his might, and they are these; the law, "good works", prayer, , and "the
way of the earth", or "business"; if a tradesman, to his trade; if a
merchant, to his merchandise; if a man of war to war.''

But though this may be part of the sense of these words, it is not the
whole of it; nor are acts of beneficence to the poor of Christ, to the
household of faith, to strangers and ministers, to whom good is
especially to be done, only intended; though they, may be taken into the
account, in agreement with the context; but all good works in general,
which are done in conformity to the revealed will of God, in faith, from
a principle of love, and with a view to the glory of God, are meant: to
maintain them, is to endeavour to outdo others in them, not only the men
of the world, but one another; and to set examples of them to others,
and to provoke one another, by an holy emulation, to them; and to be
constant in the performance of them: and which believers may "learn"
partly from the Scriptures, which contain what is the good and perfect
will of God; these show what are good works, and direct unto them, and
furnish the man of God for them; and also the grace part of the
Scripture, the doctrines of the grace of God, teach to deny sin, and to
live sober, righteous, and godly lives; and from the examples of the
apostles and followers of Christ; and above all from Christ himself, the
great pattern and exemplar of good works: and this lesson of good works
is to be learnt by ours; meaning not only those of the same function,
who were in the same office, ministers of the Gospel, as were the
apostle and Titus; but all that believed in God, who were of the same
Christian community and society, professors of the same religion, and
partakers of the same grace; and were not only nominally, but really of
the same number, even of the number of God's elect, the redeemed from
among men, the family of Christ, sharers in the common faith, and heirs
of the grace of life; who lie under the greatest obligations to learn to
do good works: "for necessary uses"; not to make their peace with God,
or to atone for their sins, or to procure the pardon of them, or to
cleanse them from them, or for their justification before God, or to
obtain salvation and eternal life; but to glorify God, testify their
subjection to him, and gratitude for mercies received; to show forth
their faith to men; to adorn the doctrine of Christ, and a profession of
it; to recommend religion to others; to stop the mouths of gainsayers,
and put to silence the ignorance of foolish men: and "that they be not
unfruitful"; in them, and in the knowledge of Christ; good works are the
fruits of the Spirit, and of his grace; they are fruits of
righteousness; and such as are without them are like trees without
fruit, useless and unprofitable.

[Titus 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">tit 3:15</span></span>

All that are with me salute thee,.... All the apostles, fellow
labourers, and the ministers of the Gospel that were with him; and all
the members of the church where he was, sent their Christian salutation
to Titus; he being a person greatly esteemed, and whose praise was in
all the churches:

greet them that love us in the faith; not merely as men, as their
countrymen, as related to them in the flesh; or on account of any
external things, but as believers; because of the doctrine of faith,
professed and preached; and because of the grace of faith obtained and
possessed; or who love us faithfully, sincerely, and uprightly, from
their hearts, and not in word and tongue only:

grace be with you all, Amen; which is the common concluding salutation
in all Paul's epistles. This shows that this epistle was not designed
for Titus only, but for the saints at Crete.

It was written to Titus the first bishop of the church of the Cretians.
But this subscription, as many others, is not to be depended upon; it is
not very likely that Titus was bishop of this church at all; since his
stay there was but short, nor indeed elsewhere, seeing he was an
evangelist; though this is asserted both by Eusebius (d), and Sophronius
(e), who adds, that he died and was buried here: and what follows, that
it was written

from Nicopolis of Macedonia, does not seem to be just, as may be
concluded from [Tit 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#012.md). Many learned
men think it was written from Colosse, or some neighbouring place;
though when he wrote his epistle to the Colossians it looks as if he had
never been there before: the Syriac version adds, "sent by the hands of
Zenas and Apollos"; which is not unlikely, since he desires they might
be accommodated by Titus with what was necessary for the remaining part
of their journey, [Tit 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#013.md).
