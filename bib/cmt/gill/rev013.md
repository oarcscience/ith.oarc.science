INTRODUCTION TO REVELATION 13

This chapter contains a description of the Romish antichrist, under the
figure of two beasts, the one representing him in his civil power, the
other in his ecclesiastical power. The first beast is described by its
origin, the sea, and by the monstrous shape its several parts; its heads
seven, in which were the name of blasphemy; its horns ten, on which were
crowns; its skin like a leopard, its feet as a bear, and its mouth as a
lion; and by its state and condition, having power, a throne, and great
authority; and having one of its heads wounded, and healed; and by the
great regard had unto him, being wondered at, and worshipped by all the
world, and declared to be more powerful than any, and none to be like
them, [Rev 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001.md). Next an account is
given of what he was suffered to have, a blaspheming mouth, and power to
continue forty two months, [Rev 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#005.md);
and of what he said or uttered, his blasphemy against God, his name,
tabernacle, and the inhabitants of heaven, [Rev
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#006.md); and of what he did by
permission, made war with the saints, overcame them, and had power over
all people, [Rev 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#007.md); and of the
worship given him by the reprobate part of the world, [Rev
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#008.md); and the whole is concluded with
an exhortation exciting attention to what had been said, with a
threatening to the beast, and a word of comfort to the saints, [Rev
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#009.md). And then follows the description
of the second beast, by its original the earth; by its likeness to a
lamb, and a dragon; to the former for its two horns, and to the latter
for its speech, [Rev 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#011.md); and by the
actions ascribed to it, which are many; as exercising all the power of
the first beast; causing all the inhabitants of the earth to worship
that; doing miracles, of which one is mentioned, thereby deceiving the
men of the world; ordering them to make an image to the wounded beast;
giving life to it, so that it could speak; putting to death all that
refused to worship it; obliging men of all ranks and degrees to have a
mark in their right hands or foreheads, and forbidding such that had not
to buy or sell, [Rev 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#012.md). And the
chapter is concluded with an epiphonema, exciting men of understanding
to search out, and count the number of the beast's name, since it is
possible to be done, being the number of a man, and easy to be done,
consisting of three Greek letters, , which are numerically 666, [Rev
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#018.md).

[Revelation 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 13:1</span></span>

And I stood upon the sand of the sea,.... The Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and
Ethiopic versions read, "and he stood", &c. and so the Alexandrian copy;
meaning the dragon, said to be wroth with the woman, and to go forth to
make war with her seed, in the latter part of the preceding chapter,
where some versions place this clause; and the Arabic version reads
expressly, "and the serpent stood", &c. And this is thought by some to
be the better reading, because of the connection with what goes before,
and because there is no mention of the name of John, nor of his being
called or removed from heaven, where he was beholding sights, and
continuing the account of them, [Rev
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#001.md), as there is when he is shown
sights elsewhere; see [Rev 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#003.md). And
besides, as the dragon was contriving a new way of persecuting the
saints, and about to raise up a beast out of the sea, by which he might
do it, to whom he would give his power, seat, and authority, he is
represented as standing in a proper place for this purpose; it was upon
the sand, which may signify a multitude of people employed by him, and
also may denote the weakness and failure of his efforts in the issue;
yet the Greek copies in general agree in the common reading, and refer
it to John, who stood on the shore of the isle of Patmos, and in a fit
place, in a visionary way, to behold the following sight: for that the
next clause belongs to him is without doubt,

and saw a beast rise up out of the sea: by which is meant, not the
devil, because it is in [Rev 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#002.md),
distinguished from the dragon, who is the devil and Satan, as also
elsewhere, [Rev 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#013.md), nor the old
Roman empire, though there are many things which seem to agree; the
Roman monarchy is called a beast it is one of the four beasts in [Dan
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#002.md); which rose up out of the sea,
from a multitude of people and nations, which were gathered to it and
composed it. Rome Pagan had, as this beast has, seven heads and ten
horns, [Rev 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#003.md); and had power over
all nations, and is therefore sometimes called the whole world, and
exercised great cruelty upon the Christians; but then this is signified
by the red dragon itself, in the preceding chapter, and, besides, had
risen up before the times of John, whereas this is one of the things
shown him, which should be hereafter: this beast then was not, but was
to come, [Rev 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#001.md); and was not to
arise, nor did it arise till after the downfall of Rome Pagan, and after
the Arian persecution, after the woman's flight into the wilderness, and
after, and upon the inundation of the barbarous nations into the empire,
as appears from the preceding chapter; nor will the time of this beast's
duration agree with the old Roman empire, for this beast is to continue
forty two months, [Rev 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#005.md); which is
the whole time of the holy city being trodden under foot, and of the
church's being in the wilderness, and of the witnesses prophesying in
sackcloth; whereas the Roman monarchy, governed by emperors, did not
last four hundred years. Moreover, as this beast is distinguished from
the dragon, so it is said to have its power from him; whereas the Roman
empire was of God, and obedience and subjection to it are always
recommended to the saints in the Scriptures, [Rom
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#001.md), much less can the empire, as
become truly Christian, be intended; nor are either the eastern or the
Turkish empires designed, for neither of these had their seat at Rome,
which the dragon save to this beast, but at Constantinople: it remains
then, that by it meant the Roman empire, when divided into ten kingdoms,
and united in the Papacy; or it designs Christ in his secular power,
with the ten kings, that receive power with him as such one hour, and
give their kingdom to him: now this beast is said to "rise up out of the
sea"; either out of the abyss, the bottomless pit of hell, see [Rev
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#007.md); or out of the sea of this world,
and the wicked in it, who are like a troubled sea that cannot rest; or
out of the floods of errors and heresies, by which this man of sin was
conceived and cherished, and a way was paved for his open rising and
appearance in the world; or rather, since waters design, in this book,
nations, people, and tongues, see [Rev
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#015.md); and the four beasts in Daniel
are said to rise out of the sea, [Rev
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#002.md); and a multitude of people are
compared to the waves of the sea, [Eze
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#003.md); see also [Isa
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#012.md), where the Jewish writers say
(b), the nations are compared to the sea, as Israel to the sand, the
inundation of the barbarous nations, the Goths, Huns, and Vandals, into
the empire, seem to be intended, which made great commotions and changes
in it: these set up ten kingdoms in it, upon which antichrist arose, and
placed himself at the head of them; these gave their kingdoms to the
beast; and so may be said to give rise unto him, especially as to his
secular power.

Having seven heads: which some understand the seat of knowledge, and
seven a number of perfection; and so may refer to those boasted
treasures of wisdom and knowledge which antichrist pretends to have, as
being the judge of controversies, and the infallible interpreter of the
Scriptures; or else the seven fold form of government among the Romans
is intended, as in [Rev 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#003.md); or
rather as it is interpreted in [Rev
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#009.md); the seven mountains on which
Rome was built, and so design the city itself built on them, that being
the metropolis of the empire; or the seven capital cities of the empire,
as Mr. Daubuz thinks; the whole is meant, for it is the same Roman
monarchy as before, only in a different form:

and ten horns; the ten kingdoms, into which the empire was divide it
upon its being wasted and vanquished by the Goths, and the ten kings of
them, which reigned with the beast, and gave their kingdoms to him; so
horns signify kingdoms in [Zac 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#018.md).

And upon his horns ten crowns; which distinguishes Rome Papal from Rome
Pagan; the crowns in Rome Pagan were upon the heads, or the emperors,
that resided at Rome; and though it had ten horns, as here, and was
divided into so many provinces, which were governed by deputies,
proconsuls, &c. yet they were not kings, they had no crowns; but here
the horns have crowns on them because the governors of these ten
kingdoms are crowned kings:

and upon his heads the name of blasphemy; which refers not to Rome Pagan
being called the eternal city, and Rome the goddess, and the like; but
to Rome Papal, or antichrist, who elsewhere is said to have the name
"Mystery" written upon the forehead, and to have blasphemy on his heads;
and is called blasphemy in the abstract, as being a most blasphemous
creature against God, Christ, and his people, and so his name is
suitable to his character, mouth, and language, [Rev
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#005.md); assuming that to himself which
only belongs to God and Christ, as power over the conscience, to forgive
sin, &c. and even deity itself; see [Th2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#004.md). The Alexandrian copy, and some
others, the Complutensian edition, the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic
versions, read, "names of blasphemy".

[Revelation 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 13:2</span></span>

And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard,.... To which the
Grecian kingdom is compared in [Dan
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#006.md); because of that rapidity and
swiftness with which Alexander overran the world, and set up this
monarchy; and to which the Roman Papal monarchy bears some resemblance;
for as the Grecian monarchy was divided into several parts, which the
leopard's spots may also point out, so the Roman empire was divided into
ten parts, and united under the pope, as the head of them; and may be,
in this form, compared to a leopard for its swiftness, [Hab
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#008.md); because this beast, as soon as he
arose and got power, quickly, and in a very short time, extended it over
all emperors, kings, princes, bishops, and over all kingdoms and
churches; and for its spots, [Jer
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#023.md), which may be expressive both of
the spots of sin and immorality of every kind, and of errors and
heresies, superstition and idolatry, with which antichrist and his
followers abound; and for its insidiousness and cruelty, [Jer
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#006.md). It lies in wait for its prey, and
suddenly falls upon it, and devours it; and is a lively picture of the
cunning sleight of the antichristian party, who lie in wait to deceive,
and of their blood thirstiness and barbarity. It is reported (c) of the
leopard, that it is of a sweet smell, and by its odour it draws the
fawns, does, &c. near it, and then makes a prey of them; so antichrist,
by outward riches and preferments, by the external pomp and splendour of
his religion, by his living wonders and miracles, and by his great
pretensions to holiness and the like, allures multitudes unto him, and
destroys them.

And his feet were as the feet of a bear; to which the Persian monarchy
is compared, [Dan 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#005.md). And this, as
some think, may denote the strength and stability of the kingdom of
antichrist, it having already endured a great while, and will be thought
to be very firm and stable when its ruin is near; or rather the wars and
fightings of antichrist against the saints, the fore feet of the bear
being what that creature lights with, and tears and destroys such as
oppose it, or fall a prey to it; and may also, as before, express the
voraciousness and cruelty of antichrist, with respect to the bodies and
souls of men:

and his mouth, as the mouth of a lion: to which creature the Babylonian
monarchy is compared, [Dan 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#004.md),
uttering out blasphemies against God, threatening ruin and destruction
to men, and injecting fear into them, as the roaring of a lion does, and
seizing upon, and devouring their estates and possessions, as well as
butchering their persons. This beast has all the properties of the
several beasts in Daniel's prophecy, wherefore all the figures there
made use of to describe them are put together, to point unto us this
monster of iniquity.

And the dragon gave him his power: for the coming of antichrist is after
the working of Satan, [Th2 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#009.md); he
gave him his cunning and subtlety, as the old serpent, and taught him
his arts and tricks to deceive mankind; and gave him a power to do signs
and lying wonders, as well as communicated his malice and cruelty to
persecute and oppress the saints; or an "army" of ecclesiastics to fight
under him, and for him:

and his seat; at Rome, for there Satan's seat was, [Rev
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#013.md), in the time of the Pagan Roman
empire, which was quitted by Dioclesian and Maximian, when they resigned
the government of it, the one being at Nicomedia, and the other at
Milan; and when Constantine came to the throne, he removed to Byzantium,
and rebuilt it, and called it after his name Constantinople, and had his
residence there, as had all the eastern emperors afterwards; and as for
the western emperors, they chiefly resided either at Milan or Ravenna,
to which last place Odoacer, Theodoric, and other Gothic kings retired,
when the government was in their hands; so that hereby this seat was
empty, and way was made for antichrist to take it, as he did.

And great authority; over the Roman empire, and the kings and kingdoms
in it; he gave him his authority as the god of this world; what Christ
refused at the hands of Satan, that his pretended vicar took, even the
kingdoms of this world, and the glory of them; yea, assumed to himself
all power in heaven, earth, and hell, signified by his triple crown, at
the instigation of the devil; so that it appears that he is not the
vicar of Christ, but the vicar of the devil; and not the successor of
Peter, but the successor of Satan; and that he holds his possessions,
not by the donation of Constantine, but by the gift of the dragon.

[Revelation 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 13:3</span></span>

And I saw one of his heads,.... Not the Capitoline mountain, or the
Capitol, the temple of Jupiter, built on that hill, which was burnt by
lightning in the times of Titus, and magnificently rebuilt by Domitian,
which was a thing past, and of no such moment as to be taken notice of
here; nor anyone of the Roman emperors particularly, as Julius Caesar,
at whose death the empire received a wound, upon its first erection in
him, but was healed by the settlement of Augustus in it; nor Nero, at
whose death the family of the Caesars ceased, when the empire was
threatened with ruin in the following reigns, but was restored and
reestablished in Vespasian, for these were before the times of John: but
this is to be understood of the sixth head, or form of government, which
obtained in the empire; namely, that of emperors, and of the destruction
of Rome itself, the head of the empire, and which was built on seven
mountains, designed by the seven heads of this beast: and this head was

as it were wounded to death; when the Roman empire was like a burning
mountain cast into the sea; when Rome itself was taken, sacked, and
burnt, more than once, particularly by Totilas; when Augustulus, the
last of the emperors, was obliged to abdicate the throne; when Odoacer
called himself, not emperor of Rome, but king of Italy, and retired from
Rome to Ravenna; and when Adolphus, another Gothic king, thought to have
changed the name of Rome, and given it that of Gothia: this seemed to be
a deadly wound to Rome, to the empire and emperors.

And his deadly wound was healed; by the setting up of ten kingdoms in
it, the kings of which gave them to the beast, to antichrist, the pope
of Rome, and so the empire came to have an head again, a governor,
though of another kind: some choose to understand this of the wound
which antichrist received at the Reformation, by Luther, Calvin, and
others, which has since been healing, Popery recovering itself again in
some countries where it was driven out, and which, it is thought, will
be entirely healed before his destruction:

and all the world wondered after the beast; which expresses the large
extent of antichrist's dominion, which reached to all the Roman empire,
[Luk 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001.md); yea, to all kindreds,
tongues, and nations, [Rev 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#007.md); so
that the universality the Papists boast of, as a note of the true
church, is manifestly a mark of the beast, or of antichrist; and also
the great esteem he is had in by his followers, who admire his power and
authority, his grandeur, pomp, and riches, his signs and lying wonders,
his pretended infallibility and holiness, his stock of merits and
unwritten traditions, his skill to interpret Scripture, and his power to
forgive sins, and the like: they went after him, obeyed him, embraced
his doctrines, attended his religion and worship with wonder and
amazement.

[Revelation 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 13:4</span></span>

And they worshipped the dragon,.... The devil, in the idols, images,
angels, and saints departed, to whom they give adoration, as did the
Gentiles, whose successors they are, and whose name they bear; see [Co1
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#020.md);

which gave power unto the beast, as in [Rev
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#002.md);

and they worshipped the beast; not only in a civil way, being subject to
him as their temporal lord, to whom they give homage; obedience, and
tribute, but in a religious way; for antichrist sits in the temple to be
worshipped as God, showing himself that he is God, and receives
adorations from his creatures, the cardinals, and others; but woe to
them that worship this beast; see [Rev
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#009.md).

Saying, who is like unto the beast? using such expressions as are used
of God himself, implying that there is none like him, [Exo
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#011.md), yea, they ascribe deity to him,
calling him our Lord God the pope, God, and a God on earth; See Gill on
[Th2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004.md).

Who is able to make war with him? And indeed, such was his power and
strength once, that he was more than a match for emperors and kings; and
those were badly off that engaged in a war with him, when his power was
such, that he could depose one, and set up other, kick the crowns of
kings, tread upon the necks of emperors, oblige them to hold his
stirrup, while mounted his horse, and keep them barefoot at his gate for
days together, waiting for admittance; of all which there are instances.

[Revelation 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 13:5</span></span>

And there was given unto him a mouth,.... The beast is said to have a
mouth before, like the mouth of a lion, [Rev
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#002.md); but now he was moved and stirred
up by the dragon, the devil, to open it, not only in a cruel and
voracious way, but in a haughty, lying, and blasphemous manner: and this
was given him, it was at the instigation of Satan, and by divine
permission; his coming, speaking, and acting, were after the working of
Satan, but not without the will of God; who, as he gave up many to a
judicial blindness, to believe his lies and blasphemies, gave up him to
speak them, as follows:

speaking great things, and blasphemies; great swelling words of vanity;
calling himself by high and lofty titles, as Christ's vicar, Peter's
successor, head of the church, universal bishop, &c. promising great
things to his followers, riches, honours, pleasures, pardons, and heaven
itself; and uttering things of a blasphemous kind, or great blasphemies,
the particulars of which are mentioned in [Rev
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#006.md); so the little horn, who is the
same with the Romish antichrist, is said to have a mouth speaking great
things, very great things, and his look more stout than his fellows,
[Dan 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008.md).

And power was given unto him to continue forty and two months; to
continue in being, or to continue blaspheming and speaking great things;
and indeed, as long as he continues, he will continue blaspheming; as
soon as he arose he had a name of blasphemy on his heads, and his mouth
was immediately opened in blasphemy, and so it continues, and will to
the end of this date. The Ethiopic version reads it, "and power was
given to him to do signs, whatsoever he would"; miracles, lying signs
and wonders; see [Rev 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#013.md). Some
copies read, and so the Arabic version, "and power was given him to make
war"; but he did not make war as soon as he arose, and so not all the
time that is here allotted him; and the word "war" seems to be
transcribed from [Rev 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#007.md). The phrase
rather intends his being, and the continuance and duration of it; which
is the same period of time in which the holy city is trodden under foot
by this beast, and the same with the 1260 days or years, in which the
witnesses prophesy in sackcloth, and the woman, the church, is in the
wilderness, [Rev 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#002.md); for forty two
months, reckoning thirty days to a month, as the eastern people did,
make just 1260 days, for these things are all contemporary: hence it
appears, that 1260 prophetic days, that is, years, contain the whole
period of antichrist's reign and continuance; so that could we tell
where they began, it might be exactly known when his reign will end; but
for want of knowing the former, the best of calculators have failed in
the latter: but seeing the time when he was made universal bishop by
Phocas bids fair for the time of his open appearance, and the beginning
of his reign, and of his blasphemy, which was in the year 859, to which,
if we add 1260, the expiration of his reign will fall in the year 1866;
so that he may have upwards of an hundred and twenty years yet to
continue; but of this we cannot be certain; however, the conjecture is
not improbable.

[Revelation 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 13:6</span></span>

And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God,.... By sitting as God
in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God; by suffering
himself to be called by the name of God, God on earth, Lord God the
pope, and to be worshipped as God; and by assuming infallibility, giving
out that he cannot err, which only belongs to the God of truth; and by
his idolatrous practices commanded by him, as the worshipping of idols
of gold, silver, wood, and stone, which is in Scripture called
blaspheming God, [Isa 65:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#007.md); see [Dan
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036.md).

To blaspheme his name; his authority, by arrogating to himself all power
in heaven, earth, and hell; by taking upon him to bind and loose the
consciences of men, and to dispense with the laws of God, and make them
void by his own traditions; and to dispose of the kingdoms of this
world, by removing kings, and setting up kings at pleasure, which is the
prerogative of the King of kings; and by pretending; to forgive sin,
which none but God can do; and by granting indulgences, pardons, &c.
Moreover, by the name of God may be meant the Scriptures, which are the
means by which God reveals and makes known himself; and these the man of
sin blasphemes, by making them a nose of wax, by imposing on them what
senses he pleases; by assuming a right of being the sole interpreter of
them, and the judge of all controversies; and by setting up his own
unwritten traditions upon an equal foot with them, and above them, and
by denying the common people the use of them, in their own language; and
particularly the Gospel, which is sometimes called the name of the Lord,
[Act 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#015.md), may be intended, which is
sadly blasphemed, and evil spoken of by antichrist; as the doctrines of
justification by Christ's righteousness, of peace and pardon by his
blood, and atonement by his sacrifice, through the antichristian notions
of merit, works of supererogation, pardons, penance, purgatory, and the
like:

and his tabernacle; meaning either the human nature of Christ, which God
pitched, and not man, the temple of his body, in which the Godhead
dwells bodily, and where the eternal Word dwelt, or tabernacled among
men; this is blasphemed by pretending to transubstantiate, the bread and
wine in the supper of the Lord into the very body and blood of Christ,
and to offer him up again in the sacrifice of the Mass, every time that
blasphemous piece of service is performed: or else the church of God,
which is the temple of the living God, where he chooses, desires, and
delights to dwell; this is blasphemed by antichrist, by sitting in it as
if he was God; asserting himself to be the head of the church which
solely belongs to Christ; taking upon him to coin new doctrines, and
make new laws and orders, and impose them on it, and to change and alter
the ordinances and discipline of it as he pleases; and by persecuting
and destroying all such who will not submit to his decrees and
prescripts: or else heaven itself, the habitation of God, and where his
throne is, may be designed, which the pope blasphemously affirms to have
the keys of; and that he can open and shut it, let persons into it, or
exclude front it, at pleasure; and that he can dispose of it, and sell
it for money, and make and canonize new saints in it, as often as he
thinks fit.

And them that dwell in heaven; either saints below, members of a Gospel
church, who are born from above, are partakers of the heavenly calling,
and whose conversation is in heaven, who are by antichrist stigmatized
and persecuted as schismatics and heretics; or rather angels and saints
departed, who are in heaven, and dwell there, and who are worshipped and
prayed to as Mediators and intercessors, whose names are used in a very
ridiculous and blasphemous manner, to their great dishonour and
reproach, as well as to the injury of Christ, the only Mediator between
God and men.

[Revelation 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 13:7</span></span>

And it was given unto him to make war with the saints,.... The remnant
of the woman's seed, [Rev 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#017.md), whom
God has set apart for himself, Christ has cleansed from sin by his
blood, and the Holy Spirit has sanctified by his grace; and who under
the influence of it live holy lives and conversations; against such
Satan always bore an enmity; and it is an aggravation of the wickedness
of the Romish antichrist, that he makes war with such, which he is
stirred up to by Satan, with a malicious intent, and is permitted by God
for the trial of the faith and patience of his people: this war of
antichrist, with the saints, may be understood not merely spiritually,
of his anathemas, excommunications, bulls, and the like, but literally,
of his drawing the temporal sword against them; see [Rev
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#010.md); and bringing of armies against
them, and fighting pitched battles; and it is thought there may be a
special regard had to his war with the Waldenses and Albigenses, in
which war it is said that a million were slain; and may take in all his
ways and methods of destroying the saints, by the bloody Inquisition,
murders, massacres, and punishments of all sorts; and also his last war
with the two witnesses, in which they will be slain, which is yet to
come, [Rev 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#007.md);

and to overcome them: not so as to submit to him, and to forsake the
doctrines and ordinances of Christ, but by killing them; and who, by
dying in the faith and cause of Christ, overcome Satan, get the victory
over the world, and antichrist, and are more than conquerors through him
that has loved them.

And power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations; in
the Roman empire, which wondered after him, and worshipped him, and over
whom he has reigned, and has exercised both a temporal and spiritual
jurisdiction; see [Rev 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#015.md).

[Revelation 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 13:8</span></span>

And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him,.... The inhabitants
of the Roman empire, the idolatrous part of it, the men of the world,
earthly minded men; who are as they came into the world, and are of the
earth, earthly, and seek only after earthly honours, pleasures, and
profits; these are the admirers and adorers of the beast:

whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from
the foundation of the world; by which book is meant God's predestination
of men to eternal life, or his decree of election; why this is called
the "book of life"; see Gill on [Rev
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#005.md); and their "names being written
therein from the foundation of the world", [Rev
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#008.md), for such a construction the
words will bear, denotes that election is eternal, and is not an act of
time, nor dependent upon anything done in time; and that it is of
particular persons, and not of bodies of men, of nations and churches,
and still less of propositions, or of persons so and so qualified, or
under such conditions and circumstances; and that it is perfectly well
known to God, and is sure and certain in its effects, and is
unchangeable and irrevocable; for what is written in it, is written, and
will always stand, not upon the foot of works, but of the sovereign
grace of God; and this is called the Lamb's book; that is, Christ, who
is compared to a Lamb for its harmlessness, meekness, and patience, and
was typified by the lambs in the legal sacrifices; and this book is
called his, because he was present at the making of it, and was
concerned in putting down the names in it, [Joh
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#018.md), and he himself stands first in
it as the elect of God, and the head of all the elect, who, as members,
were chosen in him: the act of election was made in him, and stands sure
in him; and he is the author and giver of that life, which men are
chosen unto both here and hereafter: and he may be said to be "slain
from the foundation of the world"; in the decree and purpose of God, by
which he was set forth, or foreappointed to be the propitiation for sin,
and was foreordained, before the foundation of the world, to redeem his
people by his blood, and in the promise of God immediately after the
fall of man, that the seed of the woman should have his heel bruised,
and he himself should bruise the serpent's head, which made it as sure
as if it was then done; and in the sacrifices, which were immediately
upon this offered up, and were types of the death and sacrifice of
Christ; and in the faith of the saints, which brings distant things
near, and considers them as if present; and also in his members, in
Abel, and others, in whom he suffered, as he still does in his people;
to which may be added, that such is the efficacy of the bloodshed and
death of Christ, that it reached to all the saints from the beginning of
the world, for the justification of their persons, the atonement of
their sins, and cleansing from them; for the remission of sins, that are
past, and for the redemption of transgressions under the first
testament; for Old Testament saints from the beginning are saved by the
grace of the Lord Jesus, as New Testament ones are. Something like this
the Jews say (e) of the Messiah upon [Gen
49:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#011.md),

"he washed , "from the day that the world was created"; who is he? this
is the King Messiah.--It is written [Gen
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002.md); "and the Spirit of God", &c. This
is the Spirit of the King Messiah; and from the day that the world was
created; he washed his garments in wine;''

which the Jewish writers (f) understand of blood, which for its redness
is like to wine; though they interpret it of the blood of the slain,
with which the garments of the Messiah will be stained. Now such whose
names are not written in this book of the Lamb, who have no interest in
electing grace, nor in redemption by Christ, the slain Lamb of God, nor
any right unto eternal life, who are reprobate persons, vessels of wrath
fitted for destruction, who are foreordained to condemnation, and are
given up to believe a lie, that they might be damned, these are the
followers and worshippers of antichrist.

If any man have an ear, let him hear. And diligently attend to this
mystical description of antichrist, as being matter of some difficulty
to understand, as well as of great moment and importance, and seriously
consider it, that he may know him, and his followers, and avoid them;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 13:10</span></span>

He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity,.... As the
devil, by whom men are led captive at his will, and the Romish
antichrist, who leads multitudes of souls to hell; these shall be taken
and cast into the lake which burns with fire and brimstone. The Jews (g)
have a saying, that

"captivity comes into the world for idolatry, uncleanness, and murder;''

which three things are notorious in the Romish antichrist: and in the
same treatise they say (h), that the sword, the next judgment mentioned,
comes into the world for delay of justice, and the perversion of it.

He that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword; the design
of the phrase is to show, that there will be a just retaliation made to
the antichristian beast, for all his cruelty to the saints, and the
murders of them; and that because he has shed much blood of the saints,
blood shall be given him to drink, and he shall be used in like manner
he has used others; see [Gen 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#006.md) [Mat
26:52](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#052.md).

Here is the patience and the faith of the saints; meaning either that
hereby, through the cruelties and barbarities of the Romish antichrist,
the patience and faith of the saints are tried; and that they have great
need of them, and of the exercise of them, under such usages; and that
these being tried, and continue, will receive much commendation, honour,
and praise; or else the sense is, that it requires both faith and
patience in the saints, to believe that antichrist will be thus
destroyed, and to wait quietly till the time comes. The Arabic version
reads, "here is the patience and prayers of the saints": who cry, how
long will it be ere our blood is avenged? and have need of patience to
rest a while, till their prayers are answered.

[Revelation 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 13:11</span></span>

And I beheld another beast,.... The same with the first, only in another
form; the same for being and person, but under a different
consideration; the same antichrist, but appearing in another light and
view: the first beast is the pope of Rome, at the head of the ten
kingdoms, of which the Roman empire consisted; this other beast is the
same pope of Rome, with his clergy, cardinals, archbishops, bishops,
priests, &c. before he is described as a temporal monarch, now as a
spiritual lord; there he is represented in his secular character, as
having the seat, power, and authority of the dragon, of Rome Pagan,
engaging the attention and wonder of the whole world, and striking
terror into them, and as making war with the saints, and ruling over all
nations and tongues; here in his ecclesiastic character, pretending
great humility and holiness, showing signs and lying wonders, obliging
to idolatry, and exercising tyranny and cruelty on all that will not
profess his religion: that this is the same beast with the first in
substance, though not in show, appears from his exercising the same
power, causing all to worship the first beast, or himself as a temporal
lord, by which he is supported in his spiritual dignity; and by mention
being made only of one beast, at the close of this account, and of his
mark, name, and number being but one; nor is there any other but one
hereafter spoken, of in this book, either as ruling, or as conquered,
and as taken, and as going into perdition, and as cast into the lake:
this beast is described by his original,

coming up out of the earth; either from under it, out of the bottomless
pit, from hell; or out of, a low condition, a poor crawling earthworm;
the extracts of many of the popes, cardinals, and religious orders, have
been very mean: or this may represent the secret and private manner, and
slow degrees by which this monster of iniquity rose; as things gradually
rise up out of the earth unobserved; this man of sin was springing up in
the apostles' time, and by degrees rose up to the power and authority he
is here said to have: or rather, as this beast, in his other form, rose
up out of the sea, out of the commotions raised in the empire by the
barbarous nations, by whom he was lifted up to his imperial dignity; so
he is described in this form, and is represented as rising up out of the
earth, out of the earthly part of the church, or out of the apostasy
which the visible church was sunk into, through the outward riches and
honours bestowed on it by the Christian emperors, which made way for the
rising of this beast; and this shows the nature of his kingdom, which is
worldly and earthly, and so truly antichristian, being diametrically
opposite to the kingdom of Christ, which is not of this world:

and he had two horns like a lamb; or "like to the Lamb"; the Lord Jesus
Christ, the Lamb of God; though he has seven horns, denoting fulness of
power, this but two; he stands on Mount Zion, with the 144,000, having
his Father's name on their foreheads, this upon the earth, with his
followers, having his own mark and name upon them. The Ethiopic version
renders it, "and he had two horns, and he seemed as a lamb"; he affected
a lamb like disposition, pretended to great humility and meekness,
calling himself "servus servorum", the servant of servants, to cover his
pride, ambition, and tyranny; and would be thought to be a lamb without
spot and blemish, ascribing to himself infallibility, and suffering
himself to be called his Holiness, when he is the man of sin, and
mystery of iniquity: by his "two horns" some understand his two fold
power, secular and ecclesiastic; but as these are separately represented
by two beasts, rather these two horns intend the two parts of the
empire, eastern and western, into which it was divided, when this beast
arose, and by which the Papacy was raised to its power, had supported in
it; and the two supreme pontiffs, the bishop of Rome, and the bishop of
Constantinople; or else the beast's power of binding and loosing, of
dispensing with the laws of God, and of imposing his own laws on the
consciences of men.

And he spake as a dragon; like the devil himself, affirming as he did,
[Luk 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#006.md); that the power of disposing
of the kingdoms of this world, and the glory of them, was delivered to
him, and he could give it to whom he would: he spake arrogantly, as if
he was above all that is called God, and as if he was God himself; and
he spake like a dragon cruelly, like the great red dragon, like the
devil, who was a murderer from the beginning, breathing out slaughter,
and threatenings against the saints, as Rome Pagan; and he spake lies in
hypocrisy, blasphemies, idolatries, and doctrines of devils.

[Revelation 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 13:12</span></span>

And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him,....
Sitting in the same seat, having the same power and authority from the
dragon, making war with the saints by preaching and writing against
them, by anathemas, excommunications, and bulls, and so overcame and
silenced them, or delivered them over to the secular arm to be put to
death, ruling over the consciences of men in a tyrannical way, in all
nations, kindreds, and tongues, in the empire; and all this before, in
the presence, and under the influence of the secular power, of the
Papacy, signified by the first beast, and with his good liking, and for
his credit and support:

and causeth the earth, and them that dwell therein; the Roman empire,
and the inhabitants of it, especially the carnal and earthly part of
them:

to worship the first beast; to be subject to the temporal power of the
Papacy, or to submit to the pope as a temporal lord, to give homage and
tribute to him, and the like, in order to support his worldly power and
grandeur; and this was caused or brought about by his emissaries, his
spiritual vassals, his legates, cardinals, priests, &c. by their
exhortations, persuasions, and commands, delivered both in writing and
preaching:

whose deadly wound was healed; which deadly wound was given the Roman
empire under its sixth head, the emperors, when they ceased, and was
healed by the pope, the seventh head, being set as a temporal monarch
over the ten kingdoms in it.

[Revelation 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 13:13</span></span>

And he doeth great wonders,.... Or miracles; not real, but pretended
ones, lying wonders, which the Popish legends are full of the accounts
of, as done by the priests, or by this or the other saint:

so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight
of men; in imitation of Elijah, [Kg2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#009.md); and this single instance is put
instead of all others, it being usual with the Jews to express all
wonderful and miraculous operations by this miracle of Elijah's: and
this may be understood mystically, of the pretensions of the Papacy to
confer the Holy Ghost, and his gifts upon men, by breathing on them,
which on the day of Pentecost were represented by cloven tongues, as of
fire, coming down from heaven; or of their anathemas, curses, and
excommunications, at which time burning torches and candles are cast up,
and fall down, as emblems of divine wrath, which is called cursing men
with bell, book, and candle; or else of the fire of persecution: "from
heaven"; the secular powers of the empire: "upon the earth"; the common
people: or this may be understood literally; so they tell us, that Pope
Zachary, once on a journey to Ravenna, had in the daytime a cloud to
protect him from the heat, and in the night time armies of fire appeared
in the clouds to go before him; and as Pope Innocent was at Mass, a
golden crown was seen, and on it a dove, and under it a smoking censer,
and hard by them two burning firebrands: and it is reported of Pope
Hildebrand, that, whenever he pleased, he could shake his sleeves, and
sparks of fire would come out; and by these miracles deluded the eyes of
the simple with a show of holiness, which, with other instances, are
taken notice of by Napier, Brightman, and other writers: and so here
this is said to be done "in the sight of men"; to their apprehension,
seemingly, in their view; they being cheated and deluded with an
appearance and show of things which were not real.

[Revelation 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 13:14</span></span>

And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth,.... The Complutensian
edition, and two of Stephens's copies, read "mine", instead of "them";
creatures of God, and professors of Christ, carnal and unregenerate men;
not the elect of God, and true believers in Christ, these cannot be
deceived by the signs and wonders of false Christs and false prophets;
antichrist's deceivableness of unrighteousness only operates in them
that perish:

by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of
the beast; the secular power of the Papacy encouraging, confirming, and
giving a sanction to those lying miracles, and obliging all to believe
them, and come into the things, doctrines, or practices, they are
designed to promote:

saying to them that dwell on the earth: the apostate church, or the
carnal inhabitants of the empire: ordering and commanding them

that they should make an image to the beast which had the wound by a
sword, and did live; meaning the Roman empire, which had received a
deadly wound in its sixth head, the emperors, by the sword of the Goths,
Huns, &c. but now revived in its seventh head, the pope of Rome, to whom
the ten kings gave their kingdoms: the image made to this beast some
understand of the translation of the empire to Charles the great, and
his successors the emperors, by the pope of Rome, he ordaining so many
electors to chose a king of the Romans, and elect an emperor when one
was wanting; and this was an image to the first beast, a shadow, an
appearance of the Roman empire, and but a shadow; for the power of
inaugurating and crowning these emperors, and of setting up and deposing
them when the pope pleased, lie reserved to himself: but rather this
designs the image worship, or the worshipping of idols of gold and
silver, of wood and stone, which he caused the inhabitants of the earth
to make, and give adoration to; or else the whole Papal religion, and
the Papacy itself, for the beast, and the image of the beast, are all
along in this book afterwards mentioned together as being the same, [Rev
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#009.md), which is an image of the Gentile
religion, in their high priest, priests, temples, idols, offerings,
garments, worshipping of angels, and saints departed, with a numerous
train of rites and ceremonies, borrowed from the old Pagan religion;
hence the Papists are called Gentiles, [Rev
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#002.md), the Roman empire, represented by
these two beasts, and this image, had now one head, the pope, as before
an emperor, and a religion in it much resembling its ancient one; but,
before that was set up, this image was in being.

[Revelation 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rev 13:15</span></span>

And he had power to give life unto the image of the

beast,.... Or "breath"; he breathed into it, and animated it; he gave
this new religion a sanction, he confirmed and established it, and
obliged all in his dominions to embrace and acknowledge it; and this he
did by his decrees and canons, and those that refused were delivered
over to the secular power, which he also exercised under another
consideration:

that the image of the beast should both speak: so that it was not like
Nebuchadnezzar's golden image that he set up, which required another to
speak for it and demand adoration to it; and should seem to be
preferable to the dumb idols of the Gentiles, which have mouths, but
speak not; and may be understood either of the images of the virgin
Mary, and other saints, which it is pretended, and the people are made
to believe, that they do at times actually speak, and really weep and
laugh, as it may serve their different purposes; or this image may be
said to speak by the decrees, canons, anathemas, curses, threatenings,
persuasions, doctrines, and blasphemies of the pope and his clergy; so
that this image is like both the first and second beast; it has a mouth
speaking blasphemies, as the first, and it speaks like a dragon, as the
second;

and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast
should be killed: which, according to the generality of copies, refers
to the image itself, that that has a power from the beast as to speak,
so to put to death those that refuse to worship it; but the
Complutensian edition reads , "and causes": that is, the beast causes,
or orders all those that will not worship the image, to be killed; that
is, that as many as will not embrace and profess the Popish religion
shall be put to death; and these are the known orders and decrees of the
Papacy, which have been executed by the Inquisition, and other hands, in
innumerable instances; the blood of all the saints and prophets is found
in Rome Papal, and will be avenged; these are the martyrs of Jesus, with
whose blood the whore on the scarlet coloured beast has been made drunk;
and this sense is confirmed by the eastern versions.

[Revelation 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rev 13:16</span></span>

And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor,

free and bond,.... Men of all ranks and degrees, states and conditions,
within his jurisdiction; this refers to the beast, and not to the image:

to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads; or "that
they might give themselves marks", as the Complutensian edition reads;
which is an allusion either to the custom among the Romans of imprinting
marks upon their servants and soldiers, by which they might be known to
whom they belonged; servants had them in their foreheads (i), and
soldiers in their hands (k); or to the usages of the Jews in binding
their phylacteries upon their arms and foreheads, to put them in mind of
the law of God, and their obedience to it; or to the practices of the
Heathens, in putting the mark of the god they worshipped upon their
bodies; Maimonides (l) says, it was a custom with the Gentiles to mark
themselves with their idols, showing that they were their bought
servants, and were marked for their service: the sense is, that some
received the mark in one place, and some in another: those who were
obliged to receive the mark in the right hand seem to be the clergy,
such who entered into holy orders; who lifted up their right hand, and
swore and vowed allegiance to the pope, and testified they were ready to
defend and support his religion and interest; and who in their
ordination are said to have an indelible character impressed on them:
and those who received the mark in their foreheads are the common people
in general, who one and all have the same impress upon them; which may
intend either the sign of the cross in baptism, or rather their open
confession of the Popish religion, which they as publicly avow and
declare as if it had been written on their foreheads.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rev 13:17</span></span>

And that no man might buy or sell,.... Either in an ecclesiastical
sense, as to, be in any church office, or perform any such service, to
say Mass, hear confession, give absolution, sell pardons and
indulgences, &c. or in a civil sense, as to trade, and exercise
merchandise, and this was forbidden by several Popish councils and
synods; the Lateran council, under Pope Alexander, decreed against the
Waldenses and Albigenses, that no one should presume to retain or
encourage them in their houses or countries, or "trade" with them; and
the synod of Tours in France forbid any reception of heretics, or
protection, and that any communion should be had with them "in buying
and selling", as Mr. Mede has observed; and it was ordered by a bull of
Pope Martin the Fifth, that no contract should be made with such, and
that they should not follow any business and merchandise:

save he that had the mark; took the oath to be true to the pope, or made
a public profession of the Popish religion:

or the name of the beast; Papists, so called from the pope; thus the
antichristians are called from antichrist, as the Christians from
Christ:

or the number of his name; which is either the same with the number of
the beast in [Rev 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#018.md), or is
something distinct it; and those who have it may be such persons who
neither have the indelible character of the Romish clergy, nor are open
professors of the Popish religion, but are in heart inclined to it, and
privately and secretly promote it, by their doctrines and practices; and
so are numbered, reckoned, esteemed, and accounted of by the Papists,
and receive favours from them; or rather such who openly "furnish the
drink offering" in the Mass, mixed with wine and water, "for that
number", [Isa 65:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#011.md).

[Revelation 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rev 13:18</span></span>

Here is wisdom,.... Not only in the above description of the two beasts,
but in what follows as to the number of the beast, these two now
coalescing in one, and have one and the same number; and to wrap it up,
and conceal it in such an obscure manner, shows great wisdom in God, as
it requires much in men, and serves greatly to exercise all his
intellectual powers to find it out:

let him that hath understanding count the number of, the beast; whoever
has skill numbers, let him make use of it, that he may know the name and
nature of the antichristian beast, and the numerical letters of his
name, or the number of him, and of the time when he arose, and when he
will expire:

for it is the number of a man: either a number that may be reckoned by
man, or which is in common use among men; see [Rev
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#017.md); or that which is contained in
the name of a man:

and his number is six hundred threescore and six: which some think
refers to the time of the rise of antichrist, in the year 666; but that
seems rather to be in the year 859, when the bishop of Rome obtained the
name of universal bishop; others have been of opinion that it refers to
the expiration of the beast, which they thought would have been in the
year 1666, the number of the thousand being dropped, as it is in our
common way of speaking; as when we say the Spanish invasion was in 88,
meaning 1588, and the civil wars began in 41, that is, 1641; but time
has shown that this was a mistaken sense; the more prevailing opinion is
that of Mr. Potter, who has wrote a peculiar and learned treatise upon
this passage, who makes the counting of this number to be no other than
the extracting of its root, which is the number 25, which when
multiplied into itself, and the fraction in working it 41 is added,
makes up the square number 666; and now 25 being added to A. D. 33, make
58, which was the time of the beast's conception, to which if 666 is
added, it brings us to the year 724, when he arrived to his age of
manhood, and when the war about the worshipping of images broke out: but
others think that the numeral letters in some man's name which amount to
this date, and which agrees with antichrist, are intended; and here
various conjectures are made; some have observed, that in genealogical
arithmetic the number of Adonikam's posterity is 666, [Ezr
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#013.md); whose name signifies "a lord
rising up", or "risen"; and suits very well with antichrist, who is
risen up, and assumes a lordly domination over the kings of the earth;
and it is further observed, that the Hebrew word which signifies
"Roman", and, having the word beast or kingdom joined to it, designs the
Roman beast, or kingdom, consists of numeral letters, which make up this
sum; and so the Hebrew word "Sethut", which is the name of a man, [Num
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#013.md), and signifies "mystery", in its
numeral letters comes just to this number, and one of the names of the
whore of Babylon is "mystery", [Rev
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#005.md); but the name "Lateinos" bids as
fair as any, which is mentioned by so ancient a writer as Irenaeus, who
was a hearer of Polycarp, a disciple of John, the writer of this book;
now the numeral value of the letters of this word makes up exactly 666,
thus; 30. 1. 300. 5. 10. 50. 70. 200. in all 666; and it is well known
that the church of Rome is called the Latin Church and the pope of Rome
the head of the Latin church, and his seat is in the Latin empire, and
the service of the beast is in the Latin tongue, and the Bible is kept
in that language, from the reading of the common people: it has been
observed that the numeral letters in Ludovicus, or Lewis, which is a
common name of the French kings, and is the name of the present French
king, make up this same number; and may denote the destruction of
antichrist, which will quickly follow the downfall of the kingdom of
France, under a king of this name; and the rather, since this was the
last of the ten kingdoms that was set up, and in which the primitive
beast subsists, and the only one that has not yet been conquered, or in
which a revolution has not been; and since this is the tenth part of the
city which shall fall a little before the third woe comes on: and that
it may fall under Ludovicus, or Lewis, the present French king (a), may
be hoped for, and is desirable.
