### [Isaiah Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 11:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO ISAIAH 11

This chapter is a prophecy of the Messiah, and gives an account of his
descent, as man; of his qualifications for his office, as a Judge and
King; of his performance of it; of the peaceableness of his kingdom; of
the spread of it among the Gentiles, by the preaching of the Gospel; and
of the last and general conversion of the Jews. His original and descent
from David the son of Jesse, under the titles of a rod and branch, is
described as mean and obscure, expressed by stem and roots, [Isa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md) his gifts and qualifications for
his work, in general and particular, [Isa
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002.md) the performance of it, both with
respect to good men and bad men, in the fear of the Lord, with all
equity, righteousness, and readiness, [Isa
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#003.md) the peaceableness of his kingdom
is figuratively expressed, by the agreement of savage and tame
creatures, the former becoming the latter, and so losing their malignant
and hurtful nature, through the efficacy of the Gospel, spreading the
knowledge of Christ all over the world, [Isa
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#006.md) particularly among the Gentiles,
comparable to those savage creatures, who, upon the exhibition of Christ
in the Gospel; should seek to him, and find rest in him, [Isa
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010.md) which will be followed or
accompanied with a collection of the Jews out of all lands, and the
conversion of them, which will be brought about by the power and grace
of God, all impediments being by him removed out of the way; the
consequences of which will be, peace among themselves, and obedience
among the Gentiles, [Isa 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011.md).

[Isaiah 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 11:1</span></span>

And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse,.... By which
is meant, not Hezekiah, as R. Moses (o) the priest, and others, since he
was now born, and must be at least ten or twelve years of age; but the
Messiah, as both the text and context show, and as is owned by many
Jewish writers (p), ancient and modern: and he is called a "rod", either
because of his unpromising appearance, arising "out of the stem of
Jesse"; from him, in the line of David, when that family was like a tree
cut down, and its stump only left in the ground, which was the case when
Jesus was born of it: Jesse's family was at first but a mean and obscure
one; it became very illustrious in David's time, and in some following
reigns; from the Babylonish captivity, till the time of Christ, it was
very low; and at the birth of Christ was low indeed, his supposed father
being a carpenter, and his real mother Mary a poor virgin, dwelling at
Nazareth; and it seemed very unlikely, under these circumstances, that
he should be the King Messiah, and be so great as was foretold he
should; and have that power, authority, and wisdom he had; and do such
mighty works as he did; and especially be the author of eternal
salvation; and bring forth such fruits, and be the cause of such
blessings of grace, as he was: or else because of his kingly power and
majesty, the rod or branch being put for a sceptre, and so a symbol of
that; to which the Targum agrees, paraphrasing the words thus,

"and a King shall come forth from the sons of Jesse:''

and the sense is, that though Jesse's or David's family should be
brought so very low as to be as the stem or stump of a tree, without a
body, branches, leaves, and fruit; yet from thence should arise a mighty
King, even the King Messiah, who is spoken of by so many august names
and titles, [Isa 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md) and this is
observed for the comfort of the people of Israel, when distressed by the
Assyrians, as in the preceding chapter [Isa
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#001.md); when those high ones, comparable
to the loftiest cedars in Lebanon, and to the tallest trees in the
forest, should be hewn down, a rod should come out of Jesse's stem,
which should rise higher, and spread more than ever they did:

and a branch shall grow out of his roots; the roots of Jesse, out of his
family, compared to the stump of a tree; meaning either his ancestors,
as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, Boaz, and Obed; or his posterity, as
David, Joseph, and Mary; and so the Targum,

"and the Messiah shall be anointed (or exalted) from his children's
children.''

The branch is a well known name of the Messiah; See Gill on [Isa
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#002.md) the word Netzer, here used, is the
name of the city of Nazareth (q); which perhaps was so called, from the
trees, plants, and grass, which grew here; and so our Lord's dwelling
here fulfilled a prophecy, that he should be called a Nazarene; or an
inhabitant of Netzer, [Mat 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#023.md). The
Jews (r) speak of one Ben Netzer, who they say was a robber, took
cities, and reigned over them, and became the head of robbers; and make
(s) him to be the little horn in [Dan
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008.md) and wickedly and maliciously say
(t) he was Jesus; and yet, under all this wickedness, they tacitly own
that Jesus of Nazareth is the Netzer this prophecy speaks of; the design
of which is to show the meanness of Christ's descent as man, and that he
should be as a root out of a dry ground, [Isa
53:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002.md) or rather as a rod and branch out
of a dry root.

[Isaiah 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 11:2</span></span>

And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him,.... The rod and branch,
the King Messiah, so qualifying him for his office, and the discharge of
it. This shows that Christ's kingdom is of a spiritual nature, and
administered in a spiritual manner, for which he was abundantly
furnished by the "Spirit of the Lord" resting on him; by whom is meant
the third Person in the Trinity, so called, not because created by him,
for not any created spirit is meant, but because he proceeded from him;
he is the one Jehovah with him, a divine Person, truly God, yet distinct
both from the Father and the Son; so that here is a clear proof of the
trinity of Persons. Christ was filled with the Spirit from the womb, and
he descended and rested upon him at his baptism; he was anointed with
him to be Prophet, Priest, and King, and received his gifts and graces
from him without measure, which abide with him, and are designed in the
following words:

the spirit of wisdom and understanding; which appeared in his
disputation with the doctors; in his answers to the ensnaring questions
of the Scribes and Pharisees; in the whole of his ministry; and in his
conduct at his apprehension, trial, condemnation, and death; as also in
the wisdom, knowledge, and understanding he imparted to his disciples,
and does more or less to all his people:

the spirit of counsel and might; of "counsel", which fitted him to be
the wonderful Counsellor, and qualified him to give suitable and proper
advice to the sons of men; and of "might" or "power", to preach the
Gospel with authority; do miracles in the confirmation of it; bear the
sins of his people, and the punishment due to them; obtain eternal
redemption for them; and engage with all their enemies and conquer them:

the spirit of knowledge, and of the fear of the Lord; and so as man had
the "knowledge" of God the Father; of his mind and will; of the
Scriptures, and things contained therein; of the law and Gospel; all the
treasures of wisdom and knowledge were hid in him, which he communicates
to his saints; and "of the fear of the Lord", and so had a reverence of
him, a strict regard to his will, and always did the things which
pleased him; see [Heb 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007.md) this verse
is also applied to the Messiah, both by ancient and modern Jews (u).

[Isaiah 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 11:3</span></span>

And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord,....
Or "cause him to smell the fear of the Lord" (w); that is, to discern in
whom it was: this is one effect of the Spirit's resting upon him, and
particularly as the spirit of understanding, and of the fear of the
Lord, whereby he has a quick and sharp discerning of it; not merely of
the grace of fear, so as to know what that is, and what the exercise of
it; or so as to make it the rule of his actions, though all this is
true; but so as to discern where and in whom it was, and was not; he
could distinguish between him that feared God and him that feared him
not; he knew Nathanael to be an Israelite indeed, in whom there was no
guile, [Joh 1:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#047.md) and the Scribes and
Pharisees to be hypocrites, [Mat
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#018). As the Jews (x.md) understand this
passage of the Messiah, and of his quick smell, as the word used
signifies, or of his discerning of good and bad men, they make this to
be a rule of judging the Messiah by; and accordingly made use of it with
one that set up himself for the Messiah, and took the name of Barcochab,
the son of a star, referring to [Num
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#017.md) and tried him whether he could
discern a good man from a bad man; and because he could not, they
rejected him as a false Messiah, and called him Barcoziba, the son of a
lie (y): compare with this [Luk 7:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#039.md)
where it may be seen the same notion obtained among the Jews in Christ's
time:

and, he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes; or according to the
outward appearance, the external guise of sanctity and religion men
might put on; as the Scribes and Pharisees were outwardly righteous
before men, but not to Christ, who knew their hearts; they seemed to be
somewhat to others, but nothing to him, because he judged not by
appearances to the eyes:

neither reprove after the hearing of his ears; he needed no testimony of
men, for he knew what was in men; nor did he regard the words of men,
the boastings of a Pharisee, any more than his outward actions; nor
would he reprove or condemn, nor will he, upon a human testimony.

[Isaiah 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 11:4</span></span>

But with righteousness shall he judge the poor,.... The poor sinner,
that is sensible of his spiritual poverty, and comes and acknowledges
his sins and transgressions, and prays for pardoning grace and mercy,
and hungers and thirsts after righteousness; such Christ justifies with
his own righteousness, acquits and discharges them from all sin and
condemnation, as also protects and defends them against all their
enemies and oppressors:

and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth; that is, shall take
the part of the meek, the lowly, and the humble, who are under a sense
of their sins and unworthiness, apply to him for grace, righteousness,
pardon, and eternal life; and for their sakes reprove wicked men that
would distress and crush them; and in a just and equitable manner, in a
way of righteous retaliation, render tribulation to them that trouble
them:

and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth: that is, either
he shall smite the consciences of earthly and unregenerate men, by the
ministration of his word, the rod of his strength, so that they shall be
convinced of sin, and humbled for it, and be brought to repentance
towards God, and faith in himself; or he shall smite the nations of the
earth, the antichristian states, and destroy them, [Rev
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#015.md).

and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked; either by the
words of his mouth, as before; see [Hos
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#005.md) so that they become dead men in
their own apprehensions, have no hope of life and salvation by their own
works, see themselves dead in law, and liable to eternal death and
damnation; or this is to be understood of the destruction of the wicked
at the last day, by a sentence of condemnation pronounced upon them by
Christ; and particularly of antichrist, the wicked and lawless one, the
man of sin and son of perdition, whom the Lord shall consume with the
spirit of his mouth, and destroy with the brightness of his coming, [Th2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004.md) in which place the apostle seems
to have respect to this; nor is the Targum foreign from the sense given,
which is

"he shall smite the sinners of the earth with the word of his mouth, and
with the speech of his lips he shall slay the wicked Armillus.''

Armillus seems to be a name hammered out of Romulus, and designs the
Romish antichrist; for elsewhere the Jews expressly say, that Armillus
is he whom the nations call antichrist (z); by whom they suppose that
Messiah, the son of Joseph shall be slain, and afterwards he himself
shall be slain by Messiah the son of David; or it is the same with a
destroyer of the people, a name that well agrees with antichrist; see
[Rev 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#018.md). This whole, verse is
applied to the Messiah, both by ancient and modern Jews (a).

[Isaiah 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 11:5</span></span>

And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins,.... He shall be
adorned with it, strengthened by it, and ready at all times to perform
it; he loved righteousness, and did acts of righteousness throughout the
whole course of his life; and, by his active and passive obedience,
wrought out an everlasting righteousness for his people; he is a King
that reigns in righteousness, righteousness is the sceptre of his
kingdom; all his administrations of government are righteous; just and
true are all his ways:

and faithfulness the girdle of his reins; he was faithful to God, that
appointed him as King and Head of the church; faithful as a Prophet, in
declaring his mind and will; and is a faithful High Priest, as well as a
merciful one. The Targum, interprets this of righteous and faithful men,
thus,

"and the righteous shall be round about him, and they that work (the
work) of faith shall draw nigh unto him;''

but it is said of a single person, of the Messiah only, to whom it
properly belongs.

[Isaiah 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 11:6</span></span>

And the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb,.... This, and the three
following verses [Isa 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#007.md), describe
the peaceableness of the Messiah's kingdom; and which the Targum
introduces in this manner,

"in the days of the Messiah of Israel, peace shall be multiplied in the
earth.''

The wild and tame creatures shall agree together, and the former shall
become the latter; which is not to be understood literally of the savage
creatures, as if they should lose their nature, and be restored, as it
is said, to their paradisiacal estate, which is supposed to be the time
of the restitution of all things; but figuratively of men, comparable to
wild creatures, who through the power of divine grace, accompanying the
word preached, shall become tame, mild, meek, and humble; such who have
been as ravenous wolves, have worried Christ's sheep, made havoc of
them, breathing out slaughter and threatenings against them, as did
Saul, through converting grace, become as gentle and harmless as lambs,
and take up their residence in Christ's fold, and dwell with, yea, some
of them even feed, Christ's lambs and sheep, as the above mentioned
person:

and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; such who are like the
leopard, for the fierceness of his nature, and the variety of his spots;
who can no more change their hearts and their actions, than that
creature can change its nature and its spots; are so wrought upon by the
power of divine grace, as to drop their rage against the saints, alter
their course of life, and attend on the word and ordinances, lie down
beside the shepherds' tents, where the church feeds her kids, or young
converts:

and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; either dwell
and feed together, or lie down together, or walk together, since it
follows:

and a little child shall lead them; become through the grace of God so
tractable, that they shall be led, guided, and governed by the ministers
of the Gospel, Christ's babes and sucklings, to whom he reveals the
great things of his Gospel, and out of whose mouths he ordains praise.
Bohlius (a) interprets this little child of Christ himself, by whom they
should be led and directed, see [Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md) and the following passages are
referred to the times of the Messiah by the Jewish writers (b); and
Maimonides (c) in particular observes, that they are not to be
understood literally, as if the custom and order of things in the world
would cease, or that things would be renewed as at the creation, but in
a parabolical and enigmatical sense; and interprets them of the
Israelites dwelling safely among the wicked of the nations of the world,
comparable to the wild beasts of the field.

(This verse may apply to the future state when all things will be
restored to their original state before man fell. By Adam's sin, death
and bloodshed were introduced into the creation. [Rom
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#012.md). In the final state these will be
removed and the wild nature of animals become tame. Editor.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 11:7</span></span>

And the cow and the bear shall feed,.... That is, together, in one
church state, at one table, or in one pasture, upon the wholesome food
of the Gospel, the salutary doctrines of Christ; who though before of
different dispositions, the one tame and gentle, useful and profitable,
dispensing the milk of the divine word, and gracious experience; the
other cruel and voracious, barbarous and inhuman, worrying the lambs and
sheep of Christ; but now of the same nature, and having no ill will to
one another, and being without fear of each other:

their young ones shall lie down together; those like the calf and the
young bear, shall lie in the green pastures of Gospel ordinances, and do
no injury, the latter to the former, being of one mind, and agreeing in
doctrine and practice:

and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; kings shall be nursing fathers
to the church, and feed on the same Gospel provisions; and there shall
be a great agreement between them who were before comparable to lions
for their strength, power, and cruelty, and ministers of the Gospel, who
are compared to oxen, for their strength and laboriousness, [Co1
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#009.md) "straw" here denotes true
doctrine, though elsewhere false, see [Co1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#012.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 11:8</span></span>

And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp,.... Without
fear or danger:

and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice's den; and
suffer no damage: the meaning is explained in the next words, and to be
understood of regenerate persons, both of new born babes, or just born,
and all such who are weaned from their own righteousness, and live by
faith on Christ, who shall not be hurt by the poison of false teachers,
nor by the force of violent persecutors, now no more,

See Gill (Editor's note) on "Isa 11:6".

[Isaiah 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 11:9</span></span>

They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain,.... In the
Church, so called, in allusion to the holy hill of Zion; in the latter
day, after the destruction of antichrist, there will be no more
persecution of the saints; they will be no more injured nor harassed by
wicked men, comparable to the above mentioned creatures, either for
their cruelty or cunning; the reason follows:

for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters
cover the sea: full of the Gospel, the means of conveying the knowledge
of Christ, and of God in Christ, of his person and office, of his grace
and righteousness, of peace, pardon, life, and salvation by him. The
phrase denotes the abundance and depth of the knowledge of divine
things, and the large spread of the Gospel, and the multitude of persons
that shall be blessed with it, and a profound knowledge of it; so that
there will be none to molest, disturb, and distress the people of God,
see [Hab 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#014.md) this has had some
appearance of accomplishment at several times; as at the first times of
the Gospel, when the sound of it, by the apostles, went into all the
earth, and diffused the savour of the knowledge of Christ in every
place; and in the times of Constantine, when Paganism was abolished, and
the whole empire became Christian, persecution ceased, and peace ensued,
as before described; and at the Reformation, when whole nations embraced
the Gospel of Christ; but the full accomplishment of it is yet to come,
when the angel shall fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting
Gospel to preach to all men, and the earth shall be lightened with his
glory; when men shall run to and fro, and knowledge be increased, and
all shall know the Lord, from the least to the greatest. This passage is
applied to the times of the Messiah by the Jews, ancient and modern (d).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 11:10</span></span>

And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse,.... The Messiah, so
called, either with respect to his human nature, who was to spring from
Jesse; so the Targum,

"and there shall be at that time a son of the sons of Jesse;''

who, when incarnate, was like a root under ground, hidden to men, as to
the glory of his person, and the fulness of his grace, and was mean,
abject, and contemptible in their view; or rather with respect to his
divine nature, just as he is called "the root and offspring of David",
[Rev 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#005.md) the former as God, the latter
as man; and so the phrase may denote his eternity, being before Jesse,
or any other man or creature whatever; and his being the Creator and
preserver of all, of Jesse, and of all others; and, as Mediator, he is
the root from whom Jesse, and all the elect of God, are; they have their
being in him; they are rooted and grounded in him; and are bore by him
as the branches by the root; and they have their life and nourishment,
their fruitfulness, holiness, and perseverance therein from him. This is
understood of the Messiah, by ancient and modern Jews (e):

which shall stand for an ensign of the people; in the ministration of
the Gospel, for the gathering of the people of God to him, to enlist in
his service, and fight under his banner, where they may be sure of
victory; an ensign set up, a banner displayed, is for the gathering of
soldiers together; it is a sign of preparation for war, and an
encouragement to it; and is sometimes done when victory is obtained, see
[Isa 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#026.md) and is a direction where
soldiers should stand, when they should march, and who they should
follow, as well as it serves to distinguish one company from another;
and of all this use is the preaching of Christ and his Gospel:

to it shall the Gentiles seek; that is, to Christ, signified by the root
of Jesse, and set up for an ensign of the people; being sought out by
him in redemption and calling, and being sensible of their need of him,
and that there is something valuable in him, having had a manifestation
of him to them; and therefore seek to him, not out of curiosity, nor
with worldly views, nor in the last, but in the first place, and
chiefly; not hypocritically, but sincerely, and with their whole hearts;
not carelessly, but diligently and constantly; not partially, but for
everything they want; principally for the kingdom of God, and his
righteousness, for eternal glory and happiness, and for a justifying
righteousness, as the title to it: or to him shall they "betake
themselves" (f), see [Deu 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#005.md) as to
an ensign, standard bearer, captain-general, leader and commander of the
people; or as to a stronghold, for protection from enemies; or as to a
city of refuge, to secure from avenging justice and wrath to come; and,
under a sense of danger and ruin, to one that is able to save; and for
help to one that is mighty; or him "shall" they "consult" (g); or seek
to him for advice and counsel, see [Isa
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019.md) who is a most proper person to be
consulted on all occasions, he being the wonderful Counsellor, [Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md). This is a prophecy of the calling
of the Gentiles, and which had its accomplishment, in part, in the first
times of the Gospel, and will be completely fulfilled in the last days:

and his rest shall be glorious; either that which Christ gives to those
that seek unto him, and which is both a spiritual rest here, from the
burden and guilt of sin, and the tyrannical power of it; from the
bondage, curse, and condemnation of the law; from a sense of divine
wrath; and a rest in afflictions, though not from them; and an eternal
rest hereafter, a "rest in glory" (h); as the words may be rendered
here; it will be a glorious one, the bodies of the saints at death rest
in the grave, and their souls in the arms of Jesus; and after the
resurrection, body and soul will rest together from sin and Satan, from
unbelief, doubts, and fears, and from all enemies; or else this rest is
what Christ himself enjoys. Some understand it of his death, which,
though ignominious in itself, yet glorious in its consequences; a
glorious display of the condescension and love of Christ was made in it;
and glorious things have been effected by it: others, of his grave,
which was an honourable man's; his grave was made with the rich; though
perhaps better of his rest in glory; when he had done his work, and sat
down at the right hand of God, he was crowned with glory and honour; or
rather it may design his church, which is his rest, [Psa
132:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#013.md) which is glorious, with his
righteousness, grace, and presence, and being put in order by him, as an
army with banners; and especially it will be, when all the glorious
things spoken of it shall be fulfilled.

[Isaiah 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 11:11</span></span>

And it shall come to pass in that day,.... Before spoken of, and which
includes the whole Gospel dispensation:

that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time; which refers to
a first, in which the Lord exerted his power in the recovery of his
people out of the hands of their enemies; and that was the deliverance
of them out of Egypt, and which was typical of the deliverance of the
Lord's people in the times of Christ; and it is usual with the Jews (i)
to call Moses the first redeemer, and the Messiah the latter; wherefore
this "second time" refers to the times of the Messiah, and not to the
time of the deliverance from the Babylonish captivity; for that, as Aben
Ezra, Jarchi, and Kimchi observe, was not a perfect redemption; only
Judah and Benjamin returned, not the ten tribes, and so did not answer
to the first time, when all Israel came out of Egypt; and much less can
it be understood of the return of those, in the times of Hezekiah,
carried captive by Tilgathpilneser and Shalmaneser: or the first and
second time may be distinguished thus; the first time may intend the
calling of a large number, both of Jews and Gentiles, through the
preaching of the Gospel by the apostles; and the second time the
bringing in the fulness of the Gentiles, and the conversion of the Jews,
in the latter day; or the first time may respect the calling of the
Gentiles, and the second the gathering in of the Jews: or both may
intend later times; the first time, the reformation from Popery; the
second time, deliverance from Babylon, or the antichristian yoke, under
which all nations will again be brought, before the destruction of the
man of sin:

to recover the remnant of his people; or to "obtain", or to "possess"
(k); for this is not to be understood of the recovery or redemption of
them by the price of Christ's blood, but of the calling and conversion
of them, when the Lord claims them, possesses and enjoys them, as his
own; and as they are but a remnant whom God has chosen for his people,
and Christ has redeemed by his blood, so they are no other that are
called; though here they may be called a remnant, or what remains, with
respect to those who have been called already:

which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt; Egypt, and other
places following, being joined with Assyria, show that this cannot be
understood of the deliverance from the Babylonish captivity; but designs
the several places where Christ would have a people in Gospel times, and
who would be found out, and called by grace; some of which already have
been, as in Babylon and Egypt, [Pe1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#013.md) and others will be hereafter,
according to the prophecies, [Psa
68:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#031.md) and as Assyria and Egypt are now
in the hands of the Turks, it may design the call and conversion of many
in those parts, when the Turkish empire shall be destroyed; or else the
deliverance of God's people from the tyranny of the Romish antichrist,
called Egypt and Babylon, at the time of his ruin:

from Pathros; by which some understand Parthia, as Manasseh ben Israel
(l), and Calvin thinks it probable; many of this country were converted
in the first times of the Gospel; the Apostle John's first epistle is
called by the ancients the Epistle to the Parthians, see [Act
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#009.md) and very likely there will be more
of them in the latter day: others think Arabia Petraea is intended; it
seems to be a part of Egypt last mentioned, as appears from [Eze
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#014.md) and is mentioned with some
cities in Egypt, [Jer 44:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#001.md) and had its
name very likely from Pathrusim, a son of Mizraim, [Gen
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#014.md). Thebais is here meant, the
extreme part of Egypt, next to Ethiopia, which is designed by what
fellows, according to Sir John Marsham (m), and Bochart (n), and
Vitringa after them:

and from Cush; or Ethiopia; from whence some have been called, see [Act
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#027.md) and others will, according to
prophecy, [Psa 68:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#031.md) and in part of
this country now live the Abyssines, who profess Christianity: or rather
Arabia, see [Gal 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#017.md). The Targum
renders it,

"from India:''

and from Elam; a province in Persia, [Dan
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#002.md) the inhabitants of this place are
called Elamites, [Act 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#009.md) some of
these heard the apostles speak the wonderful things of God in their own
language, and were converted:

and from Shinar; in Chaldea, in the plain of which the tower of Babel
was built, [Gen 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#010.md) wherefore the
Targum renders it,

"from Babylon:''

and from Hamath; meaning either Antiochia, as some, or Cilicia, as
others. Cocceius says it is a country which lies towards the
Mediterranean sea, over against Cyprus, above Mount Libanus, where now
is Tripoli:

and from the islands of the sea; or of the west; the European islands,
particularly England, Ireland, and Scotland, and others. Aben Ezra
refers this prophecy to the times of the Messiah, and so does Manasseh
ben Israel.

[Isaiah 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 11:12</span></span>

And he shall set up an ensign for the nations,.... For the gathering of
them, for the calling of the Gentiles, that is, the Lord would do it; he
who before is said to set his hand a second time to recover his people,
whether among Jews or Gentiles; this he has done in the ministration of
the Gospel, in which Christ is lifted up and held forth as the only
Saviour of lost sinners, the sole author and glorious Captain of
salvation, for them to flee to, and lay hold on; and this he still does,
and will continue to do, until all his people are gathered in from the
several parts of the world:

and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel; so those of his people among
the ten tribes, that were scattered about in various countries, when the
Gospel was preached throughout the world by the apostles, were called by
it, and gathered into Gospel churches among the Gentiles, of whom the
first churches of Christ consisted; and so it will be in the latter day,
when all Israel shall be saved:

and gather together the dispersed of Judah; the Jews, scattered about
like lost sheep, among each of the nations of the world; some of which
were looked up, and found out, and brought into the sheepfold, in the
first times of Christianity; and others will be in the latter day:

even from the four corners of the earth: which shows that this cannot
intend the return of the Jews from the Babylonish captivity, which was
only from one corner of the earth; The Targum is,

"from the four winds of the earth;''

a phrase the same with that in [Rev
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#001.md).

[Isaiah 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 11:13</span></span>

The envy also of Ephraim shall depart,.... With which it envied Judah,
on account of the kingdom of the house of David, and the temple being in
that tribe; not that this is the thing intended, only alluded to; the
meaning is, that whatever envy or jealousy subsisted in the Gentile
against the Jew, or in the Jew against the Gentile, should be no more,
when gathered into one Gospel church state; or whatever of this kind has
appeared in one Christian church, or denomination among Christians,
against another, shall cease, when the Gospel in its power and purity
shall more generally take place, and the earth shall be filled with it:

and the adversaries of Judah, or of God's professing people,

shall be cut off; and be no more, as the Turks and Papists:

Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex Ephraim; this is
repeated for the confirmation of it; and the sense is, that all
animosities, contentions, and discords, shall cease among the people of
God, and there shall be entire peace and harmony among them. Jarchi
interprets this of the two Messiahs, Messiah ben Joseph, and Messiah ben
Judah, the Jews dream of.

[Isaiah 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 11:14</span></span>

But they shall flee upon the shoulders of the Philistines towards the
west,.... That is, Ephraim and Judah, who shall not only agree among
themselves, but cheerfully join together against the common enemy: "they
shall flee with the shoulder", as some render the words; with joint
consent, as the phrase is used in [Hos
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#009.md), [Zep
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#009.md) and so the Targum,

"and they shall be joined together in one shoulder, to smite the
Philistines;''

the Septuagint version is, "they shall flee in the ships of strangers";
and so Abarbinel interprets it of the ships of the Philistines, Genoese,
and Venetians, that shall bring the Israelites from the west to the
east, and carry them in ships by sea. The Philistines were the sworn
enemies of the Israelites, and lay to the west of the land of Israel,
and when the Gospel was sent into all the world, it began to be preached
in the parts of Palestine, whereby many were converted, and embraced it,
as foretold they should, [Psa 87:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004.md) and
flying upon their shoulders, as it denotes the conquest of them, and
their subjection to the Gospel, so the swiftness of the apostles in
carrying it to them, when they had a commission to do it, who were all
of them Jews, of one tribe or another; and these may also design the
enemies of the people of God now, the antichristian states, some of
which will fall off from Popery, receive the Gospel, hate the whore, eat
her flesh, and burn her with fire; which will be brought about by the
preaching of the Gospel by its ministers, who will fly in the midst of
heaven, and upon the shoulders of the Romish antichrist, and proclaim
the fall of Babylon, and call upon, the Lord's people to come out of it,
[Rev 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#006.md),

they shall spoil them of the east together; the Syrians and Arabians,
who lay east of Judea; perhaps the Turks are meant, and the destruction
of the Ottoman empire, whereby way will be made for the kings and
kingdoms of the east to know, receive, and profess the Gospel of Christ,
[Rev 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#012.md).

they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab; or "there shall be a
sending out of their hand"; that is, they shall stretch out their hand,
and lay hold on these people, and bring them into subjection to them;
which is to be understood of the sending out of the Gospel, by the hands
of the ministers of it, into those countries where the Moabites and
Edomites formerly dwelt; and thereby bringing them into subjection to
Christ and his churches:

and the children of Ammon shall obey them; that have the rule in the
house of God, submitting to the laws and ordinances of Christ.

[Isaiah 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 11:15</span></span>

And the Lord shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea,....
Which Kimchi and Abarbinel interpret of the Egyptian river Sichor, or
the Nile; others of a bay of the Egyptian sea, so called because in the
form of a tongue; the destroying of it designs the drying of it up, so
that people might pass over it dry shod; the allusion is to the drying
up of the Red Sea, when the Israelites came out of Egypt, and passed
through it, as on dry land; and it intends the destruction of Egypt
itself, not literally by the Romans, in the times of Augustus Caesar, as
Jerom thinks, who interprets the "strong wind", in the following clause,
of them; but figuratively, the destruction of Rome, which is spiritually
called Egypt, [Rev 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#008.md) and the utter
destruction of it, by an anathema, and with a curse, from the Lord
himself; as the word here used signifies; and which will take place upon
the battle at Armageddon, [Rev 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#016.md)
which has its name from the word in the text:

and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river; in
allusion to Moses's stretching out his hand over the Red sea, and the
Lord's causing it to go back with a strong east wind, [Exo
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#021.md). Some understand this of the
river Nile as before, and that because of what follows; but Jarchi and
Kimchi interpret it of the river Euphrates, which is commonly understood
in Scripture when "the river", without any explication, is made mention
of; and so the Targum,

"and the Lord shall dry up the tongue of the Egyptian sea, and shall
lift up the stroke of his strength upon Euphrates, by the word of his
prophets;''

and this designs the destruction of the Turks, or the Ottoman empire,
which is signified by the drying up of the river Euphrates, [Rev
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#012.md) where it is thought by some
there is an allusion to the words here:

and shall smite it in the seven streams; which have made some think the
river Nile is meant, because that had its seven streams, or gates, as
Juvenal calls (o) them, or mouths, by which the sea issued into it;
which are called (p) the Canopic or Heracleotic, the Bolbitine or
Bolbitic, the Sebennitic, the Phatnitic, the Mendesian, the Tanitic or
Saitic, and the Pelusian or Bubastic, from the cities Canopus and
Heracleum, Bolbitine, Sebennytus, Phatnus, Mendes, Tanis or Sais,
Pelusium, and Bubastus, built on the shore of these entrances; but it
may be observed, that the river Euphrates was drained by seven ditches
or rivulets by Cyrus, when Babylon was taken, by which means his
soldiers entered the city dry shod, to which the allusion may be here;
and it may denote the entire destruction of the Turkish empire, in all
its branches; for "seven", as Kimchi observes, may signify a multitude,
even the many kingdoms, people, and nations, under that jurisdiction:

and make men go over dryshod; or "with shoes", with them on, there being
no need to pluck them off, the river and its streams being dried up; by
the "men" are, meant the "kings of the east", of which See Gill on [Rev
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#012.md) all these phrases denote the
removal of all impediments out of the way of God's people in those
parts, in coming over to the Christian religion, and their embracing and
professing that.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 11:16</span></span>

And there shall be a highway for the remnant of his people,.... That is,
through the river; that being dried up, and all hindrances and obstacles
being removed, the way will be clear for multitudes to walk in without
interruption, like a large common, highway, or causeway; so the
Mahometan, Pagan, and Papal kingdoms being destroyed, and with them each
of their religions, the way of truth, righteousness, and holiness, will
be manifest to the remnant of the Lord's people; who will be at this
time in those parts, in which they will be directed to walk, and will
walk, and not err, see [Isa 35:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#008.md),

which shall be left from Assyria; the Septuagint and Arabic versions
read, "which is left in Egypt"; and designs the remnant, according to
the election of grace, that shall be in any of the antichristian
countries, either Mahometan or Papal; rather the former seems intended,
who shall at this time be brought to the knowledge of Christ, and to
walk in his ways:

like as it was to Israel in that day that he came up out of the land of
Egypt; that is, as there was a highway made through the Red Sea, in
which Israel passed, as on dry land, when they came out of Egypt, and
went through the wilderness to Canaan's land.
