### [Joshua Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#001.md)

[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jos 12:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO JOSHUA 12

This chapter gives a short account of the conquests made by the
Israelites, both in the times of Moses and of Joshua, and first of the
kingdom of Sihon and Og on the other side Jordan, in the times of Moses,
and which he gave to the two tribes of Reuben and Gad, and the half
tribe of Manasseh, and which are particularly described, [Jos
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#001.md); and then of the kings and the
countries on this side Jordan whom Joshua conquered, [Jos
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#007.md); and the names of the thirty one
kingdoms are recited, that so it might be exactly known and observed
what were afterwards divided among the tribes and possessed by them,
[Jos 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#009.md).

[Joshua 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 12:1</span></span>

Now these are the kings of the land which the children of Israel
smote,.... In the days of Moses, as Jarchi remarks, and as it clearly
appears from what follows:

and possessed, their land on the other side Jordan toward the rising of
the sun; on the east of the land of Canaan:

from the river Arnon unto the mount Hermon, and all the plain on the
east; Arnon was the border of Moab between them and the Amorites, [Num
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#013.md); and from hence to Hermon, a
mountain adjoining to Lebanon, lay the country of the two kings of the
Amorites after mentioned, [Deu 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#008.md);
and the plain on the east were the plains of Moab, which lay to the east
of Jordan.

[Joshua 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 12:2</span></span>

Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon,.... Which he took from
the Moabites, and made his capital city, [Num
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#026.md),

and ruled from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the river of Arnon; a
city of Moab, which never fell into the hands of Sihon, and therefore he
is said to rule from it but not over it:

and from the middle of the river; that is, the river Arnon, which being
the boundary of the Moabites and Amorites, the king of the Amorites
might be said to rule from the middle of it:

and from half Gilead even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of
the children of Ammon; so it is said to be, [Deu
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#016.md); it should be rendered, not "from
half Gilead", but "and half Gilead", as it is in the Hebrew text, and so
in the Targum; for half Gilead belonged to the kingdom of Sihon, as the
other half did to the kingdom of Og, as in [Jos
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#005.md); and so Jarchi remarks.

[Joshua 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 12:3</span></span>

And from the plain,.... Or rather, "and the plain", the plains of Moab,
which, before possessed by the Israelites, belonged to the kingdom of
Sihon; and the plains of Jordan, which reached

to the sea of Cinneroth on the east; the same with the lake of
Gennesaret, and sea of Tiberias, mentioned in the New Testament, [Mat
14:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#034.md),

and unto the sea of the plain; where stood the cities of the plain,
Sodom, Gomorrah, &c.

even the salt sea on the east; the same with the dead sea, into which
the plain the above cities stood on was converted:

the way to Bethjeshimoth; which was a place in the plains of Moab, [Num
33:49](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#049.md),

and from the south under Ashdothpisgah; or the springs of Pisgah, which
flowed from the mount of that name, [Deu
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#017.md).

[Joshua 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 12:4</span></span>

And the coast of Og king of Bashan,.... The country that he reigned
over, who was another king of the Amorites, smitten by Israel in the
times of Moses:

which was of the remnant of the giants; See Gill on [Deu
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#011.md),

that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei; of which two places see [Deu
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#004.md); it seems as if Og had a palace in
each of those cities, and sometimes was at one and sometimes at another,
as is usual with kings.

[Joshua 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 12:5</span></span>

And reigned in Mount Hermon,.... That is, over all the people that
inhabited that mount or dwelt under it, [Jos
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#017.md), and adjacent to it, of which
mountain; see Gill on [Deu 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#008.md) and See
Gill on [Deu 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#009.md),

and in Salcah: which was a city belonging to the kingdom of Og, [Deu
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#010.md),

and in all Bashan; or Batanea, a country famous for pasturage, [Mic
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#014.md), and for fat cattle, [Eze
39:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#018.md), and for oaks, [Isa
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#013.md), frequently mentioned in
Scripture:

unto the border of the Geshurites, and the Maachathites; which were two
nations the Israelites never expelled, [Jos
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#013.md); of which see [Deu
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#014.md),

and half Gilead; which belonged to Og, as the other half did to Sihon,
before observed, which was as follows:

the border of Sihon king of Heshbon; here the two kingdoms joined, even
in the midst of Gilead, which was divided between them, but now wholly
fell into the hands of Israel.

[Joshua 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 12:6</span></span>

Them did Moses the servant of the Lord, and the children of Israel,
smite,.... That is, the inhabitants of those kingdoms they smote with
the edge of the sword, and took possession of them, the history of which
see in [Num 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#001.md),

and Moses the servant of the Lord gave it; the whole dominion of the two
kings before mentioned:

for a possession unto the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half
tribe of Manasseh: of which grant, and the conditions of it, see [Num
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#001.md).

[Joshua 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 12:7</span></span>

And these are the kings of the country,.... After particularly named,
[Jos 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#009.md),

which Joshua and the children of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the
west; that is, on the west of Jordan:

from Baalgad, in the valley of Lebanon, even unto the mount Halak,

that goeth up to Seir; of which see [Jos
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#017.md),

which Joshua gave unto the tribes of Israel for a possession,

according to their divisions; as after related in this book.

[Joshua 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jos 12:8</span></span>

In the mountains, and in the valleys, and in the plains, and in the
springs, and in the wilderness, and in the south country,.... Which is a
description of the whole land of Canaan; some parts of which were hills
and mountains, others vales and champaign fields; others were dry and
barren, and others well watered; some part of it lay to the north, as
towards Lebanon, and others to the south, towards Seir:

the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the
Hivites, and the Jebusites; which were the nations that inhabited the
land of Canaan before it was taken and possessed by the Israelites.

[Joshua 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 12:9</span></span>

The king of Jericho, one,.... Who was first taken, and so named first,
[Jos 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#021.md),

the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one; who was next taken and
though Bethel was so near Ai, it had a king of its own, after mentioned,
see [Jos 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#001.md).

[Joshua 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 12:10</span></span>

The king of Jerusalem, one,.... Whose name was Adonizedek, and was one
of the five kings taken and hanged, [Jos
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#001.md),

the king of Hebron, one; another of the five kings, whose name was
Hoham, [Jos 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#003.md).

[Joshua 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jos 12:11</span></span>

The king of Jarmuth, one,.... Whose name was Piram, a third of the five
kings before observed, [Jos 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#003.md),

the king of Lachish, one; another of them, whose name was Japhia, [Jos
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#003.md).

[Joshua 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jos 12:12</span></span>

The king of Eglon, one,.... The last of the five kings, and his name was
Debir, [Jos 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#003.md),

the king of Gezer, one; who came up to help Lachish, and his name was
Horam, [Jos 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#033.md).

[Joshua 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jos 12:13</span></span>

The king of Debir, one,.... The same with Kirjathsepher, of which place;
see Gill on [Jos 10:38](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#038.md),

the king of Geder, one: Jerom (h) seems to confound this with the tower
of Eder, beyond which Jacob pitched his tent, [Gen
35:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#021.md); and he speaks of a Gaddera in
the tribe of Judah, in his time a village belonging to the country about
Aelia or Jerusalem, and of Gahedur in the tribe of Judah, a large
village, ten miles from Diospolis or Lydda, as you go to Eleutheropolis:
it seems to be the same with Gederah, [Jos
15:36](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#036.md), or Gedor, [Jos
15:58](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#058.md).

1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#017.md); see [Jos
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#003.md),

the king of Arad, one; perhaps the same with Arath, which, Jerom (i)
says, is the border of the land of Judah, and is twenty miles distant
from Hebron to the south; see [Num
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#001.md).

Makkedah, Debir, and of other places were, [Jos
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#029.md),

the king of Adullam, one; a city in the tribe of Judah, [Jos
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#035); Jerom says (k.md) there was a
village in his time, not a small one, called by this name, ten miles to
the east of Eleutheropolis: near to this place was a cave where David
hid himself when he fled from Saul, [Sa1
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#001.md); See Gill on [Mic

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jos 12:16</span></span>

The king of Makkedah, one,.... In a cave near to which five kings hid
themselves, and were taken out and hanged, and the city afterwards was
taken by Joshua, [Jos 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#016.md); which
fell to the lot of the tribe of Judah, [Jos
15:41](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#041.md),

the king of Bethel, one; a city near to Ai, about a mile from it, and
yet had a king over it: it was taken at the same time that Ai was, [Jos
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#002.md); and fell to the lot of Benjamin,
[Jos 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#022.md).

[Joshua 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jos 12:17</span></span>

The king of Tappuah, one,.... Which Jerom calls (l) Thaffu; it signifies
an apple, and perhaps had its name from plenty of that fruit that grew
there: a city of this name fell to the tribe of Judah, [Jos
15:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#034.md); where also was another place
called Bethtappuah, [Jos 15:53](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#053.md); and
both different from another Tappuah on the border of Manasseh, which
belonged to the tribe of Ephraim, [Jos
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#008.md); by some thought to be meant
here:

the king of Hepher, one; mention is made of Gittahhepher as on the
border of Zebulun, [Jos 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#013.md); the
same with Gathhepher, of which place was the Prophet Jonah, [Kg2
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025.md); and of the land of Hepher in
[Kg1 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#010.md); which is said by Jerom to
be in the same tribe, and not far from Diocaesarea or Zippore; and we
read of a Chepher or Hepher in the Jewish writings (m), which, according
to the account of it there given, could not be far from the same place,
at least it must be less than twelve miles from it.

[Joshua 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jos 12:18</span></span>

The king of Aphek, one,.... There was a place called Aphekah in the
tribe of Judah, [Jos 15:53](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#053.md); and an
Aphek that was on the border of the Amorites, [Jos
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#004.md); and another in the tribe of
Asher, [Jos 19:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#030); but Adrichomius (n.md)
places this Aphek in the tribe of Issachar, whose king Joshua smote, and
takes it to be the same place where the Philistines in the times of
Samuel and David brought their armies against Israel, [Sa1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#001.md); and where the king of Syria
fought against Israel, [Kg1 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#026.md); and
says that its ruins were now shown in the great plain not far from
Gilboa to the east of Mount Carmel, and five miles from Tabor:

the king of Lasharon, one; which, according to the Vulgate Latin
version, is the same with Saron, which, in [Act
9:35](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#035.md), in some copies is called
Assaron; so Adrichomius (o), who places it in the tribe of Ephraim, and
takes it to be the same Sharon Isaiah speaks of, [Isa
33:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#009); and of which Jerom says (p.md), to
this day there is a country between Tabor and the lake of Tiberias
called Saronas, and also that from Caesarea of Palestine to the town of
Joppa, all the land that is seen bears that name.

the king of Hazor, one; whose name was Jabin, and of him and his city;
see Gill on [Jos 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#001.md).

The king of Shimronmeron, one,.... See [Jos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#001.md), this place fell to the tribe of
Zebulun, [Jos 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#015.md),

the king of Achshaph, one; see [Jos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#001.md); this city fell to the lot of

The king of Taanach, one,.... It was in the tribe of Manasseh, [Jos
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011); Jerom says (q.md), in his time it
was a large village, distant from Legion on the plain of Esdraelon three
miles:

the king of Megiddo, one; which belonged to the same tribe, [Jos
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011.md); near this place were some
waters where the Canaanites fought with the Israelites, [Jdg
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#019.md); and a valley where Josiah was
slain, [Ch2 35:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#022.md).

Naphtali, and was one of the cities of refuge, [Jos
19:37](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#037.md); it was situated in upper
Galilee on Mount Naphtali, four miles from the city of Sephet, and as
many from Capernaum, and twenty miles from Tyre (r):

the king of Jokneam of Carmel, one; a city that came to the lot of the
tribe of Zebulun, [Jos 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#011.md); and was
given to the Levites, [Jos 21:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#034.md); it
was not far from Mount Carmel, from whence it is described.

The king of Dor, in the coast of Dor, one,.... Of which see [Jos
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#002.md); it fell to the lot of Manasseh,
but never was possessed by them, as were not Taanach and Megiddo, before
mentioned, [Jos 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011.md) [Jdg
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#027.md),

the king of the nations of Gilgal, one; not the place where Joshua
encamped after he had passed Jordan, for that was then no city; the
Septuagint version renders it the land of Galilee; and Dr. Lightfoot (s)
is of opinion that Galilee is meant, and in the Apocrypha:"Who went
forth by the way that leadeth to Galgala, and pitched their tents before
Masaloth, which is in Arbela, and after they had won it, they slew much
people.'' (1 Maccabees 9:2)Galgala is spoken of as near to Arbel, a city
in Galilee: Jerom (t) takes this to be the same with Glagulis, which in
his time was a village six miles from Antipatris to the north.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jos 12:24</span></span>

The king of Tirzah, one,.... To what tribe this place fell is nowhere
said: Adrichomius (u) places it in the tribe of Manasseh; and so does
Bunting (w), who says of it, that it was a fair and beautiful city,
situated on a high and pleasant mountain, in the tribe of Manasseh,
twenty four miles from Jerusalem to the north: here Jeroboam had his
royal seat, and so his successors unto Omri, [Kg1
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#017); and Dr Lightfoot (x.md) seems to
suspect as if Shechem in Mount Ephraim and Tirzah were the same; for, he
says, if Shechem and Tirzah were not one and the same town, it appears
that Jeroboam had removed his court, when his son died, from where it
was when he first erected his idols; compare [Kg1
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#025.md), with [Kg1
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#017.md); and so it may argue that there
was some space between: it was, no doubt, a very pleasant and beautiful
city, as not only appears from its name, but from the allusion to it in
[Sol 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#004.md),

all the kings thirty and one: it may seem strange that, in so small a
country as Canaan was, there should be so many kings in it, since the
length of it from Dan to Beersheba was scarce an hundred sixty miles, as
Jerom (y) says; who further observes, that he was ashamed to give the
breadth of it, lest it should give occasion to Heathens to blaspheme;
for, adds he, from Joppa to our little village Bethlehem (where they
then were) were forty six miles, to which succeeded only a vast desert:
but it may be observed, that in ancient times, in other countries, there
were a great many kings, as here in Britain, and in France, Spain, and
Germany, as Bishop Patrick has observed from several writers; and Strabo
(z) testifies the same of the cities of Phoenicia or Canaan, that they
had each of them separate kings, as Joshua here describes them.
