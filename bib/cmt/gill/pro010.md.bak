### [Proverbs Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">pro 10:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO PROVERBS 10

From this chapter to the "twenty fifth" are various proverbial
sentences, without any very apparent connection or coherence with each
other; describing righteous and wicked men; setting forth their
different temper, conduct, and actions, and the fruits and effects of
them. It should be observed, that frequently in the preceding chapters
two persons are represented as women; one goes by the name of "Wisdom",
the other is called the "foolish" woman and a "harlot"; the former is
clearly to be understood of Christ; and the latter, being opposed to
him, must be antichrist, the whore of Rome, and mother of harlots: now
in the following part of this book two sorts of persons are spoken of;
the one as wise, righteous, good, &c. and the other as foolish, wicked,
&c. who are no other than the followers of Christ and antichrist; which
observation is a key to the whole book.

[Proverbs 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 10:1</span></span>

The proverbs of Solomon,.... This title is repeated from [Pro
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001.md); and very properly stands here;
since here begin those pithy sentences of Solomon, which bear the name
of proverbs; the preceding chapters being a sort of preface or
introduction to them; in which Solomon recommends the study of wisdom,
shows the profit and advantage of it, gives directions about it, and
prepares for the reception of those wise sayings that follow; which are
for the most part independent of each other, and consist generally of
clauses set in a contrast to one another, and often expressed by similes
and metaphors;

a wise son maketh a glad father; as Solomon made glad his father David:
for no doubt there were appearances of his wisdom before he came to the
throne, though greater afterwards; which made David rejoice that he was
placed on the throne before his death, to whom he had committed the
charge of building the house of the Lord;

but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother; brings grief and
trouble to her, as perhaps Rehoboam did to his mother: though all this
is to be understood conjunctly of both parents, and not separately of
each; not as if a wise son only was matter of joy to his father, who may
be thought to be a better judge of his wisdom, and more abroad to hear
the fame of it, and to observe the effects of it; or as if a foolish son
only caused grief to his mother, because more at home, and more privy to
his foolish behaviour; but as being equally joyous or afflicting to both
parents. Nor is this to be understood of such who are wise and foolish
as to their natural capacities only; but who are so in a moral sense,
either virtuous or vicious, good or wicked. Wherefore parents should be
concerned for the education of their children, whose behaviour much
depends upon it; and children for their conduct towards their parents
and in the world, since their joy and grief are influenced by it. Some
interpret the words mystically, the "father", of God; the "mother", of
the church; and, the "sons", of the children of them both: and so may
fitly describe the different followers of Christ and antichrist; the one
being wise, the other foolish; the one acceptable to God, the other not.

[Proverbs 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 10:2</span></span>

Treasures of wickedness profit nothing,.... By which are meant either a
large abundance of riches in general, which for the most part are
enjoyed by wicked men, and abused to wicked purposes, [Pro
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#004.md); or an affluence of them,
obtained in a wicked way, by fraud, oppression, and the like; see [Mic
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#010.md); Or are either not used at all,
or put to wicked uses: what are not used profit not the possessors of
them, for they are "kept to the hurt of the owners" of them; and those
which are got by ill means, or put to an ill use, "perish by evil
travel", [Ecc 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#013.md). Nor can anyone by
his riches either redeem himself or his brother from destruction, or
give to God a ransom for him; nor can he by them save himself from a
corporeal death one year, one month, one day, one hour, one moment; nor
will they be of any service to him in the day of judgment, when wrath
comes forth against him;

but righteousness delivereth from death; either that which is
righteously got, though it be ever so little, is a means of preserving
life, and keeps their souls from famishing, [Pro
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#003.md); or else what is liberally
dispensed, for alms are called "righteousness", [Psa
112:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#009.md), [Dan
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#027.md). These are oftentimes the means
of saving the lives of persons ready to perish, on whom they are
bestowed, and who will venture their lives to save their benefactors;
and such liberal persons are oftentimes blessed with long life, and are
kept alive when threatened with death, [Psa
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001.md); and though their good deeds are
not meritorious of eternal life, yet they are rewarded with it in a way
of grace, [Mat 25:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#034.md). Moreover,
righteousness may be considered as legal and evangelical; a legal
righteousness, or the righteousness of men in obedience to the law,
cannot deliver from the sentence of death the law has passed; it is not
properly a righteousness; it is imperfect, cannot justify, save, or
bring to heaven, or entitle to life; notwithstanding this a man must
die: but there is an evangelical righteousness; and this is either
imparted and implanted in men, is the new man, which is created in
righteousness and holiness; and this delivers from a moral or spiritual
death, a death in trespasses and sins men are in; for by it they are
quickened, live a life of faith on Christ, and have communion with God;
have his image stamped on them, and live to him, and to Christ, and to
righteousness, being freed from the servitude and dominion of sin;
living in which is no other than death: or this righteousness is
imputed, which is the righteousness of Christ; wrought out for them,
reckoned to them, received by them, and by which they are justified;
this delivers them, though not from a corporeal death, yet from the
sting and curse of it, and from it as a penal evil, or as a punishment
for sin: and it delivers from a legal death, or from the sentence and
condemnation of the law, and from the second and eternal death, and
entities them to life everlasting.

[Proverbs 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 10:3</span></span>

The Lord will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish,.... Or to
perish by famine: not but that good men may be afflicted with it, as
Jacob and his sons were, when the famine was in Egypt and in other
lands; and as the apostles, particularly the Apostle Paul, were often in
hunger and thirst, yet not so as to be destroyed by it; for in "famine"
the Lord redeems such from death; though the young lions lack and suffer
hunger, they that fear the Lord shall not want any good thing; at least
whatever they may suffer this way does not arise from the wrath of God,
nor does it nor can it separate from the love of God and Christ, [Job
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#020.md). Moreover, the souls of such
shall not be famished for want of spiritual food; shall not have a
famine of the word and ordinances; their souls shall be fed, as with
marrow and fatness, with the finest of the wheat, and with honey out of
the rock: the church, though in the wilderness, is nourished for a time,
and times, and half a time, [Rev
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#014.md);

but he casteth away the substance of the wicked; that which is got in a
wicked way; as sometimes he causes it to diminish by little and little;
at other times he forcibly and suddenly drives it away, and causes it to
take wings and fly away; though it has been swallowed down with great
greediness and in great abundance, he makes them throw it up again, and
casts it out of their belly, whether they will or not, so that it does
not profit them, [Job 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#015.md).

[Proverbs 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 10:4</span></span>

He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand,.... That is either
remiss in giving to the necessities of others, according to his
abilities, and as cases require; or that is negligent and slothful in
his business. Or, "that worketh with a deceitful hand"; or, "with a hand
of deceit" (u), as it may be rendered; who pretends to work, but does
not; makes a show as if he did, but acts deceitfully; or who uses many
tricking and deceitful ways and methods to live, as usually slothful
persons do. Aben Ezra observes, it may be rendered and interpreted, "he
becomes poor that makes a deceitful balance"; thinking to enrich himself
by such fraudulent practices: or, as others, "a deceitful balance maketh
poor" (w); such seldom or ever thrive, or it does not long prosper with
them who use such unlawful methods;

but the hand of the diligent maketh rich; that is, with the blessing of
God along with it, as in [Pro 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#022.md);
such who are "sharp" (x) and acute, as the word signifies; who are
careful and industrious, mind their business, and do the honest part;
these, with a divine blessing, frequently grow rich: or rather who are
like those that dig in the earth for gold, who search for it with great
eagerness and diligence; for from this root is a word often used for
gold, [Pro 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#014.md). All this is true in a
spiritual sense; such who are slothful in attendance on the means of
grace, the word and ordinances, are slack and negligent in duty, bring a
spiritual poverty upon them; and like the Laodicean church, who, through
her lukewarmness and carnal security, became poor and wretched, blind
and naked: on the other hand, such who are diligent in the use of means
are frequent at the throne of grace, forsake not the assembly of the
saints, constantly wait at Wisdom's gates; these grow rich in grace and
in all good works.

[Proverbs 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 10:5</span></span>

He that gathereth in summer is a wise son,.... Which is the time of
gathering the fruits of the earth, and laying them up against winter, as
the ant is said to do, [Pro 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#008.md);

but he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame; to himself,
and to his parents and relations. The sum of the proverb is, that, in
the time of health and youth, persons should be active and industrious
in their several callings and stations, and provide against a time of
sickness and old age; and that they should lose no opportunities,
neither in a natural nor spiritual way, of doing or receiving good.

[Proverbs 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 10:6</span></span>

Blessings are upon the head of the just,.... That seeks for
righteousness, not by the works of the law, but by faith; that lives by
faith upon the righteousness of Christ, and is justified by it, made,
accounted, and reckoned just through it; and, in consequence of his
faith, does justly, and lives soberly, righteously, and godly: upon his
"head", who is Christ, blessings are; for he is "the head of every such
man", [Co1 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#003.md); not the pope of Rome,
but Christ, is head of the church; he is the representative and federal
head of all the elect, both in eternity and time; he is a political head
to them, as a king is to his subjects; an economical one, as the husband
is the head of the wife, a father the head of his family, and a master
the head of his servants; and he is in such sense a head to them as a
natural head is to its body; he is of the same nature with them,
superior to them, a perfect, only, everliving, and everlasting head.
Upon him all the blessings of grace and goodness are; his people are
blessed with them in him, their head, [Eph
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003.md); and from him they descend to
them, the members of his body, just as the oil on Aaron's head ran down
his beard to the skirts of his garments. So in an ancient writing of the
Jews (y), this passage being mentioned, it is asked, Who is the head of
the righteous? The answer is, the middle pillar; by whom they seem to
mean a middle person, the Mediator, the Messiah. Or else, a part being
put for the whole, the meaning is, that blessings are upon the persons
of righteous ones, as the word is used in [Pro
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#026.md); the Targum renders it,

"the heads of the righteous.''

All covenant blessings, spiritual ones, such as are blessings indeed,
solid and substantial, irreversible, and for ever; particularly a
justifying righteousness, from whence they are denominated just; pardon
of sin, peace of soul, every sanctifying grace, the blessing of
adoption, and a right to eternal life: these being said to be on the
"head" of them, may denote that they come from above, and descend in a
way of grace upon them; that they are visible and manifest; that they
reside, continue, and remain upon them; that they are as an ornament and
crown unto them; and that they are a security of them that no wrath and
vengeance can fall upon them. The Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, and Arabic
versions, read, "the blessing of the Lord is upon the head of the just";
and such are all the blessings before mentioned;

but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked; that is, either his
violent dealings are open and manifest, and are a scandal to him, as
well as entail a curse on him; or rather the fruit and effect of his
violence and oppression, the punishment due thereunto, is so righteously
inflicted on him, that his mouth is stopped, and he has not one word to
say against the just judgments of God upon him, for his violent usage of
men, whether here or hereafter; see [Psa
107:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#042.md). Some render the words, "the
mouth of the wicked covereth violence" (z); palliates and excuses it,
and calls it by another name; or hides and conceals that which is in the
heart, and does not utter it; see [Pro
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#018.md). The Targum is,

"in the mouth of the wicked rapine is covered;''

as a sweet morsel under their tongue, though in the end bitterness.

[Proverbs 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 10:7</span></span>

The memory of the just is blessed,.... Men to whom he has been useful,
either in temporals or spirituals, bless him, or wish all blessings to
him while alive, whenever they make mention of his name; and after death
they speak well of him, and pronounce him blessed; for such are had in
everlasting remembrance; the memory of them is sweet and precious; their
name is famous and valuable, and always spoken of with honour and
commendation; see [Psa 112:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#006.md). The
Jewish writers take it for a command, and render it, "let the memory of
the just be blessed"; and say, that he that transgresses it breaks an
affirmative precept; they make an abbreviation of the word by the
initial letters, and join them to the names of their celebrated men;

but the name of the wicked shall rot; shall be forgotten, be buried in
oblivion, and never mentioned: and though they may call their houses,
lands, and cities, by their own names, in order to transmit their memory
to posterity; yet these, by one means or another, are destroyed, and
their memorials perish with them; see [Ecc
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#010.md); and if their names are mentioned
after they are gone, it is with detestation and abhorrence, as things
putrefied are abhorred; so they leave an ill savour behind them, when
the good name of the righteous is as precious ointment, [Ecc
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#001). It is a saying of Cicero (a.md),
that

"the life of the dead lies in the memory of the living.''

\(a\) Orat. 51. Philip. 9.

[Proverbs 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 10:8</span></span>

The wise in heart will receive commandments,.... Such who have true
wisdom in the hidden part of the heart, of which the fear of the Lord is
the beginning: these will not only, as good subjects, honour their king,
and attend to his lawful commands; and, as dutiful children, regard
those of their parents; and, as faithful servants, hearken to those of
their masters; but, as such that fear the Lord, will receive and
cheerfully obey the commandments of God and Christ;

but a prating fool shall fall; like Diotrephes, that prated against the
Apostle John and other saints. Or, "a fool of lips" (b); whose folly is
proclaimed and made known by his lips; who, out of the abundance of it
in his heart, speaks and pours it out by his lips: such an one falls
into sin and into mischief; he falls into disgrace in this world, and
into hell in the next. The Targum is,

"the fool by his lips shall be taken;''

as in a snare.

\(b\) "stultus labiis", Montanus, &c.

[Proverbs 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 10:9</span></span>

He that walketh uprightly walketh surely,.... Or, "that walketh in
perfection" (c) as the Targum. Not that walks without sin, no man does
that; but that walks in the sincerity, integrity, and uprightness of his
heart, both before God and men; who worships God in spirit and in truth,
and speaks the truth in his heart to his neighbour; who is an Israelite
indeed, in whom is no guile; who walks uprightly according to the truth
of the Gospel; who makes the word of God the rule of his life and
actions; who walks by faith on Christ, using him as the way to the
Father; believing in him for salvation; walking on in him as he has
received him, and especially dealing with his uprightness or
righteousness for his justification before God; who walks, as Christ
did, in imitation of him; who walks in love, as he did, and in all
humility, meekness, patience, and self-denial; who walks in and after
the Spirit of Christ; and in the truths of the Gospel, and in all the
ordinances thereof; and in all holy conversation and godliness, studying
to exercise a conscience void of offence towards God and men. Such a man
"walks surely", or securely, safely, confidently, as the Septuagint,
Vulgate Latin, and all the Oriental versions, interpret the word. Such
an one has nothing to fear in his walk; he walks on "terra firma", on
good ground, in a good way, which leads to life eternal: he has a good
guide, the Spirit of God, which goes before him, and will be his guide
even unto death, and lead him in the way everlasting, unto the land of
uprightness; he has a good guard about him, not only the angels of God
that encamp around him, but God himself is a wall of fire to him, and
his power surrounds and protects him; he has many precious promises to
support him; not only that the Lord will be a buckler to him, but will
withhold no good thing from him, [Pro
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#007.md); he has the gracious and
supporting presence of God, when he passes through the fire and water of
afflictions, and even through the valley of the shadow of death, so that
he has nothing to fear; and has moreover the testimony of a good
conscience; and having a good hope through grace, he "walks in hope", as
the Targum is; yea, rejoices in hope of the glory of God, and holds fast
that rejoicing to the end;

but he that perverteth his ways shall be known; who does not walk in a
plain, direct, and even path, according to the rule of the word, as the
upright man; but winds about here and there, goes into crooked paths,
walks in craftiness as deceitful workers, whose folly shall be made
manifest; though they think to hide it, and deceive men, they and their
wickedness shall be exposed, their tricks and artful methods shall be
laid open, and they be known to be what they are; if not in this life,
yet at the last judgment, [Ti1 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#024.md).
Jarchi and Aben Ezra observe another sense of the word, "he shall be
broken", and compare with it [Jdg
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#016.md).

\(c\) "qui ambulat perfecte", Pagninus, Mercerus, Gejerus.

[Proverbs 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 10:10</span></span>

He that winketh with the eye,.... The Syriac and Arabic versions add,
"with fraud". A descriptive character of a wicked man, [Pro
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#013.md); who so does, either to draw and
allure persons to go along with him, and join him in his evil practices;
or by way of scorn and contempt of others; or as a token to another of
its being the proper time to circumvent his neighbour, or do him an
injury. Such an one

causeth sorrow; to himself in the issue, however he may for the present
please himself with his evil doings; and to others, whom he allures and
deceives. The Arabic version is, "heaps afflictions" or "sorrows on
men"; whom he corrupts and draws into his evil company and conversation;

but a prating fool shall fall; or, "be taken", as the Targum; or
"beaten", as the Vulgate Latin; See Gill on [Pro
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#008.md).

[Proverbs 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 10:11</span></span>

The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life,.... Like a fountain of
living water, continually running and flowing with water, wholesome,
reviving, and refreshing; so the righteous man's mouth, out of the
abundance of his heart, overflows with good things, which minister grace
to the hearers, and are for the use of edifying; things that are
pleasant and profitable, grateful and acceptable, comforting,
refreshing, and pleasing, and which tend to the good of the life that
now is, and that which is to come;

but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked; so that nothing comes out
of it but what is pernicious and hurtful; what savours of rapine and
violence; nothing but lying and deceit, cursing and swearing, and such
like filthy and corrupt communication; See Gill on [Pro
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#006.md). The Targum is, "the mouth of the
ungodly covers injury"; which is meditated in the heart; so the Vulgate
Latin version.

[Proverbs 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 10:12</span></span>

Hatred stirreth up strifes,.... A man, whose heart is full of hatred and
malice against his neighbour, will stir up, or awake, as the word (d)
signifies, contentions and quarrels which were happily laid asleep;
these he renews by tale bearing, and whisperings, and evil surmises; by
raising lies, spreading false reports and calumnies, and by virulent
reproaches and slanders;

but love covereth all sins; not its own, but others; in imitation of the
pardoning love and grace of God, which covers all the sins of his people
with the blood and righteousness of his Son. Love spreads its mantle
over the sins of its fellow creatures and Christians, and forgives them,
even all of them: instead of exposing them, hides and conceals them;
and, instead of loading and aggravating the infirmities of others, puts
the best constructions on them, hopes and bears, and believes all
things, [Co1 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#007.md); see [Pe1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#008.md); where the apostle seems to have
respect to this passage. This is not to be understood as conniving at or
suffering sin upon others, or as contrary to Christian reproofs and
rebukes for it.

[Proverbs 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 10:13</span></span>

In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found,.... He that
has an understanding, especially of divine, spiritual, and evangelic
things, which is the pure gift of God; wisdom will be found in his lips,
his mouth will speak of it; not of mere natural wisdom, but spiritual
wisdom; of the wisdom of God in his works; of Christ, the Wisdom of God;
of the Gospel, the hidden wisdom; of inward experience of the grace of
God, wisdom in the inward part, [Psa
37:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#030.md); from his lips will drop wise
sayings, very instructive and informing; which those that seek for and
observe may find to their profit and advantage, and to the great credit
and honour of the understanding man; while the foolish man gets both
stripes and disgrace, as follows;

but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding; or,
"wants a heart" (e): that has no understanding of spiritual things in
his heart, and so utters nothing but what is foolish and wicked, and,
sooner or later, is chastised for it. The Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic
versions, read this clause in connection with the former, thus; "he that
brings forth wisdom out of his lips smites with a rod him that is void
of understanding".

[Proverbs 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 10:14</span></span>

Wise men lay up knowledge,.... Which they get by reading, prayer,
meditation, hearing the word of God, and conversation with good men:
this they lay up in their hearts, minds, and memories, that they may not
forget it, and as a rich treasure they highly value it; that they may
bring it forth at proper times, and on proper occasions, for the benefit
of others; see [Mat 12:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#035); or hide (f.md)
it; conceal it; do not boast and brag of it, as foolish men do;

but the mouth of the foolish is near destruction: who rashly and
unguardedly utters things which bring swift and sudden destruction on
himself and others; or terror and consternation, as the word (g) also
signifies. The Vulgate Latin version is, "but the mouth of the foolish
is near to confusion"; he boasts of his knowledge, betrays his
ignorance, and so brings himself to shame and confusion.

[Proverbs 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 10:15</span></span>

The rich man's wealth is his strong city,.... What a fortified city is
to persons in time of war, that is a rich man's wealth to him; by it he
can defend himself from the injuries of others, and support himself and
family in times of public calamity; for money is a defence, and answers
all things, [Ecc 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#012.md). Or his wealth
is so in his own apprehension and conceit; he puts his trust and
confidence in it, and thinks himself safe and secure by it; when he is
trusting to uncertain riches, which will fail him; these may fly away
from him in life, and leave him exposed to distress and danger; and,
however, will not secure him at death from the wrath of God and
everlasting destruction. Or he is lifted up with his riches, is in high
spirits, and despises others; thinking himself safe, as in a strong
castle, and fears nothing, distresses, diseases, or death;

the destruction of the poor is their poverty: or their poverty is their
consternation, as the word (h) signifies, it frightens them; they,
knowing their circumstances, are afraid of everybody and of every thing;
not being able to defend themselves against their enemies, or support
themselves in times of public calamity, as war, famine, or pestilence.

[Proverbs 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 10:16</span></span>

The labour of the righteous tendeth to life,.... To natural life, and
the support of it; all that he labours for is to get a livelihood for
himself and family; that is all he desires, nor does he seek great
things for himself: or to spiritual life; so his spiritual exercises in
praying, reading, and hearing the word, and waiting upon ordinances,
have a tendency to promote and maintain a spiritual life in him: or to
eternal life; not that the works of a righteous man (so the Targum,
Septuagint, and Arabic versions, render it in the plural number) are
meritorious of eternal life; for life and righteousness are not to be
had by the works of men, but by the grace of God; yet, as the righteous
man labours for the meat which endures to everlasting life, given by the
Son of God, his labour may be said to tend to life eternal, [Joh
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#027.md);

the fruit of the wicked to sin; whatever he enjoys, whether got by
labour; though the word seems purposely omitted, as some observe, to
signify that is not intended; or whether left him as an inheritance; or
whatever way acquired, lawfully or unlawfully; all his revenues and
riches, the increase of his substance and fields, are all used to sinful
purposes, to pride, luxury, and wantonness; and so tend to death, even
death eternal, the just wages of sin.

[Proverbs 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 10:17</span></span>

He is in the way of life,.... Of eternal life, which is truly, properly,
and by way of eminency, "life", [Mat
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#017.md); and which is a life of glory; a
life of perfection, of perfect holiness, knowledge, obedience, love,
peace, and joy; a life free from all the inconveniences of the present
life, animal or spiritual; a life of pleasure, and which will last for
ever: the "way" to it is not by works of righteousness done by men,
since by these the law is not fulfilled, nor justice satisfied; and
therefore no justification of life by them, or what entitles to eternal
life; it is sinful, dangerous, and a vain thing, to seek for eternal
life in this way; Christ is the only true way to it; who, by his
obedience, sufferings, and death, has opened the new and living way; and
through his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice, way is made for all
that believe in him to enter into eternal life: and such are in the way
to it who are in Christ, secretly in election, openly in the effectual
calling; when they are made new creatures, are quickened by the Spirit
and grace of Christ, and have that principle in them which is a well of
living water, springing up unto everlasting life; who have a sight of
Christ, and come unto him by faith; who truly believe in him, with which
eternal life is connected. Particularly he is in the way unto it

that keepeth instruction; the instruction in righteousness which the
Scriptures give, especially the Gospel part of them; which is an
instruction into the mind and will of God about man's salvation; into
the grace of God, as displayed therein; into the person and offices of
Christ, and salvation by him; into the doctrines of peace, pardon,
righteousness, and life, through him. Now he to whom this instruction
comes with power, and is the savour of life unto life; who receives it
in the love of it; who "observes" (i) it, as the word here used
signifies; takes notice of and follows its direction, pointing out
Christ as the way of salvation, instructing to look to him and believe
in him, and be saved; and who retains and holds fast such instruction,
and abides by it; and finds the word of the Gospel, and eats it, and is
nourished by it unto everlasting life; he is most assuredly in the way
of it;

but he that refuseth reproof erreth; that is, from the way of life. He
that rejects the counsel and advice, the admonitions and reproofs, given
in the word of God, by the ministers of it; or by parents and masters,
friends or relations, that wish him well; he wanders far off from the
way that leads to life, and goes into the paths of sin, and consequently
is in the way of death. Some render it, "causeth to err" (k); either
others, as Aben Ezra; or both himself and others, as Jarchi: and then it
may be understood of him "that forsaketh reproof" (l), as it may be
rendered; that is, that declines giving reproof, when it lies in his
way, and is his duty to do it. Aben Ezra reads this clause in connection
with the former, as said of one and the same person,

"he is in the way of life that keepeth instruction, and forsakes or
rejects the reproof of him that causeth to err.''

He that hideth hatred with lying lips,.... Or he whose "lying lips hide
hatred", which is much the same; who pretends to be a friend, and
outwardly behaves as one, but inwardly nourishes and cherishes hatred in
his heart, which he covers and conceals, till he has a proper
opportunity of showing it; as Absalom to Ammon, Joab to Amasa, the men
of Anathoth to Jeremiah, and Judas to Christ; see [Pro
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#024.md). Or, "he that hideth hatred is a
man of lying lips" (m); he is a liar, as the person next described is a
fool. And he that uttereth slander is a fool; that brings it out by
wholesale, and hides it not; who openly defames his neighbour, and in
the most public manner; and with a multitude of words detracts from his
good name, credit, and reputation, and loads him with calumny and
reproach; such a man is a fool, a very wicked man: yea, not only the
public slanderer, but the secret dissembler, who thinks himself a
cunning man because he hides himself; each of these is a fool, the one
as well as the other. Gersom thinks there is a comparison made between
the dissembler and the slanderer; the one being a liar, and the other a
fool; and that the former is more abominable and pernicious than the
latter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 10:19</span></span>

In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin,.... Where a great deal
is said, without care and forethought, there will not only be many weak
things uttered, but much falsehood, and at least many idle things, which
cannot be excused from sin; not but that much and long speaking may be
to great profit and advantage, when it is with care and judgment, and
founded on close meditation and study. Or, "sin ceaseth not" (n); along
with a torrent of words is a flow of sin, which ceases not as long as
that continues: it is a saying of the Jewish Rabbins,

"he that multiplies words brings on or brings unto sin;''

but he that refraineth his lips is wise; lays a restraint on his mouth,
bridles his tongue; does not suffer his lips to utter anything rashly
and inconsiderately; is sparing of his words and is careful of what he
says, that it is true and proper to be spoken; and considers well the
time when, place where, and persons to whom he speaks; and, all
circumstances weighed, conducts accordingly: such a man is a wise,
prudent, and understanding man; see [Pro

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 10:20</span></span>

The tongue of the just is as choice silver,.... Which utters things
precious, pure, pleasant, and profitable; things for worth and value as
choice silver; the doctrines of the Gospel, the power of which he has
felt upon his heart; the precious promises of it, which have been
applied unto him; and the rich experience of grace he has been favoured
with: things pure and incorrupt, like silver free from dross; as the
doctrines of grace, fetched out of the mines of the sacred Scripture,
free from the dross of error, without any human mixture; consistent and
all of a piece, and which tend to purity of heart and life; things the
reverse of a corrupt communication, nothing filthy and unclean; a pure
language, the language of Canaan; the language of repentance, faith, and
love, of prayer and thankfulness: things which are grateful and
acceptable, are with grace, and minister grace to the hearers; things
profitable and edifying; for the righteous man's mouth speaks wisdom,
and his tongue talks of judgment; and his lips feed many, as in [Pro
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#021.md); see [Psa
37:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#030.md);

the heart of the wicked is little worth; good for nothing, as the
Vulgate Latin version. The righteous man's tongue is better than the
wicked man's heart; there is no good thing in his heart naturally; all
manner of evil is in it, and comes out of it; no sin can be named but
what is in his heart; all that is in it is sinful; the thoughts of it,
and the imagination of his thoughts, are only evil, and that
continually; the affections are inordinate, and set on sinful lusts and
pleasures; the mind and conscience are defiled with sin; the
understanding is darkened with it, and the will is obstinate and
perverse, and bent upon it: his heart is wicked, and exceedingly wicked;
it is wickedness itself, very wickedness, desperately wicked, incurably
so without the grace of God. Such therefore know not their hearts who
say they have good hearts; and they are fools that trust in them: this
shows the necessity of regeneration, and that powerful and efficacious
grace is requisite to it.

[Proverbs 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 10:21</span></span>

The lips of the righteous feed many,.... Not their bodies; words are but
wind, and will not feed; it is not enough to say to the distressed, "be
ye warmed and filled", and give nothing; unless this can be understood
of obtaining food for others by their prayers, as Jarchi interprets it:
but the souls of many; these the righteous feed, by communicating the
spiritual knowledge and understanding of divine things they are
partakers of; by setting before them the bread of life, the honey and
milk of the Gospel, they have under their tongue; and by the good
counsel and advice, comforts and admonitions, they give them; see [Jer
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#015.md);

but fools die for want of wisdom: not a corporeal death, which is common
to men of every rank and quality; wise men die even as fools; but they
continue under the power of a spiritual death, for want of enlightening
and quickening grace, and so die an eternal death: not for want of
natural wisdom, which they may have a greater share of than those who
live spiritually and eternally; but for want of spiritual wisdom and
knowledge; the knowledge of Christ, and the way of life and salvation by
him, and the knowledge of God in Christ; and not always for the want of
the means of such wisdom and knowledge; as the Scriptures, which are
able to make a man wise unto salvation; and the Gospel, which is the
wisdom of God in a mystery; but through the neglect and contempt of
them: though sometimes men perish through want of the means of
knowledge, and the neglect of those who should instruct them, [Hos
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#006.md).

[Proverbs 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 10:22</span></span>

The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich,.... In the diligent use of
means; see [Pro 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#004.md); riches are from
the Lord, and should be acknowledged as such, and not attributed to the
industry, diligence, sagacity, and merit of men; but should be looked
upon as had through the blessing of the Lord upon the labours of men;
and when they come this way they come as a blessing, and with one: it
may be understood of being made rich in a spiritual sense; it is the
blessing, good will, and favour of God, that makes men rich in Christ;
that bestows upon them his unsearchable riches; that enriches them with
all spiritual blessings in him; that makes them rich in faith and in
good works, and with the riches of grace and of glory;

and he addeth no sorrow with it; no sorrow goes along with the blessing,
but what is a blessing itself, as one observes; riches enjoyed through
the blessing of God are not attended with that sorrow in getting,
keeping, and losing them, as the riches of wicked men unlawfully gotten
are; see [Ti1 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#009.md); for as the good man
comes by them easily, without any anxious care and sinful solicitude, he
seeking the kingdom of God and his righteousness, all these things are
added to him, over and above, without much thought about them, or
expectation of them, [Mat 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#033.md); so it
is with great delight, pleasure, and cheerfulness, he enjoys them, and
readily communicates them to others; while the wicked man is full of
anxiety, distress, and sorrow; see [Ecc
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#012.md). This is eminently true of
spiritual riches; there is no sorrow attending them; the fruit and
effect of them are peace, joy, and comfort.

[Proverbs 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 10:23</span></span>

It is as sport to a fool to do mischief,.... To do any injury to the
persons and properties of men; which shows a most wicked and malicious
spirit, a very depraved nature indeed: or rather "to commit sin" (o) of
any sort, which he has devised in his own heart; it is as a "laughing"
(p), as the words may be rendered; it is a laughing matter to him, he
commits sin, and, when he has done it, laughs at it; instead of being
ashamed of it, and humbled for it, he makes a mock at it, and a jest of
it, as well as of all religion, and of the reproofs and admonitions of
good men. Sin is pastime, he takes as much delight and pleasure in it as
men do in their sports, and commits it as openly and freely; yea, not
only takes pleasure in doing it himself, but in them that do it; see
[Pro 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#009.md);

but a man of understanding hath wisdom; to avoid sin, and not to do it,
which is true wisdom, [Job 28:28](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#028.md); for
he has, as it may be rendered, from the use of the word in the Arabic
language (q), a "bridle" or "restraint" upon him, that he cannot do
mischief and delight in it, as the fool does: or "so is wisdom to a man
of understanding" (r); that is, to do it; as it is a pleasure to a feel
to commit sin, so it is a delight to an understanding man to do that
which is wise and good; it is "meat and drink" to do the will of God,
see [Joh 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#034.md); he takes as much
pleasure in it as men can do in their sports and pastimes; he has a
truer pleasure and a better relish than they have; he delights in the
law of God after the inward man; and Wisdom's ways, or the ways of
Christ, are pleasantness to him; he runs the ways of his commandments
with great alacrity and cheerfulness.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 10:24</span></span>

The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him,.... What he dreads in
his own mind will be his unhappy case, sooner or later it comes upon
him; his fear of distresses, calamities, and judgments in this life, and
of eternal wrath and vengeance hereafter; for the most profligate and
abandoned wretches, the greatest atheists, who endeavour to work
themselves up to a disbelief of a God and a future state, have at times
their frights and fears about these things; and as are their fears of
God, so will his wrath be, [Psa 90:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#011.md).
Jarchi illustrates this in the instance of the builders of Babel, who
were afraid of being scattered upon the face of the earth, which thing
feared came upon them through and for their building of the tower; and
so it sometimes is, that the very thing which men fear comes upon them
by the means which they take to prevent it; so the Jews were afraid that
if their people believed in Jesus of Nazareth, the Romans would come and
seize their city and nation, and therefore endeavoured to persuade them
to reject him; for which rejection of him the thing they feared came
upon them;

but the desire of the righteous shall be granted; or "he shall give"
(s); that is, God shall give it; who has it in his hands or power to
give it, as Jarchi's note is: what a righteous man desires from right
principles, and with right views; what is for his own good and the glory
of God; what he asks in faith, and with submission to the divine will,
and is according to it, is sooner or later, in God's own time and way,
granted unto him: particularly his desires after righteousness; after
the righteousness of Christ, and to be found alone in that, living and
dying; after holiness of heart and life, that he might be cleansed and
kept from sin, and preserved to the coming of Christ; after more grace,
an increase of it, and fresh supplies from Christ; after more communion
with God and Christ, and conformity to them; after glory and happiness,
and a being with them to all eternity. Some understand this of the
righteous man's desire upon the wicked; that his fear might come upon
him, and the glory of divine justice appear in his swift and sudden
destruction; as expressed in [Pro
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#025.md); so Aben Ezra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 10:25</span></span>

As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no more,.... The wicked
themselves are like a whirlwind, noisy, boisterous, and blustering; such
is the man of sin, who speaks like a dragon, breathing out slaughter and
threatening against the saints; and so are his followers, fierce and
heady, and like a whirlwind, pernicious and destructive, bearing down,
carrying away, and destroying all before it; so the locusts of the
bottomless pit, under their king Abaddon, or Apollyon, the destroyer;
and all tyrannical persecutors, who are as the boar out of the forest,
and the wild beast of the field: and these "pass away" like a whirlwind,
swiftly, suddenly, and at once; now they are seen in great power and
authority, and anon they are not any more, [Jer
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#013.md); as the whirlwind, which digs up
the earth, makes a circle and buries itself in it; so the wicked dig a
pit for others and fall into it themselves, [Psa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#014.md); and as a whirlwind passes away
to the joy of men, so when the wicked perish there is shouting; as will
be at the destruction of antichrist more especially, [Pro
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#010.md); and it is in the whirlwind and
storm of divine wrath, which falls upon the head of the wicked, by which
they are caused to pass away, [Jer
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#019.md); so that they are "not": not
that they are annihilated at death, they will rise again and come to
judgment, and live in torment for ever; when they pass away, they are
somewhere; they are "not" indeed in the land of the living, in their own
houses, as formerly, which will know them no more; they are not in their
grandeur and prosperity, enjoying their riches and honour; but they are
in their own place, in hell they lift up their eyes, though they wish
they had no being;

but the righteous is an everlasting foundation; he is in a firm and
stable state here and hereafter; interested in everlasting love; in
which he is rooted and grounded; secured in an everlasting covenant,
ordered in all things and sure; having a share in everlasting salvation,
and eternal redemption wrought out by Christ; being justified by his
everlasting righteousness, which will answer for him in a time to come;
and a partaker of those graces of the Spirit, faith, hope, and love,
which are a well of living water springing up to everlasting life; and
having everlasting strength and everlasting consolation in Christ, and a
title to eternal life through him. Or, "but the righteous has an
everlasting foundation" (t); the sense is the same; which foundation is
not external privileges of birth and education, or a mere outward
profession of religion, or works of righteousness done; these are not
everlasting, but sandy foundations; but Christ is the righteous man's
foundation, and he is the only one, [Co1
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#011.md). Some take the sense to be, the
"righteous", that is, Jesus Christ the righteous, "is an everlasting
foundation"; he is the foundation of the church, the rock on which it is
built; he is the foundation of the apostles and prophets, on which they
were laid, and by whom they are saved; he is the foundation of every
particular believer, they are rooted and built up on him; he is the
foundation of their faith, hope, love, peace, joy, and comfort, and of
their eternal glory and happiness: and an "everlasting one" he is; he is
so in his person as God-man; in his offices of Prophet, Priest, and
King; in the efficacy of his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice; and is
a foundation which is sure, and will never fail: he has been the
foundation of his people in all ages; and he is the same today,
yesterday, and for ever. Hence, though the wicked pass away as the
whirlwind, and by one, the righteous shall not; they are on a
foundation, and cannot be blown off of it by the storms and tempests of
Satan's temptations, their own corruptions, the persecutions of men, the
errors of the wicked, or by the whirlwind of divine wrath and vengeance.
Some render it, "the righteous is the foundation of the world" (u); the
pillar and support of it; as the righteous are the salt of the earth,
they are the stay of it: the whirlwind of God's wrath would tear up the
course of nature, dissolve the earth, and all things in it, were it not
for the sake of the righteous; and, when they are called and gathered
in, there will be a general dissolution of all things, [Pe2
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#009.md).

"as the sour grape is hurtful to the teeth;''

sets them on edge;

and as smoke to the eye; dims the sight, causes the eye to water, and is

messenger, as the Targum explains it; who, being sent on an errand, is
dilatory, does not make haste to bring back the answer; which is very
vexatious to those that send him, raises their passions, makes them
fretful and very angry, be it on what account it will: so slothful and
unprofitable servants, to whom talents are given for usefulness, which
they hide or use not, are very provoking to Christ, and whom he will
order into outer darkness; those who have gifts for sacred service ought
not to be slothful in business, but fervent in spirit, serving the Lord,

the unalterable purposes and decrees of God, [Job

than those that fear the Lord expect to live; or longer than, according
to the course of nature, and the weakness of their constitutions, it
could be thought they should live. Long life is promised to them that
fear the Lord; godliness has the promise of this life and of that to
come; the fear of the Lord is the means of preserving persons from those
things which are pernicious to the health of men, and so of prolonging
their days; as well as it has length of days, for ever and ever, even
eternal life, annexed to it; see [Psa
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#011.md);

but the years of the wicked shall be shortened; through diseases, which
their sins bring upon them, which cut them off before they have lived
out half their days; or by means of which, their sins, they come into
the hand of the civil magistrate, and die before their time; or are
taken off in their full strength by the immediate judgment of God, as
were Ananias and Sapphira; and so they die in the midst of their days;
and before the time, which, according to the course of nature, and the
common period of life, in all human probability they might have arrived
unto, [Psa 55:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#023.md).

The hope of the righteous shall be gladness,.... Or, "is gladness" (w);
it is now attended with joy; he has a pleasure in the exercise of the
grace of hope as to future things; he rejoices in hope of the glory of
God, and is enabled to hold fast the rejoicing of his hope firm unto the
end, [Rom 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#002.md); and the issue of his
hope will be an abundant entrance into the joy of his Lord; a being
brought into his presence, in which is fulness of joy; he is not ashamed
of his hope now, and he will not be disappointed hereafter;

but the expectation of the wicked shall perish; his hope and
expectation, either of riches, and honour, and pleasure in this world,
or of a long life in it; or of happiness in the other, and of escaping
the wrath of God, and the vengeance of eternal fire; all which, being
grounded on a wrong bottom, shall be frustrated; see [Job
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#013.md).

[Proverbs 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">pro 10:29</span></span>

The way of the Lord is strength to the upright,.... Who are upright in
heart and life; who have the uprightness or righteousness of Christ
imputed to them, and right spirits renewed in them; in consequence of
which they walk uprightly, [Pro 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#009.md).
To these "the way of the Lord is strength"; both the way which he
himself takes, and the way which he prescribes and directs his people to
walk in: the way in which he walks in providence towards them is the
strength of them; he is their shade on their right hand; he shows
himself strong on their behalf; he is their fortress and strong tower,
as the God of providence, even a wall of fire round about them: and the
way he takes in the discoveries of his love; in the communications of
his grace; in the application of precious promises; by granting the
influences of his Spirit; and by leading to his Son, the than of his
right hand, made strong for himself and them, is very strengthening unto
them: so likewise the way in which he leads his people, the way of his
word and ordinances; which, as it is pleasant, so strengthening; the
more they walk in them, the stronger they are; they go from strength to
strength, they grow stronger and stronger by them; while they are
waiting on the Lord in them, their spiritual strength is renewed:
moreover, walking in the way of the Lord gives them spirit and courage,
and makes them bold and intrepid; so that they fear no enemy, nor any
dangers and difficulties, but go on their way cheerfully and pleasantly;

but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity; not to all that do
iniquity, for no man lives without sin; but to those who give up
themselves to it, make a trade of it; whose course of life is sinful,
and do nothing else but sin; this their way leads to ruin; destruction
and misery are now in all their ways, and will be the certain issue of
them, even destruction of both soul and body; which will be swift and
sudden, come upon them before they are aware, and will be everlasting;
it will continue for ever, and there will be no deliverance from it. The
Word (x) signifies terror and consternation; and such seize on a wicked
man at death, to whom death is the king of terrors; and which will still
more strongly possess him when in hell he lifts up his eyes; and also at
the day of judgment, when he shall see the Judge coming in the clouds of
heaven, sitting on a fiery throne, and shall hear him pronounce him
cursed. The clause may be rendered, but the way of the Lord is "terror
to the workers of iniquity" (y); the way of the Lord in his works of
providence, in which he oftentimes does terrible things in
righteousness; and he is very terrible to men in his judgments here, and
will be more so in his awful procedure at the last judgment.

[Proverbs 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">pro 10:30</span></span>

The righteous shall never be removed,.... They may be removed from place
to place in this world, through the persecutions of their enemies, or
through one providence or another, as they often are; they may be
removed from a state of outward prosperity to a state of adversity, as
Job was; they may be removed from spiritual and comfortable frames of
soul to carnal or uncomfortable ones; for good frames are very
precarious and uncertain things; and they will be removed out of this
world into another; here they have no continuing city: but they shall
never be removed from the love of God, nothing can separate them from
that; they are set as a seal on his heart, and are engraven on the palms
of his hands, and there is no removing them from thence; they may be
waiver about their interest in the love of God; they may be without the
manifestations and discoveries of it to their souls; they may be under
the hidings of God's face; they may be at a distance from his house and
ordinances, or may not enjoy the presence of God in them for a time; yet
not separated from his affections; they shall never be removed out of
the hands of Christ, into which they are put for security, and out of
which none can pluck them, men or devils; how should they, since they
are in those hands that made the heavens and the earth, support all in
being, and hold the reins of government? Was it possible they could be
removed from hence, it would impeach the wisdom of God, who has put them
there; argue weakness in Christ, and suppose danger to them. Nor can
they be removed out of the family of God; sons of God abide in his house
for ever; they are no more foreigners and strangers; once children, no
more servants; they may be corrected and chastised, yet be children;
they may judge themselves unworthy of the relation, and be ready to
conclude that their spots are not the spots of God's children, and fear
they are none of them, and yet the relation continues: nor will they
ever be removed from their state of justification, by which they are
denominated righteous, into a state of condemnation; for full
satisfaction is given to law and justice for them; their justification
is complete, it is from all sin; the righteousness by which they are
justified is everlasting, and even their faith which receives it shall
never fail; to which may be added, that they are secured from wrath to
come, and entitled to eternal life. In a word, they are on the sure
foundation of electing grace; they are in the immovable covenant of
grace; they are on the Rock of ages, Christ Jesus; all the divine
Persons and perfections are on their side; they are kept by the power of
God, through faith, unto salvation; see [Psa
55:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#022.md);

but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth; but a very little while, as
Gersom observes; and the time of their abode on earth is so short, as
scarce to be called an inhabitation of it. Moreover, they shall not
inhabit the earth the righteous will, even the new earth, which none but
righteous persons shall inhabit, [Pe2
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#013.md); see [Psa
37:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#009.md).

[Proverbs 10:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">pro 10:31</span></span>

The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom,.... As the earth brings
forth its increase, and a tree brings forth its fruit; hence speech is
called the fruit of the lips; wisdom is good fruit; a good man is
comparable to the fruitful earth, and to a good tree; whose mouth brings
forth wise things in abundance, which are very pleasant and profitable;
not worldly wisdom, much less devilish; not merely natural wisdom, but
spiritual and evangelical; see [Psa
37:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#030.md);

but the froward tongue shall be cut out; or "cut down" (z); as an
unprofitable tree, which brings forth nothing but perverse things;
things contrary to God and good men, to truth and right reason, to the
light of nature, the law of God, and Gospel of Christ. Such "a tongue of
perversities" (a), as it may be rendered, that brings forth blasphemies
against God, his tabernacle and his saints, as the tongue of antichrist
does, deserves to be cut out, as the tongue of a blasphemer.

[Proverbs 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">pro 10:32</span></span>

The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable,.... To God and man;
what is well pleasing to, God, and what ministers grace to the hearers,
or what is grateful: and such things they will deliver out; they are
used and accustomed to them; not only the righteous know in their
judgment what is acceptable, but they use themselves to say those
things; they not only know them in theory, but practise them: some men
know what is acceptable, but their lips do not know it; they are not
used to it, but the contrary;

but the mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness; or perverse things, as
before. Or, "the mouth of the wicked knoweth frowardness" (b); or
perverse things; or is used only to speak froward things; things
contrary to truth and righteousness, and which they know to be so; their
mouth speaks things contrary to their hearts; their hearts and mouths do
not agree, when they both flatter and lie.
