INTRODUCTION TO SECOND SAMUEL 8

This chapter gives a relation of the wars of David with his enemies, and
his victories over them, particularly the Philistines, Moabites,
Syrians, and Edomites, and of the spoils he took from them, and of the
presents made to him by others, [Sa2
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#001.md); and of his righteous
administration of government, and of the principal officers in his court
and camp, [Sa2 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#015.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 8:1</span></span>

And after this it came to pass,.... After David had rest from his
enemies for a time, and after the conversation he had had with Nathan
about building the house of God, and after the message sent to him from
the Lord by that prophet, forbidding him to build, and David's prayer to
the Lord upon it, the following events happened; and which are recorded
to show that David's rest from his enemies did not last long, and that
he had other work to do than to build the house of God:

that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them; these had been long
and implacable enemies of Israel; Samson began to weaken them in his
days; a war was waged between them and Israel in the times of Samuel and
Saul, and the battle sometimes went on one side and sometimes on the
other; but now David made an entire conquest of them: before they had
used to come into the land of Israel, and there fight with Israel, but
now David entered into their land, and took it from them:

and David took Methegammah out of the hands of the Philistines; the name
of a province in Palestine, and from the parallel place in [Ch1
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#001.md), it appears to be Gath, and its
adjacent towns; but why that was called the bridle of Ammah, or the
bridle of a cubit, as it may be rendered, is not easy to say. The
conjecture of Kimchi is, that there was a pool or river of water, so
Ammah is thought to signify; and Aquila renders it a water course, which
passed through the city, having been brought from without it into it,
the communication of which from place to place it may be David cut off,
by stopping or turning its stream; but interpreters more generally
suppose that Gath was built upon an hill called Ammah, see [Sa2
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#024.md); thought to be the same with the
Amgaris of Pliny (d) though that is sometimes read Angaris, a mountain
he places in Palestine; and that it was called Metheg, a bridle, because
being a frontier city, and being very strong and powerful, erected into
a kingdom, it was a curb and bridle upon the Israelites; but now David
taking it out of their hands, opened his way for the more easy subduing
the rest of their country: or the word may be rendered Metheg and her
mother, that is, Gath, the metropolis, since that and her daughters, or
towns, are said to be taken, [Ch1
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#001.md); and Metheg might be one of them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 8:2</span></span>

And he smote Moab,.... He next went against that, and invaded it, the
people of it being always troublesome and distressing to the children of
Israel; and though the king of it had shown some favour to David, yet it
was when he considered him as an enemy to Saul, and Saul to him; but
things having taken a different turn, his and his people's enmity
against David and his people appeared; wherefore he went and fought
them, and made them his subjects, whereby was fulfilled the prophecy of
Balaam, [Num 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#017.md); as it referred to
David:

and measured them with a line: either their country and fields, to
distribute among his people, or rather the soldiers he took prisoners;
which, as Procopius Gazaeus says, were so numerous that they could not
be told, and therefore they were ordered to lie prostrate on the ground,
and they were measured with a line, as it follows:

casting them down to the ground; or ordering them to lie down; though
some understand this of casting down their cities, towers, and strong
holds, and levelling them with the ground:

even with two lines measured he; with one, so it may be supplied, as the
Vulgate Latin:

to put to death, and with one full line, to keep alive; that is, in
measuring them with his lines, he divided them into two parts, one he
put to death, and the other, the full line, which contained the most, he
saved alive; though it seems according to our version, and so most
understand it, that David slew two thirds, and saved one, and so
Josephus (e). This must be understood of the army of the Moabites that
fell into his hands, so Josephus, who persisted and refused to submit,
not of all the inhabitants of the land. The Jews say (f), that the
reason of this severe treatment of them was because they slew the
father, and mother and brethren of David, whom he left to the care and
custody of the king of Moab, when he fled from Saul, see [Sa1
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#003.md); since after that they are heard
no more of; though it should rather be imputed to their enmity against
the people of Israel. The phrase of "meting out the valley of Succoth"
seems to be an allusion to this fact, [Psa
60:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#006.md), the psalm being written on
occasion of the victories here related:

and so the Moabites became David's servants; the inhabitants of the land
who were left in it, perhaps that part of the soldiers preserved alive
were brought home captives:

and brought gifts; paid a yearly tribute to King David, as they
afterwards did to Solomon and to Rehoboam, until the revolt of the ten
tribes, and then they paid it unto the kings of Israel, to the times of
Ahab, see [Kg2 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#004.md), though these gifts
may be distinct from, and besides the tribute paid, which is supposed in
their being servants, see [Ch2 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#011.md).
Thus the Arabians (g) carried gifts to the king of Persia besides
tribute.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 8:3</span></span>

And David also smote Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah,....
Called sometimes Aramzobah, and was a part of Syria, as its name shows.
Benjamin, of Tudela (h) takes it to be the same with Haleb or Aleppo;
Josephus (i) calls it Sophene; but that is placed by Ptolemy (k) beyond
the Euphrates; whereas this country must be between that river and the
land of Israel, and was contiguous to it, and near Damascus; and it was
so near the land of Israel, and being conquered by David, that it became
a controversy with the Jews, whether it was not to be reckoned part of
it, and in several things they allow it to be equal to it (l). Rehob was
the first king of this part of Syria, and then his son the second and
last; he is called Hadarezer in [Ch1
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#003.md); the letters "D" and "R", being
frequently changed in the Hebrew tongue: him David fought with, and
overcame:

as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates; which some
understand of Hadadezer, so Jarchi and Kimchi, who attempted to recover
part of his dominions that had been taken by some one or another from
him, which lay upon the river Euphrates; or he endeavoured to enlarge
his dominions, and carry them as far as the river, and establish the
borders of them; and while he was doing this, or attempting it, David
fell upon him, and routed him; or rather this refers to David, who
considering that the ancient border of the land of Israel, as given to
Abraham, reached to the river Euphrates, [Gen
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018.md); he set out on an expedition to
recover this border, and whereas the country of this king lay in his
way, he invaded that; upon which Hadadezer rose up against him, and was
conquered by him, and by this means the border was recovered to the
kingdom of Israel, and reached so far, as is plain it did in Solomon's
time, [Kg1 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#021.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa2 8:4</span></span>

And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred
horsemen,.... "Chariots" are not in the text here, it is only 1700
"horsemen"; but it is supplied from [Ch1
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#004.md); where the word is expressly
mentioned, and there the horsemen are said to be seven thousand as in
the Septuagint version here, and in Josephus (m); which may be
reconciled by observing, with Kimchi and Abarbinel, that here the chief
officers are meant, there all the chariots and horsemen that were under
their command are mentioned, which together made up that large number;
or else here are meant the ranks and companies of horse David took,
which were seven hundred; and these having ten in a company or rank,
made seven thousand; and there the complement of soldiers in those
companies and ranks are intended:

and twenty thousand footmen; the same as in [Ch1
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#004); and so in Josephus (n.md):

and David houghed all the chariot horses; or hamstrung them, as Joshua
was ordered to do with respect to the Canaanites, [Jos
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#006.md); he did not kill them, which
might seem cruel and unmerciful to the brute creatures, but hamstrung
them, that they might be useless for war; and the reason of it was, that
horses might not be multiplied in Israel for that purpose, that so their
trust and confidence might not be placed in them; see [Deu
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#016.md),

but reserved of them for an hundred chariots; for his own use, not for
war, but for grandeur; which accounts in some measure for the number of
chariots and horses Solomon had, [Kg1
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#026.md); the number of horses reserved is
supposed to be four hundred, four horses being used in a chariot, which
Jarchi gathers from [Ch2 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#017.md).

And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of
Zobah,.... These seem to have had no king at this time, or, if they had,
Hadadezer was their king, which is not improbable; and Nicholas of
Damascus (o); an Heathen writer, is clear for it, whom he calls Adad,
who, he says, reigned over Damascus, and the other Syria without
Phoenicia, who made war with David king of Judea, and was routed by him
at Euphrates: and he seems to be the first king of Damascus, which he
joined to the kingdom of Zobah, and all the kings of Damascus afterwards
were called by the same name; though Josephus (p), who also speaks of
Adad being king of Damascus and of the Syrians, yet makes him different
from this Hadadezer, to whose assistance he says he came:

David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men; that is, of the
Syrians of Damascus.

Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus,.... Which was
Coele-Syria, and lay between Libanus and Antilibanus, the chief city of
which was Damascus; which Curtius (q) calls Damascus of Syria, being the
head of it, [Isa 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#008.md); in the principal
places of which he put garrisons of soldiers to keep the country in
subjection to him; or he put commanders or governors, as the Targum, in
the, chief cities, and so Ben Gersom and R. Isaiah interpret it:

and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought gifts; or paid him
tribute by way of homage, acknowledging themselves his subjects:

and the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went; he covered his head
in the day of battle, and saved him from the hurtful sword.

And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of
Hadadezer,.... That were found with them, which they had in their hands;
these must be supposed to be with the principal officers of his army; or
golden chains, as Aquila, or golden bracelets on their arms, as the
Septuagint; the Syriac version is "quivers of gold", such as they put
arrows into, and so Jarchi and R. Isaiah understand it of such, and
refer to [Jer 51:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#011.md); and so Josephus
(r):

and brought them to Jerusalem; where they were laid up, and converted to
the use of the sanctuary Solomon built; see [Sol
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#004.md).

And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer,.... Which, in
[Ch1 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#008.md), are called Tibhath and
Chun, they having different names; or their names might be changed upon
this conquest of them, and the one might be the names they went by with
the Syrians, and the other the Israelites called them by; the latter is
the same with Berothah in [Eze 47:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#016.md);
and the Barathena of Ptolemy (s), placed by him near Mesopotamia; in the
Arabic version of [Ch1 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#008.md), they are
called Emesa and Baalbec, the former was a city of Coele-Syria, the
latter was at the foot of Mount Lebanon; See Gill on [Amo
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#005.md),

King David took exceeding much brass; whereby he was furnished and able
to give the large quantity he did for the service of the temple, [Ch1
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#007.md). The Septuagint version adds here
what is expressed in [Ch1
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#008.md),"wherewith Solomon made the
brazen sea, and the pillars, and the layers, and all the vessels.''

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 8:9</span></span>

When Toi king of Hamath,.... Which was another small kingdom in Syria,
perhaps lately erected to defend themselves against Hadadezer, and this
the first king of it, at least the first we hear of; his name is Tou in
[Ch1 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#009.md); where in the Targum he is
called king of Antioch. Hamath lay to the north of the land of Canaan;
See Gill on [Num 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#008), it is said (t.md)
to be three days' journey from Tripoli, and that it stands in the midway
to Aleppo, on a very goodly plain, replenished with corn and cotton
wool, but very much in ruins, and falls more and more to decay: at this
day (says my author, who travelled in those parts in the beginning of
the seventeenth century) there is scarce one half of the wall standing,
which hath been very fair and strong. The king of this place

heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer; the news of
which soon reached him, he being in the neighbourhood.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa2 8:10</span></span>

Then Toi sent Joram his son unto King David,.... Who is called Hadoram
in [Ch1 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#010.md); though the Syriac and
Arabic versions read Joram there:

to salute him: to inquire of his welfare after his fatigue in the
battles he had had with the Moabites and Syrians, and to wish him all
happiness and prosperity for the future:

and to bless him; to congratulate him on his victory, and to wish him
success in all after wars he might be engaged in; and particularly to
give him thanks for delivering him from so great an enemy as Hadadezer
had been to him, as also to bring a present to him, which is sometimes
called a blessing; see [Gen 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#011.md),

because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him; that is, David
had, which had endeared him to Toi:

for Hadadezer had wars with Toi; was an enemy of his, sought to take his
kingdom from him, and had had many battles with him: and though he could
not conquer him, he sadly harassed him, being too mighty for him:

and Joram brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold,

and vessels of brass; as a present to David, in gratitude for his
deliverance from his enemy by him, and as a token of his homage and
subjection to him; at least as a sign that he put himself under his
protection, and desired to be his friend and ally. The word "Joram",
though not in the Hebrew text, is rightly supplied; for none else can be
supposed to bring the present.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 8:11</span></span>

Which also King David did dedicate unto the Lord,.... He devoted it to
sacred uses, particularly to the building of the house of the Lord, as
he also had the gold and the brass he took from Hadadezer: together

with the silver and the gold he had dedicated of all nations which he
subdued; who are after particularly mentioned; he did not convert the
spoils he took to his own use, but observed the law God gave to the
kings of Israel, that they should not greatly multiply to themselves
silver and gold, [Deu 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#017.md). He set it
apart, and laid it up for the service of the sanctuary; and this
accounts for the abundance of gold, silver, and brass, which David had
amassed together, and left to his son Solomon to build the temple with;
see [Ch1 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#001.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 8:12</span></span>

Of Syria,.... Of Syria of Damascus, as distinct from Syriazobah,
Hadadezer was king of, after mentioned; this is omitted in [Ch1
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#011.md),

and of Moab: who brought him gifts and presents, and were tributaries to
him, [Sa2 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#002.md),

and of the children of Ammon; who very probably joined the Moabites, and
were conquered and spoiled at the same time:

and of the Philistines; when Methegammah was taken from them, [Sa2
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#001.md),

and of Amalek; for though we have no account of any war of his with that
people, since he was king, yet he doubtless had, and had been victorious
and spoiled them; see [Psa 83:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#007.md),

and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah; see [Sa2
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#003.md). These conquests of David, are
confirmed by the testimony of Eupolemus, an Heathen writer, who says
that he overcame the Syrians by Euphrates, and the Assyrians in Galadene
(or Gilead), and the Phoenicians; that he fought against the Idumeans
(or Edomites), the Ammonites, Moabites, Ituraeans, Nabathaeans, and
Nabdaeans; also against Syron king of Tyre and Phoenicia; all of whom he
obliged to pay tribute to the Jews (a).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 8:13</span></span>

And David gat him a name,.... Fame and reputation in the several nations
of the world for valour and courage, for the many and signal victories
that he obtained; the Jewish writers generally refer this to his
humanity in burying the dead bodies of his enemies slain in war, which
gained him great esteem among all, and even his very enemies; but
nothing of that kind is pointed at here, but his conquests: or "he made
himself a name"; erected a triumphal arch (b) in memory of his
victories:

when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt,

being eighteen thousand men; in the relation of this fact in different
places some difficulties arise, both as to the people smitten, and their
numbers, and by whom; in this place they are said to be Syrians, but in
[Ch1 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#012.md), and in the title of [Psa
60:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#001.md), which was composed on account of
these victories, they are called Edomites, and said to be of Edom; which
may be reconciled by observing, that the Syrians and Edomites were
confederates in this war; and that whereas the latter were auxiliaries
to the former, the whole body of the army might be called Syrians, of
which twenty two thousand were slain that were properly Syrians, and
eighteen thousand Edomites, in all forty thousand; which was a very
great slaughter: or the sense is, that when he had smitten the twenty
two thousand Syrians, and was upon the return, he met with a body of
Edomites, who came to the assistance of the Syrians, and he slew
eighteen thousand of them; and the Jews say, as Jarchi observes, there
were two battles; and if so, this would remove all the difficulties
started; as for the numbers slain, here eighteen thousand, and [Psa
60:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#001.md), twelve thousand, it is
reconciled by observing, that Abishai first began the attack upon the
Edomites, and slew six thousand of them; and then Joab fell upon them,
and slew twelve thousand more, in all eighteen thousand; in [Ch1
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#012.md), this slaughter is ascribed to
Abishai, because he began it, even the whole number; and in [Psa
60:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#001.md), to Joab, the twelve thousand
slain by him, who seconded Abishai; and the whole is here attributed to
David, because he was king, under whom Abishai and Joab served as
generals: and no less difficult is it to ascertain the place where this
slaughter was made, called "the valley of salt": it seems by our text
that it was in Syria, but in other places as if it was in Edom; see [Kg2
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#007.md); but in Edom itself is no such
valley to be found, though there is in Syria; one traveller (c) tells
us, that in the way from Aleppo to the banks of Euphrates are many
villages, among which is one of note, called Tedith, famous for a synod
held here by the Jews, in the year from the creation 3498, of which Ezra
was the scribe; when were placed the books of the Old Testament in the
order in which they now are; and near this town, he says, is the valley
of salt, memorable for the victory here recorded: others say (d) about
three or four hours' journey from Aleppo is the valley of salt, near
which is a salt spring, whose waters running over the place leave, when
dried by the sun, a great quantity of excellent salt; this salt is
thrown together in the Gabboul, or salt house; but by others (e) we are
informed, that near about an hour's distance from the city of Tadmor,
see [Kg1 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#018.md) [Ch2
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#003.md), is to be seen a large valley of
salt, affording great quantities thereof; and it is thought that this is
more probably the valley of salt mentioned here, than another which lies
about four hours from Aleppo, and has sometimes passed for it; and which
the above accounts show: but a modern writer (f), in his account of
Palmyra, the same with Tadmor, speaks of a great plain, all covered with
salt, from whence the whole country round is supplied. This plain is
about a league from Palmyra, and extends itself towards the eastern part
of Idumea (or Edom) the capital city of which was Bozra; and indeed this
valley being both in Syria, and reaching to the borders of Edom, bids
fair to be the valley here spoken of.

And he put garrisons in Edom,.... To keep the inhabitants in subjection
to him; as their forts and strong holds came into his hands, he placed
companies of soldiers in them for the said purpose; or governors, as the
Targum, men of his own nation, into whose hands he put their principal
cities, who governed them for him, and under him. Jarchi interprets it
of officers appointed to collect the tribute he exacted of them:

throughout all Edom put he garrisons; which is observed to show that the
whole country was brought into subjection to him:

and all they of Edom became David's servants; and hereby were fulfilled
the oracle delivered to Rebekah, and the prophetic blessing of Isaac,
[Gen 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#023.md),

and the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went; See Gill on [Sa2
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#006.md).

And David reigned over all Israel,.... Not only over Judah, but over all
the tribes of Israel, and over the whole land of Canaan, as promised to
Abraham, [Gen 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018.md); reaching to the
river Euphrates, as Syria did, now conquered by David:

and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people; when he
returned from his wars, he heard and tried all causes impartially,
brought before him, and gave sentence according to the law of God, and
administered righteous judgment without any respect to persons; all had
justice done them that applied unto him, whether high or low, rich or
poor; and indeed during his wars he was not negligent of the civil
government of his subjects, and the distribution of justice to them by
proper officers, in which he was a type of Christ; see [Isa
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#005.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 8:16</span></span>

And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host,.... Which was not only
owing to his relation to David, being his sister's son, but to his
promise that whoever smote the Jebusites first should be chief and
captain; that is, should have the command of the army under him; this
Joab did; and so was entitled to this office, and was put into it, and
continued in it, [Ch1 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#006.md),

and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder; of memorable events, who
kept a diary of whatsoever remarkable happened, which were digested into
a chronicle, history, or annals; see [Est
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#001.md); so the Targum, he"was appointed
over the memorials;''or book of memorials, as Kimchi interprets it; that
is, to take care of it, and see that everything worthy of notice was
inserted in it; or was "remembrancer" (g); one that put the king in mind
what was to be done every day, or in certain cases, and so R. Isaiah
explains it, the king's counsellor; some take him to be chancellor, as
Luther and others (h).

And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the
priests,.... Not high priests, as Josephus (i) suggests, for there was
only one high priest at a time; indeed there was a "sagan", or deputy
priest, on occasion; and so Abarbinel says that Zadok was the high
priest, and Ahimelech his second or deputy; but the truth of the case
was this, Abiathar was high priest only, and continued so until the time
of Solomon, when he was thrust out of his office, and Zadok put into it;
and Ahimelech his son and Zadok were the principal priests under him,
the one of the family of Ithamar, the other of Eleazar; so the Targum on
[Ch1 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#016.md) calls them "sagans", or
deputies of the high priesthood. Zadok is mentioned first, though
Ahimelech was the son of the present high priest, because he was in
great favour with David, as afterwards with Solomon, in whose days the
high priesthood was translated to him; the family of Eli being now upon
the decline, and near being removed from the high priesthood, as was
foretold by Samuel it should:

and Seraiah was the scribe; or secretary of state; in [Ch1
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#016.md) he is called Shavsha; he seems
to have had two names.

And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and
Pelethites,.... These, according to Josephus (k), were the king's
bodyguards, and this man is expressly said to be set over his guards,
[Sa2 23:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#022.md); and which some think were
of the nation of the Philistines, famous for archery, and slinging of
stones; and so the Targum renders it,"was appointed over the archers and
slingers;''so "choriti" in Virgil (l) are quivers for arrows; the great
use of which in fighting David had observed, and therefore got a select
company of these men, partly to teach Israel, and partly to guard
himself: but others are of opinion that David would never suffer such as
were Heathens to be so near his person, and therefore take them to be
Israelites; and so some Jewish writers say they were two families in
Israel; which is much better than to interpret them as others do of the
sanhedrim, and even of the Urim and Thummim, as in the Targum on [Ch1
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#017.md); See Gill on [Zep
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#005.md); and it is most probable that they
were Israelites, who were David's guards, and consisted of the chiefs
that were with him in Philistia, and particularly at Ziklag, which lay
on the south of the Cherethites, [Sa1
30:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#014.md); and so had their name from
thence; and among the chief of those that came to him at Ziklag there
was one named Peleth, from whence might come the Pelethites, and they
were all of them archers; see [Ch1
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#002.md),

and David's sons were chief rulers; princes, princes of the blood, or
"chief about the king", as in [Ch1
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#017.md); they were constant attendants
at court, waiting on the king, ready at hand to do what he pleased to
order; they were the chief ministers, and had the management of the
principal affairs at court. Abarbinel thinks that this respects not only
David's sons, but Benaiah, and the family of the Cherethites and
Pelethites, who had none of them particular posts assigned them, which
were settled and known, as those before mentioned had, but were always
near at hand, to do whatsoever the king commanded them; and which seems
better to agree with the literal order and construction of the words;
which are:

and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and Pelethites,

and the sons of David, were princes, or chief rulers; or priests, who
according to Gussetius (m) brought the offerings or presents to the
king, and did that to him the priests did to the Lord.
