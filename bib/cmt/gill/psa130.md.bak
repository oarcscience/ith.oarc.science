[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

INTRODUCTION TO PSALM 130

A Song of degrees. This psalm is by some thought to have been written by
David either when persecuted by Saul, and in great distress, and fearful
he should perish by him; or else when in great distress of mind because
of sin, after the affair of Bathsheba; and it is reckoned therefore
among the penitential psalms. Though others think it was written by
Ezra, or some other godly person in the captivity; and Aben Ezra and R.
Obadiah interpret it of Israel in captivity. The Syriac inscription is,

"one of the psalms of ascension: it is said concerning Nehemiah the
priest (or rather the prince or governor, since Nehemiah was no priest);
and it intimates in it the prayer of the martyrs.''

It may be applied to any person in distress, outward or inward; applying
to God for help and deliverance, for pardoning grace and mercy;
encouraging himself and others to hope for it.

[Psalms 130:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 130:1</span></span>

Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Lord. Out of deep waters,
out of the depths of the sea; not literally, as Jonah, who really was
there, and from thence cried unto the Lord, [Jon
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#002.md); but figuratively; meaning that he
had been in the depths of sin, or brought into a low estate by it, as
all men are: they are brought into debt by it, and so to a prison, the
prison of the law, to be under its sentence of curse and condemnation;
to a ditch, a horrible pit, a pit wherein is no water, and out of which
men cannot extricate themselves; to a dunghill, to the most extrem
poverty and beggary; to a dungeon, a state of thraldom, bondage, and
captivity; into an hopeless and helpless condition. The depths the
psalmist was now in were a deep sense of sin, under which he lay, and
which brought him low; as every man is low in his own eyes, when he has
a thorough sense of sin; then he sees himself unworthy of any favour
from God, deserving of his wrath and displeasure; as a polluted guilty
creature, loathsome and abominable; as wretched and undone in himself;
as the chief of sinners, more brutish than any man, and as a beast
before the Lord: but then, though the psalmist was in the depths of
distress for sin, yet not in the depths of despair; he cried to God, he
hoped in him, and believed there was pardon with him: or he might be in
the depths of afflictions; which are sometimes, because of the greatness
of them, compared to deep waters; to the deep waters of the sea, which
threaten to overflow and overwhelm, but shall not; see [Psa
42:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#007.md); and in such circumstances the
psalmist cried to God for help and deliverance; not to man, whose help
is vain; but to God, who is able to save, and is a present help in time
of need. Theodoret understands this of the psalmist's crying to God from
the bottom of his heart, in the sincerity of his soul; and so his cry is
opposed to feigned and hypocritical prayers.

[Psalms 130:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 130:2</span></span>

Lord, hear my voice,.... His prayer, which was vocal: God is a God
hearing prayer; sometimes his people think he does not hear them; but he
always does, and in his own time answers; for to hear prayer with him is
to answer it; which he does likewise in his own way as well as time; and
not always in the way and at the time his people would have him;

let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications; his
prayers put up in an humble suppliant manner, for grace and mercy; not
pleading merit and righteousness: these he desires God would hearken to
and hear, listen unto, bow and incline his ears, as he is sometimes said
to do; which is a wonderful instance of his condescension.

[Psalms 130:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 130:3</span></span>

If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities,.... Or "observe" (f) them. Not
but that God does observe the sins of men: he sees all the evil actions
of bad men done in the dark, which cannot hide them from him; and all
the iniquities of good men, so as to correct and chastise for them, but
not with his eye of vindictive justice. Or "keep" (g) them; should he
keep a watchful eye over them, make strict inspection into them, enter
into a critical examination of them, and of all their aggravated
circumstances; should he keep them in mind and memory, retain them in
the book of his remembrance; should he lay them up, and keep them sealed
among his stores, in order to be brought to light, and brought out as
charges another day, and to the condemnation of men; should he set them
before him in the light of his countenance, and not cast them behind his
back and into the depths of the sea; should he visit for them in a way
of wrath, or enter into judgment on account of them, with men in their
own persons; demanding satisfaction for them at their own hands, without
any regard to the sacrifice and satisfaction of his Son; all a man's
righteousness, repentance, humiliation and tears, would stand him in no
stead, would not answer for him, or atone for his sins; still his
iniquities would remain marked before God; the consequence of which
would be eternal damnation, [Jer 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#022.md);

O Lord, who shall stand? Not one; since all are sinners. The Arabic
version adds, "before thee"; in his presence; in the house and courts of
God, there to minister before him; to pray and praise, to preach and
hear: or at his bar hereafter, with any boldness and confidence; so as
to litigate the point with him in his court of judicature, before angels
and men, and so as to carry the cause; the wicked shall not stand in
judgment, [Psa 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#005.md). Or who can stand
before his vindictive justice, or bear his wrath and vengeance? No one
can. See [Nah 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#006.md), [Mal
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#002.md).

[Psalms 130:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 130:4</span></span>

But there is forgiveness with thee,.... And with God only; not with
angels, nor any of the sons of men; and which flows from his grace and
mercy, through the blood of his Son. It appears to be with him by his
promise of it in covenant; by appointing his Son to shed his blood for
it, and exalting him as a Saviour to give it; by proclaiming it in the
Gospel; and by the numerous instances of it, both under the Old and
under the New Testament. Or, there is "a propitiation with thee"; as the
Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions render it: God had found out
Christ to be the propitiatory sacrifice for sin, and the ransom of his
people; and set him forth in his purposes and decrees for that end; and
which was made known by the sacrifices of the law, typical of it; and in
the fulness of time he sent him to be the propitiation for it, and he is
become so; and has made reconciliation for sin, and reconciled his
people to God by the sufferings of death; and reconciled all the divine
perfections of justice and holiness, grace and mercy, together, in the
salvation of men; and is now an advocate the Father for them, pleading
the propitiatory sacrifice of himself before him;

that thou mayest be feared; were it not for pardon, and the hope of it,
men would be desperate; and, having no hope, would resolve upon taking
their swing of sin, and be entirely negligent of the worship and service
of God: was there no forgiveness of sin, there would be no more fear of
God among men than there is among devils, for whom there is no
forgiveness; there might be dread and trembling, as among them, but no
godly fear: yea, if God was strictly to mark iniquity, and not pardon
it, there would be none to fear him, all must be condemned and cut off
by him; but, in order to secure and preserve his fear among men, he has
taken the step he has to pardon sin through the propitiatory sacrifice
of his Son; and a discovery, and an application of his grace, teaches
men to fear to offend him; influences them to serve him acceptably with
reverence and godly fear, and engages them to fear him and his goodness,
and him for his goodness's sake, [Tit
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#011.md), [Hos
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005.md).

[Psalms 130:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 130:5</span></span>

I wait for the Lord,.... For his gracious presence and the light of his
countenance, being in darkness, as well as in the deep; for his
salvation and deliverance out of the depths of distress; for an answer
of prayer, having cried unto him for application of pardoning grace he
had some view and hopes of; and for the performance of promises the Lord
had made to him; and for eternal glory and happiness: all which are to
be patiently and quietly waited for, God having his set time to do them;
and may be confidently expected, since he is gracious and merciful, wise
and powerful, faithful and immutable. David might also be waiting for
the coming of Christ, as all the Old Testament saints did; through whom
all the above are enjoyed;

my soul doth wait; which shows that this was not mere bodily service or
waiting upon God and for him in an external way; but expresses the
intenseness of his mind, the earnest desires of his heart after God, his
affection for him, and the exercise of all other graces on him; his
whole soul, and all the powers of it, were engaged in this work;

and in his word do I hope: both in his essential Word the Messiah, who
was the Hope of Israel as well as the Saviour of them; the object,
ground, and foundation of hope, of all blessings, of grace and of glory:
and in his word of promise concerning the coming of Christ, and
salvation by him; concerning the pardon of sin through him, and eternal
life by him; as well as in many other special and particular promises
made to David, concerning himself, his family, and his kingdom. Arama
and Kimchi interpret it of the promise of deliverance from captivity
made to the Jews.

[Psalms 130:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 130:6</span></span>

My soul waiteth for the Lord,.... This is repeated for the confirmation
of it, and to show the vehement and constant disposition of his mind
towards the Lord; as well as for the sake of what follows:

more than they that watch for the morning: I say, more than they that
watch for the morning; or, "more than the morning watchers, that watch
for or until the morning" (h); than watchmen of cities, or the keepers
of the wails, as Aben Ezra; those who are upon the last morning watch,
and are looking out for the morning light; that they may go off from
duty, and lie down and sleep: or than those that sit up with sick
persons; who, being solitary and melancholy, as well as want sleep, long
for the morning, that they may have some refreshment: or rather than the
priests and Levites that watched in the temple, that waited for the
morning, that they might be relieved by others; or else than those of
that function, who were very diligent to observe the break of day, that
they might enter upon their morning sacrifices; of which are many
instances in the Misnah (i). So the Targum,

"more than they that observe the morning watches, which they observe to
offer up the morning sacrifice:''

and Kimchi's paraphrase is,

"who rise in the morning watches to pray.''

The coming of Christ is said to be as the morning; and the light of
God's countenance is comparable to the morning light; the discoveries of
pardoning grace are through the bright shining of the sun of
righteousness, and is the healing that is in his wings; and salvation
and deliverance from any distress Is light that breaks forth as the
morning: all and each of these are more desirable, and more to be waited
for, than the natural light of the morning; see [Sa2
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#004.md), [Hos
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#003.md).

[Psalms 130:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 130:7</span></span>

Let Israel hope in the Lord,.... The psalmist having himself hope in the
Lord and in his word, through a view of forgiveness with him, exhorts
and encourages others to do so likewise, even every Israelite indeed;
and such may comfortably hope in him for salvation, which was designed,
contrived, promised, and now wrought out for sinners, the chief of
sinners, and to be had freely; and the Gospel declaration is, that
whosoever believes in Christ shall be saved; as well as for the
remission of sin, which God has promised in covenant; proclaimed in
Christ, whom he has sent to obtain it, and exalted to give it; and has
declared in the Gospel that whoever believes in him shall have it; and
also for eternal life and happiness, which is the gift of God through
Christ; is in the hands of Christ, and of which the Spirit of God is the
earnest and pledge. Arguments encouraging hope follow:

for with the Lord there is mercy; which is natural and essential to him;
as displayed, is either general, and over all his works, and towards all
his creatures; or special, only shown to whom he will: this flows
through Christ, and is very large and abundant; and appears in various
instances, in the covenant, in the mission of Christ, and redemption by
him; in regeneration, the forgiveness of sins, and in salvation; as well
as it is bestowed on innumerable objects: and this nerves much to
encourage hope, since there is plenty of it, and God is plenteous in it;
and it is kept for many, for thousands, and even the vilest of sinners,
share in it; God has set up a throne of grace and mercy for men to apply
to, and he delights in showing mercy, and in those that hope in it: or,
there is "grace" (k) with him; an abundance of it in his heart; a
fulness of it in his son; and large aboundings of it through Christ, in
conversion, pardon, and other things;

and with him is plenteous redemption; the purpose of it was in him; the
scheme of it was drawn by him; the covenant of it was made with Christ;
the promise of it was published, and now the thing itself is done, and
is with Christ the author of it: and this is "plenteous", if we consider
the number of persons redeemed from among men, being such as no man can
number; what of them is redeemed, even all of them, their souls and
bodies; what they are redeemed from, from all sin, the law, its curse
and condemnation, from death and hell, from Satan and all enemies; the
several blessings included in it, or connected with it, pardon of sin,
justification of persons, adoption, sanctification, and eternal life;
the great price paid for it, the blood, the life of Christ, yea,
himself: and the large display of love, grace, and mercy, wisdom, power,
justice, and holiness, made in it. Kimchi interprets this of redemption
from Egypt, Babylon, &c.

\(k\) "gratia", Cocceius, Michaelis.

[Psalms 130:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 130:8</span></span>

And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities. The Lord shall do
it; in whom Israel is encouraged to hope; with whom grace and redemption
were; or who was appointed to be the Redeemer. Redemption was then
future, when these words were said, but certain, by the promise of God
and agreement of Christ; and would be of the whole Israel, or elect of
God; and that from "all" their iniquities, original and actual; sins,
secret and open, of heart, lip, and life: and which is no small
encouragement for Israel to hope in the Lord, for the sake of which this
is added; as well as for the further illustration of the nature of
redemption by Christ; which is complete, and now obtained, and is an
eternal one.
