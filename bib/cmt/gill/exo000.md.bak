INTRODUCTION TO EXODUS

This book is called by the Jews Veelleh Shemoth, from the first words
with which it begins, and sometimes Sepher Shemoth, and sometimes only
Shemoth. It is by the Septuagint called Exodus, from whom we have the
name of Exodus, which signifies "a going out"; see [Luk
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#031.md), because it treats of the going
of the children of Israel out of Egypt; and hence in the Alexandrian
copy it is called the Exodus of Egypt; and so the Syriac version
entitles it the second book of the law, called "the going out"; and to
the same purpose the Arabic version. The Jews sometimes give it the name
of Nezikin, as Buxtorf (a) observes out of the Masora on [Gen
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#008.md) because in it some account is
given of losses, and the restitution of them. That this book is of
divine inspiration, and to be reckoned in the canon of the sacred
writings, is sufficiently evident to all that believe the New Testament;
since there are so many quotations out of it there by Christ, and his
apostles; particularly see [Mar 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#026.md)
and that it was wrote by Moses is not to be doubted, but when is not
certain; it must be after the setting up of the tabernacle in the
wilderness; the greatest part of what is contained in it, he was an eye
and ear witness of; it plainly points out the accomplishment of the
promises and prophecies delivered to Abraham, that his posterity would
be very numerous, that they would be afflicted in a land not theirs, and
in the fourth generation come out of it with great substance. It treats
of the afflictions of the Israelites in Egypt, after the death of
Joseph, until their deliverance by Moses; of his birth, calling, and
mission to Pharaoh, to demand of him to let the children of Israel go;
of the ten plagues upon him and his people, for refusing to dismiss
them; of the departure of Israel from Egypt, and the institution of the
passover on that account; of their passage through the Red sea into the
wilderness, and of the various exercises and afflictions, supplies and
supports they met with there; of the giving of a body of laws unto them,
moral, ceremonial, and judicial; and of the building of the tabernacle,
and all things appertaining to it; and throughout the whole, as there is
a figure and representation of the passage of the people of God out of
spiritual Egypt, through the wilderness of this world, to the heavenly
Canaan, and of various things they must meet with in their passage, so
there are many types of Christ, his person, office, and grace, and of
his church, his word, and ordinances, which are very edifying and
instructing. The book contains a history of about one hundred and forty
years, from the death of Joseph, to the erection of the tabernacle.
