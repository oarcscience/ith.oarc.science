INTRODUCTION TO ACTS

This book, in some copies, is called, "The Acts of the holy Apostles".
It contains an history of the ministry and miracles of the apostles of
Christ, and is a sort of a journal of their actions, from whence it
takes its name. It begins at the ascension of Christ, and reaches to the
imprisonment of the Apostle Paul at Rome; and is a history of upwards of
thirty years: it gives an account of the first Gospel church at
Jerusalem, and of the progress of the Gospel there, and in Judea, by the
means of all the apostles, and particularly Peter, the minister of the
circumcision, and who also first opened the door of faith to the
Gentiles: it shows how the Gospel went forth from Jerusalem, and was
spread in the Gentile world, especially by the Apostle Paul, whose
companion Luke was, that was the writer of this book; for that it was
written by him is very evident from the beginning of it, it being
dedicated to the same person his Gospel is, and of which he makes
mention; and in the Complutensian edition the book is called, "The Acts
of the Apostles of Saint Luke the Evangelist"; and so the title of it in
the Syriac version is, "the Book of the Acts: that is, the history of
the blessed apostles, which my Lord Luke the Evangelist collected for
the saints". It was by him written in the Greek language; and we are
told (a), that there was a version of it into the Hebrew language, and
which was laid up in the library of the Jews at Tiberias; and is cited
by R. Azarias (b) under the name of twlweph, "the Acts": of the
authority of this book there has been no doubt, among the ancients, only
Cerinthus the heretic endeavoured to discredit it; and it was not
received by another sort of heretics called Severiani, from Severus, a
disciple of Tatian (c). It is a most excellent and useful work, showing
the first planting of Christianity, and of Christian churches, both
among the Jews and Gentiles; the spread and progress of the Gospel in
several parts of the world; what sufferings the apostles endured for the
sake of it; and with what patience and courage they bore them; and what
success attended them; and is a standing proof and confirmation of the
Christian religion.
