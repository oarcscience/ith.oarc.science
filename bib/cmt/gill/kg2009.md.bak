INTRODUCTION TO 2 KINGS 9

In this chapter we are told that one of the sons of the prophets was
sent by Elisha to anoint Jehu king of Israel, and to order him to smite
and destroy the whole house of Ahab, [Kg2
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#001.md), which being done unto him, and
the order received by Jehu, he acquainted his captains with it, [Kg2
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#011.md), who set out with him immediately
to Jezreel, [Kg2 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#016.md), where he slew
Joram king of Israel, [Kg2 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#022.md), and
Ahaziah king of Judah, [Kg2 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#027.md), and
Jezebel, the widow of Ahab, and mother of Joram, [Kg2
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#030.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 9:1</span></span>

And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets,....
Who the Jews generally say (k) was Jonah the son of Amittai:

and said, gird up thy loins; his loose and long garments about his
loins, for quicker dispatch in travelling:

and take this box of oil in thine hand; for an use after directed to:

and go to Ramothgilead; where Joram had left his army with his captains,
to keep the city from the Syrians.

\(k\) Seder Olam Rabba, c. 18. p. 47.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 9:2</span></span>

And when thou comest thither,.... To Ramothgilead; but from whence he
went is uncertain, doubtless where there was a school of the prophets,
perhaps that which was erected near Jordan, on the other side of which
lay Ramothgilead, [Kg2 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#001.md),

look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi; the same
that Elijah was ordered to anoint, but it was deferred till now, a
reprieve being granted to Ahab upon his humiliation, [Kg1
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#016.md),

and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren; the captains
of the army:

and carry him into an inner chamber; a chamber within a chamber, as in
the original; this he was to do for secrecy, that it might not be seen
what he did to Jehu; and lest he should be prevented doing it by the
captains, or be exposed to danger for doing it; since that might be
deemed treason to do what he was to do, and did, as follows.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 9:3</span></span>

Then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head,.... When in the
chamber together alone:

and say, thus saith the Lord, I have anointed thee king over Israel;
which was done, not with the anointing oil in the temple, which could
not be come by; and with which, as Kimchi from their Rabbins says, only
the kings of the house of David were anointed, and they only when there
was a division, or the crown was translated to another family, as was
the case now; but with common oil, or the oil of balsam, such as the
prophet had in his house:

then open the door and flee, and tarry not; lest he should be examined
by the captains, and come into danger; though before he went out he was
to say what is recorded in [Kg2 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#007.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 9:4</span></span>

So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramothgilead.
It is repeated, that it might be observed that it was a young man that
went, who was more fit for this service than Elisha, partly because of
his age, and partly because he would be less known; as also his age is
remarked, this being a bold and daring action in a young man to anoint a
new king, as well as it was honourable; and moreover, he was not only
one of the sons of the prophets, but was a prophet himself, though
young, and still a more fit person for such a service; though the Targum
is, a young man, a disciple of the prophets.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 9:5</span></span>

And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting,....
Either at a table, being at dinner, or at a council of war:

and he said, I have an errand unto thee, O captain; looking and
directing his speech to Jehu; or, "I have a word to thee" (l); something
to say to thee, intimating that he desired to speak to him alone:

and Jehu said, unto which of all us? not perhaps at first thoroughly
understanding who he meant; or however was willing to have it repeated
and explained, that it might be manifest to the whole company that he
was intended:

and he said, to thee, O captain; and to him only.

\(l\) "verbum mihi ad te", Pagninus, Montanus, Vatablus.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 9:6</span></span>

And he arose, and went into the house,.... Into the inner chamber in it:

and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, thus saith the
Lord God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the
Lord, even over Israel; for though they were fallen into idolatry, and
from the pure worship of God, yet the Lord had still a right unto them,
and as yet he had not wrote a "Loammi" [Hos
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#009.md) upon them; and there were many
among them which had not bowed the knee to Baal.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 9:7</span></span>

And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master,.... For Jehu was one
of Ahab's captains, as he was now one of his son's, as appears from [Kg2
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#025.md), but this was to be no objection
with him to the destroying of his house, as being an act of high
treason, since he had an order for it from the King of kings, and Lord
of lords; which otherwise would have seemed unlawful and criminal, and
what follows will sufficiently vindicate the justice of God in it:

that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood
of all the servants of the Lord, at the hand of Jezebel; who killed the
prophets of the Lord, and caused to be put to death Naboth the servant
of the Lord, and now their blood was to be avenged on her and her son
Joram, and all her family.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 9:8</span></span>

For the whole house of Ahab shall perish,.... Be cut off by death, and
that in a violent manner, not one should escape:

and I will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him
that is shut up and left in Israel; of these phrases; see Gill on [Kg1
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#010.md), [Kg1
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#021.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 9:9</span></span>

And I will make the house of Ahab, The same is threatened; see Gill on
[Kg1 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#022.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 9:10</span></span>

And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel,.... Or in the
field of Jezreel; the Targum is, the inheritance of Jezreel; this is
also threatened, [Kg1 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#023.md).

and there shall be none to bury her; or nothing of her to bury, as
Kimchi, all being eaten up but her skull, feet, and the palms of her
hands, see [Kg2 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#035.md).

and he opened the door, and fled; that is, the young man of the sons of
the prophets, as soon as he had said the above words, as he was ordered,
lest he should be taken up for a traitor.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 9:11</span></span>

Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord,.... The rest of the
captains of the army, who served under Joram as he did:

and one said unto him, is all well? one of the captains, the greatest of
them, as Kimchi; he inquired whether he brought any ill news, since he
came and went in such haste:

wherefore came this mad fellow to thee? so profane men, especially the
worshippers of Baal, as those captains might be, were wont to call the
prophets of the Lord, because of their habit, their manner of living,
and the gestures they sometimes used in prophesying, and especially
because of the things they prophesied of; and even prophets were
sometimes called so, because, in the time of their prophesying, they
appeared as madmen (m), and in a frenzy:

and he said unto them, ye know the man, and his communication; you saw
by his habit of what profession he is, and you may easily guess what he
talked of, as such men usually do, about religion, and one whimsical
thing or another, reproving men for their sins, and telling them what
they ought to do; and such like things you may well imagine he has been
talking of to me; you rightly call him a mad fellow, and you may well
suppose his discourse was agreeably to his character, and not worth
relating and hearing; this he said, to put them off inquiring any
further.

\(m\) David de Pomis, Lexic. p. 204. 3.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 9:12</span></span>

And they said, it is false, tell us now,.... They did not believe he
spoke truth, but concealed from them the real matter; which they
concluded to be of some importance, by the hastiness of the messenger,
the privacy between them, the countenance of Jehu, which discovered
thoughtfulness and concern, and the trifling answer he sought to put
them off with; all which increased their curiosity, and made them urgent
and importunate to know the truth of the matter: and he said:

thus and thus spake he to me; such and such words as above: and
particularly

saying, thus saith the Lord, I have anointed thee king over Israel; and
no doubt told them that he poured oil on his head, and anointed him, and
he might show them the oil.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 9:13</span></span>

Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under him
on the top of the stairs,.... That is, under Jehu, that he might be
raised higher, and put on an eminence above them, agreeably to the high
rank and dignity he was raised unto, and which they hereby acknowledged;
and that he might be conspicuous to others: and this was done upon the
top of the stairs, the first and highest of them, which led up either to
an upper room, or to a scaffold erected for this purpose; the Targum is,
on the degree of hours, a sun dial, a stone on which were engraven the
twelve hours of the day, and which, by the sun's shadow on it, it might
be known what hour it was; and at, or upon this stone, they laid their
clothes, for Jehu to sit upon; not their wearing apparel, but carpets,
or pieces of tapestry, or such like things:

and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king; and they might come the
more easily into such an acknowledgment of him as such, though he was
anointed by one whom they had just called a mad fellow; being not so
well affected to Ahab's family, and having a great respect for Jehu, the
chief commander of the army, and especially being under a particular
influence of the divine Providence, which moved them to take such a
step.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 9:14</span></span>

So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against
Joram,.... He and the captains with him entered into a confederacy to
depose Joram, and set him up as king:

now Joram had kept Ramothgilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael
king of Syria; having taken it, he left his army in it, under the
command of his captains, of which Jehu was the chief, to keep it from
the king of Syria; which gave Jehu a fairer opportunity, having the army
at his command, and at a distance from Joram, of forming a conspiracy
against him.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 9:15</span></span>

But King Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel,.... As is recorded,
[Kg2 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#029.md) and here repeated for the
reason above given:

and Jehu said, if it be your minds; to engage one and all, and heartily,
in this conspiracy, and to make me king:

then let none go forth nor escape out of the city, to go to tell it in
Jezreel; that so Joram might be surprised unawares, and have no
opportunity either of fleeing or of preparing for his defence.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 9:16</span></span>

So Jehu rode in a chariot,.... In great pomp and majesty as a king:

and went to Jezreel: set forward on a march thither with his captains,
and part of his army at least, from Ramothgilead; which, according to
Bunting (n), was twenty four miles:

for Jordan lay there; to be cured of his wounds, as before observed:

and Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram; see [Kg2
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#029.md).

\(n\) Travels, &c. p. 166.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 9:17</span></span>

And there stood a watchman on the tower of Jezreel,.... Who could see
afar off when an enemy was coming, and his business was to give notice
of it; and especially he was now on his watch tower, because the king
was there, and this was necessary for his safety:

and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company;
a troop of soldiers, though he did not know who they were, and to whom
they belonged, whether they were Syrians or Israelites; which was
reported to the king:

and Joram said, take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him
say, is it peace? he might fear some ill had befallen his army at
Ramothgilead, and the Syrians had got the advantage of them; or they had
made an irruption into his country, and were coming to attack him at
Jezreel; or there was an insurrection among his own people.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 9:18</span></span>

So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, thus saith the
king, is it peace?.... Are things well in the army, or any disturbance
in the kingdom? are you come as friends or enemies?

and Jehu said, what hast thou to do with peace? or to ask such a
question:

turn thee behind me; which he was obliged to do, Jehu having such a
company of soldiers with him; and this he did, that he might carry no
tidings to Joram, that he might not know as yet who he and his company
were:

and the watchman told, saying, the messenger came to them, but he cometh
not again; of this he sent word to the king what he had observed.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 9:19</span></span>

Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and
said,.... The same as the first messenger did, and had the same answer,
and was bid to do the same as in the preceding verse.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 9:20</span></span>

And the watchman told, saying, he came even unto them, and cometh not
again,.... Was detained, as the other was:

and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for,
coming nearer, the watchman could discern the manner of his driving:

for he driveth furiously; in great haste, making much speed, being a man
of a very warm and active spirit; and now being eager to come up with
Joram, and seize him unprepared, and ascend the throne; the Targum is
the reverse,

"for he driveth quietly or slowly,''being desirous of drawing Joram out
of the city, and get him into his hands, and slay him, that he might not
have the trouble of besieging the place, which was able to hold out some
time against him; and besides, he remembered the prophecy of Elisha,
that Naboth's blood would be requited in the field of Jezreel, [Kg2
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#026.md), and therefore was desirous of
drawing him out of the city, in order to slay him there.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 9:21</span></span>

And Joram said, make ready,.... The chariot, put to the horses; bind
them, as the word signifies, to the chariot:

and his chariot was made ready; by his servants immediately:

and Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his
chariot; not both in the same chariot, but each in his own, for the sake
of greater magnificence:

and they went out against Jehu; not in an hostile manner, for they had
no notion of him as an enemy; though it is much they had no suspicion of
him by his detaining the messengers; but Joram perhaps thought he was
desirous of delivering his message himself; and in honour to him, and
also being eager to know what it was, went out to meet him:

and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite; which had been his,
and where, or near it, he was stoned, and his blood shed; a very
inauspicious place to meet him in.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg2 9:22</span></span>

And it came to pass, when Joram saw, Jehu, that he said, is it peace,
Jehu?.... Have things gone well at Ramothgilead? art thou come in
triumph from thence? or obliged to fly from the Syrians? or art thou
come in a peaceable, or in an hostile manner to me?

and he answered, what peace; canst thou expect at home or abroad, from
me or others:

so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are
so many? which may be understood both literally of corporeal whoredom,
and diabolical arts she was addicted to, and figuratively of idolatry,
often called whoredom in Scripture, and of the wicked arts and methods
she made use of to inveigle and entice persons into it; and both these
very often went together; see [Nah 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#004.md)
and of which Joram was guilty, at least in part; he connived at all in
her, and did not attempt to restrain her, and therefore had no claim to
peace, protection, and safety.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 9:23</span></span>

And Joram turned his hand, and fled,.... Taking hold of the horses'
reins with it to turn them, or by the motion of it directing the
charioteer to turn them back towards Jezreel, whither he fled:

and said to Ahaziah, there is treachery, O Ahaziah; a conspiracy formed,
and rebellion raised by the captains, at the head of which he supposed
Jehu was.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg2 9:24</span></span>

And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength,.... To give the arrow all
the force he could:

and smote Jehoram between his arms; that is, between his shoulders, his
back being turned to him, and the chariot an open one:

and the arrow went out at his heart: quite through him:

and he sunk down in his chariot; and died immediately.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 9:25</span></span>

Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain,.... Not Joram's, but Jehu's
captain, though he had been the former's, and his father Ahab's also:

take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the
Jezreelite; near to which they were:

for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his
father; either in the same chariot, or on horseback side by side, his
guards or retinue following him two and two:

the Lord laid this burden upon him; this heavy denunciation of vengeance
by Elijah the prophet; and they being together, and pretty near, heard
it, as he might remember, which follows.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg2 9:26</span></span>

Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth,.... These are the
words of the Lord to Elijah the day after Naboth was put to death:

and the blood of his sons, said the Lord; who were put to death with
him, that there might be no heirs to the estate:

and I will requite thee in this place: take vengeance here, as he now
did on his son:

now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground, according to
the word of the Lord; whereby it would be fulfilled, see [Kg1
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#019.md), more is here recited than
there, which Jehu well remembered.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 9:27</span></span>

But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this,.... That Joram was slain:

he fled by the way of the garden house, which perhaps stood upon the
spot where Naboth's vineyard was, turned into a garden by Ahab:

and Jehu followed after him; as far as Samaria, where he was hid, [Ch2
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#009.md),

and said, smite him also in the chariot; this order he gave to his
soldiers, to do to him as he had done to Joram: and they did so:

at the going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam; a city in the tribe of
Manasseh, [Jos 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011.md),

and he fled to Megiddo; after he was wounded; another city in the same
tribe, [Jos 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011.md),

and died there; at Megiddo; though some think that from thence he was
had by his servants to Samaria, and there hid, and, being found, was
brought from thence to Jezreel, where he was slain, and died. Jehu was
ordered to destroy the whole house of Ahab, and Ahaziah was of that
house by his mother's side, and walked in the way of it, and was in
conjunction with it, and perished therewith; this, though here recorded,
was after the death of Jezebel, and of the seventy sons of Ahab, and of
the brethren of Ahaziah.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg2 9:28</span></span>

And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem,.... With the
leave of Jehu, because he was the grandson of Jehoshaphat, a sincere
worshipper of God, [Ch2 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#009.md),

and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David;
see [Kg1 22:50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#050.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg2 9:29</span></span>

And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign
over Judah. In [Kg2 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#025.md), it is said
to be in the twelfth year of his reign; it was at the close of the
eleventh, and the beginning of the twelfth; or he began to reign with
his father in the eleventh as here, and in the twelfth as there, when
his father was dead.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg2 9:30</span></span>

And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it,.... And of what
he had done to Joram:

and she painted her face; or put "stibium" on her eyes; a sort of paint,
to make them look beautiful perhaps the same with powder of lead ore,
the Moors now use to tinge their eyebrows with, and make them look
black, which they reckon graceful; see Gill on [Eze
23:40](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#040.md), this custom now obtains among
the white Indians, who, to heighten the lustre of their complexion, and
render their eyes more languishing, put a little black about them (n):

and tired her head; dressed her head in the most elegant manner; not
with a view to tempt Jehu, which she could not expect, being an aged
woman; but for grandeur and majesty, and in the pride and haughtiness of
her spirit, which she retained to the last, and resolved to keep up and
show in her extremity and calamity:

and looked out at a window; in a bravado, as fearless of Jehu, and to
dash him out of countenance if she could; or she might hope, by such a
graceful and majestic appearance she made, that he would be moved to
spare her life; though this does not so well agree with what follows as
the former.

And as Jehu entered in at the gate,.... Either of the city of Jezreel,
or of the king's palace:

she said, had Zimri peace, who slew his master? Elah the son of Baasha
king of Israel; no, he had not; he reigned but seven days, and, being
besieged, burnt the king's house over him, and died, [Kg1
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#010.md), suggesting that the like would
be his fate, who had slain his master Joram; or the words may be
rendered, "O Zimri, the slayer of his master"; calling Jehu so, because
of his likeness to Zimri.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg2 9:32</span></span>

And he lifted up his face to the window,.... On hearing the above words:

and said, who is on my side, who? and will assist in taking vengeance on
this haughty, imperious, and abusive woman:

and there looked out to him two or three eunuchs; who used to wait on
her, as such did on women of quality, and attend them in their
bedchambers; these, by their looks, signified they were ready to do any
thing Jehu should direct them, Jezebel having been, perhaps, a very
cruel mistress to them, and so was hated by them; and they might hope,
by pleasing Jehu, to be continued at court in their office.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg2 9:33</span></span>

And he said, throw her down,.... Out of the window upon the ground:

so they threw her down; took her up, and cast her headlong, as they were
bid:

and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall; of the palace where she
was:

and on the horses; which drew the chariot of Jehu:

and he trod her underfoot; with his horses; according to Kimchi, her
sentence, and so her death, was stoning, as a retaliation of Naboth; for
stoning was done two ways, both by casting down persons on stones, and
by casting stones upon them; see Gill on [Act
7:58](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#058.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg2 9:34</span></span>

And when he was come in,.... To the palace:

he did eat and drink; to refresh himself after so long a march, and
doing such execution:

and said, go see now this cursed woman; who had been the means of
bringing a curse on Israel through her idolatry, and upon Ahab and his
family, and upon herself, body and soul, being cursed of God and of men:

and bury her; forgetting the prophecy concerning her, though afterwards
he remembered it:

for she is a king's daughter: the daughter of Ethbaal king of the
Zidonians, [Kg1 16:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#031.md) and therefore,
in honour to royal dignity, though a cursed woman, he ordered the
interment of her; or "though" she is the daughter of one of the kings of
the nations of the world, as Kimchi, yet honour must be given to whom it
is due.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">kg2 9:35</span></span>

And they went to bury her,.... The servants of Jehu, according to his
orders and instructions:

but they found no more of her than the scull, and the feet, and the
palms of her hands; the flesh, and even all the rest of her bones, being
devoured by dogs, so that there was scarce anything of her to be buried,
as in [Kg2 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#010.md), something similar to
this happened to Ascletarion, a mathematician, as related by Suetonius
(o).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">kg2 9:36</span></span>

Wherefore they came again, and told him,.... How things were, and what
only could be found of Jezebel:

and he said, this is the word of the Lord; or the fulfilment of it:

which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying; as in [Kg1
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#023.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">kg2 9:37</span></span>

And the carcass of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field
in the portion of Jezreel,.... For upon this spot her carcass fell when
thrown out of the window of the king's palace, and here it was left; for
the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which was in the portion of
Jezreel, was next to the palace, [Kg1
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#001.md), there seems to be some allusion
to her name Jezebel, which signifies "where is dung?"

so that they shall not say, this is Jezebel; there being nothing left of
her to be seen or pointed to, nor any grave nor monument over it on
which was such an inscription, here lies Jezebel; or that might lead
posterity to say, this is Jezebel's grave. Now though the words of this
verse are not recorded elsewhere, as the words of the Lord, by Elijah,
yet as Jehu was present when they were spoken, and within the hearing of
them, he now remembered them, and could repeat them, these circumstances
bringing them fresh to his mind.
