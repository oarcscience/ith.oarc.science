[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

INTRODUCTION TO PSALM 42

To the chief Musician, Maschil, for the sons of Korah. Of the word
"Maschil", See Gill on [Psa 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md),
title. Korah was he who was at the head of a conspiracy against Moses
and Aaron, for which sin the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed alive
him and his company, and fire devoured two hundred and fifty more; the
history of which is recorded in [Num
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#001.md); yet all his posterity were not
cut off, [Num 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#011.md); some were in
David's time porters, or keepers of the gates of the tabernacle, and
some were singers; see [Ch1 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#033.md); and
to the chief musician was this psalm directed for them to sing, for they
were not the authors of it, as some (b) have thought; but most probably
David himself composed it; and it seems to have been written by him, not
as representing the captives in Babylon, as Theodoret, but on his own
account, when he was persecuted by Saul, and driven out by men from
abiding in the Lord's inheritance, and was in a strange land among the
Heathen, where he was reproached by them; and everything in this psalm
agrees with his state and condition; or rather when he fled from his son
Absalom, and was in those parts beyond Jordan, mentioned in this psalm;
see [Sa2 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#024.md); so the Syriac
inscription, the song which David sung in the time of his persecution,
desiring to return to Jerusalem.

[Psalms 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 42:1</span></span>

As the hart panteth after the water brooks,.... Either through a natural
thirst that creature is said to have; or through the heat of the summer
season; and especially when hunted by dogs, it betakes itself to rivers
of water, partly to make its escape, and partly to extinguish its
thirst, and refresh itself. The word here used denotes the cry of the
hart, when in distress for water, and pants after it, and is peculiar to
it; and the verb being of the feminine gender, hence the Septuagint
render it the "hind"; and Kimchi conjectures that the reason of it may
be, because the voice of the female may be stronger than that of the
male; but the contrary is asserted by the philosopher (c), who says,
that the male harts cry much stronger than the females; and that the
voice of the female is short, but that of the male is long, or
protracted. Schindler (d) gives three reasons why these creatures are so
desirous of water; because they were in desert places, where water was
wanting; and another, that being heated by destroying and eating
serpents, they coveted water to refresh themselves; and the third, when
followed by dogs, they betake themselves into the water, and go into
that for safety;

so panteth my soul after thee, O God; being persecuted by men, and
deprived of the word and worship of God, which occasioned a vehement
desire after communion with him in his house and ordinances: some render
the words, "as the field", or "meadow, desires the shower", &c. (e); or
thirsts after it when parched with drought; see [Isa
35:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#007.md); and by these metaphors, one or
the other, is expressed the psalmist's violent and eager thirst after
the enjoyment of God in public worship.

[Psalms 42:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 42:2</span></span>

My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God,.... Who is so called, in
opposition to the idols of the Gentiles, which were lifeless statues;
and who is the author, giver, and maintainer of natural life; and who
has promised and provided eternal life in his Son; and is himself the
fountain of life, and the fountain of living waters, and a place of
broad rivers and streams: particularly his lovingkindness, which is
better than life, is a pure river of water of life, the streams where
make glad the saints; and hence it is that the psalmist thirsted after
God, and the discoveries of his love: saying,

when shall I come and appear before God? meaning, not in heaven, as
desiring the beatific vision; but in the tabernacle, where were the
worship of God, and the ark, the symbol of the divine Presence, and
where the Israelites appeared before him, even in Zion; see [Psa
84:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#007.md).

[Psalms 42:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 42:3</span></span>

My tears have been my meat day and night,.... That is, he could not eat
for sorrow, like Hannah,

1Sa 1:7,8; or while he was eating tears fell in plenty, and they were as
common, day and night, as his food, and mixed with it (f); see [Psa
80:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#005.md);

while they continually say unto me, his enemies the Philistines,

where is thy God? theirs were to be seen and pointed at, as the host of
heaven, the sun, moon, and stars, and idols of gold, silver, brass,
wood, and stone; wherefore they ask, where was his? but David's God was
invisible; he is in the heavens, and does what he pleases, [Psa
115:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#002.md); or the sense is, that if there
was such a God he believed in and professed, and he was his servant,
surely he would never have suffered him to fall into so much distress
and calamity, but would have appeared for his relief and deliverance;
and therefore tauntingly, and by way of reproach, ask where he was.

[Psalms 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 42:4</span></span>

When I remember these things,.... Either the reproaches of his enemies;
or rather his past enjoyments of God in his house, he after makes
mention of;

I pour out my soul in me, that is, he had no life nor spirit in him, but
was quite overwhelmed with distress and anguish; or he poured out his
soul in prayer to God, that it might be with him as in times past;

for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God;
the place of public worship, whither he had often gone, with great
pleasure and delight; and, which added thereto, there were many that
went along with him; or whom he had "caused to go" (g), had brought
along with him; which is the sense of the word, only used here and in
[Isa 38:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#015.md); as Dr. Hammond from R.
Tanchum and Aben Walid, has shown: a good man will not only attend
divine worship himself, but will bring others with him: but now, he
could neither go alone, nor in company, the remembrance of which greatly
affected his mind; see [Psa 137:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#001.md);

with the voice of joy and praise: the people singing psalms, hymns, and
spiritual songs;

with a multitude that kept holy day; as especially on the three great
festivals in the year, the feasts of passover, pentecost, and
tabernacles, when all the males of Israel appeared before God together,
and which was a large multitude; and a delightful sight it was to behold
them, when they were all engaged in religious worship at once.

[Psalms 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 42:5</span></span>

Why art thou cast down, O my soul?.... The psalmist corrects himself, as
being too much depressed in spirit with his present circumstances, and
expostulates with himself; adding,

and why art thou disquieted in me? which suggests, that the dejections
of God's people are unreasonable ones; sin itself is no just cause and
reason of them; for though it is very disagreeable, loathsome, and
abhorring, troublesome and burdensome, to a spiritual man, and is
ingenuously confessed, and heartily mourned over, and is matter of
humiliation; yet no true reason of dejection: because there is
forgiveness of it with God; the blood of Christ has been shed for the
remission of it; it has been bore and done away by him; nor is there any
condemnation for it to them that are in him; and though it rages, and
threatens to get the ascendant; yet it is promised it shall not have the
dominion over the saints; neither the nature of it, being great, as
committed against God himself, nor the multitude of sins, nor the
aggravated circumstances of them, are just causes of dejection, since
the blood of Christ cleanses from all sin; nor are Satan and his
temptations; he is indeed an enemy, very powerful, subtle, and terrible;
he is the strong man armed, the old serpent, and a roaring lion; and his
temptations are very troublesome and grieving; and it becomes the saints
to be upon their guard against him and them; but they have no reason to
be cast down on account hereof; for God, who is on the side of his
people, is mightier than he; Christ is stronger than the strong man
armed, and the divine Spirit who is in them is greater than he that is
in the world: Satan is under divine restraints, and can go no further in
tempting than he is suffered, and his temptations are overruled for
good; besides, good armour is provided for the Christian to fight
against him with, and in a short time he will be bruised under his feet:
nor are the hidings of God's face a sufficient reason of dejection; for
though such a case is very distressing, and gives great trouble to those
that love the Lord; nor can they, nor does it become them to sit easy
and unconcerned in such circumstances, as they are great trials of faith
and patience; yet it is the experience of the people of God in all ages:
some good ends are answered hereby, as to bring saints to a sense of
sins, which has deprived them of the divine Presence, to make them prize
it the more when they have it, and to be careful of losing it for the
future. Besides, the love of God continues the same when he hides and
chides; and he will return again, and will not finally and totally
forsake his people; and in a little while they shall be for ever with
him, and see him as he is; and though by one providence or another they
may be deprived for a while of the word, worship, and ordinances of God,
he that provides a place for his church, and feeds and nourishes her in
the wilderness, can make up the lack of such enjoyments by his presence
and Spirit. The means and methods the psalmist took to remove his
dejections and disquietudes of mind are as follow;

hope thou in God; for the pardon of sin; for which there is good ground
of hope, and so no reason to be cast down on account of it; for strength
against Satan's temptations, which is to be had in Christ, as well as
righteousness; and for the appearance of God, and the discoveries of his
love, who has his set time to favour his people, and therefore to be
hoped, and quietly waited for. Hope is of great use against castings
down; it is an helmet, an erector of the head, which keeps it upright,
and from bowing down: it is an anchor of the soul, sure and steadfast,
and is of great service in the troubles of life, and against the fears
of death;

for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance; or "the
salvations of his countenance" (h); which implies that the psalmist
believed, notwithstanding his present circumstances, that he should have
salvation upon salvation; salvation of every kind; or a full and
complete one, which should spring, not from any merits of his, but from
the free grace and favour of God, expressed in his gracious countenance
towards him; and also intimates, that the light of his countenance would
be salvation to him (i) now; and that his consummate happiness hereafter
would lie in beholding his face for evermore: all which would give him
occasion and opportunity of praising the Lord. Now such a faith and
persuasion as this is a good antidote against dejections of soul, and
disquietude of mind; see [Psa 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#013.md).

[Psalms 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 42:6</span></span>

O my God, my soul is cast down within me,.... Which the psalmist
repeats, partly to show the greatness of his dejection, though he had
not lost his view of interest in God as his covenant God; and partly to
observe another method he made use of to remove his dejection and
refresh his spirits; and that was by calling to mind past experiences of
divine goodness;

therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan; the country
round about it, or rather beyond it; which was at the farthest parts of
the land of Canaan, where David was obliged to flee, and where he had
often met with God;

and of the Hermonites; who inhabited the mountain of Hermon; or the
Hermonian mountains, as the Targum; see [Psa
133:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#003.md); a mountain upon the border of
the land of Israel eastward, and which was very high; Cocceius thinks
the Geshurites are meant; see [Sa1
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#008.md); here also the Lord had appeared
to him, and for him; and

from the hill Mizar; or "the little hill" (k); which might be so in
comparison of Hermon. The above interpreter thinks Zoar is meant, which
Lot so called, [Gen 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#020.md); which was
near Sodom and Gomorrah: Kimchi thinks it might be Zior, mentioned in
[Jos 15:54](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#054.md); but, be it what or where
it will, in this little hill David enjoyed the divine Presence; or was
indulged with some remarkable favour; from all which he concludes he had
no just reason to be dejected and disquieted in his mind: and right it
is for the people of God to call to mind past experiences, and make
mention of them; partly for the glory of divine grace, and to express
their gratitude to God, and their sense of his goodness; and partly to
cheer and refresh their own spirits, and prevent dejection and
despondency: and delightful it is to call to mind, how, at such a time,
and in such a place, the Lord was pleased to manifest his love, apply
some gracious promise, or deliver from some sore temptation or distress:
all which must tend to encourage faith and hope. The Jewish writers
differently interpret these words; Jarchi, of David's remembrance of the
wonderful works God did for the people of Israel of old, in drying up
the river Jordan, and giving them the law on Mount Sinai, a little hill,
in comparison of some others: Aben Ezra, Kimchi, and Ben Melech,
understand them as a reason of his dejection, when he remembered how the
Israelites came from those several parts to the solemn feasts at
Jerusalem, which he was now deprived of; and the Targum paraphrases them
of the inhabitants of those places, and of the people that received the
law on Mount Sinai, remembering God; and so Arama thinks "beyond Jordan"
is mentioned because the law was given there; and by the hill Mizar he
understands Sinai: and some Christian interpreters consider them as a
reason why David's soul was cast down in him, he being in such places as
here mentioned, at a distance from his own house, from Jerusalem, and
the place of divine worship, and so render the words, "because that I
remember thee", &c. (l).

[Psalms 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 42:7</span></span>

Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of the water spouts,.... By which
are meant afflictions, comparable to the deep waters of the sea, for
their multitude and overwhelming nature; see [Psa
69:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#001.md); these came pouring down, one
after another, upon the psalmist: as soon as one affliction over,
another came, as in the case of Job; which is signified by one calling
to another, and were clamorous, troublesome, and very grievous and
distressing;

all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me: with which he seemed to
be covered and overwhelmed, as a ship is at sea. It may be observed,
that the psalmist calls afflictions God's water spouts, and "his" waves
and "his" billows; because they are appointed, sent, ordered, and
overruled by him, and made to work for the good of his people: and now,
though these might seem to be a just cause of dejection, yet they were
not, as appears from [Psa 42:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#008.md).

[Psalms 42:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 42:8</span></span>

Yet the Lord will command his lovingkindness in the daytime,.... Which
is a tender affection in God towards his people, springs from his
sovereign will and pleasure, is from everlasting, is ever the same,
never removes from them, and is better than life; the effects of which
are all spiritual blessings, grace, and glory: and this the Lord
"commands" when he sends it forth with power, makes a clear
manifestation and home application of it to them; when he commands his
covenant, or bestows covenant blessings on them; when he commands his
strength, or gives them strength to bear up under afflictions; when he
commands deliverances for Jacob, or works salvation for them; and when
he commands blessings temporal and spiritual on them, especially life
for evermore: see [Psa 111:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#009.md); and this
is done in "the daytime"; either, as some interpret it, in a fit and
seasonable time, in God's appointed time, who has his set time to favour
his people, and show his lovingkindness to them; or openly and publicly,
so as themselves and others may see the salvation of the Lord; or
continually; for mercy, goodness, and lovingkindness, follow them all
the days of their lives; yea, are from everlasting to everlasting: and
these words may be read either in the past tense, as some do, "yet the
Lord hath commanded" (m), &c. and so respect what had been, and relate
to the former experiences and manifestations of the love of God, with
which the psalmist encourages himself under his present afflictions; or
in the future, as in our version; and so they are an expression of faith
as to what would be hereafter, that the Lord would appear again, and
show him his face and favour;

and in the night his song shall be with me; signifying hereby, that he
strongly believed he should have occasion of singing praise to God in
the night season, though he was now in such mournful circumstances: he
calls it "his song"; that is, the Lord's song; because the matter of it
are his lovingkindness, and the blessings springing from it; because the
Lord himself is the subject of it; his perfections, his works, his
salvation and glory; and because he gives songs in the night, and puts
them into the mouths of his people; see [Isa
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#002.md); and the psalmist says it would
be with him, in his heart, and in his mouth, and be his constant
companion wherever he was, lying down, or rising up; and that "in the
night"; either figuratively understood of affliction and distress, out
of which he would be delivered, and so be compassed about with songs of
deliverance; or literally, it being a time of leisure to call to mind
the salvation and mercies of the day, and be thankful for them; see [Psa
77:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#006.md);

and my prayer unto the God of my life: natural, spiritual, and eternal;
being the author, giver, and preserver of each; and this is no
inconsiderable mercy, to have such a God to pray unto in a time of
distress; as well as in a time of salvation, to go to, and make known
requests with thanksgiving; which seems to be intended here, since it is
joined with a song. Prayer and praise go together, the object of which
are not lifeless idols, that cannot save; but the living God, who is a
God hearing and answering prayer, and does not despise the prayer of the
destitute. The prayer of the psalmist follows.

why hast thou forgotten me? See Gill on [Psa

why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? meaning
perhaps Saul; though it may be applied to any spiritual enemy, sin,
Satan, and the world; who are very oppressive and afflicting, and
occasion continual mourning to the children of God.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 42:10</span></span>

As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me,.... The
reproaches of his enemies were grievous and cutting to him, as if a
sword pierced through the marrow in his bones, which, being very
sensitive, gives exquisite pain. There is a various reading here: some
copies, as Vatablus observes, read "in", or with, and others "as", which
seems to be the truest; and our translators supply "as", to make the
sense, though they read "with"; but some (n) only read "as"; and the
sense is, the reproaches cast upon the psalmist were as a sword cutting
and killing; and these reproaches were as follow;

while they say daily unto me, where is thy God? See Gill on [Psa
42:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#003.md).

Why art thou cast down, O my soul?.... The same expostulation as in [Psa
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005.md); and so is what follows,

and why art thou disquieted within me? and the same argument and means
are made use of to remove dejection and disquietude;

hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise him; See Gill on [Psa
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005.md); to which is added a new
argument, taken from the grace and goodness of God, and covenant
interest in him;

who is the health of my countenance, and my God; as the bodily health of
man is seen in the countenance, and for the most part to be judged of by
it; so is the spiritual health of the saints, and which they have from
the Lord; when he, as the sun of righteousness, arises upon them with
healing in his wings, he, by his gracious presence, makes their
countenances cheerful, fills them with joy unspeakable and full of
glory, and causes them to lift up their heads with an holy boldness and
confidence, and without shame and fear: or as it may be rendered, who
"is the salvations of my countenance" (o); that is, who is or will be
the author of full and complete salvation to me; which will be so public
and open, so clear and manifest, as to be beheld by myself and others;
and this the psalmist mentions, in order to remove his present
dejections; and besides, this God of salvation he believed was his
covenant God, and would be so even unto death; and therefore he had no
just reason to be dejected and disquieted.
