INTRODUCTION TO DEUTERONOMY 26

This chapter treats of the basket of firstfruits to be brought and
presented to the Lord, and the confession to be made along with it, [Deu
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#001.md); and of the declaration to be
made on the third year, the year of tithing, and the prayer annexed to
it, [Deu 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#012.md); and of the covenant
made in a solemn manner between God and the people of Israel, [Deu
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#016.md).

[Deuteronomy 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 26:1</span></span>

And it shall be, when thou art come in unto the land,.... The land of
Canaan, which they were now on the borders of, and just entering into:

which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance; which is often
mentioned, to observe that it was not through their merits, but his
gift, that they should enjoy the land; and the rather here to enforce
the following law concerning the basket of firstfruits:

and possessest it, and dwellest therein; not only had entered into it,
but got the possession of it, and settled there. This shows as Jarchi
observes, that they were not bound to the firstfruits till they had
subdued the land and divided it; not as soon as they were in it.

[Deuteronomy 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 26:2</span></span>

That thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the earth,....
This oblation of firstfruits was different front the sheaf of the
firstfruits brought at barley harvest in the time of the passover, and
from the two wave loaves of wheaten flour, at wheat harvest, at
Pentecost; and from the cake of the first of their dough; see [Lev
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#010.md). They were of one sort only,
these of various kinds; though, as Jarchi observes, not all firstfruits,
or the first of all sorts of fruits, were to be brought; for all were
not bound to firstfruits, but the seven kinds only, called here the
fruit of the earth, and are particularly mentioned in [Deu
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#008.md); and their manner of observing,
selecting, and gathering their firstfruits, as the same writer notes,
was this;

"a man goes into his field, and sees a mature fig, he binds a rush about
it for a sign, and says, lo, this is firstfruits: and so, if he sees a
bunch of grapes, or a pomegranate, more mature than the rest, he does
the same,''as is observed in the Misnah (z):

which thou shalt bring of thy land which the Lord thy God giveth thee;
and the land being given them, and such a fruitful one as it was, they
needed not to grudge bringing the firstfruits of it to the Lord. The
quantity they were to bring is not fixed; this was left to their
generosity; but, according to tradition, they were to bring the sixtieth
part; so says Maimonides (a),"the firstfruits have no measure (no fixed
measure) from the law; but from the words of the wise men, a man ought
to separate one out of sixty:"

and shalt put it in a basket; for the more convenient carriage of them
and for the more decent oblation and waving of them together, The rich
brought their firstfruits in baskets of silver and of gold, the poor in
wicker baskets of willows barked (b). The firstfruits of the seven
several kinds were all put together in one basket, not into separate
ones, or into as many as there were kinds; but then, as the last
mentioned writer observes (c),"they did not bring them mixed, but the
barley (was put) beneath, or lowermost, and the wheat over that; and the
olives above that, and the dates over them, and the pomegranates over
them, and the figs uppermost in the vessel; and there was some one thing
which separated between every kind, as leaves, and the like; and they
put about the figs clusters of grapes without:"

and shalt go unto the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to place
his name there; which, as the event showed, was the city of Jerusalem;
hither from all parts of the country were the firstfruits to be brought.
All which may teach us, that we are to honour God with the firstfruits
of our increase; that we are to be thankful in every thing, and for
everything we have; and that our mercies should be acknowledged publicly
in the place of public worship; and that all our sacrifices of praise
should be offered in faith, which may be signified by the basket in
which the firstfruits were brought, without which we cannot please God;
and this being bore on the shoulder all the while, may denote reverence
of God, and a sense of former state and condition, as this might put the
Israelites in mind of their carrying loads in Egypt.

[Deuteronomy 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 26:3</span></span>

And thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days,.... Whose
course and turn it would be to minister before the Lord; though,
according to the Targum of Jonathan, it was the high priest they were to
apply to on this occasion; and so Aben Ezra observes, that this law is
obligatory all the time there is an high priest, as if it was not
binding when there was none, and all depended on him; who in this case
was typical of Christ our high priest, to whom we must bring, and by him
offer up, the sacrifice of praise, even the fruit of our lips, giving
thanks to God for all his mercies:

and say unto him; what follows, and the basket of firstfruits all the
while on his shoulder (d), even if a king:

I profess this day; it being done once in a year, and not twice, as
Jarchi notes:

unto the Lord thy God; directing his speech to the priest:

that I am come into the country which the Lord sware unto our fathers
for to give us; and not only come into it, but was in the possession of
it, and in the enjoyment of the fruits of it; of which the basket of
firstfruits he had brought on his shoulder was a token. The natural and
moral use of these firstfruits to the Israelites, and the bringing of
them, was hereby to own and acknowledge that God was the proprietor of
the land of Canaan; that they had it by gift from him, and that they
held it of him, the firstfruits being a sort of a small rent they
brought him; and that he was faithful to his oath and promise he had
made to their fathers, and which they professed with great humility and
thankfulness. The typical use of them was to direct to Christ himself,
the firstfruits of them that sleep in him, the first begotten from the
dead, the pledge and earnest of the resurrection of his people; to the
Spirit of God and his grace, which are the earnest of glory; and to the
first converts among Jews and Gentiles, in the first times of the
Gospel; to Christians in general, who are the firstfruits of God and of
the Lamb, and to their sacrifices of praise and thankfulness they are to
offer up to God through Christ, which are acceptable to him through him;
and whereby they glorify him as the author of all their mercies, to whom
they are to bring their best, and in the first place; see [Co1
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#020.md).

[Deuteronomy 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 26:4</span></span>

And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand,.... To wave it,
as Jarchi says, putting his hand under the hand of the owner, and so
waving it; and this being waved to and fro towards the several corners
of the earth, was an acknowledgment of the Lord being the proprietor of
it:

and set it down before the altar of the Lord thy God; that it might have
some appearance of a sacrifice, and be a fit emblem of the spiritual
sacrifice of praise, which is accepted upon the altar Christ, which
sanctifies every gift.

[Deuteronomy 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 26:5</span></span>

And thou shalt speak and say before the Lord thy God,.... Speak with a
loud voice, lifting up the voice, as Jarchi interprets it; or "answer"
(e), to the question the priest will ask, saying, what is this thou hast
brought? as Aben Ezra remarks; and this being said in the tabernacle,
and before the priest of the Lord, and as in the presence of the Lord,
is represented as said before him, which is as follows:

a Syrian ready to perish was my father; meaning Jacob, who though born
in Canaan, his mother was a Syrian, and his grandfather Abraham was of
Chaldea, a part of Syria; and Jacob married two wives in Syria, and all
his children were born there but Benjamin, and where he lived twenty
years; and sometimes persons are denominated, as from the place of their
birth, so from the place of their dwelling, as Christ was called a
Nazarene from Nazareth, where he dwelt, though he was born at Bethlehem,
[Mat 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#023.md); and Jether, though an
Israelite, as Aben Ezra observes, is called an Ishmaelite, perhaps
because he dwelt some time among that people, [Ch1
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#017.md). Now Jacob might be said to be
ready to perish when he fled for his life from his brother Esau, and was
poor and penniless when he came to Laban; so the last mentioned writer
interprets this phrase; to which may be added, that when in his service
he was exposed to cold and heat, and had his wages frequently changed,
and afterwards, when obliged to flee from Laban, was pursued by him with
an intention to do him mischief, had not the Lord prevented him. The
reason of this part of the confession was to show that it was not owing
to the greatness of their ancestors from whence they sprung, whose
condition was mean, but to the gift of God, and his goodness, that they
enjoyed the land of Canaan. So every sensible soul, when he brings his
sacrifice of praise to God for his mercies, especially spiritual ones,
frankly acknowledges his lost perishing condition by nature, of which he
is sensible; and that in order to magnify the riches of the grace of God
in his salvation, to endear Christ as a Saviour the more, and to keep
humble, and make thankful:

and he went down into Egypt; not directly, but some years after his
former afflicted circumstances; so the Targum of Jonathan expresses
it,"after these things he went down into Egypt;''after he had been in
perishing circumstances in Syria, and when he was sore pressed with
famine in Canaan:

and sojourned there with a few; with seventy souls, as Jarchi:

and became there a great nation, mighty and populous; insomuch that the
king of Egypt was jealous of them, lest through their strength and
numbers they should get away from them, when any favourable incident
happened; they being when they came out from thence six hundred thousand
men able to bear arms, besides women and children.

[Deuteronomy 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 26:6</span></span>

And the Egyptians evil entreated us,.... Ordered their male children to
be killed by the midwives, and by another edict to be drowned by the
people:

and afflicted us; by setting taskmasters over them, who put heavy
burdens upon them:

and laid upon us hard bondage; in mortar and brick, and all manner of
field service, in which they made them serve with rigour, and whereby
their lives were made bitter; see [Exo
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#009.md).

[Deuteronomy 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 26:7</span></span>

And when we cried unto the Lord our God,.... As they did by reason of
their hard bondage, [Exo 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#023.md),

and the Lord heard our voice, and looked upon our affliction, and our
labour, and our oppression; with a look of pity and compassion, heard
their cries, answered their petitions, and sent them a deliverer, [Exo
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#025.md).

[Deuteronomy 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 26:8</span></span>

And the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt,.... After some time:

with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm; by his almighty power,
of which full proof was given by what he then did, [Deu
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#015.md),

and with great terribleness: to Pharaoh and his people, through the
plagues that were inflicted on them, especially the last, the slaying of
their firstborn; see [Deu 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#034.md),

and with signs and with wonders; wrought by the hands of Moses and
Aaron, meaning the ten plagues, often so called.

[Deuteronomy 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 26:9</span></span>

And he hath brought us unto this place,.... After forty years travel
through the wilderness:

and hath given us this land, even a land that floweth with milk and
honey; an usual description of the land of Canaan, because of the great
fertility of it, and the abundance of good things in it; see [Exo
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#008.md).

[Deuteronomy 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 26:10</span></span>

And now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land,

which thou, O Lord, hast given me,.... Directing his speech not to the
priest, but to the Lord himself; owning that the part of the land he
had, and the fruits he enjoyed, were the gifts of God to him, and
therefore, as in gratitude bound, brought him the firstfruits:

and thou shalt set it before the Lord thy God; these are the words of
Moses, or of the law, directing the man what further he had to do; and
this, as Jarchi thinks, shows that he took it after the priest waved it,
and laid hold on it with his hand while he was reading (his confession),
turning and waving:

and worship before the Lord thy God; bow before him in a reverend and
humble manner, sensible of his obligations to him, and dependence on
him.

[Deuteronomy 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 26:11</span></span>

And thou shalt rejoice in every good thing,.... In all the blessings of
goodness and mercies of life, which God in his kind providence had
favoured them with:

which the Lord thy God hath given unto thee, and unto thine house; to
them and their families, by which they were comfortably provided for:

thou and the Levite, and the stranger that is among you; by which it
seems that not only a basket of firstfruits was brought and presented to
the Lord, which is the perquisite of the priest, but there were others
also brought, or bought with their money at Jerusalem, and a sort of a
kept, which the Levite, and stranger or proselyte, of along with the
owner; see [Deu 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#011.md); though Jarchi
understands it of the Levite and stranger being obliged to bring the
firstfruits: the Levite, he says, is bound to the firstfruits of the
plants in the midst of his cities, though he had no part in the division
of the land; and the same writer says, the stranger brings the
firstfruits, but does not proclaim, because he cannot say, "which he
sware to our fathers", [Deu 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#003.md); but
it is said (f), if his mother was an Israelitess he might proclaim; yea,
Maimonides (g) says, on account of what is said of Abraham, [Gen
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#005.md); who is the father of the whole
world; see [Rom 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#010.md); because mention
is made of rejoicing; hence it is concluded, as Jarchi says, that the
proclamation of the firstfruits was only made in the time of joy, from
Pentecost unto the feast that a man gathers in his increase, and his
fruits, and his wine, and his oil; though from that feast and onward he
may bring, but not proclaim; to the same purpose, says the Misnah (h),
from Pentecost to the feast of tabernacles a man may bring the
firstfruits, and proclaim; and even from the feast of tabernacles to the
dedication of the temple, he may bring, but not proclaim; the reason
given in Siphri (i) is, because proclamation is only to be performed in
time of joy--and the joy of the year is finished at the end of the feast
of tabernacles, as in [Lev 23:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#040.md).

[Deuteronomy 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 26:12</span></span>

When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine
increase,.... Which, according to Maimonides (k), is to be understood of
the feast, in which all tithes are finished, which is the feast of the
passover:

the third year, which is the year of tithing; that is, the third from
every seventh, when the land lay fallow. Every year a tithe was paid to
the Levites; and besides that a second tithe, which was carried to
Jerusalem and eaten there; and every third year it was eaten at home, in
their towns and cities in the country instead of it, with the Levite,
poor and stranger, and was called the poor's tithe; and hence the Targum
of Jonathan here calls this year the year of the poor's tithe, as was
also the sixth year, and was reckoned not complete till the passover in
the following year, as the Jewish writers (l) say:

and hath given it unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the
widow; that is, the poor's tithe of the third year, which these were to
eat of with the owner, [Deu 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#028.md);
though the Jews commonly distinguish the Levite from the rest, and
suppose that both first and second tithes are meant, the one to be given
to the former, and the other to the latter; so the Targum of Jonathan
and Jarchi:

that they may eat within thy gates, and be filled: for this was a
considerable entertainment, a sort of a feast, a full meal, however;
hence it is concluded, as Jarchi says, that they did not give less of
corn to a poor man than half a kab of wheat, which was above three
pints.

[Deuteronomy 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 26:13</span></span>

Then thou shalt say before the Lord thy God,.... Make the following
declaration as in his presence; for this was not made in the tabernacle
or temple at, Jerusalem, since the tithe was to be eaten with the poor
in the gates of the owner, as in [Deu
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#012.md),

I have brought away the hallowed things out of mine house: which Aben
Ezra and Onkelos interpret of the tithe; but it seems, besides that, to
take in everything devoted to all holy uses, be they what they will,
which were at this time to be separated from a man's own common goods,
and applied to the purposes for which they were designed and devoted,
and particularly what was to be given to the poor:

and also have, given them unto the Levite, and unto the stranger, to the
fatherless, and to the widow, according to all thy commandments which
thou hast commanded me; giving to each according as the law directs;
which the Targum of Jonathan and Jarchi interpret as before, giving the
first tithe to the Levites, and the second tithe to the rest:

I have not transgressed thy commandments, neither have I forgotten them:
neither broken them wilfully, nor omitted them through carelessness,
negligence, and forgetfulness, but was mindful to observe them
punctually and exactly.

[Deuteronomy 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 26:14</span></span>

I have not eaten thereof in my mourning,.... When in grief and sorrow on
account of any afflictive circumstance, for these were to be eaten with
joy, [Deu 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#011.md); and especially of the
loss of relations by death, when holy things were not to be eaten by
such persons; see [Lev 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#019.md); and
particularly tithes, though it is said (n),"What is doubtful of tithing
(whether it has been tithed or no) might be eaten by a mourner;''and a
man was reckoned such an one until his dead was buried. So Maimonides
(o) observes,"a mourner may not eat holy things, as it is written, [Deu
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#014.md); he is one whose relation is
dead, when he is obliged to mourn; for he is called by the law a mourner
as long as the dead lies upon the face of the earth (above ground), or
as long as he is not yet buried he is called a mourner; and so likewise
on the day of burial:"

neither have I taken away ought thereof for any unclean use; or common
use, or any other use than it was designed for, and devoted to; or for
any unclean person, who by the law might not eat thereof; or, as Jarchi
interprets it, that he had not removed it, or taken it away from being
eaten, on account of any unclean person, because I am unclean and he
pure, or he pure and I unclean:

nor given ought thereof for the dead; for the necessities of the dead,
as Aben Ezra; more particularly Jarchi, to make for him a coffin and
grave clothes; and so the Targum of Jonathan interprets it of grave
clothes for the dead; though that of Jerusalem of clothes for those that
are polluted by the dead. It may have respect also to the parentalia, or
funeral feasts made at the interment of the dead; though Aben Ezra says,
there are some that say it was for idolatry, and so the person here
speaking denies that he had made use of any of the holy things in honour
of idols, of dead men deified; and some are of opinion that all the
above things may have some respect to idolatrous practices (p):

but I have hearkened to the voice of the Lord my God, and have done
according to all that thou hast commanded me; observed his word, and
kept close to it, and not swerved from it, but acted according to it in
all things before referred to.

Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven,.... This is a prayer of
the person that makes the above declaration annexed to it, desiring that
God would vouchsafe to look with an eye of love, complacency, and
delight, upon him and upon all his people, from heaven his holy
habitation, though they were on earth, and unholy persons in themselves,
and especially if compared with him; see [Isa
57:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#015.md),

and bless thy people Israel; with blessings temporal and spiritual:

and the land which thou hast given us; with fertility and plenty of all
good things, that it might be

as thou swarest to our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey; See
Gill on [Deu 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#009.md).

[Deuteronomy 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 26:16</span></span>

This day the Lord thy God hath commanded thee to do these statutes and
judgments,.... These are the words of Moses, as Aben Ezra rightly
observes, and refer not only to the laws last mentioned, but to all
others which he had repeated, or the Lord by him had ordered to be
observed, recorded in this book: and though it is very probable Moses
had been several days repeating former laws, and acquainting them with
new ones; yet this being the last day, in which the whole account was
finished, they are said to be commanded that day, and though commanded
that day were to be observed and done every day; for, as Jarchi says,
every day was to be considered and reckoned as new, as if on that day
they were commanded them:

thou shall therefore keep and do them with all thy heart, and with all
thy soul; cordially, readily, willingly, sincerely, constantly, and to
the utmost of their abilities.

[Deuteronomy 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 26:17</span></span>

Thou hast avouched the Lord this day to be thy God,.... Said, affirmed,
protested, and in the most solemn manner declared, that the Lord was
their God, and him only; and that they would have no other God, nor
worship, serve, or obey any other. The Lord is the God of all mankind,
as he is the Creator and Preserver of them, and was of the people of
Israel in a peculiar manner, they being chosen, redeemed, and privileged
by him above all others; and especially is of his elect in Christ among
all nations, whom he has loved and set apart for himself, and determined
to save; whom he has adopted and regenerated; he provides for them,
protects and preserves them, gives them grace here and glory hereafter:
he is their God in Christ, and by virtue of the covenant of his grace
made with them in him; and is known by them to be so in the effectual
calling by the application of covenant blessings to them; and which is
certified to them by the Spirit of God, upon which they claim their
interest in him, and make profession of him as their God:

and to walk in his ways, and to keep his statutes and his commandments,
and his judgments, and to hearken unto his voice; that is, this was then
their resolution and determination, their protestation and declaration,
to walk in all the ways of God, both in private and in public, he
directed unto; and to observe all his laws, ceremonial, moral, and
judicial, which he had given them as the rule of their walk and
behaviour; and to regard whatsoever he should reveal by his prophets and
ministers as his will; and a view of covenant interest in God lays all
good men under the strongest obligation in the strength of divine grace
to attend to his will; nor can there be a greater motive to them than
covenant love, grace, and mercy.

[Deuteronomy 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 26:18</span></span>

And the Lord hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people,....
Affirmed and declared them to be his special people, above all people on
the face of the earth, and that they were looked upon and considered by
him as his jewels, his peculiar treasure:

as he hath promised thee; on condition of their obedience to him, as he
did in [Exo 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005.md),

and that thou shouldest keep all his commandments; at the same time
declared this as his will, that they should observe all his precepts, to
which they were laid under obligation by the special favour and peculiar
privileges he bestowed upon them, [Deu
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#006.md). The Targums interpret both these
verses of the people of Israel choosing and making the Lord their King,
and of his being made King over them; and so it respects their peculiar
form of civil government, being a theocracy. The Lord's people in Christ
are a peculiar people; they are distinct from all people, and are
peculiarly regarded by him; they are the objects of his peculiar love,
and receive peculiar favours from him; and whom having chosen and
redeemed, he calls by his special grace, and witnesses their special
relation to him by his Spirit; which grace obliges and excites them to a
cheerful obedience to his commands.

[Deuteronomy 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 26:19</span></span>

To make thee high above all nations,.... None of them having the Lord to
be their God and King in such sense as Israel, nor they his people in
such a peculiar sense as they were; nor having such laws and statutes as
he had given to them; these things gave them a superiority over all
other nations:

which he hath made, in praise, and in name, and in honour; that is,
which nations he made praiseworthy, famous, and honourable, for their
extent, wealth, riches, and number; and yet on the above accounts Israel
was advanced higher than they:

and that thou mayest be an holy people unto the Lord thy God, as he hath
spoken; the end of the Lord in being their God, and making them his
people, was not only to make them high above all others, but to make
them more holy than others; to set them apart for himself, as a people
sacred to his worship and service, as he had both determined and
declared, [Deu 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#006.md).
