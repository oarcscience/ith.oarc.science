[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

INTRODUCTION TO PSALM 19

To the chief Musician, a Psalm of David. This psalm was penned by David,
and inscribed to the chief musician, as others, to be used in public
service, and was designed for Gospel times, as the subject of it shows;
which is first, not an account of the light of nature, and then of the
law of Moses, but of the Gospel of Christ; and especially as ministered
in the times of the apostles, as a citation out of it in [Rom
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#018.md), makes clear.

[Psalms 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 19:1</span></span>

The heavens declare the glory of God,.... By which we are to understand
not the heavens literally taken, though these with the firmament are the
handiworks of God, and do declare the glory of his perfections,
especially his wisdom and power; these show that there is a God, and
that he is a glorious one: but either Gospel churches, often signified
by the kingdom of heaven, in the New Testament; the members of them
being heaven-born souls, and the doctrines and ordinances ministered
among them being from heaven; and there being a very great resemblance
between them and heaven, in the company and communion enjoyed in them;
and who declare the glory of the divine perfections, which is very great
in the handiwork of their redemption; and who ascribe the glory of their
whole salvation to God: or rather the apostles and first preachers of
the word, as appears from [Rom 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#018.md);
who were set in the highest place in the church; had their commission,
doctrine, and success from heaven; and who may be called by this name,
because of the purity and solidity of their ministry, and their
constancy and steadfastness in it, and because of their heavenly lives
and conversations: these declared the glory of the divine perfections;
such as those particularly of grace, goodness, and mercy, which are not
discoverable by the light of nature or law of Moses, as, they are
displayed in the salvation of men by Christ, in the forgiveness of their
sins, the justification of their persons, and the gift of eternal life
unto them: they taught men to ascribe the glory of salvation to God
alone, Father, Son, and Spirit; they set forth in their ministry the
glory of Christ, of his person, and of his offices and grace; and they
showed that redemption was his handiwork, as follows:

and the firmament showeth his handiwork; for the same persons may be
called the firmament, since they that are wise are said to shine as the
brightness of it, [Dan 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#003.md). These
were like to stars in it, and were the light of the world, and declared
that redemption is the work which Christ undertook, and came into this
world to perform, and which he has finished; his hands have wrought it,
and his own arm has brought salvation to him. The Targum interprets the
heavens and the firmament, of such persons as contemplate the heavens,
and look upon the firmament or air; and so do some other Jewish writers
(w).

[Psalms 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 19:2</span></span>

Day untoday uttereth speech,.... This, with the following clause,

and night untonight showeth knowledge, some understand of the constant
and continued succession of day and night; which declares the glory of
God, and shows him to be possessed of infinite knowledge and wisdom; and
which brings a new accession of knowledge to men; others, of the
continual declaration of the glory of God, and of the knowledge of him
made by the heavens and the firmament, the ordinances of which always
continue; the sun for a light by day, and the moon and stars for a light
by night; and so night and day constantly and successively proclaim the
glory and wisdom of God: but rather this is to be understood of the
constancy of the Gospel ministry, and the continuance of the evangelic
revelation. The apostles of Christ persevered in their work, and
laboured in the word and doctrine night and day: they were in it at all
seasons; yea, were instant in season and out of season; and though they
are dead, the Gospel continues, and will do as long as day and night
remain: and these, like overflowing fountains, sent forth in great
abundance, as the word (x) rendered "uttereth" signifies, the streams of
divine light and knowledge; they were full of matter, and their tongues
were as the pen of a ready writer; they diffused the savour of the
knowledge of Christ, in great plenty, in every place where they came.
These words express the continuance of the Gospel revelation, as the
next do the extent of it.

[Psalms 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 19:3</span></span>

There is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard,.... Not
the voice of the day and night; as if the sense was, that there is no
people, of any speech or language under the sun, but there is something
said every day and night of the weather, what it is, or will be, as the
face of the heavens appears morning and evening: but of the heavens and
firmament; the meaning of which some take to be this; either that though
they have no proper speech nor language, yet there is a voice in them
which is heard, declaring the glory of God and his handiworks; and the
words may very well be rendered, "they have no speech nor words, without
these their voice is heard"; or that there is no people, nation, or
language under the heavens; see [Dan
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#004.md); though they are ever so different
one from another, so as not to be able to understand each other; yet the
voice of the heavens, uttering and proclaiming the glory of their Maker,
is heard and understood by them all: but rather this is to be
interpreted of the extent of the Gospel ministry by the apostles; who,
according to their commission, went everywhere preaching the word, to
men of all nations, of every speech and language; for which they were
qualified, by having the gift of various tongues bestowed upon them; so
that there were no nations, of ever so barbarous a speech and language,
but they were capable of speaking to and of being understood by them;
and though they could not understand one another, they all heard the
apostles speak in their own tongues the wonderful works of God, [Act
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#004.md). Their voice, in the ministration
of the Gospel, was heard in every nation externally, and by many
internally: faith came by hearing; and they received the word with
gladness and readiness. This gives the Gospel revelation a superiority
to the legal one; that was only made to one nation, to the nation of the
Jews; the voice of that was not heard elsewhere; but the voice of the
Gospel is heard in all nations; this revelation is published throughout
the world: and this shows that these words belong to the times of the
apostles, after they had received a commission from Christ, to go into,
all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature; which was done
before the destruction of Jerusalem, [Mat
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#014.md); and which is further confirmed
by what follows.

[Psalms 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 19:4</span></span>

Their line is gone out through all the earth,.... Not the line or
writings in the book of the creatures, the heavens, and the earth, which
lie open, and are legible, and to be seen and read of all men; nor the
line and writings in the book of the Scriptures, called line upon line,
and precept upon precept, [Isa 28:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#013.md),
which, though first given to the Jews, were written for the instruction
of others, and have been communicated to them; but the line of the
apostles: everyone had his line or measure; or the course he was to
steer was measured out and directed to him; the line of one, where he
was to go and preach the Gospel, reached so far one way, and the line of
another reached so far another way; and what with one and another, their
line reached throughout all the earth; see [Co2
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#013.md); the apostle citing these words
in [Rom 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#018.md); renders them, "their
sound went", &c. the sound of the Gospel, as published by them; which
agrees with the next clause;

and their words to the end of the world; to the isles afar off, even to
these northern and distant ones of England, Scotland, and Ireland, which
were reached and visited with the Gospel, either by the apostles, or at
least by some of the first ministers of the word;

in them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun; that is, in the heavens
and firmament, where the natural sun is placed; and its habitation is
fitly called a tabernacle, because it is always in motion and never
stops: or this may have some respect to its setting, when, according to
the common appearance, and to common understandings, it seems to be hid
as in a tent or tabernacle; to be as it were gone to bed, and at rest;
when in the morning it rises gay and cheerful, and comes forth like a
bridegroom out of his chamber, as is said in [Psa
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#005.md), but this is all to be
understood, spiritually and mystically, of Christ the sun of
righteousness, who has his tabernacle among his people, his churches;
and particularly has a place, and the chief place, in the ministry of
the Gospel, being the sum and substance of it; and this is of God's
putting there, who committed to his apostles the word of reconciliation,
the sum of which is Christ; and this is what makes the Gospel so
glorious a light, so clear a revelation as it is: the nature,
continuance, and extent of this revelation, are described in the
foregoing verses; the perspicuity and clearness of it is set forth in
this clause, and in what follows.

[Psalms 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 19:5</span></span>

Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,.... His nuptial
chamber, on which Elias writes (y),

"we call the garment (or canopy) spread over the head of the bridegroom
and bride, supported by four pillars, in the time of their espousals, ''

who looks lovely and beautiful in his nuptial robes, cheerful and
pleasant in his countenance, creating pleasure and delight in all his
friends that see him and hear his voice: and this simile is expressive
of the brightness and glory of the sun when it rises; and of the joy and
pleasure which it produces in the minds of men when they behold it: all
which sets forth the loveliness and beauty of Christ, as he is held
forth in the ministration of the Gospel, and the joy unspeakable and
full of glory which his presence yields, after a short departure from
his people; see [Isa 61:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010.md);

and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race; in which he shows his
readiness, velocity, and strength; and this denotes the swiftness of the
sun in running its course, and its indefatigableness in its constant
motion; though it has been employed therein for so many thousands of
years, yet every morning rises with the same cheerfulness, pursues its
course, and is never weary: all which may point at the readiness of
Gospel ministers, their swiftness to run to and fro, and their strength
to fulfil the course of their ministry, in which Christ, the sun of
righteousness, is held forth in so glorious a manner.

\(y\) Elias, in his Tishbi, p. 119. The same word is used Isa. iv. 5.
and translated "a defence".

[Psalms 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 19:6</span></span>

His going forth is from the end of the heaven,.... From the east, where
it rises:

and his circuit to the ends of it; to the west, where it sets; which is
expressive of the large compass the Gospel administration took in the
times of the apostles; whereby the grace of God appeared to all men,
shone out in a very illustrious manner, and Christ became, what the sun
is to the earth, the light of the world;

and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof; though things may be hid
from the light of it, yet not from its heat, so forcible and penetrating
it is Christ, in the administration of the Gospel to all to whom it
comes with power, not only enlightens their minds, but quickens their
souls, warms their hearts, causes them to burn within them, arises with
healing in his wings upon them, and makes his Gospel the savour of life
unto life unto them. The psalmist goes on to say more and excellent
things of the Gospel, its nature and usefulness.

[Psalms 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 19:7</span></span>

The law of the Lord is perfect,.... By which is meant, not the law of
Moses, or the ten commandments, but the "doctrine" of the Lord; as the
word "torah", signifies, even the whole word of God, as in [Isa
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#020.md). All the Scriptures of truth,
which are profitable for doctrine; for setting doctrine in a clear
light, and for the vindication and establishment of it, and are the rule
of doctrine both to preachers and hearers; and which are "perfect",
contain the whole mind and will of God, both with respect to faith and
practice; whereby the man of God is made perfect, and thoroughly
furnished to all good works, [Ti2
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#016.md); and especially the Gospel part
of the word of God may be designed, which both in the Old and New
Testament is called "a law" or "doctrine", being eminently so; the
doctrine of the Messiah, and of justification by faith in his
righteousness, [Isa 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003.md), [Rom
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#027.md). The Gospel is a perfect plan and
scheme of spiritual and saving truths: it gives an account of perfect
things; as of the perfect righteousness of Christ, and complete
justification by it; of the full as well as free pardon of sins by the
blood of Christ; and of redemption and salvation from all sin and evils
by him: and it also shows where true perfection is; namely, in Christ,
in whom the saints are complete, be being made to them wisdom,
righteousness, sanctification, and redemption; see [Jam
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#025.md). This character, therefore, suits
better with the Gospel than with the moral law; though that, as it is to
be gathered out of the whole word of God, contains the good and perfect
will of God, with respect to what is to be done or avoided; nor is
anything to be added to it; nor did our Lord come to add unto it, or to
make it more perfect, but to fulfil it, which men could not do; nor
could the law make any man or anything perfect, either perfectly
sanctify, or justify, or save; whereas the bringing in of the better
hope in the Gospel does, [Heb 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#007.md). The
effect, under a divine influence and blessing ascribed to it, is,

converting the soul; which is a further proof that the law of Moses is
not intended: for though by it is the knowledge of sin, or conviction of
sin, which often falls short of conversion; yet the Spirit of God, as a
spirit of regeneration, conversion, and sanctification, is not received
through the doctrine or preaching of the law, but through the
ministration of the Gospel; which is designed to turn men from darkness
to light, and from the powers of Satan to God; and which use it has when
it is attended with the demonstration of the Spirit and of power; see
[Rom 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#020.md), though the words may be
rendered "relieving", that is, refreshing and comforting the "soul" (z)
as in [Lam 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#011.md); Through want of
bodily food, which is the case in the passage retorted to, the spirits
faint and sink, the soul is almost gone, when, by the ministration of
proper food, it is as it were brought back again, as the word (a) here
used signifies, and the animal spirits are cheered and revived: and of
like use is the Gospel; it is the food of the soul, by which it is
refreshed and exhilarated, when ready to sink and faint away; hereby it
is restored and revived, comforted and nourished;

the testimony of the Lord is sure; this is another name for the word of
God, or the Holy Scriptures; so called because they testify of Christ,
of his person, office, and grace; of what he is, was to do, and suffer,
and perform for his people, and of his glory that should follow thereon,
[Joh 5:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#039.md); and particularly the
doctrine of the Gospel is the testimony of our Lord Jesus Christ, both
which he himself testified, and which is a testimony concerning him,
[Ti2 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#008.md). And this is "sure", or "to
be believed" (b); the whole of Scripture is true, coming from the God of
truth; having for its principal subject Christ, who is truth itself, and
being dictated by the Spirit of truth; and particularly the Gospel part
of it, and all the truths therein contained, especially the doctrine of
salvation by Christ, which is a faithful saying, and worthy of all
acceptation: the Gospel is a testimony of record which God himself has
bore concerning his Son, and eternal life by him, and therefore sure and
to be depended upon; for if the witness of men is received, the witness
of God is greater, [Jo1 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#009.md). The
effect ascribed to the word of God, Or to the Gospel under this
character, is,

making wise the simple. The Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic,
and Ethiopic versions, render it "babes" or "children"; and so
Apollinarius; and the word here used in the Arabic language, is said to
(c) signify such; and here it intends babes and children not in years,
but in understanding, to whom God is pleased to reveal the truths of his
Gospel, when he hides them from the wise and prudent: these simple ones
are such who are sensible of their simplicity and folly, and of their
want of understanding; who, with Agur, think themselves more foolish
than any man, and have not the understanding of a man; and these, by the
word of God, are made wise to know themselves, their folly, sinfulness,
imperfections, and impotence; and are made wise unto salvation, to know
the right way of salvation by Christ; see [Ti2
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#015.md); where the same phrase is used as
here, and seems to be borrowed from hence, and is used of the
Scriptures; which also make men wise in the knowledge of Gospel
doctrines, the wisdom of God in a mystery, which to know is the greatest
wisdom and understanding, and much more so than to be acquainted with
the law only, [Deu 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#006.md).

[Psalms 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 19:8</span></span>

The statutes of the Lord are right,.... The word of God may be called
"statutes", or "visitations" (d) because that God will visit, in a way
of resentment, such persons as despise its authority, do not act
according to it, or add unto it, or detract from it; or the word may be
rendered "commissions" (e), things committed to trust, as the Scriptures
were to the Jews, [Rom 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#001.md); and as the
Gospel is committed to the trust of the ministers of it, who faithfully
dispense it, [Co2 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019.md). Now these may
be said to be right, as the word of the Lord is, [Psa
33:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#004.md); since they set men right in
their principles, and direct them to right practices; they are the means
of making them upright in heart, and in conversation: the doctrines of
the word of God have nothing crooked, froward, and perverse in them; are
without sophism, and the hidden things of dishonesty; they are all in
righteousness, and plain and easy in everything respecting salvation, to
those who have a spiritual knowledge and understanding of them, [Pro
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#008.md); they lead into right and straight
paths of truth and holiness, in which wayfaring men, though fools, shall
not err; and particularly the Gospel directs to the right way of
salvation and eternal life by Jesus Christ; the effect of which is

rejoicing the heart. This cannot be understood of the law, which is a
voice of terror, pronounces guilty, curses and condemns, is the killing
letter, and works wrath; but of the Gospel part of the word, which is a
joyful sound; publishes good tidings of good things; and, when applied
by the Spirit of God, is found to have this effect, see [Jer
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#016.md);

the commandment of the Lord is pure; not only the Scriptures in general
may bear this name, because they deliver out the commands of God to men,
as those of a moral and ceremonial kind to the Jews under the former
dispensation; so the ordinances of Christ, which are his commands under
the Gospel dispensation; yea, the Gospel itself may be so called,
though, strictly speaking, it has no command in it; because, according
to the commandment of the everlasting God, it is made known to all
nations for the obedience of faith, [Rom
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025.md); besides, the commandment is no
other than the word or doctrine, see [Jo1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#007.md); and as every commandment of the
Lord, of what kind soever it is, is pure and holy, so is every word of
God, [Pro 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#005.md); being without any
mixture of men's inventions, or the dross of corrupt doctrine, sincere,
unadulterated, clear of all chaff and impurity, consistent, uniform, and
all of a piece, and which tends to promote purity of heart, life, and
conversation;

enlightening the eyes: that is, of the understanding, so as for a man to
see his lost state and condition by nature; to see the glory, fulness,
and grace of Christ; to behold wondrous things in the doctrine of the
Gospel, and to observe the way of duty in which he should walk: this is
the eyesalve in [Rev 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#018.md); and so the
Jewish doctors (f) explaining this text call the law, using the same
word as there.

[Psalms 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 19:9</span></span>

The fear of the Lord is clean,.... Still the word of God is intended,
which teaches men to fear the Lord; gives a full account of the worship
of God, which is often meant by the fear of God; it instructs in the
matter and manner of worship; and nothing more powerfully engages to
serve the Lord with reverence and godly fear than the Gospel does: and
this is "clean"; and the doctrines of it direct to the blood of Christ,
which cleanses from all sin, and to the righteousness of Christ, the
fine linen, clean and white; the promises of it put the saints on
cleansing themselves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit; and the
whole of it is the word of truth, by which God and Christ sanctify the
church and the members of it, [Joh
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#002.md). And this word is

enduring for ever; the law is done away; the ceremonial law entirely,
and the moral law, as a covenant of works, and as to the ministration of
it by Moses; but the Gospel continues; it is an everlasting one; it
endures for ever, notwithstanding all the opposition made to it by open
persecution, or false teachers;

the judgments of the Lord are true, and righteous altogether; "the
judgments of the Lord" are the same with "the word of God", as appears
from [Psa 119:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#025.md); and these seem to
design that part of the word, which contains rules of God's judging and
governing his people; or the laws, orders, and ordinances of Christ in
his house, which his people should observe, and yield a cheerful
obedience to, he being their King, Judge, and Lawgiver: and these are
"true", or "truth" (g) itself; being wisely made, according to the truth
of things, and agreeable to the holiness and righteousness of God, and
so righteous; not at all grievous, but easy, pleasant, and delightful,
one and all of them.

[Psalms 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 19:10</span></span>

More to be desired are they than gold,.... This refers to all the truths
in the word of God; to all the doctrines of the Gospel; which, by good
men, are more desirable, and by them more prized and valued, than all
worldly riches and treasure;

yea, than much fine gold: more than gold, and the best of gold, and a
great deal of it, than thousands of gold and silver; see [Psa
119:72](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#072.md), [Pro
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#010.md);

sweeter also than honey, and the honeycomb; or "the dropping of the
honeycombs" (h), which is the purest and sweetest of the honey; and what
honey is to the natural taste of men, that is the Gospel, and the truths
of it, to the spiritual taste of believers, [Psa
119:103](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#103.md); and when the presence of
Christ is enjoyed, his love is shed abroad, and the blessings of his
grace are partook of, the ordinances of the Gospel are very delightful,
[Sol 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#003.md); eloquence, and eloquent
orators, are sometimes described by mellifluous words; or by their
expressions being like honey, and sweeter than that (i).

[Psalms 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 19:11</span></span>

Moreover, by them is thy servant warned,.... By whom the psalmist means
himself, who was the servant of the Lord, not only in common with other
saints, but as he was a king and prophet, and as such he received
advantage from the word of God; all his instructions as a prophet, and
all his rules of government as a king; and the whole of that wisdom,
prudence, and knowledge, with which the conducted in both offices, were
from the Lord by his word: and it may be applied to any servant of the
Lord, and especially in an ecclesiastical office, as an apostle of
Christ, and minister of the word; who serve God in the Gospel of his
Son, and, by means of the Scriptures, are furnished for every good work;
and also to believers in Christ in common; who, of whatsoever rank and
quality, in whatsoever state and condition of life, whether high or low,
rich or poor, bond or free, are Christ's servants; and whatsoever is
written is for their instruction, and by the word of God they are
"warned"; the Scriptures are a way mark to them, to direct them in a
right way, and to caution them against turning to the right or left;
either to immoral practices, or the errors and heresies of wicked men:
it is a lamp to their feet, and a light to their path, and teaches them
to walk circumspectly, and warns them of rocks, gins, and snares in the
way; or, as the words may be rendered, "by them is thy servant made
clear", or "bright" (k); so the word is used in [Dan
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#003.md); that is, in his understanding:
the psalmist confirms, by his own experience, what he had said before of
the word, [Psa 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#008.md); that it
enlightened the eyes: the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ shining
into the heart gives the light of the glory of God in the person of
Christ; it illuminates and irradiates the mind, and gives clear ideas of
the glory and perfections of God, of his counsels and covenant, of his
works of nature and of grace; and makes a bright discovery of the
person, offices, and grace of Christ; and of the blessed Spirit, and his
operations; and of the blessings of grace, and of eternal glory and
happiness;

and in keeping of them there is great reward; which is to be understood,
not of keeping the law of Moses, and the precepts of that, which, if a
man did keep perfectly and constantly, he should live in them; but of
observing the word of God, and by diligent searching into it, reading
and learning it, and meditating on it, to get and obtain knowledge of
divine things; which carries its own reward with it, and is better than
thousands of gold and silver; and of laying up the word of God, and the
truths of the Gospel, and keeping them in mind and memory, which is very
profitable and serviceable, to promote spiritual peace and comfort, and
to preserve from sin, doctrinal and practical; and also of yielding a
cheerful obedience to the Gospel, by cordially embracing and professing
the doctrines, and submitting to the ordinances of it; from all which
arise great profit, and much reward: such come at the knowledge of Jesus
Christ, which is preferable to everything else, and is more precious
than rubies; and all desirable things; such enjoy the presence of
Christ, have much peace and comfort in their souls; they are made wise
unto salvation, and are fitted for every good word and work.

[Psalms 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 19:12</span></span>

Who can understand his errors?.... Sin is an error, a wandering out of
the way of God, swerving from the rule of his word; and many mistakes
are made by the people of God themselves; even so many that they cannot
number them; they are more than the hairs of their head; they cannot
understand, find out and express, neither their number, nor their evil
nature, nor the many aggravating circumstances which attend them: this
the psalmist said, upon a view of the large extent, glory, and
excellency of the word of God; and upon comparing himself with it, in
which, as in a glass, he saw how far short he came of it, and what a
disagreement and want of conformity there was in him unto it; see [Psa
119:97](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#097.md); and he suggests, that though
the word he had been describing was perfect, pure, and clean, he was
not; nor could he expect any reward of debt, but merely of grace, for
his observance of it; and that it was best, under a sense of sin, to
have recourse, not to works of righteousness done by men; but to the
grace and mercy of God in Christ, as follows:

cleanse thou me from secret faults; by which are meant not such sins as
are done in secret, and are unknown to men; such as David's sin with
Bathsheba, [Sa2 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#012.md); nor the inward
motions of sin in the heart, to which none are privy but God, and a
man's own soul; not but that each of these may be properly enough
included in such a petition; but sins, which are unknown to a man
himself are meant: there are some actions, which, though known when
committed, are not known to be sinful ones; and there are some sins
which are committed unadvisedly, and through carelessness, and pass
unobserved; not only many vain and sinful thoughts pass to and fro
uncontrolled, without being taken notice of; but many foolish and idle
words are spoken, and many evil actions, through infirmity and
inadvertency, are done, which, when a good man, at the close of a day,
comes to reflect upon the things that have passed in it, are quite
hidden from him, are unknown to him, being unobserved by him; wherefore
such a petition is highly proper to be inserted in his address at the
throne of grace: and which also supposes the person sensible of the
defiling nature of sin, and of his own impotency to cleanse himself from
it; and that God only can do it, who does it by the application of the
blood of his Son, which cleanses from all sin; for this respects not
regenerating and sanctifying grace, but pardoning grace; a manifestation
of it, a view of acquittance from sin by Christ, and of freedom from
obligation to punishment for it.

[Psalms 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 19:13</span></span>

Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins,.... Some understand
these words of persons: the Septuagint, and the versions that follow
that, render it "from strangers": such who are strangers to God and
godliness; that is, keep from all conversation with them in things
sinful, or from others' sins; from having a fellowship with them, being
a partaker of them, lest their plagues and punishments should be shared
in: others, as the Targum, "from proud men", who are haughty, insolent,
and conceited of themselves; lest he should be so corrupted and drawn
aside by them: but rather the words are to be understood of sins
wilfully, contumaciously, and presumptuously committed; and the petition
supposes, that these may be committed by good men, if left to
themselves; and that there is a proneness in them to them; and that they
would rush into them, were they not kept back and restrained by the
powerful and efficacious grace of God: and it also supposes that the
saints cannot keep themselves; that God only can keep them from evil;
and therefore they pray to him that he would, who does keep them by his
power, at least from a final and total falling away

let them not have dominion over me: neither presumptuous sins, nor any
other, [Psa 119:133](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#133.md); as they shall
not, [Rom 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#014.md); as sin has over wicked
men; and they yield a ready obedience to the laws and lusts of it; it
reigns over them as a king and tyrant, even unto death: it is something
very powerful in good men; it prevails over them, and carries them
captive; wherefore they pray it may not have a continued dominion, as it
shall not; because they are in another kingdom, and under grace as a
governing principle, which reigns through righteousness unto eternal
life;

then shall I be upright; in heart, and walk uprightly in conversation;
being cleansed from secret faults, and kept from notorious crimes, and
gross enormities; and shall exercise a conscience void of offence, both
to God and man; and be "perfect", as the word is sometimes rendered, at
least comparatively; and absolutely so, as washed in Christ's blood, and
justified by his righteousness;

and I shall be innocent from the great transgression; which some
understand of pride, others of apostasy; perhaps the sin against the
Holy Ghost may be intended; though the words may be rendered, "from much
transgression" (k); and the sense is, that he should be cleared and
acquitted of a multitude of transgressions he had been guilty of; or be
preserved from much sin, which otherwise he should have fallen into.

[Psalms 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 19:14</span></span>

Let the words of my mouth,.... Meaning either his speech in common
conversation, which should not be filthy and foolish, rotten and
corrupt; but such as ministers grace to the hearer: or else his address
to God, both in prayer and thanksgiving;

and the meditation of my heart; his inward thoughts continually
revolving in his mind; or his meditation on the word of God and divine
things; or mental prayer, which is not expressed, only conceived in the
mind;

be acceptable in thy sight; as words and thoughts are, when they are
according to the word of God; and as the sacrifices of prayer, whether
vocal or mental, and of praise, are through Jesus Christ our Lord. The
psalmist, in order to strengthen his faith in God, that he should be
heard and answered in the petitions he put up, makes use of the
following epithets:

O Lord, my strength, or "rock" (l),

and my Redeemer; who had been the strength of his life and of his
salvation, the rock on which he was built and established, and the
Redeemer who had redeemed his life from destruction, and out of the
hands of all his enemies, and from all his iniquities.
