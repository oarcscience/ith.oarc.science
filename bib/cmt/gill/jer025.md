INTRODUCTION TO JEREMIAH 25

This chapter contains a prophecy of the destruction of Judea by the king
of Babylon; and also of Babylon itself, after the Jews' captivity of
seventy years; and likewise of all the nations round about. The date of
this prophecy is in [Jer 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#001.md); when
the prophet puts the Jews in mind of the prophecies that had been
delivered unto them by himself and others, for some years past, without
effect, [Jer 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#002.md); wherefore they are
threatened with the king of Babylon, that he should come against them,
and strip them of all their desirable things; make their land desolate,
and them captives for seventy years, [Jer
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#008.md); at the expiration of which he in
his turn shall be punished, and the land of Chaldea laid waste, and
become subject to other nations and kings, [Jer
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#012.md); and by a cup of wine given to
all the nations round about, is signified the utter ruin of them, and
who are particularly mentioned by name, [Jer
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015.md); which is confirmed by beginning
with the city of Jerusalem, and the destruction of that, [Jer
25:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#027.md); wherefore the prophet is bid to
prophesy against them, and to declare the Lord's controversy with them,
and that there should be a slaughter of them from one end of the earth
to the other, [Jer 25:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#030.md); upon which
the shepherds, kings, and rulers of them, are called to lamentation and
howling, [Jer 25:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#034.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 25:1</span></span>

The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah,....
Not only in the city of Jerusalem, but in the whole land of Judea. This
prophecy concerns them all; their repentance and reformation, to which
they are exhorted; or their invasion, desolation, and captivity, with
which they are threatened. Before the prophet was sent to the king of
Judah only, [Jer 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#001.md); now to all the
people:

in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; in the
latter part of the third, and beginning of the fourth year of his reign;
see [Dan 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001.md);

this was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon: in which he
began to reign with his father, for he reigned two years with him; who
is the Nabopolassar of Ptolemy. This was in the year of the world 3397,
and before Christ 607, according to Bishop Usher (f).

[Jeremiah 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 25:2</span></span>

The which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah,....
Perhaps at one of the three feasts, at which all the males appeared in
Jerusalem; for it cannot be thought that he went up and down throughout
all parts of the land to deliver this prophecy, but to as many of them
as he found in Jerusalem in any place, at any time; and none so likely
as what is mentioned:

and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem: to whom he had an opportunity
of speaking frequently:

saying; as follows:

[Jeremiah 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 25:3</span></span>

From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even
unto this day,.... The year in which Jeremiah began to prophesy, [Jer
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#002.md);

(that is, the three and twentieth year); for Josiah reigned one and
thirty years; so that Jeremiah prophesied nineteen years in his reign;
and now it was the fourth of Jehoiakim's, which make twenty three years;
so long the prophet had been prophesying to this people:

the word of the Lord hath come unto me; from time to time, during that
space of twenty three years; and which he diligently, constantly, and
faithfully delivered unto them; as follows:

and I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking: as soon as ever
he had a word from the Lord, he brought it to them, and took the most
proper and seasonable time to inculcate it to them; in the morning, and
after, he had had a vision or dream in the night from the Lord;

but ye have not hearkened; they took no notice of it; turned a deaf ear
to it; however, did not obey or act as they were directed and exhorted
to.

[Jeremiah 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 25:4</span></span>

And the Lord hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets,.... Not
only him, but many others, Micah, Nahum, Zephaniah, and others:

rising early and sending them; not only the prophet, but the Lord
himself is said to rise early, and send his prophets to them; which
denotes his great care and concern for this people for their good; see
[Jer 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#025.md);

but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear; which is an
aggravation of their sin; that whereas they had one prophet after
another sent to them, and sent by the Lord himself; he rising early, and
sending them; and they rising early, being sent to do their message; and
yet were not hearkened and attended to.

[Jeremiah 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 25:5</span></span>

They said,.... The prophets: this was the substance of their discourses
and prophecies, what follows:

turn ye again now everyone from his evil way, and from the evil of your
doings; repent of sins, and reform from them; particularly their
idolatries, to which they were prone, and are after mentioned:

and dwell in the land that the Lord hath given unto you to your fathers
for ever and ever; that is, the land of Canaan, which was given to them,
and their fathers before them, by the Lord, for an everlasting
inheritance, provided they behaved towards him aright; for they held the
possession of it by their obedience to his law; and now, notwithstanding
all that they had done, or had been threatened with; yet, if they
repented and reformed, they should still dwell in the land, and enjoy
it, and all the blessings and privileges of it.

[Jeremiah 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 25:6</span></span>

And go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them,.... So
long as they served the Lord God, they continued in their own land, in
the comfortable enjoyment of all the blessings of it; for their
government was a theocracy; God was their King; and as long as they
served and worshipped him only, he protected and defended them; but when
they forsook him, and went after other gods, and served and worshipped
them, then they were threatened to be turned out of their land, and
carried captive into other lands; and yet, after all, if they returned
from their idolatries, and left off worshipping idols, the Lord was
ready to receive them kindly, and continue his favours to them:

and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands; their idols,
which their own hands made, and then fell down to worship them; than
which nothing can be more provoking to God:

and I will do you no hurt; by sword, or famine, or pestilence, or
captivity; signifying the hurt he had threatened them with should not be
done, provided they forsook their idolatrous worship; God does no hurt
to his true worshippers; yea, he makes all things work together for
their good.

[Jeremiah 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 25:7</span></span>

Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith the Lord,.... Though it was he
that spake unto them by his prophets; and though it was so much to their
own good and advantage; and the neglect of him and his word were so much
to their disadvantage, and even ruin:

that ye might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands, to your
own hurt: which, though not signed to do either, yet eventually did
both; both provoked the Lord, and brought destruction upon themselves;
for whatever is against the glory of God is to the hurt of man; and
whatever provokes him is pernicious to them in its consequences.

[Jeremiah 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 25:8</span></span>

Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts,.... Of armies above and below;
and so can do what he pleases in heaven and in earth:

because ye have not heard my words; by the prophets, so as to obey them;
they had heard them externally, but did not observe to do them.

[Jeremiah 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 25:9</span></span>

Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north,

saith the Lord,.... The Targum is, the kingdoms of the north, the same
with those in [Jer 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#015.md); even all
those kingdoms which were subject to the king of Babylon, and lay north
of Judea:

and Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon my servant: though a great king,
he was a servant of the Lord of hosts; his servant, both as a creature
of his make, and as a king that ruled under him; and as he was an
instrument in his hand to chastise his people the Jews; though it was
not knowingly and with intention that he served the Lord:

and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants
thereof; the land of Judea, and its inhabitants; this was the Lord's
doing; it was he that stirred, up the king of Babylon, and by his secret
instinct and powerful providence brought him and his armies into Judea
to spoil it, and the inhabitants of it Jehovah as it were marched at the
head of them, and led them on, and brought them against the Jews, and
delivered them into their hands:

and against all these nations round about; Egypt and others; so that the
Jews could have no help from them; nor would application to them, and
alliance with them, signify anything:

and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and an
hissing, and perpetual desolations; both the Jews and their neighbours;
who should be an astonishment to some, and a hissing to others, and
remain desolate for a long time; even till the seventy years were ended
after mentioned.

[Jeremiah 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 25:10</span></span>

Moreover, I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of
gladness,.... At their festivals, and nuptial solemnities:

the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride; expressing
their mutual love unto, and delight in, each other; so agreeable to one
another and their friends: or it may mean those epithalamies, or nuptial
songs, sung unto them by their friends:

the sound of the millstones; either the voice of those that sing at the
mill while grinding; or rather the sound of the stones themselves used
in grinding; either in grinding spices for the bride cakes; or rather in
grinding corn for common use; and so denotes the taking away of bread
corn from them, and the want of that. The sense is, there should be corn
to grind, and so no use of the mill:

and the light of the candle; at their feasts and weddings, or rather,
for common use; signifying that houses should be desolate, without
inhabitants, no light in them, nor work to be done. The whole shows that
they should be deprived of everything both for necessity and pleasure.
John seems to have borrowed some phrases from hence, [Rev
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#022.md); in which he appears to have
followed the Hebrew text, and not the Greek version. The Targum of the
last clause is,

"the voice of the company of those that sing at the light of candles.''

[Jeremiah 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 25:11</span></span>

And this whole land shall be a desolation,.... Not only the city of
Jerusalem, but all Judea, without inhabitants, or very few, and shall be
uncultivated, and become barren and unfruitful:

and an astonishment; to all other nations, and to all persons that pass
through, beholding the desolations of it:

and other nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years; both
the Jews, and other nations of Egypt, reckoning from the date of this
prophecy, the fourth year of Jehoiakim's reign, when Daniel and others
were carried captive, [Dan 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001.md); to the
first year of Cyrus.

[Jeremiah 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 25:12</span></span>

And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished,....
Which were accomplished in the first year of Cyrus: they began with the
first year of Nebuchadnezzar, who reigned two years and two months with
his father Nabopolassar; after that forty three years by himself;
Evilmerodach two years: Neriglissar four years; Belshazzar or Nabonadius
seventeen years; and Darius the Median two years; which all make sixty
nine years and two months; and if ten months more be added to complete
the said seventy years, it will carry the end of them to the first year
of Cyrus (g). These years are differently reckoned by others; by
Spanhemius, from the first of Nebuchadnezzar, or fourth of Jehoiakim, to
the destruction of the city under Zedekiah, nineteen years; thence to
the death of Nebuchadnezzar, twenty four; then Evilmerodach, two; then
the reign of Neriglissar, including some months of Laborosoarchod, five;
then the years of Nabonadius, or Belshazzar, seventeen; and from his
death, or the taking of Babylon, to the death of Darius the Mede, two
years; which make sixty nine, exclusive of the first of Cyrus; and comes
to much the same as the former. By James Alting thus; from the
eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, complete, to his death, twenty six
years; Evilmerodach, twenty three; Belshazzar, three; Darius the Mede,
eighteen, after the destruction of the Babylonish empire; which seems
very wrong; better, by Dr. Lightfoot, thus; Nebuchadnezzar, forty five
current; Evilmerodach, twenty three; and Belshazzar, three (h). So the
Jewish chronicle (i):

that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith the Lord,
for their iniquity; the king for his tyranny, and the nation for their
idolatry; and both for these and other sins they were guilty of; for,
though they did the will of God in carrying the Jews captive, they no
doubt in their usage of them exceeded their commission, and were justly
punishable for their iniquities. This is not to be understood of the
present king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar; but of Nabonadius, or
Belshazzar, whom the Lord punished by Cyrus; who appears to have been a
very wicked man, and in the excess of not, profaning the vessels of the
temple the night he was slain, [Dan
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#001.md);

and the land of the Chaldeans; and will make it perpetual desolations;
even as other nations had been made by them, [Jer
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009.md).

[Jeremiah 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 25:13</span></span>

And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced
against it,.... By his prophets, and particularly by Jeremiah, as
follows; for not one word that is spoken by the Lord, either in a way of
promise or threatening, shall fail; his truth, power, and faithfulness,
are engaged to accomplish all:

even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied
against all the nations; the Egyptians, Philistines, Moabites, Edomites,
Arabians, Persians, and also the Babylonians, in [Jer
46:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#001.md), which prophecies, in the Greek
version, immediately follow here, though in a confused manner; where
some have thought they might be more regularly placed than as they are
in the Hebrew copies, at the end of the book; but of this there seems to
be no absolute necessity.

[Jeremiah 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 25:14</span></span>

For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them
also,.... Take their cities, seize upon the kingdoms, spoil them of
their wealth and riches, and bring them into servitude to them: these
"many nations", which should and did do all this, were the Medes and
Persians, and those that were subject to them, or were their allies and
auxiliaries in this expedition; and the "great kings" were Cyrus and
Darius, and those that were confederate with them:

and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to
the works of their own hands; as they have done to others, it shall be
done to them; as they have served themselves of other nations, other
nations shall serve themselves of them; as they have cruelly used
others, they shall be used with cruelty themselves; and as they have
made other countries desolate, their land shall become desolate also;
not only their tyranny and cruelty, but all their other sins, shall
receive a just recompence of reward.

[Jeremiah 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 25:15</span></span>

For thus saith the Lord God of Israel unto me,.... The prophet:

take the wine cup of this fury at my hand; in a vision the Lord appeared
to Jeremiah with a cup of wine in his hand, which he bid him take of
him. It is usual in Scripture for the judgments of God on men to be
signified by a cup of hot and intoxicating liquor, [Isa
51:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#017.md); particularly in [Psa
75:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#008.md); to which reference may be had;
as John seems to refer to the passage here in [Rev
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#010.md); called a cup, because they are
in measure, and but small in comparison of what will be inflicted in the
world to come; and a cup of "fury", because they proceed from the wrath
of God, stirred up by the sins of men. Jarchi interprets this cup of the
prophecy of vengeance, which the Lord delivered to Jeremiah; and not
amiss:

and cause all the nations to whom I send thee to drink it; prophesy unto
them what wrath and ruin shall come upon them.

[Jeremiah 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 25:16</span></span>

And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad,.... The judgments
foretold shall come upon them, whether they will or not; which will have
such effects upon them, as intoxicating liquor has on drunken persons;
make them shake and tremble, and reel to and fro, and toss and tumble
about, and behave like madmen:

because of the sword that I will send among them; this explains what is
meant by the wine cup of fury, the sword of a foreign enemy that shall
enter among them and destroy; and which would make them tremble, and be
at their wits' end, like drunken and mad men.

[Jeremiah 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 25:17</span></span>

Then took I the cup at the Lord's hand,.... In a visionary way, and did
as he commanded, and prophesied as he directed him. The prophet was
obedient to the heavenly vision, as became him:

and made all the nations to drink, unto whom, the Lord had sent me; not
that he travelled through each of the nations with a cup in his hand, as
an emblem of what wrath would come upon them, and they should drink deep
of; but this was done in vision, and also in prophecy; the prophet
publishing the will of God, denouncing his judgments upon the nations,
and declaring to them what would befall them.

[Jeremiah 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 25:18</span></span>

To wit, Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah,.... Which are mentioned
first, because God's judgments began with them, as they usually do with
the house of God, [Pe1 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#017.md); and even
now began; for this very year, in which this prophecy was delivered,
Nebuchadnezzar came up and besieged Jerusalem, and carried away some
captives, [Dan 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001.md); this was the
beginning of what afterwards were more fully executed:

and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof: the Kings Jehoiakim,
Jeconiah, and Zedekiah, with those of their families, the princes of the
blood, and their nobles:

to make them a desolation, an astonishment, an hissing, and a curse; to
strip them of their crowns and kingdom, of their wealth, and riches, and
honour, and bring them into slavery and bondage; so that they became an
astonishment to some, to see the change that was made in them; and were
hissed stand cursed by others:

(as it is this day); which is added, either because of the certainty of
it, or because it began to take, place this very year; though more fully
in Jeconiah's time, and still more in Zedekiah's; or rather this clause
might be added by Jeremiah after the captivity; or by Baruch, or by
Ezra, or whoever collected his prophecies, and put them into one volume,
as [Jer 52:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#001.md) seems to be added by
another hand.

[Jeremiah 25:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 25:19</span></span>

Pharaoh king of Egypt,.... Who is mentioned first after the kings of
Judah; not only because the Jews were in alliance with Egypt, and
trusted to them; and therefore this is observed, to show the vanity of
their confidence and dependence; but because the judgments of God first
took place on the king of Egypt; for in this very year, in which this
prophecy was delivered, Pharaohnecho king of Egypt was smitten by
Nebuchadnezzar, [Jer 46:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#002.md); though the
prophecy had a further accomplishment in Pharaohhophra, who was given
into the hands of his enemies, as foretold, [Jer
44:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#030.md);

and his servants, and his princes, and all his people; his menial
servants, his domestics, and his nobles and peers of the realm, and all
his subjects. It expresses an utter destruction of the kingdom of Egypt;
and the particulars of it may be the rather given, to show the vain
trust of the Jews in that people.

[Jeremiah 25:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 25:20</span></span>

And all the mingled people,.... Not the Arabians, who are mentioned
afterwards, [Jer 25:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#024.md); but rather a
mixed people in the land of Egypt, such as came out of it along with the
Israelites; or were near it, and bordered upon it, as the Targum; which
renders it, all the bordering kings; or rather a mixture of people of
different nations that dwelt by the sea coasts, either the
Mediterranean, or the Red sea, as others think:

and all the kings of the land of Uz; not the country of Job, called by
the Greeks Ausitis, as the Vulgate Latin version; but rather a country
of Idumea, so called from Uz the son of Dishan, the son of Seir, [Lam
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#021.md);

and all the kings of the land of the Philistines; the petty kings of it,
called the lords of the Philistines elsewhere, who were great enemies to
the people of the Jews: the prophecy of their destruction is in forty
seventh chapter, and whose principal cities are next mentioned:

and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod; of
Ashkelon, and the sword in it, and ruin, see [Jer
47:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#005.md). "Azzah" is the same with Gaza,
whose destruction is also foretold in [Jer
47:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#001.md); see [Act
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#026.md); "Ekron" was another of the
cities of the Philistines; see [Sa1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#010.md); and "Ashdod" is the same with
Azotus, another of their cities, [Act
8:40](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#040.md); called "the remnant of Ashdod",
because the remains only of a once very strong and fortified place; but
was so weakened and wasted by Psammiticus, king of Egypt, in a blockade
of it, for the space of nine and twenty years (k), before he took it,
that when he had got in it, it was but as the carcass of a city, to what
it was before (l).

[Jeremiah 25:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 25:21</span></span>

Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon. All well known and implacable
enemies of Israel. The Edomites descended from Esau; and the Moabites
and Ammonites from Moab and Ammon, the two sons of Lot by his daughters.
Their destruction is prophesied of in the forty eighth and forty ninth
chapters.

[Jeremiah 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 25:22</span></span>

And all the kings of Tyrus, and all the kings of Zidon,.... Two very
ancient cities in Phoenicia, frequently mentioned together in Scripture,
being near each other. Their ruin is foretold in [Jer
47:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#004.md);

and the kings of the isles which are beyond the sea; which some
understand of Greece and Italy; others of Rhodes, Cyprus, and Crete, and
other islands in the Mediterranean sea; the Cyclades, as Jerom: but the
words may be rendered, "and the kings of the country by the seaside";
and may design those that dwell upon the coast of the Mediterranean sea.

[Jeremiah 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 25:23</span></span>

Dedan, and Tema, and Buz,.... These seem to be places in Edom or Idumea,
of whose destruction Jeremiah prophesies in [Jer
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#007.md); or rather in Arabia and
Mesopotamia. Jerom reckons them among the Ishmaelites and Saracens, The
persons from whom they descended are mentioned in [Gen
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#021.md);

and all that are in the utmost corners; that is, either of the above
countries, or of the whole earth: or "all that had their hair shorn"
(m); or the corners of their beards; which Jerom says is applicable to
the Saracens.

And all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another,.... That
were on the north of Judea, the kings of Syria, and those that were near
to the kingdom of Babylon, whether more remote from Judea, or nearer it
and which joined one another in that part of the world;

and all the kingdoms of the world, which are upon the face of the earth;
the whole Babylonian monarchy, called the whole world; as the Roman
empire afterwards was, [Luk 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001.md);

and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them; or the king of Babylon,
as the Targum; and that Babylon is meant by "Sheshach" is certain from
[Jer 51:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#041.md); but why it is so called is
not so easy to say. The Jewish writers make it to be the same with
Babylon, by a change of the letters in the alphabet, put in such a
situation, which they call "Athbash", in which "shin" is put for "beth",
and "caph" for "lamed"; and so, instead of Babel or Babylon, you have
"Sheshach", which is thought to be used rather than Babylon, that
Nebuchadnezzar, now besieging Jerusalem, might not be irritated: but
others take it to be the name of an idol of the Babylonians, from whence
the city was called, which is not improbable; for, as Hillerus (o) has
observed, their god Bel and Sheshach signify the same thing. Bel is the
same as Behal, "swift"; and "Sheshach" may be derived from the Arabic
word which signifies "to move swiftly" (p); and may both be names of the
sun, worshipped by the Chaldeans, so called from the swiftness of its
motion. Now in Babylon stood the temple of Bel or Sheshach, and so might
have its name from thence: and it may be further observed, what has been
by others, that the Babylonians had a public festival, like the
Saturnalia of the Romans, which held five days, and was called Sacchoea
or Shace, as is supposed from their god Shach, to whom it was kept: to
which may be added, that Mishael had the name of Meshach given him in
Babylon; "Shach", in the one, answering to "El" in the other; which
signifies God, [Dan 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#007.md). Shach is used
for a king or prince in the Persic language to this day. And now the
king of Sheshach or Babylon must drink of the cup, or be punished last
of all; who was the instrument of destroying most of the rest, yet
should not go unpunished.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 25:27</span></span>

Therefore thou shalt say unto them,.... To the several nations before
mentioned, prophesied against:

thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; the Lord of armies,
above and below, the Sovereign of the whole universe; but in a special
and peculiar manner the God of Israel:

drink ye, and be drunken, and spew, and fall, and rise no more; as is
sometimes the case of drunken men; they drink till they are quite
intoxicated; and become drunk, and then they spew up what they have
drunk; and, attempting to walk, fall, and sometimes so as never to rise
more; not only break their bones, but their necks, or fall into places
where they are suffocated, or in one or other, where they lose their
lives. So it is signified, that these nations should drink of the cup of
God's wrath and fury; or his judgments should come upon them in such a
manner as that they should be obliged to part with all their riches,
power, and authority; and should fall and sink into such a ruinous
condition, as that they should never be able to the more to a prosperous
one:

because of the sword that I will send among you; by which they should be
destroyed. The Targum joins this with the preceding clause, thus,

"and ye shall not rise from before those that kill with the sword, whom
I send among you.''

[Jeremiah 25:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jer 25:28</span></span>

And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to
drink,.... To give credit to the prophecies of ruin and destruction
delivered by the prophet, but say, these things shall not be:

then shalt thou say unto them, thus saith the Lord of hosts, ye shall
certainly drink; or those judgments shall certainly be inflicted; there
will be no possibility of escaping, whether they were believed or not;
or how unwilling soever they were to believe the denunciations of them,
or to have them come upon them; yet assuredly so it would be; for thus
saith the Lord of hosts, who is omnipotent, and does what he pleases in
the armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth, over whom
he has a despotic power and government,

[Jeremiah 25:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 25:29</span></span>

For, lo, I begin to bring evil upon the city which is called by my
name,.... Jerusalem, the city of God, the holy city, where his name was
called upon, and he was worshipped; on this he would first bring down
his judgments; and indeed he had already begun to bring evil on it; for
this very year Nebuchadnezzar came up to besiege it, and carried some
away captives:

and should ye be utterly unpunished? or could they expect to go free
from punishment, who had so grossly sinned, and were guilty of such
abominable idolatries, and had been the means of drawing in the people
of God into the same; and therefore, since the professing people of God,
who had been drawn in by their examples, were punished, they could not,
they ought not, to think of escaping. See the like argument in [Luk
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#031.md);

ye shall not be unpunished; or cleared, or acquitted, or go free; but
made instances and examples of vindictive justice:

for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth,

saith the Lord of hosts; or I will call them that kill with the sword,
as the Targum; who will obey the call, answer to it, and come forth and
slay the inhabitants of the earth, and none shall escape.

Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto
them,.... What follows, as well as declare all that is before spoken
concerning the cup of fury all nations must drink of:

the Lord shall roar from on high: from, heaven, like a lion, in violent
claps of thunder; or in such dreadful dispensations of his providence,
as will be very amazing and terrifying:

and utter his voice from his holy habitation; from heaven, as before;
and though it will be terrible, yet quite consistent with his holiness
and justice:

he shall mightily roar upon his habitation; the temple at Jerusalem,
where he had his residence; but now should be deserted by him, and feel
the effects of his wrath in the destruction and desolation of it: or
rather, since the address is made to the nations of the world, and not
to the Jews, it may be rendered, "in" or "out of his habitation" (q);
and so designs heaven, as before; and all these expressions are intended
to show both the certainty and terribleness of the dispensation;

he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the
inhabitants of the earth; or, "answer a shout" (r); give the onset for
battle against the inhabitants of the earth, as the general of an army;
which is accompanied with a shout, like that which is made by workmen
treading in the wine press, to encourage one another to go on the more
cheerfully in their work.

A noise shall come up even to the ends of the earth,.... Wars, and
rumours of wars, everywhere, till the cup has gone round, and all
nations have drank of it, and have felt the power of divine wrath for
their sins:

for the Lord hath a controversy with the nations; will enter into a
judicial process with them; will litigate the point with them, and try
it openly; that it may be seen who is in the right, and who in the
wrong:

he will plead with all flesh; or enter into judgment with them, as
Kimchi; or reprove them in judgment, as Jarchi; he will be too many for
them; he will carry his case, overcome them in judgment, and reprove and
condemn them. Or the words may be rendered, "he will be judged by all
flesh" (s); he will submit it to the judgment of the whole world, if it
is not a righteous thing in him to do what he is about to do, and will
do; he will make it clear and manifest that he does nothing unjustly,
but all according to the strict rules of justice and equity:

he will give them that are wicked to the sword, saith the Lord; to be
destroyed by it, and none but them; and seeing they are such that
deserve it, he is not to be charged with unrighteousness in so doing.

Thus saith the Lord of hosts, behold, evil shall go forth from nation to
nation,.... Begin in one nation, and then go on to another; first in
Judea, and then in Egypt; and so on, like a catching distemper, or like
fire that first consumes one house, and then another; and thus shall the
cup go round from nation to nation, before prophesied of: thus,
beginning at Judea, one nation after another was destroyed by the king
of Babylon; then he and his monarchy were destroyed by the Medes and
Persians; and then they by the Macedonians; and then the Greeks by the
Romans;

and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth;
or "from the sides of it" (t); that is, "from the ends of it"; as the
Targum, which paraphrases it,

"and many people shall come openly from the ends of the earth;''

this was first verified in the Chaldean army under Nebuchadnezzar,
compared to a whirlwind, [Jer 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#013.md);
and then in the Medes and Persians under Cyrus; and after that in the
Greeks under Alexander; the great and last of all in the Romans under
Titus Vespasian.

And the slain of the Lord,.... Slain by his permission, yea, by his
orders, according to his will, in his wrath and sore displeasure, and to
glorify his vindictive justice:

shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end
of the earth; not that this should be at one and the same time; for
there never was such a time, that there was such a general slaughter in
the world, that the slain should reach from one end to the other; but
that within the dispensation, in which the cup should go round to all
nations, meant by "that day", the slain of the Lord would be in all
parts of the world; or that, according to his will, there would be a
great slaughter everywhere, as the cup went round, or the sword was
sent, first ravaging one country, and then another;

they shall not be lamented; having no pity from their enemies; and as
for their friends, they will share the same rite with them; so that
there will be none to mourn over them:

neither gathered; taken up from the field of battle where they fall;
but, where they should fall, there they should lie; none gathering up
their bodies or bones, in order for interment:

nor buried; in the sepulchres of their fathers, nor indeed in any place,
or in any manner; as not in any grand and magnificent manner, so not so
much as in a common way;

they shall be dung upon the ground; spread upon it, and lie above it, as
dung, to manure the earth.

[Jeremiah 25:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jer 25:34</span></span>

Howl, ye shepherds, and cry,.... The Targum is,

"howl, ye kings, and cry;''

and the rulers and governors of the nations before threatened with
destruction are meant; who are here called upon to lamentation and
mourning for the ruin and loss of their kingdoms; though Calvin thinks
that this is an apostrophe to the Jewish nation, and the rulers of it.
It is no uncommon thing in Scripture to call kings and civil magistrates
shepherds; see [Jer 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#001.md);

and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock; or "roll
yourselves in dust", as a token of mourning; as being in the utmost
distress, and incapable of helping themselves, and redressing the
grievances of their people; and therefore lie down and tumble about as
in the greatest anxiety and trouble, the Targum is,

"cover your heads with ashes, ye mighty of the people;''

meaning those who were in the highest posts of honour and profit; the
chief as to authority and power, riches and wealth;

for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished;
the time is come when they who were the fat of the flock, and were
nourished up for slaughter, should be slain. The allusion to shepherds
and sheep is still kept up; and such who should escape that, should be
scattered up and down the world, as a flock of sheep is by the wolf, or
any other beast of prey, when some are seized and devoured, and others
dispersed; and this was not the case of the Jews only, but of other
nations in their turn;

and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel; a vessel of worth and value,
and so desirable; as vessels of glass, of gems, or of earth, as of
Venice glass, of alabaster, of China; which when they fall and are
broken, become useless, and are irreparable; signifying hereby, that
their desirableness and excellency would not secure them from
destruction, and that their ruin would be irretrievable.

[Jeremiah 25:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">jer 25:35</span></span>

And the shepherds shall have no way to flee,.... Or, "and flight shall
perish from the shepherds" (u); though they may attempt it, they shall
not be able to accomplish it; neither the dignity of their persons, the
greatness of their power, or the abundance of their riches, would make a
way for them; their enemies being so numerous, powerful, and watchful:

nor the principal of the flock to escape; this was particularly verified
in Zedekiah and his princes, [Jer
39:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#004.md). The Targum is,

"and the house of fugitives shall perish from the kings, and deliverance
from the mighty of the people.''

And a voice of the cry of the shepherds,.... Or of the kings, as the
Targum:

and an howling of the principal of the flock, shall be heard; of the
mighty of the people, as the same; what is before called for is here
represented as in fact, because of the certainty of it:

for the Lord hath spoiled their pastures: their kingdoms, provinces,
cities, and towns; or their people, as the Targum, among whom they
lived, and by whom they were supported; still keeping up the metaphor of
the shepherd and flock. This the Lord is said to do because he suffered
it to be done, yea, ordered it to be done, as a punishment for their
sins.

[Jeremiah 25:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">jer 25:37</span></span>

And the peaceable habitations are cut down,.... Or, "their peaceable
ones", as the Targum; the palaces and stately dwellings, in which they
lived in great pomp and prosperity, in great peace, plenty, and safety,
are destroyed by the enemy, and laid waste, and become desolate; yea,
even those that lived peaceably and quietly, and neither were disturbed
themselves, nor disturbed others, yet, as is usual in times of war,
share the same fate with their neighbours, who have been more
troublesome and molesting:

because of the fierce anger of the Lord; or "from before it, from the
face of it"; shall be destroyed by it, that being displayed; and using
enemies as instruments in the destruction of them. Sin is the cause of
God's wrath and fierce anger, and his wrath and anger the cause of the
destruction of men and their habitations, Whoever are the instruments.

[Jeremiah 25:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">jer 25:38</span></span>

He hath forsaken his covert as a lion,.... Which some understand of God
leaving Jerusalem, or the temple, where he dwelt; who, while he made it
his residence, protected it; but when he forsook it, it became exposed
to the enemy. Kimchi says it may be understood of the destruction of the
first temple by Nebuchadnezzar; but he thinks it is most correct to
interpret it of the destruction of the second temple; that is, by the
Romans, when it was left desolate by Christ, the Lion of the tribe of
Judah. But it may be understood of Nebuchadnezzar leaving Babylon, his
den, and ranging about like a lion for his prey; see [Jer
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#007.md). So the Targum,

"and a king has removed from his tower or fortress;''

and the land is desolate; the land of Judea, or whatsoever country he
comes into with his army; that, or Egypt, or any other:

because of the fierceness of the oppressor; the tyrant Nebuchadnezzar;
or "oppressing sword" (w), as some supply it, it being feminine; and so
the Targum,

"from before the sword of the enemy.''

Some render it, "because of the fierceness of the dove"; so the Vulgate
Latin; and understand it of the Babylonians or Chaldeans; who, as the
Romans had an eagle, they had the dove on their standards or ensigns;
which they received from the Assyrians, when they succeeded them in
their monarchy; and those from Semiramis their first queen, who had it,
it is said, on her standard (x); and was retained in honour of her, and
in memory of her being nourished by a dove, and turned into one after
her death, as commonly believed (y); and who had her name, as is
affirmed (z), from the word "semira", signifying, in the Chaldee
language, the song or cooing of the dove; but fierceness ill agrees with
the dove, which is a meek and harmless creature;

and because of his fierce anger; either of God, or of the king of
Babylon his instrument, in destroying nations; not Judea only, but many
others.
