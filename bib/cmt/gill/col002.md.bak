INTRODUCTION TO COLOSSIANS 2

In this chapter the apostle expresses his great concern for the
Colossians, and others he had never seen; exhorts them to constancy in
the faith of Christ; warns them of false teachers, and their tenets;
takes notice of various blessings and privileges they had by Christ, and
cautions against several superstitions and corruptions, which were
obtaining among the churches of Christ: in [Col
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001.md) the apostle declares the conflict
he had for the persons he writes to, and for others, though they had
never seen him, which he was desirous they might be acquainted with;
partly for the comfort of their hearts, their cement in love, and the
improvement of their knowledge of divine things, the treasures of which
are in Christ, [Col 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002.md), and partly
that they might not be deceived by the enticing words of the false
teachers, [Col 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#004.md), and should his
absence and distance from them be objected to his professed concern and
affection for them, he answers, that notwithstanding that, he was
present with them in spirit, and had a discerning of their faith and
order, and the steadfastness thereof, with pleasure, [Col
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#005.md), wherefore he exhorts them to
perseverance in the faith of Christ, and to an abounding: in it, [Col
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#006.md), and to take heed of being hurt by
the vain philosophy and traditions of the Jews, but to keep close to
Christ, and the truths of his Gospel, seeing all fulness is in him, and
they were full in him, who is over all, and superior to all, and
therefore had no need to have recourse unto, and hearken to any other,
[Col 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009.md), nor did they need any Jewish
ordinances, particularly circumcision, since they were partakers of
another and better circumcision in Christ; and besides, were buried in
baptism with him; and even though they had been dead in sin, and in
their fleshly uncircumcision, yet they were alive, quickened with
Christ, and had the forgiveness of all their sins for his sake; who had
freed them from the ceremonial law, and had rid them of all their former
lords and masters, and had brought them into the liberty of the Gospel,
[Col 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#011.md), wherefore he concludes, by
way of exhortation and advice, first with respect to Jewish ceremonies,
not to suffer them to be imposed upon them, or to regard the censures of
men for the non-observance of them, since these were but shadows, of
which Christ is the substance, [Col
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#016.md), and next with respect to the
worship of angels, under a notion of humility, some were for
introducing; who are described as bold intruders, vain, proud, and
conceited persons, and as not holding the head Christ, to whom the body
the church is joined, and by whom it is nourished and increased, [Col
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018.md), and seeing now they that are
Christ's are dead with him to the ceremonial law, and that dead to them,
the apostle argues that they should not be subject to the ordinances,
commands, and doctrines of men; some of which he instances in, as if
they were still under the rudiments of the world; and the rather, since
these things had no true wisdom in them, only a show of it, and were no
other than will worship and superstition, and lay in a negligence of the
body, and were dishonourable and unsatisfying, [Col
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#020.md).

[Colossians 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">col 2:1</span></span>

For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you,.... This is
occasioned by what he had said in [Col
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#029.md), that he laboured and strove
according to the energy of divine power in him, to present every man
perfect in Christ; and lest these Colossians should think that these
labours and strivings of his were only for all and every of those
persons among whom he was, and to whom he personally preached, he would
have them know, observe, and assure themselves, that the great conflict,
strife, and agony, in which he was engaged, was for them also; by which
he means, his fervent prayers and wrestlings with God, the conflicts he
had in his own mind, with his own spirit, about the good of the churches
of Christ, the care of which were upon him, and even of those to whom he
was by face unknown, sometimes hoping, sometimes fearing, sometimes
rejoicing, at other times weeping, at what he heard concerning them;
also his combats with the false apostles, striving and earnestly
contending for the faith of the Gospel, giving no place to them, no, not
for an hour, defending truth, refuting error, and fighting the good
fight of faith, by preaching, writing, and disputing; likewise the
various persecutions, great afflictions, and hardships he met with from
men, for the sake of the Gospel; add to all this, the frequent battles
he had with the enemy of souls, his wrestlings against principalities
and powers, the many temptations of Satan with which he was attacked, to
draw him off from the service of Christ, to weaken his hands, and hinder
his success in it; all which he endured and went through with a
greatness of mind, and that for the good of the churches of Christ, and
the glory of his name, which were the great things he had in view and
among others, for the good of these Colossians,

and for them at Laodicea; the saints of that place, the church of Christ
which was there; and is the rather mentioned, because near to Colosse:
it was a famous city by the river Lycus, first called Diospolis, and
then Rhoas (p), and afterwards Laodicea; it was the metropolis of
Phrygia, in which Colosse stood: hence this epistle is ordered to be
read to them also, they being infested with false teachers, and in the
same situation and circumstances as the Colossians were; and though the
apostle was unknown to both of them, having never been at either place,
yet was heartily concerned for each of their welfare, and he strove for
them as he did for others; one of Stephens's copies adds, "and them in
Hierapolis"; see [Col 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#013.md).

And for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh; meaning the
churches in Christ, and believers in him; such as had never heard him
preach, nor had any personal knowledge of him, and conversation with
him, which tend to knit the hearts of Christians more firmly together;
yet his heart was towards them, he laboured for them, by praying for
them, writing to them, suffering all things for their sakes, for the
confirmation of them, and of the Gospel of Christ. Christian love and
care, and the benefit of the labours and sufferings of Gospel ministers,
extend and reach to persons that never saw them,

[Colossians 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">col 2:2</span></span>

That their hearts might be comforted,.... Here follow the reasons why
the apostle had so great a conflict, on account of the above persons,
and why he was so desirous they should know it; one is, the consolation
of their hearts. The hearts of God's people often need comfort, by
reason of indwelling sin, the temptations of Satan, the hidings of God's
face, and afflictive providences; and by reason of false teachers, who
greatly trouble them, unsettle their minds, weaken their faith, and fill
them with doubts and perplexities, and which was the case with these
churches: now the business of Gospel ministers is to comfort such; this
is the commission they are sent with; the doctrines of the Gospel are
calculated for this very purpose, such as full redemption, free
justification, complete pardon of sin, peace and reconciliation; and the
bent of their ministry is to comfort distressed minds, upon what account
soever; and it must be a comfort to these churches, when they found that
they were regarded by so great an apostle; and it might tend to confirm
them in the doctrine they had received at first, and deliver them from
the scruples the false apostles had injected into their minds, and so
administer comfort to them, when they perceived that the apostle
approved of the Gospel they had heard and embraced, and rejected the
notions of the false teachers:

being knit together in love: as the members of an human body are, by
joints and bands; as love is the bond of union between God and his
people, Christ and his members, so between saints and saints; it is the
cement that joins and keeps them together, and which edifies and builds
them up, and whereby they increase with the increase of God; it makes
them to be of one heart and one soul; it renders their communion with
one another comfortable and delightful, and strengthens them against the
common enemy, who is for dividing, and so destroying; and is what is the
joy of Gospel ministers, and what they labour at and strive for, and
which is another reason of the apostle's conflict:

and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding; that is,
spiritual knowledge and understanding, or the understanding of spiritual
things; for the understanding of things natural and civil is not
designed; nor a mere notional knowledge of spiritual things, which
persons may have, and yet not charity, or love, with which this is here
joined; and such an one also, which is sure and certain: for as there is
such a thing as the assurance of faith, and the assurance of hope, so
likewise of understanding of the Gospel, and the truths of it;
concerning which there ought to be no doubt, being to be received upon
the credit of a divine testimony: moreover, such a knowledge and
understanding of divine things is intended, as is large and abundant,
signified by "all riches"; for though it is not complete and perfect in
this life, yet it takes a vast compass, and reaches to all the deep
things of God; to whatever relates to the person and grace of Christ; to
all the things of the Spirit of God; to all the blessings and promises
of the covenant of grace; to the riches both of grace and glory, to the
things of time and eternity, and which is more clearly explained by the
following clause:

to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of
Christ; that is, to a greater and more perfect knowledge, approbation,
and confession of the Gospel, which he had in the preceding chapter
called the mystery; see [Col 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#026.md), and
here "the mystery of God", which he is both the author and subject of:
it is by him as the efficient cause, ordained by him, and hid in him
before the world was; and it is of him, as the subject matter of it; not
as the God of nature and providence, which the works of both declare;
but as the God of all grace, as God in Christ, which is the peculiar
discovery of the Gospel: and "of" him as "the Father" of Christ, which
is not discoverable by the light of nature, nor known by natural reason,
but is a point of divine revelation; and "of" him as the Father of his
people by adoption; and of all his grace, in election to grace and
glory; in predestination to sonship, and in the council and covenant of
grace; in the scheme of salvation and redemption; in the mission of his
Son, and the gift of him as a Saviour and Redeemer. The copulative "and"
before "the Father", is left out in the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and
Arabic versions, which read "the mystery of God the Father"; and with
it, it may be rendered, as it sometimes is, God, "even the Father":
though the word "God" may be considered essentially, and as after
distinguished into two of the persons of the Godhead; "the Father" the
first person, so called, in relation to his Son, which is no small part
of the mystery of the Gospel; and "Christ" the second person, who is
equally God with the Father; and the Spirit, who, though not mentioned,
is not excluded from this adorable mystery: and which is the mystery "of
Christ", he being both the efficient cause and the subject matter of it;
it treats of his deity and personality; of his offices, as Mediator,
prophet, priest, and King; of his incarnation and redemption; of his
grace, righteousness, sacrifice, and satisfaction; of justification by
him, pardon through him, and acceptance in him.

[Colossians 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">col 2:3</span></span>

In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. This may be
understood either of the mystery of the Gospel, which contains the rich
mines and hidden treasures of all divine truths; so called, because of
the richness and intrinsic value and excellency of them; and because of
their variety and abundance, being the unsearchable riches of Christ: or
of Christ himself; and not so much of his personal wisdom, either as
God, being the all-wise God, the wisdom of God, an omniscient Being,
that knows all persons and things whatever, within the whole circle of
wisdom and knowledge; or as man, whose wisdom and knowledge, though
created, was very large and abundant; or as Mediator, on whom the spirit
of wisdom and understanding, of counsel and of knowledge, rests; but of
that fulness of truth as well as grace, which dwells in him as in its
subject and fountain; by whom it comes, and from whom it is derived unto
us; and our highest wisdom and knowledge lies in knowing him, whom to
know is life eternal; and the excellency of whose knowledge surpasses
everything else; it is the greatest riches, and most valuable treasure;
nor is there anything worth knowing but what is in Christ, all is laid
up in him: and being said to be "hid" in him, shows the excellency of
the wisdom and knowledge that is in him only valuable things being hid,
or compared to hid treasure; that this cannot be had without knowing
him; that it is imperfect in the present state, and is not yet fully and
clearly revealed; and therefore should be inquired after, and searched
for, and Christ should be applied unto for it: , "treasures of wisdom",
is a phrase used by the Targumist (q),

\(q\) Jonathan ben Uzziel in Exod. xl. 4.

[Colossians 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">col 2:4</span></span>

And this I say,.... That he had such a conflict for them, and had told
them of his care and fear on their account, and had signified his great
desire that they might arrive to a more large and certain knowledge of
the mysteries of grace, and had asserted that all solid spiritual wisdom
and knowledge were in Christ; all which he said, to show his affection
for them; to observe unto them, that there was no need to seek for
wisdom and knowledge elsewhere, since there was such a fulness of it in
Christ, and the Gospel; and to put them upon their guard against false
teachers:

lest any man should beguile you with enticing words; by which are meant,
not apt and pertinent words, such as are suited to the minds of men, and
proper to convey right ideas of divine truth, poignant expressions,
sound speech, and strong reasonings; for such the apostle himself used,
and yet not enticing words of men's wisdom; and which design mere words,
great swelling words of vanity, which like bubbles look big, and make a
great noise, but contain nothing but wind and emptiness; fair speeches,
specious pretences, false colourings, fallacious reasonings, a show of
probability, and appearance of science, falsely so called; whereby
deceitful workers, such as the followers of Simon Magus and the
Gnostics, used, whom the apostle had in view; beguiled unstable souls,
and deceived the hearts of the simple: wherefore the apostle said the
above things, showing that all true wisdom was in Christ, and all
spiritual knowledge was in the pure and unmixed Gospel; which was not to
be parted with for other things, which through art and management, and
the cunning craftiness of men, might at first sight carry in them a show
of probability, and appearance of truth. The gold, the silver, and
precious stones of divine truths, which have been proved by the
standard, are not to be given up for such as only look like them, being
wrought up through the fallacy of men; who by a set of unmeaning words,
paralogisms, and false reasonings, lie in wait to deceive.

[Colossians 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">col 2:5</span></span>

For though I be absent in the flesh,.... Or body, as the Ethiopic
version reads it, and as it is expressed in [Co1
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#003.md); here the apostle anticipates an
objection which might be made, how he could have such a conflict and
concern for them, and express so much affection for them, and know so
much of their affairs, in what condition and situation they were, and
how liable to be deceived by false teachers, when he was absent from
them, and had never been among them. That he had never been corporeally
present with them, nor was he then, he owns; but this did not hinder but
that he might be in another sense present with them, and so have
cognizance of them and their state, and be affected towards them, and
concerned for them:

yet am I with you in the spirit; as he was with the Corinthians in the
place above cited, judging the incestuous person, determining concerning
his case, and delivering him up to Satan, and so he was with these
Colossians; for as he was a member of the same body with them, he was
actuated by the same spirit; and by virtue of their union to each other
in their common head, his spirit went out towards them, his heart was
knit unto them; he had the same affection for them, and care of them,
though he had never seen them with his bodily eyes, as he had for those
whom he had seen: moreover, this may regard that extraordinary
discerning and presence of his spirit which he had; and which was of the
same kind with that of Elisha, when his servant Gehazi went after Naaman
the Syrian, and took a present of him, to whom on his return he said,
upon his denying that he had been anywhere, "went not mine heart with
thee, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee?" [Kg2
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#026.md). Elisha's spirit went, and was
present with him, and saw and knew all that passed, being under the
impulse and inspiration of the Spirit of God, who made all known unto
him: so the spirit of the Apostle Paul was at the church at Colosse, and
saw: and discerned their whole estate; this being made known by the
Spirit of God, under whose inspiration he wrote this letter, suitable to
their case:

joying and beholding your order; or as the Syriac version renders it, "I
rejoice that I can see your order": that is, with pleasure observe,
consider it, and contemplate on it; and that partly from the relation of
Epaphras, and chiefly from the intimations of the Spirit of God in an
extraordinary way: by their "order" is meant, either their orderly walk
and conversation, which being as becomes the Gospel of Christ, was very
pleasing and delightful to the apostle; or rather the order of their
church discipline, they having regular officers, pastors, and deacons,
ordained among them; who rightly performed their offices, and had
respect and subjection yielded to them; the ordinances of the Gospel
were duly administered, and constantly attended on; the members of the
church were watched over, admonitions given, and censures laid where
they were necessary, and everything was done decently and in order;
which was a beautiful sight, and gave the apostle an uncommon pleasure.
The word used signifies a military order, such as is observed in armies,
in battle array; suggesting, that these Christians were good soldiers of
Christ, were enlisted under his banners, and kept in due order, in rank
and file; stood fast in one spirit, contended and strove together for
the faith of the Gospel, fought the good fight of faith, nor could any
hardship move them from their station; so that they were, in the
apostle's eye, beautiful as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, and terrible as
an army with banners, [Sol 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#004.md); and so
may denote their attachment to the Gospel, and to one another; they were
united to, and abode by each other; they served the Lord with one
consent, and kept the unity of the Spirit, in the bond of peace, [Eph
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#003.md), which is a pleasant thing to
behold, as well as what follows,

and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ; either in the grace of
faith, and the exercise of it on Christ, in opposition to doubtings and
unbelief; whereby God is honoured, and with which he is well pleased;
souls are filled with peace and joy; Satan is resisted and overcome; and
the hearts of others, particularly ministers of the Gospel, are
comforted: or in the doctrine of faith respecting Christ, in which they
stood fast; notwithstanding there was a majority against it, the wise
and learned, the rich and mighty, did not receive it; and though it was
opposed by false teachers, persecuted by profane men, and loaded with
reproach and obloquy; and also in the profession of it, which they held
without wavering: now to see a set of Christians, a church of Christ
walking together in Gospel order, steady in their faith on Christ,
abiding by the doctrine of faith, and maintaining an honourable
profession, how beautiful and delightful is it!

[Colossians 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">col 2:6</span></span>

As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord,.... Receiving
Christ is believing in him: faith is the eye of the soul, that sees the
beauty, glory, fulness, and suitableness of Christ; the foot that goes
to him, and the hand that takes hold on him, and the arm that receives
and embraces him; so that this is not a receiving him into the head by
notion, but into the heart by faith; and not in part only, but in whole:
faith receives a whole Christ, his person as God and man; him in all his
offices, as prophet, priest, and King; particularly as a Saviour and
Redeemer, he being under that character so exceeding suitable to the
case of a sensible sinner; and it receives all blessings of grace along
with him, from him, and through him; as a justifying righteousness,
remission of sins, adoption of children, grace for grace, and an
inheritance among all them that are sanctified; and both Christ and
them, as the free grace gifts of God; which men are altogether
undeserving of, and cannot possibly give any valuable consideration for:
so these Colossians had received Christ gladly, joyfully, willingly, and
with all readiness; and especially as "the Lord", on which there is a
peculiar emphasis in the text; they had received him and believed in
him, as the one and only Lord and head of the church; as the one and
only Mediator between God and man, to the exclusion of angels, the
worship of which the false teachers were introducing; they had received
the doctrines of Christ, and not the laws of Moses, which judaizing
preachers were desirous of joining with them; they had heard and obeyed
the Son, and not the servant; they had submitted to the authority of
Christ as King of saints, and had been subject to his ordinances;
wherefore the apostle exhorts them to continue and go on, believing in
him, and holding to him the head:

so walk ye in him; not only in imitation of him as he walked, in the
exercise of grace, as love, patience, humility, and meekness, and in the
discharge of duty; but by faith in him, going on in a way of believing
in him, always looking to him, leaning on him, and deriving grace and
strength from him: to walk in Christ, is to walk in and after the Spirit
of Christ, under his influence, by his direction, and through his
assistance; and to walk in the doctrine of Christ, abiding by it, and
increasing in the knowledge of it; and to walk in the ordinances of
Christ, which with ills presence and spirit, are ways of pleasantness
and paths of peace: particularly here it may signify, to make use of
Christ, and walk on in him, as the way, truth, and the life; as the only
way of access to God, and acceptance with him; as the way of salvation,
as the only true way to eternal life and happiness, in opposition to
every creature, angels, or men; the worshipping of the one, or works
done by the other.

[Colossians 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">col 2:7</span></span>

Rooted and built up in him,.... By these metaphors, the apostle
expresses the safe and happy state of these believers; and which he
makes use of as arguments, to engage them to walk on in Christ, and as
pointing out the manner in which they should. Believers are sometimes
compared to trees, and are trees of righteousness, the planting of the
Lord; and their root is Christ, from whence as such they spring, and by
whom they are filled with the fruits of righteousness; in him they are
to abide, keep close unto him, and walk in him; deriving all their life,
nourishment, fruitfulness, grace, and perseverance in it, from him as
their root: they are also sometimes compared to a building, to an house,
a temple, an habitation for God; and Christ is the sure and only
foundation on which they are laid, and where they are safe and secure;
and, being fitly joined together, grow up as an holy temple to the Lord;
and this being their case, they are to go on laying the whole stress of
their salvation on him, building their faith and hope of eternal glory
entirely upon him; and building up one another also on their most holy
faith, of which he is the substance, as it follows:

and stablished in the faith: that of Christ, or in the doctrine of faith
which respects Christ: the apostle here expresses the same thing without
a figure, which he had signified by the two foregoing metaphors, and
explains what he means by them; namely, that they were well settled and
grounded in their faith in Christ, and thoroughly instructed and
established in the doctrines of the Gospel; and a very good thing it is
to have the heart established with grace, both as a principle and a
doctrine; which is God's work, and was the happy case of these persons;
wherefore it became them to act as such, and not be like children tossed
to and fro with every wind of doctrine, or carried about with divers and
strange doctrines, but abide by those which had been preached to them by
the faithful ministers of Christ, and they had received: as

ye have been taught: by Epaphras their minister, and others; and
therefore should not listen to false teachers, and to a contrary
doctrine taught by them; considering of whom they had learnt the true
doctrine, what evidence it carried with it, and what use it had been of
to them, in convincing, converting, comforting, instructing, and
establishing them: and therefore should be

abounding therein with thanksgiving; that is, in the faith; as in the
grace, so in the doctrine of faith; for as saints are to abound in the
work of the Lord, and in every good work, and in the exercise of every
grace, so in the knowledge of truth; see [Co2
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#007.md); and to make use of all means for
the increase of, and growth in Gospel grace and light, and the knowledge
of a crucified Christ, which is meant by abounding: for all which there
is great reason for thanksgiving; both for the unspeakable gift of
Christ, who is received as such by faith, and in whom believers are
rooted and built up; and for faith itself, which is the gift of God; and
also for the Gospel, and the truths of it; and for every degree of
spiritual light in it, and knowledge of it.

[Colossians 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">col 2:8</span></span>

Beware lest any man spoil you,.... Or despoil you; rob you of the rich
treasure of the Gospel, strip you of your spiritual armour, take away
from you the truths and doctrines of Christ, and divest you of your
spiritual privileges and blessings; suggesting, that the false teachers
were thieves and robbers, and men of prey: or drive and carry you away
as spoils, as the innocent harmless sheep are drove, and carried away by
wolves, and by the thief that comes to steal, to kill, and destroy;
intimating, that such as these were the heretics of those times;
wherefore it became them to be upon their guard, to watch, look out, and
beware, lest they should be surprised by these deceitful workers, who
lay in wait to deceive; were wolves in sheep's clothing, who transformed
themselves into the apostles of Christ; and therefore it became them to
take heed, lest any man hurt them, be he ever so wise and learned, or be
thought ever so good, religious, and sincere; since men of this cast put
on such masks and false appearances, on purpose to beguile. The things
by which they imposed upon weak minds are as follow, and therefore to be
shunned, avoided, and rejected:

through philosophy: not right philosophy, or true wisdom, the knowledge
of God, of the things of nature, of things natural, moral, and civil;
which may be attained unto by the use of reason, and light of nature.
The apostle does not mean to condemn all arts and sciences, as useless
and hurtful, such as natural philosophy in its various branches, ethics,
logic, rhetoric, &c. when kept within due bounds, and in their proper
place and sphere; for with instances of these the Scriptures themselves
abound; but he means that philosophy, or science, which is falsely so
called, the false notions of philosophers; such as the eternity of
matter, and of this world, the mortality of souls, the worshipping of
demons and angels, &c. and also such principles in philosophy, which in
themselves, and in the things of nature, are true, but, when applied to
divine things, to things above nature, the mere effects of divine power
and grace, and of pure revelation, are false; as that out of nothing,
nothing can be made, which in the things of nature is true, but not to
be applied to the God of nature, who has made the world out of nothing;
as also that from a privation to an habit there is no return, which is
naturally true, but not to be applied to supernatural things, and
supernatural agency; witness the miracles of Christ, in restoring sight
to the blind, life to the dead, &c. and therefore is not to be employed
against the resurrection of the dead: philosophy may be useful as an
handmaid; it is not to be a mistress in theological things; it may
subserve, but not govern; it is not to be made use of as a judge, or
rule in such matters; the natural man, on these principles, neither
knows nor receives the things of the Spirit of God; judgment is not to
be made and formed according to them; as of a trinity of persons in the
Godhead; of the sonship of Christ, and his incarnation; of man's
redemption by him, of reconciliation and satisfaction by his blood and
sacrifice, of the pardon of sin, of a sinner's justification, of the
resurrection of the dead, and such like articles of faith: that
philosophy which is right, can only be a rule of judgment in things
relating to it, and not in those which are out of its sphere: in a word,
the apostle here condemns the philosophy of the Jews, and of the
Gnostics; the former had introduced natural philosophy into the worship
and service of God, and the things appertaining to their religion; and
had made the tabernacle and temple, and the most holy place, and the
things belonging thereunto, emblems and hieroglyphics of natural things;
as of the sun, moon, and stars, and their influences, and of the four
elements, and of moral virtue, &c. as appears from the writings of
Josephus (r), and Philo (s); when they were types and representatives of
spiritual things under the Gospel dispensation; and the latter had
brought in the philosophy of Pythagoras and Plato, concerning
abstinences, purgations, sacrifices, and ceremonies of worship, given to
demons and angels: in short, the apostle's meaning is, that philosophy
is not to be mixed with the pure Gospel of Christ; it has always been
fatal to it; witness the school of Pantaenus in Alexandria, in the early
times of Christianity, by which the simplicity of the Gospel was greatly
corrupted; and the race of schoolmen a few centuries ago, who introduced
the philosophy of Aristotle, Averrois, and others, into all the subjects
of divinity: to observe no more, such kind of philosophy is here meant,
which may be truly called

vain deceit: that is, that which is vain and empty, and has no solid
foundation, even in nature and reason itself; and which being applied to
divine things and religious observances, is deceitful and delusory:

after the tradition of men; either of the Gentiles, who had their
traditions in religion; or of the Jews, called the traditions of the
elders, and of the fathers, which the Pharisees were fond of, by which
they transgressed the commandments of God; which the apostle was brought
up in, and was zealous of formerly, but now was delivered from, and
rightly condemned as idle, trifling, and pernicious:

after the rudiments of the world, or "the elements of the world"; not
the four elements of earth, air, fire, and water; or the worship of the
sun, moon, and stars, &c. among the idolatrous Gentiles, but the
ceremonial laws of the Jews; see [Gal
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#008.md); which were that to them in
religion, as the A B C, or letters, are in grammar, the elements and
rudiments of it; and though these were to them, when children, useful,
but now under the Gospel dispensation are weak, beggarly, and useless,
and not to be attended to:

and not after Christ; what he has taught and prescribed, the doctrines
and commandments of Christ, the treasures of wisdom and knowledge which
are in him; and therefore all such vain and deceitful philosophy, human
traditions, and worldly rudiments, are to be rejected; Christ and his
Gospel, the revelation he has made, are the standard of doctrine and
worship; he only is to be heard and attended to, and whatever it
contrary thereunto is to be guarded against,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">col 2:9</span></span>

For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. This is to be
understood, not of the doctrine, or Gospel of Christ, as being a perfect
revelation of the will of God; but of Christ, and particularly of his
human nature, as consisting of a true body and a reasonable soul, in
which the Godhead dwells in a most eminent manner: God indeed is
everywhere by his powerful presence, was in the tabernacle and temple in
a very singular manner, and dwells in the saints in a way of special
grace; but resides in the human nature of Christ, in the highest and
most exalted manner; that is to deity what the human body is to an human
soul, it is the house in which it dwells: so Philo the Jew (t) calls the
"Logos" the house of God, who is the soul of the universe; and elsewhere
says (u), that God himself has filled the divine Logos wholly with
incorporeal powers. The Godhead dwells in Christ as in a tabernacle, in
allusion to the tabernacle of Moses, which looked mean without side, but
glorious within; where God granted his presence, and accepted the
sacrifices of his people; the human nature of Christ is the true
antitypical tabernacle, which God pitched, and not man; and sometimes is
called a temple, in allusion to Solomon's; and which is filled with the
train of the divine perfections, signified by fulness here: for not the
fulness of grace, or a communicative fulness, is here meant; nor the
relative fulness, the church; but the fulness of the divine nature, of
all the perfections of deity, such as eternity, immensity, omnipresence,
omnipotence, omniscience, immutability, necessary and self existence,
and every other; for if anyone perfection was wanting, the fulness, much
less all the fulness of the Godhead, would not be in him. The act of
inhabitation denotes the union of the two natures in Christ, and
expresses the distinction of them; and is to be understood of the
Godhead, as subsisting in the person of the Son of God, and not as
subsisting in the person of the Father, or of the Spirit; and shows the
permanency of this union, it is a perpetual abiding one; and this
fulness is not dependent on the Father's pleasure; it is not said of
this as of another fulness, [Col 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#019.md);
that it pleased the Father that it should dwell in him: the manner in
which it dwells, is "bodily"; not by power, as in the universe; nor by
grace, as in the saints; nor by any glorious emanations of it, as in
heaven; nor by gifts, as in the prophets and eminent men of God; nor by
signs symbols, and shadows, as in the tabernacle and temple; but
essentially and personally, or by personal union of the divine nature,
as subsisting in the Son of God to an human body, chosen and prepared
for that purpose, together with a reasonable human soul; which is the
great mystery of godliness, the glory of the Christian religion, and
what qualified Christ for, and recommends him to us as a Saviour; and is
a reason why, as these words are, that the Gospel should be abode by,
continued in, and that with thankfulness: nor should any regard be had
to vain and deceitful philosophy, to the traditions of men, or rudiments
of the world: Christ only is to be looked to, attended, and followed,
who has all fulness in him,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">col 2:10</span></span>

And ye are complete in him,.... Or "filled up", or "filled full" in him;
that is, are perfect in him: saints are in Christ, and all fulness being
in him, they are full too, of as much as they stand in need, and are
capable of containing: for these words are not an exhortation to
perfection, as the Arabic version reads then, be ye complete in him,
like those in [Gen 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#001.md); but are an
affirmation, asserting not what the saints shall be hereafter, or in
heaven, but what they now are; not in themselves, for in themselves none
are perfect, not even those who are truly sanctified; for though all
grace is seminally implanted in them, and they have a perfection of
parts, of all the parts of the new man, or new creature, and are perfect
in comparison of what they sometimes were, and of profane persons and
hypocrites, and with respect to weaker believers, yet none are
absolutely perfect; the good work of grace is not yet finished in them,
sin dwells in them, they are full of wants and complaints; the best of
them disclaim perfection as attained to by them, and express their
desires of it; but they are perfect in Christ their head, who has all
fulness in him, in whom they are chosen and blessed: they are complete
and perfect in him as to sanctification; he having all fulness of grace
and holiness for them, they have it in him; and he is made perfect
sanctification to them: and as to justification, he has perfectly
fulfilled the law for them, he has made full atonement for sin, has
obtained eternal redemption, brought in a complete and perfect
righteousness, by which they are justified from all things; are freed
from sin, and made perfectly comely, without spot or wrinkle, or any
such thing: and as to knowledge, though it is imperfect in them in their
present state, yet in Christ all the treasures of it are, and they have
no need to go elsewhere for any; they are filled with the knowledge of
God and of his will, and are complete therein in Christ; and what
knowledge they have, is eternal life, the beginning, pledge, and earnest
of it; so that they have no reason to be beholden to angels or men, only
to Christ:

which is the head of all principality and power; not only of the body
the church, and who is to be held unto as such, from whom all light,
life, grace, and strength, are to be derived; but of all others, though
in a different sense; and not only of the kings, princes, and potentates
of this world, who hold their kingdoms, and receive their crowns from
him, and rule by him; but also of the angels, good and bad, often called
principalities and powers; especially the former is here meant, of whom
Christ is head, being their Creator, Governor, and upholder; who not
only maintains them in their beings, but has confirmed them in their
state of holiness; so that they are dependent upon him, and beholden to
him for all they have and are: with the Jews, "Metatron", which with
them is the name of the angel in [Exo
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020.md) and seems to be a corruption of
the word "mediator", and to design the Messiah, is said (w) to be King
over all the angels. This is mentioned, partly to set forth the glory
and excellency of Christ; and partly against worshipping of angels,
making use of them as mediators, or applying to them on any account,
since Christ is the head of these, and of every creature; therefore no
creature is to be looked and applied unto, trusted and depended on:
unless rather should be meant the Jewish rulers, Scribes, and Pharisees,
their doctors, wise men, and Rabbins, called the princes of this world;
the Jews' tutors and governors, to whom Christ is superior; he is the
only master and Father, and in whom perfection of wisdom is, and not in
them; and therefore should not regard them, their vain philosophy,
worldly rudiments and traditions,

[Colossians 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">col 2:11</span></span>

In whom also ye are circumcised,.... This is said to prevent an
objection that might be made to the perfection of these Gentile
believers, because they were not circumcised; for the Jews thought that
perfection lay in circumcision, at least that there could be no
perfection without it:

"great is circumcision (say they (x)), for notwithstanding all the
commands which Abraham our father did, he was not called perfect until
he was circumcised; as it is written, [Gen
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#001.md); "walk before me, and be thou
perfect:"

which objection the apostle anticipates, by observing, that they were
circumcised in Christ their head, who is made unto them sanctification;
and by him as the meritorious and efficient cause of their regeneration
and conversion, or internal circumcision, the antitype and perfection of
circumcision in the flesh; for the former, and not the latter, is here
meant: these believers were circumcised in Christ, or by him; not with
external circumcision, which was peculiar to the Jews, the natural seed
of Abraham, prefigured Christ, and had its accomplishment in him, the
body and substance of all the shadows of the ceremonial law; and so was
now nothing, either to Jew or Gentile: as for the Gentiles, they never
were obliged unto it; and as for the Jews, it was an insupportable yoke
to them, binding them to keep the whole law of Moses, which they could
not do, and so it made nothing perfect; but Christ the substance of
that, and the end of the whole law, has, the head of the body the
church, in whom all the members of it are complete, and are circumcised:

with the circumcision made without hands: which is that of the heart, in
the spirit; every man, though he may be circumcised in the flesh, is
uncircumcised in heart, until he is circumcised by Christ and his
Spirit; which is done, when he is pricked to the heart, and thoroughly
convinced of sin, and the exceeding sinfulness of it; when the
callousness and hardness of his heart is taken off and removed, and the
iniquity of it is, laid open, the plague and corruption in it discerned,
and all made naked and bare to the sinner's view; and when he is in pain
on account of it, is broken and groans under a sense of it, and is
filled with shame for it, and loathing and abhorrence of it: now this is
effected not "by the hand of man", as the Ethiopic version reads it, as
outward circumcision was; this is not done by any creature whatever; not
by angels, who rejoice at the repentance of sinners, but cannot produce
it; nor by ministers of the Gospel, who at most are but instruments of
regeneration and conversion; nor by men themselves; this is not by might
or power of man, by the strength of his free will, but by the Spirit of
God: for though men are sometimes exhorted to circumcise themselves, as
in [Deu 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#016.md), in order to convince
them of the corruption of their nature, and the need they stand in of
spiritual circumcision; yet whereas there is an utter disability in them
to effect it, and they need the power and grace of God for that purpose,
the Lord has graciously promised his people to do it himself for them,
[Deu 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#006.md); so that this circumcision
is in the name sense made without hands, as the human nature of Christ
is said to be a tabernacle not made with hands, that, is of men, but of
God, being what God has pitched, and not man; and it stands opposed to
circumcision in the flesh, which was made with hands, [Eph
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#011.md); and by some instrument, as a
sharp knife or stone:

in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh. The Vulgate Latin
version leaves out the word "sins", and so the Alexandrian copy and some
others; and the Syriac version the word "body": by "the flesh" is meant
corrupt nature, which is born of the flesh, and propagated in a carnal
way, and is the source and spring of all sin; by "the sins" of it are
intended the works of the flesh, the inward motions of sin in the
members, and the outward actions of it: these are said to be a "body",
because sin consists of various parts and members, as a body does; and
these united together, and which receive frequent and daily additions;
and which are committed and yielded to by the members of the natural
body; and which body and bulk of sins arising from the corruption of
nature are compared to a garment, and a very filthy one it is; in the
putting off of which lies spiritual circumcision: this is done several
ways; partly by Christ's wrapping himself in the sins of his people,
bearing them in his body, and becoming a sacrifice for them, whereby the
old man was crucified, and the body of sin destroyed; and by an
application of his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice, to the
consciences of his people, whereby their iniquities are caused to pass
from them, and they are clothed with change of raiment; and by the power
of his Spirit, laying sin under the restraints of grace, not suffering
it to have dominion, but causing grace to reign through righteousness;
and by the saints themselves, under the influence of grace, who put off
the old man with his deeds, according to the former conversation:

by the circumcision of Christ; not that with which Christ was
circumcised at eight days old, that he might appear to be truly man, and
a son of Abraham, and under the law, and to fulfil all the righteousness
of it, but that which he by his Spirit is the author of, and what is
before expressed,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">col 2:12</span></span>

Buried with him in baptism,.... The apostle goes on to observe how
complete and perfect the saints are in Christ; that they are not only
circumcised in him in a spiritual sense, and the body of the sins of
their flesh is put off, and removed from them, in allusion to the
cutting off and casting away of the foreskin in circumcision; but that
they and all their sins were buried with Christ, of which their baptism
in water was a lively representation: Christ having died for their sins,
was laid in the grave, where he continued for a while, and then rose
again; and as they were crucified with him, they were also buried with
him, as their head and representative; and all their sins too, which he
left behind him in the grave, signified by his grave clothes there; and
baptism being performed by immersion, when the person baptized is
covered with water, and as it were buried in it, is a very significant
emblem of all this; it is a representation of the burial of Christ, and
very fitly holds him forth to the view of faith in the state of the
dead, in the grave, and points out the place where the Lord lay; and it
is also a representation of our burial with him, as being dead to sin,
to the law, and to the world, by him. This shows now, that baptism was
performed by dipping, or covering the whole body in water, for no other
form of administration of baptism, as sprinkling, or pouring water on
the face, can represent a burial, or be called one; and this is what
many learned interpreters own, and observe on this place:

wherein also ye are risen with him; Christ is risen from the dead as the
head and representative of his people, and they are risen with him; and
their baptism is also an emblem of his and their resurrection, being
administered by immersion, in which way only this can be signified; for
as the going down into the water, and being under it, represents
Christ's descending into the state of the dead, and his continuance in
it, so the emersion, or coming up out of the water, represents his
rising from the dead, and that of his people in him, in order to walk in
newness of life; for the apostle's meaning is, that in baptism saints
are risen with Christ, as well as in it buried with him: and this

through the faith of the operation of God; that is, it is through faith
that saints see themselves buried and risen with Christ, to which the
ordinance of baptism is greatly assisting, where there is true faith;
for otherwise, without faith, this ordinance will be of no use to any
such end and purpose; and it is not any faith that will avail, but that
which is of God's operation; faith is not naturally in men, all men have
it not; and those that have it, have it not of themselves, it is the
gift of God; it is what be works in them, and by his power performs:

who hath raised him from the dead; this is a periphrasis of God the
Father, to whom the resurrection of Christ from the dead is generally
ascribed; though not to the exclusion of Christ, and of the Spirit, who
were also concerned; and is here added, partly to show in what respect
faith, which is God's work, has him for its object, as having raised
Christ from the dead, who was delivered for offences, but is risen again
through the power of God for justification, and whoever with his heart
believes this shall be saved; and partly to show, that the same power is
exerted in working true faith in the heart, as was put forth in raising
Christ from the dead.

[Colossians 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">col 2:13</span></span>

And you being dead in your sins,.... Not corporeally, though sin had
subjected them to a corporeal death, and their bodies were really
mortal, and in a little time must die; but morally, sin had brought a
death upon them in a moral sense, they were separated from God, as at
death the body is from the soul, and so were alienated from the life of
God, and consequently must be dead; they had lost the image of God,
which consisted in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness; and were dead
as to the understanding of what was good, as to their affections for it,
or will and capacity to do it; and, like dead men, were insensible of
their state, their sin, and misery; and altogether inactive and helpless
in spiritual things, being destitute of spiritual life, strength, and
motion; and were moreover in themselves deserving of eternal death, and
according to the law of works, under the sentence of it, and so liable
and exposed unto it; and all this for, and on account of their sins,
their actual sins and transgressions here meant; which separated them
from God, deformed his image in them, and hardened their hearts, that
they had no true sight and sense of themselves; as also on account of
the corruption of their nature, signified in the next clause:

and the uncircumcision of your flesh; which is to be taken not
literally, for the prepuce, or foreskin of their flesh, which was a sign
and token of the corruption of nature, but figuratively that itself; it
being usual with the Jews to call the vitiosity of nature
"uncircumcision"; which, they say (y), is one of the seven names of ,
"the evil imagination", or corrupt nature, denoting the pollution,
loathsomeness, and abominableness of it:

hath he quickened together with him; that is, with Christ; this may be
understood either of the quickening of them in conversion and
sanctification; for as they were dead in sin in a moral sense, in
conversion a principle of life was implanted in them, or grace, as a
living principle, was wrought in their souls by the Spirit of life from
Christ; so that they could see their lost state, their need of Christ,
the glory of his person and righteousness, the fulness and suitableness
of his grace; feel their burdens, and handle the word of life; could
hear the Gospel, speak the language of Canaan, breathe in prayer and
spiritual desires, walk in Christ, and do all things through him; and
this was God's act and not theirs, and owing to his rich mercy and great
love: and this may be said to be done "with Christ", because this is in
consequence of his being quickened, or raised from the dead; and by it
they were made partakers of the life of Christ, they became one spirit
with him; and it was not so much they that lived, but Christ lived in
them; and besides, they were quickened, in order to live a life of grace
and communion with him here, and of glory hereafter: or it may be
interpreted of the quickening of them in justification; and the rather,
because of what is said in the next clause; and that either openly, as
when a sinner is convinced that he is dead in a legal sense, and faith
is wrought in him to behold pardon and righteousness in Christ; upon
which he prays for the one, and pleads the other; and the Spirit of God
seals unto him the pardon of his sins, brings near the righteousness of
Christ, enables him to lay hold on it as his, and pronounces him
justified by it; and may well be called justification of life, for he is
then alive in a legal sense, in his own comfortable view and
apprehension of things: or secretly in Christ, as the head and
representative of all his people; who when he was quickened, they were
quickened with him; when he rose from the dead, they rose with him; and
when he was justified, they were instilled in him, and this seems to be
the true sense of this passage:

having forgiven you all trespasses. This was a past act, being done and
over; not only at first conversion, when a discovery of it was made, but
at the death of Christ, whose blood was shed for the remission of sin;
yea, even as early as Christ became a surety, when the sins of his
people were not imputed to them, but to him: and this was a single act,
and done and complete at once; forgiveness of sin is not done by
piecemeals, or at different times, or by divers acts, but is done at
once, and includes sin past, present, and to come; and is universal,
reaches to all sin, original and actual, before and after conversion;
sins of thought, word, and action: and this is God's act, and his only;
not men, nor ministers, nor angels, can forgive sin; this is the
peculiar prerogative of God, and is owing to his abundant mercy and free
grace, and which is signified by the word here used. The Syriac and
Arabic versions read, "having forgiven us all our trespasses"; and so
the Alexandrian copy, and some others, read "us" instead of "you",

Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances,.... Various are the senses
interpreters give of these words; some think by the handwriting is meant
the covenant God made with Adam, [Gen
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#017.md), which being broken, obliged him
and all his posterity to the penalty of death, but is cancelled and
abolished by Christ; others, the agreement which the Israelites made
with God at Mount Sinai, when they said, "all that the Lord hath said
will we do, and be obedient", [Exo
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#007.md); which was as it were setting
their hands, and laying themselves under obligation to obedience, and,
in case of failure, to the penalty of the law; others, God's book of
remembrance of the sins of men, out of which they are blotted when
pardoned; others, the book of conscience, which bears witness to every
debt, to every violation and transgression of the law, which may be said
to be blotted out, when pacified with an application of the blood and
righteousness of Christ; rather with others it signifies the ceremonial
law, which lay in divers ordinances and commands, and is what, the
apostle afterwards speaks of more clearly and particularly; and may be
called so, because submission to it was an acknowledgment both of the
faith and guilt of sin; every washing was saying, that a man was
polluted and unclean; and every sacrifice was signing a man's own guilt
and condemnation, and testifying that he deserved to die as the creature
did, which was offered in sacrifice: or rather the whole law of Moses is
intended, which was the handwriting of God, and obliged to obedience to
it, and to punishment in case of disobedience; and this the Jews (z)
call , "the writing of the debt", and is the very phrase the Syriac
version uses here: now this was as a debt book, which showed and
testified the debts of men; that is, their sins, how many they are
guilty of, and what punishment is due unto them: and may well be said to
be that

that was against us, which was contrary to us; its nature being holy,
just, good, and spiritual, is contrary to the unholy and carnal heart of
man, and its commands disagreeable to his mind and will; nor can he
perform what it requires; nor can he be subject to it without the grace
of God, any more than he can like its precepts; and besides, it is
contrary to him, and against him, as it charges him with debts, and
proves them upon him, so that he has nothing to say in his defence; yea,
it proceeds against him, and curses and condemns, and kills him: but God
has "blotted" it out, Christ having engaged as a surety for his people,
to pay off all their debts; and this being done by him, God has crossed
the debt book of the law, has blotted it out, so that this book is of no
force; it does not stand against these persons, it cannot show or prove
any standing debt, it cannot demand any, or inflict any penalty: nay, he
has

took it out of the way; it is not to be seen or looked into as a debt
book; it is abolished and done away; it is no more as administered by
Moses, as a covenant of works, or as to its rigorous exaction, curse,
and condemnation; this is true of the whole law of Moses, as well as of
the ceremonial, which is utterly abolished and disannulled in every
sense, because of the weakness and unprofitableness of it:

nailing it to his cross: to the cross of Christ, showing that the
abolition of it is owing to the cross of Christ; where and when he bore
the curse and penalty of the law for his people, as well as answered all
the types and shadows of it: it is thought to be an allusion to a custom
in some countries, to cancel bonds, or antiquate edicts and decrees, by
driving a nail through them, so that they could not be legible any more:
or it may be to the writing of Pilate, which contained the charge and
accusation against Christ; and which was placed over his head upon the
cross, and fastened to it with nails (a); every nail in the cross made a
scissure in this handwriting, or bond of the law, that lay against us,
whereby it was so rent and torn, as to be of no force: thus the Holy
Ghost makes use of various expressions, to show that there is nothing in
the law standing against the saints; it is blotted out, and cannot be
read; it is took away, and cannot be seen; it is nailed to the cross of
Christ, and is torn to pieces thereby, that nothing can ever be produced
from it to their hurt and condemnation,

And having spoiled principalities and powers,.... Principalities of
hell, the infernal powers of darkness, the devil that had the power of
death, the accuser of the brethren, who often objected their debts, with
all his works and posse: these Christ has divested of their armour,
wherein they trusted to have ruined men, as sin, the law, and death; he
has ransomed his people from him that was stronger than they, and taken
the prey out of the hands of the mighty; he has bruised the serpent's
head, demolished his works, destroyed him himself, and all his powers,
and defeated all their counsels and designs against his elect: some
render the word "having put off", or "unclothed": and which some of the
ancient writers apply to the flesh of Christ, and understand it of his
putting off the flesh by death, whereby he gave the death blow to Satan
and his powers, [Heb 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014.md), to which
sense agrees the Syriac version, which renders the words, , "and by the
putting off of his body, he exposed to shame principalities and powers":
but it may be better interpreted of unclothing, or stripping
principalities and powers of their armour, with which they were clothed;
as is usually done to enemies, when they fall into the hands of their
conquerors: unless rather this is to be understood of Christ's taking
away the power and authority of the Jewish ecclesiastical rulers and
governors, by abolishing the ceremonial law, and the ordinances of it;
declaring himself to be the alone King and Lawgiver in his house, and
requiring subjection to his institutions and appointments, which sense
agrees with the context:

he made a show of them openly; when being raised from the dead, he
ascended on high, and led captivity captive; he led Satan and his
principalities and powers captive, who had led others, as he passed
through the air, the territories of the devil, in the sight of God and
the holy angels:

triumphing over them in it; which some understand of the cross, as if
where and by what he got the victory, there he triumphed; the cross,
where his enemies thought to make a show of him, expose him to public
scorn and contempt, and to triumph over him, was as it were the
triumphant chariot, in which he triumphed over all the powers of hell,
when he had conquered them by it: but the words may be rendered "in
himself", as they are by the Vulgate Latin and Syriac versions; and the
sense be, that as he by himself got the victory, his own arm brought
salvation to him, so he alone shared the glory and honour of the
triumph: or it may be rendered "in him", and the whole in this and the
preceding verse be applied to God the Father, who, as in [Col
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#012.md); is said to raise Christ from the
dead, to quicken sinners dead in sins, and to forgive all their
trespasses; so he may be said to blot out the handwriting of ordinances,
and to spoil principalities and powers, expose them to public view and
shame, and triumph over them, "in him", in and by his Son Jesus Christ:
the whole is an allusion to the victories, spoils, and triumphs, of the
Roman emperors, who when they had obtained a victory, a triumph was
decreed for them by the senate; in which the emperor was drawn in an
open chariot, and the captives being stripped of their armour, and their
hands tied behind them, were led before him and exposed to public view
and disgrace; while he was shouted and huzzaed through the city of Rome,
and had all the marks of honour and respect given him (b): now all that
is said in the preceding verses show how complete the saints are in and
by Christ; and stand in no need of the philosophy of the Gentiles, or
the ceremonies of the Jews; nor have anything to fear from their
enemies, sin, Satan, and the law, for sin is pardoned, the law is
abolished, and Satan conquered,

[Colossians 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">col 2:16</span></span>

Let no man therefore judge you,.... Since they were complete in Christ,
had everything in him, were circumcised in him; and particularly since
the handwriting of the law was blotted out, and torn to pieces through
the nails of the cross of Christ, the apostle's conclusion is, that they
should be judged by no man; they should not regard or submit to any
man's judgment, as to the observance of the ceremonial law: Christ is
the prophet who was to be raised up like unto Moses, and who only, and
not Moses, is to be heard; saints are to call no man master upon earth
but him; they are not to be the servants of men, nor should suffer any
yoke of bondage to be imposed upon them; and should they be suffered and
condemned by others, as if they were transgressors of the law, and their
state bad, for not observing the rituals of the former dispensation,
they should not regard such censures, for the judaizing Christians were
very censorious, they were ready to look upon and condemn a man as an
immoral man, as in a state of damnation, if he did not keep the law of
Moses; but such rigid censures were to be disregarded, "let no man
judge", or "condemn you"; and though they could not help or hinder the
judgment and condemnation of men, yet they could despise them, and not
be uneasy with them, but set light by them, as they ought to do. The
Syriac version renders it, "let no man trouble you", or make you uneasy,
by imposing ceremonies on you: the sense is, that the apostle would not
have them submit to the yoke they would lay upon them, nor be terrified
by their anathemas against them, for the non-observation of the things
that follow:

in meat or in drink; or on account of not observing the laws and rules
about meats and drinks, in the law of Moses; such as related to the
difference between clean and unclean creatures, to abstinence in
Nazarites from wine and strong drink, and which forbid drinking out of
an uncovered vessel, and which was not clean; hence the washing of cups,
&c. religiously observed by the Pharisees. There was no distinction of
meats and drinks before the law, but all sorts of herbs and animals,
without limitation, were given to be food for men; by the ceremonial law
a difference was made between them, some were allowed, and others were
forbidden; which law stood only in meats and drinks, and such like
things, but is now abolished; for the kingdom of God, or the Gospel
dispensation, does not lie in the observance of such outward things, but
in internal ones, in righteousness and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost;
it is not any thing that goes into the man that defiles, nor is anything
in its own nature common or unclean, but every creature of God is good,
so be it, it be used in moderation and with thankfulness:

or in respect of an holyday; or feast, such as the feast of the
passover, the feast of tabernacles, and the feast of Pentecost; which
were three grand festivals, at which all the Jewish males were obliged
to appear before the Lord; but were never binding upon the Gentiles, and
were what the Christians under the Gospel dispensation had nothing to do
with, and even believing Jews were freed from them, as having had their
accomplishment in Christ; and therefore were not to be imposed upon
them, or they condemned for the neglect of them. The phrase , which we
render "in respect", has greatly puzzled interpreters; some reading it
"in part of a feast"; or holyday; as if the sense was, that no man
should judge or condemn them, for not observing some part of a festival,
since they were not obliged to observe any at all: others "in the
partition", or "division of a feast"; that is, in the several distinct
feasts, as they come in their turns: some (c) think the apostle respects
the Misna, or oral law of the Jews, in which are several treatises
concerning a good day, or an holyday, the beginning of the new year, and
the sabbath, which treatises are divided into sections or chapters; and
that it is one of these sections or chapters, containing rules about
these things, that is here regarded; and then the sense is, let no man
judge you or condemn you, for your non-observance of feast days, new
moons, and sabbaths, by any part, chapter, or section, of , or by
anything out of the treatise "concerning a feast day"; or by any part,
chapter, or section, of , the treatise "concerning the beginning of the
year"; or by any part, chapter, or section, of the treatise "concerning
the sabbath"; and if these treatises are referred to, it proves the
antiquity of the Misna. The Syriac version renders it, , "in the
divisions of the feast": frequent mention is made of , "the division",
or "half of the feast", in the Jewish writings: thus for instance it is
said (d),

"three times in a year they clear the chamber (where the half-shekels
were put), "in the half", or middle of the passover, in the middle of
Pentecost, and in the middle of the feast.

again (e).

"there are three times for tithing of beasts, in the middle of the
passover, in the middle of Pentecost, and the middle of the feast;

that is, of tabernacles: and this, the Jewish commentators say (f), was
fifteen days before each of these festivals: now whether it was to this,
"middle", or "half space", before each and any of these feasts the
apostle refers to, may be considered:

or of the new moon; which the Jews were obliged to observe, by attending
religious worship, and offering sacrifices; see [Num
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#011.md) [Kg2
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#023.md).

Or of the sabbath days, or "sabbaths"; meaning the jubilee sabbath,
which was one year in fifty; and the sabbath of the land, which was one
year in seven; and the seventh day sabbath, and some copies read in the
singular number, "or of the sabbath"; which were all peculiar to the
Jews, were never binding on the Gentiles, and to which believers in
Christ, be they who they will, are by no means obliged; nor ought they
to observe them, the one any more than the other; and should they be
imposed upon them, they ought to reject them; and should they be judged,
censured, and condemned, for so doing, they ought not to mind it. It is
the sense of the Jews themselves, that the Gentiles are not obliged to
keep their sabbath; no, not the proselyte of the gate, or he that dwelt
in any of their cities; for they say (g), that "it is lawful for a
proselyte of the gate to do work on the sabbath day for himself, as for
an Israelite on a common feast day; R. Akiba says, as for all Israelite
on a feast day; R. Jose says, it is lawful for a proselyte of the gate
to do work on the sabbath day for himself, as for an Israelite on a
common or week day:

and this last is the received sense of the nation; nay, they assert that
a Gentile that keeps a sabbath is guilty of death (h); see Gill on [Mar
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#027). Yea, they say (i.md), that "if a
Gentile sabbatizes, or keeps a sabbath, though on any of the days of the
week, if he makes or appoints it as a sabbath for himself, he is guilty
of the same.

It is the general sense of that people, that the sabbath was peculiarly
given to the children of Israel; and that the Gentiles, strangers, or
others, were not punishable for the neglect and breach of it (k); that
it is a special and an additional precept, which, with some others, were
given them at Marah, over and above the seven commands, which the sons
of Noah were only obliged to regard (l); and that the blessing and
sanctifying of it were by the manna provided for that day; and that the
passage in [Gen 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#003.md); refers not to the
then present time, but , "to time to come", to the time of the manna

Which are a shadow of things to come,.... By Christ, and under the
Gospel dispensation; that is, they were types, figures, and
representations of spiritual and evangelical things: the different
"meats and drinks", clean and unclean, allowed or forbidden by the law,
were emblems of the two people, the Jews and Gentiles, the one clean,
the other unclean; but since these are become one in Christ, the
distinction of meats is ceased, these shadows are gone; and also of the
different food of regenerate and unregenerate souls, the latter feeding
on impure food, the ashes and husks of sensual lusts, or their own
works, the former on the milk and meat in the Gospel, the wholesome
words of Christ; and likewise the clean meat was a shadow of Christ
himself, whose flesh is meat indeed, and whose blood is drink indeed.
The "holy days", or "feasts" of the Jews, the feasts of tabernacles, of
the passover and Pentecost, were types of Christ; the feast of
tabernacles, though it was in remembrance of the Israelites dwelling in
tents and booths when they came out of Egypt, yet was also a
representation of the people of God dwelling in the earthly houses of
their tabernacles here on earth; and particularly of Christ's dwelling,
or tabernacling in human nature, and who likewise was born at the time
of this feast; See Gill on . The passover, as it was a commemoration of
the deliverance of the Israelites out of Egypt, and of God's passing
over their houses when he smote the firstborn of the Egyptians, so it
was a type of Christ our passover sacrificed for us, and was kept by
Moses in the faith of him, [Heb 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#028.md);
there is a very great resemblance, in many particulars, between Christ
and the paschal lamb; See Gill on [Co1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#007.md). The feast of Pentecost, or the
feast of harvest and firstfruits, was a shadow of the firstfruits of the
Spirit, which Christ having received, gave to his disciples on that day;
and of the harvest of souls to be gathered under the Gospel
dispensation, of which the conversion of the three thousand on the day
of Pentecost was an earnest and pledge. The "new moon" was typical of
the church, which is fair as the moon, and receives all her light from
Christ the sun of righteousness; and of the renewed state of the church
under the Gospel dispensation, when the old things of the law are passed
away, and all things relating to church order, ordinances, and
discipline, are become new. The "sabbaths" were also shadows of future
things; the grand sabbatical year, or the fiftieth year sabbath, or
jubilee, in which liberty was proclaimed throughout the land, a general
release of debts, and restoration of inheritances, prefigured the
liberty we have by Christ from sin, Satan, and the law, the payment of
all our debts by Christ, and the right we have through him to the
heavenly and incorruptible inheritance. The seventh year sabbath, in
which there was no tilling of the land, no ploughing, sowing, nor
reaping, was an emblem of salvation through Christ by free grace, and
not by the works of men; and the seventh day sabbath was a type of that
spiritual rest we have in Christ now, and of that eternal rest we shall
have with him in heaven hereafter: now these were but shadows, not real
things; or did not contain the truth and substance of the things
themselves, of which they were shadows; and though they were
representations of divine and spiritual things, yet dark ones, they had
not so much as the very image of the things; they were but shadows, and
like them fleeting and passing away, and now are gone:

but the body is of Christ: or, as the Syriac version reads it, "the body
is Christ"; that is, the body, or sum and substance of these shadows, is
Christ; he gave rise unto them, he existed before them, as the body is
before the shadow; not only as God, as the Son of God, but as Mediator,
whom these shadows regarded as such, and as such he cast them; and he is
the end of them, the fulfilling end of them; they have all their
accomplishment in him: and he is the body of spiritual and heavenly
things; the substantial things and doctrines of the Gospel are all of
Christ, they all come by him; all the truths, blessings, and promises of
grace; are from him and by him, and he himself the sum of them all. The
allusion seems to be to a way of speaking among the Jews, who were wont
to call the root, foundation, substance, and essence of a thing, "the
body of it" (n): so they say (o),

"the constitutions concerning the sanctification of the offerings and
the tithes, are, both the one and the other, , "the bodies", or
substantial parts of the law:

and again (p), that "the constitutions or rules about the sabbath, the
festivals and prevarications, they are as mountains that hang by an
hair; for the Scripture is small, and the constitutions are many; the
judgments and the services, the purifications and uncleannesses, and the
incests, they have, upon which they can support themselves, and these,
and these, are , "the bodies of the law":

they say (q) of a small section, or paragraph, that all the bodies of
the law depend upon it: once more (r),

"the sabbaths, and the good days (the feasts or holy days) are "the
bodies" of the sign;

which the phylacteries or frontlets were for; but our apostle says, that
Christ is the body and substance of all these shadows, in opposition to
these sayings and notions of the Jews: some connect this last clause
with the former part of the following verse, rendering it as the Arabic
version thus, "because of the communion of the body of Christ, let no
man condemn you"; and the Ethiopic version thus, "and let no man account
you fools, because of the body of Christ", but there is nothing in the
text to support these versions,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">col 2:18</span></span>

Let no man beguile you of your reward,.... Or prize; the allusion is to
the Olympic games, one of which was running races; in which the stadium,
or race plot was fixed, a mark set up to look and run unto, a
corruptible crown proposed to be run for, and which was held by one who
sat as judge, and determined who got the victory, and to whom the crown
belonged; these judges sometimes acted the unfair part, and defrauded
the victors of their proper right, and to such the apostle compares the
false teachers: the Christian's reward, or prize he is running for, is
the incorruptible and never fading crown of glory, life, and
righteousness; the race plot is the Christian life, spent in the
exercise of grace, and discharge of duty, and in holding fast, and
holding out in a profession of faith unto the end; the mark he looks at,
and presses towards, is Jesus Christ; and his great concern, the apostle
by this metaphor suggests should be, lest by false teachers he should be
defrauded of the prize of the high calling of God, through their
removing the mark Christ from him, by denying his person and Godhead; or
by intercepting his sight of him, placing other objects before him, such
as angels, to be worshipped and adored; or by darkening of it, joining
Moses and Christ, law and Gospel, works and grace together, in the
business of salvation; whereby he might seem to come short, or be in
danger of coming short of the heavenly glory:

in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels; these things the
apostle instances in, as in what lay their danger of being beguiled of
their reward, or prize. True humility is an excellent grace; it is the
clothing and ornament of a Christian; nor is there anything that makes a
man more like Christ, than this grace; but in these men here respected,
it was only the appearance of humility, it was not real; it was in
things they devised and willed, not in things which God commanded,
Christ required, or the Scriptures pointed at; they would have been
thought to have been very lowly and humble, and to have a great
consciousness of their own vileness and unworthiness to draw nigh to
Christ the Mediator immediately, and by him to God; wherefore in
pretence of great humility, they proposed to make use of angels as
mediators with Christ; whereby Christ, the only Mediator between God and
man, would be removed out of sight and use; and that humble boldness and
holy confidence with God at the throne of grace, through Christ, which
believers are allowed to use, would be discouraged and destroyed, and
the saints be in danger as to the outward view of things, and in all
human appearance of losing their reward: "worshipping of angels" was a
practice which very early prevailed among some that were called
Christians, and for a long time continued in Phrygia and Pisidia; some
make Simon Magus, and others Cerinthus, the author of this idolatry; but
was not only a branch of the Platonic philosophy, and so a part of that
philosophy and vain deceit before mentioned, [Col
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#008.md), which these men might have
borrowed from the Gentiles, but was a notion and practice of the Jews:
before the Babylonish captivity, the names of angels were not known, nor
are they ever mentioned by name in Scripture; hence they say (s), that
"the names of angels came up with them, or by their means from Babylon:

after this they began to talk much of them, and to have too high a
veneration for them, and ascribe too much to them; and observing that
the law was ordained, spoken, and given by them, and that the
administration of things under the former dispensation was greatly by
their means, they fell to worshipping of them (t); and the believing
Jews were hereby in great danger of falling into the same practice:
hence the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, writing to the Jewish
church, largely insists on the proof of Christ being superior to angels;
showing that he has a more excellent name than they had; that he was the
Son of God in such sense as they were not the sons of God; that they
were worshippers of him, yea, that they were creatures made by him, and
even ministering spirits to his saints, the heirs of salvation: and very
rightly, is worshipping of angels condemned here by the apostle, since
God only is the object of worship; since these are creatures, and so not
to be adored; are worshippers of God and Christ themselves, and have
refused adoration when it has been offered to them: that the Jews did,
and do worship angels, and make use of them as mediators and
intercessors, is clear from their liturgy, or prayer books, where they
say (u).

", "O ye angels of mercies", or ye merciful angels, ministers of the
most High, entreat now the face of God for good:

and elsewhere (w),

"they say three times, let Juhach keep us, let Juhach deliver us, and
let Juhach help us:

now Juhach was the name of an angel, who they supposed had the care of
men, and is taken from the final letters of those words in [Psa
91:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011.md), "for he shall give his angels
charge over thee": so they speak of an angel whom they call Sandalphon,
who they say is appointed over the prayers of the righteous (x): with
this notion the judaizing and false teachers seem to have been
tinctured, and against which the apostle here cautions the saints, lest,
under a show of humility, they should be drawn into it: and to preserve
them from it, he observes, that such an one who should spread and
propagate such a notion, was one that was

intruding into those things which he hath not seen; thrusting himself in
a bold and daring manner into an inquiry and search after, debate upon,
and affirmation of things he could have no certain knowledge of; as of
angels, whose nature, qualities, works, and ministrations, he had never
seen with his bodily eyes; nor could ever discern with the eyes of his
understanding any such things in the Scriptures, which he ascribed to
them; but they were the birth of his own mind, the fruits of his own
fancy and imagination, things devised in his own brain: being

vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind; judging of things not according to
the word of God, and with a spiritual judgment, and according to a
spiritual sense and experience, but according to his own carnal reason,
and the vanity of his mind; being puffed and swelled with an high
opinion of himself, of his great parts and abilities, of his knowledge
of things above others, and of his capacity to penetrate into, and find
out things which were not seen and known by others: this shows that his
humility was forced, and only in outward appearance, and was not true
and genuine,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">col 2:19</span></span>

And not holding the head,.... Christ, as some copies express it; for by
making use of angels as mediators and intercessors, Christ the only
Mediator, the Lord and head of angels, and of the church, was dropped
and laid aside; which is another reason the apostle gives, why such men,
and their principles and practices, should be shunned and avoided by all
those that had a regard for Christ the head:

from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment
ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God: by
"all the body", or the whole body, is meant the church, the mystical
body of Christ; which, like an human body, consists of various members,
all in union with one another, and with Christ the head: and "by joints
and bands" are intended, either the grace of Christian charity, or love,
the bond of perfectness; which is that in Christ's mystical body, as
joints and bands are in an human body; for by this the members of Christ
are joined, united, and knit together, and make increase: or else the
ordinances of the Gospel, by which the saints are kept together in
order, and through which is spiritual "nourishment ministered", from
Christ the head to them; who hates not his own flesh, the members of his
body, but nourishes and cherishes them, with the wine of divine love,
with the water of life, with himself the bread of life, with his flesh
which is meat indeed, and with his blood which is drink indeed; with his
own wholesome words, even the words of faith and sound doctrine: and it
is from him, that the saints "are knit together": both to one another in
him the cornerstone, and also to him, being made one body and one spirit
with him; and so from and through him, this body "increaseth with the
increase of God": that which God has appointed for his church, and which
he gives; and which it will arrive unto, when all the elect are gathered
in, and they are filled with all the gifts and graces of the Spirit, and
these are brought to their proper pitch and full degree; all which is
had from, and owing to Christ: for if Christ the head is not held, the
body will have no nourishment, but soon become a skeleton; the members
of it will soon loosen from one another and fall into pieces, and there
will be no spiritual increase or edification: all which are so many
reasons, why the saints should be upon their guard against these false
teachers, and judaizing Christians, and which argument and exhortation
the apostle further pursues in the following verses.

[Colossians 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">col 2:20</span></span>

Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ,.... Or "seeing ye are dead with
Christ"; for these words do not signify any doubt about it, but suppose
it, and press what is taken for granted. They were dead with Christ by
virtue of union to him; they being one with him, and considered in him
as their head and representative, died in him, and with him; they were
crucified with him, as they are said to be buried with him, and risen
with him; they were dead with him, by having communion with him in his
death; they partook of the benefits of it, as redemption, pardon,
justification, and reconciliation; and they were planted together with
him in the likeness of his death, not merely partakers of his
sufferings, or suffered with him, and were conformable unto his death,
by undergoing such like things as he did, but as he died unto sin, and
lived unto God, so did they; and through the virtue and efficacy of his
death were dead to sin, so as that it was not imputed to them, so as to
be freed and discharged from it, that it could not damn and destroy
them; yea, so as that itself was crucified with him, and destroyed by
him: and also to the law, to the moral law; not but that they lived
according to it, as in the hands of Christ, in their walk and
conversation, but did not seek for life, righteousness, and salvation by
it; they were dead unto it as to justification by it, and even to
obedience to it in a rigorous and compulsive way; and to all its terrors
and threatenings, being moved to a regard to it from a principle of love
to Christ; and to all its accusations and charges, its curses and
condemnation, and as a ministration of death, fearing neither a
corporeal, nor an eternal one: they were dead also to the ceremonial
law, and were free

from the rudiments, or "elements"

of the world: the ordinances of a worldly sanctuary, the rites and
ceremonies of the world, or state of the Jews, in opposition to, and
distinction from, the Gospel dispensation, or times of the Messiah,
called, and that by them, , "the world to come": these were like letters
to a language, or like the grammar, which contains the rudiments of it;
these were the first principles of the oracles of God, which led to
Christ, and had their accomplishment and end in him; and so believers
were dead unto them, and delivered from them, as they were also to the
world, the Jewish state, and were entered into the world to come; and
even to this present evil world, and to the men and things of it, being
by Christ crucified to it, and that to them: upon all which the apostle
thus reasons,

why, as though living in the world; since ye are dead unto it, and from
the rudiments of it, why should ye be as though ye lived in it? his
meaning is not, that they should not live in the world, nor among the
men of it, for then they must needs go out of the world; saints may live
in the world, though they are not of it, and among the inhabitants of
it, though they do not belong to them, but to another and better
country: nor does he suggest, that they lived according to the course of
the world, as they did in their unregenerate state; but what he seems to
blame them for, and reason with them about, was, that they acted as if
they sought for life and righteousness in the rudiments of the world, or
by their obedience to ceremonial rites, or human inventions: for he
adds,

are ye subject to ordinances? not civil and political ones, which are
for the better and more orderly government of kingdoms, states, and
cities, for these the saints ought to be subject to, both for the Lord's
sake, and conscience sake; nor Gospel ordinances, as baptism, and the
Lord's supper, for such all believers ought to submit unto; but either
legal ones, the weak and beggarly elements, the yoke of bondage, the law
of commandments contained in ordinances, the handwriting of ordinances,
which some were desirous of conforming to; or rather the ordinances and
appointments of the Jewish fathers, the traditions of the elders, their
constitutions and decrees, which are collected together, and make up
their Misna, or oral law; and so the argument is from the one to the
other, from the greater to the less, that if they were delivered by
Christ from the burdensome rites of the ceremonial law, which were
originally appointed by God, it must be great weakness in them to be
subject to the ordinances of men; or both the institutions of the
ceremonial law, and the decrees of the Jewish doctors about them, which
were devised by them, and added to them, and imposed as necessary to be
observed, may be intended; of which the apostle gives some particulars
in [Col 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#021.md).

Touch not, taste not, handle not. This the apostle says, not of himself,
but in the person of the Jewish doctors; who urging the use of the
ceremonial law, to which they added decrees and constitutions of their
own, said, "touch not" the dead body of any man, the bone of a man, or a
grave, any man or woman in their uncleanness; not only their flesh, but
the bed they lay on, or the seat they sat on; or any creature that was
by the law unclean; of a Gentile, or any notorious sinner, or common
man: hence the Pharisees used to wash themselves when they returned from
market, lest they should have been by any means accidentally defiled by
touching any thing unclean. There is a treatise in their Misna, called
Oholot, which gives many rules, and is full of decrees about things ,
"that defile by touching". And so they likewise said, "taste not",
neither the fat, nor the blood of any creature which might be eaten
itself, nor swine's flesh, nor the flesh of any creature that chewed the
cud, or divided the hoof; nor might the Nazarites taste wine, or strong
drink, or vinegar made of either, or moist grapes, or even the kernels
and husks; and if a man ate but the quantity of an olive of any of the
above things, he was, according to the Jewish canons, to be cut off, or
beaten (x): and they also said, "handle not"; or, as the Syriac and
Arabic read, "do not come near", or "draw not nigh", to a Gentile, to
one of another nation, or any unclean person, to whom they forbid any
near approach or conversation; or "handle not" any of the above things.
Some think that these several rules have respect only to meats; as
"touch not", that is, do not eat of things forbidden ever so little;
nay, "taste not", do not let anything of them come within your lips;
yea, "handle not", do not so much as touch them with your fingers.
Others think that touch not regards abstinence from women; see [Co1
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#001.md); and respects the prohibition of
marriage by some in those times; and "taste not", the forbearance of
certain meats, at certain times, which God had not restrained any from;
and "handle not", that is, make no use of, or enjoy your own goods, and
so designs that voluntary poverty which some entered into under the
direction of false teachers,

Which all are to perish with the using,.... Meaning either the
ordinances concerning touching, tasting, and handling, which bring
destruction and death on them that use them, and comply with them, in
order to obtain righteousness and life; for instead of enjoying
salvation through them, they were the cause of damnation to them. Or
rather the meats not to be touched, tasted, or handled; these are in
their own nature perishing things, and perish by being used; they are
only of service to the body, and can be of none to the soul; the using
of them cannot defile the man, nor an abstinence from them sanctify him,
or commend him to God; they only relate to this present life, and will
cease with it, and can have no manner of influence on the spiritual and
eternal concerns of men: and besides, the ordinances concerning them are
not of God, but are

after the commandments and doctrines of men; for so even the ceremonial
law, being now abolished, though originally of God, yet the imposition
of it, as necessary to salvation, was a commandment and doctrine of
man's; and particularly the traditions of the elders, and the various
rules and decrees, which the doctors among the Jews obliged men to
regard, were human inventions and devices: and this is another reason
the apostle makes use of to dissuade from any regard unto them; for
whatever is of man, and not of God, in religious worship, ought to be
rejected.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">col 2:23</span></span>

Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom,.... The authors of them set
up for men of wisdom, and were esteemed such, and are often styled "wise
men"; and their scholars that received their traditions, and explained
and enforced them on others, , "the disciples of the wise men": and they
pretended, that these constitutions of theirs were "a hedge for the
law", and for the honour of it, and to preserve it, and keep men from
transgressing it; and this carried in it some appearance of wisdom: and
their pretensions to it lay in the following things,

in will worship; being what was over and above that which was commanded
by God, and so, like the freewill offerings under the law, must be
acceptable to him; this was one of their colours, which had some show of
wisdom, religion, and zeal:

and humility: in worshipping of angels, and not coming directly, and
with boldness, to God or Christ; or rather in subjecting themselves to
the yoke of the law, and submitting to the decrees of the fathers and
doctors of the church, who were more wise, and learned, and knowing than
they, and so had the appearance of prudence, gentleness, and goodness:

and neglecting of the body; by fastings and watchings, whereby they
seemed to be very religious and devout, holy and mortified persons, who
kept under their bodies, subdued their unruly appetites, and fulfilled
not the lusts of the flesh: but then this was only a show of wisdom and
godliness; there was no truth nor reality in these things; they were
only a mere form, an outside show, a mere pretence; there was no true
devotion nor religion in them: and so

not in any honour; or to be had in any esteem; for if the rites of the
ceremonial law itself were weak and beggarly elements, much more must
these additions to it, and corruptions of it, be such; and at most only
regarded things external, that were

to the satisfying, of the flesh; either the body, or the carnal mind, in
which they were vainly pulled up: though some consider this last clause
as explanative of the former, "neglecting of the body", or not sparing
it, but afflicting it with austerities of life; depriving it of its
proper right, what is necessary for it, not taking due care of it, so as
to satisfy nature; whereby instead of honouring, they dishonoured it:
for though the body is not to be pampered, and the lusts of it indulged,
or luxury and intemperance to be encouraged; yet since the body is the
work of God's hands, is the habitation of the soul, and by which it
performs its offices, and is the purchase of Christ, the temple of the
Holy Spirit, and will be raised a glorious body at the last day, it
ought not to be neglected and dishonoured; but should have a sufficiency
of food and clothing, whereby it may be comfortably and honourably
nourished and supported.
