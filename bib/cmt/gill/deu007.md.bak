INTRODUCTION TO DEUTERONOMY 7

In this chapter the Israelites are exhorted to destroy the seven nations
of the land of Canaan, when they entered into it, and to make no
alliances with them of any kind, nor suffer any remains of idolatry to
continue, [Deu 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001.md) to observe which,
and other commands of God, they are urged from the consideration of
their being freely chosen of God above all other people, and of their
being redeemed out of the house of bondage, and of the Lord's being a
covenant keeping God to them, [Deu 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#006.md)
and it is promised them, for their further encouragement to keep the
commands of God, that they should have an increase of all temporal good
things, and no evils and calamities should come upon them, [Deu
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#012.md), and, lest they should be
disheartened at the numbers and might of their enemies, they are put in
mind of what God had done for them in Egypt, and of what he had promised
to do for them now, [Deu 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#017.md) and they
are assured that the nations should be cast out before them by little
and little, until they were utterly destroyed, [Deu
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#021.md) and the chapter is concluded with
an exhortation to destroy their images, and not admit anything of that
sort to be brought into their houses, [Deu
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#025.md).

[Deuteronomy 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 7:1</span></span>

When the Lord thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest
to possess it,.... The land of Canaan they were just now going into to
take possession of; their introduction into which is here, as in many
other places, ascribed not to themselves, or their leaders, but to the
Lord as their covenant God:

and hath cast out many nations before thee; even all that were in it,
the seven following:

the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites,
and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites; the Canaanites
were a particular nation in the land of Canaan, which had their name
from Canaan himself; the rest were called from different sons of his;
see [Gen 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#015.md), the country of the
Gergesenes, the same with the Girgashites, continued its name unto the
times of Christ, [Mat 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#028.md),

seven nations greater and mightier than thou; more in number, and more
robust in body, some being of a gigantic stature; there were ten of
these nations in Abraham's time, three of them were since sunk or
swallowed up among the rest, the Kenites, and Kenizires, and the
Rephaim; for instead of the Kadmonites the Hivites are here put, which
seem to be the same.

[Deuteronomy 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 7:2</span></span>

And when the Lord thy God shall deliver them before thee,.... Into their
hands:

thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them; men, women, and
children; which was ordered not merely to make way and room for the
people of Israel to inherit their land, but as a punishment for capital
crimes they had been guilty of, such as idolatry, incest, murder, &c.
wherefore though they were reprieved for a while for Israel's sake, till
their time was come to possess the land, they were at length righteously
punished; which observed, abates the seeming severity exercised upon
them:

thou shalt make no covenant with them; to dwell in their cities and
houses, and enjoy their lands and estates, on any condition whatever;
and though they did make a league with the Gibeonites, that was obtained
by fraud, they pretending not to be of the land of Canaan, but to come
from a very distant country:

nor show mercy unto them; by sparing their lives, bestowing any favours
upon them, or giving them any help and assistance when in distress: the
Jews extend this to all other Heathen nations besides these seven;
wherefore, if an Israelite, as Maimonides (z) says, should see a Gentile
perishing, or plunged into a river, he may not take him out, nor
administer medicine to a sick person. Hence Juvenal (a) the poet
upbraids them with their unkindness and incivility; and says that Moses
delivered it as a Jewish law, in a secret volume of his, perhaps
referring to this book of Deuteronomy, that the Jews might not direct a
poor traveller in his way unless he was one of their religion, nor one
athirst to a fountain of water; and which led Tacitus (b), the Heathen
historian, to make this remark upon them, that they entertained an
hostile hatred against all other people.

\(z\) Hilchot Abodath Cochabim, c. 10. sect. 1, 2. (a) "Non monstrare
vias", &c. Satyr 14. (b) Hist l. 5. c. 5.

[Deuteronomy 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 7:3</span></span>

Neither shalt thou make marriages with them,.... Unless they became
proselytes, as Rahab, who was married by Salmon, and so those of other
nations, as Ruth the Moabitess, and so any captive taken in war;
otherwise it was not lawful, bad consequences have followed upon it,
which it is the design of this law to prevent; that is, being snared and
drawn aside into idolatry, which was the case of Solomon:

thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt
thou take unto thy son; for, according to the Targum of Jonathan,
whosoever marries with them, it is as if he married with their idols:
and this law, according to the Jewish writers (c), is binding with
respect to other nations besides the seven; and whosoever marries any
Heathen, of whatsoever nation, is to be beaten.

\(c\) Maimon. Hilchot lssure Biah, c. 12. sect. 1.

[Deuteronomy 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 7:4</span></span>

For they will turn away thy son from following me,.... From the pure
worship of God, his word, statutes, and ordinances:

that they may serve other gods; worship their idols; that is, the
daughters of Heathens, married to the sons of Israelites, would entice
them from the worship of the true God to idolatry; so the Targum of
Jonathan; as Solomon's wives drew him aside: or "he will turn away thy
son" (d); meaning, as Jarchi observes, that the son of an Heathen, that
marries the daughter of an Israelite, will turn away the son born of her
to idolatry, called here the grandfather's son; though Aben Ezra says
this respects the son mentioned in the preceding verse, that is, the son
married to an Heathen woman, and not to a son born in such marriage:

so will the anger of the Lord be kindled against you, and destroy thee
suddenly; by some immediate judgment striking dead at once; there being
nothing more provoking to God than idolatry, that being directly
contrary to his being, nature, perfections, honour, and glory, of which
he is jealous.

[Deuteronomy 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 7:5</span></span>

But thus shall ye deal with them,.... The inhabitants of the land of
Canaan:

ye shall destroy their altars; on which they sacrificed to their idols:

and break down their images; of their gods, and the statues and pillars
erected to the honour of them:

and cut down their groves; sacred to idols, which were usually planted
on hills, and about Heathen temples, and under which idols were placed
to be worshipped. The Targum of Jonathan calls them trees of their
adoration, under which they worshipped; though there was a worship paid
to them, not indeed directly to them, or for their sakes, but for the
sake of the idols they were sacred to, or were placed under them; so
Maimonides (e) says, a tree which at first was planted to be worshipped
is forbidden of any use (or profit); and this is the or "grove", spoken
of in the law, a tree planted and lopped, of which a graven image is
made for an idol; and so the tree that has been worshipped, though the
body of it is, not forbidden, all the shoots and leaves, and the
branches, and the fruits it produces all the time it is worshipped, are
forbidden to be used: though the word here used sometimes seems to
signify, not a grove of trees, but some image itself, since we read of
it in the temple, [Kg2 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#007.md),

and burn their graven images with fire; distinguished from their molten
images, which may be meant in a preceding clause, and which are
particularly mentioned as to be destroyed as well as these, [Num
33:52](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#052.md).

\(e\) Hilchot Obede Cochabim, c. 8. sect. 3, 4. Vid. Misn. Avodah Zarah,
c. 3. sect. 7.

[Deuteronomy 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 7:6</span></span>

For thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God,.... Not sanctified in
a spiritual sense, or having principles of grace and holiness in them,
from whence holy actions sprang, at least not all of them; but they were
separated from all other people in the world to the pure worship and
service of God in an external manner, and therefore were to avoid all
idolatry, and every appearance of it:

the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself
above all people that are upon the face of the earth; for special
service and worship, and to enjoy special privileges and benefits, civil
and religious; though they were not chosen to special grace here, and
eternal glory hereafter; at least not all of them, only a remnant,
according to the election of grace; yet they were typical of the chosen
people of God in a special sense; who are chosen out of the world to be
a peculiar people, to be holy here and happy hereafter; to enjoy
communion with God in this life and that to come, as well as to serve
and glorify him now and for evermore.

[Deuteronomy 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 7:7</span></span>

The Lord did not set his love upon you, nor choose you,.... He had done
both, and the one as the effect and evidence of the other; he loved
them, and therefore he chose them; but neither of them:

because ye were more in number than any people; not for the quantity of
them, nor even for the quality of them:

for ye were the fewest of all people; fewer than the Egyptians, from
whence they came, and than the Canaanites they were going to drive out
and inherit their land, [Deu 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001.md).
Those whom God has loved with an everlasting love, and as a fruit of it
has chosen them in Christ before the world began to grace and glory,
holiness and happiness, are but a small number, a little flock; though
many are called, few are chosen; nor are they better than others, being
by nature children of wrath even as others, and as to their outward
circumstances the poor of this world.

[Deuteronomy 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 7:8</span></span>

But because the Lord loved you,.... With an unmerited love; he loved
them, because he loved them; that is, because he would love them; his
love was not owing to any goodness in them, or done by them, or any love
in them to him, but to his own good will and pleasure:

and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers;
the promise he had made, confirmed by an oath:

hath the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand; out of the land of
Egypt:

and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen; where they were bondmen to
the Egyptians:

from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt; who detained them, and refused
to let them go.

[Deuteronomy 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 7:9</span></span>

The only true and living God, and not the idols of the Gentiles, who are
false and lifeless ones, and therefore not the proper objects of
adoration:

the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy; as appeared by
fulfilling the promise made to their fathers, in bringing them out of
Egypt, and now them to the borders of the land of Canaan given them for
an inheritance:

with them that love him, and keep his commandments, to a thousand
generations; see [Exo 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#006.md) which are
not the causes or conditions of his covenant and mercy, nor of his
keeping them, but descriptive of the persons that enjoy the benefit
thereof.

[Deuteronomy 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 7:10</span></span>

And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them,....
Openly, publicly, and at once, they not being able to make any
resistance. Onkelos interprets it in their lifetime, and so Jarchi which
agrees with the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem: "or to his face"; (f)
the face of God; that is, he will punish them that hate him to his face,
who are audacious, bold, impudent sinners; sinners before the Lord, as
the men of Sodom were, [Gen 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#013.md),

he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his
face; not defer the execution of his judgment and vengeance, which may
seem to slumber and linger, but will quickly and openly bring it upon
the sinner; this also the Chaldee paraphrases explain as before.

[Deuteronomy 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 7:11</span></span>

Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the
judgments,.... The laws, moral, ceremonial, and judicial, urged
thereunto both by promises and threatenings, in hopes of reward, and
through fear of punishment:

which I command thee this day, to do them; in the name of the Lord, and
by his authority; by virtue of which he made a new declaration of them
to put them in mind of them in order to observe them.

[Deuteronomy 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 7:12</span></span>

Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments, and
keep and do them,.... Attentively listen to the declaration made of
them, and be careful to observe them:

that the Lord thy God shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy
which he sware unto thy fathers; to bring them into the land of Canaan,
and continue them in it; yea, to send the Messiah to them, and bring him
the salvation of Israel out of Zion; see [Luk
1:68](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#068.md).

[Deuteronomy 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 7:13</span></span>

And he will love thee,.... As he has done, and rest in his love, and
give further instances and proofs of it:

and bless thee, and multiply thee; that is bless thee with a
multiplication of offspring, which was what was often promised to
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; that their seed should be as the stars of
heaven, the dust of the earth, and the sand of the sea:

he will also bless the fruit of thy womb; not only give strength to
conceive, but carry on the pregnancy, preserve the foetus, and prevent
miscarrying:

and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil; which
were the principal produce of it:

the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep: their larger and
lesser cattle, oxen and sheep: in the land which he sware unto thy
fathers to give thee; the land of Canaan, given in promise, and that
established by an oath.

[Deuteronomy 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 7:14</span></span>

Thou shalt be blessed above all people,.... Even with temporal
blessings, besides those of a religious kind; they having the oracles of
God, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service of God, and the
promises, [Rom 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#001.md),

there shall not be male or female barren among you; which to be was
reckoned a reproach, and the contrary a blessing, [Luk
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#025.md) [Psa
128:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#003.md).

or among your cattle; the Targum of Jonathan is, nor thy beasts barren
of wool, and milk, and lambs.

[Deuteronomy 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 7:15</span></span>

And will take away from thee all sickness,.... Bodily sickness and
diseases, prevent the coming of them, or remove them when come:

and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt which thou knowest upon
thee; meaning either the plagues that were inflicted upon them to oblige
them to let the Israelites go, of which they had perfect knowledge; or
else some noxious and nauseous diseases, which were common among, and
peculiar to, the Egyptians, particularly what is called the botch of
Egypt; see [Exo 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#026.md), likewise the
leprosy; See Gill on [Lev 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#002.md); see
Gill on [Deu 28:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#027.md).

but will lay them upon all them that hate thee; with which God sometimes
punishes his and his people's enemies; see [Jdg
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#009.md).

[Deuteronomy 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 7:16</span></span>

And thou shall consume all the people which the Lord thy God shall
deliver thee,.... All the inhabitants of the land of Canaan, which the
Lord should deliver into their hands; them they were not to spare, but
utterly destroy men, women, and children:

thine eye shall have no pity upon them; See Gill on [Deu
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#002.md),

neither shall thou serve their gods, for that will be a snare unto thee;
which will bring into utter ruin and destruction; see [Exo
23:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#033.md).

[Deuteronomy 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 7:17</span></span>

If thou shall say in thine heart,.... Should have secret thoughts arise
in the heart, misgivings of heart, fears and doubts there, which, though
not outwardly expressed, might be inwardly retained:

these nations are more than I; seven to one, and perhaps anyone of them
as powerful as Israel:

how can I dispossess them? of the land they inherit, and take possession
of it.

[Deuteronomy 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 7:18</span></span>

Thou shalt not be afraid of them,.... Neither on account of their
number, nor their strength:

but shall well remember what the Lord thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto
all Egypt; a people more numerous and potent than the Canaanites, among
whom the Lord wrought such wonderful things by his power, which obliged
them to let Israel go; and his power was now the same, he could do as
great things to the Canaanites as he had to the Egyptians; and as he had
delivered them out of the hands of the Egyptians, he could as easily
deliver the Canaanites into their hands, and put them into the
possession of their country.

[Deuteronomy 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 7:19</span></span>

The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the
wonders,.... The miracles wrought in Egypt; see [Deu
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#034.md).

and the mighty hand, and stretched out arm, whereby the Lord thy God
brought thee out; that is, out of Egypt, which was an instance and proof
of his almighty power:

so shall the Lord thy God do unto all the people of whom thou art
afraid; not perform the same miraculous operations among them, but exert
the same power in the destruction of them, and in dispossessing them of
their land, as in destroying the Egyptians, and delivering Israel from
among them.

[Deuteronomy 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">deu 7:20</span></span>

Moreover, the Lord thy God will send the hornet among them,.... Not a
single one, but several of them, and which may be understood of
creatures so called, which resemble wasps, only twice as large, an
insect very bold and venomous; see [Exo
23:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#028.md). Aben Ezra interprets it of the
leprosy:

until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed;
such of the Canaanites who escaped the sword of the Israelites, and hid
themselves in holes and caverns of the earth; these the hornets would
find out and sting them to death, until they were all destroyed. Thus
God can make use of small creatures, even insects, to destroy nations
the most populous and mighty.

[Deuteronomy 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">deu 7:21</span></span>

Thou shall not be affrighted at them,.... At their numbers, nor at their
gigantic stature:

for the Lord thy God is among you: in the tabernacle, in the holy of
holies, which was in the midst of them, and besides would give proof of
his powerful presence among them, in protecting them, and destroying
their enemies:

a mighty God and terrible; mighty to save his people, and terrible to
others.

[Deuteronomy 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">deu 7:22</span></span>

And the Lord thy God will put out those nations before thee by little
and little,.... Which is observed for their encouragement, who seeing
that all were not destroyed at once, might fear the work would never be
thoroughly accomplished; see [Exo
23:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#030.md),

thou mayest not consume them at once; though it was in the power of
their hands to do it, there being some wise reasons for sparing them
awhile, at least for not cutting them off all at once, and one follows:

lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee; through so many places
being waste without inhabitants, and there being none to destroy these
creatures; and who therefore in course would become more numerous, and
so more troublesome and distressing to the Israelites. The Targum of
Jonathan adds, by way of explanation,"when they shall come to devour
their carcasses,''the carcasses of the slain Canaanites; who, if
destroyed at once, would be so many, that they would lie unburied, which
would invite the beasts of the field to come out of their lurking places
to feed upon them, and which might lead them on to mischief among the
Israelites.

[Deuteronomy 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">deu 7:23</span></span>

But the Lord thy God shall deliver them unto thee,.... Gradually, by
little and little, until at length they should all come into their
hands: and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction until they be
destroyed; even all of them.

[Deuteronomy 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">deu 7:24</span></span>

And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand,.... Who were very
numerous, for though there were but seven nations, there were more
kings, even one and thirty, [Jos 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#009.md),

thou shall destroy their name from under heaven; not only destroy the
name of the reigning kings, so as that they should not be remembered and
made mention of any more, but put an end to the name and race of kings
among them, so that they should never have any more, as they never had:

there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have
destroyed them; the nations and their kings.

[Deuteronomy 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">deu 7:25</span></span>

The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire,.... Which is
repeated from [Deu 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#005.md), that it might
be the more observed and strictly performed, and which unless done, they
could not expect the utter destruction of their enemies, who were left
in the land to try and prove them with respect to this very thing:

thou shall not desire the silver or gold that is on them: the raiment of
gold or silver with which they were bedecked, or the plates of gold and
silver with which they were covered, or any ornament about them, as
chains and the like, that were of either of these metals; see [Eze
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#016.md),

nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein; nor take it into
their possession, or bring it into their houses, as in the next verse,
lest they should be under a temptation to worship it, or keep it as a
superstitious relic:

for it is an abomination to the Lord thy God; not only the idol itself,
being put in the place of God, and so derogatory to his honour and
glory, but the gold and silver on it, being devoted to a superstitious
and idolatrous use; and even the taking of it, and appropriating it to a
man's own use, was an abomination, and resented by the Lord as such.

[Deuteronomy 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">deu 7:26</span></span>

Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thy house,.... An idol, so
the Targum of Jonathan, the abominations of idols and their utensils, or
what is ministered to them, with anything that appertains to them, or is
used in the service of them, as well as the gold and silver upon them;
this care was taken as much as possible to prevent idolatry, and all
appearance of it, and to show what might lead on and be a temptation to
it:

lest thou be a cursed thing like it; as an idol is, and so is everyone
that worships it; for what more exposes to the curse of God than
idolatry, a breach of the first table of the law? and therefore subjects
a man to the curse of it; nay, the bringing of an idol into a man's
house brings a curse into it, and makes him liable thereunto; for if the
curse enters into the house of the thief or perjurer, much more into the
house of a man guilty of idolatry in any degree of it; see [Zac
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#003.md) but thou shalt utterly detest it;
the Targum of Jonathan adds, as the pollution of an abominable thing:

and thou shalt utterly abhor it, for it is a cursed thing; devoted to
destruction; and to have anything to do with it is the way to entail a
curse, and bring to everlasting ruin and destruction; see [Rev
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#008.md).
