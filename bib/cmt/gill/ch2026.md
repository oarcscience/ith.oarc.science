### [2 Chronicles Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 26:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO 2 CHRONICLES 26

This chapter relates the good reign of Uzziah, [Ch2
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#001), his wars and victories, his
buildings, the number of his soldiers, and his military stores, [Ch2
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#006), his invasion of the priest's
office, in attempting to offer incense, for which he was smitten with a
leprosy, which continued to his death, [Ch2
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#016).

[2 Chronicles 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 26:1</span></span>

Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah,.... Of this and the three
following verses, see the notes on [Kg2
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#021) where Uzziah is called Azariah.
See Gill on [Kg2 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#021), [Kg2
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#022), [Kg2
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#002), [Kg2
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#003)

[2 Chronicles 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 26:5</span></span>

And he sought God in the days of Zechariah,.... Not that Zechariah, the
last of the prophets save one, he lived three hundred years after this;
nor he that Joash slew; but, as it may seem, a son of his, perhaps the
same with him in [Isa 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#002),

who had understanding in the visions of God: who either had prophetic
visions granted to him, or had divine wisdom to interpret such that
others had; or, as others think, had a gift of interpreting the
prophecies of others, the writings of Moses and David, &c. to which the
Targum seems to agree; which paraphrases it,"who taught in the fear of
the Lord;''with which agree the Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic versions;
some copies read "in the fear of God"; as an ancient manuscript
mentioned by Junius, and so the Talmud (l):

and, as long as he sought the Lord, God made him to prosper; in his
kingdom, and against his enemies; even so long as he abode by the word,
worship, and ordinances of God, of which instances are given, as follow.

[2 Chronicles 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 26:6</span></span>

And he went forth, and warred against the Philistines,.... Who in the
times of Jehoram broke in upon Judah, and distressed them, [Ch2
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#016).

and brake down the wall of Gath; which was one of the five
principalities of the Philistines:

and the wall of Jabneh; nowhere else mentioned in Scripture, but
frequent in the Jewish writings; where the sanhedrim sometimes sat, and
where was a famous university, and from whence sprung many of the Jewish
rabbins; it is the same which in some writers is called Jamnia, and was
a port near to Joppa; and belonged to the tribe of Dan, as Josephus (m)
writes:

and the wall of Ashdod: another of the principalities of the
Philistines, the same with the Azotus of the New Testament; he
dismantled all these places:

and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines; where he
placed garrisons to keep them in awe; see [Amo
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#008).

[2 Chronicles 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 26:7</span></span>

And God helped him against the Philistines,.... He did not do all before
related of himself, and by his own strength, but by the help of God; the
Targum is"the Word of the Lord helped him:"

and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gurbaal; the same with Gerar,
according to the Targum; which also belonged to the Philistines, and had
a king in Abraham's time, [Gen 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#001),
the same with Askelon, another of the five principalities of the
Philistines:

and the Mehunims; or the Minaeans, as the Septuagint, and whom Pliny (n)
makes mention of among the Arabians; they seem to be the Scenite Arabs;
see [Ch2 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#001), or rather, as the
Targum, those that dwelt in the plain of Maon, which was in Arabia
Petraea.

[2 Chronicles 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 26:8</span></span>

And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah,.... As tributaries to him, or;
however, as desirous to live in friendship with him:

and his name spread abroad, even to the entering in of Egypt; so far he
carried his arms, and conquered the countries that lay between Palestine
and Egypt:

for he strengthened himself exceedingly; his kingdom and its coasts from
the force of enemies.

[2 Chronicles 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 26:9</span></span>

Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate,.... Which
was broken down by the king of Israel in his father's time, [Ch2
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#023) and which he not only repaired,
but strengthened, by building a tower upon it:

and at the valley gate; which led to the valley, [Neh
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#013), called the valley of the dead
bodies, in which they were cast, and in which the brook Kidron ran, [Jer
31:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#040).

and at the turning of the wall; at each of those places he built towers,
which Josephus (o) says were one hundred and fifty cubits high: and
fortified them; put garrisons of soldiers into them.

\(o\) Antiqu. l. 9. c. 10. sect. 3.

[2 Chronicles 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 26:10</span></span>

Also he built towers in the desert,.... In the desert of Arabia, to
protect travellers from thieves and robbers, and particularly shepherds
and their flocks, as appears by what follows; which a certain writer (p)
thinks are the same which the Indians call pagodas; not such as served
for temples, but were buildings encompassed with good walls, where
flocks were gathered together in case of any alarm:

and digged many wells; for the watering of the flocks, which in those
hot and desert places were of great use:

for he had much cattle, both in the low country and in the plains; both
flocks and herds:

husbandmen also, and vinedressers in the mountains; husbandmen to take
care of the corn, and manure the land for that, and gather it when ripe;
and vinedressers to prune the vines, and look after them; which were
very often planted on mountains, and on which also corn grew, [Psa
72:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#016).

and in Carmel; a place in the tribe of Judah, where Nabal dwelt, [Sa1
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#002) or it may be put for any fruitful
field:

for he loved husbandry; not only the profit, but the exercise of it at
times; and it was usual with great personages in the eastern countries
to employ themselves in some such way; Saul after he was king attended
the herd, [Sa1 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#005), Mesha king of
Moab was a sheep master, [Kg2 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#004),
among the Romans, Quinctius Cincinnatus and Cato Major (q) were great
lovers of husbandry; and we read of one of the Chinese emperors that
gave himself to husbandry, held the plough himself, broke the clods, and
cast in the seed, to set an example to the whole empire (r). Another of
their emperors gave himself wholly to husbandry (s); an other chose an
husbandman for his successor, and who also encouraged husbandry (t).

[2 Chronicles 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 26:11</span></span>

Moreover, Uzziah had an host of fighting men,.... A standing army:

that went out to war by bands; to annoy his enemies, and to scour the
country from thieves and robbers, that came in troops to plunder:

according to the number of their account, by the hand of Jeiel the
scribe; the secretary of war, who ordered these bands, settled their
number, and directed their destination:

and Maaseiah the ruler; or officer over them, a lieutenant:

under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king's captains; that had the
command of them, or at least of one of them.

[2 Chronicles 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 26:12</span></span>

The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour
were two thousand six hundred. Who were the commanders and principal
officers of his army; and such a number supposed a large army, as
follows.

[2 Chronicles 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 26:13</span></span>

And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven
thousand and five hundred,.... Which was larger than that in his
father's time by 7500, [Ch2 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#005)
besides officers:

that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy;
they were ready to fight, and fight valiantly, whenever the king had any
occasion for them, or the land was invaded.

[2 Chronicles 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 26:14</span></span>

And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host,.... For every
soldier in the army:

shields and spears; defensive and offensive weapons, the one to cover
and protect their bodies, the other to push and pierce their enemies:

and helmets, and habergeons; the first of these were a covering for the
head in the day of battle, and the other coats of mail, to defend the
body:

and bows; to shoot arrows out of:

and slings to cast stones; at which the Benjaminites formerly were very
expert.

[2 Chronicles 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 26:15</span></span>

And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the
towers, and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones
withal,.... Such as with the Romans were called "catapultae",
"ballistae" (u), "scorpiones" (w), &c. and by this it appears that these
were not first invented in Greece and Rome, but in Judea. It is said
(x), that the Romans received the machine to batter cities from the
Greeks, and that the Trojan horse was no other than a battering ram; but
if they did, the invention of them must be ascribed, not to them, but
rather to the Syrians and Phoenicians, according to Pliny (y); though
others (z) suppose the Carthaginians, who were a colony of theirs, to be
the inventors of them; yet, after all, they seem to be the device of
some skilful men among the Jews, in the times of Uzziah; according to
Diodorus Siculus (a), they were not found out when Nineveh was besieged
in the times of Sardanapalus:

and his name spread far abroad; in distant countries, for his warlike
dispositions and preparations, which made them stand in fear of him:

for he was helped until he was strong; he was wonderfully helped by the
Lord to build fortified places, raise a numerous army, and provide all
sorts of armour for them, and invent such machines as would greatly
annoy the enemy, whereby he became very potent, and injected dread round
about him.

[2 Chronicles 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 26:16</span></span>

When he was strong,.... Became great and powerful, through his
victories, the enlargement of his dominions, and having a numerous army,
and these well accoutred, and many fortified cities and towers:

his heart was lifted up to his destruction; he grew vain and proud,
elated with his flourishing circumstances, which issued in his ruin:

for he transgressed against the Lord his God; who had helped him, and
made him so great, and had bestowed so many favours upon him; the Targum
is,"the Word of the Lord his God;''what his transgression was, follows:

and went into the temple of the Lord; the holy place, into which none
but the priests might enter:

to burn incense upon the altar of incense; which stood there.

[2 Chronicles 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 26:17</span></span>

And Azariah the priest went in after him,.... To hinder him from doing
it, and to persuade him to go out. This was the high priest, as appears
from [Ch2 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#020) and is thought to be
the same that is spoken of in [Ch1
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#010).

and with him eighty priests of the Lord, that were valiant men; not only
able bodied men, but men of spirit and courage, and zealous for the
honour of God.

[2 Chronicles 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 26:18</span></span>

And they withstood Uzziah the king,.... They not only stood against him,
but stood about him, surrounded him, so as to hinder him from
approaching the altar of incense:

and said unto him, it appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn
incense unto the Lord; it did not belong to his office as a king, it was
no part of it

but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn
incense; and to them only; for even the Levites might not do it, only
those of the tribe of Levi, that descended from Aaron, see [Num
16:35](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#035),

go out of the sanctuary, for thou hast trespassed; by going into that:

neither shall it be for thine honour from the Lord God; but to his hurt,
and be a brand of infamy upon him; for more is designed than is
expressed, and as the event showed.

[2 Chronicles 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch2 26:19</span></span>

Then Uzziah was wroth,.... With the priests, and, as Josephus (b) says,
threatened to kill them:

and had a censer in his hand to burn incense; ready to do it, and
resolved upon it:

and while he was wroth with the priests; and expressing his indignation,
and do what he would do to them, if they continued to oppose him:

the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house
of the Lord, from beside the incense altar; which seems not only to
describe the position of the priests, being beside the altar of incense,
to keep the king from it, when the leprosy was seen by them in his
forehead, but the quarter from whence the stroke invisibly came.
Josephus (c) says, there was earthquake at the same time, and a mountain
was rent.

\(b\) Antiqu. l. 9. c. 10. sect. 4. (c) lbid.

[2 Chronicles 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 26:20</span></span>

And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and,
behold, he was leprous in his forehead,.... He was leprous all over his
body, no doubt, but it appeared in his forehead very remarkably, and was
seen by them all, who, without doubt, informed him of his case, and of
which he soon became sensible:

and they thrust him out from thence; the holy place, he being now unfit
to be in a common dwelling house, or his own palace, and much less to be
in the house of God:

yea, himself also hasted to go out, because the Lord had smitten him;
fearing, should he continue there, that something worse would befall
him; the Targum is, the Word of the Lord. The leprosy was a disease sent
immediately from God, as the case of Miriam, and this of Uzziah, show;
and so the Persians (d) had a notion, that those had it who sinned
against the sun, and for that reason, and which they accounted and
worshipped as God.

[2 Chronicles 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 26:21</span></span>

And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in
a several house, being a leper,.... See Gill on [Kg2
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#005),

for he was cut off from the house of the Lord; not, suffered to enter
into that, because of his uncleanness:

and Jotham his son was over the king's house, judging the people of the
land; see [Kg2 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#005).

[2 Chronicles 26:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch2 26:22</span></span>

Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last,.... What were done
by him, both in the beginning and latter end of his reign:

did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write: not in his own prophecy,
but in the history of his own times, which was usual for every prophet
to write, though now lost, see [Kg2
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#006).

[2 Chronicles 26:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch2 26:23</span></span>

So Uzziah slept with his fathers,.... Died as they did, the same year,
according to Dr. Lightfoot (e), in which he was smitten with the
leprosy; and in the year of his death it was Isaiah had the vision
related in [Isa 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001), &c.

and they buried him with his fathers; See Gill on [Kg2
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#007).
