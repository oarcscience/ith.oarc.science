INTRODUCTION TO LAMENTATIONS

This book very properly follows the prophecy of Jeremiah, not only
because wrote by him, but because of the subject matter of it, the
deplorable case of the Jews upon the destruction of their city; and has
been reckoned indeed as making one book with it; so Dean Prideaux (a)
supposes it was reckoned by Josephus (b), according to the number of the
books of the Old Testament, which he gives; but it does not stand in
this order in all printed Hebrew Bibles, especially in those published
by the Jews; where it is placed in the Hagiographa, and among the five
Megilloth; or with the books of Ruth, Esther, Ecclesiastes, and
Solomon's Song, read at their festivals, as this on their public fast,
on the ninth of Ab, for the destruction of their city; because they
fancy it was not written by the gift of prophecy, but by the Holy Ghost,
between which they make a distinction; and therefore remove it from the
prophets; but this is the most natural place for it. It is sometimes
called by the Jews "Echa", from the first word of it, which signifies
"how"; and sometimes "Kinoth", "Lamentations", from the subject of it;
and so by the Septuagint version "Threni", which signifies the same; and
which is followed by the Vulgate Latin, and others, and by us. That
Jeremiah was the writer of it is not questioned; nor is the divine
authority of it doubted of. The precise place and time where and when he
wrote it is not certain: some say he wrote it in a cave or den near
Jerusalem; and Adrichomius (c) makes mention of a place, called

"the Prophet Jeremiah's pit, where he sat in the bitterness of his soul,
grieving and weeping; and lamented and described the destruction of
Jerusalem made by the Chaldeans, in a fourfold alphabet in metre; where
Helena the empress, according to Nicephorus, built some wonderful
works;''

but it rather seems that he wrote these Lamentations after he was
carried away with the rest of the captives to Ramah, and dismissed to
Mizpah, at one or other of these places. It is written in Hebrew metre,
though now little understood; and the first four chapters in an
alphabetical manner; every verse beginning in order with the letters of
the alphabet; and in the third chapter it is done three times over;
three verses together beginning with the same letter: this seems to be
done to make it more agreeable, and to help the memory. Jarchi thinks
that this is the same book, which, having been publicly read by Baruch,
was cut to pieces by King Jehoiakim, and cast into the fire (d) and
burnt; which consisted of the first, second, and fourth chapters, and to
which was afterwards added the third chapter; but it is without any
reason or foundation; seeing that contained all Jeremiah's prophecies,
not only against Israel and Judah, but against all the nations, [Jer
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#002.md); which this book has nothing of;
nor even the words, which are particularly said to be in that,
respecting the destruction of Jerusalem by the king of Babylon, [Jer
32:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#029); Josephus (e.md) seems to have been
of opinion that this book of Lamentations was written by Jeremy on
account of the death of Josiah, [Ch2
35:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#025.md); and in which he is followed by
many; but the lamentation made in this book is not for a single person
only, but for a city, and even for the whole nation of the Jews; nor is
there anything suitable to Josiah, and his case; what seems most
plausible is in [Lam 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#020.md); and that
better agrees with Zedekiah than with him. It appears plainly to be
written after the destruction of the city and temple, and the sad
desolation made in the land of Judea, because of the sins of the priests
and people; and the design of it is to lament these things; to bring
them to repentance and humiliation for their sins, and to give some
comfortable hope that God will be merciful to them, and restore them
again to their former privileges, for which the prophet prays. The
introduction to it, in the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, and Arabic
versions, is,

"and it came to pass after Israel was carried captive, and Jerusalem
laid waste, Jeremiah sat weeping, and delivered out this lamentation
over Jerusalem; and said,''
