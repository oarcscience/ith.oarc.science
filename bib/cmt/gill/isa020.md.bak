### [Isaiah Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

INTRODUCTION TO ISAIAH 20

This chapter contains a prophecy of the destruction of the Egyptians and
Ethiopians by the Assyrians, which had been prophesied of separately in
the two preceding chapters [Isa 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#001.md),
and now conjunctly in this: the time of it is given, [Isa
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001.md) the sign of it, the prophet's
walking naked, and barefoot, [Isa 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#002.md)
the explanation and accommodation of the sign to the captivity of Egypt
and Ethiopia, [Isa 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#003.md) the use of
this to the Jews, and the effect it had upon them; shame for their trust
and dependence on the above nations, and despair of deliverance from the
Assyrians by their means, [Isa 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#005.md).

[Isaiah 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 20:1</span></span>

In the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod,.... Or Azotus, as the
Septuagint here call it; and which is its name in the New Testament; see
Gill on [Act 8:40](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#040.md). This Tartan, or
whom the Septuagint names Tanathan, and the Arabic version Tathan, was
one of Sennacherib's generals, [Kg2
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#017.md),

(when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him); to the above place to
besiege it. This Sargon is generally thought to be the same with
Sennacherib, since Tartan was one of his generals, who might have more
names than one. Jerom says he had seven; the Jewish Rabbins (h) eight;
though some think a predecessor of his is meant, Shalmaneser; and others
his son Esarhaddon, who in the Apocrypha:

"And there passed not five and fifty days, before two of his sons killed
him, and they fled into the mountains of Ararath; and Sarchedonus his
son reigned in his stead; who appointed over his father's accounts, and
over all his affairs, Achiacharus my brother Anael's son.'' (Tobit 1:21)

is called Sarchedon, which might easily pass by pronunciation into
Sargon:

and fought against Ashdod, and took it; which was held by the Assyrians
till the time of Psammiticus, and was so strong a city, and so well
fortified, that it held out a siege of twenty nine years before he could
be master of it (i); how long Tartan lay against it, before he took it,
is not said; nor is it certain what year he came against it; those who
take Sargon to be Shalmaneser place it in the fourth year of Hezekiah's
reign, who sent Tartan to Ashdod at the same time that he went against
Samaria, [Kg2 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#009.md) but others, who
think Sennacherib is Sargon, fix it to the fourteenth year of Hezekiah's
reign, as Kimchi; who, hearing of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia and Egypt
coming against him, went forth to meet him, and subdued him; and at the
same time sent Tartan against Ashdod; or rather this was done when he
took the fenced cities of Judah, of which this was one, having been
taken a little before by Hezekiah from the Philistines; see [Kg2
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#008.md) though, if Esarhaddon is Sargon,
this must be in the times of Manasseh, perhaps about the twenty second
year of his reign, by whom he was taken, and carried captive; but it is
most likely to have been in Hezekiah's time.

\(h\) T. Bab. Sanhedrin, fol. 94. 1. (i) Herodot. l. 2. c. 157.

[Isaiah 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 20:2</span></span>

At the same time spake the Lord by Isaiah the son of Amoz,.... Or, "by
the hand of Isaiah", by his means; and it was to him likewise, as the
following words show; and so the Septuagint version renders it; he spoke
by him, by the sign he used, according to his order, and he spoke to him
to use the sign:

saying; so the Arabic version, "with him"; and with these versions
Noldius agrees:

go, and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins; a token of mourning, and
which the prophet wore, as Kimchi thinks, because of the captivity of
the ten tribes; and it may be also on account of the miseries that were
coming upon the people of the Jews; though some think this was his
common garb, and the same with the royal garment the prophets used to
wear, [Zac 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#004.md) but that he had put
off, and had put on sackcloth in its room, which he is now bid to take
off:

and put off thy shoe from thy foot; as a sign of distress and mourning
also, [Sa2 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#030.md),

and he did so, walking naked and barefoot; Kimchi thinks this was only
visionally, or in the vision of prophecy, as he calls it, and not in
reality; but the latter seems most probable, and best to agree with what
follows; for he was obedient to the divine command, not regarding the
disgrace which might attend it, nor the danger of catching cold, to
which he was exposed; and hence he has the character of a servant of the
Lord, in the next words, and a faithful obedient one he was.

[Isaiah 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 20:3</span></span>

And the Lord said,.... Here follows the explanation of the sign, and the
accommodation of it to the thing signified by it:

like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot; not wholly
naked, for that would have been very indecent and dangerous indeed; but
without his upper garment, as Saul, [Sa1
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#024.md) and David, [Sa2
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#014.md) or with rent and ragged clothes,
and old shoes, as Jarchi (k) interprets it, and which might be only when
he appeared abroad; and how long he thus walked is not certain, whether
only one day, as some, or three days, as others, or three years, which
is not said, though our version inclines to it; but the three years next
mentioned are not to be joined to Isaiah's walking, but to the thing
signified by it; for the accent "athnach" is at the word which is
rendered "barefoot", and distinguishes this clause from the following.
The Septuagint indeed puts the phrase "three years" into both clauses,
but it only belongs to the latter:

three years for a sign and wonder upon Egypt, and upon Ethiopia; that
is, the prophet's walking naked and barefoot was a sign that three years
after this Egypt and Ethiopia should be subdued by the Assyrians; or,
that so long he should be in subduing them, or their calamities should
last such a term of time. This sign was only seen by the Jews, for whose
sake chiefly this prophecy was, to take off their dependence on the
above nations; though probably this might be made known to the Egyptians
and Ethiopians.

\(k\) T. Bab. Yoma, fol. 77. 1. & Sabbat, fol. 114. 1.

[Isaiah 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 20:4</span></span>

So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and the
Ethiopians captives,.... As beasts are led or driven, being taken
prisoners, and carried captive by the king of Assyria, namely Sargon,
whoever is intended by him:

young and old; without any regard to age, sparing none for their tender
years or gray hairs:

naked and barefoot; as prisoners of war commonly are, being stripped by
their conquerors of their clothes, and having only a few rags given them
to cover their nakedness with, and obliged to travel without shoes on
their feet:

even with their buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt; having no
clothes on them to cover those parts; or the skirts of their garments
cut off, as David's servants were by the Ammonites, [Sa2
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#004.md) and this to humble and mortify
the pride of the Egyptians.

[Isaiah 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 20:5</span></span>

And they shall be afraid and ashamed,.... That is, those that trusted
and depended upon the Egyptians and Ethiopians, particularly the Jews
after mentioned, shall be "afraid" that it will be their turn next, that
they also shall be taken and carried captive; and they shall be
"ashamed" that they have put their trust and confidence in those
nations, and not in the Lord:

of Ethiopia their expectation; from whom they expected assistance and
protection, particularly when Tirhakah king of Ethiopia went out against
the king of Assyria, that he would have been a match for him, and have
overcome him, and so have freed them from such a powerful enemy:

and of Egypt their glory; who was their ally, and a very potent one, and
in whom they gloried; but now should be ashamed, when both those people
on whom they relied were carried captive.

[Isaiah 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 20:6</span></span>

And the inhabitants of this isle shall say, in that day,.... Not of
Ashdod, [Isa 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001.md) or the isle of
Caphtor, [Jer 47:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#004.md) but the land of
Israel, as both Jarchi and Kimchi interpret it; so called, because it
bordered on the sea, as such countries are sometimes called isles; see
[Jer 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#022.md). Ben Melech interprets it
of Jerusalem, and observes that the word signifies a place or country,
whether it has a river or sea encompassing it, or not; besides, the land
of Canaan had the Mediterranean sea on one side of it, and the sea of
Galilee and Tiberias on the other, and was moreover separated from all
other countries by the power, providence, and presence of God:

behold, such is our expectation, whither we flee for help, to be
delivered from the king of Assyria; signifying that it was vain and
foolish, and they had acted a very weak, as well as a wicked part, in
having recourse to the Egyptians and Ethiopians to help them against the
Assyrians, as it plainly appeared by both nations now being conquered by
them:

and how shall we escape? seeing they had not, who were more powerful
than they were; and how could they think that they could save them, who
could not save themselves? and so the Targum,

"if they have not delivered their souls (themselves), how shall we be
delivered?''
