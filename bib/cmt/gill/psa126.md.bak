### [Psalms Chapter 126](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

INTRODUCTION TO PSALM 126

A Song of degrees. This psalm is generally thought to have been written
by Ezra, or some good man returned from the Babylonish captivity, and on
account of it: the inscription in the Syriac version of it, besides
observing it to be a song of degrees or ascents, and without a name, is,

"it is said of Haggai and Zechariah, who came up out of Babylon with the
captives; but spiritually; and it is an expectation of good things to
come.''

It may have respect to redemption by the Messiah; and the conversion of
the Jews in the latter day.

[Psalms 126:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 126:1</span></span>

When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion,.... Or returned the
Jews from their captivity in Babylon; who are called Zion, from the city
of David, built on Mount Zion, which was in Judea, and adjoined to
Jerusalem, the metropolis of the kingdom; and because they were the
godly who were concerned for Zion in a spiritual sense, or the church of
God, and the interest of religion, whose spirits the Lord stirred up to
come out of Babylon, upon the proclamation by Cyrus, when those that
were more worldly and carnal stayed behind; as also because the chief
mercy in returning the captives was the rebuilding the temple on Mount
Zion, and the restoration of religious worship; which gave the religious
captives in Babylon great concern, [Psa
137:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#001.md). This deliverance of the
captives, though it was by Cyrus as an instrument, yet it was the Lord's
work; which he employed him in, and stirred him up to do, and therefore
is ascribed to him. And though this is expressed in the past tense, yet
it may be put for the future; and be considered as a prophecy of it, and
which the following word seems to confirm; and especially the prayer,
[Psa 126:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#004.md); for the return of the
captivity seems to require it should: and may not only literally respect
the return of the captives in Babylon, but the conversion of the Jews in
the latter day, and their deliverance from their present captivity;
which is expressed sometimes by the Lord's bringing again Zion, and
returning the captivity of the Jews, and their being turned to the Lord,
[Isa 52:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#008.md); and may be applied to
spiritual and eternal redemption by Christ, of which the deliverance
from Babylon was a type; and is sometimes expressed in the same
language, [Psa 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#007.md); and the people
redeemed are often signified by Zion, and are by nature captives to sin,
Satan, and the law; from whence they are redeemed by Christ, whose work
alone it is, [Isa 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#027.md);

we were like them that dream; or "shall be" (p); that is, as persons
that know not whether they are asleep or awake; and whether what they
see and enjoy is in reality or only a vision, as Peter's deliverance
from prison was to him, [Act 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#009.md);
When the proclamation by Cyrus was first heard of by the Jews, and they
had their liberty upon it, they could hardly tell whether it was a real
thing or a vision, and could scarcely believe it for joy; it seemed too
good news to be true, as the news of Joseph's being alive was to Jacob,
[Gen 45:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#026.md); and so the appearance of
Christ, his resurrection, and redemption by him, were to the disciples,
[Luk 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#011.md). The Targum is,

"we were like the sick that are recovered;''

which sense the word has in [Job 39:4](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#004.md);
and will be the case of the Jews, when they are converted; who will be
recovered out of the sick state and condition in which they now are, and
have all their diseases healed, and sins forgiven; yea, their conversion
will be as life from the dead, a resurrection of them from their graves,
[Rom 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#015.md). The Septuagint, Vulgate
Latin, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions, render it, "as those that are
comforted"; and the Syriac version, "as those that rejoice"; each of the
seasons mentioned being times of comfort and joy: Joseph Kimchi
interprets it of the passing away and forgetfulness of affliction and
trouble at the time of redemption, like a dream that flies away upon
awaking.

[Psalms 126:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 126:2</span></span>

Then was our mouth filled with laughter,.... Who before mourned, and
hung their harps on the willows, and could not sing the Lord's song in a
strange land; but now, as their hearts were filled, with joy, this was
externally and visibly seen in their countenances, and expressed with
their mouths and by outward gestures; it was so great, they could not
contain it, to which respect is had, [Isa
35:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#010.md). It may be rendered, "then shall
our mouth be filled with laughter" (q); that is, when we awake, says
Arama; or rather when the captivity is returned, either in a literal or
in a spiritual sense, both being matter of great joy: the Midrash says,
this will be in the world to come, and not in this;

and our tongue with singing; the praises of God, and the songs of Zion;

then said they among the Heathen, the Lord hath done great things for
them; it was taken notice of by the Chaldeans, among whom they had been
captives, and by all the nations round about: and it was wonderful to
them, that Cyrus, an Heathen prince, of his own motion and will, should
at once, and without any price or reward, let them go, and send them
into their own country to rebuild their temple; and with them the
vessels of the Lord's house, that had been taken away by the king of
Babylon; and order men to help them, with gold and silver, and goods and
cattle, [Ezr 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001.md). Likewise the
conversion of the Jews, and the restoration of them to their own and in
the latter day, will be observed by the Gentiles with wonder, and as the
work of God, [Eze 36:35](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#035.md).

\(q\) "replebitur", Musculus, Gejerus; "implebitur", Schmidt; so the
Targum, Syr. Arab.

[Psalms 126:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 126:3</span></span>

The Lord hath done great things for us,.... These words are generally
supposed to be the words of the Jews, taking up those of the Gentiles,
and confirming them; acknowledging that the Lord had done great things
for them indeed; which, had they not owned, they would have been
exceeding ungrateful; had they been silent concerning them, the stones
would have cried out, and the very Heathens condemned them. But I see
not why they may not be thought to be the words of those among the
Heathens continued; declaring that the great things done were not for
the Jews only, but for them also; as the great redemption by Christ is
of persons out of every tongue, people, and nation; for he is the
propitiation, not for the Jews only, but for the sins of the whole
world; and having this in view, thus they express themselves. The work
of redemption is a great thing of itself; the produce of great wisdom;
the effect of great love; procured at a great price, for great sinners,
by a great Saviour; and is not only a deliverance from sin, Satan, and
the law; but contains many great and glorious blessings in it, as
justification, remission of sins, adoption, and eternal life;

whereof we are glad; that those great things are done without us,
finished by the Redeemer himself; that they are so great and glorious,
so rich and plenteous, so full and free, and suitable to us; and done
for us sinners of the Gentiles, so unworthy of them, who are by nature
children of wrath as others.

[Psalms 126:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 126:4</span></span>

Turn again our captivity, O Lord,.... This prayer for the return of the
captivity shows that it was not as yet: though some think that this is a
petition of those that were returned from captivity, for those of their
brethren that stayed behind; who, enjoying the sweets of their liberty,
pray for their brethren to come and share with them, that so the mercy
and blessing might be completed. This may very well be considered as a
petition; either for the coming of the Redeemer, and redemption by him
from the captivity of sin and Satan, and the law; or for the conversion
of the Jews in the latter day. Either of which would be

as the streams in the south; as great and wonderful a work as causing
rivers to be in dry places, and as grateful and acceptable as brooks and
streams of water in southern countries: or like streams produced by the
south wind, which brings rain, and melts the snow from the hills; which,
running into the valleys, cause flows of water in great abundance: and
so may denote the abundance of those that should share in the blessings
of conversion, redemption, and salvation; as well as the wonderfulness
and acceptableness of them; see [Isa
41:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#018.md). The Targum seems to understand
it of the change made upon them, like that made on the earth by those;
paraphrasing the words,

"as the land is turned, when streams of water flow out in a time of
drought.''

The allusion seems to be to Judea, lying south of Babylon; and to the
southern parts of Judea, which were dry; see [Jos
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#019.md).

[Psalms 126:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 126:5</span></span>

They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. A proverbial expression,
encouraging faith in prayer put up for the return of the captivity,
whether in a literal or spiritual sense. Praying or seeking the Lord is
sowing in righteousness, [Hos 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#012.md);
which is often attended with tears and weeping; the issue of them is not
always seen soon: these, like seed, lie buried under the clods, but take
effect and will rise up in due time: saints should wait patiently for a
return of them, as the husbandman for the fruits of the earth; in due
time they will produce a large crop of blessings, a plentiful harvest,
which the praying saint will reap with joy; as those that prayed and
waited for the redemption in Jerusalem; and as those that pray for the
latter day glory, the conversion of the Jews, the fulness of the
Gentiles, and the destruction of antichrist; the souls under the altar
have been sowing in tears, but before long they will reap in joy, [Rev
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#009.md). It may be applied to the state
and condition of saints in common in this life; now is their sowing
time, and careful they should be that they sow not to the flesh, but to
the spirit: and a sorrowful time it is, on account of inward
corruptions, Satan's temptations, divine desertions, and the
imperfection of their services; but before long they will reap life
everlasting, reap in joy, and be in the fulness of it; now they weep,
then they shall rejoice; now they mourn, then they shall be comforted.

[Psalms 126:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 126:6</span></span>

He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed,.... Which he
sows in tears. This is but a repetition and confirmation of what is
before expressed in different words; and may be applied, as to a praying
saint, so to a faithful preacher of the word. The word is the precious
seed which he bears, which he takes out of the granaries of the
Scriptures; and carries from place to place, and scatters and sows, [Luk
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#011.md); compared to seed, because of its
meanness in the eyes of those that know it not; because of its
generative virtue and increase, which it has from God, and which, unless
sown in the earth, produces no fruit: and it is called "precious seed",
because either bought at a great price, when grain is dear; or because
it usually is the choicest wheat that is the sowing seed; and so may
denote the preciousness and value of the Gospel, dispensed by Christ's
faithful ministers, which is called a sowing of spiritual things, [Co1
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#011.md); which should be done plentifully
and constantly, and with the same sort of seed or doctrine, and which
requires art and skill; and is often performed weeping or with tears,
because of their own insufficiency, through fear of success, and through
want of it; and because of the badness of the ground, the hardness of
men's hearts they have to do with. The allusion seems to be to a poor
husbandman, that has got but little seed to sow, and this bought at a
dear price; and which he buries under the clods, and fears it will rise
no more; and weeps as he sows, because of the badness of the weather, or
of the soil, doubting of success. Aben Ezra, by the words rendered
"precious seed", or, as they may be, "a draught of seed" (r),
understands the vessel in which the sower carries his seed, the seed
basket, from whence he draws and takes out the seed, and scatters it;
see [Amo 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#013.md); so the Targum,

"bearing a tray of sowing corn;''

shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with
him; the seed he has been to and fro in sowing springs up under a divine
blessing; and, beyond his expectation and fears, produces a large and
plentiful crop; which he reaps, and returns home, not with his arms full
of sheaves only, but with his cart laden with them: so a faithful
minister, sooner or later, is blessed with converts, who will be his joy
and crown of rejoicing another day: see [Joh
4:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#035.md), [Th1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#019.md).
