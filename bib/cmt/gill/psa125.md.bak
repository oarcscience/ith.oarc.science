[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

INTRODUCTION TO PSALM 125

A Song of degrees. Who was the penman of this psalm, and on what
occasion written, is not certain. It describes the safety and security
of the church and people of God; foretells the deliverance of them from
the oppressions of their enemies; the blessings of goodness that should
be bestowed upon them, and the vengeance that will be taken on the
wicked. According to Aben Ezra, it belongs to the times of the Messiah,
whom the Jews yet expect; when Israel, as they suppose, will be in safe
and prosperous circumstances, and the wicked will be consumed; as Kimchi
on it also observes: and, indeed, it may be very well thought to belong
to the latter days of the kingdom of our Messiah; when the church will
be in great safety and prosperity, and freed from the persecution and
afflictions of wicked men.

[Psalms 125:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 125:1</span></span>

They that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Zion,.... Who trust not in
themselves, and in their own hearts; nor in anything of theirs, their
strength or wisdom, riches or righteousness; nor in any creature
whatever, in the mightiest or best of men; but in the Lord; in God, as
the God of nature and providence, for all temporal mercies; and in him,
as the God of grace, for all spiritual and eternal ones; who should be
trusted in at all times, whether of affliction, temptation, or darkness;
for which there is abundant reason. The Targum is,

"the righteous that trust in the Word of the Lord;''

in Christ the essential Word, who is trusted in by all that know him,
and that know there is salvation in him, and in no other: these trust in
him for acceptance with God, for a justifying righteousness, for
remission of sin, for all supplies of grace, and for eternal life; and
such are like Mount Zion for many things, being beloved and chosen of
God, enjoying his presence, and the blessings of his grace; and being
the joy of the whole earth, and a perfection of beauty; but here for
their firmness and stability, as follows. Arama observes, that Mount
Zion is made mention of, because here the prophecy was given; to which
may be added, the psalmist was upon it, and had it in view, when he
compared those that trust in the Lord unto it;

which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever: either, which Mount Zion
is immovable, and continually abides, for which reason the church and
people of God are compared unto it; or everyone of those that trust in
the Lord, like that, can never be removed, but always abide: they can
never be removed from the Lord, though they may be removed from his
house and ordinances, as sometimes David was; and from his gracious
presence, and sensible communion with him, and out of the world by
death; yet never from his heart's love, nor out of the covenant of his
grace, which is sure and everlasting; nor out of his family, into which
they are taken; nor from the Lord Jesus Christ, nor out of his hands and
arms, nor from off his heart; nor from off him, the foundation on which
they are laid; nor out of a state of grace, either regeneration or
justification; but such abide in the love of God, in the covenant of his
grace, in the hands of his Son, in the grace wherein they stand, and in
the house of God for evermore.

[Psalms 125:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 125:2</span></span>

As the mountains are round about Jerusalem,.... There was Mount Zion on
the side of the north, and the mount of Olives on the east, and other
mountains on the other sides of it; so that it was encompassed with
them, and was naturally as well as artificially fortified. Tacitus (k)
describes Jerusalem as inaccessible, walls and mountains, rocks and
towers, surrounding it: and the poet Coerilus (l) makes mention of a
people that spoke the Phoenician language, by whom he plainly means the
Jews, ' , "that inhabited the mountains of Solyma"; which are spoken of
by Homer (m), from whence, according to Tacitus (n), Jerusalem had its
name: yet, as Kimchi observes, this did not hinder the enemy from taking
it; wherefore the Lord is a greater security to his people;

so the Lord is round about his people, from henceforth even for ever; he
encompasses them with his favour and lovingkindness as a shield; he
encircles them in the arms of everlasting love; he guards them by his
providence all around, and keeps a wakeful and watchful eye over them,
that nothing hurts them: he keeps them, as in a garrison, by his
almighty power: these are the walls that are around them, yea, he
himself is a wall of fire about them, and the glory in the midst of
them, [Zac 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#005.md); and so he continues;
he never leaves his people, nor forsakes them, but is their God and
guide even unto death. The Targum is,

"the Word of the Lord is round about his people;''

Christ, the essential Word of God.

[Psalms 125:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 125:3</span></span>

For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the
righteous,.... Which, according to Kimchi, is Jerusalem; but Aben Ezra
interprets it of the Israelites that inherit the land. And, the people
of God are no doubt designed; the Lord's justified and chosen ones, his
portion, and the lot of his inheritance; and all that belong unto them,
their persons, families, estates, and good name: in all which they are
sometimes oppressed and afflicted by wicked men; who are a rod of
correction in the hand of the Lord, the rod of men with which he
chastises them; but this shall not always continue: so the word is used
for a rod of correction, [Pro 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#015.md).
It sometimes signifies a sceptre; an ensign of power and government,
[Gen 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md); and here may intend the
nations of the world, as Aben Ezra interprets it; or the antichristian
states, prevailing and ruling over the people of God in a tyrannical
manner, which shall not always last; the reign of antichrist will come
to an end, and the Lord will destroy him with the rod of his mouth. It
sometimes signifies a tribe; and the Syriac version seems so to take it
here,

"the tribe of the wicked shall not rest in the part of the righteous;''

they shall no more dwell among them, lest, being led by their example,
they should learn their works, and do as they do; so Aben Ezra and
Kimchi. But rather, with Gussetius (o), this is to be understood of a
measuring rod; laid not on persons, but on lands and estates; and best
agrees with the lot, inheritance, and estate of the righteous; and may
signify, that though wicked men unjustly seize upon and retain the
farms, possessions, and estates of good men, as if they were assigned to
them by the measuring line; yet should not hold them long, or always;

lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity; for the
righteous are not perfect in this life: they are not without sin, nor do
they live without the commission of it; and may be under temptation, by
long afflictions and oppressions, and seeing the wicked prosper, to
desert their profession of religion, and forsake the ways of God, and
join with the wicked, and commit iniquity as they do; and therefore, to
prevent this, the Lord will not suffer them always to be under
affliction and oppression; see [Psa
37:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#008.md), or them and theirs to be always
in the hand of the enemy.

[Psalms 125:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 125:4</span></span>

Do good, O Lord, unto those that be good,.... That are made so by the
Spirit and grace of God; for none are naturally good, but evil; only
such who are regenerated and made new creatures, who have a good work of
grace begun in them; who have the good Spirit of God, and his good
graces, and the good word of God in them, and are filled with all
goodness; and which is known by the good fruits which they bear, or the
good works done by them. For these the psalmist prays the Lord would do
good to them, not only in a providential way, as he does to all; but in
a way of special grace, bestowing the blessings of his goodness on them,
and causing all things to work for their good: and as saints should pray
for one another, or supplication should be made for all saints, such a
prayer as this may be the prayer of faith; for it is not to be doubted
but God will do good to those he makes good. Aben Ezra says this may be
considered either as a prayer or a prophecy; it may have respect unto
the church in the latter day, and to the good things spoken of
concerning it; which God will accomplish in due time, and should be
prayed for; see [Psa 51:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#018.md);

and to them that are upright in their hearts; which is a further
description of good men, from the integrity and sincerity of their
hearts; who do all they do before God and men, in the uprightness of
their souls, cordially and sincerely, from right principles, and with
right views.

[Psalms 125:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 125:5</span></span>

As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways,.... The ways of sin,
immorality, or error; which are crooked ways, not agreeing with the word
of God, the rule of faith and practice. This seems to design not openly
profane sinners, who have always lived in a course of sin and
wickedness; but carnal professors, who, through affliction and
persecution because of the word, are offended, and desert the good ways
of God; and turn from the holy commandment, word, and ordinances, they
have professionally embraced;

the Lord shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity; the Targum
adds,

"to hell.''

These hypocrites shall be led forth by the Lord with abandoned sinners,
like malefactors to the place of execution; when he shall bid them
depart from him, and they shall go into everlasting fire; and if there
is any place in hell hotter than another, those shall have it; see [Mat
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#023.md);

but peace shall be upon Israel; upon every true Israelite, upon the
whole Israel of God; the apostle seems to have respect to this passage
in [Gal 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#016.md); such shall have
spiritual peace in their hearts now, and eternal peace hereafter. The
words may be read either as a prayer that it might be, or as a prophecy
that it should be; and may have regard unto the latter day, when all the
enemies of Christ and his church shall be destroyed, and there shall be
abundance of peace, so long as the moon endures, [Psa
72:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#007.md). Aben Ezra observes, that the
psalmist prays that God would remove the wicked far off, and then there
would be peace in Israel; and to the same purpose Arama and Kimchi
interpret it.
