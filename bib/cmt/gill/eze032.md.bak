INTRODUCTION TO EZEKIEL 32

This chapter contains two more prophecies concerning the destruction of
Egypt. The date of the first is given, [Eze
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#001.md), in which the king of Egypt is
compared to a large fish taken in a net, and brought to land, and left
on it, to be the prey of the fowls of the air and beasts of the field,
[Eze 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#002.md), and the ruin of that
kingdom is further amplified by the casting of it on the mountains and
valleys; by the land flowing with its blood; by the darkness of the
heavens; by the vexation in the hearts of many people; and by the
amazement of kings and nations, [Eze
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#005.md), the means and instruments of all
which will be the king of Babylon and his army, [Eze
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#011.md), the devastation made by him,
which would be such as would cause lamentation in other nations, is
described, [Eze 32:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#013.md), then follows
the other prophecy, whose date is given, [Eze
32:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#017.md), the prophet is bid to lament
the fall of Egypt, which is represented under the funeral of a corpse,
[Eze 32:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#018.md), saluted by those gone down
to the grave before, or were become desolate; which are mentioned, to
assure Egypt of its destruction, [Eze
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#021.md) as the Assyrian empire, and all
its provinces, [Eze 32:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#022.md), the
Persians and Medes, with all their dominions, [Eze
32:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#024.md), the posterity of Meshech and
Tubal, or the Scythians, those warlike people, [Eze
32:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#026.md), the Edomites, the princes of
the north, and all the Zidonians, [Eze
32:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#029.md) which would be a comfort, though
a poor one to the king of Egypt and his subjects, to have such company
with them, [Eze 32:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#031.md).

[Ezekiel 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 32:1</span></span>

And it came to pass in the twelfth year,.... Of Jeconiah's captivity,
above a year and a half after the taking of Jerusalem; the Syriac
version reads in the eleventh year:

in the twelfth month, in the first day of the month; the month Adar,
which answers to part of our February, and part of March; the Septuagint
version reads it the tenth month: according to Bishop Usher (t), this
was on the twenty second of March, on the fourth day of the week
(Wednesday), 3417 A.M.or 587 years before Christ:

that the word of the Lord came unto me, saying; as follows:

\(t\) Annales Vet. Test. A. M. 3417.

[Ezekiel 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 32:2</span></span>

Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt,....
Pharaohhophra, or Apries; say a funeral dirge for him; this is ordered,
not out of honour and respect to him, or in compassion for his misery
and ruin, but to assure him of it:

and say unto him, thou art like a young lion of the nations; for
strength and fierceness, for cruelty and tyranny, which he exercised,
not in one nation only, but in many; a lively emblem of the beast of
Rome, spiritually called Egypt and Sodom, compared to a leopard, bear,
and lion, [Rev 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#008.md),

and thou art as a whale in the seas; or rather "like a crocodile" (u),
which was common in the rivers of Egypt, but not the whale; which also
has not scales, nor does it go upon land, nor is it taken in a net; all
which is said of this creature here, and in [Eze
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003.md) and to the crocodile there is an
allusion in the name of Pharaoh, in the Arabic language, as Noldius from
Camius observes (w); see [Eze 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003.md),

and thou camest forth with thy rivers; or, "by thy rivers" (x); as the
crocodile in the river Nile, by the arms of it, or canals made out of
it, sometimes went out from thence to other parts: or, "out of thy
rivers" (y) upon the land, as the crocodile does; so the king of Egypt
went forth with his armies out of his own land, into other countries, to
disturb them, as follows: or rather, "camest forth in thy rivers" (z);
as the crocodile puts forth its head out of the water for respiration:

and thou troublest the waters with thy feet, and foulest their rivers;
just as the feet of men or beasts, in shallow waters, raise up the mud
or clay at the bottom, and so foul them; this best agrees with the
crocodile, which has feet; Grotius thinks, for this reason, the sea
horse is intended; the meaning is, that Pharaoh with his soldiers
entered other nations, made war upon them, and disturbed their peace and
tranquillity. The Targum is,

"thou hast been strong among the people, as a whale in the seas, thou
hast fought with thine army; and thou hast moved the people with thine
auxiliaries, and thou hast wasted their provinces.''

[Ezekiel 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 32:3</span></span>

Thus saith the Lord God,.... The Lord God Almighty, who is able to
manage this fierce and turbulent creature, this mighty monarch and
disturber of the nations:

I will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many
people; meaning the Chaldean army, which the Lord would instigate, and
by his providence bring against the king of Egypt, and surround him as
fishes in a net, and take him and his people; see [Eze
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#013.md),

and they shall bring thee up in my net; out of his rivers, out of his
fortresses, out of his own land, and carry him captive, or destroy him.

[Ezekiel 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 32:4</span></span>

Then will I leave thee upon the land,.... Like a fish that is drawn out
of the waters with a net or hook, and laid on dry land, and left gasping
and expiring, where it cannot long live:

I will cast thee forth on the open field; the same in different words,
signifying that his army should fall in battle by the sword of the
Cyreneans, or Chaldeans, or both, and be left on the surface of the
earth unburied:

and will cause all the fowls of the heavens to remain upon thee, and I
will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee; which may be
understood either literally of the fowls of the air, that should light
upon the slain carcasses, and rest on them till they had satisfied
themselves with their flesh; and of the beasts of the field that should
gather about them from all parts, and fill themselves with them; see
[Rev 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#017.md) or figuratively of the
soldiers of the enemy's army, that should plunder them, and enrich
themselves with the spoil.

[Ezekiel 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 32:5</span></span>

And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains,.... The remainder of it,
left by the birds and beasts of prey, and who might carry it thither; or
it intends such of the Egyptians who should flee to the mountains for
safety, but should fall by the hands of the enemy there. So the Targum,

"and I will give the flesh of thy slain upon the mountains.''

And fill the valleys with thy height; his huge army, and with which he
prided and lifted up himself, and thought himself safe in; which should
fall in such great numbers as to cover the plains and valleys where the
battle was fought. Jarchi observes, that the word for "height" has with
some the signification of "worms"; and so the Syriac version renders it,
"and the valleys shall be filled with thy worms"; bred in the carcasses
of the slain: and so the Vulgate Latin version, "with corrupt matter";
such as issues out of putrefied wounds. The Targum very rightly
paraphrases it,

"the valleys shall be filled with the carcasses of thine army.''

[Ezekiel 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 32:6</span></span>

And I will also water with thy blood the land wherewith thou
swimmest,.... Where he resided, over which he ruled; alluding to his
being compared to a fish, a whale, or a crocodile; and which land
abounded with all good things, and he with them; instead of being
watered with the waters of the Nile, by which it became fruitful, it
should now be flooded with the blood of his army:

even to the mountains; an hyperbolical expression, signifying the vast
quantity of blood that should be shed; see the like in [Rev
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#020.md),

and the rivers shall be full of them; of the carcasses of his army, and
of the blood of them; they should lie about everywhere, on mountains and
valleys, on the land and in the rivers; and which should now be turned
into blood, as the rivers of Egypt of old were; and which figure is used
to express the destruction of the antichristian states; see [Exo
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#020.md).

[Ezekiel 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 32:7</span></span>

And when I shall put thee out,.... As a candle is put out, or some great
light or blazing torch is extinguished; such was the king of Egypt in
his splendour and glory; but now should be like a lamp put out in
obscure darkness, and all his brightness and glory removed from him,
[Job 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#005.md),

I will cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof dark; with the smoke
that should arise at the extinguishing of this lamp; or they should be
covered with mourning, or clad in black, at the destruction of this
monarch and his monarchy:

I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her
light; all which figures are sometimes made use of to denote the
dissolution of kingdoms and states: the "heaven" being an emblem of a
kingdom itself; the "sun" of an emperor or king, or kingly power; the
"moon" of the queen, or of the priesthood; the "stars" of nobles,
princes, counsellors, and such like eminent persons, useful in
government; who being destroyed or removed, the light and glory, the
prosperity and happiness of a kingdom, are gone; see [Isa
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#010.md). The Targum is,

"tribulation shall cover thee when I shall extinguish the splendour of
the glory of thy kingdom from heaven; and the people of thine army shall
be lessened, who are many as the stars; a king with his army shall cover
thee as a cloud that ascends and covers the sun, and as the moon, whose
light does not shine in the day.''

[Ezekiel 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 32:8</span></span>

All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee,.... Or, "all
the lights of the light" (a); the rest of the luminaries of heaven; the
other five planets, as Kimchi, besides the sun and moon:

and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord God; as there must needs
be, the sun, moon, and stars, and all the lights of heaven, being
darkened above: there seems to be an allusion to the thick darkness that
was formerly over the land of Egypt; and this is a figure and
representation of that darkness that shall be in the kingdom of the
beast, or spiritual Egypt, yet to come; see [Exo
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#021.md). The Targum is,

"tribulation as darkness shall cover thy land.''

\(a\) "omnia luminaria lucis", Pagninus, Montanus, Cocceius.

[Ezekiel 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 32:9</span></span>

I will also vex the hearts of many people,.... With anger and grief,
with fear and dread, with consternation and amazement:

when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations; or, "thy breach"
(b); the news of it, the tidings of their destruction; which by one
means or another should come to their ears, and fill them with concern
and great anxiety of mind, so rich and powerful a kingdom being subdued,
and the king of Babylon made so great thereby, and fearing they fall a
prey unto him also. The Targum renders it,

"when I shall bring the broken of thy war;''

that is, the soldiers that should be wounded in battle, their limbs
broke, and they taken captive, and brought among the nations, dismal
spectacles to look at; and which should be brought

into countries, which thou hast not known; at a distance from Egypt, and
which had no commerce nor communication with them, nor were their
friends and allies; yet as their destruction would reach their ears, so
it would affect their hearts, and fill them with vexation and grief; not
so much on account of Egypt, as the growing power of Nebuchadnezzar, and
the danger they were in of falling into his hands.

\(b\) "fractionem tuam", Piscator, Cocceius, Starckius.

[Ezekiel 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 32:10</span></span>

Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee,.... That so potent a state,
and such a flourishing kingdom, should at once be so easily subdued and
conquered: and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee; because of
her destruction, lest their turn should be next; so the kings of the
earth will be afraid when God's judgments are executed on mystical
Egypt; see [Rev 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#009.md),

when I shall brandish my sword before them; the sword of the king of
Babylon after mentioned, called the Lord's, because it was by his
appointment and permission, and came by the direction of his providence,
and was succeeded by his power: this glittering sword being brandished
over Egypt, in the sight of the nations round about, was terrible to
them; dreading that it would not be put up until it was sheathed in
them, or they felt the effects of it:, or, "when I shall cause it to fly
before them" (c); in their sight, and upon the borders of their
countries; expressive of the swiftness of its motion, the sudden
destruction it brought on Egypt, and its nearness to them. The Targum
is,

"when I shall bring upon thee those that kill with the sword.''

And they shall tremble at every moment; from moment to moment, or
continually; they shall never be free from fear:

every man for his own life, in the day of thy fall; not kings for their
subjects, or subjects for their kings, but every man for himself;
expecting every moment that the sword which flew and ravaged through
Egypt, and now hovered over them, would be instantly plunged in them.

\(c\) "cum volare fecero", Munster, Tigurine version. Abendaus mentions
such a sense of the word.

[Ezekiel 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 32:11</span></span>

For thus saith the Lord God, the sword of the king of Babylon shall come
upon thee. Upon Pharaoh and his kingdom; having a commission and a
direction from the Lord, and which would be the instrument of the
destruction before threatened. The Targum is,

"those that slay with the sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon
or against thee;''

his army, sword in hand.

[Ezekiel 32:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 32:12</span></span>

By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall,....
Pharaoh's numerous subjects; or his army, as the Targum; the vast number
of soldiers in it, whose carcasses should fall in battle by the sword of
the Chaldeans, the mighty men of Nebuchadnezzar's army:

the terrible of the nations all of them; which army consisted of men of
several nations, and those the most terrible, fierce, and cruel, by
whose swords this slaughter should be made:

and they shall spoil the pomp of Egypt; cut off the king, the princes of
the blood, the nobility and gentry, the prime of the nation; plunder the
king's palace of all the wealth and riches in it, the treasury of the
kingdom; destroy the metropolis of it; demolish its cities and fortified
places, and take away all its strength and glory:

and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed: all the people of the
land, high and low, rich and poor; the destruction shall be general, all
ranks and degrees of men shall share in it.

[Ezekiel 32:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 32:13</span></span>

I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great
waters,.... Which used to graze beside the river Nile, and the canal, of
it, in the plains and meadows, valley, and hills, which these ran by;
meaning both horses, which Egypt abounded with, and would be good booty
for the Chaldeans, and oxen and sheep, which they would kill for present
use, or drive away for future service:

neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of
beasts trouble them; there should so few remain of men and beasts, that
the waters of the rivers would not be disturbed, either by men passing
over them, and doing any business upon them, or by beasts drinking at
them.

[Ezekiel 32:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 32:14</span></span>

Then will l make their waters deep,.... Either the water, of Egypt
literally, the waters of the Nile: no canals being cut from it, to carry
the water to the several parts of the land, the land being depopulated,
and no business done: or, figuratively, other nations, compared to
waters for their numbers, who before had been disturbed by the
Egyptians; but now they being destroyed, these would be at ease, like
troubled waters, which subside, and: become deep and clear, when there
is none to trouble them:

and cause their, rivers to run like oil, saith the Lord God; very
slowly, as if, they were mourning the unhappy condition of the land; or
smoothly, clearly, undisturbed, as before. The Targum is,

"there will I cause the people to rest, and I will lead their kings
quietly, saith the Lord God.''

[Ezekiel 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 32:15</span></span>

When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate,.... The cities being
demolished, the inhabitants destroyed with the sword, or carried
captive:

and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full; men and
cattle, corn and other fruits of the earth, wealth and riches, pomp and
grandeur:

when I shall smite all them that dwell therein; with the sword of the
Chaldeans:

then shall they know that I am the Lord for God is known in the
perfections of his nature, omnipotence, omniscience, holiness, justice,
&c. by the judgments he executes; for this is not to be understood of a
spiritual knowledge of him, but of a terrible conviction of the truth of
his being and attributes, by the awful dispensations of his providence.

[Ezekiel 32:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 32:16</span></span>

This is the lamentation with which they shall lament her,.... The
Egyptians themselves, or rather they that are after mentioned. The
Targum is,

"the prophet said, a lamentation is this prophecy, and it shall be for a
lamentation;''

he was bid at the beginning of it to take up a lamentation, and now at
the end of it he pronounces it to be one, and that it should be sung as
such:

the daughters of the nations shall lament for her; either literally
understood, it being the business and custom of women to say or sing the
funeral dirge, or the lamentation at the interment of the deceased; or
figuratively, the inhabitants of other nations. So Ben Melech and the
Targum,

"the villages of the people shall lament her'';

that is, the inhabitants of them, who were in alliance with Egypt, and
under its protection:

they shall lament for her, even for Egypt, and for all her multitude;
for the desolation of the land, and for the vast numbers of people that
should be slain with the sword, or carried captive:

saith the Lord God; which is added for the confirmation of it; for what
he has spoken shall be done.

[Ezekiel 32:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 32:17</span></span>

It came to pass also the twelfth year,.... Another prophecy of the like
kind was delivered out the same year as before:

in the fifteenth day of the month; of the twelfth month, the month Adar,
which is not here expressed, because mentioned before, [Eze
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#001.md), it was about a fortnight after
the other prophecy. The Septuagint and Arabic versions read it,

"it came to pass in the twelfth year, the first month, the fifteenth day
of the month;''

according to which this prophecy was before the other, which is not to
be supposed.

[Ezekiel 32:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 32:18</span></span>

Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt,.... Sing a funeral song or
dirge, or compose one, to be sung by the mourning women, on account of
the vast numbers of the inhabitants of Egypt that shall be slain; for
the prophet himself would not mourn, but rejoice, on this occasion; but
this is said to show the certainty of the destruction, and the
lamentation that would be made on that account:

and cast them down, even her and the daughters of the famous nations;
Egypt, and all those countries, and the inhabitants of them, that were
in alliance and friendship with her; that is, declare by prophecy that
they shall be cast down and destroyed, or be brought down from the
height of grandeur and prosperity in which they now were:

unto the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down to the pit;
not unto stately sepulchres built on high, such as were made for the
kings of Egypt; but unto common pits or graves, dug in the lower parts
of the earth, where the meaner and common sort of people were buried;
there should be no distinction between them and others, they should have
one common burial. The Targum is,

"son of man, prophesy concerning the multitude of Egypt, and break her,
even her, and the villages of the mighty people; prophesy that they
shall be delivered unto the lowest earth, with those that go down to the
pit of the house of perdition.''

[Ezekiel 32:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 32:19</span></span>

Whom dost thou pass in beauty?.... This question the prophet is bid to
put to Egypt; what nation is there, or has been, that thou excellest in
wisdom, in riches, or in strength, in the multitude of subjects, or
extent of dominions, that thou thinkest thyself secure from destruction?
look over other kingdoms and states mightier than thou, or at least
equal to thee, and see how they are brought to ruin, and expect that
this will quickly be thy case:

go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised; go down to the grave,
and take thy place, and lie there among the wicked and most profligate
of mankind, and such as might be most despised by the Egyptians, since
they used circumcision. The Targum is,

"go down and sleep with sinners.''

[Ezekiel 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 32:20</span></span>

They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword,....
The Egyptians shall fall in battle by the sword of the Chaldeans:

she is delivered to the sword; Egypt is given to the sword, to perish by
it, for her sins, according to the just appointment of God:

draw her and all her multitudes; to the place of burial; not in pomp and
splendour, as great persons are drawn in hearses; but in great disgrace,
as carcasses are dragged unto a common pit or grave, and cast into it:
this is said to the Chaldeans, who had a commission from the Lord to
slay Egypt, and to bury her, and all her people.

[Ezekiel 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 32:21</span></span>

The strong among the mighty shall speak to him,.... The strongest of
them, such who have excelled others in strength and courage, famous for
military exploits, who have been generals of armies, great warriors, and
conquerors; and yet with all their might and strength could not
withstand death, but were subdued by it, and brought down to the grave;
these are, by a poetical figure, represented as meeting Pharaoh king of
Egypt, when he came to his grave, saluting and welcoming him to the
state of the dead in which they were; taking a sort of comfort in it,
and insulting him as being as weak as they; see [Isa
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009.md), which they should do

out of the midst of hell, or the grave, "Hades", the state of the dead:

with them that help him; the associates, allies, and friends of Pharaoh,
his auxiliaries that fell with him, and were brought to the grave at the
same time with him; these should be greeted, saluted, and welcomed in
like manner:

they are gone down; to the grave; those mighty ones that are represented
as speaking, and the Egyptians and their helpers who are spoken to:

they lie uncircumcised; among them that are so, [Eze
32:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#019.md),

slain by the sword; of their enemies, who got the victory over them.

[Ezekiel 32:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 32:22</span></span>

Ashur is there, and all her company,.... In the state of the dead, or in
a most desolate and ruinous condition; the great Assyrian monarchy, the
kings of it, the princes, nobles, generals, soldiers, and the vast
number of subjects in all the dominions of it; all his army, as the
Targum; this, with what follows, shows who the mighty are, that should
meet and address the king of Egypt at his funeral:

his graves are about him; either the graves of Pharaoh and his multitude
are round about the graves of the Assyrian monarch and his subjects, as
Kimchi; or rather the graves of his subjects and soldiers are round
about him: it seems to represent the king of Assyria as having a more
stately monument, and the graves of his people as lesser ones round
about him, but all in the same condition:

all of them slain, fallen by the sword of their enemies, the Medes and
the Babylonians, by whom the Assyrian monarchy was destroyed.

[Ezekiel 32:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 32:23</span></span>

Whose graves are set in the sides of the pit,.... Or vault, where lay
the king of Assyria, and those who fell by the sword with him, who are
represented as lying in graves all around him; the nearest to him those
who were in the highest posts, and most valiant and courageous, and next
the common soldiers, as follows:

and her company is round about her grave not Pharaoh's company round
about the grave of the Assyrian monarch; but the company of the king of
Assyria, or his army, as the Targum, round about grave; or lying about
in the ruins of his kingdom:

all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which caused terror in the land
of the living; even they who now are in the state of the dead, and can
no more disturb and distress any, while they were alive, or in the
world, struck terror in all neighbouring states and kingdoms;
threatening destruction to them, and obliging them to submit to their
tyranny and exactions. Jarchi interprets this of the land of Israel; and
the Jewish writers commonly understand by the land of the living the
land of Canaan wherever they meet with it; because here men worshipped
the living God, and lived before him; and the inhabitants of this land
were often terrified by the king of Assyria. So the Targum,

"because they ruled in the land of Israel.''

[Ezekiel 32:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 32:24</span></span>

There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave,.... The
kingdom of the Medes and Persians lying in ruin, and the potent kings
thereof in the state of the dead; with their army, as the Arabic
version, slain and destroyed, and placed round about the grave of the
king of Persia; for of him rather it is to be understood than of the
king of Assyria, or of Egypt, as some:

all of them slain, fallen by the sword; either of the Scythians in the
reign of Cyaxares; or of Nebuchadnezzar a few years before this, in the
reign of Zedekiah king of Judah; see [Jer
49:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#034.md),

which are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth;
unholy persons, profane sinners, destitute of the grace of God; who were
gone down into the grave, and even into hell and everlasting
destruction, as their sins deserved:

which caused their terror in the land of the living; made a great noise
in the world, and struck a panic in neighbouring nations, invaded and
conquered by them; this they did while living, but now, being in the
state of the dead, nothing was to be feared from them: yet have they
borne their shame with them that go down to the pit; were obliged to
submit to death, and a shameful one, by the hands of their conquerors,
and to be laid with ignominy in the grave with others, without any mark
of distinction; all being upon a level, cast into the same pit of
destruction, and into the lower parts of it; though their king might
have a magnificent sepulchre erected for him, as follows:

[Ezekiel 32:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 32:25</span></span>

They have set her bed in the midst of the slain, with all her
multitude,.... The grave is called a bed, [Isa
57:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#002.md), whereon is put the sepulchral
chest or coffin, in which the body is laid, and rests as on a bed. It
may here design a stately sepulchre or coffin in it, with a magnificent
monument over it for the king of Elam, with his army, and the generals
of it slain in battle, placed all around him, in less stately beds,
coffins, and graves, as explained in the next clause:

her graves are round about him; the king of Persia and his grave,
surrounded with the graves of his soldiers and officers:

all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword: though their terror was
caused in the land of the living, yet have they borne their shame with
them that go down to the pit; which is repeated for the confirmation of
it:

he is put in the midst of them that be slain; the king of Elam or
Persia; he is laid among the slain, having fallen with them, and his
grave is placed in the midst of them.

[Ezekiel 32:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eze 32:26</span></span>

There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude,.... The Scythians, a
powerful and warlike people; and all their armies, as the Targum; with
their leaders, generals, and commanders, as lying in their graves next
to the Assyrians and Elamites, or

her graves are round about him; not the king of Egypt, nor the king of
Assyria, nor the king of Persia; but the chief commander of the
Scythians, called the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, [Eze
38:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#002.md),

all of them slain by the sword; of Halyattes, king of Lydia, and
Cyaxares, king of Media, who was assisted by the former in subduing the
Scythians:

though they caused their terror in the land of the living; as they did
in Media, and other countries, and especially in some parts of Asia.

[Ezekiel 32:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eze 32:27</span></span>

And they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the
uncircumcised,.... That is, shall not lie in such state, or be buried
with such pomp and magnificence, and have such sepulchral monuments
erected to their memory, as other heroes among the Heathens have had;
such as the mighty kings of Assyria and Persia before mentioned:

which are gone down to hell, or "the grave",

with their weapons of war; which were never taken from them, and which
they held in their hands to the last, being never conquered, and died at
last a natural death, and not by the sword; or which were carried in
state before their hearse at the time of interment, as is the custom to
this day so to do at the funeral of great warriors, generals, and
officers:

and they have laid their swords under their heads; as a sign and token,
as Jarchi says, that the sword did not rule over them, that they did not
fall by it; either their statues and sepulchral monuments were adorned
with these, and other instruments of war, as was the grave of Misenus by
Aeneas (d); and as is still the custom where the heads of such mighty
ones are laid, to engrave them on them: or, literally, their swords and
other weapons of war were put in their graves under their heads; as it
was usual, in former times, in some places to put swords, shields, and
other armour, in the graves of military men, as were in the grave of
Theseus, on the bier of Alexander the great, and others, as reported by
Plutarch, Diodorus Siculus, and Sophocles (e): now the Scythians were
not buried: after this grand and pompous manner:

but their iniquities shall be upon their bones; or the punishment of
their sin should be, that their bones should lie unburied and scattered
about, or be dug up and broke to pieces, and treated with inhumanity and
contempt, as a just reward for their savageness, and cruelty:

though they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living: not
only the terror of the common people, but even of the most powerful
kings and mighty warriors.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">eze 32:28</span></span>

Yea, thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised,.... Kimchi,
and so others, think this is said to Pharaoh king of Egypt; but rather
it respects the prince of the Scythians, who should fall into the hands
of Heathens, and be destroyed by them:

and shalt lie with them that are slain with the sword; be buried with
them, or in like manner as they are; and not as mighty warriors, who die
a natural death in their own country, and are buried in a stately and
magnificent manner; but like those that fall by the sword of the enemy,
and are thrown into one common pit.

[Ezekiel 32:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">eze 32:29</span></span>

There is Edom, her kings, and all her princes,.... In the next place,
near the graves of the above mentioned, and in the same ruinous and
desolate condition, lie the famous kingdom of Idumea, and the several
kings and dukes of it, from the first setting of it up, to its last
destruction prophesied of, [Eze 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#012.md),
of many of which mention is made, [Gen
36:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#015.md),

which with their might are laid by them that are slain with the sword;
who, notwithstanding their powerful armies, and prowess and skill in
war, yet are conquered, and destroyed, and laid in graves in like manner
as all others slain by the, sword of the enemy are:

they shall lie with the uncircumcised; for though they themselves were
circumcised, being the descendants of Esau the son of Isaac, the son of
Abraham, on whose seed circumcision was enjoined; yet this did not
secure them from a violent death, and an ignominious burial; they being
uncircumcised in heart, wicked and ungodly men, and so should be joined
in their death and burial with such:

and with them that go down to the pit; the common receptacle of the
slain.

[Ezekiel 32:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">eze 32:30</span></span>

There be the princes of the north,..... The kings of Babylon, according
to Kimchi, which lay north of Judea; or the princes of Syria, Damascus,
and Tyre, especially the latter, which commonly goes along with Zidon,
being near it, as follows:

and all the Zidonians. The Vulgate Latin version renders it, "and all
the hunters"; but wrongly; as also the Septuagint and Arabic versions,
which read the princes or soldiers of Assyria. The Zidonians or
inhabitants of Zidon are meant as the Targum; a famous maritime city, as
Tyre also was, in Phoenicia:

which are gone down with the slain; into the grave, being conquered and
destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar; see [Eze
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#021.md),

with their terror they are ashamed of their might, the number and
strength of their armies, the valour and courage of their soldiers, and
the fortifications of their cities, in which they trusted, and of which
they boasted; but yet could not preserve them from ruin:

and they lie uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword; in
common with other profane and wicked persons that have fallen by the
sword as they have done:

and bear their shame with them that go down to the pit; See Gill on [Eze
32:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#024.md).

[Ezekiel 32:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">eze 32:31</span></span>

Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over his multitude,....
That is, when Pharaoh is brought to the grave, and into the state of the
dead, he shall look about him, and see who lie by him; and he shall
behold the above mentioned kings of Assyria, Persia, Idumea, and the
princes of Tyre and Zidon, and all their mighty armies, generals and
soldiers, in the same condition with himself; and this shall be some
solace to him in his own death, and at the loss of so great a kingdom,
such numerous subjects, and a vast army, that others as rich, as
powerful as himself, lie in the same low and miserable condition; though
such comfort as this must be poor comfort indeed! and yet this is all
the comfort wicked men have in hell, that they have company with them
there:

even Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword. Pharaohhophra and his
numerous army slain by the sword of the king of Babylon. This explains
who is meant by Pharaoh and his multitude: and that this would certainly
be his case it is added,

saith the Lord God; he hath spoken it, and it shall be done; whose words
are continued in the next verse.

[Ezekiel 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">eze 32:32</span></span>

For I have caused my terror in the land of the living,.... Or, "his
terror" (f); there is a double reading. The Keri or marginal reading,
which we follow has it "my terror" (g); but the Cetib or writing is his
terror; and so read the Septuagint. Syriac, and Arabic versions; both
may be taken, and the sense be, I have caused or suffered him, Pharaoh
king of Egypt, to be a terror to the nations about him, particularly to
the land of Israel, which the Targum expressly mentions as the land of
the living; and now I will terrify him who has terrified others:

and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with those that
are slain with the sword; shall have a common burial with other Heathen
nations; even with such, who, in a way of judgment, have perished by the
sword of their victorious enemies, as he will:

even Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord God; the king of
Egypt, his subjects, and his soldiers, as numerous as they are; and thus
ends this doleful ditty, and funeral dirge or lamentation, composed,
taken up, and sung for Pharaoh as ordered, thereby to assure him of his
certain destruction.
