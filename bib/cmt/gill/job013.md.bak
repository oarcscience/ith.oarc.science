INTRODUCTION TO JOB 13

Job begins this chapter by observing the extensiveness of his knowledge,
as appeared from his preceding discourse, by which it was evident he was
not less knowing than his friends, [Job
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#001.md); and therefore would have nothing
to do with them as judges in his cause, but would appeal to God, and
debate the matter before him, and leave it to his decision, since he
could expect no good from them, [Job
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#003.md); and all the favour he entreats
of them is, that they would for the future be no longer speakers, but
hearers, [Job 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#005.md); he expostulates
with them about their wicked and deceitful way of pleading for God, and
against him, [Job 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#007.md); and in order
to strike an awe upon them, suggests to them, that they were liable to
the divine scrutiny; that God was not to be mocked by them, that he
would surely reprove them for their respect of persons, and desires them
to consider his dreadful majesty, and what frail creatures they were,
[Job 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#009.md); then he expresses his
confidence in God, that he should be saved by him, notwithstanding the
afflictive circumstances he was in, [Job
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#014.md); and doubted not he should be
able so to plead his cause, as that he should be justified, if God would
but withdraw his hand, and take off his dread from him, [Job
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#018.md); he desires to know what his
sins were, that he should hide his face from him, and treat him with so
much severity, who was but a poor, weak, feeble creature, [Job
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#024.md); and concludes with a complaint
of the bitterness and sharpness of his afflictions, with which he was
consumed, [Job 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#026.md).

[Job 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 13:1</span></span>

Lo, mine eye hath seen all this,.... Or "all those things" (h) he had
been discoursing of, concerning the wisdom and power of God, and his
friends also; some of these he had seen instances of, he had been an
eyewitness of them, and could give an ocular testimony to them; and
others he had discerned with the eyes of his understanding, being opened
and enlightened, and had a clear and distinct view of them, so that he
had seen and knew as much of these things as any of them had. Some (i)
interpret it "all" other things, pertaining to the same subject; by what
he had said, it might be concluded he knew more; this was but a sample
or specimen of his knowledge, which, when observed, it might be
perceived what an understanding he had in such divine things: the words
are indeed absolute, "my eye hath seen all things" (k), which must not
be taken in the largest and comprehensive sense of all things to be
seen, heard, and understood; for though Job's knowledge was very great,
yet it did not take so great a compass as this; many things in nature
his eye had not seen, others in providence he could not discern, and but
a small portion of God, of his nature, perfections, ways, and works, was
known by him, as he himself confesses elsewhere, [Job
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#014.md); this therefore must be limited
and restrained to the subject matter in hand, and to what he and his
friends had been treating of:

mine ear hath heard; some things he had knowledge of by the report of
others, from his forefathers, his ancestors, men of capacity and
probity, that could be credited, and safely depended on, and even some
things by revelation from God; for if Eliphaz his friend had an heavenly
vision, and a divine revelation, which his ear received a little of, why
may it not be thought that Job also was sometimes favoured with visions
and revelations from God, whereby he became more intimately acquainted
with divine and spiritual things?

and understood it; that is, what he had seen and heard; some things may
be seen, and yet not known what they are; and other things may be heard,
and not understood; but Job had an understanding of what he had seen
with his own eyes, or had received by revelation, human or divine: and
all this is introduced with a "lo" or "behold"; not as a note of
admiration at his knowledge, though the things known by him were
wonderful, but as a note of attention to them, and to his remark on
them, and as expressive of the certainty of his sight, hearing, and
understanding of these things.

[Job 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 13:2</span></span>

What ye know, the same do I know also,.... Concerning God and his
perfections, his sovereignty, holiness, justice, wisdom, power,
goodness, &c. and concerning his providences, and his dealings with men
in an ordinary or in an extraordinary way:

I am not inferior unto you; as might be deduced from the preceding
discourse; See Gill on [Job 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#003.md).

[Job 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 13:3</span></span>

Surely I would speak to the Almighty,.... Or "therefore I would speak"
(l), since he knew as much as his friends, and they knew no more than
he, if so much, he would have no more to do with them, they should not
be his judges; nor would he be determined by them, but would appeal to
God, and plead his own cause before him, by whom he doubted not he
should be candidly heard; he knew that he was the Judge of all the
earth, and would do right; and that he sat on a throne judging
righteously, and would maintain his right and his cause; that he would
judge him according to his righteousness and integrity, of which he was
conscious, and would pass a just decisive sentence in his favour, and
give the cause for him against his friends, as he afterwards did; for
this is not to be understood of speaking to him in prayer, though that
is a speech either of the heart or of the tongue, or of both, to God;
and which he allows of, yea, delights in, and which is a wonderful
condescension; and therefore it may be used with boldness and freedom,
and which gracious souls are desirous of; and the consideration of God
being "almighty", or "all sufficient", is an argument, motive, and
inducement to them to speak or pray unto him, since he is able to do all
things for them they want or desire of him; but here it is to be
understood of speaking to him, or before him, in a judicial way, at his
bar, before his tribunal, he sitting as a Judge to hear the cause, and
decide the controversy between Job and his friends. So, he render it, "I
would speak for the Almighty, and desire to reason for God" (m); seeing
he knew so much of him; not speak against him, as his friends suggested
he had, but for him, on behalf of his sovereignty, justice, holiness,
wisdom, and strength, as he had done, and would do yet more; by which he
would have it known, that as he had as much knowledge as they, he was as
zealous as any of them to plead for God, and defend him, and promote his
honour and glory to the uttermost; but the other sense is best:

and I desire to reason with God: not at the bar of his justice, with
respect to the justification of his person by his own righteousness; so
no man can reason with God, as to approve himself just with him; nor
will any sensible man desire to enter into judgment with him on that
foot; a poor sensible sinner may reason with God at the throne of grace,
and plead for pardoning mercy and justifying grace through the blood and
righteousness of Christ, and from the declarations, proclamations, and
promises of grace through him; but of neither of these sorts of
reasoning, are the words to be understood, but of debating the matter in
controversy between Job and his friends before God, that he might hear
it, and decide it; this was what Job was desirous of, of having the
cause brought before him, the case stated and pleaded, and reasoned on
in his presence; this he signifies would be a pleasure to him; he
"should delight" to have it so, as the word (n) here used may be
interpreted.

[Job 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 13:4</span></span>

But ye are forgers of lies,.... This is a hard and very harsh saying;
Job was now in a passion, provoked by his friends, and retorts upon them
what they had charged him with, [Job
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#003.md); so often in controversies and
disputes between good men undue heats arise, and unbecoming words drop
from their lips and pens; to tell lies is a bad thing, but to forge
them, to tell a studied premeditated lie, is dreadfully shocking,
contrary to the grace of God, and which good men cannot allow themselves
in, it is the character of bad men, see [Isa
63:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#008.md); but it may be Job may not design
lies in a strict and proper sense, but falsehoods and untruths; for
though no lie is of the truth, yet every untruth is not a lie; because a
man may deliver an untruth, not knowing it to be so, but taking it for a
truth, speaks it, without any design to impose upon and deceive others.
Doctrinal lies may be intended, such as the false prophets told, whereby
they made the hearts of the righteous sad, and were the untempered
mortar they daubed with, [Eze 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#010.md);
and the word here used has the same signification, and may be rendered,
"daubers of lies" (o); that colour over things, and make falsehoods look
like truths, and deliver them for such, and like others speak lies in
hypocrisy: now those here referred to were these, that God did not
afflict good men, at least in any very severe manner, and that Job,
being thus afflicted, was a bad man, and an hypocrite; both these Job
charges as lies:

ye are all physicians of no value; or "idol physicians" (p); not that
pretended to the cure of idols, but were no better than idols
themselves, and understood no more how to cure than they, than an
Heathen deity, the god of physic Aesculapius, or anyone that might be
reckoned such; but was no other than an image of wood or stone, and so
could not be possessed of the faculty of healing, and such were Job's
friends; an idol is nothing, and is good for nothing, and such were they
as physicians, they were idol physicians, like the "idol shepherd", [Zac
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#017.md); of no value at all: the Rabbins
(q) say, the word used signifies a nerve or sinew of the neck, which
when broken is incurable; and such physicians were they, that could do
him no service, no more than cure a broken neck; this is to be
understood of them, not as physicians of his body, that they pretended
not to be; he was greatly diseased from head to foot, and had no hope of
a recovery of his health, nor did they pretend to prescribe for him, nor
does he reproach them on that account; but as physicians of his soul,
afflicted and distressed, they came to administer comfort to him under
his afflictions, but they were miserable comforters, as he elsewhere
calls them, [Job 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#002.md); instead of
acting the part of the good Samaritan, and pouring in oil and wine into
his wounds, [Luk 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#034.md), they poured in
vinegar, and made them bleed and smart the more, and added affliction to
his affliction; instead of healing, they wounded him yet more and more;
and, instead of binding up his wounds, opened them wider, and gave him
sensible pain; instead of giving him the cordials of the Gospel, they
gave him the corrosives the law; and instead of pointing out unto him
the gracious promises of God, for the support of his afflicted soul,
they loaded him with charges of sin, and set him to work by repentance
and reformation to obtain the forgiveness of them: they said many good
things, but misapplied them, being ignorant of the case, and so were
physicians of no value; as such are who are ignorant of the nature and
causes of a disease, and therefore make wrong prescriptions, though the
medicines they prescribe may in themselves be good: indeed, in the cases
of souls, or for the healing of the diseases of the soul, which are
natural and hereditary, epidemical and universal, nauseous and
loathsome, and of themselves mortal, all physicians are of no value; but
Jesus Christ, who is the only physician of souls, the able, skilful, and
infallible one, that cures all fully freely that apply unto him; bodily
physicians are no use in such cases, nor merry companions, nor legal
preachers, who direct to supple the wounds with tears of repentance, and
bind them up with rags of a man's own righteousness; Christ is the only
Saviour, his blood the balsam that heals every wound, and his
righteousness that affords peace, joy, and comfort to afflicted minds,
and delivers from those weights and pressures of mind with which they
are bowed down.

[Job 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 13:5</span></span>

And that ye would altogether hold your peace,.... Since what they said
of him was not true, nor anything to the purpose, or that tended to the
comfort of his afflicted soul, but the reverse; and therefore he could
have wished they had never broke silence, but continued as they were the
first seven days of their visit; and now, since they had spoken, and had
done no good by speaking, but hurt, he desires for the future they would
be silent, and say no more:

and it should be your wisdom: it would be the greatest evidence of it
they could give; they had shown none by speaking; it would be a proof of
some in them, should they hold their peace; a very biting expression
this see [Pro 17:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#028.md).

[Job 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 13:6</span></span>

Hear now my reasoning,.... Job entreats his friends that they would be
no longer speakers, but hearers; that they would vouchsafe to sit still,
and hear what he had to say; though he was greatly afflicted, he had not
lost his reason, wisdom was not driven out from him, [Job
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#013.md); he had still with him his
reasoning powers, which he was capable of making use of, and even before
God, and desires that they would attend to what he had to say on his own
behalf:

and hearken to the pleadings of my lips; he was capable of pleading his
own cause, and he was desirous of doing it before God as his Judge; and
begs the favour of his friends to be silent, and hear him out, and then
let judgment be given, not by them, but by God himself.

[Job 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 13:7</span></span>

Will you speak wickedly for God?.... As he suggests they did; they spoke
for God, and pleaded for the honour of his justice, by asserting he did
not afflict good men, which they thought was contrary to his justice;
but: then, at the same time, they spoke wickedly of Job, that he being
afflicted of God was a bad man, and an hypocrite; and this was speaking
wickedly for God, to vindicate his justice at the expense of his
character, which there was no need to do; and showed that they were poor
advocates for God, since they might have vindicated the honour of his
justice, and yet allowed that he afflicted good men, and that Job was
such an one:

and talk deceitfully for him? or tell lies for him, namely, those just
mentioned, that only wicked men, and not good men, were afflicted by
him, and that Job was a bad man, and an hypocrite.

[Job 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 13:8</span></span>

Will ye accept his person?.... Accepting persons ought not to be done in
judgment by earthly judges; which is done when they give a cause to one
through favour and affection to his person, because rich, or their
friend, and against another, because otherwise; and something like this
Job intimates his friends did in the present case; they only considered
what God was, holy, just, wise, and good in all he did, and so far they
were right, and too much respect cannot be given him; but the fault was,
that they only attended to this, and did not look into the cause of Job
itself, but wholly neglected it, and gave it against him, he being poor,
abject, and miserable, on the above consideration of the perfections of
God; which looked like what is called among men acceptation, or respect
of persons:

will ye contend for God? it is right to contend for God, for the being
of God against atheists, for the perfections of God, his sovereignty,
his omniscience, omnipresence, &c. against those that deny them, for his
truths and doctrines, word, worship, and ordinances, against the
corrupters of them; but then he and those are not to be contended for in
a foolish and imprudent manner, or with a zeal, not according to
knowledge, much less with an hypocritical one, as was Jehu's, [Kg2
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#028.md); God needs no such advocates, he
can plead his own cause, or make use of persons that can do it in a
better manner, and to better purpose.

[Job 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 13:9</span></span>

Is it good that he should search you out?.... That is, God; searching is
ascribed to him after the manner of men; not that he is ignorant of
persons or things he searches after, or exercises that application,
diligence, and industry, and takes those pains which are necessary in
men to find out anything; when he makes search, it is not on his own
account, but others; at least it is only to show his knowledge of
persons and things, and to make men known to others, or things to them
themselves; and is here to be understood in a judicial sense, as it
frequently is the case, so it was here, a man that is "first in his own
cause", as the wise man says, [Pro
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#017.md), "seemeth just"; to himself and
others; it looks upon the representation he makes of things as if he was
in the right: "but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him"; traverses
his arguments in his own vindication, and shows the fallacy of them; so
Job's friends, making the worst of his cause, and the best of their own,
seemed right in their own eyes; but God, who is the searcher of hearts,
and who knows all things, could see through their coverings of things,
and could not be deceived by them, but would find them out, and expose
them; as he did afterwards, when he gave judgment against them, and
declared they had not said that which was right, as his servant Job had,
[Job 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#007.md); and therefore it was not to
their profit and advantage, and to their honour and credit, to be
searched out by him, or to run the risk of it, as they did, which is the
amount of this question:

or as one mocketh another, do ye so mock him? men may be mocked by their
fellow creatures, either by words or gestures, as good men usually are
in all ages, especially the prophets of the Lord, and the ministers of
his word; or they may he deceived and imposed upon by the false glosses
and colourings of artful men, as simple men are deceived by the fair
speeches of false teachers, which is no other than an illusion of them,
or mocking them: in the first sense God may be mocked, though he should
not; there have been and will be such bold and daring creatures as to
mock at his promises and his providence, to mock at his word,
ordinances, and ministers, which is interpreted by him a mocking and
despising himself; but in the latter sense he cannot be mocked, and it
is a vain thing to attempt it; "be not deceived, God is not mocked",
[Gal 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#007.md); he sees through all the
fallacious reasonings of men; he judges not according to outward
appearance; he sees and knows the heart, and all the views and designs
of men, and can detect all their sophisms and false glosses; he is not
to be deceived by specious pretences of doing such and such actions for
his glory, as casting out good men, and their names, or traducing their
characters that he may be glorified, or killing them to do him service,
[Isa 66:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#005.md); he is not to be flattered
as one man may flatter another; to do this with him, is to mock him, he
is not to be mocked in this way.

[Job 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 13:10</span></span>

He will surely reprove you,.... Or "in reproving he will reprove you"
(r); he will certainly do it, it may be depended upon, and be expected;
he will never suffer sin to go unreproved and uncorrected; he will do it
to the purpose, with sharpness and severity, as the nature of the crime
requires; he reproves by his spirit, and it is well for men when he
thoroughly, and in a spiritual and saving way, reproves them by him, and
convinces them of sin, righteousness, and judgment; and he reproves by
his word, which is written for reproof and correction; and by his
ministers, one part of whose work it is to rebuke and reprove men for
bad practices, and bad principles; and in some cases they are to use
sharpness, and which when submitted to, and kindly taken, it is well;
and sometimes he reproves by his providences, by afflictive
dispensations, and that either in love, as he rebukes his own children,
or in wrath and hot displeasure, as others, which is here designed; and
as it is always for sin he rebukes men, so particularly he rebukes for
the following, as might be expected:

if ye do secretly accept persons; acceptance of persons in judgment is
prohibited by God, and is highly resented by him; yea, even the
acceptance of his own person to the prejudice of the character of an
innocent man; which seems to be what Job has respect unto, as appears
from [Job 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#008.md); and some versions
render it, "if ye accept his face" (a); and though this may be done no
openly and publicly, but in a covert and secret manner, under disguise,
and with specious pretences to the honour and glory of God.

[Job 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 13:11</span></span>

Shall not his excellency make you afraid,.... To commit sin, any sin,
and particularly that just mentioned, which they might expect to be
reproved for; there is an excellency in the name of God, which is
fearful and dreadful, and in the nature and perfections of God, his
power, justice, and holiness, in which he is glorious and tremendous,
and should deter men from sinning against him; and there is an
excellency in his works of nature and providence, which are wondrous,
and show him to be near at hand, and can at once, if he pleases, take
vengeance for sin: or "shall not his height" (b), &c. his sublimity, his
superiority to all beings; he is the most high God, higher than the
highest among men, he is above all gods, all that are so called; and
therefore all the inhabitants of the earth should stand in awe of him,
and not sin: or "shall not his lifting up" (c)? &c. on a throne of
judgment, as the Targum adds; he is the Judge of the whole earth, and
will judge his people, and right their wrongs; he sits on a throne high,
and lifted up, judging righteously; and will maintain the cause of the
innocent, and avenge himself on those that injure them, and therefore it
must be a fearful thing to fall into his hands: some render it, "shall
not his burning" (d); or flaming fire, &c. as Jarchi observes, and apply
it to hell fire, and the everlasting burnings of the lake which burns
with fire and brimstone; and which are very terrible, and may well
frighten men from sinning against God; but the first sense seems to be
best:

and his dread fall upon you? the dread of men, of powerful and
victorious enemies, is very terrible, as was the dread of the Israelites
which fell upon the inhabitants of Canaan, [Jos
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#009.md); but how awful must be the terror
of the great and dreadful God, when that falls upon men, or his terrible
wrath and vengeance are revealed from heaven, and threaten every moment
to fall upon the transgressors of his law, upon those that mock him and
injure his people.

[Job 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 13:12</span></span>

Your remembrances are like unto ashes,.... Either of things they put Job
in remembrance of, the mementos which they had suggested to him; see
[Job 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#007.md); or the things which they had
brought forth out of their memories, the instances they had given of
what had been in the world, the arguments, objections, and reasonings,
they had made use of in this controversy; their "memorable sentences"
(e), as some render it, were of no more moment and importance than
ashes, and easily blown away like them; or whatsoever was memorable in
them, or they thought would perpetuate their memory hereafter, as their
houses and lands, and towns and cities, called by their names, these
memorials should perish, [Psa 49:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#011.md);
or their wealth and riches, their honour and glory, their learning,
wisdom, and knowledge, all should fade, and come to nothing; the memory
of the just indeed is blessed, the righteous are had in everlasting
remembrance, because of their everlasting righteousness; but as anything
else, that may be thought to be a remembrance of man, it is but as
ashes, of little worth, gone, and often trampled upon; and men should
remember that they are but dust and ashes, as Aben Ezra (f) observes,
even in their best estate, in comparison of the excellency of God,
before spoken of; and as Abraham confessed in the presence of God, [Gen
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#027.md);

your bodies to bodies of clay; that is, are like to bodies of clay, to
such as are made of clay after the similitude of human bodies; and such
are the bodies of men themselves, they are of the earth, earthly, they
are houses of clay, which have their foundation in the dust; earthen
vessels, and earthly houses of this tabernacle, poor, mean, frail,
brittle things, are crushed before the moth, and much more before the
Almighty; the word is by some rendered "eminencies", the most eminent
men; what is most eminent in them are like to "eminences of clay" (g),
or heaps of dirt: some interpret this, as the former expression, of
their words, reasonings, arguments, and objections; which though great
swelling words, were vain and empty, mere bubbles, and though reckoned
strong reasonings, unanswerable arguments, and objections, had no
strength in them, but were to be easily thrown down like hillocks of
clay; and though thought to be like shields, or high and strong
fortresses, as some (h) take the word to signify, yet are but clayey
ones.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 13:13</span></span>

Hold your peace, let me alone,.... Or, cease "from me" (i): from
speaking to me, or hindering me from speaking. Job might perceive, by
some motions of his friends, that they were about to interrupt him; and
therefore he desires they would be silent, and let him go on:

that I may speak; or, "and I will speak",

and let come on me what will; either from men, or from God himself; a
good man, when he knows his cause is good, and he has truth on his side,
is not careful or concerned what reproach may be cast upon him, or what
censures from men he may undergo; or what persecutions from them he may
endure; none of these things move him from his duty, or can stop his
mouth from speaking the truth; let him be threatened with what he will,
he cannot but speak the things which he has seen and heard, and knows to
be true; as for what may come upon him from God, that he is not
solicitous about; he knows he will lay nothing upon him but what is
common to men, will support him under it, or deliver him from it in his
own time and way, or however make all things work together for his good:
some render it, "and let something pass by me", or "from me" (k); that
is, somewhat of his grief and sorrow, while he was speaking and pouring
out his complaints before God; but the former sense seems best.

Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth,.... Or bite my lips, to keep
in my words, and refrain from speaking? I will not do it:

and put my life in my hand? or, expose it to danger by a forced silence;
when I am ready to burst, and must if I do not speak; I will not thus
endanger my life; it is unreasonable I should, I will speak my mind
freely and fully, that I may be refreshed; so Sephorno interprets it of
Job's putting his hand to his mouth, that he might be silent; and of
putting a forcible restraint upon himself, that he might not declare
what was upon his mind; see [Job
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#019.md); but others, as Bar Tzemach,
take the sense to be, what is the sin I have committed, that such sore
afflictions are laid upon me; that through the pain and distress I am
in, I am ready to tear off my flesh with my teeth, and my life is in the
utmost danger? and some think he was under a temptation to tear his own
flesh, and destroy himself; and therefore argues why he should be thus
hardly dealt with, as to be exposed to such a temptation, and thrown in
such despair, which yet he laboured against; but rather the meaning is,
in connection with the preceding verse, let whatsoever will come upon
me, "at all events, I will take my flesh in my teeth, and I will put my
life in my hand" (l); I will expose myself to the greatest dangers which
is the sense of the last phrase in [Jdg
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#003.md); come life, come death, I will
not fear; I am determined to speak out my mind let what will be the
consequence; and with this bold and heroic spirit agrees what follows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 13:15</span></span>

Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him,.... There is a double
reading of these words; the "Keri", or marginal reading, is "in him",
which we follow; the "Cetib", or textual reading, is "not", which many
follow, and render the words, "lo, he will slay me, I shall not hope";
or, "I have no hope", or "do not expect" (m) that is, any other than to
be slain or die; and this agrees with various expressions of his
elsewhere, that he had no hope of any long continuance of life, or of
restoration to health and outward happiness again, but expected to die
quickly; see [Job 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#011.md);

but I will maintain mine own ways before him; or "to his face" (n);
though I die on the spot instantly, I will stand by it, and make it
appear that the ways I have walked in are right, that I have behaved as
a sincere upright man, a man fearing God, and eschewing evil; a
character which God himself has given of me, and I have not forfeited
it: "I will argue" or "prove" (o) it before him, as it may be rendered;
that my life and conversation has been agreeable to my profession of
him; that my ways have been according to his revealed will, and my walk
as becoming the character I bear; and this I will maintain and support
as long as I live; I will never depart from this sentiment, or let go my
integrity to my latest breath; see [Job
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#005.md); but the marginal reading seems
best, "yet will I trust in him" (p)? verily I will, though I am under
cutting and slaying providences, under sore afflictions, which may be
called killing and slaying, or death itself; though there is an addition
of them, one affliction upon another, and sorrow upon sorrow; though I
am killed continually, all the day long, or die by inches; yea, though
in the article of death itself, yet even then "will I trust" and hope:
God only is the object of trust and confidence, and not a creature, or
any creature enjoyment, or creature act; and great encouragement there
is to trust in him, seeing in him is everlasting strength, to fulfil his
promises, to help in time of need, and to save with an everlasting
salvation; he is to be trusted in at all times, in times of affliction,
temptation, desertion, and death itself: it may be rendered (q), "I will
hope in him", since there is mercy and plenteous redemption with him,
and he delights in those that hope in his mercy; his eye is upon them,
and his heart is towards them: or "I will wait for him", or "expect him"
(r); wait for deliverance by him, wait all the days of his appointed
time, till his change come; wait for the hope of righteousness by faith,
expect all needful grace from him now, and eternal glory and happiness
hereafter: "but" notwithstanding his trust was alone in God for time and
eternity, yet, says he, "I will maintain mine own ways before him"; that
I am not an hypocrite, or have behaved as a bad man; but have acted
under the influence of grace, according to his mind and will revealed.

He also shall be my salvation,.... Job, though he asserted the integrity
of his heart and life, yet did not depend on his ways and works for
salvation, but only on the Lord himself; this is to be understood not of
temporal salvation, though God is the author of that, and it is only to
be had of him, yet Job had no hope concerning that; but of spiritual and
eternal salvation, which God the Father has contrived, determined, and
resolved on, and sent his Son to effect; which Christ being sent is the
author of by his obedience, sufferings, and death; and in him, and in
his name alone, is salvation; and every soul, sensible of the
insufficiency of himself and others to save him, will resolve, as Job
here, that he, and he only, shall be his Saviour, who is an able,
willing, and complete one; see [Hos
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#003.md); and the words are expressive of
faith of interest in him. Job knew him to be his Saviour, and living
Redeemer, and would acknowledge no other; but claim his interest in him,
now and hereafter, and which was his greatest support under all his
troubles; see [Job 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#026.md);

for an hypocrite shall not come before him; a hypocrite may come into
the house of God, and worship him externally, and seem to be very devout
and religious; and he shall come before the tribunal of God, and stand
at his bar, to be tried and judged; but he shall not continue in the
presence of God, nor enjoy his favour, or he shall not be able to make
his cause good before him; and indeed he does not care to have himself
examined by him, nor shall he be saved everlastingly, but undergo the
most severe punishment, [Mat 24:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#051.md).
Job here either has respect to his friends, whom he censures as
hypocrites, and retorts the charge upon they brought on him; or he has
reference to that charge, and by this means clears himself of it, since
there was nothing he was more desirous of than to refer his case to the
decision of the omniscient God, and righteous Judge; which if he was an
hypocrite he would never have done, since such can never stand so strict
and severe an examination.

Hear diligently my speech,.... Or, "in hearing hear" (s); meaning, not
only that his friends would attentively hear him, but continue to hear
him; that they would hear him out what he had to say further: upon his
expressing himself with so much faith and confidence in God, they might
rise up from their seats and be preparing to be gone, as not having
patience to hear a man talk so confidently, who they thought was a bad
man and an hypocrite; or they might attempt to interrupt him while
speaking, and therefore he desires they would be still, and patiently
and diligently hear what he had more to say:

and my declaration with your ears; that is, that they would listen to it
attentively, when he doubted not but he should make his case as clear as
the sun, and set it in such a point of view, as that it would appear
most plainly to be right, and he to be a just man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 13:18</span></span>

Behold now, I have ordered my cause,.... Or "judgment" (t); that is, he
had looked over his cause afresh, had reviewed the state of his case,
had considered it in every light, had drawn a plan of it, had digested
it in a proper manner, and had arranged his reasons and arguments in
vindication of himself in a regular form; and had them at hand, and
could readily and easily come at them on occasion, to vindicate himself;
and upon the whole could say, in the strongest, manner, and could draw
this conclusion,

I know that I shall be justified; which, though it may primarily respect
the case in dispute between him and his friends, and the charge of
wickedness and hypocrisy brought against him by them, from which he
doubted not he should upon a fair hearing be acquitted by God himself,
yet it may include his whole state of justification, God-ward, in which
he was and should continue; and so may respect, not only the
justification of his cause before men, as it was ordered and managed by
him, but also the justification of his person before God, of which he
had a full assurance; having ordered his cause aright, settled matters
well, and proceeded upon a good plan and foundation; which to do is not
to put justification upon the foot of purity of nature at first birth,
and a sober life and conversation from youth upward, and a perfection of
good works arrived unto, as imagined; nor upon a comparative
righteousness with respect to other men, even profane and ungodly
persons; nor, upon repentance, and sincere though imperfect obedience;
nor upon an external belief of evangelic truths, and a submission to
Gospel ordinances: but such order their cause well, and rightly conclude
their justification, who see and own themselves to be transgressors of
the law of God, behold and acknowledge their own righteousness to be
insufficient to justify them, view the righteousness of Christ revealed
in the Gospel, in its glory, excellency, and suitableness, and lay hold
upon it as their justifying righteousness; and observing that the word
of God declares, that those that believe in Christ are and shall be
justified, and finding in themselves that they do with the heart believe
in Christ for righteousness, hence they most comfortably and most
sensibly conclude that they are justified persons; for this knowledge is
of faith, and this faith the faith of assurance; it is not barely for a
man to know that there is righteousness in Christ, and justification by
it, but that there is righteousness in him for himself, and that he is
the Lord his righteousness; for the words may be rendered, "I know that
I am righteous"; or, "am justified" (u); justification is a past act in
the mind of God; it is present, as it terminates on the conscience of a
believer; it is future, as it will be notified at the day of judgment
before angels and men; see [Isa 45:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#025.md).

Who is he that will plead with me,.... Enter the lists with him; dispute
the point, and try the strength of his arguments he had to plead for his
own justification: thus Christ, the head of the church, and the surety
of his people, is represented as speaking when he had by his obedience
and sufferings made satisfaction for them, by bringing in an everlasting
righteousness, and was, as their public and federal head, justified and
acquitted, [Isa 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#004.md); and much the same
words are put into the mouth of a believer in him, and are expressed by
him, [Rom 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#033.md); who stands acquitted
from all charges that men or devils, friends or foes, the law or justice
of God, the devil and his own unbelieving heart, at any time, can bring
against him. Job, well knowing the uprightness of his heart and life,
the justness of his cause depending between him and his friends, boldly
challenges them to come forth, and try it with him; or rather he seems
desirous that God himself would take the case in hand, and plead with
him; he was ready to engage with him, and in the presence of his
friends, and in their hearing; and doubted not of being acquitted before
God, and at his bar; so satisfied was he of his own innocence as to the
things charged upon him:

for now, if I hold my peace, I shall give up the ghost; his sense seems
to be, that if he was not allowed to speak for himself, and plead his
cause, and have a hearing of it out, he could not live, he could not
contain himself, he must burst and die; nor could he live under such
charges and calumnies, he must die under the weight and pressure of
them; though some think that this not only expresses his eagerness and
impatience to have his cause tried fairly before God, but contains in it
an argument to hasten it, taken from the near approach of his death:
"for now", in a little time, "I shall be silent" (w); be in the silent
grave: "I shall expire"; or die; and then it will be too late; therefore
if any will plead with me, let them do it immediately, or I shall be
soon gone, and then it will be all over: or rather the sense is, I
challenge anyone to reason the matter, and dispute the point with me;
and I promise that, if the cause goes against me, "now will I be
silent"; I will not say one word more in my vindication: "I will die";
or submit to any death, or any sort of punishment, that shall be
pronounced upon me; I shall patiently endure it, and not complain of it,
or object to the execution of it; so Sephorno.

that though in modesty he does not mention him, yet he it is he has the
chief, if not the sole regard unto in [Job

the Almighty, and reason with God, and have nothing more to do with his
friends, [Job 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#003.md); but before any
pleadings begin on either side, he is desirous of settling and fixing
the terms and conditions of the dispute; he requests that two things
might be granted him, which are mentioned in [Job
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#021.md),

then will I not hide myself from thee; through fear or shame, but boldly
appear before God, and come up even to his seat, and plead with him face

Withdraw thine hand far from me,.... His afflicting hand, which pressed
him; this he desires might be removed, or otherwise he could not have
the command of himself, make use of his reasoning faculties, recollect
his arguments, and give them in their due force and strength; for
afflictions of body affect the soul and memory, understanding and
judgment; this is one of the things he would have agreed unto before the
dispute was entered on; the other follows:

and let not thy dread make me afraid; the terrors of his law, or the
dreadful apprehensions of his wrath; he desires to be freed from all
slavish fear of God, that now possessed his mind through the severity of
his dispensations towards him, behaving as if he was his enemy; or he
deprecates his appearance in any external visible way and manner, which
might be frightening to him, and so hinder freedom of speech in his own
defence; these two things are before requested, [Job
9:34](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#034.md); which should they be granted, he
proposes as follows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 13:22</span></span>

Then call thou, and I will answer,.... Either call him by name in open
court, and he would answer to it; or arraign him at the bar, and exhibit
charges against him, and he would make answer to them and clear himself;
his sense is, that if God would take upon him to be plaintiff, and
accuse and charge him with what he had to object to him, then he would
be defendant, and plead his own cause, and show that they did not of
right belong unto him:

or let me speak, and answer thou me: or he would be plaintiff, and put
queries concerning the afflictions he was exercised with, or the
severity of them, and the reason of such usage, and God be the
defendant, and give him an answer to them, that he might be no longer at
a loss as he was for such behaviour towards him: this is very boldly
said indeed, and seems to savour of irreverence towards God; and may be
one of those speeches for which he was blamed by Elihu, and by the Lord
himself; though no doubt he designed not to cast any contempt upon God,
nor to behave ill towards him; but in the agonies of his spirit, and
under the weight of his affliction, and to show the great sense he had
of his innocence, and his assurance of it, he speaks in this manner; not
doubting but, let him have what part he would in the debate, whether
that of plaintiff or defendant, he should carry the cause, and it would
go in his favour; and though he proposes it to God to be at his option
to choose which he would take, Job stays not for an answer, but takes
upon him to be plaintiff, as in the following words.

[Job 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 13:23</span></span>

How many are mine iniquities and sins? Whether of ignorance or
presumption, through mistake or wilfulness, voluntary or involuntary,
sins of omission or commission, secret or open, or of heart, lip, or
life; for by this heap of words he uses in this and the next clause he
means all sorts of sins, be they what they would; he desires to know
what they were, both with respect to quality and quantity, how great (i)
they were, what heinous and capital crimes he had been guilty of, that
such sore afflictions were laid upon him; and how many they were, as
they were suggested to be by his friends, and who indeed call them
infinite, [Job 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#005.md); and as they might
seem to be from the many afflictions endured by him, which were supposed
to be for sins; though, as Schultens observes, such an interrogation as
the force of a diminution and negation, as that of the Psalmist; "how
many are the days of thy servant?" [Psa
119:84](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#084.md); that is, how few are they? or
rather none at all; namely, of light and joy, of pleasure and comfort;
so Job represents by this his sins to be but few (k) in comparison of
what his friends surmised, or might be concluded from his afflictions;
and indeed none at all of a capital nature, and such as were of a deep
die, atrocious and enormous crimes; only such as were common to good
men, who all have their frailties, infirmities, and imperfections, there
being not a just man that does good and sins not: Job did not pretend to
be without sin, but he was not sensible of any notorious sin he could be
charged with, nor was he conscious of allowing himself in any known sin,
or of living and walking therein, which is inconsistent with the grace
of God; moreover, as he knew his interest in his living Redeemer and
surety, to whom, and not to himself, his sins and transgressions were
imputed; he might ask, "how many iniquities and sins are to me" (l)? as
the words may be literally rendered; that is, which are to be reckoned
to me, to be placed to my account? none at all; see [Co2
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019.md);

make me to know my transgression and my sin; not that he was ignorant of
sin, of the nature and demerit of it, as unregenerate men are, who know
not the plague of their own hearts, indwelling sin, internal lusts, nor
the exceeding sinfulness of sinful actions, nor the effect and
consequences of sin, pollution, guilt, the wrath of God, the curse of
the law, and eternal death; at least do not know it as to be affected
with a sense of it, to have a godly sorrow for it, repent of it, confess
it, and forsake it; such knowledge as this is from the spirit of God,
and which Job had; but his meaning is, that if he could not be charged
with many sins, as might seem to be the case, yet if there was but one
that could be produced, and was the reason of his being afflicted after
this manner, he desires to know what that was, that he might, upon
conviction of it, acknowledge it, repent of it, relinquish it, and guard
against it; he desires to have a copy of his indictment, that he might
know what he stood charged with, for what he was arraigned, condemned,
and punished, as it was thought he was; this he judged a reasonable
request, and necessary to be granted, that he might answer for himself.

Wherefore hidest thou thy face,.... Not from his cry, because of his
sore and grievous afflictions, as Bar Tzemach; nor from helping and
saving him from his troubles, as Sephorno; nor from looking on his right
ways, as Jarchi; but from his person, withdrawing the manifestation of
his face and favour; withholding the discoveries of his love; and
denying him the light of his countenance, and sensible communion with
him, and enjoyment of him, he had been indulged with; Job formerly had
seen the face of God, enjoyed his presence, and walked in fellowship
with him; but now he had withdrawn himself from him, and he knew not
where to find him; see [Job 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#002.md); a
greater blessing cannot be had than the gracious presence of God;
nothing gives more pleasure when enjoyed, and nothing more grievous to
good men when it is withheld; oftentimes sin is the cause of it, but not
always, as in this instance of Job; the end of the Lord in all his
afflictions, both inward and outward, was to try his patience, his
integrity, and faithfulness; but as Job was for the present ignorant of
it, he desires to know the reason of this the Lord's behaviour towards
him; as it is what all good men should do in the like circumstances,
nothing being more afflicting and distressing to them, and even
intolerable; see [Psa 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#011.md); some
think here is an allusion to the behaviour of judges towards such as
were condemned by them, they were prejudiced against, and would neither
hear nor see them; or to a rite and custom in former times, as Pineda
observes, when judges, at the time of pronouncing sentence on a
malefactor, used to draw a curtain between them; or to the covering of
the face of the criminal, see [Job
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#024.md);

and holdest me for thine enemy? Job had been an enemy to God, as all men
are in a state of nature, yea, enmity itself, as is shown by their
wicked works; but he was now reconciled unto God, the enmity of his
heart was slain, and he had laid down his weapons of rebellion, and
ceased committing hostilities against God, and was become subject to him
and to his law, through the power of efficacious grace; a principle of
love, which is the fruit of the spirit in regeneration, was implanted in
him; and he was a true and sincere lover of God, one that feared him,
and trusted in him; whose faith worked by love, and so appeared to be of
the right kind; and therefore, since he was conscious to himself that he
loved God with all his heart, loved his word, his ways, and worship, his
people and all that belonged to him, it was cutting and grievous to him
to be thought and accounted, or deal with, as an enemy to him; for so he
interpreted his conduct towards him; as he afflicted him, he took it to
be in anger and fury, and hot displeasure; and as he hid his face from
him, he supposed it was in great wrath, viewing him in this light as his
enemy.

Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro?.... A leaf that falls from a
tree in autumn, and withers and is rolled up, and driven about by the
wind, which it cannot resist, to which Job here compares himself; but it
is not to be understood of him with respect to his spiritual estate; for
being a good man, and one that trusted in the Lord, and made him his
hope, he was, as every good man is, like to a tree planted by rivers of
water, whose leaf withers not, but is always green, and does not fall
off, as is the case of carnal professors, who are compared to trees in
autumn, which cast their leaves and rotten fruit; see [Psa
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003.md); but in respect to his outward
estate, his frailty, weakness, and feebleness, especially as now under
the afflicting hand of God; see [Isa
64:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#006.md); so John the Baptist, on account
of his being a frail mortal man, a weak feeble creature, compares
himself to a reed shaken with the wind, [Mat
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#007.md); now to break such an one was to
add affliction to affliction, and which could not well be borne; and the
like is signified by the next clause,

and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble? which cannot stand before the
wind, or the force of devouring fire; this also respects not Job in his
spiritual estate, with regard to which he was not like to dry stubble or
chaff, to which wicked men are compared, [Psa
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#004.md); but to standing corn and wheat in
the full ear; and not only to green grass, which is flourishing, but to
palm trees, and cedar trees of the Lord, which are full of sap, to which
good men are like; but he describes him in his weak and afflicted state,
tossed to and fro like dry stubble; and no more able to contend and
grapple with an incensed God than dry stubble can withstand devouring
flames; this he says, partly to suggest that it was below the Divine
Being to set his strength against his weakness; as David said to Saul,
"after whom is the king of Israel come out? after a dead dog, after a
flea?" [Sa1 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#014.md); which words Bar
Tzemach compares with these; and partly to move the divine pity and
commiseration towards him, who uses not to "break the bruised reed, nor
quench the smoking flax", [Isa 42:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#003.md).

[Job 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 13:26</span></span>

For thou writest bitter things against me,.... Meaning not sins and
rebellions, taken notice of by him, when his good deeds were omitted, as
Jarchi; sin is indeed an evil and a bitter thing in its own nature,
being exceeding sinful and abominable, and its effects and consequences;
being what provokes God to anger most bitterly, and makes bitter work
for repentance; as it did in Peter, who, when made sensible of it, wept
bitterly, [Mat 26:75](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#075.md); sooner or later,
sin, though it is a sweet morsel rolled about in the mouth for a while,
yet in the issue proves the gall of asps within, [Job
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#014.md), bitter and distressing; and
this God also puts down in the book of his remembrance, yea, writes it
as with a pen of iron, and with the point of a diamond, [Jer
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#001.md); but that cannot be meant here,
since Job was inquiring after his sins, asking what and how many they
were, and would not allow of any being committed by him that were
heinous and notorious; wherefore afflictions are rather here intended,
which are bitter and grievous, and not joyous, and especially such as
Job was afflicted with; see [Rut 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#020.md);
and these were written by the Lord in the book of his eternal purposes
and decrees, and were the things he performed, which were appointed for
Job, as he full well knew, and as all the afflictions of God's people
are; and besides they were written in a judiciary way, and so against
him; they were, as he apprehended, the sentence of a judge written down,
and read, and pronounced, and according to it inflicted, and that with
great deliberation as things are written, and in order to continue, as
what is written does; and so denotes that a severe decree was gone forth
against him, with design, and was and would be continued:

and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth; which had been
committed through weakness and ignorance; and which, it might have been
thought, would not have been taken notice of and animadverted on; or
rather which Job concluded had been forgiven and forgotten, according to
the tenor of the covenant of grace, and would never have been brought
into account any more; and yet these were not only remembered by the
Lord, at least seemingly, by the afflictions that were endured; but they
were by him brought to Job's remembrance, and the guilt of them charged
upon him, and stared him in the face, and loaded his conscience, and
filled him with reproach, and shame, as Ephraim, [Jer
31:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#019.md); and which is deprecated by the
Psalmist, [Psa 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#007.md); and what
aggravated this case and made it the more distressing was, that in Job's
apprehension it was to continue with him as an inheritance, as the word
(m) signifies, which abides with men in their families for ever; and
some respect may be had to the corruption of nature, which is
hereditary, and remains with men from their youth upwards.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">job 13:27</span></span>

Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks,.... Which is one kind of
punishment of offenders, and a preservation of them from making their
escape; and is a security and reservation of them for further punishment
sometimes; and so Job looked upon his afflictions as a punishment for he
knew not what, and with which he was so surrounded and enclosed, that
there was no getting out of them any more than a man can whose feet are
set fast in the stocks; and that he was here kept for greater
afflictions still, which he dreaded. Aben Ezra interprets it, "thou
puttest my feet in lime"; and this is followed by others (n),
suggesting, as a man's steps in lime are marked and easily discerned, so
were his by the Lord; but this seems to be foreign from the mind of Job,
who would not make such a concession as this, as if his steps taken
amiss were so visible:

and lookest narrowly into all my paths; so that there was no possibility
of escaping out of his troubles and afflictions; so strict a watch was
kept over him; see [Job 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#019.md);
according to Ben Gersom, this refers to the stocks, "it keeps all my
ways", kept him within from going abroad about the business of life, and
so may refer to the disease of his body, his boils and ulcers, which
kept him at home, and suffered him not to stir out of doors; but the
former sense is best:

thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet; either it, the stocks,
made a mark upon his heels, with which they were pressed hard, as
Gersom; or rather God set one upon them, afflicting him very sorely and
putting him to an excruciating pain, such as is felt by criminals when
heavy blows are laid upon the soles of their feet, to which the allusion
may be; or else the sense is, that he followed him closely by the heels,
that whenever he took a step, it was immediately marked, and observed by
the Lord, as if he trod in his steps, and set his own foot in the mark
that was left.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">job 13:28</span></span>

And he as a rotten thing consumeth,.... This by some Jewish writers (z)
is referred to and connected with the driven leaf and dry stubble Job
compares himself to, [Job 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#025.md); and
so the sense is, that his body, which, for its frailty and weakness, is
compared to such things, is like any rotten thing, a rotten tree, as Ben
Melech; or any thing else that is rotten, that is consuming and wasting
away, as Job's body was, being clothed with worms and clods of dust:

as a garment that is moth eaten; a woollen garment, which gathers dust,
out of which motifs arise; for dust, in wool and woollen garments
produces moths, as Aristotle (a) and Pliny (b) observe; and a garment
eaten by them, slowly, gradually, and insensibly, yet certainly, decays,
falls to pieces, becomes useless, and not to be recovered; such was
Job's body, labouring under the diseases it did, and was every day more
and more decaying, crumbling into dust, and just ready to drop into the
grave; so that there was no need, and it might seem cruel, to lay
greater and heavier afflictions on it: some interpreters make this "he"
to be God himself who sometimes is as rottenness and a moth to men, in
their persons, families, and estates; see [Hos
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#012.md).
