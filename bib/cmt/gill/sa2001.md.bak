### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001.md)

INTRODUCTION TO SECOND SAMUEL 1

This chapter contains an account of the death of Saul and Jonathan, as
related to David by an Amalekite, [Sa2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001.md); of the sorrow he and his men were
filled with at the news of it, [Sa2
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#011.md); of his order to put to death the
messenger that brought the tidings, for his concern in the death of
Saul, according to his own testimony, [Sa2
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#013.md); and of a lamentation composed by
David on this occasion, [Sa2 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#017.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 1:1</span></span>

Now it came to pass after the death of Saul,.... The third day after, as
appears from the next verse:

when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites; as related
in [Sa1 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#017.md),

and David had abode two days in Ziklag; which, though fired by the
Amalekites, was not utterly consumed, but there was still some
convenience for the lodging of David and his men; within this time he
sent his presents to several places in the tribe of Judah, of which
mention is made in the chapter before quoted, and at the same time it
was that so many mighty men came to him from several tribes spoken of in
[Ch1 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#001.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 1:2</span></span>

It came to pass on the third day,.... After the battle was fought, in
which Saul was slain:

that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul; that is, from them
who were in the camp with Saul, for he was dead. Some say (d) this was
Doeg the Edomite, which is not likely that he should come with such
tidings to David; besides, if he was Saul's armourbearer, as others say,
see [Sa1 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#004.md); he died with Saul; nor
his son, as others (e), which is not at all probable, though his being
an Edomite is no objection, since the Amalekites were of the race of
Edom:

with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: in token of mourning,
and was the bringer of bad tidings, see [Sa1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#012.md),

and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did
obeisance; as being the rising sun, Saul's successor, and now king.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 1:3</span></span>

And David said unto him, from whence comest thou?.... It is very likely
by his appearance and circumstances he suspected from whence he came:

and he said unto him, out of the camp of Israel am I escaped; which
plainly suggested that that was in danger, confusion, and distress.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa2 1:4</span></span>

And David said unto him, how went the matter? I pray thee, tell me,....
That is, how went the battle? on which side the victory?

and he answered, that the people are fled from the battle; meaning the
people of Israel, they had given way, and turned their backs upon their
enemies, and were fled:

and many of the people also are fallen and dead; fell by the sword in
the pursuit of them, and were not only wounded, but were slain, and
these great numbers of them:

and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also; which are mentioned last,
because they fell some of the last; and this part of the account is
reserved by the messenger to the last, because it was the article of the
greatest importance; the death of these two persons, the one the enemy,
and the other the friend of David, and the death of both made way for
his accession to the throne.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa2 1:5</span></span>

And David said unto the young man that told him,.... These tidings:

how knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead? this he
particularly inquired after, as what most affected him, and was most
material for him to know; and his meaning is, whether he had this of his
own sight and knowledge, or by report.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 1:6</span></span>

And the young man that told him,.... So it seems he was, and therefore
could not be Doeg, more likely his son of the two; but there is no
reason to believe he was either of them, who cannot be thought to be
well disposed to David:

said, as I happened by chance upon Mount Gilboa; who was either a
traveller that came that way just as the army was routed, and part had
fled to Gilboa; or if a soldier, was not one of those that attended
Saul, and was of his bodyguard, but happened on the flight to come to
the same spot on Gilboa where Saul was:

behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; that that might pierce him through
and die; but this seems not true, for he fell upon his sword for that
purpose, [Sa1 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#004.md),

and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him; the
charioteers and cavalry, of which part of the Philistine army consisted;
though this also does not agree with the account in the above place; for
according to that they were the archers that pressed him hard, and hit
him.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa2 1:7</span></span>

And when he looked behind him,.... To see how near the enemy was, and
who were pursuing him:

he saw me, and called unto me; by which it should rather seem that he
belonged to the Philistines than to the Israelites, and as his being an
Amalekite shows; for such an one would hardly be admitted among the
latter, though it is most likely he was with neither, but happened to
come that way just at that time:

and I answered, here am I; ready to hear what thou hast to say, and do
thy pleasure.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 1:8</span></span>

And he said unto me, who art thou?.... Being willing to know whether a
friend or an enemy, which by his coming behind him he could not tell:

and I answered him, I am an Amalekite: which he might be; but it is not
likely he should tell Saul he was, which would not recommend him to him;
though indeed he was now in such circumstances, that the Amalekites had
nothing to fear from him; and if he was slain by him, as Josephus (f)
affirms he was, it seems to be a just retaliation on him for sparing any
of that race, contrary to the will of God.

\(f\) Antiqu. l. 6. c. 14. sect. 7.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 1:9</span></span>

And he said unto me again, stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me,....
Which it can hardly be thought Saul would say; since he might as well
have died by the hands of the uncircumcised Philistines, which he
endeavoured to avoid, as by the hands of an Amalekite:

for anguish is come upon me; or trembling, as the Targum, not through
fear of death, but through fear of falling into the hands of the
Philistines, and of being ill used by them. Some render the words, "my
embroidered coat", or "breastplate", or "coat of mail", holds me (g), or
hinders me from being pierced through with the sword or spear; so Ben
Gersom (h):

because my life is yet whole in me: for though he had been wounded by
the archers, yet he did not apprehend he had received any mortal wound,
but his life was whole in him; and therefore feared he should fall into
their hands alive, and be ill treated by them.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa2 1:10</span></span>

So I stood upon him, and slew him,.... Pressed with all his weight upon
his body, that so the spear might pierce through him, and slay him; thus
he represents his death to be brought about:

because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen; this
is not consistent with what he had said before, both that he was leaning
on his spear, and not fallen to the ground, and that his life was whole
in him:

and I took the crown that was upon his head; which made him conspicuous,
and therefore the Philistines aimed at him, and pressed hard after him,
[Sa2 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#006.md); though some think that this
was not on his head, but carried into the field of battle, ready to be
put on if victory was on his side; and others say it was in the
possession and care of Doeg, who at his death gave it to his son to
carry to David, and thereby gain his favour:

and the bracelet that was on his arm; of gold no doubt, so Josephus (i);
such as great personages used to wear, men as well as women, see [Gen
38:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#018), especially military men (k.md).
Jarchi takes them to be the "totaphot" or phylacteries on the arm, which
is not probable:

and have brought them hither unto my lord; as ensigns of royalty, fit
only for a king, Saul's successor, as this person, by calling him lord,
owned him to be, and thought by bringing those to him to be highly he
neared and rewarded.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 1:11</span></span>

When David took hold on his clothes,.... Not on the young man's but his
own:

and rent them; on bearing of the death of Saul and Jonathan, see [Gen
37:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#034); from whence the Jews (l.md)
gather, that a man is bound to rend his clothes for a prince, and for
the father of the sanhedrim, since Saul, they say, was the prince, and
Jonathan the father of that court:

and likewise all the men that were with him; rent their clothes also, in
imitation of him; the same custom obtained among the Gentiles on
mournful occasions (m).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 1:12</span></span>

And they mourned and wept,.... Inwardly mourned, and outwardly wept, no
doubt sincerely:

and fasted until even; ate no food all that day until it was evening,
the manner in which fasts used to be kept:

for Saul, and for Jonathan his son; it is no wonder that David and his
men should mourn for Jonathan, a good man, and a valiant one, and a dear
and faithful friend of David's; but it may seem not so clear a thing
that they should, mourn for Saul, a wicked man, and a persecutor of
David without cause: but it should be observed that he had been
reconciled to David, and had not since attempted anything against him;
besides, he was his prince, his father-in-law, and the rather he might
be grieved for his death, and his men with him, because it was matter of
joy to the Philistines, and they would endeavour to avail themselves of
it; and especially the manner of his death, that he should be the cause
of it himself, and die without repentance, as it might be feared, and
quickly after consultation with a witch, and when left of God, if these
particulars were known to David:

and for the people of the Lord, and for the house of Israel; that is,
the people of the Lord, even the house of Israel, or who were of the
house of Israel; or if they are to be distinguished, the former may
respect the people of the Lord who died in battle, for whom mourning was
made; and the latter the people that survived, the whole kingdom of
Israel, which had sustained a great loss by the slaughter made in this
battle, as it follows:

because they were fallen by the sword; so many of them.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 1:13</span></span>

And David said unto the young man that told him, whence art thou?....
From what place, or of what people and nation art thou? though Abarbinel
thinks it neither respects place nor people, but that David thought he
was another man's servant; so that the sense of the question is, to what
man did he belong?

and he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite; he was not
any man's servant, but the son of a proselyte, of one that was by birth
and nation an Amalekite, but proselyted to the Jewish religion; he might
know of what nation he originally was, by the account he had given of
what passed between him and Saul, [Sa2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#008.md); though the mind of David might so
disturbed as not to advert to it; or if he did, he might be willing to
have it repeated for confirmation's sake.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 1:14</span></span>

And David said unto him, how, wast thou not afraid to stretch forth
thine hand,.... By which it should seem that he did more than stand upon
him, and press his body, that the spear might pierce through him, but
that he drew his sword, and slew him; so David understood him, and is
the sense of the phrase in [Sa1 17:51](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#051.md),

to destroy the Lord's anointed? a reason why David did not destroy him,
when it was in the power of his hands, and which he made use of to
dissuade others from it; and here charges it not only as a criminal, but
a daring action in this young man, at which he expresses his admiration
how he could do it; hereby representing it as a very shocking and
detestable action; see [Sa1 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#006.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa2 1:15</span></span>

And David called one of the young men,.... His servants that attended on
him:

and said, go near, and fall upon him; by smiting him with his sword:

and he smote him, that he died; his orders were instantly obeyed. Kings
and generals of armies had great power in those times and countries to
execute a man immediately, without any other judge or jury: what may
serve, or David might think would serve, to justify him in doing this,
is what follows.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 1:16</span></span>

And David said unto him, thy blood be upon thy head,.... The blood that
he had shed, let him suffer for it; for as he had shed blood, his blood
ought to be shed, according to the law of God; and for proof of this,
that he had so done, he appeals to his own confession:

for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the
Lord's anointed; and what might serve to confirm the truth of what he
had said were the crown and bracelet which he brought along with him;
and besides he was an Amalekite, of a nation that was devoted to
destruction; and, as Abarbinel thinks, David might suppose that he
killed Saul to take vengeance on him for what he had done to their
nation; but, after all, both he and Maimonides (n) allow the punishment
of him was not strictly according to law, but was a temporary decree, an
extraordinary case, and an act of royal authority; for in common cases a
man was not to be condemned and put to death upon his own confession,
since it is possible he may not be in his right mind (o); but David
chose to exercise severity in this case, partly to show his respect to
Saul, and to ingratiate himself into the favour of his friends, and
partly to deter men from attempting to assassinate princes, who himself
was now about to ascend the throne.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 1:17</span></span>

And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul, and over Jonathan
his son. Composed the following elegy on account of their death, and
sung it in a tune agreeable to it, he and the men that were with him.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 1:18</span></span>

(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow,....
These words, with what follow in this verse, are rightly put into a
parenthesis, since they do not begin nor make any part of the elegiac
song, or lamentation of David; and are here inserted to show, that,
amidst his sorrow and lamentation, he was not unmindful of the welfare
of the people, and to provide for their defence and security; and
therefore gave orders that care should be taken, especially in the tribe
of Judah, which was his own tribe, and where he had the greatest
authority, and for whom he might have the chiefest concern, that they
should be trained up in military exercises, learn the art of war, and
the use of every weapon of war, particularly of the bow, which, being a
principal one, may be put for all; and which may be the rather
mentioned, because the Philistines were expert in the use of it, and
seemed to have done much execution with it in the recent battle, see
[Sa1 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#003). They are said (p.md) to be the
inventors of it; though Pliny (q) ascribes it to others; and it may be
the people of Israel and of Judah had of late neglected to learn the use
of it, and to make use of it, and instead of that had taken to other
sort of arms in fighting; for that that was not unknown to them, or
wholly disused, is clear from this song, [Sa2
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#022.md); see also [Ch1
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#002.md). Moreover, as the Philistines,
especially the Cherethites, were expert in archery, David found ways and
means to get some of them afterwards into his service, and by whom he
might improve his people in the art, see [Sa2
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#018); though some (r.md) are of opinion
that the word "keshet", or bow, was the title of the following
lamentation or song, taken from the mention of Jonathan's bow in it;
which song the children of Judah were to be taught to sing; but then, as
has been observed by some, for this there would have been no need of the
following reference, since the whole this song is here recorded:

behold, it is written in book of Jasher); which the Targum calls the
book of the law; and Jarchi and Ben Gersom restrain it to the book of
Genesis, the book of the upright, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and suppose
respect is had to the prophecy concerning Judah, [Gen
49:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#008.md), but Kimchi, extending it to all
the five books of Moses, adds his blessing, in [Deu
33:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#007.md). In the Arabic version it is
explained of the book of Samuel, interpreted the book of songs, as if it
was a collection of songs; which favours the above sense. Jerom (s)
interprets it of the same book, the book of the righteous prophets,
Samuel, Gad, and Nathan: hut this book seems to have been a public
register or annals, in which were recorded memorable actions in any age,
and had its name from the uprightness and faithfulness in which it was
kept; and in this were set down the order of David for the teaching the
children of Judah the use of the bow, and perhaps the method which he
directed to for instruction in it; See Gill on [Jos
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#013.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa2 1:19</span></span>

The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places,.... The high
mountains of Gilboa, where Saul their king, and Jonathan his son, a
prince of the blood, and natural heir to the crown, and multitudes of
young men, the flower of the nation, were wounded and slain. Here begins
the lamentation, or the elegiac song:

how are the mighty fallen! mighty men of war, strong and valiant, as
Saul and his sons were, and the soldiers in his army.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa2 1:20</span></span>

Tell it not in Gath,.... One of the five principalities of the
Philistines, and the chief of them, being raised to a kingdom, and whose
king was at the head of the armies of the Philistines that engaged with
Saul. This is not to be understood of a command of David, who could not
hinder the victory the Philistines had got over Israel being known at
Gath, and talked of with pleasure there, but a wish it had not:

publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon; another of the principalities
of the Philistines, and the sense the same as before:

lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the
uncircumcised triumph; it being usual in those times and countries for
women, young women more especially, to express their joy, on occasion of
victories obtained, by singing and dancing, [Jdg
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#034.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa2 1:21</span></span>

Ye mountains of Gilboa,.... On which fell Saul and his sons, and many of
the people of Israel, [Sa2 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#006.md),

let there be no dew, neither let there be rain upon you; which is not to
understood as a real imprecation; for David would never curse any part
of the land of Israel, for which he had so great a regard; but only as a
poetical figure, expressing his concern for, and abhorrence of what
happened on those mountains; much less did this in reality take place,
as some have feigned, as if never dew nor rain descended on them (t)
afterwards; which has been refuted by travellers, particularly Borchard
(u), who, speaking of this mountain, says, that as he was upon it, there
was such a violent shower fell, that he was wet through his clothes; and
in the year 1273, laying all night upon this hill, there was a great dew
fell upon him:

nor fields of offerings; of heave offerings; the meaning is, that he
could wish almost that those hills were not fruitful, and that they
brought no fruit to perfection, so much as that heave offerings for the
service of the sanctuary might be taken; which is expressive of great
sterility and scarcity, see [Joe 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#013.md),

for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away; mighty men were
obliged to cast away their shields and flee, which were greatly to their
reproach and scandal, and to that of the whole nation: it was always
reckoned very scandalous, and a great crime, even punishable with death,
to cast away a shield, both with the Greeks and others (w): yea, also

the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil; as if
he was not the anointed king of Israel, but a common soldier: or else
this respects his shield, as if that was not anointed, as shields used
to be, that they might be smooth and glib, and missile weapons, as
arrows and others, might not pass through them, but slide off, see [Isa
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#005.md); though Gersom gives a different
turn, that Saul's shield being in continual use, needed not to be
anointed, as those did which for a time had been laid aside. Abarbinel
interprets these words thus, that he, who was the shield of the mighty,
even Saul himself, was vilely cast away, or become loathsome; and that
his shield was anointed, not with oil, but with the blood of the slain,
and the fat of the mighty, connecting them with the words following.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa2 1:22</span></span>

From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of
Jonathan turned not back,.... That is, it always did execution, the
arrows shot frown it pierced into men, shed their blood, and slew them;
even they entered into the fat of the mighty, or mighty ones, that were
fat, and brought them down; so the arrows of the Medes and Persians, the
expert men among them, are said not to return in vain, [Jer
50:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#009.md),

and the sword of Saul returned not empty; but was the means of slaying
many; though Abarbinel observes also that this may be interpreted of the
blood of the slain, and of the fat of the mighty men of Israel; and that
though Saul and Jonathan saw many of these fall before their eyes, yet
"for" or "because" of their blood, they were not intimidated and
restrained from fighting; the bow of the one, and the shield of the
other, turned not back on that account.

Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives,.... To one
another, had no quarrel or difference with each other, only on the
account of David; otherwise they agreed together in the court, and in
the camp, in their councils, and in their conduct:

and in their death they were not divided; neither from the people, nor
from one another; Jonathan stuck close by his father to the last; which
is observed to clear him from any imputation of conspiracy against him:

they were swifter than eagles; in the quick dispatch of business, in
hasting to the relief of the distressed, as Saul to the men of
Jabeshgilead, and in the pursuit of their enemies, as of the
Philistines, more than once:

they were stronger than lions; fighting with their enemies, who became
an case prey to them; and what is stronger than a lion among beasts?
[Jdg 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#018.md); or swifter than an eagle
among birds, which is said to cut the air with its wings (x)?

Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,.... In their mournful elegies:

who clothed you with scarlet, with other delights; not only with
scarlet, but with other fine and delightful apparel, such as were very
pleasing to the female sex, especially young people, who are delighted
with gay apparel; this Saul was the means of, through the spoil he took
from his enemies, and by other methods taken by him to the enriching of
the nation, whereby husbands and parents were enabled to provide rich
clothes for their wives and children:

who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel; broidered work, jewels
of gold, &c. See [Isa 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#018.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa2 1:25</span></span>

How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle!.... The mighty and
valiant men of war, the common soldiers as well as their general
officers, whose loss David mourns, and the repetition of shows how much
it affected him:

O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places; in the high places of
the land of Israel, the mountains of Gilboa, which though high, and in
his own country, could not protect him from his enemies, and from
falling by their hands: he who had been so valiant and victorious a
prince, and yet he fell, not in an enemy's country, but his own.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa2 1:26</span></span>

I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan,.... So he was, not only
by nation and religion, but by affinity, having married the sister of
Jonathan; and still more so by affection and friendship, he being a
friend of David's, that stuck closer to him than a brother, and who
loved him as his own soul; he was distressed for him, not on account of
his spiritual and eternal state, which he doubted not was happy, but for
the manner of his death, his loss of him, and want of his pleasant
conversation, of his counsel and advice, and assistance in his present
circumstances:

very pleasant hast thou been unto me; in their friendly visits of, and
conversation with, one another; many a pleasant hour had they spent
together, but now must see each other's faces no more in this world:

thy love to me was wonderful; as indeed he might well say, being towards
one of a mean extract in comparison of his, to one who was not his own
brother, but a brother-in-law; and to one that was a rival to the crown
he was heir to, and would take it before him: and who ran the risk of
losing his father's affection, and even his life, for espousing his
cause: see [Sa1 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#001.md),

passing the love of women; either that which they are loved with by men,
or that with which they love their husbands and children; which is
generally the strongest and most affectionate. The Targum is,"more than
the love of two women,''than his two wives, Ahinoam and Abigail; so
Kimchi; meaning that he was more strongly and affectionately loved by
Jonathan than by them, who yet might love him very well too.

How are the mighty fallen,.... This is the burden of this elegiac song,
being the third time it is mentioned:

and the weapons of war perished! not only the valiant soldiers were
killed, but their arms were lost; and particularly he may mean Saul and
Jonathan, who as they were the shields of the people, so they were the
true weapons and instruments of war, and with them all military glory
perished; which must be understood as a poetical figure, exaggerating
their military characters; otherwise David, and many mighty men with
him, remained, and who revived and increased the military glory of
Israel, as the following history shows.
