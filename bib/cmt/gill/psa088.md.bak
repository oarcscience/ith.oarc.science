[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 88:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO PSALM 88

A Song or Psalm for the sons of Korah, to the chief Musician upon
Mahalath Leannoth, Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite. Of the word "maalath",
See Gill on [Psa 53:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001.md). "Leannoth"
signifies "to answer". Perhaps this song was to be sung alternately, or
by responses. Both words are thought by some, as Aben Ezra, to be the
beginning of a song, to the tune of which this was set; and by others a
musical instrument, on which it was sung; a hollow one, as the word
"maalath" seems to signify, a wind instrument: others are of opinion
that they intend the subject matter of the psalm, and render them,
"concerning the disease to afflict", or "the afflicting disease" (a);
either a bodily one, which threatened with death, under which the
psalmist now was; or a soul disorder, being under desertions, and a
sense of divine wrath, which were very afflicting. The psalm is called
"Maschil", which may be translated "causing to understand"; it being
instructive to persons in a like case to apply to God, as he did; and if
it respects Christ, it teaches many things concerning him, his sorrows
and his sufferings: the author of it is said to be Heman the Ezrahite;
the Targum calls him Heman the native, and the Septuagint render it
Heman the Israelite, and Arama says this is Abraham. There were two of
this name, one the son of Zerah, the son of Judah, and so might be
called the Zerahite, and with the addition of a letter the Ezrahite; he
is mentioned along with others as famous for wisdom, [Ch1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#006.md), but this man seems to be too
early to be the penman of this psalm: though Dr. Lightfoot (b) is of
opinion that this psalm was penned by this Heman many years before the
birth of Moses; which and the following psalm are the oldest pieces of
writing the world has to show, being written by two men who felt and
groaned under the bondage and affliction of Egypt, which Heman here
deplores, and therefore entitles his elegy "Maalath Leannoth, concerning
sickness by affliction"; and accordingly he and his brethren are called
the sons of Mahali, [Kg1 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#031.md). There
was another Heman, who was both a singer in David's time, and the king's
seer, who seems most likely to be the person, [Ch1
6:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#033.md), he was when he wrote this psalm
under sore temptations, desertions, and dejections, though not in
downright despair; there is but one comfortable clause in it, and that
is the first of it; many interpreters, both ancient and modern, think he
is to be considered throughout as a type of Christ, with whom everything
in it more exactly agrees than with anyone man else. The Targum, Jarchi,
and Kimchi, interpret it of the people of Israel in captivity; and so
the Syriac version entitles it,

"concerning the people that were in Babylon;''

but a single person only is designed throughout. Spinosa (d) affirms,
from the testimony of Philo the Jew, that this psalm was published when
King Jehoiachin was a prisoner in Babylon, and the following psalm when
he was released: but this is not to be found in the true Philo, but in
Pseudo-Philo (d).

[Psalms 88:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 88:1</span></span>

O Lord God of my salvation,.... The author both of temporal and
spiritual salvation; see [Psa 18:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#046.md)
from the experience the psalmist had had of the Lord's working salvation
for him in times past, he is encouraged to hope that he would appear for
him, and help him out of his present distress; his faith was not so low,
but that amidst all his darkness and dejection he could look upon the
Lord as his God, and the God of salvation to him; so our Lord Jesus
Christ, when deserted by his Father, still called him his God, and
believed that he would help him, [Psa
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001.md).

I have cried day and night before thee, or "in the day I have cried, and
in the night before thee"; that is, as the Targum paraphrases it,

"in the night my prayer was before thee.''

prayer being expressed by crying shows the person to be in distress,
denotes the earnestness of it, and shows it to be vocal; and it being
both in the day and in the night, that it was without ceasing. The same
is said by Christ, [Psa 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#002.md) and is
true of him, who in the days of his flesh was frequent in prayer, and
especially in the night season, [Luk
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#012.md) and particularly his praying in
the garden the night he was betrayed may be here referred to, [Mat
26:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#038.md).

[Psalms 88:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 88:2</span></span>

Let my prayer come before thee,.... Not before men, as hypocrites
desire, but before the Lord; let it not be shut out, but be admitted;
and let it come with acceptance, as it does when it ascends before God,
out of the hands of the angel before the throne, perfumed with the much
incense of his mediation, [Rev 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003.md),

incline thine ear unto my cry; hearken to it, receive it, and give an
answer to it; Christ's prayers were attended with strong crying, and
were always received and heard, [Heb
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007.md).

[Psalms 88:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 88:3</span></span>

For my soul is full of troubles,.... Or "satiated or glutted" (e) with
them, as a stomach full of meat that can receive no more, to which the
allusion is; having been fed with the bread of adversity and the water
of affliction, so that he had his fill of trouble: every man is full of
trouble, of one kind or another, [Job
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#001.md) especially the saint, who besides
his outward troubles has inward ones, arising from indwelling sin, the
temptations of Satan, and divine desertions, which was now the case of
the psalmist: this may be truly applied to Christ, who himself said,
when in the garden, "my soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death",
[Mat 26:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#038.md), he was a man of sorrows
all his days, but especially at that time, and when upon the cross,
forsaken by his Father, and sustaining his wrath: "his soul" was then
"filled with evil things" (f), as the words may be rendered:

innumerable evils compassed him about, [Psa
40:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#012.md), the sins of his people, those
evil things, were imputed to him; the iniquity of them all was laid upon
him, as was also the evil of punishment for them; and then he found
trouble and sorrow enough:

and my life draweth nigh unto the grave: a phrase expressive of a
person's being just ready to die, [Job
33:22](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#022.md) as the psalmist now thought he
was, [Psa 88:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#005.md), it is in the plural
number "my lives" (g); and so may not only denote the danger he was in
of his natural life, but of his spiritual and eternal life, which he
might fear, being in darkness and desertion, would be lost, though they
could not; yea, that he was near to "hell" itself, for so the word (h)
may be rendered; for when the presence of God is withdrawn, and wrath
let into the conscience, a person in his own apprehension seems to be in
hell as it were, or near it; see [Jon
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#002.md). This was true of Christ, when he
was sorrowful unto death, and was brought to the dust of it, and under
divine dereliction, and a sense of the wrath of God, as the surety of
his people.

[Psalms 88:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 88:4</span></span>

I am counted with them that go down into the pit,.... With the dead,
with them that are worthy of death, with malefactors that are judicially
put to death, and are not laid in a common grave, but put into a pit
together: thus Christ was reckoned and accounted of by the Jews; the
sanhedrim counted him worthy of death; and the common people cried out
Crucify him; and they did crucify him between two malefactors; and so he
was numbered or counted with transgressors, and as one of them, [Isa
53:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#003.md).

I am as a man that hath no strength; for his "strength" was "dried up
like a potsherd", [Psa 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#015.md), though
he was the mighty God, and, as man, was made strong by the Lord for
himself.

[Psalms 88:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 88:5</span></span>

Free among the dead,.... If he was a freeman, it was only among the
dead, not among the living; if he was free of any city, it was of the
city of the dead; he looked upon himself as a dead man, as one belonging
to the state of the dead, who are free from all relations, and from all
business and labour, and removed from all company and society; he
thought himself quite neglected, of whom there was no more care and
notice taken than of a dead man:

like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more; in
a providential way, as in life, to clothe them, and feed them, and
protect and preserve them; in which sense God is said to be mindful of
men, [Psa 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#004.md), who when dead have no
need to be minded, and remembered in such a manner; otherwise God does
remember the dead, and takes care of their dust, and will raise them
again; and especially he remembers his own people, those that sleep in
Jesus, who will be thought of in the resurrection morn, and will be
raised first, and brought with Christ; see [Job
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#013.md),

and they are cut off from thy hand; that is, the slain that lie in the
grave, the dead that are buried there; these are cut off from the hand
of Providence, they needing no supplies from thence as in the time of
life. The Targum is,

"and they are separated from the face of thy majesty.''

or "they are cut off by thine hand" (i); by the immediate hand of God,
in a judicial way; so Christ in his death was like one of these, he was
cut off in a judicial way, not for his own sins, but for the
transgressions of his people, [Isa
53:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#008.md).

\(i\) "manu tua", Junius & Tremellius, Piscator, Amama.

[Psalms 88:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 88:6</span></span>

Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit,.... The Targum interprets it of

"captivity which was like unto the lowest pit;''

and so Jarchi and Kimchi. Some understand it of a prison or dungeon,
into which the psalmist was put; it may be interpreted of the pit of the
grave, into which Christ was laid; though he continued in it not so long
as to see corruption; from that prison and judgment he was quickly
taken, [Psa 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010.md), "in darkness"; both
corporeal and spiritual, [Mat 27:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#045.md),
and it is in the Hebrew text "in darknesses" (k), denoting both:

in the deeps; in the deep waters of affliction, sorrows, and sufferings;
see [Psa 69:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#001.md). The allusion is to a
dark and deep pit, under ground, such as in the eastern countries they
used to put their captives and prisoners into in the night, and take
them out in the morning; and which custom continues still among the
Turks. Leo Africanus (l) says he has seen three thousand Christian
captives together, clothed in a woollen sack, and chained to one
another; and in the night put into pits or ditches under ground; see
[Zac 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#011.md).

[Psalms 88:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 88:7</span></span>

The wrath lieth hard upon me,.... So some good men apprehend, when they
are under afflictive dispensations of Providence, and are left of God,
and have not his immediate presence, and the discoveries of his love;
though fury is not in him, nor does any wrath in reality fall upon them,
only it seems so to them; see [Psa
38:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#001.md), but the wrath of God did really
lie with all the effects of it upon Christ, as the surety of his people,
when he was made sin, and a curse for them; see [Psa
89:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#038.md),

and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves; the afflictions of God's
people are compared to waves and billows of the sea, which are many, and
come one upon the back of another, and threaten to overwhelm and sink;
see [Psa 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#007.md) and so the sufferings of
Christ are signified by waters coming into him, and floods overflowing
him; and hence they are called a baptism, [Psa
69:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#001.md), and these were brought upon him
by the Lord; he spared him not; he laid the whole chastisement, all the
punishment due to the sins of his people, on him; he caused every wave
to come upon him, and him to endure all sorrows and sufferings the law
and justice of God could require.

Selah. See Gill on [Psa 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#002.md).

[Psalms 88:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 88:8</span></span>

Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me,.... His familiar
friends, who were well known to him, and he to them: it is a mercy and
privilege to have good acquaintance, and hearty faithful friends, to
converse and advise with, whether about things civil or religious; and
it is an affliction to be deprived of them; and oftentimes in distress
and adversity they drop and fail, which is an additional trouble: this
was the ease of Job and of David, [Job
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#013.md) and here of Heman, who
attributes it to God, as done by him; as also Job does, in the place
referred to; for as it is the Lord that gives favour in the sight of
men, he can take it away when he pleases: this is true of Christ, and
the like is said of him, [Psa 69:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#008.md),
and by his "acquaintance", familiars, and friends, may be meant his
apostles, who, upon his being apprehended, forsook him, and fled; who,
though they were not all alienated in their affections, yet stood at a
distance from him; Peter, though he followed him, it was afar off, and
at last he denied him; and others of acquaintance and intimates stood
afar off, beholding was done to him on the cross; and his familiar
friend, Judas, lifted up his heel against him, and basely betrayed him,
[Mat 26:50](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#050.md),

thou hast made me an abomination unto them; to some of them, as to
Judas, and to many that hosanna'd him into Jerusalem, and within a few
days cried "Crucify him, crucify him", [Mat
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#009.md) compare with this [Isa
53:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#003.md).

I am shut up, and I cannot come forth; the Targum renders it,

"shut up in the house of prison,''

in a prison; and so some literally understand it of the author of the
psalm being in a prison, or dungeon, in the time of the captivity: but
it is rather to be understood of some bodily disease, by which he was
detained a prisoner at home, and of his being bound in fetters, and held
in the cords of affliction; which was as a prison to him, and in which
when the Lord "shuts up a man, there can be no opening", [Job
36:8](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#008.md), or else of soul troubles, being
in great darkness and desertion; so that his soul was as in a prison,
and could not come forth in the free exercise of grace, and needed the
free Spirit of God to set him at liberty; see [Psa
142:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#007.md), this may be applied to Christ,
when in the hands of Judas, and the hand of soldiers with him, who took
him, and bound him, and led him to the high priest; and when he was
encompassed with bulls of Bashan, and enclosed by the assembly of the
wicked, as he hung on the cross, [Psa
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#012.md).

[Psalms 88:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 88:9</span></span>

Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction,.... Or dropped tears, as the
Targum, by which grief was vented; see [Psa
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#007.md).

Lord, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto
thee; in prayer, as the Targum adds, this being a prayer gesture:
notwithstanding his troubles continued and increased, he did not leave
off praying, though he was not immediately heard and answered, which is
what is tacitly complained of, as in [Psa
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#002.md). Christ, in his troubles in the
garden, and on the cross, prayed for himself, for divine support and
assistance, as man; for his friends, disciples, and apostles, and for
all that should believe in him through them; and even for his enemies.

[Psalms 88:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 88:10</span></span>

Wilt thou show wonders to the dead?.... The Lord does show wonders to
some that are spiritually dead, dead in Adam, dead in law, dead in
trespasses and sins, by quickening them; whereby the wonders of his
grace and love, and of his power, and the exceeding greatness of it, are
displayed; for the conversion and quickening of a dead sinner is a
marvellous event, like that of; raising Lazarus from the dead, and
causing Ezekiel's dry bones to live: likewise the Lord will show wonders
to those that are corporeally dead, by raising them from the dead; which
work, though not incredible, yet is very wonderful, and can only be
accounted for by the attributes of Divine Omniscience and Omnipotence:
yea, he would, and he has shown wonders to Christ, when dead, by raising
him up again, and giving him glory, and that before he saw corruption,
and as the head and representative of his people; and by raising many of
the saints also, after his resurrection:

shall the dead arise and praise thee? the spiritually dead, when they
are made alive, and rise out of their graves of sin, praise the Lord for
the exertion of his grace and power upon them; which is one end of their
being formed anew, quickened, and converted; and those that are
corporeally dead, such of them as shall rise again to everlasting life,
their mouths will be filled with everlasting praise: but here the author
of the psalm suggests, that in a little time he should be among the
dead, unless he had speedy help and deliverance from his troubles; to
whom wonders are not shown, but to the living; and who ordinarily do not
rise again to this mortal state, to praise the Lord in it: or,
considering them as the words of Christ, he suggests, that none of the
above things would be done, unless he was a conqueror over death and the
grave, and was raised from thence himself; and so these expostulations
carry in them the nature of a prayer, even of the prayer of Christ, as
man, to be assisted in overcoming all his enemies, and to be raised from
the dead, as Cocceius and others think: the Greek and Vulgate Latin
versions are,

"shall physicians rise again?''

of whom the Jews had a bad opinion; See Gill on [Ch2
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#012.md).

Selah. See Gill on [Psa 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#002.md).

[Psalms 88:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 88:11</span></span>

Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave?.... Where he saw
himself now going, and where should he be detained, and not raised out
of it, the lovingkindness of God to him, as his Son, and as man and
Mediator, and to his people in the gift and mission of him to be their
Saviour and Redeemer, how would that be declared and made known? now it
is, Christ being raised, and his ministers having a commission from him
to preach the Gospel, in which the lovingkindness of God is abundantly
manifested:

or thy faithfulness in destruction? the grave, so called from dead
bodies being cast into it, and wasted, consumed, and destroyed in it:
the meaning may be, that should he be laid in the grave, and there
putrefy and rot, and not be raised again, where would be the
faithfulness of God to his purposes, to his covenant and promises, to
him his Son, and to his people?

[Psalms 88:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 88:12</span></span>

Shall thy wonders be known in the dark?.... A description of the grave
again; see [Job 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#021.md), The sense may
be, should he continue in the dark and silent grave, how would the
wonders of the grace of God, of electing, redeeming, justifying,
pardoning, and adopting grace, be made known; the wonders of Christ's
person and offices, and the wondrous things, and doctrines of the
Gospel, relating thereunto? as the glory of these would be eclipsed,
there would be none to publish them:

and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness? the grave, where the
dead lie, who, having lost all sense of things, forget what were done in
this world, and they themselves are quickly forgotten by the living; and
had Christ continued in this state, and had not risen again to our
justification, how would his justifying righteousness have been
revealed, as it is from faith to faith in the Gospel, which is therefore
called the word and ministration of righteousness?

[Psalms 88:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 88:13</span></span>

But unto thee have I cried, O Lord,.... Formerly, and had been heard,
answered, and relieved, and which was an encouragement to cry again to
him in his distress; Christ was always heard, [Joh
11:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#042.md), or, now, in his present case,
yet was not heard, at least not immediately answered; which was the case
of the Messiah, when forsaken by his God and Father, [Psa
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001.md), yet still determines to continue
praying, as follows:

and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee; not before the Lord is
awake, and can hear; for he neither slumbers nor sleeps, and he always
hears: but the meaning is, that he would pray before he entered upon
another business; this should be the first thing in the morning he would
do, and this he would do before others did, or he himself used to do;
before the usual time of morning prayer; signifying, he would pray to
him very early, which is expressive of his vehemency, fervency, and
importunity and earnestness, and what a sense he had of his case, and of
his need of divine help: so Christ rose early in the morning, a great
while before day, to pray, [Mar 1:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#035.md).
See Gill on [Psa 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#004.md).

[Psalms 88:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 88:14</span></span>

Lord, why castest thou off my soul?.... Here begins his prayer, which he
determined to present early in the morning, and consists of
expostulations, and a representation of his distressed case: this shows
that he was under soul desertion, and which was what so greatly
afflicted him; imagining that his soul was cast off by the Lord, and had
no more share in his affection, and was no more under his care, and in
his sight: such expostulations of the saints, the church, and people of
God, in a like case, are elsewhere met with, [Psa
43:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#003.md) and may be applied to Christ,
when his soul was exceeding sorrowful unto death, and was made an
offering for sin; and particularly when he was forsaken by his Father:
the Targum is,

"why hast thou forsaken my soul?''

and rises the word "sabachtha", which Christ did when on the cross, [Mat
27:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#046.md), the Septuagint version is,

"wherefore, O Lord, dost thou reject my prayers?''

"why hidest thou thy face from me?" which is a denial of sensible
communion, a withdrawing the influences and communications of divine
grace for a time; and which sometimes is the case of the best of men, as
Job, David, and others; and is very grieving and distressing to them;
and, for the most part, is on account of sin; it is sin which separates
between God and his people, and causes him to hide his face from them,
or not grant them his gracious presence: this was the case of Christ,
who knew no sin, while he was suffering for the sins of his people; see
[Psa 69:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#017.md) compared with [Mat
27:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#046.md).

[Psalms 88:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 88:15</span></span>

I am afflicted,.... In body and mind, from within and from without, by
Satan, by the men of the world, and by the Lord himself; which is the
common lot of God's people, [Psa 34:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#019.md)
and was the case of the Messiah, who was afflicted both with the tongues
and hands of men, by words, by blows, and by the temptations of Satan;
and was smitten and afflicted of God, by divine justice, as the sinner's
surety: see [Psa 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#024.md) or

I am poor (a); which as it is a character, which, for the most part,
agrees with the saints, who are the poor of this world God has chosen,
to whom the Gospel is sent, and by whom it is received, and who are
effectually called by it, so likewise belongs to Christ, [Zac
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009.md),

and ready to die, from my youth up; a sickly unhealthful person from his
infancy, and often in danger of death; which last was certainly the case
of Christ in his infancy, through the malice of Herod; and many times
afterwards, when grown up, through the attempts of the Jews to take away
his life: some render it, "I am ready to die through concussion", or
"shaking" (b); meaning some very rough and severe dispensation of
Providence, such an one as Job expresses by shaking him to pieces, [Job
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#012.md) and was literally true of
Christ, when his body was so shaken by the jog of the cross, that all
his bones were put out of joint, [Psa
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#014.md).

while I suffer thy terrors; or "bear" (c) them, or "carry", even
terrible afflictions, in which he had terrible apprehensions of the
wrath of God in them, of death they would issue in, and of an awful
judgment that should follow that; all which are called the terrors of
the Lord, [Job 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#004.md), and which the
saints, when left to God, have some dreadful apprehensions of: such were
the terrors of the Lord the Messiah endured, when in a view of the sins
of his people being laid upon him, and of the wrath of God coming on him
for them, his sweat was, as it were, great drops of blood falling to the
ground, [Luk 22:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#044.md). Compare with this
[Psa 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#004.md).

I am distracted: not out of his mind, deprived of his senses, and
without the use of reason; but his thoughts were distracted and
confused, and his mind discomposed with the terrors of God upon him: the
Hebrew word "aphunah" is only used in this place, and is difficult of
interpretation, and is variously derived and rendered: some take it to
be of the same root with "pen", which signifies "lest, perhaps" (d);
seeing persons in a panic are apt to use such expressions; perhaps, or
it may be, such and such things will befall me; forming and framing in
their minds ten thousand dreadful things, which they fear are coming
upon them; so Aben Ezra and Kimchi; and is applied by Cocceius (e) to
the solicitous care and fear of Christ concerning his body, the church,
[Heb 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007.md) others derive it from
"ophen", which signifies a wheel, and so may be rendered, "I am wheeled
about" (f); always in motion, and have no rest day nor night; as Christ
was after his apprehension, being carried from place to place, and from
bar to bar: others derive it from the Arabic word "aphan" (g), which
signifies to be in want of counsel and advice: Christ though, as God,
needed no counsel, nor did he take counsel with any; and, as Mediator,
is the wonderful Counsellor; yet, as man, he needed it, and had it from
his Father, for which he blesses him, [Psa
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#007.md), others from the Hebrew root
"phanah", which signifies to look unto, as persons in a panic look here
and there; and as Christ did when suffering, who looked, and there was
none to help, [Isa 63:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#005.md). The Syriac
and Arabic versions render it "amazed", or "astonished", which is said
of Christ, [Mar 14:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#033.md), the Vulgate
Latin version is "troubled", which also agrees with Christ, [Joh
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#027.md) as he must needs be, when his
enemies surrounded him, the sins of his people were upon him, the sword
of justice awaked against him, and the wrath of God on him, as follows.

[Psalms 88:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 88:16</span></span>

Thy fierce wrath goeth over me,.... Or "wraths" (h), burning wrath; the
whole of divine wrath, in all its fierceness, due to the sins of his
people: these, like the mighty waves of the sea, passed over him,
threatening to overwhelm him, [Psa
89:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#038.md),

thy terrors have cut me off; from the presence of God, and out of his
sight; as sometimes the Lord's people are ready to imagine, when
forsaken by him, [Psa 31:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#022.md) or from
the land of the living, as the Messiah was, and in a judicial way,
though not for any sin of his own, [Isa
53:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#008.md).

\(h\) "irae tuae", Pagninus, Montanus; "furores tui", Musculus, Tigurine

[Psalms 88:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 88:17</span></span>

They came round about me daily like water,.... That is, the terrors of
the Lord, the sorrows of death and hell, [Psa
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#004.md), this was the Messiah's case,
when it was with him as is expressed [Psa
69:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#001.md),

they compassed me about together; as waters coming from many places,
from all quarters, meet together, and together surround a person or
place in such circumstances was Christ, when the bulls of Bashan beset
him around, and the assembly of the wicked enclosed him, and innumerable
evils encompassed him about, [Psa
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#012.md).

[Psalms 88:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 88:18</span></span>

Lover and friend hast thou put far from me,.... This is mentioned in
[Psa 88:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#008.md), and is here repeated; and
the account is closed with it, to show that this was a most aggravating
circumstance of his affliction, and which bore exceeding hard upon him;
and this must be a very uncomfortable case, to be in distress, whether
of body or mind, and to have no kind friend near to yield the least
help, relief, and comfort; so Christ's lovers and friends, his
disciples, who loved him and he loved them, and reckoned them as his
friends, and was a friend to them, when he was taken by his enemies,
they all forsook him, and fled, [Mat
26:56](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#056.md),

and mine acquaintance into darkness; either by death into the dark
grave, which Job calls the land of darkness and shadow of death, [Job
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#021.md), or being removed from him, so
that he could not see them, it was all one to him as if they had been
put into darkness, into some dark dungeon, or into the grave itself: or
the words may be rendered, mine acquaintance are darkness (i): this was
the case of Christ, when on the cross; he had none near him, no
acquaintance about him, but darkness; and darkness was over all the land
for the space of three hours; and a darkness was on his soul, being
forsaken by his Father; and the prince of darkness, with all the fiends
of hell, were throwing their fiery darts at him, [Mat
27:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#045.md). Thus ends this sorrowful and
mournful song; a joyful one follows.

sunt caligo", Gejerus.
