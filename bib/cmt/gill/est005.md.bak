INTRODUCTION TO ESTHER 5

This chapter gives an account of Esther's going in to the king, and of
his holding out the golden sceptre to her, on which she invited him and
Haman to a banquet of wine that day, and to another the next day, [Est
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#001.md), which highly delighted Haman; and
he went to his house and family with great joy, and yet chagrined at
Mordecai's not bowing to him; wherefore, at the advice of his wife and
friends, he erected a gallows to hang him upon, proposing to get a grant
for it from the king the next day, [Est
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#009.md).

[Esther 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">est 5:1</span></span>

Now it came to pass on the third day,.... Of the fast; though the former
Targum paraphrases it the third day of the passover, the sixteenth of
Nisan; see Gill on [Est 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#017.md), though
it is probable this was nearer the time fixed for the destruction of the
Jews, see [Est 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#009.md), yet the Jews have
fixed the fast of Esther on that very day, the thirteenth of Adar (f):

that Esther put on her royal apparel; in order to go in to the king, and
appear before him; which to do in a mournful habit, such as she had on
when fasting, was not proper; for then she put off her royal crown, as
is intimated in the additions to the book of Esther,And upon the third
day, when she had ended her prayers, she laid away her mourning
garments, and put on her glorious apparel. (Esther 15:1)and as was usual
for princes to do in times of mourning (g); but now she put it on, as
both Ben Gorion (h) and the latter Targum affirm:

and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against the
king's house; into which none might go but such as were called; yet
Esther being queen, the keepers of the door could not forbid her, as
Aben Ezra observes:

and the king sat upon his royal throne, in the royal house, over against
the gate of the house; so that he could see whoever came in at it, into
the inner court.

[Esther 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">est 5:2</span></span>

And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court,
that she obtained favour in his sight,.... Which no doubt was of God,
who has the hearts of kings in his hand, and turns them as he pleases;
the king had not called her for thirty days past, or more, which showed
coolness of affection to her, and now she transgressed a law by coming
uncalled for, which might have provoked his wrath; and for a lesser
matter than this was Vashti divorced; but yet his mind was inclined to
her, and she appeared very amiable and pleasing to him:

and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand;
as a token of his well pleasedness in her, and acceptance of her; and
that no harm should come to her for transgressing the law:

so Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre; as
acknowledging his kindness, and her thankfulness for it, as well as
subjection and obedience to him.

[Esther 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">est 5:3</span></span>

Then said the king unto her, what wilt thou, Queen Esther?.... He
supposed she had some business with him, some suit to make to him, by
her coming in this manner:

and what is thy request? signifying he was ready to grant it, be it what
it would:

it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom; as it was usual
with the Persian kings to give their wives cities for certain purposes;
see Gill on [Est 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#018.md), here Ahasuerus,
out of his great affection to Esther, offers half of his dominions, his
one hundred and twenty seven provinces; meaning that he would grant her
anything, and everything that was reasonable, and even magnificent; it
is an hyperbolical and courtly way of speaking, and which has been used
in later times, and in other countries; see [Mar
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#023.md).

[Esther 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">est 5:4</span></span>

And Esther answered, if it seem good unto the king,.... She humbly
submits it to his pleasure, suggesting it would be exceeding grateful to
her, could it be granted:

let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have
prepared for him; for the king; and supposing it would be acceptable to
him, and the rather engage him to come to it, she invited his favourite;
and chiefly, that she might have an opportunity of accusing him before
the king to his face, and when alone.

[Esther 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">est 5:5</span></span>

Then the king said, cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther
hath said,.... That is, he ordered some of his servants to make haste
and acquaint Haman with the queen's invitation, and to press him to make
haste to comply with it:

so the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared;
which was wisely done, to prepare for what she had to say to the king,
when cheerful with wine, and when she had her adversary with him alone.

[Esther 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">est 5:6</span></span>

And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine,.... For such it
seems the banquet was she prepared; it was not properly a meal, neither
dinner nor supper, but a drinking bout; or, however, it was at that part
of the banquet in which wine was drank that the king accosted Esther,
when he began to be cheerful with it. The Persians at their meals had
two courses: the first consisted of meats, &c. at which they drank
water, the other of fruits, when they drank wine; Aelianus (i) says, the
Persians, after they are filled with food, indulge themselves in
drinking wine:

what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy
request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed; by which
it appears he retained the same affection for Esther, and the same
disposition to show her kindness. See [Est
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#003.md).

\(i\) Var. Hist. l. 12. c. 1.

[Esther 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">est 5:7</span></span>

Then answered Esther and said, my petition and my request is. What she
should for the present make; the principal one she had to ask, for wise
reasons, she still deferred.

[Esther 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">est 5:8</span></span>

If I have found favour in the sight of the king,.... Or, seeing she had;
for it was a clear case she had, both by his holding out the golden
sceptre to her, and by accepting her invitation to her banquet:

and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my
request; as he had been so gracious as to promise in such a large and
liberal manner as before expressed:

let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for
them; the Targum says, in the evening; but from [Est
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#012.md), it appears to be on the morrow;
and which agrees with what follows:

and I will do tomorrow as the king hath said; make her petition and
request to him; which she had deferred, partly in hope of still
increasing his affection to her, and partly to prepare him to expect
something of moment and importance to be asked of him. Jarchi restrains
this to what he supposes the king had often importuned her to tell,
namely, who were her people and her kindred.

[Esther 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">est 5:9</span></span>

Then went Haman forth that day, joyful, and with a glad heart,.... From
court to his own house

but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood not up,
nor moved for him; did not show him the least degree even of civil
respect; which he refused to do, partly lest it should be interpreted an
adoration of him, and partly because it was well known to him he had
formed a scheme for the destruction of him and all his people; and the
rather he refused it to him, as Esther was about to make intercession
with the king to revoke his decree, of the success of which he had no
doubt; and therefore had nothing to fear from him, but treated him with
the utmost contempt, as he deserved:

he was full of wrath against Mordecai; it was a sad mortification to
him, and a great allay of that joy and elation of mind on account of the
favour he was in; not with the king only, but the queen also, as he
imagined.

[Esther 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">est 5:10</span></span>

Nevertheless Haman refrained himself,.... From showing any outward
resentment to Mordecai, from laying hands upon him or taking revenge on
him, as being too much below him to avenge himself on a single person,
when the whole body of the people Mordecai belonged to would shortly
feel the power of his hand for such insolent treatment of him:

and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh
his wife; who, the Targum says, was the daughter of Tatnai, the governor
on the other side the river, [Ezr 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#003.md).

[Esther 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">est 5:11</span></span>

And Haman told them of the glory of his riches,.... Of the multitude of
them; which he did partly in a way of ostentation, and partly, if he
could, to make his mind easy under the mortification he received from
Mordecai; and, it may be, chiefly to aggravate his rudeness and ill
behaviour towards him, a man of so much wealth: and the multitude of his
children; he had ten, as we learn from [Est
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#010.md), but the former Targum enlarges
them, beyond credit, to the number of two hundred and eight, besides his
ten sons, and Shimshai the scribe; such were had in great esteem with
the Persians who had many children; to such the king used to send gifts
annually (k):

and all the things wherein the king had promoted him; the high offices
of honour and trust he had put him into:

and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.
See [Est 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#001.md).

[Esther 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">est 5:12</span></span>

Haman said, moreover,.... To all which he added, and what seemed to
delight him most of all, or however was a new additional honour done
him:

yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the
banquet that she had prepared but myself; which he judged was doing him
singular honour; and, by the joint affection of the king and queen to
him, he thought himself established in his dignity and grandeur:

and tomorrow am I invited unto her also with the king; had been invited,
not by a messenger, but by the queen herself, which was a double honour.

[Esther 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">est 5:13</span></span>

Yet all this availeth me nothing,.... Is not equal or sufficient for me;
it gives me no satisfaction and contentment:

so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate: not rising
up to bow unto him; this single circumstance spoiled all his joy and
pleasure.

[Esther 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">est 5:14</span></span>

Then said Zeresh his wife, and all his friends, unto him,.... His wife
very probably first moved it, and all his friends present approved of it
and united in it:

let a gallows be made, of fifty cubits, high; that the person hanged
thereon might be seen at a distance, and so be a greater reproach to
him, and a terror to others, to take care they were not guilty of the
same offence: Cartalo was ordered by his father to be fixed to the
highest cross in the sight of the city (l); and it was usual for crosses
to be erected very high (m) both for that purpose, and for greater
infamy and disgrace (n):

and tomorrow speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged
thereon; get a grant from him for it; of which they made no doubt, since
Haman had such an interest in him, and had already obtained an order to
destroy all Jews in his dominions:

then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet; eased of the
burden of his mind, and honoured to be a guest with the royal pair:

and the thing pleased Haman, and he caused the gallows to be made; but
it was for himself, as it proved in the issue. See [Est
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#010.md).
