INTRODUCTION TO 1 CORINTHIANS 6

The principal view of this chapter is to dissuade Christians from going
to law with one another before Heathens, and also from fornication: the
apostle begins with the first of these, and argues against it, from its
being a daring, dangerous, and scandalous practice; and from the
different characters of the persons, before whom controversies about
civil things among Christians should and should not be brought; the one
being saints, and so conscientious persons, and would do the right
thing; the other unjust, and so justice could not be expected to be done
by them, [Co1 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#001.md), and that the
former, and not the latter, should be appointed judges in such cases, is
argued from the greater to the lesser; that seeing these will judge the
world, much more then should they be employed in matters of less
consequence, [Co1 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#002.md) and by the same
sort of argument it is further urged, that even angels themselves shall
be judged by the saints; then much more might affairs appertaining to
this life, be brought before them, and be decided by them, [Co1
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#003.md) yea, even the things that were
litigated by them, and which they had power of judging in, were such as
might be determined by the men of the least capacity among them, and
therefore had no need to bring them before Heathen magistrates, [Co1
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#004.md) besides, it could not be spoken
of, but to their shame, that after all their boast of their gifts,
learning, and eloquence, there was not one man of wisdom and ability
among them, to judge in matters of civil property, [Co1
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#005.md) and this evil of commencing law
suits in Heathen courts of judicature, is aggravated by its being done,
not between Christians and heathens, but between one Christian brother
and another, and that before men that were infidels, [Co1
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#006.md) and which to do, showed a great
deficiency of love, wisdom, and care; and much better it was to take and
suffer wrong, than to be guilty of such criminal conduct, [Co1
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#007.md) yea, those, that drew their
brethren before such judgment seats, did them wrong, both by bringing
them thither, and by getting their cause in an unjust manner, [Co1
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#008.md) wherefore, to deter from such
unrighteous procedures, the apostles declares, that all injurious
persons, and wicked men in any way, and of any sort, should not inherit
the kingdom of God, [Co1 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#009.md) and
whereas some of those the apostle writes to had been such, but now
through the grace of God were otherwise, this should be considered as an
argument, why they should not contend with one another before persons
destitute of the grace they were partakers of, [Co1
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#011.md) and now the apostle having
mentioned fornication as a sin which excluded from the kingdom of God,
and this being reckoned by the Gentiles an indifferent thing; he first
observes of indifferent things in general, that are really so, that
though they are lawful to be used, it is not expedient to use them at
all times, and under all circumstances; and especially care should be
taken, that by the use of them, we do not become slaves unto them, [Co1
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#012.md) and then particularly instances
in meats, which without distinction might be lawfully eaten, they being
made for the belly, and the belly for them; which was answering the
original design of them, though hereafter both will be destroyed; yet
fornication must not be put upon a level with them, and reckoned
indifferent as they are; since the body was not made to be abused and
defiled, or for fornication: but to be redeemed and sanctified by the
Lord, and to serve him, and who was appointed for the redemption and
sanctification of that, [Co1 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#013.md)
moreover, the sin of fornication is dissuaded from, by the consideration
of the resurrection of the body as a glorious one, by the power of God,
of which Christ's resurrection is a pledge; and therefore should not be
defiled with this sin, [Co1 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#014.md) as
also from the bodies of the saints being the members of Christ; and
therefore should not be made the members of an harlot by fornication,
these things being utterly absurd and inconsistent, [Co1
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#015.md). Which is illustrated by
observing, that he that is joined in unlawful copulation with an harlot,
becomes one flesh with her, [Co1 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#016.md)
which is confirmed by a passage cited out of [Gen
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#024.md) which regards carnal copulation
in general; but one that is in union with Christ, and is become a member
of him, is one spirit with him; and therefore since there is such a
spiritual union between them, fornication, which joins, unites, and
makes a man one with an harlot, should be carefully avoided, [Co1
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#017.md) and in order the more to deter
from this sin, the apostle observes, that it is not like some other
sins, which are without the body, but this is by it, and with it, and
against it; it is dishonourable, and may be hurtful to it, [Co1
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#018.md) to which he adds, that the bodies
of the saints are the temples of the Holy Ghost, where he dwells, and
therefore should not be polluted with fornication, [Co1
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#019.md) and closes all with an argument,
taken from their bodies not being their own property, to use and abuse
at pleasure, but the purchase of Christ's blood; and therefore it was
incumbent upon them to glorify him with them, as well as with their
spirits, and not defile them with fornication.

[1 Corinthians 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 6:1</span></span>

Dare any of you, having a matter against another,...., Any thing in
difference, an action, cause, or suit. The apostle having dispatched the
affair of the incestuous person, and blamed this church for their
conduct therein: and having given them instructions what they should do,
proceeds to lay before them another evil among them he had to complain
of; which was, when any difference arose among them about their worldly
concerns, they would

go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints; a method of
proceeding condemned by the Jews, who would not suffer any causes of
theirs to be tried before Gentiles, only before Israelites; their canon
runs thus (u),

"he that tries a cause before the judges of the Gentiles, and before
their tribunals, although their judgments are as the judgments of the
Israelites, lo, this is an ungodly man; and it is as if he blasphemed
and reproached, and lift up his hand against the law of Moses our
master, as it is said, [Exo 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#001.md) now
these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them, , "and not
before the Gentiles"; , "and not before idiots", private or illiterate
men.''

They looked upon such an action as bad as profaning the name of God;
hence they say (w),

"we must not try a cause in the courts of the Gentiles, for they come
from the strength of judgment; this is Esau an hairy man, for they have
no concord nor mercy--and he that comes before thee , "profanes the name
of God", who is gracious and merciful, and honours the name of an
idol--wherefore he that brings a cause before the Gentiles, is the
occasion of spreading the property of judgment in the world----therefore
let a cause be tried before the Israelites, for they are the secret of
mercy, and not before the Gentiles, nor before idiots:''

they affirm (x) it to be a greater sin than murder, and that not only
profanations of the name of God, but rapine and violence are
comprehended in it; and that to give evidence in an Heathen court
against an Israelite, deserves excommunication; for so it is said, (y).

"he that bears witness against an Israelite , "in the courts of the
Gentiles", and by his testimony gets money from him, which is not
according to the judgment of the Israelites, they excommunicate him
until he repays it.''

Again (z).

"it is forbidden to order causes in the courts of (the rest of the
nations) idolaters, for they have no part in the side of our faith.''

The apostle here dissuades from this practice, of going to law before
Heathen magistrates, not only from its being an imprudent, but an
impudent, "daring", rash and adventurous action; and seems surprised
that any should attempt it, when it must unavoidably expose their
weaknesses and faults to their enemies; nor could they expect justice to
be done them by men of such a character, as "unjust", who neither feared
God, nor regarded men; were not only destitute of righteousness, but
filled with all unrighteousness, and had not so much as the principles
of common justice and equity in them; when on the contrary, from the
saints, men who have the principles of grace and holiness wrought in
them, and live soberly, righteously, and godly, who have the fear of God
before their eyes, and upon their hearts; they might reasonably
conclude, were matters brought before them, they would be adjusted
according to judgment and truth, without exposing the sin and weakness
of any party to the world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 6:2</span></span>

Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world,.... The apostle
appeals to them concerning this matter, as a thing well known unto them,
or might easily be known by them; for this was either a traditional
notion among the Jews, many of whom were in this church, that good men
should judge the world; as is said of the righteous in the apocryphal
book:

"They shall judge the nations, and have dominion over the people, and
their Lord shall reign for ever.'' (Wisdom 3:8)

and so the Jews say (a), that

"the first day of the month is the beginning of judgment in the whole
world, and Isaac sat on a throne, , "to judge the world":''

or this might be collected, as Dr. Lightfoot observes, out of [Dan
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#018.md), but the difficulty is, in what
sense the apostle means the saints shall judge the world; not merely in
a comparative sense, for so even will the Heathens, the men of Nineveh,
and the queen of Sheba, judge and condemn the Jews; nor as assessors on
the throne with Christ, for though they shall sit on the same throne
with him as reigning, yet not as judging with him, all judgment is
solely committed to him: nor merely as approving that judiciary
sentence, that will be pronounced by him on the world; for even wicked
men themselves, and devils, will be obliged to own the justice of it;
but his meaning is, that in a little time the saints, Christian men, men
under a profession of Christianity at least, should be governors in the
world, and bear the office of civil magistracy in it; which came to pass
in a few centuries after the writing of this, and has been more or less
the case ever since; and will be more so in the latter day, when kings
shall be nursing fathers, and queens nursing mothers to the church; and
when the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under
the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most
High: upon which the apostle strongly argues,

and if the world shall be judged by you; if such men as you shall bear
sway in it, fill up all civil offices in it, even the highest; shall sit
upon the benches of judges, and on the thrones of kings, and at last
have the government of the whole world; since such honour the saints
shall have, and be abundantly capable of it,

are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? is it too high a post,
and can you be thought to be unqualified for, and unfit to have such
trivial things, of little or no moment and importance, things relating
to the common affairs of life, brought before you, and be tried, and
judged by you?

\(a\) Ibid. in Lev. fol. 13. 4.

[1 Corinthians 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 6:3</span></span>

Know ye not that we shall judge angels,.... Meaning not the ministers of
the Gospel, and pastors of churches, called "angels", [Rev
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#020.md) whose doctrines are examined,
tried, and judged by the saints, according to the word of God; nor the
good angels, who, were it possible that they could, or should publish a
Gospel contrary to what has been preached by the apostle, would be
contradicted, condemned, and accursed by him, see [Gal
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#008.md) but the evil angels, the devil and
his angels: and this is to be understood not of their future final
judgment and condemnation at the last day, when saints will subscribe
unto, and approve of the sentence pronounced upon them, and will triumph
over them in their destruction; but of the judgment of them, and of
their ejection out of the Gentile world, out of their oracles, idols,
and idol temples, to which Christ refers, [Joh
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031.md) and calls the judgment of this
world, and the casting out of the prince of it by the ministry of his
apostles; and which was now already begun, and ere long would be fully
accomplished: accordingly the Syriac version renders it, "know ye not ,
that we are about to judge angels?" and the Arabic, "know ye not that we
judge angels?" from whence the apostle infers very justly,

how much more things that pertain to this life? this animal life; to the
trade and business of life; to pecuniary matters, to estates and
possessions in this world, about which differences may arise between one
saint and another.

[1 Corinthians 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 6:4</span></span>

If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life,.... Not
judgements relating to life and death, for these were not in the power
of a Jewish sanhedrim now, and much less of a Christian community, but
were wholly in the power of the Roman magistrates; but judgments
relating to the common affairs of life, or what the Jews call ,
"pecuniary judgments" (b), in distinction from , "judgments of souls",
or capital ones. The Jews say (c),

"that forty years before the destruction of the temple, capital
judgments were taken from Israel; and in the days of R. Simeon ben
Jochai, pecuniary judgments were taken away from Israel.''

Now this Rabbi lived many years after the times of the apostles, so that
as yet the Jews had a power of exercising such judgments; and no doubt
the Christian's also, who as yet were very little, if at all,
distinguished from the Jews by the Romans: and therefore since such
judgments were within the compass of their authority, the apostle
advises

to set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church; meaning, not
those of the lowest circumstances of life, and of the meanest abilities
and capacities; for in the next verse he requires a wise man for such a
business; but private persons, laymen, who were not in any office and
authority in the church, in distinction from pastors, elders, and
rulers, that were in office, power, and high esteem, whom he would not
have troubled with cases of this nature; but should rather choose out
from among the laity persons of the best judgment and capacity, to be
umpires and arbitrators in such worldly matters, which do not so
properly come under the notice and cognizance of spiritual guides. The
phrase, "to judge", is not in the original text, where it is only "set",
or "put in the chair"; but is added in the Vulgate Latin version; and to
which agree both the Syriac and Arabic versions; the former reading the
words, "they that are despised in the church, set for you in judgment";
and the latter, "make them to sit judges". The Jews, as Dr. Lightfoot
observes, besides their great sanhedrim of seventy one persons, and that
other of twenty three in their cities of note, and their triumvirate in
every synagogue, had also two sorts of benches, who judged of lesser
matters; the one was called , "the bench of authorized persons",
experienced men, that were approved of, and had their authority from the
sanhedrim; and the other was called , "the bench of idiots" (d), or
private persons, or , "the bench of those who were not authorized" (e),
or had not their authority, from the higher courts; but being judged
proper persons, were chosen by the people to arbitrate matters in
difference between them; and these are the men the apostle means, at
least alludes to, before whom he would have the causes brought.

[1 Corinthians 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 6:5</span></span>

I speak to your shame,.... Not that they did set such persons to judge,
but that they did not; and instead of so doing went to law with their
brethren before the unjust:

is it so that there is not a wise man among you? this also the apostle
speaks to their shame, who had so much gloried in their wisdom, and
boasted of their parts and abilities to the contempt of others, and even
of the apostle himself; and yet acted as if there was not a wise man
among them capable of judging and determining trivial matters, but they
must carry them before unconverted persons:

no not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren? for though
the above mentioned benches consisted of three persons, yet the
contending parties might choose one man to be an arbitrator and judge
between them. The rule with the Jews was this (f);

"pecuniary judgments are by three, but if he is authorised or approved
by the majority, , "he may judge alone". Says R. Nachman, as I judge
pecuniary judgments alone; and so says R. Chaijah, as I judge pecuniary
punishments alone.''

[1 Corinthians 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 6:6</span></span>

But brother goeth to law with brother,.... The relation meant is
spiritual; it was usual for members of churches to be called brethren,
they professing to be born again of the same Father, and belonging to
the same family under Christ, the son, firstborn, and master of it: and
a very wicked and shameful thing it was, that persons in such a
relation, being of such a family, should go to law with one another at
all:

and that before the unbelievers; which is an aggravation of their sin
and folly. The apostle before calls them "unjust", now "infidels", such
as had no faith in Christ, disbelieved the Messiah, and denied the whole
Gospel, and therefore no faith or confidence should be put in them; for,
generally speaking, such as have no faith, are not only wicked, but
unreasonable men, men of no reason, conscience, justice, and equity; and
therefore very improper persons for believers to bring their causes
before.

[1 Corinthians 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 6:7</span></span>

Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you,.... Or a "defect": a
want of brotherly love, or there would be no occasion to go to law at
all; a want of wisdom and conduct, or proper persons would be pitched
upon, and chosen out from among themselves to be arbitrators and judge
between them; and a want of care among their leaders, who else would
have pointed out to them such a method of accommodation, and not have
suffered them to go the lengths they did:

because ye go to law one with another; which would never be, was there
not a declension among you, a decay of your first love, and of the power
of religion and true godliness:

why do ye not rather take wrong why do ye not rather suffer yourselves
to be defrauded? than to go to law, especially before unjust persons and
unbelievers, taking the advice of Christ, [Mat
5:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#040.md) It is more advisable to a
believer to suffer wrong than to go to law with any man, and especially
with a brother. It is a petition in the Jewish liturgy (g),

"let it please thee, O Lord God, and the God of my fathers, to deliver
me this day, and every day---from hard judgment, and a severe adversary,
, "whether he be a Son of the covenant, or whether he be not a son of
the covenant".''

\(g\) Seder Tephillot, fol. 3. 2. Ed. Basil. fol. 5. 2. Ed. Amst.

[1 Corinthians 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 6:8</span></span>

Nay, you do wrong and defraud,.... So far were they from taking and
acting up to the advice given, that instead of taking wrong, they did
wrong; and instead of suffering themselves to be defrauded, they
defrauded others:

and that your brethren; that were of the same faith, of the same
religion, and in the same church and family: in short, neither party,
not the plaintiff, nor the defendant, sought anything more or less than
to wrong, trick, and defraud each other; such a sad corruption and
degeneracy prevailed among them: hence the apostle thought to deal
plainly and closely with them, as in the following verses.

[1 Corinthians 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 6:9</span></span>

Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of
God?.... A way of speaking much like that in the Talmud, "know thou,
that the world to come is not made but for the righteous?" (h) Without a
righteousness there will be no entrance into the world of bliss and
happiness hereafter; and this must be a better righteousness than what a
sinful creature is capable of working out, and no other than the
righteousness of Christ. It was a loss and want of righteousness that
cast the angels down from heaven, and turned Adam out of paradise; and
whoever of his posterity: are destitute of one, will fall short of
enjoying the glory of God; for it is not agreeable to the holy nature of
God, to his infinite justice and righteous law, to admit any into heaven
without a righteousness: hence a judgment seat is erected, before which
all must stand; and those that will be found without a righteousness,
will be for ever excluded the kingdom of heaven; and could any
unrighteous persons be received there, it would spoil the pleasure and
happiness of the saints. Now this is said, partly to dissuade the
Corinthians from going to law with each other before unrighteous
persons, who have no right to the kingdom of God, and living and dying
as they are, will have no share in it; and therefore since they are not
to be fellow heirs and companions with them in another world, they
should not bring their causes before them in this; and partly to reprove
them for their injurious and unrighteous actions among themselves, their
tricking and defrauding of one another, with other sins they were guilty
of; which, if not repented of, would show, that notwithstanding their
profession, they were destitute of the grace of God, were unfit to be in
the kingdom of God, in a Gospel church state here below, and would be
shut out of the kingdom of heaven hereafter.

Be not deceived imagining, that through your knowledge and profession
you shall be saved, live as you will:

neither fornicators, such as are guilty of uncleanness with persons in a
single state:

nor idolaters; who worship more gods than one, and not the true God; who
do service to them that are not gods, and perform what the Jews call
"strange service": and not only fall down to stocks and stones, but
serve divers lusts and pleasures, the idols of their own hearts:

nor adulterers: such as have criminal conversation with persons in a
married state:

nor effeminate; or "soft", or, as the Syriac renders it, "corrupters";
that is, of themselves, by voluntary pollution, such as are guilty of
the sin of Onan, [Gen 38:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#008.md).

Nor abusers of themselves with mankind; sodomites.

\(h\) T. Bab. Yebamot, fol 47. 1.

[1 Corinthians 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 6:10</span></span>

Nor thieves,.... Who take away another man's property, secret or openly,
by fraud or force.

Nor covetous: insatiable, in the lust of uncleanness; or greedy of
worldly gain, bent upon increasing their substance at any rate, by
circumvention, fraud, and deceit; and do not use the things of this life
as they should, for their own good, and that of others.

Nor drunkards who are strong to drink strong liquors; who give up
themselves thereunto: who sit down on purpose to intoxicate themselves,
and are frequent in the commission of this sin.

Nor revilers; who are free with other men's characters, load them with
reproaches, and take away their good names; either openly or secretly,
either by tale bearing, whispering, and backbiting, or by raising and
spreading scandalous reports in a public manner.

Nor extortioners ravishers of virgins; or plunderers of men's substance
in an open and forcible way; or who extort unlawful gain:

shall inherit the kingdom of God; not that these sins, any or all of
them, are unpardonable; for such who have been guilty of them may,
through the blood of Christ, receive the remission of them, and through
the grace of the Spirit of God obtain repentance for them, and have both
right and meetness for the kingdom of heaven, as the following words
show.

[1 Corinthians 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 6:11</span></span>

And such were some of you,.... Not all, but some of them; and of these
everyone was not guilty of all these crimes; but some had been guilty of
one, and others of another; so that they had been all committed by one
or another of them. The Corinthians were a people very much given to
uncleanness and luxury, without measure (i), which was the ruin of their
state: and among these wicked people God had some chosen vessels of
salvation; who are put in mind of their former state, partly for their
present humiliation, when they considered what they once were, no better
than others, but children of wrath, even as others; and partly to
observe to them, and the more to illustrate and magnify the grace of God
in their conversion, pardon, justification, and salvation; as also to
point out to them the obligations that lay upon them to live otherwise
now than they formerly did.

But ye are washed; which is not to be understood of external washing, of
corporeal ablution, or of their being baptized in water; so they might
be, and yet not be cleansed from their filthiness, either by original or
actual transgressions; nor of the washing of regeneration, which more
properly comes under the next head; but of their being washed from their
sins by the blood of Christ, through the application of it to them, for
the remission of them; which supposes them to have been polluted, as
they were originally, being conceived in sin, and shapen in iniquity;
naturally, for who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? and
internally, in heart, mind, and conscience; also universally, both as to
persons, and as to the powers and faculties of their souls, and members
of their bodies; and that they could not wash and cleanse themselves by
any ceremonial purifications, moral duties, or evangelical performances;
but that this was a blessing of grace they enjoyed through the blood of
Christ, by which they were washed from their sins, both in the sight of
God, his justice being satisfied for them, they were all pardoned and
done away, so as to be seen no more, and they appeared unblamable and
irreprovable in his sight; and also in their own apprehensions, for
being convinced of their pollution, and being directed to Christ for
cleansing, the Spirit of God took his blood, and sprinkled it on their
consciences, to the appeasement of them, the removal of sin from thence,
and a non-remembrance of it.

But ye are sanctified; which designs not their sanctification by God the
Father, which is no other than the eternal separation of them from
himself, or his everlasting choice of them to eternal happiness; nor the
sanctification of them, or the expiation of their sins by the blood of
Christ, this is meant in the former clause; nor their sanctification in
Christ, or the imputation of his holiness with his obedience and death
for their justification, which is intended in the following one; but the
sanctification of the Spirit, which lies in a principle of spiritual
life infused into the soul, in a spiritual light in the understanding,
in a flexion of the will to the will of God, both in grace and
providence, in a settlement of the affections on divine objects, and in
an implantation of every grace; which is a gradual work, as yet not
perfect, but will be fulfilled in all in whom it is begun.

But ye are justified; not by the works of the law, but by the
righteousness of Christ. Justified they were from all eternity, as soon
as Christ became a surety for them; and so they were when he rose from
the dead, who were justified as their head and surety, and they in him;
but here it is to be understood of their being justified in the court of
conscience, under the witnessings of the Spirit of God; who having
convinced them of the insufficiency of their own righteousness, and
having brought near the righteousness of Christ unto them, and wrought
faith in them to lay hold on it, pronounced them justified persons in
their own consciences; whence followed joy, peace, and comfort.

In the name of the Lord Jesus; which may refer, as the following clause,
to all that is said before: by "the name of the Lord Jesus" may be meant
he himself; and the sense be, that they were washed by his blood,
sanctified by his Spirit, and justified by his righteousness; or it may
intend the merit and efficacy of Christ's blood, sacrifice, and
righteousness; as that their sins were pardoned, and they cleansed from
them through the merit of the blood of Christ shed for the remission of
their sins; and that they were regenerated and sanctified through the
efficacy of Christ's resurrection from the dead; and were instilled by
the grace of God, through the redemption that is in Christ: or else the
name of Christ may design his Gospel, through which they received the
knowledge of God's way of pardoning sinners, and justifying them, and
the Spirit of God, as a spirit of regeneration and sanctification:

and by the Spirit of our God; who sprinkled the blood of Christ upon
them, to the cleansing of them; who sanctified their hearts, and
revealed the righteousness of Christ unto them for their justification,
and pronounced the sentence of it upon them. It is to be observed, that
all the three persons, Father, Son, and Spirit, are here mentioned, as
being jointly concerned in those acts of grace.

[1 Corinthians 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 6:12</span></span>

All things are lawful unto me,.... That is, which are of an indifferent
nature; otherwise everything is not lawful to be done:

but all things are not expedient; when the doing of them destroys the
peace, comfort, and edification of others; when it stumbles and grieves
weak minds, and causes offence to them; see [Co1
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#023.md)

all things are lawful for me; which is repeated for the sake of saying
the following words:

but I will not be brought under the power of any; which would be very
inexpedient, should any by the use of liberty in things indifferent, on
the one hand, offend his brethren, and, on the other, bring himself into
bondage to those very things he has the free use of; and therefore the
apostle determines, that these shall not have the mastery over him, that
he will use them, or not use them, at his pleasure. It is somewhat
difficult to know what in particular he has respect unto, whether to
what he had been treating of before, concerning going to law before
unbelievers; and his sense be, that however lawful this might be in
itself, yet it was not expedient, since it was exposing of themselves to
ungodly persons, and a putting themselves under their power to judge and
determine as they pleased; or whether to the use of meats forbidden
under the law, or offered to idols; which though in themselves lawful to
be eaten, every creature of God being good, and not to be refused and
accounted common and unclean; yet it was not expedient to use this
liberty, if a weak brother should be grieved, or a man himself become a
slave to his appetite.

[1 Corinthians 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 6:13</span></span>

Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats,.... All sort of food is
appointed and provided to satisfy the appetite and stomach, to fill the
belly, and nourish the body; and the belly, and all the parts through
which the food passes, are purposely formed by God for the reception and
digestion of the food, for its secretion, chylification, and nutrition
by it, and the ejection of the excermentitious parts.

But God shall destroy both it and them: at death, and in the grave, when
the one shall be consumed, and the other be needless and useless; and
though that part of the body, with the rest, will be raised at the last
day, since the body will be raised perfect, consisting of all its parts;
yet there will be no appetite, no desire in the stomach after meats, no
need of them to fill the belly, and so no use of these parts for such
purposes as they now are; for the children of the resurrection will be
like the angels, and stand in no need of eating and drinking.

Now the body is not for fornication. Though meats are appointed for the
belly, and the belly for them, and this and the other sort of meats are
of an indifferent kind, which may or may not be used; yet this cannot be
said of fornication, which the Corinthians, and other Gentiles, took to
be equally indifferent as meats; but the apostle shows there is not the
same reason for the one as the other. The body was not originally made
and appointed for fornication; this is quite besides the will of God,
who has provided marriage as a remedy against it:

but for the Lord; for Jesus Christ, for whom a body was prepared in
God's council and covenant; and for the sake of which, and after the
exemplar of it in God's eternal mind, the body of man was first formed;
and which was also made, as after the image, so for the glory of Christ,
to be a member of his, to be redeemed by him, and to serve him in, in
righteousness and holiness, and at last to be raised by him, and made
like to his glorious body at the great day.

And the Lord for the body; he was preordained in the council of God, and
provided in the covenant of grace, and sent in the fulness of time to be
a Redeemer and Saviour of the body, as well as the soul; to be a
sanctifier of it, and the raiser of it up from the dead in the
resurrection; all which are so many arguments to dissuade from the sin
of fornication.

[1 Corinthians 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co1 6:14</span></span>

And God hath both raised up the Lord,.... God the Father has raised up
from the dead the Lord Jesus Christ, though not exclusive of the Son,
who was equally concerned in the resurrection of himself, whereby he
demonstrated himself to be the Son of God, truly and properly God.

And will also raise up us by his own power; for the resurrection of the
dead, whether of Christ, or of his people, is an act of power, of God's
own power, even of his almighty power, and is what the power of a mere
creature could never effect. Now as Christ, the head, is raised, so
shall all his members by the same power; their bodies will be raised
powerful, glorious, incorruptible; and spiritual; an argument that they
were never made for fornication, nor to be defiled with such
uncleanness.

[1 Corinthians 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co1 6:15</span></span>

Know ye not that your bodies are the members, of Christ,.... The whole
persons of God's elect were chosen in Christ, and given to him, and made
one with him, their bodies as well as their souls; and both are redeemed
by him, and, in union with him, are members of his body, of his flesh,
and of his bones:

shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an
harlot? God forbid. Signifying, that it is a most absurd, indecent,
abominable, and detestable thing, that the bodies of the saints, which
are the members of Christ, should be joined in carnal copulation with an
harlot.

[1 Corinthians 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co1 6:16</span></span>

What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot,.... Not in
marriage, but in carnal copulation, and unclean embraces, is one body
with her

for two ("saith he", Adam, or Moses, or God, or the Scripture, or as R.
Sol. Jarchi says, the Holy Spirit, [Gen
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#024).md)

shall be one flesh; what is originally said of copulation in lawful
marriage, in which man and wife, legally coupled together, become one
flesh, is applied to the unlawful copulation of a man with an harlot, by
which act they also become one body, one flesh; and which is made use of
by the apostle, to deter the members of Christ from the commission of
this sin, which makes a member of Christ one body and flesh with an
harlot, than which nothing is more monstrous and detestable. The apostle
here directs to the true sense of the phrase in Genesis, "and they shall
be one flesh"; that is, man and wife shall only have carnal knowledge
of, and copulation with each other. Some Jewish (k) writers interpret
this phrase, "on account of the foetus", which is formed by the means of
them both, and which becomes "their one flesh": others (l), thus as if
they were, or because they are, like as if they were one flesh; but
others (m), in more agreement with the apostle, think that this has
respect , "to that conjunction", by which the fixing of the species is
completed; and others (n) expressly thus, "they two shall be one flesh",
, "that is, in the place where both of them make one flesh": which is
equally done by unlawful copulation with an harlot, as with a man's own
wife.

[1 Corinthians 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co1 6:17</span></span>

He that is joined unto the Lord,.... As every elect person is; his whole
person, soul and body, is united to the Lord Jesus Christ, to his whole
person, as God-man and Mediator; even as Adam and Eve, whose marriage
was a representation of the marriage between Christ and his church, were
personally united, and were called by the same name; and as the whole
human nature of Christ, consisting of a true body and a reasonable soul,
was united to the person of the Son of God; and as appears from the
influence that union with Christ has upon the redemption,
sanctification, and resurrection of the body. The ground, foundation,
and bond of which union is, not the Spirit on Christ's part; for the
Spirit being received as a spirit of regeneration, sanctification, &c.
is a fruit of union to Christ, and an evidence of it; nor faith on our
part, which as a grace is not ours, but the gift of God, and is a fruit
of union; nor is it of an uniting nature, but is a grace of communion;
and the foundation of all its acts, as seeing Christ, going to him,
receiving of him, walking on in him; &c. is a previous union to Christ;
but it is the everlasting and unchangeable love of Christ to them, shown
in his choice of them, in his covenant with his Father on their behalf,
in his engaging for them as a surety, in assuming their nature, and
acting, both in time and eternity, as the representative of them, which
is the bond and cement of their union, and from which there can be no
separation. This union is first discovered in the effectual calling, and
will be more manifest hereafter. Now he that is in this sense united to
Christ,

is one spirit; for this union is a spiritual one; it is complete and
perfect; near and indissoluble; by virtue and in consequence of it,
God's chosen ones come to have and enjoy the same spirit in measure,
which Christ their head and Mediator has without measure: hence they
have the Spirit of God, as a spirit of illumination and conversion, of
faith and holiness, of adoption, and as the earnest, pledge, and seal of
their future glory. And since so it is, fornication, which makes them
one flesh with an harlot, ought studiously to be abstained from.

[1 Corinthians 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co1 6:18</span></span>

Flee fornication,.... As that which is hurtful, scandalous, and
unbecoming Christians; avoid it, and all the occasions of it, that may
lead unto it, and be incentives of it:

every sin that a man doth is without the body not but that other sins
are committed by the body, and by the members of it as instruments; they
are generally committed by the abuse of other things that are without,
and do not belong to the body; and so do not bring that hurt unto and
reproach upon the body, as fornication does:

but he that committeth fornication, sinneth against his own body; not
meaning his wife, which is as his own body; but his proper natural body,
which is not only the instrument by which this sin is committed, but the
object against which it is committed; and which is defiled and
dishonoured by it; and sometimes its strength and health are impaired,
and it is filled with nauseous diseases hereby.

[1 Corinthians 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co1 6:19</span></span>

What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost,....
What is said in [Co1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#016.md) of the
saints in general, is here said of their bodies in particular. The Holy
Spirit, in regeneration and sanctification, when he begins the good work
of grace on a man, takes possession of his whole person, soul and body,
and dwells therein as in his temple. So the Jews (o) call the body of a
righteous man the "habitation" of the Holy Spirit. Now it is most
abominably scandalous and shameful that that body, which is the dwelling
place of the Holy Spirit, which is sacred to him as a temple, should be
defiled by the sin of fornication: it is added,

which is in you, which ye have of God; meaning the Holy Spirit which was
in them, as in his temple; which dwelt in their hearts, and influenced
their bodies, lives, and conversations; and which they received of God
as a wonderful instance of his grace and love to them; that he should be
bestowed upon them, to regenerate, renew, and sanctify them, to implant
every grace, to make them a fit habitation for God, and meet for the
inheritance of the saints in light:

and ye are not your own: their own masters, at their own dispose, to
live to their own lusts, or the lusts of men; men have not power over
their bodies to abuse them at pleasure by fornication, or such like
uncleanness, neither single nor married persons; see [Co1
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#004.md) and of all men, not the saints,
who are neither their own nor other men's, nor Satan's, but God's; not
only by creation, but by choice and covenant; and Christ's by gift, by
purchase, and powerful grace, and in a conjugal relation to him;
wherefore fornication ill becomes them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co1 6:20</span></span>

For ye are bought with a price,.... Not with gold and silver, but with
the precious blood of Christ, as the whole church, and all the elect of
God are. This proves them to be the Lord's, not only his redeemed ones,
being ransomed by a price from the bondage of the law, sin, Satan, and
the world; but his espoused ones, and which is chiefly designed here;
for one way of obtaining and espousing a wife among the Jews was by a
price (p);

"a woman (they say) is obtained or espoused three ways; "by silver", by
a writing, and by lying with; by silver, the house of Shammai say, by a
penny, and the value of a penny; the house of Hillel say, by a "pruta",
and the value of a "pruta": how much is a "pruta?" the eighth part of an
Italian farthing.''

That is, be it ever so small a price, yet if given and taken on the
account of espousals, it made them valid; and it was an ancient rite in
marriage used among other nations (q) for husband and wife to buy each
other: Christ, indeed, did not purchase his church to be his spouse, but
because she was so; but then his purchasing of her with his blood more
clearly demonstrated and confirmed his right unto her, as his spouse; he
betrothed her to himself in eternity, in the everlasting covenant of
grace; but she, with the rest of the individuals of human nature, fell
into sin, and so, under the sentence of the law, into the hands of
Satan, and the captivity of the world; to redeem her from whence, and by
so doing to own and declare her his spouse, and his great love to her,
he gave himself a ransom price for her; which lays her under the
greatest obligation to preserve an inviolable chastity to him, and to
love and honour him.

Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's;
by "God" is here meant more especially the Lord Jesus Christ, by the
price of whose blood the bodies and souls of his people are bought,
which lays the obligation on them to glorify him in and with both; and
contains a very considerable proof of the deity of Christ; who is
"glorified", when all the perfections of the divine nature are ascribed
to him; when the whole of salvation is attributed to him, and he is
looked unto, received, trusted in and depended on as a Saviour, and
praise and thanks are given unto him on that account; and when his
Gospel is embraced and professed, and walked worthy of, and his
ordinances submitted to, and his commandments kept in love to him: and
he is to be glorified both in body and spirit; "in body", by an outward
attendance on his worship, and a becoming external conversation; by
confessing and speaking well of him; by acting for him, laying out and
using time, strength, and substance, for his honour and interest; and by
patient suffering for his name's sake: "in spirit", which is done when
the heart or spirit is given up to him, and is engaged in his service,
and when his glory lies near unto it; the reason enforcing all this, is
because both are his; not only by creation, but by his Father's gift of
both unto him; by his espousal of their whole persons to himself; and by
his redemption of both soul and body from destruction: the Vulgate
version reads, "bear" or "carry God in your body", and leaves out the
next words, "and in your spirit", which are God's; and which also are
left out in the Ethiopic and in the Alexandrian copy, and some others.
