### [3 John Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#001.md)

[3 John 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jo3 1:1</span></span>

The elder unto the well beloved Gaius,.... The elder is the writer of
the epistle, the Apostle John, who so styles himself on account of his
age, and office, as in the preceding epistle. The person to whom he
writes is "the well beloved Gaius"; not that Gaius, who was the Apostle
Paul's host, [Rom 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#023.md), for though
their characters agree, being both hospitable men, yet neither the place
nor time in which they lived. The Apostle Paul's Gaius lived at Corinth,
this is in some place near to Ephesus, for the apostle in his old age
purposed to come and see him shortly; the other was contemporary with
Paul, this with John; there were thirty or forty years difference
between them: besides, the Corinthian Gaius was baptized by Paul, and
was doubtless one of his spiritual children, or converts, whereas this
Gaius was one of the Apostle John's spiritual children, [Jo3
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#004.md); nor does he seem to be the same
with Gaius of Macedonia, [Act 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#029.md),
or with Gaius of Derbe, [Act 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004.md), who
seem to be two different persons by their country, though both
companions in travel of the Apostle Paul; for which reason, as well as
the time of their living, neither of them can be this Gaius, who was a
settled housekeeper, and resided at some certain place. His name is a
Roman name, and the same with Caius, though he seems to have been a Jew,
as he might, it being usual with the Jews in other countries to take
Gentile names. His character is, that he was "well beloved"; that is, of
God, as it appears he was from the grace bestowed on him, from the
prosperous estate of his soul, and from the truth that was in him, and
his walking in it; and of the Lord Jesus Christ, for the same reasons;
and also of all the brethren and saints that knew him; he being a person
not only truly gracious, and of faithfulness and integrity, but of great
liberality and beneficence, which must gain him much love and esteem
among them; and he was well beloved by the Apostle John; and so the
Syriac version renders it, "to my beloved Gaius": though his love to him
is expressed in the following clause,

whom I love in the truth; as being in it, or for the sake of it, or
truly and sincerely; See Gill on [Jo2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#001.md).

[3 John 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jo3 1:2</span></span>

Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper,.... Or
succeed in all temporal affairs, in the business of life, in which he
was; and as success of this sort depends upon the blessing of God, which
maketh rich, it is to be wished and prayed for from him:

and be in health; that is, of body, which above all things above all
outward mercies, is the most desirable; for without this, what are the
richest dainties, the largest possessions, or the best of friends?
without this there can be no comfortable enjoyment of either of them;
and therefore of this sort of mercies, it is in the first place, and
above all others, to be wished for, and desired by one friend for
another. The rule and measure of this wish is according to the
prosperity of his soul,

even as thy soul prospereth: the soul is diseased with sin, and may be
said to be in good health, when all its iniquities are forgiven; and may
be said to prosper, when having a spiritual appetite for the Gospel, the
sincere milk of the word, it feeds upon it, is nourished by it, and
grows thereby; when it is in the lively exercise of faith, hope, and
love; when spiritual knowledge is increased, or it grows in grace, and
in the knowledge of Christ Jesus; when the inward man is renewed day by
day with fresh strength; and when it enjoys communion with God, has the
light of his countenance, and the joys of his salvation; and when it is
fruitful in every good work.

[3 John 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jo3 1:3</span></span>

For I rejoiced greatly when the brethren came,.... From the place where
Gaius lived, to that where John now resided; these brethren seem to be
preachers of the word, who travelled from place to place to spread the
Gospel:

and testified of the truth that is in thee; either of Christ, who was
formed in him; or of the Gospel, which had a place in his heart; or of
the truth of grace that was in him, as well as of that faithfulness,
integrity, and sincerity he appeared to be possessed of, being an
Israelite indeed, and without guile:

even as thou walkest in the truth: in Christ, and in the Gospel, and as
became it, and with all uprightness; see [Jo2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#004.md); and this occasioned great joy in
the apostle; as it is matter of joy to every one that truly loves
Christ, and his Gospel; or has the true grace of charity in him, which
envies not the gifts and graces of others, but rejoiceth in the truth,
wherever it is found; and especially to the faithful ministers of the
word, when they hear of the truth of grace in any souls, and that such
continue walking in the truth of the Gospel, and particularly those who
have been wrought upon under their ministry, as follows.

[3 John 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jo3 1:4</span></span>

I have no greater joy,.... Nothing that causes greater joy. The Vulgate
Latin version reads "grace" or "thanks"; and then the sense is, that he
had nothing to be more thankful for:

than to hear that my children walk in truth; meaning his spiritual
children, those whose conversion he had been the instrument of; and
among these it seems Gaius was one.

[3 John 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jo3 1:5</span></span>

Beloved, thou doest faithfully,.... Or a faithful thing, and as became a
faithful man, a believer in Christ; in all his beneficence and charity
he acted the upright part; he did not do it in an hypocritical way, to
be seen of men, and gain applause from them, but from a principle of
love, and with a view to the glory of God:

whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers; which may
design either different persons; and by "brethren" may be meant the poor
brethren of the church that. Gaius belonged to, and others that were
well known to him; and by "the strangers", not unconverted persons, but
such of the saints as came from foreign parts, and travelled about to
spread the Gospel, and enlarge the interest of Christ: or else the same
persons may be intended, for the words may be read, as they are in the
Alexandrian copy, and some others, and in the Vulgate Latin version,
"what thou doest to the brethren, and this to strangers"; that is, as
the Arabic version renders it, "to strange brethren"; or, as the Syriac
version, "to the brethren, and especially them that are strangers"; so
that Gaius was a very hospitable man, one that entertained and lodged
strangers, and used them very civilly and courteously, with great
liberality, and with much integrity and sincerity.

[3 John 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jo3 1:6</span></span>

Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church,.... At
Ephesus, where John was; these brethren and strangers coming thither,
and being greatly affected with Gaius's kindness and liberality to them,
could not forbear speaking of it to his praise, in the presence of the
members of the church, as well as acquainted the Apostle John with it;
the Syriac version reads, "before the whole church"; they bore testimony
of his liberality in a very public manner And this the apostle mentions
to encourage Gaius to go on, and continue in his kindness to the same
persons, since they retained such a grateful sense of past favours; and
whereas they were now returning back, he desires that he would give them
some further assistance:

whom if thou bring forward on their journey; the word here used
signifies, to send on before, as in [Act
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#003.md), and is used by the Septuagint in
the same sense as here, and in the above places, in [Gen
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#016.md); where it is said, that "Abraham
went with them (the angels) to bring them on in the way", "to send them
on", or "send them away"; dismiss them, take his leave of them in a
friendly and honourable way. The Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan render
it, "to accompany them"; and so this Greek word, which seems to answer
to the Hebrew phrase, signifies an honourable accompanying, leading
forth, and taking leave of friends; and so the apostle encourages Gaius
to behave in like manner to the brethren and strangers; meaning, either
by accompanying them in person, or by sending his servants along with
them, both to direct them the way, and to secure them from danger, and
chiefly by furnishing them with everything necessary for them; see [Tit
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#013.md). And this he would have him do,

after a godly sort; or "worthy of God"; in imitation of God, who is
merciful, kind, and beneficent; or as it became him whom God had called
by his grace to his kingdom and glory; or as it was fit and proper such
servants of God, as those brethren were, should be used; and this would
be doing well:

thou shalt do well; what is grateful and well pleasing to God, and
beautiful and lovely in the eyes of his people.

[3 John 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jo3 1:7</span></span>

Because that for his name's sake they went forth,.... From Judea; either
of their own accord to preach the Gospel, or being drove out by the
unbelieving Jews, for professing the name of Christ; and be it which it
will, there was good reason why they should be regarded, and especially
since they did as follows,

taking nothing of the Gentiles; even of those who were converted, though
their preaching the Gospel, to whom they ministered, for of others, the
unconverted Gentiles, they could not expect to receive; and this they
did, as the apostles before them, because they would not be chargeable
to them, and lest it should be thought they sought their own worldly
interest, and not the good of souls and glory of Christ, and so a
stumblingblock be laid in the way of the Gospel, to hinder the progress
of it. The Ethiopic version reads this in the singular number, "and I
went forth for his name's sake, taking nothing of the Gentiles".

[3 John 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jo3 1:8</span></span>

We therefore ought to receive such,.... We who are Jews, that have
believed in Christ, for such an one Gaius, it seems, as well, as the
apostle, were, ought to receive such preachers of the word into our
houses, and entertain them cheerfully, while they continue, and supply
them with all necessaries when they depart:

that we might be fellow helpers to the truth; that is, to the Gospel,
and the propagation of it in the world: some are helpers to it, in
preaching of it, by making use of the ministerial gifts bestowed upon
them; and others are fellow helpers with them, to the same good work, by
their purses, communicating freely to the support of those, who labour
in the word and doctrine; and these latter have the honour to be
co-workers, or fellow labourers with the former, as the word here used
signifies. The Alexandrian copy reads, "fellow helpers to the church",
that so the whole burden of taking care of these ministers might not lie
upon them. The Vulgate Latin, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions read,
"fellow helpers of the truth".

[3 John 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jo3 1:9</span></span>

I wrote unto the church,.... Where Gaius was a member: those who take
Gaius to be the same with Paul's host, and whom he baptized at Corinth,
think the church at Corinth is here meant; but it seems rather to be
meant of some church in Asia nearer Ephesus; nor is it likely that
John's first epistle should be here intended, which makes no mention of
relieving the brethren, the ministers of the Gospel, that came from
Judea: and that this epistle should not be preserved, need not seem
strange; for it cannot be thought that everything that was written by
him to particular persons, or churches, should be continued. The
Alexandrian copy and one of Stephens's read, "I wrote something to the
church"; upon this head, concerning receiving and supporting ministers
of the Gospel, and so prevents an objection that Gaius might make, why
did he not write to the church about it? The Vulgate Latin version
reads, "I should", or "would have wrote": and the Syriac version, "I
desired", or "wished to have wrote"; suggesting, that though he had not
wrote, yet it was much upon his mind, he had a great desire to it:

but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them,

receiveth us not; which hindered him from writing, or was the reason why
he wrote now to Gaius since Diotrephes gave no heed to what he had
wrote, suppressed his letter, and would not suffer it to be read to the
brethren. This Diotrephes, by his name, which signifies one "nourished",
or "brought up by Jupiter", was a Gentile; there was one of this name,
who was one of the kings of Athens (a); and what may confirm this is,
his slighting and rejecting the brethren that came from Judea: it is
very likely he was more than a private member in the church, and that he
was an officer, and it may be the pastor; and though there is a
preeminence, which of right belongs to such an officer, as to preside
over the church, to govern, guide, and direct, according to the laws of
Christ, he being set over the church, as a ruler, governor, and guide;
yet this may be carried too far, as it was by this man, who coveted more
than was his due, and lorded it over God's heritage, ruled the flock
with force and cruelty, and usurped a tyrannical power over them;
whereas every thing in a church ought to be done, by pastor and people,
in love, meekness, and with mutual consent. And it may be also, that he
sought to have the preeminence over the rest of the elders of the
church, for in those large churches there were oftentimes more elders
and pastors than one; see [Act 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#017.md).
This ambitious spirit prevailed and obtained among the false teachers,
who set up themselves at the head of parties, and above the apostles of
Christ, and paved the way for antichrist, who assumed the title of
universal bishop, which has introduced all the errors and impieties of
the Romish church. Now this man such an ambitious, lordly, and governing
spirit, received not the Apostle John, and those that were with him;
meaning not their persons, for as yet he and they were not in person
where he was; but his letter, his orders, and instructions; these he
paid no regard to, concealed them from the church, and would not admit
them to be read: or else the apostle's sense is, that he received not
the brethren that came from him, and were recommended by him, and whom
he affectionately loved, and who were near and dear to him as himself;
and therefore not receiving them is interpreted by him as not receiving
himself.

[3 John 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jo3 1:10</span></span>

Wherefore, if I come,.... Where both Gaius and Diotrephes lived, as he
trusted he should shortly, [Jo3 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#014.md);

I will remember his deeds which he doth; meaning, not only that he would
tell him of them to his face, but make mention of them, and expose them
to the whole church, and reprove him for them: and which are as follow,

prating against us with malicious words; it is a common thing for
ministers of the Gospel to be prated against, not only by the men of the
world, but by professors of religion, and by such who call themselves
preachers also; nor need it be wondered at, since John, an apostle of
Christ, the beloved disciple, who was so harmless and inoffensive in his
conversation, so kind and loving in his disposition and temper, so meek
and humble in his deportment, and now in such an advanced age, was
prated against by a Diotrephes: and what is said against Christ's
ministers is no other than prating; silly, idle, trifling, and empty
stuff, as the word used signifies; for want of greater things, they take
up any little matter, and improve it against them; and this is often
done with a malicious intent, to hurt their characters, spoil their
usefulness, and render their ministry unprofitable.

And not content herewith; with prating against the Apostle John, and the
ministers with him, in this wicked way:

neither doth he himself receive the brethren; the meaning is not, that
he did not receive them into the church, for they were there, since
afterwards mention is made of his casting them out from thence; but he
did not receive them into his house, and entertain them as he ought to
have done; for a minister of the Gospel, and a pastor of a church, ought
to be hospitable, and given to hospitality, and entertain strangers,
especially those who are brethren in Christ, and fellow ministers of the
word: and the rather these were to be received, since they travelled
about to spread the Gospel among the Gentiles, and took nothing of them.
And this was not all, he not only did not receive them himself, and
reject them, but was not willing that others should receive them:

and forbiddeth them that would; on such who had a heart, as well as
ability, to receive and entertain these poor brethren, he laid his
injunctions, and gave them strict orders, in his lordly and tyrannical
way, not to show any respect unto them;

and casteth them out of the church; that is, he excommunicated them,
either those that entertained them, or rather the brethren themselves;
which was an abuse of the ordinance of excommunication, as that
ordinance is abused, when any single person, a pastor, or any other, as
here, assumes the power of doing it himself, and does it without the
church; whereas it is a punishment or censure, to be inflicted by many,
or to be done by the joint suffrage of the church; and when it is done
in a wrong cause, for some small trifling matter, or none at all, and
not in a case of heresy or immorality, obstinately persisted in; and
when it is done from wrong principles, and with wrong ends, as to
gratify the pride and passion of some; and not for the good of the
person cast out, or to prevent others from falling into the same snare,
or for the honour of religion, and the glory of God. The phrase seems to
be taken from the Jews, who expressed their excommunication, or putting
out of the synagogue, by a casting out; see [Joh
9:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#034.md).

[3 John 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jo3 1:11</span></span>

Beloved, follow not that which is evil,.... Follow not evil in general,
it being hateful to God, contrary to his nature and will, and bad in
itself, as well as pernicious in its consequences; and particularly
follow not, or do not imitate the particular evil or evils in
Diotrephes; as his pride, ambition, love of preeminence, and tyrannical
government in the church, and especially his hard heartedness, cruelty,
and inhospitality to the poor saints; and so the Arabic version reads,
"do not imitate him in evil"; the examples of persons in office and
authority have great influence, especially in cases of charity, when men
can be excused thereby, and save their money, or be freed from an
expense:

but that which is good; follow and imitate that, be a follower of God,
imitate him in acts of kindness and beneficence, be merciful as he is;
copy the deeds of Jesus Christ, who went about doing good, and declared
it to be more blessed to give than to receive; and tread in the steps of
those good men, who have shown love to the name of Christ, by
ministering to his saints; for though the apostle may mean everything
that is good, which is to be followed and imitated in any, yet he
chiefly designs acts of kindness and beneficence to poor saints and
ministers: to which he encourages by the following,

he that doeth good is of God; he is a child of God, he appears to be so,
in that he is like to his heavenly Father, who is kind and merciful; he
is born of God, he is passed from death to life, which his love to the
brethren shows; he has the grace of God, and strength from Christ, and
the assistance of the Spirit, without either of which he could not do
that which is good:

but he that doeth evil hath not seen God; has had no spiritual saving
sight of God in Christ; for if he had, he would abhor that which is
evil, and, with Job, abhor himself for it, and reckon himself, with
Isaiah, as undone, [Job 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#006.md), for such
effects has the sight of God on the souls of men; such an one knows not
God, nor what it is to have communion with him: for those who live in
sin, in whom it is a governing principle, cannot have fellowship with
God; nor has such an one ever felt the love of God in his soul, or been
made a partaker of his grace, which would teach and constrain him to act
otherwise. Compare this text with [Jo1
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#010.md), which shows the Apostle John to
be the writer of this epistle. The Ethiopic version reads, "shall not
see God"; that is, hereafter, in the world to come.

[3 John 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jo3 1:12</span></span>

Demetrius hath good report of all men, This man was of a quite different
cast from Diotrephes, and therefore the apostle makes mention of him to
Gaius, to be followed by him, and not the other; he was either the same
with Demas, which is a contraction of this name, or the person that John
sent from Ephesus with this letter: we read of an Ephesian of this name,
[Act 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#024.md); though not the same
person; or else one that also was a member of the same church with Gaius
and Diotrephes; and he being kind and beneficent, obtained a good report
of the generality of men, not only of the brethren, but of those that
were without; for a liberal man is universally respected. The Syriac
version adds, "and of the church itself"; as distinct from all men, or
the generality of the men of the world:

and of the truth itself; that is, whoever speaks truth must give him a
good character, for this cannot be understood with any propriety of the
Gospel, nor of Jesus Christ:

yea, and we also bear record; or a testimony to the character of
Demetrius; that is, I, John, the apostle, and the saints at Ephesus:

and ye know that our record is true; faithful, and to be depended upon.
The Alexandrian copy, and several others, read, "thou knowest", as does
also the Vulgate Latin version, which seems most agreeable, since this
epistle is directed to a single person; compare this with [Joh
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#035.md); and it will give a further
proof of this epistle being the Apostle John's.

[3 John 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jo3 1:13</span></span>

I have many things to write,.... With regard to churches, and particular
persons, and concerning hospitality to the poor brethren:

but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee; suggesting he should
take another method of communicating his mind to him, which he next
mentions.

[3 John 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jo3 1:14</span></span>

But I trust I shall shortly see thee,.... Either at Ephesus, where John
was, or rather at the place where Gaius lived, see [Jo3
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#010.md);

and we shall speak face to face; freely and familiarly converse together
about these things, which were not thought proper to be committed to
writing:

peace be to thee; which was the usual form of salutation with the Jews,
and John was one; See Gill on [Joh
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019.md);

our friends salute thee; or send their Christian salutation to thee,
wishing all health and prosperity in soul and body; meaning the members
of the church at Ephesus: the Arabic version reads, "thy friends"; such
at Ephesus as had a particular knowledge of him, and affection for him.
The Vulgate Latin version reads, "the friends": the members in general;
and the Alexandrian copy reads, "the brethren"; and the Syriac version,
our brethren: and then the epistle is closed thus,

greet the friends by name; meaning those that were where Gaius lived, to
whom the apostle sends his salutation, and desires it might be delivered
to each of them, as if they had been mentioned by name. This and the
epistle of James are the only epistles which are concluded without the
word "Amen".
