### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ecc 8:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO ECCLESIASTES 8

The preacher begins this chapter with the praise of wisdom, from its
excellency and usefulness, [Ecc 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#001.md);
and advises men, if they would live quietly and comfortably, to honour
and obey the king that rules over them, and not be rebellious against
him, since he has great power and authority, [Ecc
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#002.md); and not be anxious about things
to come, since there is a set time for everything, and future things
cannot be known nor frustrated; and, particularly, there is no avoiding
the hour and stroke of death, [Ecc
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#006.md); Though there are times wherein
wicked men rule over others, it is to their own hurt, and they must die;
and though they may be pompously buried, yet are soon forgotten, [Ecc
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#009.md); and the reason of their insolence
is the delay of justice; yet there will come a time when it shall be
well with them that fear God, and ill with the wicked, though they may
live long in wickedness; and for the present it may befall good then
what wicked men deserve, and wicked men may have that which might, be
thought more proper for good men, [Ecc
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011.md); wherefore this should give no
uneasiness; but men should cheerfully and freely enjoy what they have
with thankfulness, there being nothing better than that under the sun,
[Ecc 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#015.md); and the chapter is
concluded with observing the unsearchableness of divine Providence, [Ecc
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#016.md).

[Ecclesiastes 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 8:1</span></span>

Who is as the wise man?.... Who is as the first man, that was made
upright, and was a wise man? not one of his sons. Or who is as the wise
man, meaning himself? no man; he was the wisest of men; and yet he could
not find out wisdom, and the reason of things, and the wickedness of
folly, [Ecc 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#025.md); how therefore should
any other man? what can the man do that comes after the king? Or who is
like to a wise man, to he compared to him for honour and dignity? none;
not those of the highest birth and blood, of the greatest wealth and
riches, or in the highest places of power and authority; a wise man is
above them, they being without wisdom; and especially such as are wise
to salvation; these are the excellent in the earth, and the most worthy
among men. Or who is a truly wise man? is there really such a person in
the world, that has got to the perfection of wisdom? not one; and very
few they are that can, in a true and proper sense, be called wise men.
The Targum is,

"who is a wise man, that can stand against the wisdom of the Lord?''

and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? or "a word" (q)? the word
of God, which is not of private interpretation? none know it rightly,
but such who have the Spirit of God, the enditer of the word: Christ is
the interpreter, one among a thousand; and, next to him are those who
have his mind, and rightly divide the word of truth. The Targum is,

"and to know the interpretation of the words in the prophets:''

this may be understood of the solution of any difficulties in things
natural or civil; and of the interpretation of any of the works of God,
either in nature or providence, as well as of his word; and he is a wise
man, that not only has wisdom in himself, but is able to teach others,
and make them wise; can solve doubts, remove difficulties, interpret
nature, the works and word of God. Aben Ezra repeats the note of
similitude from the former clause, and so it may be rendered, "Who is as
he that knows the interpretation of a thing", or "word?" such an one as
Solomon was, [Pro 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#006.md);

a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine: as Moses, when he came down
from the mount, full fraught with the knowledge of the will of God, [Exo
34:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#029.md); and as Stephen, whose wisdom
and spirit, by which he spoke, were irresistible, [Act
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#010.md); wisdom, which discovers itself
in a man's words and actions, gives comeliness to his person, makes him
look amiable and lovely in the eyes of others: or, it "enlightens his
face" (r); by it he is able to see the difference between truth and
falsehood, and what is to be done and not done; what way he should walk
in, and what he should shun and avoid;

and the boldness of his face shall be changed; the ferocity and
austerity of his countenance, the impudence and inhumanity that appeared
in him before, through his wisdom and knowledge, are changed into
meekness, gentleness, and humanity; of an impudent, fierce, and badly
behaved man, he becomes meek, modest, affable, and humane; this effect
natural wisdom and knowledge has on men (s); and much more spiritual and
evangelical wisdom, which comes from above, and is first pure, then
peaceable and gentle, [Jam 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#017.md). Some
read it, "the strength of his face shall be doubled", or "renewed" (t);
he shall be changed into the same image, from glory to glory; his
spiritual strength shall be renewed, and his light and knowledge
increase yet more and more, [Co2 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#018.md).
But Gussetius (u) renders it, his "boldness", or impudence, "shall be
hated".

[Ecclesiastes 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 8:2</span></span>

I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment,.... Or, "to observe the
mouth of the king" (w); what he says, and do according to it when it is
agreeably to the law of God, and according to the laws of the kingdom,
by which he is to govern; for kings are to be honoured, obeyed, and
submitted to, in the lawful discharge of their office: and such counsel
and advice as this is wholesome; and, being taken, contributes much, as
to the honour of kings, so to the good of kingdoms and states, and to a
man's own peace and comfort. Aben Ezra supplies it,

"I command thee, or I admonish thee;''

for it may be either a charge, or art advice, respecting this and what
follows. Jarchi supplies and paraphrases it thus,

"I have need, and am prepared, to observe the mouth (or keep the
commandment) of the King of the world;''

and so Alshech,

"observe that which goes out of the mouth of the King of the world.''

And indeed, to understand it, not of an earthly king, but of the King of
kings, as it is understood by other interpreters also, suits better with
what is said of this King in the following verses; whose commandments,
which are not grievous, but to be loved above fine gold, should be kept
from a principle of love, without mercenary and selfish views, as they
are delivered out by him, and to his glory; and such a charge as this
should be attended to, and such counsel be received;

and that in regard of the oath of God; who has swore, that if his
children forsake his law, and walk not in his statutes, he will visit
their transgressions with a rod, and their iniquities with stripes; and
therefore should be careful to keep his commandments, [Psa
89:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#030.md). Those who interpret this of an
earthly king, by the oath of God understand the oath of allegiance and
fidelity to him, taken in the name and presence of God, and therefore
for conscience's sake should obey him: or render it, "but so that thou
observest the manner of the oath of God" (x); or takest care to obey
him; or do nothing in obedience to kings, which is contrary to the will
of God; for God is to be obeyed rather than men, [Act
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#019.md); especially, and above all
things, that is to be regarded.

"observa", Montanus, Vatablus, Junius & Tremellius, Piscator, Cocceius,
Gejerus, Rambachius. (x) "sed, ita quod ad Deum attinent, observes
rationem juramenti Dei", Varenius; "attamen, supra serve verbum
juramenti Dei", Gussetius, p. 605.

[Ecclesiastes 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 8:3</span></span>

Be not hasty to go out of his sight,.... But of the sight of the King of
kings. Do not think to hide thyself from him, for there is no fleeing
from his presence, [Psa 139:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#007.md); it is
best, when under some consternation, as the word (y) signifies, or under
some fearful apprehension of his wrath and indignation, to fall down
before him, acknowledge the offence, and pray for pardon: and to this
purpose is the Targum,

"and in the time of the indignation of the Lord, do not cease to pray
before him; being terrified (or troubled) before him, go and pray, and
seek mercy of him;''

and with which agrees the note of Jarchi,

"be not troubled, saying that thou wilt go and free from his presence,
to a place where he does not rule, for he rules in every place.''

Such who interpret this of an earthly king suppose this forbids a man
going out from the presence of a king in a pet and passion, withdrawing
himself from his court and service in a heat, at once;

stand not in an evil thing; having done it, continue not in it; but
repent of it, acknowledge and forsake it, whether against God or an
earthly king;

for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him; which best agrees with the King of
kings, who does what he pleases, in heaven above and in earth below,
both in nature, providence, and grace; see [Job
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#013.md); though earthly kings indeed
have long hands, as is usually said, and can reach a great way, and do
great things, especially despotic and arbitrary princes, and it is very
difficult escaping their hands. The Targum is,

"for the Lord of all worlds, the Lord will do what he pleases.''

\(y\) "ne consterneris", Gejerus, and some in Rambachius.

[Ecclesiastes 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 8:4</span></span>

Where the word of a king is, there is power,.... Or "dominion" (z).
Authority goes along with his word of command; and there is an inferior
magistracy, a subordinate power under him, ready to execute his will
upon the rebellious and disobedient. Jarchi interprets it, the word of
the holy blessed God; and the Targum, the word of that King who rules
over all the world; where his word of doctrine comes, not in word only,
it is with power: his written word is quick and powerful; the word of
his Gospel preached is the power of God to salvation; or is accompanied
with power to enlighten dark minds, quicken dead sinners, unstop deaf
ears, soften hard hearts, and deliver men from the slavery of sin and
Satan; it makes men, of enemies, friends to God, Christ, and good men;
transforms them by the renewing of their minds, and comforts and
establishes saints; all which is attributed to the word; and are the
effects of almighty power, [Heb 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012.md);
his word of command also comes with power, being clothed with his
authority; and is submitted to by his people in the day of his power
upon them, who readily and cheerfully obey it;

and who may say unto him, what dost thou? call him to an account for, or
complain of any of his works of creation, providence, or grace? This
best agrees with God than with an earthly king; and is said of him
elsewhere, [Job 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#012.md).

\(z\) "imperium", Montanus, Rambachius; "dominatio", Vatablus, Junius &
Tremellius, Piscator, Drusius.

[Ecclesiastes 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 8:5</span></span>

Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing,.... Either the
commandment of an earthly king, which should be kept, when agreeably to
the laws of the nation, and not inconsistent with the commands of God;
and such as do observe it "know no evil" (a), as it may be rendered, or
no sorrow; they live peaceably and quietly, and enjoy the favour and
protection of the government under which they are, and have praise of
men; see [Rom 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#003.md); or the
commandments of the heavenly King, the singular being put for the
plural; so the Targum,

"whoso keepeth the commandments of the Lord shall know no evil in the
world to come.''

Nor in this world neither; no evil befalls them; what may be thought to
be so is for their good; though they know and are conscious of the evil
of sin, and commit it, yet not willingly, and with love to it, and so as
to make it the work of their lives; but lament it, repent of it, and
forsake it, and do not feel the evil of punishment for it; yea, such
enjoy much good; have much communion with God; large discoveries of his
love; dwell in him, and shall at last dwell with him in the heavenly
city; see [Joh 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#021.md);

and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment; he knows not
only what is his duty to do, both with respect to God and men, to a
temporal prince or the King eternal; but he knows also the most fit and
convenient time of doing it; and lays hold on every opportunity that
offers, and which may be called "redeeming time", [Gal
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#010.md); and he knows the right manner in
which it should be performed, with all the agreeable circumstances of
it, which he carefully observes; or he knows the judgment that will be
passed, or the punishment that will be inflicted on delinquents, either
by God or men; and therefore is careful to keep the commandment, and
avoid it: and especially he remembers there is a judgment to come, when
everything will be brought to an account; and, though he does not know
the precise day and hour, yet he knows there will be such a time; so
some render it, "the time of judgment" (b): the Targum is,

"and the time of prayer, and of judgment, and of truth, is known by the
heart of the wise.''

\(a\) "non cognoscet", Vatablus, Mercerus, Gejerus, Rambachius,
Cocceius. (b) , Sept. so some in Drusius.

[Ecclesiastes 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 8:6</span></span>

Because to every purpose there is time and judgment,.... There is a fit
season, and a right and proper manner of doing everything that is to be
done; see [Ecc 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#001.md); which a wise man
discerns; and which when a man hits upon, it prevents a great deal of
mischief, which for want of it comes upon men, as the following clause
shows; some refer this to the punishment of the wicked, and to a future
judgment. So the Targum,

"to every business there is a time good and evil, and according to the
judgment of truth the whole world is judged;''

and to the same purpose Jarchi,

"there is a time fixed for the visitation of the wicked, and there is
judgment before the Lord; this is vengeance or punishment;''

therefore the misery of man is great upon him; he not observing the
right time and manner of doing what he ought, brings much trouble upon
himself; his days are few and full trouble, and every day has a
sufficiency of evil in because of the evil of sin, the evil of misery
presses upon him, and is a heavy burden on him Jarchi's note is,

"when the wickedness of a man is great, then cometh his visitation.''

[Ecclesiastes 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 8:7</span></span>

For he knoweth not that which shall be,.... Or that "it shall be" (b);
that he ever shall have the opportunity again he has lost, nor what is
to come hereafter; what shall be on the morrow, or what shall befall him
in the remaining part of his days; what troubles and sorrows he shall
meet with, or what will be the case and circumstances of his family
after his death;

for who can tell him when it shall be? or "how it shall be" (c)? how it
will be with him or his; no one that pretends to judicial astrology, or
to the art of divination, or any such devices, can tell him what is to
come; future things are only certainly known by God; none but he can
tell what will certainly come to pass; see [Ecc
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#022.md); Jarchi interprets it of a man's
not considering for what God will bring him to judgment, and that no man
can tell him the vengeance and punishment that will be inflicted.

\(b\) "quod futurum est", Pagninus, Montanus. (c) "quo modo", Junius &
Tremellius, Gejerus, Rambachius, so Broughton.

[Ecclesiastes 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 8:8</span></span>

There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the
spirit,.... Which is not to be understood of the wind, which the word
used sometimes signifies, and of men's having no power to restrain that,
or hinder it from blowing; for to what purpose should Solomon mention
this? rather it may be considered as a check upon despotic and arbitrary
princes not to stretch their power too far; since they had none over the
spirits or minds of men, and could not hinder them from thinking ill of
them, and wishing ill to them, nor restrain their hatred of them;
whatever power they had or exercised over their bodies and estates, they
had none over their spirits, or their consciences; no lawful power to
restrain them from their to God, nor to oblige them to do that which he
has forbidden; nor to compel them to anything against conscience; nor to
bind their consciences in matters indifferent: or as an argument with
subjects to obey the commands of their sovereign; since it is not in
their power to restrain the spirit and wrath of princes, which is as the
roaring of a lion, and as: he messengers of death, [Pro
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#014.md); particularly to be careful that
they do not commit any capital offence, for which sentence may be passed
to take away life; when it will not be in their power to retain it; nor
rescue themselves out of the hands of justice and the civil magistrate,
but must submit. Or else it is to be understood of every man's spirit at
the hour of death, and of the unavoidableness of it, as the next clause
explains it; and by "spirit" is meant, either the sensitive soul, the
same with the spirit of a beast, without which the body is dead, and is
like the wind that passeth away, and ceaseth when the breath is stopped;
or the rational soul, the spirit that is committed to God, and returns
to him at death, [Luk 23:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#043.md). This a
man has not power over to dismiss or retain at pleasure; he cannot keep
it one moment longer when it is called for and required by the Father of
spirits, the Creator of it; he has not power "to restrain" (d) it, as in
a prison, as the word signifies, as Alshech observes; whence Aben Ezra
says, that the spirit or soul in the body is like a prisoner in a
prison; but nothing, that attends a man in this life, or he is in
possession of, can keep the soul in this prison, when the time of its
departure is come; not riches, nor honours, nor wisdom and leaning, nor
strength and youth, nor all the force of medicine; the time is fixed, it
is the appointment of God, the bounds set by him cannot be passed, [Ecc
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#002.md), [Job
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#005.md). The Targum is,

"no man has power over the spirit of the soul to restrain the soul of
life, that it might not cease from the body of man;''

and to the same sense Jarchi,

"to restrain the spirit in his body, that the angel of death should not
take him;''

neither hath he power in the day of death; or "dominion" (e); death
strips a man of all power and authority, the power that the husband has
over the wife, or parents over their children, or the master over his
servant, or the king over his subjects; death puts down all power and
authority: it is an observation of Jarchi's, that David after he came to
the throne is everywhere called King David, but, when he came to die,
only David, [Kg1 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#001.md); no king nor
ruler can stand against death any more than a beggar; up man is lord of
death any more than of life, but death is lord of all; all must and do
submit to it, high and low, rich and poor; there is a day fixed for it,
and that day can never be adjourned, or put off to another; and as man
has not power to deliver himself in the day of death, so neither his
friend, as the Targum, nor any relation whatever;

and there is no discharge in that war; death is a warfare as well as
life, with which nature struggles, but in vain; it is an enemy, and the
last that shall be destroyed; it is a king, and a very powerful one;
there is no withstanding him, he is always victorious; and there is no
escaping the battle with him, or fleeing from him; a discharge of
soldiers in other wars is sometimes obtained by interest, by the
entreaty of friends, or by money; but here all cries and entreaties
signify nothing; nor does he value riches, gold, or all the forces of
strength; see [Sa2 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#018.md); under the
old law, if a person had built a new house, or married a wife, or was
faint hearted, he was excused and dismissed; but none of these things
are of any avail in this war, [Deu
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#005.md); captives taken in war are
sometimes dismissed by their conquerors, or they find ways and means to
make their escape; but nothing of this kind can be done when death has
seized on the persons of men. Some render it, there is "no sending to"
or "in that war" (f); there is no sending forces against death to
withstand him, it is to no purpose; there is no sending a message to him
to sue for a peace, truce, or reprieve; he will hearken to nothing;
there is no sending one in the room of another, as Jarchi observes,

"a man cannot say, I will send my son, or my servant;''

no surrogation is allowed of in this case, as David wished for, [Sa2
18:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#033.md). Aben Ezra interprets it, no
armour, and so many interpreters; and so the Targum;

"nor do instruments of armour help in war;''

in this war: in other wars a man may put on a helmet of brass and a coat
of mail, to protect and defend him, or throw darts and arrows; but these
signify nothing when death makes his approach and attack;

neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it; or "the
masters of it" (g); that is, from death; neither Satan the wicked one,
as Jerom, who is wickedness itself, and with whom wicked men are
confederate, can deliver them from death; nor sinners the most abandoned
deliver themselves, who have made a covenant with it, and an agreement
with hell, [Isa 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#015.md); such who are
masters of the greatest wicked craft and cunning, and who devise many
ways to escape other things, can contrive none to escape death; nor will
riches gotten by wickedness deliver the owners of them from death; see
[Pro 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#002.md); This sense is mentioned by
Aben Ezra, and not to be despised.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 8:9</span></span>

All this have I seen,.... Observed, taken notice of, and thoroughly
considered; all that is said above, concerning the scarcity of good men
and women, the fall of our first parents, the excellency of wisdom, the
necessity and advantage of keeping the king's commandment, the time and
manner of doing it, the evil consequences that follow an inattention to
these things, ignorance of what is to come, and the unavoidableness of
death;

and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun; not so
much to mechanic works and manual operations performed by men, as to
moral or immoral works, and chiefly the work of Providence with respect
to good and bad men, the consequence of which were the following
observations;

there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt; or
"the man ruleth over men" (h); for this is not to be understood of
private rule in families, of the parent over his children, or master
over his servant, but of a king over his subjects; who is the man, the
principal man in the kingdom; and such a man ruling in an arbitrary and
tyrannical way is to his own detriment in the issue. So Rehoboam; by his
oppressive government, lost ten tribes out of twelve. Some have lost
their whole kingdoms, and come to an untimely end; as well as ruined
their immortal souls. Some render it "to his hurt" (i); to the hurt of
those that are ruled, when it should be for their good, the protection
of their persons and properties; but instead of that they lay heavy
burdens upon them, take away their property, and injure and insult their
persons. So the Targum,

"to do ill to him.''

But Jarchi interprets it of the king himself. Some take it in both
senses; and so it is usually in fact, that wicked princes rule to their
own hurt, and the hurt of their subjects.

And so I saw the wicked buried,.... Or "truly" (k), verily, as the
Targum, this is matter of fact; or "then I saw", as Aben Ezra and
others, upon applying his heart to every work; or when be observed
particularly wicked magistrates, he took notice that some of them
continued in their power until death, and died in their beds, and were
carried to their graves in great pomp and state, and interred in a very
magnificent manner, when they deserved no burial at all, but, as King
Jeconiah, to be buried with the burial of an ass;

who had come and gone from the place of the holy; which most understand
of the same persons, of wicked magistrates buried, who kept their posts
of honour and places of power and authority as long as they lived; and
went to and came from the courts of judicature and tribunals of justice,
in great state and splendour; where they presided as God's vicegerents,
and therefore called the place of the holy, [Psa
82:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#001.md); or though they were sometimes
deposed, yet they were restored again to their former dignity; or though
they died and were buried, yet in a sense rose again in their children
that succeeded them, so Aben Ezra: but it seems better to understated it
of other persons, and render the, words thus, "and they came, and from
the place of the holy", or "the holy place they walked" (l); that is,
multitudes came to attend the funeral of such rich and mighty men, and
walked after or followed the corpse; and ever, the priests and Levites
from the temple made a part of the funeral procession, and walked in
great solemnity from thence to the place of interment, which was usually
without the city;

and they were forgotten in the city where they had done; all their evil
deeds were forgotten, their acts of oppression and injustice, as if they
had never been done by them. The Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions
are, "and they were praised in the city"; panegyrics upon them were
written and rehearsed, monuments were erected to their honour, with
large encomiums of them; and so it may be read by the change of a
letter; and Jarchi says, do not read "forgotten", but "praised"; and so
he says it is interpreted by their Rabbins. The whole may be considered
in a very different view thus "but then I saw", &c. such arbitrary
rulers die, and laid in the grave, one after another, and their names
have been buried in oblivion, and never remembered more in the city
where they have exercised so much power and authority. The latter part
of the text is by many understood of good men, and rendered thus, "and"
or "but on the contrary they were forgotten in the city where they had
done right" (m); their persons and their good deeds were remembered no
more; but this seems contrary to [Psa
112:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#006.md). The Targum paraphrases the
whole thus;

"and in truth I have seen sinners that are buried and destroyed out of
the world, from the holy place where the righteous dwell, who go to be
burned in hell; and they are forgotten among the inhabitants of the
city; and as they have done, it is done to them;''

this is also vanity; the pompous funeral of such wicked magistrates.

[Ecclesiastes 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 8:11</span></span>

Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily,.... Any
evil work done by magistrates, or others, against which the wrath of God
is revealed from heaven, and is threatened with his vengeance; the
decree is gone forth, the sentence is passed, God is determined upon
punishment; but there is a delay of it, he exercises patience and
longsuffering to answer some end of his, both towards his own people and
the wicked; as well as to display some of his own perfections; but
because so it is, the judgment comes not at once;

therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil;
or their "heart is full to do evil" (n); they have not only a fulness of
sin in them naturally as is in every man's heart; but they are filled
with resolution, boldness, and courage, to commit sin, promising
themselves impurity from the seeming delay of justice; such an abuse do
they make of the patience and forbearance of God; they become more and
more hardened in sin and bent upon the commission of it.

[Ecclesiastes 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 8:12</span></span>

Though a sinner do evil an hundred times,.... That is ever so many
times, a certain number for an uncertain; though he lives in a continued
course of sin, being resolved upon the above consideration to give
himself a swing to his lusts. The Targum renders it a hundred years;
though be should live so long in sin, yet at last should be accursed
[Isa 65:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#020.md). This and what follows are
said to check the boldness and presumption of the sinner upon the
patience of God; and to make the people of God easy under the delay of
justice, and the prosperity of the wicked;

and his days be prolonged: or rather, "and he prolongs unto him" (o);
that is, God prolongs unto him, not days only, but the execution of the
sentence against his evil works; or defers his wrath and punishment; so
Jarchi,

"and the holy blessed God prolongs to him, and does not take vengeance
on him;''

and to this purpose is the Targum,

"and from the Lord is given to him space to return;''

yet surely I know; from the word and promise, and from experience,
having observed it in a multitude of instances, which have abundantly
confirmed the truth;

that it shall be well with them that fear God; not with a servile but
filial fear, with a holy, humble, fiducial, affectionate, and an
obediential fear; not through any terrible apprehension of his majesty,
his judgment, his wrath now and hereafter; but under a sense of his
being and perfections, and especially his mercy, grace, and goodness: it
is well with such persons in all things; with respect to things temporal
they shall not want what is proper for them; and with respect to things
spiritual they are interested in the love, grace, and mercy of God; have
much made known to them; are remembered by him; the sun of righteousness
rises upon them; the eye of God is on them, and his heart towards them,
and his hand communicates every needful supply to them; and they are
guarded, not only by his angels, but by himself; and it is well with
them at all times; in times of public calamity they are either taken
from it beforehand, or preserved in it; all afflictions are for their
good; it goes well with them at death and judgment; and they will be
happy both in the millennium state and in the ultimate glory, So the
Targum,

"it shall be well in the world to come with them that fear the Lord;''

see [Psa 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#007.md); with this compare [Isa
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#010.md); it is added,

which fear before him: whose fear is not hypocritical, but sincere and
hearty; not in show only, but in reality; not the precepts of men, and
as before them, but as the sight of God; having always a sense of
omniscience and omnipresence before them; and especially this fear is
exercised by them when they are his house, in the assembly of his
saints, attending his word and ordinances: or "which fear at his
presence"; which fills them with a holy awe, as wall as with joy and
gladness. The Targum is,

"which fear before him, and do his will.''

\(o\) "et prolongans ei", Montanus; "et prolongat in Deus dies",
Pagninus; so Mercerus, Junius & Tremellius, supply it; "et prorogat dei
Deus poenam", Piscator; "et differt Deus iram suam propter illium",
Vatablus.

[Ecclesiastes 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ecc 8:13</span></span>

But it shall not be well with the wicked,.... It shall be ill with him;
more is designed than is expressed, [Isa
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#011.md); in life they have no solid peace
and comfort; at death they will be turned into at judgment they will
hear the awful sentence, "Go, ye cursed", and will be in torment to all
eternity, [Mat 25:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#041.md);

neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow: wicked men
sometimes do not live out half their days, which, according to the
course of nature, and common term of life, they might be thought to
live; or if they prolong their days in wickedness, as sometimes they do,
[Ecc 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015.md); yet their days at longest
are but a shadow which declines, and is quickly gone; or, however, they
do not attain to eternal life, which is sometimes meant by prolonging
days, and is length of days for ever and ever, [Isa
53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010.md); this they never enjoy; but when
the righteous go into life lasting, they go into everlasting punishment.
The reason of this is,

because he feareth not before God; the fear of God is not before his
eyes, nor in his heart; he goes on in sin without fear of him, boldly
and openly commits it, and instead of taking shame for it, or repenting
of it, glories in it; stretches out his hand against God, and bids
defiance to him, and desires not the knowledge of him, and refuses to
obey him The Targum of the whole is,

"and it shall not be well with the wicked, and he shall have no space in
the world to come; and in this world his days shall be cut off, and they
shall flee and pass away as a shadow, because he fears not God.''

[Ecclesiastes 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ecc 8:14</span></span>

There is a vanity which is done upon the earth,.... Transacted in this
lower world under the sun, through the permission and direction of
divine Providence; not that it is a vanity on the part of God, who has
wise ends to answer by it, for the good of his people, the trial of
their graces, &c. or to bring sinners to repentance, or harden them in
sin; but this shows the vanity and uncertainty of all worldly things,
and that there is no happiness to be had in them;

that there be just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of
the wicked: to whom evil comes, as the Targum and Jarchi; who are
treated as if they were wicked men, and dealt with in providence as
sinners would be, if they had the just desert of their wicked works;
being attended with poverty, sickness, and disgrace, and other
calamities of life, as Job, Asaph, Lazarus, and others, and yet truly
righteous and good men;

again, there be wicked men to whom it happeneth according to the work of
the righteous; to whom good things come, as the Targum and Jarchi; who
have an affluence of good things, all the outward blessings of life, as
health, wealth, honour, long life, &c. as if they had lived the best of
lives, and were the most righteous persons upon earth; see [Job
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#007.md);

I said, that this also is vanity; this is said, as some think, according
to the judgment of corrupt nature; or as it is apprehended by such who
do not rightly consider the judgments of God and the wisdom of
Providence in the ordering of things to answer good purposes; or rather
the sense is, this is one of the miseries and infelicities of this life,
and which demonstrates the emptiness of all things here below, and that
the chief good and supreme happiness is not to be had here; but there is
and must be a future state, when all things will be set right, and
everyone will have and enjoy his proper portion.

[Ecclesiastes 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ecc 8:15</span></span>

Then I commended mirth,.... Innocent mirth, a cheerfulness of spirit in
whatsoever state condition men are; serenity and tranquillity of mind,
thankfulness for what they have, and a free and comfortable use of it;
this the wise man praised and recommended to good men, as being much
better than to fret at the prosperity of the wicked, and the seemingly
unequal distribution of things in this world, and because they had not
so much of them: as others; who yet had reason to be thankful for what
they had, and to lift up their heads and be cheerful, and rejoice in
hope of the glory of God in another world. The Targum interprets it of
the joy of the law;

because a man hath no better thing under the sun than to eat, and to
drink, and to be merry; of earthly things there is nothing better than
for a man freely and cheerfully, with moderation and thankfulness, to
enjoy what God has given him; this is what had been observed before,
[Ecc 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#024.md); and is not the language of
an epicure, or a carnal man, who observing that no difference is made
between the righteous and the wicked, that it is as well or better with
the wicked than the righteous, determines to give up himself to sensual
lusts and pleasures; but it is the good and wholesome advice of the wise
man, for men to be easy under every providence, satisfied with their
present condition and circumstances, and be cheerful and pleasant, and
not distress themselves about things they cannot alter;

for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life,

which God giveth him under the sun; man's present life is under the sun,
and is continued as long as it pleases God; though it is but short,
rather to be counted by days than years, and is a laborious one; and all
that he gets by his labour, enjoyed by him, is to eat and drink
cheerfully; and this he may expect to have and continue with him as long
as he lives, even food and raiment, and with this he should be content.

[Ecclesiastes 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ecc 8:16</span></span>

When I applied mine heart to know wisdom,.... The nature and causes of
things; the wisdom of God in his providence, and the grounds and reasons
of his various dispensations towards the children of men: the Targum
interprets it, the wisdom of the law;

and to see the business that is done upon the earth; either the business
of Providence, in dealing so unequally with the righteous and the
wicked, before observed; and which is a business very afflictive and
distressing for curious persons to look into, not being able to account
for it: or the labour and toil of men to get wealth and riches, and to
find happiness in them;

(for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his
eyes); or has any sleep in his eyes, through his eager pursuit after
worldly things, or, however, has but little; he rises early and sits up
late at his business, so close and diligent is he at it, so industrious
to obtain riches, imagining a happiness in them there is not: or else
this describes persons curious and inquisitive into the affairs of
Providence, and the reasons of them; who give themselves no rest, day
nor night, being so intent upon their studies of this kind; and perhaps
the wise man may design himself.

[Ecclesiastes 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ecc 8:17</span></span>

Then I beheld all the work of God,.... Not of creation, but of
Providence; took notice of it, contemplated on it, considered it, and
weighed it well; viewed the various steps and methods of it, to find
out, if possible, at least, some general rule by which it proceeded: but
all so various and uncertain,

that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: he can
find out that it is done, but not the reason why it is done: the ways of
God are in the deep, and not to be traced; they are unsearchable and
past finding out; there is a a depth of wisdom and knowledge, in them,
inscrutable by the wisest of men, [Psa
72:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#019.md);

because, though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it;
Noldius and others render it "although"; not only a man that, in a
slight and negligent manner, seeks after the knowledge of the works of
divine Providence, and the reasons of them; but even one that is
diligent and laborious at it is not able to find them out; they being
purposely concealed by the Lord, to answer some ends of his;

yea, further, though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be
able to find it; a man of a great natural capacity, such an one as
Solomon himself, though he proposes to himself, and determines within
himself to find it out, and sets himself to the work, and uses all the
means and methods he can devise, and imagines with himself he shall be
able to find out the reasons of the divine procedure, in his
dispensations towards the righteous and the wicked; and yet, after all,
he is not able to do it. The Targum is,

"what shall be done in the end of days;''

wherefore it is best for a man to be easy and quiet, and enjoy what he
has in the best manner he can, and submit to the will of God.
