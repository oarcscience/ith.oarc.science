INTRODUCTION TO PSALM 3

A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son. This is the first
of the psalms that has a title, and is called a Psalm; the word for
which, "mizmor", comes from one which signifies to "cut" or "prune" (r),
as trees are lopped of their superfluous branches; showing this to be a
composition of even feet, in proper metre, formed for the modulation of
the voice, to some tune or musical instrument; and it is said to be "a
psalm of David", which may be rendered "a psalm for" or "to David" (s),
as if it was wrote by another for his use, and inscribed to him; or
rather that it was given to him by the Holy Spirit, who was the author
of it, though he was the penman. It is observed by some, that wherever
the dative case is used in the title of the psalm, as it most frequently
is, as such a psalm to David, or to Asaph, it may signify that it came
from the Lord to him, or was divinely inspired; just as it is said, the
word of the Lord came to the prophets; though some render it "a psalm
concerning David" (t), his troubles, his faith and security in God, his
victory over his enemies, and salvation from the Lord. However, David
was the composer of this psalm, under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost,
occasioned by his flight from Absalom; who, having stolen away the
hearts of the people of Israel, entered into a conspiracy with them to
dethrone his father and place himself in his stead; and the people so
increased continually with him, that David thought it advisable to flee
from Jerusalem, [Sa2 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#012.md); and at the
time of his flight, or after it, he penned this psalm on account of it,
and as suitable to it. And now was fulfilled what God had said, by
Nathan the prophet, should befall him, because of the affair of
Bathsheba and Uriah; see [Sa2 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#011.md).
David was an eminent type of Christ, and so he was in his troubles, and
in these; as one of his sons conspired against him to dethrone him, and
take away his life; so Judas, one of Christ's disciples or children, for
disciples were called children, his familiar friend, that did eat of his
bread, lifted up his heel against him, and sought to betray him, and
did; and who, though he knew the designs of Judas against him, and did
not flee from him, but rather went to meet him, yet it is easy to
observe that he took the same route from Jerusalem as David did. At this
time he went over the brook Kidron, and to the mount of Olives; see [Joh
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#001.md); compared with [Sa2
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#023.md); And indeed the whole psalm may
be applied to Christ; and so as the second psalm sets forth the dignity
of Christ's person, as the Son of God, and the stability and enlargement
of his kingdom, notwithstanding the opposition made to him; this
expresses his troubles from his enemies, his death and resurrection from
the dead, his victory over his enemies, and the salvation he wrought out
for his people. In short, it may be understood of David as the type, of
Christ as the antitype, and of the people of God, being suited to their
experiences, more or less, in all ages; and in this large and extensive
way I shall choose to interpret it.

[Psalms 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 3:1</span></span>

Lord, how are they increased that trouble me?.... David's enemies
increased in the conspiracy against him, [Sa2
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#012.md); the hearts of the men of Israel
were after Absalom, and against him. Christ's enemies increased when
Judas with a multitude came to take him; when the body of the common
people cried out, Crucify him; when the assembly of the wicked enclosed
him, and pierced his hands and his feet. And the enemies of God's people
are many; the men of this world are against them; legions of devils
oppose them; and they have swarms of sins in their own hearts; and all
these give trouble. David's enemies troubled him; he wept as he went up
the hill, to think that his own son should seek to destroy him; that his
subjects, whom he had ruled so long with clemency, and had hazarded his
person in war for their defence, and to protect them in their civil and
religious rights, should rebel against him. Christ's enemies troubled
him, when they bound and led him away as a malefactor; when they spit
upon him, smote and buffeted him; when they scourged and crucified him,
and mocked at him. The enemies of the saints are troublers of them; in
the world, and from the men of it, they have tribulation; Satan's
temptations give them much uneasiness and distress; and their indwelling
sins cause them to cry out, "Oh wretched men that we are!" This address
is made to the Lord, as the Lord God omniscient, who knew the case to be
as it was, and who had a concern in it not being without his will, but
according to it, he having foretold it, and as he who only could help
out of it: and the psalmist delivers it in a complaining way, and in an
expostulatory manner; reasoning the case why it should be so, what
should be the reason of it, for what end and purpose it was; and as
wondering at it, suggesting his own innocence, and how undeserving he
was to be treated in such a way;

many are they that rise up against me; many in quantity, and great in
quality, great in the law, in wisdom, in riches, and in stature, as
Jarchi interprets it; such as Ahithophel and others, who rose up against
David in an hostile manner, to dispossess him of his kingdom, and to
destroy his life. And many were they that rose up against Christ; the
multitude came against him as a thief, with clubs and staves: the men of
this world rise up against the saints with their tongues, and sometimes
with open force and violence; Satan, like a roaring lion, seeks to
devour them, and their own fleshly lusts war against them.

[Psalms 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 3:2</span></span>

Many there be which say of my soul,.... Or "to my soul" (u), the
following cutting words, which touched to the quick, reached his very
heart, and like a sword pierced through it:

there is no help for him in God; or "no salvation" (w): neither in this
world, nor in that which is to come, as Kimchi explains it. David's
enemies looked upon his case to be desperate; that it was impossible he
should ever extricate himself from it; yea, that God himself either
could not or would not save him. And in like manner did the enemies of
Christ say, when they had put him upon the cross; see [Mat
27:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#043.md); and how frequent is it for the
men of the world to represent the saints as in a damnable state! and to
call them a damned set and generation of men, as if there was no
salvation for them? and how often does Satan suggest unto them, that
there is no hope for them, and they may as well indulge themselves in
all sinful lusts and pleasures? and how often do their own unbelieving
hearts say to them, that there is no salvation in Christ for them,
though there is for others; and that they have no interest in the favour
of God, and shall be eternally lost and perish? And this account is
concluded with the word

selah, which some take to be a musical note; and so the Septuagint
render it which Suidas (x) interprets the change of the song, of the
note or tune of it; and the rather it may be thought to be so, since it
is only used in this book of Psalms, and in the prayer of Habakkuk,
which was set to a tune, and directed to the chief singer. Kimchi
derives it from a root which signifies "to lift up", and supposes that
it denotes and directs to an elevation, or straining of the voice, at
the place where this word stands. Others understand it as a pause, a
full stop for a while; and as a note of attention, either to something
that is remarkably bad and distressing, as here; or remarkably good, and
matter of rejoicing, as in [Psa 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#004.md).
Others consider it as an affirmation of the truth of anything, good or
bad; and render it "verily", "truly", as, answering to "Amen"; so be it,
so it is, or shall be; it is the truth of the thing: to this sense
agrees Aben Ezra. But others render it "for ever", as the Chaldee
paraphrase; and it is a tradition of the Jews (y), that wherever it is
said, "netzach", "selah", and "ed", there is no ceasing, it is for ever
and ever; and so then, according to this rule, the sense of David's
enemies is, that there was no help for him in God for ever. A very
learned man (z) has wrote a dissertation upon this word; in which he
endeavours to prove, that it is a name of God, differently used, either
in the vocative, genitive, and dative cases; as, O Selah, O God, or of
God, or to God, &c. as the sense requires.

[Psalms 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 3:3</span></span>

But thou, O Lord, art a shield for me,.... Or "about me" (a) protecting
and defending me. David was a military man, and often alludes to
military affairs; and borrows words from thence, expressive of his great
security from the Lord; see [Psa 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002.md).
So Jehovah the Father was a shield to Christ, in his infancy, from
Herod's rage and fury; and afterwards from the insults of the Pharisees,
and their attempts to take away his life before the time; and in his
sufferings and death, so as that his faith and confidence in him were
kept up, and he got the victory over sin, Satan, and the world; see [Psa
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#009.md). And the Lord is a shield unto
all his people, [Gen 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#001.md). They are
kept by his power, and encompassed about with his favour, as with a
shield; his veracity and his faithfulness in his promises, and his
truth, are their shield and buckler: and especially his Son, the Lord
Jesus Christ, is the shield which faith makes use of, particularly his
blood and righteousness, and salvation by him; which it holds up, and
defends itself with, against the charges of the law, the accusations of
conscience, and the temptations of Satan; and which are a security from
the justice of God, and wrath to come;

my glory; who took David from the sheepfold, and made him king over
Israel, and raised him to all the glory he had enjoyed; and in whom he
gloried as his covenant God, and of whom he made his boast; and not of
his strength, valour, wisdom, riches, and honour. So God the Father is
the glory of Christ, the glorifier of him, by supporting him under his
sufferings, raising him from the dead, and setting him at his own right
hand, where he is crowned with glory and honour: he is the glory of his
people, in whom they glory, and by whom they are called to eternal
glory; and who will give it to them, and reveal it in them, even an
eternal weight of it, which the sufferings of this life are not worthy
to be compared unto;

and the lifter up mine head; such as the helmet is: the Lord was lifter
up of David's head when he brought him to the throne, and afterwards
gave him victory over his enemies; for so the phrase of lifting up the
head signifies; see [Kg2 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#027.md). And he
was the lifter up of Christ's head when he raised him from the dead; and
exalted him, both with and at his right hand, to be a Prince and a
Saviour, and gave him a name above every name. And he is the lifter up
of the heads of his people in conversion, when he raises them from a low
estate, and sets them among princes to inherit the throne of glory; and
when he gives them comfort, peace, and joy, which causes them to lift up
their heads; whereas in sorrow, and mourning, and distress, the head is
bowed down like a bulrush, [Isa 58:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#005.md);
and when he gives them boldness and confidence, as at the throne of
grace now, through the sprinkling of the blood of Christ upon them; so
at the bar of judgment hereafter, through the righteousness of Christ
put upon them, as that they shall not be ashamed nor confounded; see
[Luk 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#028.md); and he will be the lifter
up of their heads in the resurrection morn, and when they shall appear
with Christ in glory.

[Psalms 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 3:4</span></span>

I cried unto the Lord with my voice,.... The experience which the
psalmist had of being heard in prayer, was what gave great encouragement
to his faith, as to his interest in God and salvation by him, when his
enemies were so increased about him; for crying here is to be understood
of prayer, as it is often used in this book of Psalms: and so the Targum
renders it, "I prayed"; and this designs vocal prayer. Sometimes there
is a crying in prayer and no voice heard, as it is said of Moses, [Exo
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#015.md); and was the case of Hannah,
[Sa1 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#013.md); but this was with a voice,
and a loud one, as in [Psa 55:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#017.md);
denoting ardour, fervency, and importunity; and such prayer avails much
with God. The object addressed in prayer is the Lord, the God of his
life, and who was able to save him, and supply all his wants;

and he heard me out of his holy hill; either out of the church, the holy
hill of Zion, [Psa 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006.md); where David
prayed and God granted his presence, and gave an answer to his prayers;
or out from the mercy seat and ark, which was a type of the
propitiatory, Christ, and which David had brought to his own city, the
hill of Zion; or from heaven, the habitation of God's holiness: David
was a man of prayer, and he was often heard and answered by God. And
this also is true of Christ, he offered up prayers and supplications
with strong crying and tears to God [Heb
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007.md), that was able to save him; and he
was heard by him, yea, the Father always heard him: and God is a God
hearing and answering the prayers of his people, sooner or later:
sometimes before, sometimes at, and sometimes after their crying to him.

Selah; on this word; see Gill on [Psa
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#002.md).

[Psalms 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 3:5</span></span>

I laid me down and slept,.... After the battle was over between
Absalom's men and his, says Aben Ezra; but rather this was in the midst
of his trouble and distress, since he afterwards prays for salvation:
and this sleep was either, as Jarchi observes, through his heart being
overwhelmed with grief; for there have been instances of persons
sleeping through sorrow, as Elijah, Jonah, and the disciples of Christ,
[Kg1 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#004.md); or rather this is
expressive of the calmness and serenity of his mind amidst his troubles;
he laid himself down in peace, and slept quietly and comfortably; he did
not lose a night's rest, his sleep was sweet unto him; which was a
blessing of life from the Lord that everyone does not enjoy; see [Psa
127:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#002.md);

I awakened; in the morning, alive and cheerful, Some lay themselves down
and never awake more, as Sisera the captain of Jabin's army, and
Ishbosheth the son of Saul; and this might have been David's case,
considering the circumstances he was in: and others, through perplexing
thoughts and cares, or pains of body, or uneasy dreams, rise fatigued
and distressed; but David arose in good health of body, and tranquillity
of mind, and comfortably refreshed;

for the Lord sustained me; the psalmist committed himself to the care
and protection of God; he laid himself down in his arms, and there slept
in safety; the Lord preserved him, who is Israel's keeper, that neither
slumbers nor sleeps: and he rose in health and cheerfulness in the
morning, supported by his right hand. This shows, that lying down to
sleep, when in such circumstances, and awaking with cheerfulness, were
not owing to rashness, stupidity, and insensibility, but to divine
supports. These words may be interpreted, as they are by some of the
ancients, of the death of Christ, and of his resurrection from the dead
by the power of God; death is often expressed by sleep, and the
resurrection of the dead by an awaking out of sleep, [Dan
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002.md); and Christ's death being
signified by lying down and sleeping, may denote both the voluntariness
of it, that he laid down his life freely and willingly; and his short
continuance under the power of death, it was but like a night's sleep;
and his resurrection from the dead, being expressed by an awaking
through the Lord's sustaining him, shows that it was by the power of
God, even the exceeding greatness of his power: and the whole of this
may be applied to the case and state of the saints and people of God,
who at times have rest and peace amidst their enemies; though they have
tribulation in the world, they have peace in Christ; and notwithstanding
the temptations of Satan, and the corruptions of their own hearts, they
have joy and comfort through believing in Christ; the Lord sustains them
with precious promises, and supports them with the discoveries of his
love, and upholds them with the right hand of his righteousness.

[Psalms 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 3:6</span></span>

I will not be afraid of ten thousands of the people,.... David was a man
of courage from his youth; the instances of his attacking the lion and
the bear, when he kept his father's sheep, his engaging with Goliath,
and his military exploits, show it; and though there were now many
thousands up in arms against him, and his own son at the head of them;
all the tribes of Israel were revolting from him, and he was only
attended with a few of his friends, yet he was not dismayed; for that he
refers to this insurrection appears by what follows,

that have set themselves against me round about; and this was owing not
to himself; but to the Lord's sustaining of him; see [Psa
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001.md); and such courage and greatness
of soul did his antitype the Messiah express, and to a greater degree,
when Judas, with his band of soldiers, and the multitude with clubs and
staves, entered the garden to apprehend him; and when the prince of this
world was marching towards him, and when he was engaged with all the
powers of darkness, and when the sorrows of death compassed him about,
yet he failed not, nor was he discouraged: and something of this spirit
appears in true believers, When they are in the exercise of faith, have
the presence of God, and the discoveries of his love; they are then not
afraid what man can do unto them; nor are they afraid of devils
themselves, but wrestle against them; nor of any nor all their enemies,
they having victory over them, given by God through Christ.

[Psalms 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 3:7</span></span>

Arise, O Lord; save me, O my God,.... God sometimes, in the apprehension
of his people, seems to be as if he was asleep: when he does not appear
to them and for them, and does not exert his power on their behalf, then
they call to him to awake and arise; see [Psa
44:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#023.md); and it may be some respect is
had to the words of Moses when the ark set forward, [Num
10:35](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#035.md); and it may be observed, that
though David enjoyed so much peace and tranquillity of mind, and was in
such high spirits as not to be afraid of ten thousands of men, yet he
did not neglect the right means of deliverance and safety, prayer to
God, who he knew was his God; and he addresses him as such, and uses his
covenant interest in him, as an argument with him to arise and save him
from his enemies, who was able to do it, and to whom salvation belongs:
so Christ, his antitype, prayed to God as his God to save him, and was
heard by him in like manner; so the saints call upon God in a day of
trouble, cry to him in their distresses, to be delivered out of them;

for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheekbone; to smite
anyone upon the cheek is reckoned reproachful, and is casting contempt
upon them; see [Job 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#010.md) and the
sense is, that God had poured contempt upon his enemies in time past,
and had brought them to shame and confusion: hence he puts up the above
prayer as a prayer of faith for salvation, founded on past experience of
God's goodness; he prayed that his God would arise and save him, and he
believed he would because he had hitherto appeared for him, and against
his enemies;

thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly; who were like to beasts of
prey, whose strength lies in their teeth, whereby they do the mischief
they do; and the breaking of their teeth signifies the taking away from
them the power of hurting, and refers to the victories which God had
given David over the Philistines, Edomites, Syrians, and others; and
maybe applied to Christ, and be expressive of sin, Satan, the world, and
death, being overcome and abolished by him, and of the victory which the
saints have through him over the same enemies.

[Psalms 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 3:8</span></span>

Salvation belongeth unto the Lord,.... As the author of it; temporal
salvation is of him; all the deliverances of the saints out of their
troubles are from him; and to him is owing their spiritual and eternal
salvation; this belongs to Jehovah, Father, Son, and Spirit: Jehovah the
Father resolved upon it, chose men to it from everlasting, contrived the
scheme of it in his infinite wisdom, made a covenant with his Son, in
which he secured it, and appointed him to be the author of it, and sent
him in the fulness of time to effect it; and Christ the Son of God,
being qualified for it, being mighty to save, came into this world for
that purpose, and is become the author of eternal salvation; his own arm
has brought it to him, though there were many difficulties in the way;
such as fulfilling the law, satisfying justice, making an end of sin,
grappling with all the powers of darkness, and undergoing an accursed
death: and the Spirit of God, he makes men sensible of their need of
this salvation; he brings it near to them, and works faith in them to
lay hold upon it, and shows them their interest in it; and in
consequence of all this the glory of salvation belongs to the Lord,
Father, Son, and Spirit, and should be given to the Father as the
contriver of it, to the Son as the author of it, and to the Spirit as
the applier of it; see [Rev 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#010.md);

thy blessing is upon thy people; or it may be considered prayer wise,
let "thy blessing be upon thy people" (b); either upon those that were
on the side of David, or on those, as others interpret it, who had
imprudently joined themselves to Absalom; which latter sense, if right,
shows in what a divine frame and disposition of mind the psalmist was,
to pray for his enemies: or the words are an assertion, that the
blessing of the Lord was come upon his covenant people, and does descend
upon them as they are called by grace; even all spiritual blessings, the
blessings of a justifying righteousness, of pardon of sin, of
reconciliation and peace by the blood of Christ, of adoption, and of
eternal life; the blessing of grace, and the blessing of glory.

Selah; on this word; see Gill on [Psa
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#002.md).
