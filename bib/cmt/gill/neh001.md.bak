### [Nehemiah Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001.md)

INTRODUCTION TO NEHEMIAH 1

This chapter relates how that Nehemiah, being at Shushan in Persia, and
meeting with some Jews, inquired of the state of Jerusalem, of which
having a melancholy account, he betook to mourning, fasting, and prayer,
[Neh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001.md), and his prayer is recorded,
[Neh 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#005.md).

[Nehemiah 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 1:1</span></span>

The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah,.... Or his transactions and
deeds; for "dibre" signifies things done, as well as words spoken; who
Hachaliah his father was is not known; the Arabic version adds, the high
priest, without any foundation; though some have thought that Nehemiah
was a priest, from a passage in"Therefore whereas we are now purposed to
keep the purification of the temple upon the five and twentieth day of
the month Chisleu, we thought it necessary to certify you thereof, that
ye also might keep it, as the feast of the tabernacles, and of the fire,
which was given us when Neemias offered sacrifice, after that he had
builded the temple and the altar.'' (2 Maccabees 1:18)and from signing
and sealing the covenant at the head of priests, [Neh
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#001.md), but he rather seems to be of the
tribe of Judah, see [Neh 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#003.md), and
Nehemiah may be the same that went up with Zerubbabel, and returned
again, and then became the king's cupbearer; though some are of another
opinion; see Gill on [Ezr 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#002.md),

and it came to pass in the month Chisleu; the ninth month, as the Arabic
version; of which see [Ezr 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#009.md),

in the twentieth year; not of Nehemiah's age, for, if he went up with
Zerubbabel, he must be many years older; but in the twentieth year of
the reign of Artaxerxes, [Neh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001.md),

as I was in Shushan the palace; a city in Persia, the royal seat of the
kings of it; as Ecbatana was in the summer time, this in the spring, as
Cyrus made it, according to Xenophon (b); but others say (c) it was
their seat in winter, and this was the season now when Nehemiah was with
the king there; for Chisleu was a winter month, answering to part of
November and of December; of Shushan; see Gill on [Dan
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#002.md), to which may be added what a
traveller of the last century says (d) of it,"we rested at Valdac, once
the great city Susa, but now very ruinous; it was first built by
Tythonus, and his son Memnon, but enlarged by Darius the son of
Hystaspes; in the building whereof Memnon was so exceeding prodigal,
that, as Cassiodorus writeth, he joined the stones together with
gold--such was the beauty and delectableness of it for situation, that
they called it "Susa", which in the Persian tongue signified a "lily",
but now it is called Valdac, because of the poverty of the place;''and
it is generally supposed to have its name from the abundance of lilies
about it; but Dr. Hyde (e) gives another signification of its name, he
says the Persians called it, "Sus", which signifies "liquorice", but for
what reasons he says not. There is a city now called Shustera, and is
thought by some travellers to be built at least very near where Shushan
formerly stood (f).

[Nehemiah 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">neh 1:2</span></span>

That Hanani, one of my brethren,.... Either in natural relation, [Neh
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#002.md), or being a Jew of the same nation
and religion; so Jarchi interprets it, one of my companions or
acquaintance:

he and certain men of Judah; who came from thence to Shushan on some
account or another:

and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left
of the captivity; who were returned from it to their own land; he
inquired of their health and prosperity, in what circumstances they
were, whether prosperous or adverse, whether they flourished, or were in
distress:

and concerning Jerusalem; whether it was rebuilt, the houses and walls
of it, and in what condition it was.

[Nehemiah 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">neh 1:3</span></span>

And they said unto me, the remnant that are left of the captivity there
in the province,.... In Judea, now reduced to a province of the Persian
empire:

are in great affliction and reproach; harassed and distressed,
calumniated and vilified, by their enemies the Samaritans:

the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are
burnt with fire; that is, its wall and gates were in the same condition
in which Nebuchadnezzar had left them, for since his times as yet they
had never been set up; for this is not to be understood of what was
lately done by their adversaries, which is not at all probable.

[Nehemiah 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">neh 1:4</span></span>

And it came to pass, when I heard these words,.... This sad and
melancholy account of things:

that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days; sat down upon the
ground in dust and ashes, after the manner of mourners, and wept
bitterly, and mourned in a most sorrowful manner, see [Job
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#008.md),

and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven; that made it, and dwells
in it.

[Nehemiah 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">neh 1:5</span></span>

And said, I beseech thee, O Lord God of heaven,.... He prayed not to the
host of heaven, the sun in it, as the Persians, but to the God of it, in
an humble supplicant manner:

the great and terrible God; who is to be feared, and had in reverence of
all his creatures, because of his greatness and glory, being God over
all, blessed for ever, and his name holy and reverend:

that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him, and observe his
commandments; who keep them from a principle of love to him; to those he
has made gracious promises in his covenant, which he truly and
faithfully performs; and the consideration of these perfections in God
animates and encourages good men in prayer to him.

[Nehemiah 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">neh 1:6</span></span>

Let thine ear be now attentive,.... To his prayer, as in [Neh
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#011.md),

and thine eyes open; to behold with pity and compassion the distressed
case of Jerusalem, and the Jews in it:

I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy
servants; this he had continued to do ever since he heard of their
trouble and calamity:

and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned
against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned; he considered
sin as the cause of all this evil that had befallen his people, and
confesses it with sorrow and humiliation, and not their sins only, but
his own personal and family sins.

[Nehemiah 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">neh 1:7</span></span>

We have dealt very corruptly against thee,.... Corrupted his covenant,
laws, and precepts, as well as themselves, ways, and works; all which
were against the Lord, contrary to his nature, mind, and will:

and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments,
which thou commandedst thy servant Moses; the laws, moral, ceremonial,
and judicial.

[Nehemiah 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">neh 1:8</span></span>

Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant
Moses,.... To publish and declare to the children of Israel, [Deu
28:64](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#064.md),

saying, if ye transgress; the law of God:

I will scatter you abroad among the nations; as now they had been among
the Assyrians, Chaldeans, Medes, and Persians.

[Nehemiah 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">neh 1:9</span></span>

But if ye return unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them,....
Return by repentance, and, as a proof of the genuineness of it, yield
obedience to the commands of God, and continue therein:

though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven;
that is, the uttermost parts of the earth, the most distant regions; so
called, because at the extreme parts of the horizon, according to our
apprehension, the heavens and earth touch each other; so that what is
the uttermost part of the one is supposed to be of the other:

yet will I gather them from thence and will bring them unto the place
that I have chosen to set my name there; that is to Jerusalem where the
temple was built, and his name was called upon.

[Nehemiah 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">neh 1:10</span></span>

Now these are thy servants, and thy people,.... Meaning those that were
in Jerusalem and Judah, gathered out of several countries, and returned
to Jerusalem:

whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand;
touching and moving the heart of Cyrus to proclaim liberty to them.

[Nehemiah 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">neh 1:11</span></span>

O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of
thy servant,.... To the prayer of Nehemiah, put up at this time:

and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name; the
prayer of the Jews in Judea, whose desire was to worship the Lord in his
temple, according to his will:

and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day; meaning himself, who was
to wait on the king of Persia that day, and, if he had opportunity,
intended to lay the case of the Jews before him, and therefore entreats
he might meet with success:

and grant him mercy in the sight of this man; King Artaxerxes, who was
but a man, and whose heart was in the hands of God, and he could easily
move him to pity and compassion towards his poor people the Jews:

for I was the king's cupbearer; in the execution of which office he was
often in the king's presence, and hoped to have an opportunity of
speaking to him in the behalf of the Jews; this with the Persians was
reckoned a very honourable office (g). A son of Prexaspes, a very
honourable man, was made cupbearer to Cambyses; and so it was with the
Greeks and Romans (h); and the poets not only make Ganymedes to be
Jupiter's cupbearer (i), but even Vulcan himself is put into this office
(k).
