INTRODUCTION TO SECOND SAMUEL 18

In this chapter is an account of David's review of his army, preparing
it for battle with Absalom, and those with him, [Sa2
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#001.md); and of the defeat and flight of
the rebels, [Sa2 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#006.md); and of the
death of Absalom, and the manner of it, and of his burial, [Sa2
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#009.md); and of the news of it brought to
David by different persons, [Sa2
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#019.md); and of his great grief and
sorrow on that account, [Sa2 18:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#033.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 18:1</span></span>

And David numbered the people that were with him,.... Which Josephus
says (d) were four thousand; but one would think there should be more by
what follows:

and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them; he
divided his army into companies, which consisted some of a thousand and
others of a hundred; over each of which he set captains, to lead them
on, direct, and command them in battle.

\(d\) Antiqu. l. 7. c. 10. sect. 1.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 18:2</span></span>

And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of
Joab,.... Very likely that which made the centre of the army, since Joab
was the general of the army; though this distribution was made when
David thought to have headed the army himself, and so made with respect
to that:

and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's
brother; who was next to Joab in the army, and fought with him against
the Syrians and Ammonites, [Sa2 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#010.md),

and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite; of whom see [Sa2
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#019.md); of these two parts consisted
the right and left wings of the army:

and the king said unto the people; the soldiers, and particularly the
officers:

I will surely go forth with you myself also; in which he seemed very
resolute and peremptory; and this he proposed to do, not merely to
animate the soldiers with his presence, and to show that he was willing
to hazard his life with them, but chiefly for the sake of Absalom, to
preserve his life, if possible.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 18:3</span></span>

But the people answered, thou shalt not go forth,.... They were as
resolute as David:

for if we flee away, they will not care for us; to pursue after us:

neither if half of us die, will they care for us; they will make no
account of the victory; but if they could slay David, or get him into
their hands, it would be more to them than if the whole army was routed:

but now thou art worth ten thousand of us; not only in our own esteem,
but in the account of the enemy, who had rather thou shouldest fall into
their hands than ten thousand of us; and as the advantage to them, so
the loss to us would be more than ten thousand men:

therefore now it is better that thou succour us out of the city; either
by sending them provisions or recruits, that might be there in reserve,
if necessary; or by being ready to receive them into it should they be
repulsed; or rather by his prayers to God for them; so the Targum,"now
it is better that thou pray for us out of the city;''that is, that the
Lord would help us; and so most of the Jewish commentators understand it
of helping them by his prayers and counsels.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa2 18:4</span></span>

And the king said unto them, what seemeth you best I will do,.... Which
was an instance of great condescension in him; and it was his wisdom and
prudence to yield to them at such a time as this, and especially as
their sentiments were founded on affection and loyalty to him:

and the king stood by the gate side; of the city of Mahanaim:

and all the people came out by hundreds, and by thousands; and passed by
him, to whom no doubt he gave his blessing and best wishes; and, as
Abarbinel thinks, now it was he composed and said the twentieth psalm,
"The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble", &c. [Psa
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#001.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa2 18:5</span></span>

And the king commanded Joab, and Abishai, and Ittai,.... His three
generals, to whom he had committed his army divided into three parts:

saying, deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom;
he does not call him his son, being in rebellion against him, but the
young man, who was young, and rash, and foolish, and so to be pitied;
his request is, that they would spare him, and not take away his life,
when in their power; that they would not aim at him, and push him hard,
and fall upon him with wrath and fury; but if he fell into their hands,
to take him alive, and bring him away, and not put him to death. This
flowed from a natural affection to him, and a concern for the welfare of
his soul, that he might not die in this sin; and also from a
consciousness that it was for his own sins that he was raised up to
rebel against him; and he seems to speak as if he was certain that the
battle would go for him, and against Absalom; and which he might
conclude from the answer of prayer he had in defeating the counsel of
Ahithophel:

and all the people heard when he gave all the captains charge concerning
Absalom; not only the three generals, but all the captains of hundreds
and thousands, and this was heard by the common soldiers as well as by
the people of the city that were spectators on this occasion, see [Sa2
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#012.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 18:6</span></span>

So the people went out into the field against Israel,.... Josephus (e)
calls it a great field, with a wood behind it:

and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim; or near it (f) rather; not in
a wood in the tribe of Ephraim, which lay on this side Jordan; whereas
this battle was fought on the other side Jordan, in the land of Gilead,
not far from Mahanaim, where was this wood; and which was so called,
either from the slaughter of the Ephraimites here in the times of
Jephthah, [Jdg 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#004.md); or from the
Ephraimites feeding their cattle here and near it; for the Jews say (g),
that Joshua gave them a grant to feed their cattle in any wood in any of
the tribes of Israel; and lying near Jordan, they used to drive their
cattle over to this place, from whence it had its name.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa2 18:7</span></span>

Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David,....
That is, the people of Israel that were under Absalom, these were beaten
by David's army:

and there was a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men;
including both those that fell in the field of battle, and that were
slain in the pursuit; and this is to be understood only of Absalom's
party.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 18:8</span></span>

For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country,....
Or the warriors were scattered, as the Targum; Absalom's soldiers, their
ranks were broken, and they were thrown into the utmost confusion, and
ran about here and there all over the field or plain in which the battle
was fought, and into the neighbouring wood:

and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured;
there were more slain in it the in the field of battle, what by one
thing or another; as by falling into pits and on stumps of trees, and
being entangled in the bushes, and could make but little haste, and so
were overtaken by David's men, and slain; insomuch that, as Josephus (h)
observes, there were more slain fleeing than fighting, and perhaps some
might perish by wild beasts; so the Targum,"and the beasts of the wood
slew more of the people than were slain by the sword;''and so the Syriac
and Arabic versions render the words to the same purpose.

\(h\) Ut supra. (Antiqu. l. 7. c. 10. sect. 2.)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 18:9</span></span>

And Absalom met the servants of David,.... When his army was routed, he
was in such a fright that he knew not which way to flee, and instead of
flying from David's men, he fled in the way of them; but none of them
attempted to slay him, nor even to stop him, but let him pass by them,
knowing David's charge concerning him:

and Absalom rode upon a mule; as was common for great personages to do
in those days, [Sa2 13:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#029.md),

and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak; and running
full speed, Absalom could not guide him, nor stop, nor divert him from
going under it:

and his head caught hold of the oak; either the hair of his head was
twisted and entangled in the thick boughs of the oak; or rather his head
was jammed into a forked branch of the oak:

and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; hung in the air
between both, as unworthy to live in either:

and the mule that was under him went away; and left him hanging in the
oak.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa2 18:10</span></span>

And a certain man saw it,.... Saw him in the above posture, one of
David's soldiers:

and told Joab, and said, behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak; caught
by the neck in one, out of which he could not disengage himself, but
there he hung, though alive.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 18:11</span></span>

And Joab said unto the man that told him,.... That gave the above
account of him:

and, behold, thou sawest him; in reality; or, "didst thou see him?" is
it a fact?

and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground; kill him on the
spot, that he might have dropped from the tree to the ground:

and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver; on the news of it,
for doing it, which was near twenty four shillings of our money;
Josephus says (i) fifty shekels; the Arabic version has it ten thousand
talents of silver, too great a sum by far:

and a girdle? which was a mark of great honour, and a token of a
commission under him, and of investing: him with a military office; see
[Sa1 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#004.md); it used to be given as an
honorary reward to soldiers that behaved well, as on the contrary it was
reckoned a reproach to be ungirt, or the girdle to be taken away (k).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 18:12</span></span>

And the man said unto Joab,.... Disdaining his proposal:

though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand; or
such a sum should be offered to me; the Arabic version is a million:

yet would I not put forth my hand against the king's son; to smite him,
and slay him:

for in our hearing the king charged thee, and Abishai, and Ittai; his
three generals:

saying, beware that none touch the young man Absalom; so as to slay him;
they were charged to abstain from it themselves, and to watch and
observe others, and keep them from doing it.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 18:13</span></span>

Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life,.... Or
"soul"; he should not only have exposed his life to danger, but acted
falsely to the king, by going contrary to his orders; yea, would have
done that which was contrary to his own conscience; and if he had buoyed
himself up with the hope of impunity, or of a reward, he should have
found himself mistaken; the textual reading is, "against his life" (l),
or "soul", the life of Absalom, by taking it away:

for there is no matter hid from the king; this, though done ever so
secretly, would have come to his knowledge by some means or another, and
then I should have incurred his displeasure, and suffered for it:

and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me; to accuse and
bring him to justice; he would have been so far from protecting him,
that he would have been the first man that would have insisted on it
that he should be punished for it; or why dost not thou thyself set
thyself against him, and smite him? thou mayest if thou pleasest, yonder
he hangs, go and smite him.

\(l\) , Sept. "contra animam illius", Piscator.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 18:14</span></span>

Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee,.... It is not worth
while to talk with thee any longer, nor must I lose time, and neglect my
opportunity; I do not desire you to go and smite him, I will go and do
it myself:

and he took three darts in his hand; or three rods, which were either
all iron, or however the tops of them were iron spikes:

and thrust them through the heart of Absalom; or through the midst of
his body; for if he had thrust through his heart, properly speaking, he
must have died instantly, whereas he seems to have lived after this:

while he was yet alive; Joab found him alive when he came to him, and so
he was when he thrust his darts through him; and so he was afterward;
for the words may be rendered, "being yet alive", even after the darts
were fixed in him, and even so deeply as to pierce through his body:

in the midst, or "heart":

of the oak; into which the darts penetrated.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa2 18:15</span></span>

And ten young men that bare Joab's armour,.... That waited upon him in
the battle, to carry his armour, and supply him with it as he should
have occasion; these, by his orders:

compassed about, and smote Absalom, and slew him; they enclosed him that
none might rescue him, and smote him with their spears or swords, or
whatsoever armour they had, until it was a clear case that he was really
dead. Joab in this disobeyed the king's order, but provided for the good
of the nation, and the safety of the king. The Jews observe (m), that
measure for measure was given to Absalom; he was proud of his hair, [Sa2
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#025.md), and therefore was hanged by it,
[Sa2 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#009.md); he lay with ten concubines
of his father, [Sa2 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#021.md), and
therefore was smitten with ten lances or spears by ten young men; and he
stole three hearts, the heart of his father, the heart of the sanhedrim,
and the heart of the men of Israel, and therefore three darts were fixed
in him, [Sa2 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#014.md).

\(m\) Misn. Sotah, c. 1. sect. 8.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 18:16</span></span>

And Joab blew the trumpet,.... As the sign of a retreat:

and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; upon the sound of
the trumpet, the meaning of which they understood:

for Joab held back the people: from shedding any more blood; the head of
the conspiracy being removed, the thing would be crushed at once; and
Joab neither chose to slay any more, nor take any prisoners, to be tried
as traitors, being unawares, without thought, drawn into this rebellion.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 18:17</span></span>

And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood,.... In
the wood of Ephraim, near to which the battle was fought, and into which
Absalom fled, and where he was slain:

and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: his punishment was very
exemplary; he was first hanged on an oak, and then thrust through with
darts, and swords, and then covered with stones, [Sa2
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#009.md), pointing to the death that a
rebellious son, according to the law, ought to die, [Deu
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#021.md); though this might be done in
honour of him as a king's son; for such "tumuli", or heaps of stones or
earth, were used by the ancients as sepulchral monuments, and the larger
the more honourable (n); See Gill on [Jos
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#026.md) and See Gill on [Jos
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#029.md),

and all Israel fled everyone to his tent; or to his city, as the Targum;
everyone returned to their own house, and to their own business, and so
the rebellion ceased.

\(n\) Homer. Iliad. 23. ver. 245, 257.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 18:18</span></span>

Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken,.... Had taken it into his head,
had of himself devised it, as Kimchi explains it; he contrived the
following scheme to perpetuate his memory:

and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: or
valley, the valley of Jehoshaphat; this pillar was of marble, as
Josephus (o) says, and stood about two furlongs or a quater mile from
Jerusalem. The author of Cippi Hebraici (p) places it at the bottom of
the mount of Olives: this is observed to show how vain are the devices
and contrivances of men's hearts; Absalom intended to have been buried
under or by this monumental pillar near Jerusalem, and, lo, he was
buried in a pit, under an heap of stones, in a wood on the other side
Jordan; whether his bones were ever removed hither it is not certain,
though a notion has obtained that his grave was near this pillar.
Rauwolff (q) says, that as you go from the valley of Jehoshaphat (r) to
the Mount of Olives, you see below, towards your left hand, near unto
the bridge of the river Kidron, an old square building like unto a
steeple; this, although it is believed to this day, not only by
Christians, but also by Turks and Moors, to be the grave of Absalom, as
you shall see them fling stones into it as they go by, to revenge his
unfaithfulness to his father, yet was he not buried there. Sandys (s)
says, at the east end of the bridge (over Kidron), and a little on the
north, stands the pillar of Absalom, being yet entire, and of a good
fabric, rising in a lofty square, below adorned with half columns,
wrought out of the sides and corners, of the Doric form; and then
changing into a round, a good height higher doth grow to a point in
fashion of a bell, all framed of the growing stone; against this there
lies a great heap of stones, which increaseth daily, by Jews and
Mahometans throwing stones as they pass by; so that the frontispiece of
it, which faces the road, as Le Bruyn (t) says, looks like a mountain of
stones; but as to the fabric itself, he says, there is not a finer piece
of workmanship to be met with in all those parts; it takes up a compass
of ground of eighty two feet and an half square; the body, which is
square, with its moulding, is one entire piece; and the coping, which is
an ornament to it, and runs up into a point, taken with the rest of the
work, is above thirty feet high; twenty columns, cut out of the same
rock, add to the beauty of this pile; one sees through a broken window a
great many pieces of antiquity that hang up in a chamber. Adrichomius
also relates (u), from travellers, that in the king's valley is now a
tower, and a large heap of stones, which is increased every day more and
more; for Heathens and strangers passing by there have a custom to cast
everyone a stone at it, as it were revenging, according to the law,
Absalom's rebellion against David his father, and curse him after this
manner; let Absalom the parricide be cursed, and whoever unrighteously
persecutes their parents are cursed for ever:

for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance; for though he
had three sons, it seems they were all dead, see [Sa2
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#027.md),

and he called the pillar after his own name, and it is called unto this
day Absalom's place; or his "hand" (w), the work of his hand; some
wrongly think it was in the form of an hand; it was an obelisk, or
monument, erected to preserve his name; but since it became so infamous,
it would have been better to have had it buried in oblivion. Such
sepulchral monuments were used in other nations; so Minerva advised
Telemachus (x) to go in quest of his father Ulysses, and if he could not
find him, but was assured of his death, then to raise a signal or
monument in memory of him, which he resolved to do.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa2 18:19</span></span>

Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok,.... To Joab; for it seems he stayed
with the army when he with Jonathan brought the message from Hushai to
David:

let me now run, and bear the king tidings how that the Lord hath avenged
him on his enemies; which he thought would be very acceptable to hear of
as soon as possible; and to be a messenger with tidings of a victory, as
it was honourable, so likewise profitable then as now; though perhaps
Ahimaaz might have no respect to the reward, as indeed none could be
expected, since the death of Absalom would be so disagreeable to the
king; but was desirous of it, that the king might be acquainted with the
event of the battle as soon as might be.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa2 18:20</span></span>

And Joab said unto him, thou shall not bear tidings this day,....
Because Joab knew the tidings of Absalom's death would not be acceptable
to the king; and Ahimaaz being a good man, and the son of a priest, for
whom Joab had a respect, he would not send the tidings by him, which he
was sensible would not recommend him to the king:

but thou shalt bear tidings another day; when any salvation is wrought,
or victory obtained, the tidings of which will be welcome:

but this day thou shall bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead;
and thou must carry the news concerning his death, which it is not
proper thou shouldest, being a priest, nor will it be to thine
advantage.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa2 18:21</span></span>

Then said Joab to Cushi,.... The Ethiopian, or blackamoor; who either
was an Ethiopian by birth and proselyted, or he was an Israelite of a
black complexion, and therefore so called; and was judged a proper
person by the general to carry such dismal news to the king, as he knew
it would be. Some Jewish writers (a) take him to be the same with Cush
the Benjaminite, in the title of the seventh psalm, [Psa
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#001.md); and that he is the same that told
Joab he saw Absalom hanging in an oak, and declared that, if a thousand
shekels of silver were offered him, he would not have put forth his hand
against him, [Sa2 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#010.md); though some
think this was one of the ten young men that waited on Joab, and by his
orders slew Absalom; but it would have been dangerous for one of these
to have carried the tidings, had he been known by David to have done it:

go tell the king what thou hast seen: by which it should seem that he
was present when Absalom was killed:

and Cushi bowed himself unto Joab; in reverence to him as his general,
and in thankfulness for sending him on this errand:

and ran; as fast as he could.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa2 18:22</span></span>

Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab,.... He could not
be easy, even though a messenger was dispatched, but pressed Joab still:

but howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi; only permit me
to go after him, though not as a messenger:

and Joab said, wherefore wilt thou run, my son? having a great affection
for him, and concerned that he should take trouble on him to no purpose:

seeing thou hast no tidings ready; no news to carry, but what Cushi is
gone with, and so can have no audience of the king, nor any reward from
him.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa2 18:23</span></span>

But howsoever (said he) let me run,.... Be it as it may, I beg I may
have leave; and being so very importunate, it was granted:

and he said unto him, run; since he would take no denial:

then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi; who ran by
the way of the mountains; which though the shorter way, that through the
plain was easiest, and soonest run, though the longest.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa2 18:24</span></span>

And David sat between the two gates,.... Of the city of Mahanaim; which
being a fortified place had two walls, one within another, and in each
wall a gate; and between these David sat, waiting for news of the
battle:

and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall; the
gate to the outward wall, over which was a tower, and on that a flat
roof; to which the watchman went to observe if he could see an express
coming; no doubt by David's orders:

and lifted up his eyes and looked; that is, very diligently and
wistfully:

and, behold, a man running alone: which made him the more observable,
and was the more likely to be a messenger.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa2 18:25</span></span>

And the watchman cried and told the king,.... Called with a loud voice
from the roof of the watchtower to the king, sitting between the gates,
and informed him what he saw:

and the king said, if he be alone there is tidings in his mouth; for if
the army was routed and fled, and were pursued, there would be more in
company, or several running one after another; but being but one, it was
highly improbable that he was sent express:

and he came apace, and drew near; which was another sign of his being a
messenger, the haste he made towards the city.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa2 18:26</span></span>

And the watchman saw another man running,.... At a further distance:

and the watchman called unto the porter; that kept the gate, under which
the watchtower was:

and said, behold, another man runneth alone; as the other, and has the
same appearance of a messenger:

and the king said, he also bringeth tidings; it being usual then, as
now, to dispatch one messenger after another, as fresh accounts coming
in made it necessary.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa2 18:27</span></span>

And the watchman said, me thinketh,.... Or, "I see" (b); I perceive, so
it appears to me:

that the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son
of Zadok; who it seems was well known, and famous for his manner of
running and swiftness in it, having been employed in carrying expresses
before from Jerusalem to David, and his army, wheresoever they were; and
some of these persons thus employed were very swift; we read (c) of one
that was a king's messenger, that went from Jerusalem to Tyre, on the
first of Elul, or August, in a night and a day; which, according to
Bunting (d) was an hundred miles: this watchman must be one of David's
sentinels, who was well acquainted with the people about him:

and the king said, he is a good man, and cometh with good tidings; he
knew he was a man of courage, and therefore was not one that fled, but
must be a messenger; and that he was well affected to him, and would
never be the messenger of evil tidings to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">sa2 18:28</span></span>

And Ahimaaz called and said unto the king,.... As soon as he came so
near as to be heard by him, before he came up to him, he said with a
loud voice:

all is well; the king's army has had success, beat the rebels, and
obtained a complete victory: or "peace" (e); for it is but one word in
the original, which signifies all happiness and prosperity, and this he
wished the king; and so it is the same as if he had said, God save the
king, may all happiness attend him:

and he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king; when he
came nearer to him, not only in reverence of him, but in thankfulness to
God:

and said, blessed be the Lord thy God, which hath delivered up the men
that lifted up their hand against my lord the king; in which he ascribes
the victory, not to Joab and his army, but to the Lord, to whom he gives
thanks; and this agreeably to his character as a good man, and a priest
of the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">sa2 18:29</span></span>

And the king said, is the young man Absalom safe?.... Or, is there
"peace" (f) to him? you say there is peace, and that prosperity and
success have attended my army; but what peace has Absalom? is he well,
and in safety? David seemed more concerned for him than for his army and
the success of it; and even suggests as if it was nothing if Absalom was
not safe, so great were his affections towards him:

and Ahimaaz answered, when Joab sent the king's servant; which was
Cushi, the first messenger, whose office perhaps it was to be one of the
king's messengers, and therefore called his servant:

and me thy servant: Ahimaaz himself who was sent after the other:

I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was; he perceived that the
tidings of the death of Absalom would be disagreeable to the king, and
therefore concealed it from him; and though a good man, he cannot be
excused from lying, for certainly he knew that Absalom was dead, as
appears from [Sa2 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#019.md); though indeed
what he said might be true, that after Joab had sent him and Cushi, as
the Targum paraphrases it, he saw a company of people gathered together
in a tumultuous manner, the meaning of which he knew not; but then this
was no other than an evasion.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">sa2 18:30</span></span>

And the king said unto him, turn aside, and stand here,.... On the side
of him, not far from him, until the other messenger came, that he might
learn from them both the true state of the case:

and he turned aside, and stood still; saying nothing more to the king,
nor he to him.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">sa2 18:31</span></span>

And, behold, Cushi came,.... A little after:

and Cushi said, tidings, my lord the king; news is sent and brought by
me, and good news it is:

for the Lord hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against
thee; they are either killed or dispersed; there is an entire victory
over them, and deliverance from them.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">sa2 18:32</span></span>

And the king said unto Cushi, is the young man Absalom safe?.... The
same question that was put to Ahimaaz, [Sa2
18:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#029.md); which shows what lay nearest
his heart, and was uppermost in his mind:

and Cushi answered, the enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise
against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is, which was tacitly
saying he was dead, and so David understood it; and he expressed it in
such a manner, that David could not be displeased with the messenger;
though the message was grievous to him.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">sa2 18:33</span></span>

And the king was much moved,.... His affections were moved, his passions
were stirred up; he was greatly troubled, distressed, and grieved:

and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept; got out of sight and
company as soon as he could; as his own dwelling was at some distance,
he made haste to the chamber in the watchtower, over the gate of the
city, where the watchman was, to vent his grief; and could not suppress
it till he got thither:

and as he went; up the stairs to the chamber:

thus he said, O my son Absalom! my son, my son Absalom! which repetition
expresses the vehemence of his affections, and how inconsolable he was
on account of his son's death:

would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son! some think he
said this on account of his eternal state, being satisfied of his own;
but it may be it was only the effect of natural affection, indulged to
too great a degree, and unbecoming so good a man in such a case; the
Targum is,"I wish I had died for thee, and thou hadst remained this
day.''
