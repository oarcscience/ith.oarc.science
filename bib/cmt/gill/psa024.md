INTRODUCTION TO PSALM 24

A Psalm of David. This psalm is thought by some of the Jewish writers
(d) to have been wrote when the ark was brought from the house of
Obededom to the city of David, and put into the place prepared for it by
him, [Sa2 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#017.md); to which reference is
supposed to be had in [Psa 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#007.md); or
after that David had built an altar in the threshing floor of Araunah
the Jebusite, and had knowledge of the hill Moriah, as the place where
the sanctuary was to be built; called the hill of the Lord, and his holy
place, [Psa 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#003.md); however, it was
certainly written by David, under the inspiration of the spirit of God;
and is a prophecy of Christ, and of the Gospel church, and describes the
members of it.

\(d\) Aben Ezra & Kimchi.

[Psalms 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 24:1</span></span>

The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof,.... The whole
universe, all the terraqueous globe, both land and water, and the
circumambient air, and all that is therein; the fishes of the sea, the
fowls of the air, the beasts of the field, all plants and vegetables
that spring out of the earth, and metals and minerals in the bowels of
it; all which are the riches of the Lord the earth is full of, [Psa
104:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#024.md); see [Psa
50:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#010.md);

the world, and they that dwell therein; the habitable world, and the
dwellers on it, rational and irrational. These words may be interpreted
of Christ, who is Lord of all; he made the world, and has a right and
claim to all things in it; for the same person is here spoken of as in
the preceding psalm, under the character of a shepherd; and this shows
him to be very fit and proper for such an office, seeing he cannot fail
of feeding and protecting his sheep; nor can they want any good thing,
since the fulness both of nature and of grace is with him; and hence it
is that all things are theirs, whether the world, or things present, or
things to come; and though they seem to have nothing, yet possess all
things, they possessing him whose all things are. The apostle makes use
of this passage of Scripture, to prove, explain, and direct in the use
of Christian liberty, with respect to the free use of creatures, they
all being the Lord's; and therefore good, and to be received with
thanksgiving: and yet, inasmuch as there is a variety of them, such
should be abstained from, when to use them serves to embolden evil men
in their wicked ways, or offend and grieve weak Christians, [Co1
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#025.md).

[Psalms 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 24:2</span></span>

For he hath founded it upon the seas,.... Or "with" them, as some
interpret (e) the particle he hath founded the earth and seas together,
and both upon nothing; and yet are stable and firm; or "by the seas"
(f), near unto them, at the side of them; which, though higher than the
earth, are wonderfully bounded by the power of God, so as not to return
and cover the earth; see [Job 38:8](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#008.md); so
the particle is used in [Psa 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003.md). Some
have thought that the first earth, which Peter says was standing in the
water, and out of the water, [Pe2 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#005.md),
was made in the form of an egg, and that the waters were under the
earth, and the earth was as a crust or shell over them, until the deluge
came; and this crust then broke in, and formed the sea; and so it was
literally true, that the earth was founded upon, or over the waters;

and established it upon the floods; the floods of the seas, or rivers of
water running to and fro in it: this shows the ground and foundation of
Christ's right and claim to the earth, and all that is in it; which is
not by reason of his father's gift to him as Mediator, but by virtue of
his concern in creation, the world, and all things in it, being made and
established by him; in him do all things consist, [Col
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016.md).

[Psalms 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 24:3</span></span>

Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord?.... Though the Lord has a
claim in general to the whole world, and all its fulness; yet there is a
particular part of it, or spot in it, which is his special and peculiar
property, and that is his church and people; for though some reference
may be had, in this passage, to Mount Moriah, and the hill of Zion, on
which the temple was afterwards built, and is called the hill of the
Lord, where he desired to dwell, [Psa
68:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#015.md); yet the church is mystically
intended, and is so called on account of its visibility, through a
profession of faith in Christ, and for its immovableness, being built on
him;

and who shall stand in his holy place? the same with the hill of the
Lord; the temple being to be built upon it, where the Lord took up his
residence, and was worshipped, and holiness becomes the house of God for
evermore: the import of these questions is, who is a proper person to be
an inhabitant of Zion, or a member of a Gospel church? and the answer to
them is in [Psa 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#004.md), in which is a
description much like that which is given of one hundred forty and four
thousand seen with the Lamb on Mount Zion, [Rev
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#001.md); compare with this verse.

[Psalms 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 24:4</span></span>

He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart,.... Though "clean hands" are
mentioned first, as being more obvious to view, and better known, and
more subject to the cognizance and observation of others; yet a "pure
heart" is first in being and in order; from whence cleanness of hands,
when right and truth springs: no man has a pure heart naturally and of
himself: the heart is desperately wicked; the imagination of the
thoughts of it is evil continually; the mind and conscience are defiled
with sin; nor can any man make his heart clean, or say he is pure from
sin; but it is God that creates a clean heart, and renews a right spirit
within men, and purifies the heart by faith, which is led to the blood
of sprinkling, which purges the conscience, and cleanseth it from all
sin; and from this purity of heart flows purity of life and
conversation, signified by "clean hands"; the hand being the instrument
of action, holy actions, or good works, performed from a principle of
grace, are meant; the phrase is expressive of a holy, harmless, and
innocent conversation, washing the hands being used to denote innocence,
[Mat 27:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#024.md); not a conversation
entirely free from sin, nor by which a man is justified before God; for
though he wash his hands ever so clean, they will not be pure in his
sight, and will need washing in the blood of the Lamb; but it denotes a
conversation upright in general, and declares a man righteous in the
sight of men, and distinguishes him from one of a dissolute life, whose
hands are full of blood, and defiled with sin;

who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity; or "set his heart upon"
(g), and desired vain things, as the phrase is sometimes used, [Deu
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#015.md); that is, the vain things of
this world; as the riches, honours, pleasures, and profits of it; or has
not served other gods, the idols of the Gentiles, which are lying
vanities, but has lifted up his soul to God, and served him only: or
"who hath not received his soul in vain" (h); from the hands of God, but
loves him with all his soul, believes with the heart in Christ for
righteousness, being sanctified by the Spirit of God; and so the desire
of his soul is to his name, and the remembrance of him. The "Keri", or
marginal reading, according to the points, is, "who hath not lifted up
my soul to vanity" (i); that is, has not taken the name of God in vain,
or swore falsely by his name; his soul being put for his name or
himself; and by which he is said sometimes to swear, [Jer
51:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#014.md); and this sense the Jewish
interpreters (k) generally give into. The Targum seems to take in both
the writing of the text and the marginal reading, as it often does, and
renders the words, "who hath not sworn in vain, to the condemnation of
his soul"; though sometimes to his own disadvantage, yet not to the hurt
of others; see [Psa 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#004.md); it follows,

nor sworn deceitfully; by bearing false witness against any man; or by
cheating him out of his substance through a false oath.

[Psalms 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 24:5</span></span>

He shall receive the blessing from the Lord,.... Or "who receives" (l);
the future for the present; and so is a continuation of the description
of a person proper to enter and abide in the church of God, as [Psa
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#006.md) seems to require; even one who
has received every spiritual blessing in Christ in general, special
grace out of his fulness; particularly the blessing of pardon, as also
adoption, and a right to eternal life; though it may be that the
following clause is explanative of this;

and righteousness from the God of his salvation; from Christ, who is God
his Saviour, the author of salvation; and who has brought in an
everlasting righteousness, which is in him, and is a gift of his grace,
and is received from him by faith, and is a great blessing indeed; it
secures from condemnation and death, and entitles to eternal life.

[Psalms 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 24:6</span></span>

This is the generation of them that seek him,.... The persons above
described are such, who in every age are the generation of the children
of God, and are accounted by him for a generation; they are such that
seek him, in the first place, with their whole hearts, and in Christ,
where they find him;

that seek thy face, O Jacob. By the "face" of God is meant the favour of
God, the discoveries of his love, the light of his countenance, than
which nothing is more desirable to gracious souls, or more sought after
by them; and by Jacob is meant the God of Jacob; and so Apollinarius has
it in his metaphrase; see [Psa 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#001.md);
unless Christ should be intended, one of whose names is Israel, [Isa
49:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#003.md); or the words may be supplied, as
they are by some Jewish writers (m), "this is Jacob"; or the persons
before described are the seed of Jacob, and who are called by his name:
and it may be observed, that the church of God often bears the same
name, [Isa 43:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001.md); and then the sense
is, the persons whose characters are given above are fit to ascend, and
stand in the holy hill of God, are Israelites indeed, in whom there is
no guile.

3:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#002.md).

[Psalms 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 24:7</span></span>

Lift up your heads, O ye gates,.... By which the gates of hell are not
meant; nor are the words to be understood of the descent of Christ
thither, to fetch the souls of Old Testament saints from thence; who the
Papists dream were detained in an apartment there, as in a prison,
called by them "limbus patrum"; seeing these, immediately upon their
separation from the body, were in a state of happiness and glory, as the
parable of the rich man and Lazarus shows; and since Christ, at his
death, went, in his human soul, immediately into heaven, or paradise,
where the penitent thief was that day with him: nor do the words design
the gates of heaven, and Christ's ascension thither, shut by the sins of
men, and opened by the blood of Christ, by which he entered himself, and
has made way for all his people; though this sense is much preferable to
the former. The Jewish interpreters understand the phrase of the gates
of the temple, which David prophetically speaks of as to be opened, when
it should be built and dedicated by Solomon, and when the ark, the
symbol of Jehovah's presence, was brought into it, and the glory of the
Lord filled the house; so the Targum interprets this first clause of
"the gates of the house of the sanctuary"; though the next of "the gates
of the garden of Eden"; but the words are better interpreted, in a
mystical and spiritual sense, of the church of God, the temple of the
living God, which is said to have gates, [Isa
60:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#011.md); and is itself called a door,
[Sol 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#009.md); where the open door of the
Gospel is set, or an opportunity of preaching the Gospel given, and a
door of utterance to the ministers of the word, and the doors of men's
hearts are opened to attend to it; and indeed the hearts of particular
believers, individual members of the church, may be intended, or at
least included in the sense of the passage; see [Rev
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#020.md); and it may be observed, that the
new Jerusalem is said to have gates of pearl, through which Christ, when
he makes his glorious appearance, will enter in his own glory, and in
his father's, and in the glory of the holy angels;

and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors; or "the doors of the world"
(n); which some understand of the kingdoms and nations of the world, and
of the kings and princes thereof, as called upon to open and make way
for, and receive the Gospel of Christ into them, and to support and
retain it; but it is best to interpret it of the church and its members,
whose continuance, perpetuity, and duration, are here intimated, by
being called "everlasting doors"; which may be said to be "lifted up",
as it may respect churches, when those things are removed which hinder
communion with Christ; as their sins, which separate between them and
their God, and the wall of unbelief, behind which Christ stands; and
sleepiness, drowsiness, coldness, lukewarmness, and indifference; see
[Isa 59:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#002.md); and when public worship is
closely and strictly attended on, as the ministration of the word and
ordinances, prayer to God, which is the lifting up the heart with the
hands to God, and singing his praise: and as it may respect particular
believers; these doors and gates may be said to be lifted up, when their
hearts are enlarged with the love of God; the desires and affections of
their souls are drawn out towards the Lord, and the graces of the Spirit
are in a lively exercise on him; and when they lift up their heads with
joy in a view of Christ coming to them. This must not be understood as
if they could do all this of themselves, any more than gates and doors
can be thought to open and lift up themselves;

and the King of glory shall come in; the Lord Jesus Christ, called the
Lord of glory, [Co1 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#008.md); who is
glorious in himself, in the perfections of his divine nature, as the Son
of God; being the brightness of his Father's glory, and the express
image of his person; and in his office as Mediator, being full of grace
and truth, and having a glory given him before the world was; and which
became manifest upon his resurrection, ascension to heaven, and session
at God's right hand; and particularly he is glorious as a King, being
made higher than the kings of the earth, and crowned with glory and
honour; and so the Targum renders it , "the glorious King"; and he is
moreover the author and giver, the sum and substance, of the glory and
happiness of the saints: and now, as the inhabitants of Zion, and
members of the church, are described in the preceding verses, an account
is given of the King of Zion in this and the following; who may be said
to "come into" his churches, when he grants his gracious presence, shows
himself through the lattices, and in the galleries of ordinances, in his
beauty and glory; takes his walks there, and his goings are seen, even
in the sanctuary; and where he dwells as King in his palace, and as a
Son in his own house; and he may be said to come into the hearts of
particular believers, when he manifests himself, his love and grace,
unto them, and grants them such communion as is expressed by supping
with them, and by dwelling in their hearts by faith,

[Psalms 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 24:8</span></span>

Who is this King of glory?.... Which question is put by the church, or
particular believers; not through ignorance, as the daughters of
Jerusalem, [Sol 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#009.md); or the Pharisees,
when Christ made his public entrance into Jerusalem, [Mat
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#010.md); much less in pride and
haughtiness, in scorn and derision, as Pharaoh, [Exo
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#001.md); and the Capernaites, [Joh
6:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#042.md); but as wondering at the glories
and excellencies of his person, and as desirous of knowing more of him.
The answer to the question is,

the Lord strong and mighty: he whose name alone is Jehovah; the most
high in all the earth; the everlasting I AM; Jehovah our righteousness;
the mighty God, even the Almighty; the Son of Man, whom God has made
strong for himself: his strength and might have been seen in the
creation of all things out of nothing, in upholding all things by his
power, in the redemption of his people, in the resurrection of himself,
in dispossessing the strong man armed out of the hearts of his chosen
ones, in the government of his church, and the care of all his saints,
and in keeping them from a final and total falling away. From the first
of these words, which is only here used, Mars, because of his strength,
has the name of Azizus; which name of his Julian (o) makes mention of;
and very probably Hesus, also a deity of the ancient Gauls, spoken of by
the poet (p), and by Lactantius (q); but to none does it belong as to
our Jehovah;

the Lord mighty in battle; as he was when he was up on the cross; when
he made an end of sin, spoiled principalities and powers; abolished
death, and destroyed him that had the power of it; and as he will be at
the last day, when the kings of the earth shall make war with him, and
he shall overcome them; when the beast and false prophet shall be taken,
and cast alive into the lake of fire; and the remnant shall be slain
with the sword of his mouth; see [Rev
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#014.md); and who is now the Captain of
salvation to his people, their Leader and Commander; who furnishes them
with weapons of warfare, which are mighty through God; who teaches their
hands to war, and their fingers to fight the good fight of faith; and
makes them more than conquerors, through himself, that has loved them.

[Psalms 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 24:9</span></span>

Lift up your heads, O ye gates even lift them up, ye everlasting doors;
and the King of glory shall come in. See Gill on [Psa
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#007.md). This is repeated on account of
the backwardness and negligence of churches, and particular believers,
to open and let Christ in; as may be seen in the case of the church in
[Sol 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#002.md); as well as the more to set
forth the greatness and glory of Christ, about to make his entrance, and
to command a proper awe and reverence of him: some think respect is had
to the twofold coming of Christ; first into the second temple, and next
at the last judgment; though rather the certainty of his coming, in a
spiritual manner, to his church and people, is here designed.

[Psalms 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 24:10</span></span>

Who is this King of glory?.... This is repeated, because of the
preceding words, and in order to have a further account of his glorious
Person, as follows:

the Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory; he who is the Lord of
sabaoth, the Lord of the armies, both of the heavens and the earth; at
whose dispose and control all things are in both worlds, above and
below: this is the great and glorious Person that condescends to dwell
in his churches, and in the hearts of his people; and this honour have
his saints.

Selah; on this word; see Gill on [Psa
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#002.md).
