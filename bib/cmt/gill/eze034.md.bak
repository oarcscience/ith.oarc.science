INTRODUCTION TO EZEKIEL 34

In the former chapter the prophet prophesies against the people of the
Jews, both those of the captivity, and those who were not; and here
against the shepherds of Israel. This he is bid to do, [Eze
34:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#001.md), whose cruelty to the flock,
negligence and unfaithfulness are exposed, [Eze
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#003.md), for which reasons they are
threatened to be deprived of their office, [Eze
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#007.md), and the Lord promises to take
the care of the flock upon himself, to seek out his sheep, and feed
them, and do every kind office to them, [Eze
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#011.md) and then the strong of the
flock, that oppressed the weak, are threatened with punishment, [Eze
34:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#017.md) and the promise of the Messiah,
as the shepherd of the flock, is made, under whom all prosperity and
happiness might be expected, [Eze
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023.md).

[Ezekiel 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 34:1</span></span>

The word of the Lord came unto me,.... The date of this prophecy is not
given; however, it seems to have been delivered after the destruction of
Jerusalem; the causes of which are mentioned, the sins of the people and
their governors, which the prophet is directed to expose:

saying: as follows:

[Ezekiel 34:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 34:2</span></span>

Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel,.... Or,
"concerning" (p) them; the governors of them, as the Targum and Jarchi;
their political governors, their kings, princes, and civil magistrates
of every order and degree; so Kimchi interprets it of kings; and it was
common with the eastern nations, and with the Greeks, to call kings
shepherds; and one and the same word; in the Greek language, signifies
to feed sheep, and to govern people; see [Psa
78:72](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#072.md), also their ecclesiastical
governors are intended, prophets, priests, Levites, scribes, and
Pharisees; these were bad shepherds, or they would not have been
prophesied against; and though they were shepherds of Israel, this must
be done:

prophesy, and say unto them, thus saith the Lord God unto the shepherds:
that the message to them might be the more regarded, it is ordered to be
delivered in the name of the Lord; otherwise they would have been apt to
have despised it, and charged the prophet with impertinence and
rudeness:

woe be to the shepherds of Israel, that do feed themselves! that is,
themselves only, and not the flock: had they fed the flock, as well as
themselves, they would not have been blamed; but they took no care of
the people over whom they were set only minded their own affairs, to get
riches and honour, but neglected the good of the people, yea, cruelly
oppressed them:

should not the shepherds feed the flocks? undoubtedly they should; it is
their duty, the business of their office, so to do; kings to rule over
their subjects, defend their persons and property, and secure their
privileges and liberties to them; and ecclesiastical rulers, ministers
of the word, should feed the flock or church of God committed to them
with knowledge and understanding; see [Jer
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#015.md).

\(p\) "de pastoribus", V. L. Grotius; "super pastores", Pagninus,
Montanus.

[Ezekiel 34:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 34:3</span></span>

Ye eat the fat,.... The Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, and Arabic versions,
render it, "the milk"; the words for fat and milk differ only in the
points; and this was not unlawful, for

who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock? [Co1
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#007.md), provided it was done with
moderation, that they ate some, but not all; but these rulers milked
their subjects too much, oppressed them with heavy taxes, and got their
substance into their own hands. The Targum is,

"ye eat the good;''

they got possessed of the best of their substance; as did also their
ecclesiastical rulers, who were greedy shepherds, that could never have
enough; they looked for their gain from their quarter, and even devoured
widows' houses, [Isa 56:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#011.md),

ye clothe you with the wool: the pure wool, as the Targum, the finest of
it; they fleeced the flock, and stripped the people of their riches; and
minded nothing but their own backs and bellies:

ye kill them that are fed; or, that "are fat" (q); the richest of the
people they brought accusations and charges against for capital crimes;
and so put them to death under a colour of justice, that they, might get
their estates into their hands:

but ye feed not the flock; did not govern the people well, by doing
justice and judgment among men, as became civil magistrates; did not
deliver out words of faith and sound doctrine, to feed the souls of men
with, which is the duty of those that preside in the church of God.

\(q\) "quod pingue est", Vatablus, Bochartus; "pinguem", Cocceius,
Starckius. So Ben Melech.

[Ezekiel 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 34:4</span></span>

The diseased have ye not strengthened,.... Such, in the civil polity,
who were poor, and in necessitous circumstances, were not relieved; such
who were injured and oppressed by others were not vindicated; and such
as were forced to flee to other countries, or were carried captive, no
care was taken, or methods used, to ransom them, and, bring them back;
all which may be meant by this and the following metaphors, taken from
the evil things that befall a flock of sheep: and such who were weak
through spiritual diseases, their prophets and teachers took no care to
cure them of their diseases, and to strengthen these feeble minded ones
with divine cordials and spiritual food, and confirm them in the faith:

neither have ye healed that which was sick; by directing them to the
great Physician of souls, and to his precious blood for healing and
pardon of sin:

neither have ye bound up that which was broken; whose consciences were
wounded, and hearts broken, with a sense of sin; or who had fallen to
the breaking of their bones, and should be restored in a spirit of
meekness and dealt gently with, as surgeons do in setting and binding up
broken bones:

neither have ye brought again that which was driven away; or, "was gone
astray" (r); being seduced by false teachers; and yet, though it was
known they were, no care nor pains were taken to reclaim and restore
them:

neither have ye sought that which was lost; that wandered of their own
accord, and perished for want of knowledge, and were lost for lack of a
guide to direct them, and no one would do this good office to them:

but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them; in an arbitrary and
tyrannical way, lording it over God, s heritage, [Pe1
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#003.md).

\(r\) "vagam aut errantem", Bochartus, and some in Vatablus.

[Ezekiel 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 34:5</span></span>

And they were scattered because there is no shepherd,.... No good one;
there were shepherds, but they were idol shepherds, good for nothing,
and it was all one as if there were none: so, in Christ's time, there
were the Scribes and Pharisees; yet, since these did not feed the people
with wholesome doctrine, they are said to be as sheep without a
shepherd, and scattered abroad, as here from the fold, and from one
another; dispersed here and there, seeking food, and none, which moved
his compassion, [Mat 9:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#036.md), in the
political sense it may refer to their captivity, and their dispersion
among the nations, having no king: So the Targum,

"and they were scattered without a governor.''

And they became meat to all beasts of the field when they were
scattered; the Targum is,

"and they were delivered to all the kingdoms of the people to be
consumed;''

such as the Assyrians, Babylonians, Ammonites, Moabites, and others; and
may be applied to false teachers, those grievous wolves, which spare not
the flock, into whose hands members of churches, professors of religion,
fall, when neglected by their shepherds.

[Ezekiel 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 34:6</span></span>

My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high
hill,.... As sheep do, when gone astray, go from mountain to hill; so
the people of Israel fled from place to place, through the cruelty of
their rulers, or through the force of the enemy, being carried captive
into many kingdoms and nations, signified by mountains; and perhaps
there is some allusion, to their worshipping of idols on hills and
mountains, being drawn into it by the false prophets:

yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth; so great and
general was the dispersion by the several captivities: the Lord has
sheep, or some of his elect, some that belong to his flock, in all parts
of the world:

and none did search or seek after them; but he will himself, as in [Eze
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#011.md), for he will lose none of them;
but this does not excuse the shepherds.

[Ezekiel 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 34:7</span></span>

Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the Lord. Or, "ye governors",
as the Targum, both civil and ecclesiastical; ye kings, princes, and
magistrates; ye prophets and teachers of the people, who ought to have
attended to the word of grace, to the doctrines of the Scriptures, and
fed the people with them; but, since you have not, hear the word of
threatening from the Lord, and the just punishment that shall be
inflicted on you.

[Ezekiel 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 34:8</span></span>

As I live, saith the Lord,.... It is an oath, and which he swore in his
wrath, being provoked with the shepherds for their misadministration:

surely, because my flock became a prey, and my flock became meat to
every beast of the field, because there was no shepherd; a prey to all
the kingdoms of the people, being without a governor, as the Targum; or
to false teachers, there being no spiritual pastors to take care of
them:

neither did my shepherds search for my flock; that was scattered, and
carried captive, and became a prey to others; even those that were of
God's appointing, as the kings of Israel, their priests and prophets;
for both their civil polity and ecclesiastical hierarchy were of God,
though the ends thereof were not answered, or the persons put into
office did not do their duty:

but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flock: See Gill on [Eze
34:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#002.md), [Eze
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#003.md).

[Ezekiel 34:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 34:9</span></span>

Therefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the Lord. This is repeated,
that it might be observed, and for the confirmation of it; it might be
depended upon that what follows would be accomplished, unless they
changed their conduct and behaviour; and, to leave them inexcusable,
they are again called upon to hear what the Lord should say unto them.
The Targum is,

"therefore, O ye wicked governors, return to the law, and I will have
mercy on you; hearken to the doctrine of the law, and receive the word
of the Lord.''

[Ezekiel 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 34:10</span></span>

Thus saith the Lord God, behold, I am against the shepherds,.... His
heart was against them; his hand was against them; his face was against
them, to cut them off. The Targum is,

"behold, I will send my fury upon the governors;''

and there was good reason for it, they were against him and his glory,
against his flock, his people, his cause, and interest; sad it is for
any to have God against them, and to be against God; for none ever
hardened themselves against him and prospered, [Job
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#004.md),

and I will require my flock at their hand; the full tale of them that
have been committed to their care, and will punish them for the neglect
of them; their blood, their life, and the loss of them, I will require
at their hands; thus he punished Zedekiah and his princes, and the
priests and prophets:

and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; take the kingdom from
them, as he did from Zedekiah; abolish the ecclesiastical hierarchy
among the Jews; cut off three shepherds in one month, the priests,
prophets, and scribes of the people; and put the flock into other hands,
the apostles and ministers of the Gospel:

neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; enrich themselves
with the substance of the people:

for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat
for them; who, instead of being shepherds to feed the flock, were no
other than wolves in sheep's clothing, and ravenous lions and bears,
which devoured the flock; but this they should do no longer.

[Ezekiel 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 34:11</span></span>

For thus saith the Lord God,.... Since the shepherds are so negligent,
careless, and cruel:

behold, I, even I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out; as he
did the Jews, in all countries where they were, so his elect in all
places where they are: he is the omniscient God, and knows them that are
his, and can call his own sheep by name; he knows the places where they
are; for he has fixed the bounds of their habitation, and was delighting
himself in the habitable parts of the earth, where he knew they would
be, even before the world was; he knows the time of finding them, which
he himself has fixed, and which is a time of love, and a time of life;
and he can distinguish them, notwithstanding the filth they have
contracted by their sins and transgressions, and from the crowd they are
among: and he is the omnipotent God, that can take them out of what
hands soever they may be, or in whatsoever state and condition they are;
though in the hands of Satan, in the paws of that devouring lion, and in
a pit wherein is no water, in a horrible pit, the mire and clay: he that
says this is the owner and proprietor of them; and that is the reason
why he searches and seeks them out; and which he repeats for the
confirmation of it, and to show the vehemence of his affection towards
them, and how bent he is upon it, and how eager and resolute in his
pursuit after them: he searches for his chosen people among the ruins of
Adam's fall, in whom they fell as others; among the men of the world,
where they are; among the dust of the earth, where his lost piece of
silver and those pearls lie; among the mountains of sin or
self-righteousness, where these sheep are wandering; and he never leaves
off seeking and searching till he has found them: and what moves him to
it is not their nature, for they are no better than others; nor their
numbers, for they are few; but his love to them, the relation he stands
in to them as their shepherd, his interest and property in them, his
covenant on their account, and also his own glory.

[Ezekiel 34:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 34:12</span></span>

As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his
sheep that are scattered,.... That is, when they have been scattered,
and are got together again; then he goes among them, to see if there are
any missing, and in wheat condition they are, and what they want:

so will I seek out my sheep, and deliver them out of all places where
they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day; such as, in a
literal sense, the time of the captivity was, when the Jews were
dispersed in the various provinces of Babylon, and other countries; and
which was a time of darkness and affliction to them. The time of Adam's
fall was a dark and cloudy day; when all sinned in him, and were made
sinners by his disobedience; when the sentence of condemnation and death
passed upon all, and they became liable to utter ruin and destruction;
when darkness and ignorance seized all human nature; when all mankind
were separated from God, and set at a distance from him; in consequence
of which the children of God, his sheep, were scattered abroad. A time
of unregeneracy is a cloudy and dark day with God's elect; they are in
darkness, and walk in darkness, and are darkness itself, till made light
in the Lord: and so is a time of desertion; when the Lord's people are
laid in darkness, and the deeps, and both sit and walk therein, and see
no light; when they can neither see the Lord, nor hear from him, nor
have any communion with him; when the sun of righteousness is withdrawn
or eclipsed; and they cannot see their interest clear in spiritual and
eternal things: as is also a time of persecution with the churches of
Christ; when both ministers and people are scattered abroad, and their
eyes cannot behold their teachers; and moon and stars are not seen for
many days, Gospel ministers and Gospel ordinances: and the same is a
time of blasphemy and error; and when it is neither day nor night, as is
the present season; but there is no day so cloudy and dark but the
shepherd can see his sheep, and will look them out, though they cannot
see him.

[Ezekiel 34:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 34:13</span></span>

And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the
countries, and will bring them to their own land,.... Which was in part
fulfilled when the Jews were delivered from the Babylonish captivity;
and which may well be ascribed to the Lord, since it was he that stirred
up Cyrus, king of Persia, to proclaim their liberty; and which raised
the spirit of the people to go up upon it, and build the temple in
Jerusalem, [Ezr 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001.md), though it will
have a more full accomplishment in the latter day, when these people
shall be gathered out of all countries where they are dispersed, and
return to their own land, and embrace the true Messiah, and be all
saved; of which there was a pledge and presage in the apostles' time, on
the day of Pentecost; when some out of all nations were collected
together at Jerusalem, and heard the wonderful things of God in their
own language, and were converted; and afterwards, wherever the Gospel
came in the Gentile world, it was first preached to the Jews, and was
the power of God to salvation first to them; by which means the sheep of
Christ, the elect of God among them, in each of the parts of the world,
were gathered in: but this need not be confined to the Jews only; since
the Lord had other sheep beside them, even among the Gentiles, in all
parts of the world; whom he searches for, and effectually calls by his
grace, and separates them from the rest of the world, and brings them
into his churches, and among his people:

and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers: not upon the
barren mountains of Sinai and Horeb, or with the works of the law; for
there is no righteousness, life, and salvation by them, and so no peace
and comfort, or food for faith; but upon the mountains of Israel, the
churches of Christ, comparable to mountains for their height,
visibility, immovableness, and for their pasturage: here the great
Shepherd, the Lamb Christ Jesus, is, even on Mount Zion; here his under
shepherds are, who feed the flock with knowledge and understanding; here
the word of God is preached, the wholesome words of our Lord Jesus, by
which souls are nourished up to everlasting life; in these mountains the
feast of fat things is made; here the green pastures are, the sheep are
made to lie down in; and here the lilies grow, among whom Christ feeds;
and by these mountains run the "rivers" of everlasting love and covenant
grace, the streams of Gospel doctrines, and the waters of Gospel
ordinances, to the great refreshment of the saints; here the Lord feeds
his people:

and in all the inhabited places of the country; in the private dwellings
of the saints, as well as in public assemblies.

[Ezekiel 34:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 34:14</span></span>

I will feed them in a good pasture,.... Or with good food, as the
Targum: such as the fulness of grace in Christ, where believers go in
and out, and find pasture; and where they may feed to the full, have
bread enough, and to spare; and may draw water with joy out of the full
wells of salvation: this is good food; food indeed, in opposition to
that which was typical, or is imaginary; this is spiritual food,
suitable to the spirits of men, brought by the Spirit of God, and
relished by a spiritual man; this is savoury food, soul satisfying and
soul strengthening food; this is nourishing food, and what will endure
to everlasting life: and such is the Gospel, the promises and doctrines
of it, in which there is a variety of food; milk for babes, and meat for
strong men; sweet to the taste, and health to the bones; salutary and
nourishing, and which makes glad the heart; and of the same kind are the
ordinances of the Gospel, the breasts of consolation, the goodness and
fatness of the Lord's house; which he makes his people partakers of, and
satisfies them with.

And upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be; there shall
they lie in a good fold; of the same nature and use are the churches of
Christ as a fold is to the sheep; as that they are separated, divided,
and distinguished from others; as into a fold, the sheep of Christ are
gathered into churches; where they lie together, are united and knit
together in love, and where they have communion with one another, and
keep each other warm, and stir up one another to love and good works;
whereby the vitals of religion are preserved; here they are kept in the
night season, and fed in the winter; these like a fold are a sort of
fence unto them, and a preservation of them from wolves and bears; and
here they lie down, and have spiritual rest, ease, and safety: and as in
a fold there are lambs, and sheep, and goats, so in churches there are
different sorts folded together, weaker and stronger Christians; and
some only nominal ones, who will be separated at the last day. A fold
may be taken down, and removed from place to place, and so may visible
congregated churches; the candlestick may be removed out of its place,
the word and ordinances; and so a Gospel church state may be carried
from place to place; and there is but one fold for Jews and Gentiles,
and this is a good one; see [Joh
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#016.md).

And in a fat pasture shall they feed on the mountains of Israel; on the
feast of fat things there, and so become fat and flourishing; See Gill
on [Eze 34:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#013.md).

[Ezekiel 34:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 34:15</span></span>

I will feed my flock,.... This is repeated for the further confirmation
of it, that it might be depended upon that the Lord would feed his
people in the manner before promised; and it gives a reason why he would
do it, because they were his flock; he had a right unto them, a property
in them; they were separated and distinguished from others by him, as
the church of God is; and which is also purchased by Christ, and
gathered out of the world by his Spirit and grace; and therefore he will
feed them, or take care that they shall be fed, [Act
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028.md),

and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord; in the good fold
provided for them; where they have both rest and safety, and also plenty
of suitable food; See Gill on [Eze
34:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#014.md). The Targum is,

"I will govern my people, and will cause them to dwell safely, saith the
Lord God;''

The Septuagint and Arabic versions add, "and they shall know that I am
the Lord".

[Ezekiel 34:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 34:16</span></span>

And I will seek that which was lost,.... As all men are in Adam, and
through his fall, and by their own actual transgressions; and so the
elect of God among the rest; who are lost not with respect to God's
knowledge of them, love to them, and care for them; but with respect to
their knowledge of him, affection for him, and regard to his will,
service, and glory; they are lost to themselves, they know not where
they are, what is their state and condition, and how to get out of it;
they cannot help themselves, nor can any other creature help them; and
they see themselves to be in this lost and undone condition, when they
are enlightened by the Spirit of God: but they are not irretrievably
lost, for they are preserved in Christ Jesus; and he has been sent to
seek and to save them; which he has done by redeeming them from sin,
Satan, and the law; and, in the effectual calling, he goes after them,
he sends his Gospel to them, and his Spirit unto them, and returns them
to himself, the Shepherd and Bishop of souls; and whereas after this
they go astray like lost sheep, he seeks and looks them up, and restores
their souls, [Psa 119:176](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#176.md),

and bring again that which was driven away; through the power and
prevalence of unbelief, from holding fast to the head Christ, departing
at least partially from the living God; from dealing by faith with his
precious person, blood, and righteousness; and from the precious
promises, as not belonging to them, and refusing to be comforted by
them; but the Lord brings back such again, and causes them to believe:
Thomas is a notorious instance of this, [Joh
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#024.md), such also who are driven away
through the force of Satan's temptations from the throne of grace; from
the word and ordinances; and from private conversation with the saints,
being hypocrites, as he suggests unto them; these the Lord brings back,
by rebuking the tempter, and delivering out of his temptations: likewise
such as are driven out of the right way of truth, and carried away with
the error of the wicked, through the influence of bad pastors or false
teachers, [Jer 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#001.md), these will he
restore again; for it is impossible the elect of God should be finally
deceived: moreover, such as are driven away by the force of persecution,
and scattered abroad, in God's due time have rest, and return to their
folds again; see [Jer 50:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#017.md),

and will bind up that which was broken; such who have broken hearts,
broken with a sense of sin; made truly contrite by the Spirit and grace
of God, through the word; which is a hammer to them, that breaks the
rocky heart in pieces; to these the Lord has respect; their broken
hearts are acceptable to him; he dwells with them, to revive them; he
speaks and restores comforts to them; pours in oil and wine into their
wounds, like the good Samaritan, and binds them up; see [Psa
147:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#003.md) and such who have broken bones,
who have fallen into sin to the breaking of their bones, to the
destroying of their peace, joy, and comfort, as David, Peter, and others
have done; he sets their broken bones, and restores the joys of his
salvation; and causes the bones which were broken to rejoice; at the
discoveries of his pardoning grace and mercy, [Psa
51:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#008.md),

and will strengthen that which was sick; sick through sin, as all men
are; sick of sin, as sensible sinners be; sickly and weak, and ready to
die, as fallen professors, backsliders, are; sick of love, through want
of the discoveries of it; long after them; cannot be easy without them,
as Christ's spouse sometimes is; and sick for want of food, faint and
languid for want of spiritual refreshment; as the persons were Christ
had compassion on, being as sheep without a shepherd, [Mat
9:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#036.md) each of these the Lord
strengthens with the discoveries and applications of pardoning grace;
with the flagons of his love, and apples of his promises; with the food
of the Gospel, which strengthens men's hearts; and with grace out of his
fulness, whereby they are strengthened against sin, snares, and
temptations, and to exercise grace, and do the will of God:

but I will destroy the fat and the strong; that are full of themselves,
lifted up with pride, conceited with their riches or righteousness, and
despise others, whom they thrust with side and shoulder, and push with
their horns, [Eze 34:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#021.md). So the Targum
interprets it of wicked men,

"and I will consume the ungodly and sinners;''

but the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic versions, render
it, "I will keep the fat and the strong"; in the plight and condition in
which they are, and make them still stronger, and more fat and
flourishing; so Jerom interprets it of saints and godly persons; and
this agrees with the preceding clauses; only the original Hebrew text is
against it, which does not admit of a various reading; and this
rendering seems to arise in the Septuagint, the others follow, from the
mistake of a similar letter: "I will feed them with judgment"; meaning
either the whole flock, consisting of fat and lean cattle, making a
distinction between them, [Eze 34:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#017.md),
feeding them with discretion, and judging them according to their
deserts; or else the fat and the strong ones, by inflicting righteous
vengeance on them, feeding them with wormwood and gall; or his own
people and sheep only. So the Targum, "I will govern my people with
judgment"; in righteousness, goodness, truth, and faithfulness.

[Ezekiel 34:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 34:17</span></span>

And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord God,.... Having done
with the shepherds, and the complaint against them, the Lord proceeds to
take notice of the flock, or the people themselves, and the evils that
were among them; for in the Lord's own flock, in the nation and church
of Israel, as now in the visible congregated churches of Christ, there
were two sorts of persons, some good, others bad; some that behaved
well, and others ill; some were sheep, and others goats:

behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he
goats: between the smaller and weaker cattle, the sheep and the lambs;
and the larger and stronger cattle, the rams and he goats; by which
latter may he meant persons of superior power and authority, of greater
wealth and riches, and of more wisdom and knowledge, at least in their
own conceits; and who were oppressive and injurious to the poor and
common people, and less knowing, at least as they thought; who may be
intended by the former: now, the Lord, as he observed a difference
between them, he would make this manifest, and take the part of the one
against the other; even the part of the weaker against the stronger. The
Targum is,

"behold, judge between man and man, sinners and the ungodly.''

[Ezekiel 34:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 34:18</span></span>

Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture,....
This is directed to the rams and he goats, to the people of power and
wealth, or who had the key of knowledge and instruction; who, by their
conduct, showed as if it was not enough for them to eat and drink the
best of things themselves, to enjoy their wealth and riches, and keep
their posts of honour and profit, and the revenues of them, in church
and state:

but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and
to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye must foul the residue with your
feet? but they must oppress the poor, by taking away from them that
little they have; or by making their lives uncomfortable to them, by
their severities and exactions; so that that small pittance they had,
they cannot enjoy with any pleasure, The allusion is to beasts in
pasture, which tread down and put dung what they do not eat, which makes
what is left unfit for others; and to cattle, at ponds of water, which
having drank, foul the rest with their feet; as camels particularly are
said to do; so that others cannot drink after them, at least not so
agreeably: this may be applied to the Scribes and Pharisees, and such as
they were, who devoured widows' houses, and made void the word and
commandments of God, by their traditions; teaching for doctrines the
commandments of men; and so polluted the pure waters of the sanctuary;
defiled the Scriptures of truth, and delivered out such doctrines as
were not food and drink to the souls of men, and yet were obliged to
receive them; and such are heretical persons, who sometimes arise out of
the churches, are a part of the flock, that corrupt the word of God,
pervert the Scriptures, and handle them deceitfully; and may be said to
tread down and trample upon the wholesome truths of the Gospel, and to
muddy the clear doctrines of grace; so that the children of God cannot,
as they desire, have the pure, unmixed, sincere milk of the word.

[Ezekiel 34:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 34:19</span></span>

And as for my flock, they eat that which ye have trodden with your
feet,.... They are forced to do it, not being able to come at any thing
else; being as sheep without a shepherd, or worse:

and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet; which, as it
cannot be agreeable and relishing, so neither wholesome; as the leaven
of the Scribes and Pharisees; the traditions of the elders; the false
doctrines of false teachers, whose words eat as do a canker. The Targum
of the whole verse is,

"and my people eat the residue of the food of your ministers, and drink
the residue of the drink of your ministers.''

[Ezekiel 34:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 34:20</span></span>

Therefore thus saith the Lord God unto them,.... To the rams and he
goats of the flock, that use the pastures and defile the waters after
this manner, and make them unfit for the lesser cattle; or that use the
poor people of God after this sort:

behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat cattle and between the
lean cattle. The Targum is,

"between the rich man and the poor man;''

this is repeated, and in very strong terms, for the confirmation of it:
this the Lord promised to do, and he has done it by his son, to whom he
committed all judgment; and who, in the days of his flesh, made a
difference between those who were full of themselves, self-righteous
persons; who were self-sufficient, and needed not repentance, nor any
other righteousness but their own; who trusted in themselves, and
despised others: and may be meant by the "fat cattle": and between those
who were low and mean in their own eyes, humble and meek, weary and
heavy laden, hungering and thirsting after the righteousness of another:
now for judgment did Christ come, that they which see not might see, and
those who saw might be made blind; he called the one, and not the other,
to repentance; made known the things of the Gospel to babes, and hid
them from the wise and prudent; rejected the one, and had compassion on
the other; see [Joh 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022.md), and when he
comes a second time, he will judge between these, and separate them; and
set the sheep on his right hand, and the goats on the left, [Mat
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031.md).

[Ezekiel 34:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 34:21</span></span>

Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder,.... As the stronger
cattle do the lesser:

and pushed all the diseased with your horns; as horned cattle do those
they dislike, and bear an antipathy to; which to do to the diseased is
great cruelty: sheep, it is said, will take some care of those that are
diseased among them, and bring them to places of sunshine and shelter;
but here the horned part of the flock, and in health, are represented as
acting a barbarous part to the weak and diseased: this may denote such
as are in power and authority, using it to the hurt and detriment of
those that are under them, and whom they should relieve and protect: it
may be applied to the anathemas and excommunications of the Jews, who
pronounced those an accursed and ignorant people that believed in
Christ, and expelled such out of their synagogues that professed his
name; and to their persecutions of the apostles and first Christians:

till he have scattered them abroad; or "without" (s); that is, without
the land. The Targum is,

"through the provinces;''

obliged them to quit their country, and go unto other parts, as the
first preachers of the word did; who, upon the persecution at the death
of Stephen, were scattered abroad everywhere, [Act
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#001.md).

Therefore will I save my flock,.... Or redeem my people, as the Targum;
that is, by his son, after described, as his shepherd and servant:

and they shall no more be a prey: to Satan the roaring lion; nor to such
horned cattle, their persecutors; nor to false teachers, who lie in wait
to deceive; nor shall they ever perish, being the sheep of Christ, hand,
and under the care of him the shepherd, spoken of in the next verse:

and I will judge between cattle and cattle; between man and man, as the

persecuted. See Gill on [Eze 34:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#017.md).

And I will set up one shepherd over them,.... Or governor, as the
Targum; an excellent one of a thousand, the only one; in comparison of
whom others are not to be named; for though there are under shepherds,
as magistrates and ministers of the word, he is the principal one; that
is, Christ, called the good Shepherd, the great Shepherd, and the chief
Shepherd, and the only one; and who became so by the constitution and
appointment of Jehovah the Father; who chose him, called him, and
intrusted him with all his sheep: who sent him to seek and save his lost
sheep; for whom he died, rose again, and is accountable: he is more
particularly called the one Shepherd, with respect to Jew and Gentile;
see [Joh 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#016.md),

and he shall feed them; the flock, even the poor of the flock, thrust at
and pushed by others: he shall feed them by his ministers, as under
shepherds in his churches, where his word is preached, and his
ordinances are administered; he shall feed them with himself, the bread
of life; with his flesh and blood, which are meat and drink indeed; with
covenant grace, blessings, and promises; with the Gospel, and the
doctrines of it; he feeds his babes with milk, his strong men with meat,
and all with the wholesome words of faith and good doctrine, whereby he
nourishes them up to everlasting life; and this he

shall do, not by force, but willingly: it denotes the certainty of it;
it may be depended on:

even my servant David; not David himself literally; who though a
shepherd, and the servant of the Lord, yet had been dead many years
before this prophecy was delivered; nor Zerubbabel, who was of his seed;
for though a servant of the Lord, and a prince or governor of Judah, yet
not a king, and much less a king or prince for ever; as this person is
said to be, [Eze 37:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#024.md), but the
Messiah, as is expressly owned by Kimchi; who says, this is the Messiah
that shall arise from his seed in the time of salvation: he is called
David because his name agrees with him, which signifies "beloved", he
being beloved of God and man; and because the son of David, of his seed
according to the flesh; and because David was an eminent type of him, in
his person, offices, afflictions, wars, victories, and exaltation; and
because he was David's Lord and representative, and in whom his
everlasting kingdom is established. The same is called the servant of
the Lord, as he often is in Scripture, being so in his office capacity
as Mediator; and because he took upon him the form of a servant; did the
work of one; and was of the Lord's choosing, calling, supporting, and
glorifying:

he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd; which is repeated
for the greater confirmation of it.

[Ezekiel 34:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 34:24</span></span>

And I the Lord will be their God,.... The God of them Christ is the
shepherd of, and whom he feeds; the sheep and poor of the flock: this is
the great blessing of the everlasting covenant, and than which there
cannot be a greater, to have the Lord, the everlasting and unchangeable
Jehovah, to be a covenant God and Father:

and my servant David a Prince among them; who should reside among them,
dwell with them, by granting them his spiritual presence, and so rule
over them, protect and defend them; even he who is the Prince of the
kings of the earth, and is exalted, a Prince and a Saviour of his people
Israel; he is such a Shepherd as that he is a Prince; and such a Prince
as that he is a Saviour and under whose princely government is the
greatest safety:

I the Lord have spoken it; and therefore it shall assuredly be. The
Targum is,

"I the Lord have decreed it in my word;''

he had determined it within himself, and promised it in covenant, and
spoke of it in prophecy, and it should be fulfilled.

[Ezekiel 34:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 34:25</span></span>

And I will make with them a covenant of peace,...., Such the covenant of
grace is, made with Christ from everlasting; in which Jehovah proposed
terms of peace, and which Christ undertook to answer, and became the
peacemaker; and from this article concerning the peace and
reconciliation of men the covenant is so called; see [Isa
54:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#010.md), this the Lord promises to make
known to his people his flock, to show them their interest in it, and to
make it good unto them; for otherwise it was made with Christ, and with
them in Christ from all eternity. The Septuagint and Arabic versions
read,

"I will make with David a covenant of peace:''

and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land; which was
literally fulfilled when the Jews returned from Babylon; during their
captivity, the land being uninhabited, evil beasts increased in it, and
possessed it; but upon their return these ceased, being either
destroyed, or driven away: but figuratively these design wicked men,
who, for the malignity of their nature, manners, and conversation, are
called evil beasts, as the Cretians were, [Tit
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#012.md), particularly false teachers may
be designed; those grievous wolves that spare not, but wrong the flock;
but now shall be no more, being either forced to quit their place, or
truly converted; so that the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the
leopard lie down with the kid; which will be the peaceable and
comfortable state of the church in the latter day; when there will be
none to hurt and destroy in the Lord's holy mountain, [Isa
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#006.md),

and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods;
not only in their houses, but in the fields, and even in the wilderness,
and in the woods, where wild beasts used to resort; but now being clear
of all, and under the protection of such a Shepherd and Prince as David
the servant of the Lord, they shall have no dread upon their mind, no
fear of any danger; but dwell in the utmost security, lie down and sleep
in peace and safety, the Lord sustaining them; and whom they shall serve
without fear of any enemy all their days, in righteousness and holiness,
being delivered out of the hands of them all.

[Ezekiel 34:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eze 34:26</span></span>

And I will make them, and the places round about my hill, a
blessing,.... Alluding either to the city of Jerusalem, and the places
adjacent; or to the temple, and the houses about it. So the Targum,

"I will cause them to dwell round about the house of my sanctuary;''

and so Kimchi interprets it of the temple. Some Christian interpreters,
by the "hill" or mountain, understand Christ; and not amiss; who may be
compared to one for height; he being higher than the kings of the earth,
or than the heavens and angels there, as man and Mediator; as well as is
God over all, blessed for ever; and for fruitfulness, from whom the
saints have all theirs, either in grace or good works; and for shade, he
being the shadow of a great rock in a weary land; which yields delight
and refreshment, and is a protection from the heat of a fiery law,
flaming justice, the wrath of God and man, and the fiery darts of Satan;
and for shelter and security, there being salvation in him, when none in
other hills and mountains; and for duration and immovableness, being the
same today, yesterday, and for ever: and now the persons about him are
such who are made nigh by his blood; brought to him by his powerful and
efficacious grace; are worshippers about the throne where he sits; such
as cleave to him, and follow him wherever he goes, and shall be with him
to all eternity; these he makes a blessing, or most blessed. So the
Targum renders it,

"and they shall be blessed;''

they are blessed in Christ their head; they are blessed through him as
their Redeemer and Saviour, who was made a curse for them; they are
blessed through being in him, and by the imputation of blessings to them
from him, and through the application of them by his Spirit; their
persons are blessed, and so are the places or habitations where they
dwell: or rather this may be understood of the church of God, often
compared to a hill for its height and eminence; for its fertility and
fruitfulness; for its stability and firmness; and in allusion to the
hill of Zion for its holiness, and being the place of the divine
residence; see [Psa 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#001.md) now, the
persons about this hill are those who are come to Mount Zion the church
of God; being brought there by the Lord himself, and who take up their
abode there; who lie about this hill, as flocks of sheep, in their
several folds or congregated churches; see [Jer
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#003.md) and these the Lord makes a
blessing to one another, by their spiritual conversation, prayers, and
services of love; and to the world, to kingdoms and states, to cities,
towns, and neighbourhoods, and to particular families, where they are
placed; and even to the world in general; for they are the light, stay,
and stability of it; and without which it would be in darkness, corrupt
and putrefy, and not continue long:

and I will cause the shower to come down in his season; which, in the
spiritual sense, may design the Gospel; which, like a shower of rain,
comes from God; descends from heaven; is a gift of God; which falls
according to divine direction; refreshes, revives, and makes fruitful;
brings a plenty of divine blessings with it; and comes in season, at its
proper time; and is a word in season to weary souls:

there shall be showers of blessings; which the Gospel brings with it;
spiritual blessings, blessings of grace; such as peace, pardon,
righteousness, and eternal life: these, like showers, come from God; are
free grace gifts of his, of which there is a large abundance; and which
descend on Mount Zion the church of God; which is another Gerizim, on
which the blessings are pronounced, [Psa
133:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#003.md).

[Ezekiel 34:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eze 34:27</span></span>

And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit,.... Such as are trees
of righteousness, rooted in Christ, and planted in his church, and
watered with his grace; these bring forth, bear, and are filled with the
fruits of righteousness by him:

and the earth shall yield her increase; the fallow ground of men's
hearts being broke up, and the seed of the word and of divine grace
being sown in them, they bring forth fruit, some thirty, some sixty, and
some an hundred fold; see [Psa 67:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#001.md),
this, and what goes before, may be literally understood of the land of
Canaan, and the fruitfulness of it, when the Jews shall again possess
it; to which the next clause seems to have some respect:

and they shall be safe in their land; no enemy to disturb them, to
invade or do any acts of violence to them: this will be when the Jews
are converted, and become Christians; and antichrist destroyed; they
will have none but Christian powers about them, who will be their
protection. This is true, in a spiritual sense, of all the saints, who
are under the care and government of Christ their Shepherd and Prince:

and shall know that I am the Lord; Jehovah their righteousness, Saviour
and Redeemer:

when I have broken the bands of their yoke; of sin, Satan, and the law,
and of all enemies:

and delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves of
them; or made them their servants, to whom they were subject; literally,
the nations of the world, among whom they are dispersed; and
figuratively, sin, whose servants men in a state of nature are; and
Satan, by whom they are led captive; and the law, under which they are
held as transgressors; and all other spiritual enemies; see [Luk

Jewish nation itself, as the Targum,

"and I will raise up for them a plantation for standing;''

or which shall continue; but of the Messiah, and not of his incarnation,
when he sprung up as a tender plant out of the dry ground, and as a
branch out of the roots of Jesse, being on that account often spoken of
as a branch; see [Isa 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md), but of him
in a more raised and exalted state, as grown up to a stately tree, a
goodly cedar, as in [Eze 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#023.md) when
his interest and kingdom should be great and glorious in the world, as
it will be at the time of the conversion of the Jews; and it is spoken
of his manifestation to them as a plant of renown, or as a renowned
plant, the true vine and tree of life; or as a famous renowned person,
one of name; whose glorious names and titles are Shiloh, the Messiah,
Immanuel, Jehovah our righteousness, Jesus the Saviour, the Word of God,
the King of kings, and Lord of lords:

and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land; the Targum
is,

"they shall no more move from place to place through famine in the
land;''

and which is to be understood, not of hunger through a famine of bread
and water, but of hearing the word of the Lord; which they shall now
have, and hear, and believe, and so have food for their souls, and
hunger no more; as those do not who believe in Christ, [Joh
6:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#035.md), for this plant raised up for
them, and pointed out to them, the tree of life, Christ Jesus, bears all
manner of precious fruit, sweet to the taste, and nourishing to the
souls of his people; under his shadow they sit, and his fruit is sweet
to them; and with him is bread enough, and to spare; so that there is no
want, nor fear of consumption with hunger, where he is:

neither bear the shame of the Heathen any more; being called by them
Jews, in away of taunt, a proverb, and a curse; and outcasts, whom none
seek after; but now they shall no more be termed forsaken, or called
desolate, but instead thereof Hephzibah and Beulah; see [Jer
30:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#017.md).

in a figurative one, of such as were rational and spiritual persons; a
set of men whom the Lord had chosen, and separated from others, as his
peculiar flock; and whom he took a special care of, and led them to, and
fed them in, green pastures of his own providing; they are the souls of
