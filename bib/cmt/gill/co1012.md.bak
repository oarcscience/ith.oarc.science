INTRODUCTION TO 1 CORINTHIANS 12

In this chapter the apostle discourses concerning spiritual gifts,
showing the author, nature, use, and excellency of them; compares the
church to an human body, and in a beautiful manner sets forth the
symmetry and subserviency of the members of it to one another, being set
in different places, and having different gifts; and enumerates the
several offices and gifts in the church, and yet suggests there is
something more excellent than them. He intimates, that spiritual gifts
are valuable things, and should be taken notice of; nor would he have
the saints ignorant of them, and therefore gives the following account,
[Co1 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#001.md) and yet he would not have
those that have them be proud of them, and lifted up with them; for
which reason he puts them in mind of their former state in Heathenism,
to make and keep them humble, [Co1
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#002.md) and points out such who have the
Spirit of God, the author of all gifts and grace; not such who call
Jesus accursed, but they that call him Lord, [Co1
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#003.md) which Holy Ghost, who is called
Spirit, Lord, and God, is the author of the different gifts bestowed
upon men, [Co1 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#004.md) the end of
bestowing which gifts is the profit of others, [Co1
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#007.md) of which gifts there is an
enumeration in nine particulars, [Co1
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#008.md) of each of which the Spirit of
God is the worker and giver, according to his sovereign will and
pleasure, [Co1 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#011.md) and which are all
for the good of the whole community; which is illustrated by the simile
of an human body, which as it consists of many members, and is but one,
so Christ mystical, or the church, though it consists of divers persons,
yet they are all one in Christ, and all their gifts are for the service
of each other, [Co1 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#012.md) which unity
is proved and confirmed by the saints being baptized by one Spirit into
one body, the church, and by drinking of him, or partaking of the same
grace, [Co1 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#013.md) and in order to show
the usefulness and profit of every spiritual gift, even the meanest, to
the churches of Christ, and that none might be despised, he enlarges
upon the metaphor of the human body he had compared the church to, and
by it illustrates the unity of the church, and the members of it, [Co1
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#014.md) and shows that the inferior
members should not envy the superior ones, or be dejected because they
have not the same gifts: and conclude from hence, that they are not, or
deserve not, to be of the same body, [Co1
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#015.md) seeing it is convenient and
absolutely necessary that there should be many members, and these set in
different places, and have different gifts and usefulness; and
particularly what should make them easy is, that God has placed them
according to his will and pleasure, [Co1
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#017.md). And, on the other hand, he
shows, that the more noble, and excellent, and useful members, ought not
to despise the lower, meaner, and more ignoble ones, partly because of
the usefulness and necessity of them, they cannot do without them, [Co1
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#021.md) and partly because of the honour
put upon them, [Co1 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#023.md), and all
this is so ordered, that there be no schism, but that there should be a
mutual care of one member for another, and that they should sympathize
with each other, [Co1 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#025.md). This
simile the apostle more plainly and particularly accommodates and
applies to the church, the body of Christ, and the members of it, and of
one another, [Co1 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#027.md) and gives an
enumeration of the several officers and offices in the church, set there
by God himself; and there are no less than eight of them, some greater
than others, most of them proper and peculiar to the primitive church,
though some perpetual, and which still continue, [Co1
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#028.md) but in the times in which they
were all of them in being and use, every member of the church was not
possessed of them, only some, though all had more or less the advantage
of them, [Co1 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#029.md). Wherefore, he
concludes with an exhortation to the saints to covet the best of those
gifts; and yet observes that there was something more excellent than
them, and preferable to them, which he was about to show them, [Co1
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#031.md) and hereby he makes an easy
transition to the next chapter, in which he recommends charity, and
prefers it to gifts.

[1 Corinthians 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 12:1</span></span>

Now concerning spiritual gifts,.... Though the word "gifts" is not in
the original text, it is rightly supplied by our translators, as it is
in the Arabic version: for the apostle does not mean spiritual graces,
nor spiritual words, or doctrines, nor spiritual meats and drinks, nor
spiritual men, each of which are mentioned before in this epistle;
though the latter is thought by some to be here intended, and that the
apostle's view is to show the difference between those that are
spiritual, and those that are not; but as spiritual gifts are the
subject of the apostle's discourse throughout this chapter, and the two
following, they seem very manifestly to be designed here. The apostle
having gone through various heads of discourse, which he either of
himself, or at the request of others, wrote upon, proceeds to a new
subject, that of spiritual gifts, which he seems to have been desired to
give his thoughts upon, and advice about; since there were some in this
church who were discouraged, because they had not the gifts which some
had; and others that had them were elated and puffed up with them, and
treated those below them with neglect and contempt; and with a view to
both these the apostle writes as follows,

brethren, I would not have you ignorant; neither of the author of these
gifts, who is the Spirit of God, who dispenses them according to his
sovereign will and pleasure, and not according to the deserts of men,
and are not acquired by the industry, or through the merit of any, but
are his free grace gifts; nor of the nature of them, for there are
differences and diversities of them, some have one, and some another,
but no man all; nor of the design and use of them, which is the
edification of the whole body; and every gift, though ever so mean, is
of service; and therefore as, on the one hand, none ought to be
discouraged, so, on the other hand, none should be lifted up with pride,
or give way to a boasting spirit.

[1 Corinthians 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 12:2</span></span>

Ye know that ye were Gentiles,.... That is, by religion; hence the
Syriac version renders it "profane" persons, given up to wickedness,
bigotry, and superstition; for by nation they were Gentiles still; and
which must be understood of one part of this church only; for some of
them were Jews, as is clear from many passages in the epistle to this
church, and practices referred to. This the apostle observes to humble
them, by putting them in mind of what they had been formerly; they were
born and brought up in the Heathen religion, when they knew not the true
God, much less had any knowledge of Christ, and still less of the Spirit
of God; and therefore if they were favoured with any of his gifts, these
must be owing to his grace, and not to their deserts, and therefore they
ought not to glory: he adds, with the same view,

carried away unto these dumb idols; to idols that were nothing in the
world, had no divinity in them, as he had before asserted; to dumb ones,
that had mouths, but could not speak, the oracles that were delivered
from them, being spoken not by them, but were either satanical
delusions, or the jugglings of a priest; to these they were carried by
the power of Satan, the influence of their priests, and the orders of
their magistrates, to consult them as oracles, to pay their devotions to
them, and do them service:

even as ye were led; that is, to these dumb idols; the Syriac adds, ,
"without any difference", not being able to distinguish between these
and the true God; and to whom they were led as brute beasts were, that
were sacrificed unto them, or as blind men are led by the blind, as they
were by their blind and ignorant priests; and therefore, if they had now
received the Spirit, and his gifts, they ought to ascribe the whole to
the free grace of God, and be humble under a sense of their
unworthiness.

[1 Corinthians 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 12:3</span></span>

Wherefore I give you to understand,.... Or "I make known unto you"; what
I am about to say are certain truths, and to be depended on,

that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed; or
"anathema", as did the unconverted Gentiles, who knew nothing of Jesus
but by report; which report they had from the Jews, his enemies; and by
that report he appeared to them to be a very wicked and detestable
person, who was put to death by the means of his own countrymen, was
hanged upon a tree, and so to be counted and called accursed: the
apostle seems to have reference to the sense these Corinthians had of
Jesus, and what they called him before their conversion; whence it
appeared that they spoke not by, nor were they possessed of the Spirit
of God then, and therefore their having of him now was an instance of
pure grace; or else respect is had to the Jews, who not only, whilst
Jesus was living, blasphemed him, but continued to call him accursed
after his death, whilst they were in their own land; and after the
destruction of their city and temple, they continued, as Justin Martyr
observes (a) to Trypho the Jew, to "curse" Christ, and them that
believed in him; and to this day privately call him by such names as
will hardly bear to be mentioned, were it not for the explanation of
such a passage: thus they (b) call him "Jesus the perverse", or he that
perverteth the law of God; and "Jesu", the name they commonly give him,
they say is the abbreviation of , "let his name and memory be blotted
out"; and which they sometimes explain by "Jesu is a lie, and an
abomination: they call him a strange God, and vanity" (c), and often by
the name of (d), "one that was hanged", and so with them accursed; and
which seems to be the name the Jews, in the apostle's time, gave him,
and to which he here refers. Now, as in the former verse he may have
regard to the Gentiles, so in this to the Jews in this church, who,
before conversion, had so called Christ, when it was plain they had not
the Spirit of God then, or they could not have so called him; and
therefore if they were partakers of him now, they ought to admire divine
grace, and not glory in themselves, and over others. Dr. Lightfoot
thinks, that Jewish exorcists who strolled about, and pretended to do
miracles by the Holy Ghost, and yet called Jesus "anathema", are meant,
of whom the Corinthians might assure themselves that they did not speak,
nor act, nor were acted by the Spirit of God. The words may be applied
to all such as detest and deny the doctrines of Christ, respecting his
person and office; as that he is come in the flesh, is the true Messiah,
the Son of God, truly and properly God; that his death is a proper
sacrifice, and full satisfaction for sin; and that justification is by
his imputed righteousness: without any breach of charity it may be said,
such persons do in effect call Jesus accursed, nullifying his person,
sufferings, and death, as to the dignity and efficacy of them; and
cannot be thought to have, and speak by, the Spirit of God, who if they
had him, would teach them otherwise. Moreover, as the word "anathema"
here used answers to "Cherem", a form of excommunication among the Jews;
it may be truly said that such call Jesus accursed, or "anathema", who,
if I may be allowed the expression, excommunicate him out of their
sermons and faith; these crucify him afresh, trample him under foot,
count his blood as a common thing, and do malice to his Spirit; and
therefore cannot be thought to have him, and speak by him.

And that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost;
or Jehovah; which, with the Jews, was a name ineffable, to which the
apostle might have respect. Christ is Lord of all, of angels, good and
bad; of men, righteous and wicked; of the chief among men, the kings,
princes, and lords of the earth; as he is God by right of nature, and as
Creator of them by virtue of that; and because of his providential power
and influence in the government of the universe; he is Lord of his
church and people, by the Father's gift of them to him; by his espousal
of them to himself; by the purchase of his blood; and by the conquests
of his grace; and as appears by the various relations he stands in to
them, as father, husband, head, King, and master. Now, though a man may
historically say all this, as the devils may, and hypocritically, as
formal professors and foolish virgins do now, and will at the last day;
and as all men then will by force, whether they will or not, confess
that Jesus is Lord, who have not the Spirit of God; yet no man can call
him his Lord, can appropriate him to himself truly and really, as his
Lord, Saviour, and Redeemer, as David, Thomas, the Apostle Paul, and
others have done; but by the Spirit; since such an appropriation
includes spiritual knowledge of Christ, strong affection to him; faith
of interest in him, an hearty profession of him, and sincere subjection
to him; all which cannot be without the Spirit of God: for he is the
spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him; and true love
to Christ is a genuine fruit of his; faith in Christ, is entirely of his
operation; and a subjection to the righteousness of Christ, and to his
ordinances, is through the influence of his grace; and it is owing to
his witnessings that any can truly, and in faith, claim their interest
in him. Upon the whole, the apostle's sense is, let a man pretend to
what he will, if he does not love Jesus Christ, and believe in him, he
is destitute of his Spirit; and whoever loves Christ, and believes in
him, and can call him his Lord in faith and fear, however mean otherwise
his gifts may be, he is a partaker of the Spirit of God.

[1 Corinthians 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 12:4</span></span>

Now there are diversities of gifts,.... Of spiritual ones, as in [Co1
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#001.md) which spring from the free grace,
and good will and pleasure of God, and are not owing to the merits of
men; and therefore such who have the largest share of them should not
boast of them as acquired by themselves, or be puffed up on account of
them; and those who have the smallest measure should be content and
thankful; for though the gifts are different, some have greater, and
others lesser, none have all, but all have some, yet not alike:

but the same Spirit; is the author and giver of all as he pleases; the
lesser gifts, and the smallest degree of them, come from the Spirit of
God, as well as the greater. Gifts here seem to be the general name for
all that follow; and

administrations and

operations are the two species of them; and of these a particular
account is afterwards given.

[1 Corinthians 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 12:5</span></span>

And there are differences of administrations,.... Or ministries; offices
in the church, ministered in by different persons, as apostles,
prophets, pastors, or teachers and deacons; who were employed in
planting and forming of churches, ordaining elders, preaching the word,
administering ordinances, and taking care of the poor; for which
different gifts were bestowed on them, they not all having the same
office.

But the same Lord; meaning either Jesus Christ, whom the believer, by
the Holy Ghost, says is Lord; who, as the ascended King of saints, and
Lord and head of the church, appoints different offices and officers in
it; and having received, gives gifts unto them, qualifying them for the
same; all which comes through the same hand, and not another's; or
rather the Lord, the Spirit, who calls men to these several
ministrations, separates and fits them for them, and constitutes and
installs them into them, and assists them in the discharge of them;
since he only, and all along, is spoken of in the context as the
efficient of these several things.

[1 Corinthians 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 12:6</span></span>

And there are diversities of operations, There are some that are
ordinary, as the good work of grace, and the several parts of it, the
work of faith, the labour of love, and patience of hope, which the
Spirit of God begins, carries on, and finishes in all the elect of God,
and members of Christ; and there are others which are extraordinary, and
are here meant, and hereafter specified.

But it is the same God which worketh all in all. Interpreters in general
understand by God here, God the Father; as by the Lord in the preceding
verse, the Lord Jesus Christ, as distinct from the Spirit in [Co1
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#004.md) and apprehend that this furnishes
out a considerable proof of a trinity of persons in the Godhead, which I
will not deny; but I rather think that the Holy Ghost is designed in
each verse, by Spirit, Lord, and God; since the various gifts,
administrations, and operations, are particularly and peculiarly
ascribed to him in the following verses; and the distribution of them is
said to be the effect of his sovereign will; and so we have a most
illustrious testimony of his proper deity and personality; who is the
only true "Jehovah" with the Father and Son, to which the word "Lord" in
the New Testament generally answers, and who is the omnipotent God,
"which worketh all in all"; all the works of nature throughout the
universe, and all the, works of grace in the hearts of all his people,
and all the extraordinary operations effected by any of them.

[1 Corinthians 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 12:7</span></span>

But the manifestation of the Spirit,.... Not that which the Spirit
manifests, as the grace and love of God, an interest in Christ, the
doctrines of the Gospel, and the things of another world; for he is a
spirit of revelation, more or less, in the knowledge of these things;
but that which manifests that a man has the Spirit of God; or rather the
gifts of the Spirit, as the fruits and graces of the Spirit, the least
measure of which, as being able to say that Jesus is Lord, shows that a
man has the Spirit of God; or rather the gifts of the Spirit, ordinary
or extraordinary, which are such as manifestly declare their author:

is given to every man; not that the special grace of the Spirit is given
to every individual man in the world, nor to every member of a visible
church, for some are sensual, not having the Spirit; but as the same
graces of the Spirit are given to every regenerate man, for all receive
the same spirit of faith, so the gifts of the Spirit, more or less,
either ordinary or extraordinary, are given to all such persons;

to profit withal; not to make gain of, as Simon Magus intended, could he
have been possessed of them; nor to encourage pride or envy, or to form
and foment divisions and parties; but for profit and advantage, and that
not merely private, or a man's own, but public, the good of the whole
community or church, to which the least grace or gift, rightly used, may
contribute.

[1 Corinthians 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 12:8</span></span>

For to one is given by the Spirit,.... Now follows a distinct and
particular enumeration of the operations of the Spirit, though not all
of them, yet as many as the apostle thought necessary; and which are
called the manifestation of him, and which most clearly show him to be
the author of them to different persons;

the word of wisdom: by which is meant "the manifold wisdom of God"; the
wonderful scheme of salvation through the incarnation, sufferings, and
death of Christ, in which God has "abounded in all wisdom and prudence";
together with all other deep, mysterious, and sublime doctrines of the
Gospel, the knowledge of which were peculiarly given to the apostles in
the first place, who have the first office or ministry in the church, by
"the spirit of wisdom"; and which they had a faculty, a gift of
declaring, opening, and explaining unto others.

To another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; meaning either
knowledge of future events; or an universal knowledge of the Scriptures
of truth, and the doctrines contained in them, of the whole mind and
will of God therein, which is a distinct thing from saving grace: see
[Co1 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#002.md) and is what was given to the
prophets, the second office in the church, by him who is the spirit of
prophecy, and by whom the prophetical writings were dictated; and
therefore he is the best interpreter of them, and who only can lead into
the true knowledge thereof.

[1 Corinthians 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 12:9</span></span>

To another faith by the same Spirit,.... Not the grace of faith, which
is common to all believers, though given by the same Spirit: but rather
the doctrine of faith, and ability to preach it, and boldness and
intrepidity of spirit to assert and defend it in the face of all
opposition; all which are from the Spirit of God, and are more or less
given to pastors and teachers, the third office in the church. Though
generally this is understood of a faith of working miracles, as in [Co1
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#002.md) but the working of miracles is
mentioned afterwards as distinct, unless it can be thought that this is
the general name for miracles, and the rest that follow the particulars
of them.

To another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; of healing all
manner of sicknesses and diseases: this power Christ gave his disciples,
when he first sent them out to preach the Gospel, and which he repeated
when he renewed and enlarged their commission after his resurrection;
and which was exercised with effect, sometimes only by overshadowing the
sick with their shadows, as by Peter, [Act
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#015.md) sometimes by, laying hands on
them, as the father of Publius, and others, were healed by Paul, [Act
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#008.md) and sometimes by anointing with
oil, [Jam 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#014.md). Now these gifts were
bestowed in common, by the Spirit, on apostles, prophets, and pastors,
or elders of the church, in those early times: the Alexandrian copy, and
the Vulgate Latin version, read, "by one Spirit".

[1 Corinthians 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 12:10</span></span>

To another the working of miracles,.... Or "powers": mighty deeds,
wonderful works, such as are apparently above, and out of the reach of
nature, and beyond the compass of human power and skill; such as raising
the dead, causing the blind to see, the deaf to hear, the dumb to speak,
the lame to walk, and the like; of which, see some instances in [Act
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#006.md). Though others understand by these
the extraordinary powers the apostles had of punishing offenders; of
which the striking Ananias and Sapphira dead, by Peter, the smiting
Elymas the sorcerer with blindness, by Paul, and the delivering the
incestuous person, and Hymenaeus, and Alexander, to Satan, by the same
apostle, are instances.

To another prophecy: either foretelling of future events, as was given
to Agabus, and the four daughters of Philip, and others, [Act
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#027.md) or a gift of understanding the
prophecies of the Old Testament, and of preaching the Gospel, which is
in this epistle frequently called "prophesying", particularly in the two
following chapters; and those endowed with it are called prophets, [Act
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#001.md).

To another discerning of spirits; by which gift such that were possessed
of it could, in some measure, discern the hearts of men, their thoughts,
purposes, and designs, their secret dissimulation and hypocrisy; as
Peter, by this gift, discerned the dissimulation and lying of Ananias
and Sapphira; and by it they could also tell whether a man that made a
profession of religion had the truth of grace in him, or not; so Peter
knew hereby that Simon Magus was in the gall of bitterness, and bond of
iniquity, notwithstanding his specious pretences to faith and holiness,
whereby he imposed upon Philip the evangelist, who might not have this
gift of discerning spirits; by which also they could distinguish the
Spirit of God from the lying spirits in men; of which there is an
instance, [Act 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#017.md).

To another divers kinds of tongues; whereby such could speak all manner
of languages, which they had never learned, understood, and been used
to: this Christ promised his disciples, when he sent them into all the
world to preach the Gospel, [Mar 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#016.md)
and so anticipates an objection they otherwise might have made, how they
should be able to preach it to all, so as to be understood, when they
were not acquainted with the languages of all nations; an instance of
which we have in the apostles on the day of Pentecost, [Act
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#004.md) and which continued many years
after with them, and other persons in the churches; see [Co1
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#002.md).

To another the interpretation of tongues; one that had this gift, when a
discourse was delivered in an unknown tongue, used to stand up and
interpret it to the people, without which it could be of no use to them;
and sometimes a person was gifted to speak in an unknown tongue, and yet
was not capable of interpreting his discourse truly and distinctly in
that the people understood: see [Co1
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#013.md). The rules to be observed in
such cases, and by such persons, see in [Co1
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#027.md).

[1 Corinthians 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 12:11</span></span>

But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit,.... Though these
gifts, ministrations, and operations, are so different in themselves,
and are bestowed upon different persons, yet they are all wrought by one
and the same Spirit of God, who is the true Jehovah, and properly God,
as these his works declare; for who, but the most high God, could ever
communicate such gifts to men?

Dividing to every man severally as he will; giving one man this gift,
and another that; imparting such a measure to one, and such a portion to
another, just as seems good in his sight. For as his special grace in
regeneration is dispensed when and where, and to whom he pleases,
signified by the blowing of the wind where it listeth, [Joh
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#008.md) so his gifts, ordinary and
extraordinary, are severally distributed, according to his sovereign
will and pleasure. This is a clear and full proof of the personality of
the Spirit, who is not only distinguished from his gifts, and the
distribution of them, which is a personal act described to him; but this
is said to be done according to his will, which supposes him an
intelligent agent, capable of choosing and willing; and whose will
agrees with the Father's, and with the Son's.

For as the body is one,.... That is, an human body; for of this the
apostle speaks, and takes a simile, and forms a comparison from, showing
the union among saints, and their mutual participation of the various
gifts of the Spirit; for an human body is but one body, and not more.

And hath many members; as eyes, ears, hands, feet, &c.

And all the members of that one body being many are one body; as
numerous as they may be, they all belong to, and make up but one body;
performing different offices, for which they are naturally fitted for
the good of the whole:

so also to Christ; not personal, but mystical; not the head alone, or
the members by themselves, but head and members as constituting one
body, the church. The church, in union with Christ, the head, is but one
general assembly, and church of the firstborn written in heaven, though
consisting of the various persons of God's elect, who are closely united
one to another, and their head Christ; and therefore are denominated
from him, and called by his name; see [Rom
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003.md).

[1 Corinthians 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 12:13</span></span>

For by one Spirit are we all baptized,.... This is to be understood not
of water baptism; for the apostle says not in one, and the same water,
but "by", or "in" one Spirit, are we all baptized; the baptism of water,
and of the Spirit, are two different things; see [Mat
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011.md). Besides, all that are baptized
in water, are not baptized in or by the Spirit, as the case of Simon
Magus, and that of others, show; nor does water baptism incorporate
persons into the church of Christ; neither into the invisible church,
which is the body of Christ, and here meant; nor into a visible Gospel
church state; they being indeed true believers, and baptized, are proper
persons to be received into a church; but baptism itself does not put
them into it, or make them members of it: persons may be baptized in
water, and yet may never be joined to a church. There is indeed an
allusion made to water baptism, but it is the grace of the Spirit in
regeneration and sanctification which is here intended; which grace,
both in the Old and in the New Testament, is frequently signified by
water, and called a baptism, or a being baptized, because of the plenty,
abundance, and superabundance of it, then bestowed; and is expressed by
floods and rivers, and a well of living water; and is what qualifies and
fits persons for the ordinance of water baptism. Now this is wrought by
the Spirit of God, and is owing to his divine power and energy; not to
water baptism, which has no regenerating virtue in it; nor to carnal
regeneration, or a being born of blood, or of the best of men; nor to
the will of any man; nor to the will of the flesh, or the power of man's
freewill; but to God, to the Spirit, who is Lord and God, and the only
sanctifier of the sons of men; by which spiritual baptism, or by whose
grace in regeneration and conversion they are brought into one body: the
mystical body of Christ, the universal and invisible church; that is,
openly and manifestatively; for otherwise it is the grace of God in
election, and in the everlasting covenant, choosing them in Christ, as
members in their head, and constituting them such, that puts them among
that number; but spiritual baptism, or the sanctifying grace of the
Spirit, makes them appear to belong to that body, and makes them meet
for, and gives them a right unto, a particular Gospel church, and the
privileges of it, which the Spirit of God directs and brings them to.
Whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; it matters
not of what nation, or of what state and condition of life persons be;
if they are regenerated and sanctified, they appear equally to belong to
Christ, to be of his body, and have an equal propriety in all immunities
and blessings belonging to his people; see [Col
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#011.md)

and have been all made to drink into one Spirit; are all partakers of
the same graces of the Spirit, as faith, hope, love, &c. and daily
receive under his guidance, direction, and influence, out of the same
fulness of grace in Christ, from whence they draw and drink this water
with joy; and all drink the same spiritual drink, the blood of Christ,
whose blood is drink indeed: and there may be in this clause an allusion
to the ordinance of the supper, as in the former to the ordinance of
baptism. Moreover, all new born babes, as they desire the sincere milk
of the word, so they drink of it, and are refreshed with it, and are
nourished by the words of faith, and sound doctrine, under the
application, of the Spirit; and being trees of righteousness, and the
planting of the Lord, the Spirit, they are watered by his grace, under
the ministrations of the Gospel; and as they become one body under
Christ, the head, so they are made to drink into one Spirit, or to
become of one heart and soul with one another, being knit together in
love, the bond of perfectness.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co1 12:14</span></span>

For the body is not one member,.... Not only one; nor is anyone member
the body, though ever so eminent, as the head or eye: thus the church of
Christ is not one person only, or does not consist of one sort of
persons; as only of Jews, or only of Gentiles, or only of rich and
freemen, or only of men of extraordinary gifts and abilities, or greatly
eminent for grace and spiritual knowledge:

but many; members, as the Arabic version adds; as eyes, ears, hands,
feet, &c. so in the mystical body of Christ, the church, there are many
members, some in a higher station, others in a lower; some of greater
gifts, grace, and usefulness, others of lesser; some Jews, other
Gentiles; some bond, others free; yet all one in Christ the head, and
all related to each other.

[1 Corinthians 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co1 12:15</span></span>

If the foot shall say,.... The lowest member of the body, which is
nearest the earth, treads upon it, sustains the whole weight of the
body, and performs the more drudging and fatiguing exercises of standing
and walking; and may represent one that is in the lowest station in the
church, a doorkeeper in the house of God; one that is really the least
of saints, as well as thinks himself so; and has the smallest degree of
heavenly affection, and knowledge of spiritual light and understanding;

because I am not the hand; the instrument of communication and of
action; and may signify such an one, that liberally imparts to the
necessities of others, who has it both in his hand and heart, and is
ready to communicate; one that is full of good works, of charity towards
men, and piety towards God; who does all things, Christ strengthening
him, natural, civil, moral, and evangelical; yea, even miracles and
mighty deeds are done by his hand:

I am not of the body; have no part in it, am no member of it, do not
belong to it:

is it therefore not of the body? or "it is not therefore not of the
body", as the Syriac version renders it; that is, it is not "for this
word", as the Arabic, or so saying, as the Ethiopic, not of the body; it
nevertheless belongs to it, and is a member of it, nor can it be
otherwise: thus the meanest person in the mystical body, the church,
though he should say, that because he is not so handy and useful as
another, cannot give so largely, nor do so much as another, therefore he
is no proper member of the church; it does not follow that so it is, for
Christ, the head of the church, regards such as members; he admires the
"beauty" of his church's "feet", and has provided for the covering,
ornament, and security of them, being himself clothed with "a garment
down to the feet", which equally covers and adorns that part of the body
as the rest; he does not break the bruised reed, nor quench the smoking
flax, or despise the day of small things; he regards their prayers, and
takes notice and accepts of their meanest services; and they are, and
should be considered as members of the body, by the rest and by
themselves, the mystical body, the church, though he should say, that
because he is not so handy and useful as another, cannot give so
largely, nor do so much as another, therefore he is no proper member of
the church; it does not follow that so it is, for Christ, the head of
the church, regards such as members; he admires the "beauty" of his
church's "feet", and has provided for the covering, ornament, and
security of them, being himself clothed with "a garment down to the
feet", which equally covers and adorns that part of the body as the
rest; he does not break the bruised reed, nor quench the smoking flax,
or despise the day of small things; he regards their prayers, and takes
notice and accepts of their meanest services; and they are, and should
be considered as members of the body, by the rest and by themselves.

And if the ear shall say,.... The organ that receives sounds, and can
distinguish them, and in which member is placed the sense of hearing;
and may design such as are hearers of the word of God, not merely
externally, but internally; who hear so as to love, savour, and relish
it; so as to understand and believe it, and to act in compliance with
it; and distinguish it for themselves, though they may not be able to
give a distinct account of it to others, or instruct others in it:

because I am not the eye: the organ of seeing, in which is seated the
visive faculty, and which receives light, and uses it for the good of
the body, whose superintendent it is; and may be expressive of the
ministers of the Gospel, who are that to the church, as eyes are to the
body; they are the light of the world, have a clear insight into the
doctrines of the Gospel, and communicate their light to others; they are
set in the highest place in the church, and as watchmen and overseers
there, to instruct; guide, and direct the members of it:

I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the body? it certainly is;
and so such as are only hearers of the Gospel, being affectionate,
believing, understanding and fruitful hearers; though they have not such
large knowledge and clear light, so as to be capable of overseeing and
instructing others, yet are true and useful members of the church, are
highly respected by Christ the head, and to be had in esteem by their
fellow members, who may be superior to them.

[1 Corinthians 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co1 12:17</span></span>

If the whole body were an eye,.... And nothing else,

where were the hearing? there would be no ear, and so no sense of
hearing: and if the whole were hearing: or only consisted of a member
capable of the sense of hearing,

where were the smelling? there would be no nose, the organ of smelling,
and that sense would be wanting: thus if the church only consisted of
ministers of the Gospel, of men of eminent light and knowledge,
qualified for the preaching of the word to others, there would be no
hearers; and on the other hand, if it only consisted of hearers, of such
who only could hear the word to their own advantage, there would be none
of a quick understanding, or of a quick smell to discern perverse
things, to distinguish truth from error, to discern spirits, and direct
the rest of the members to wholesome and savoury food, and preserve them
from what would be hurtful and pernicious to them.

[1 Corinthians 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co1 12:18</span></span>

But now hath God set the members,.... The members of a natural body, as
they are all made and fashioned by God in the form they be, so they are
each of them set by him in the place they are:

everyone of them in the body as it hath pleased him; according to his
sovereign will, without consulting any; and each stands in the best
situation and position they could be put, and for the greatest service
and usefulness to the whole: so God, and not man, hath set every member
in the mystical body, the church, in such a place and part of it, as he
himself thought fit; some in a higher, others in a lower station, but
all for the good of the body; and therefore each member ought to be
content with his place, gift, and usefulness, be they what they will;
since it is the wise counsel and sovereign pleasure of God, who works
all things after the counsel of his own will, that so it should be.

[1 Corinthians 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co1 12:19</span></span>

And if they were all one member,.... As all eye, or all ear, or all
hand, or all foot:

where were the body? where would be the body? it would not be a body
consisting of such proper and suitable members, as now it is: so if the
community of the saints were either all ministers, or all hearers, &c.
there would be no body, consisting of different persons, to receive any
benefit or usefulness from either; the church of Christ would not be
that uniform, useful, and consistent community it is.

[1 Corinthians 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co1 12:20</span></span>

But now are they many members,.... Of different make and shape, in
different parts and places, and of different use and service:

yet but one body; all are united together, and make up one complete
body, and which without each of them would not be perfect: so there are
many members in the body of Christ, the church; some are teachers,
others are hearers; some give, and others receive; but all make up but
one church, of which Christ is the head; nor can anyone of them be
spared; was anyone wanting, even the meanest, there would be a
deficiency, and the church would not be the fulness of him that filleth
all in all.

[1 Corinthians 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co1 12:21</span></span>

And the eye cannot say unto the hand,.... Every member of the natural
body is useful and necessary. The eye, the seat of the sense of seeing,
cannot say to the communicating and working hand,

I have no need of thee: I can do without thee: so the seers and
overseers of the church, the ministers of the Gospel, cannot say to the
liberal and munificent hands, we have no need of you; for as the one
stand in need of the light, instruction, comfort, advice, and direction
of the other, so the other stand in need of communication from them; and
as God has made it a duty, that he that is taught in the word should
communicate to him that teacheth in all good things; and as it is his
ordinance that they which preach the Gospel should live of it; so he has
generally ordered it in his providence, that they that teach should need
such assistance:

nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. The head, which
is the seat of the senses, and is superior to, and has the command and
government of all the members of the body, cannot say to the lowest and
most distant parts of it, the feet, you are needless and useless; so
those that are set in the first place in the church, are over others in
the Lord, and have the rule over them, cannot say to those that are
under them, and submit unto them, even the lowest and meanest of them,
that they are of no use and service to them; they can no more be without
them, than the head can be without the feet, or than princes can do
without subjects, or magistrates without citizens, or generals without
soldiers.

[1 Corinthians 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">co1 12:22</span></span>

Nay, much more those members of the body,.... The apostle, in a
beautiful gradation, proceeds to take notice of such parts of the body
as are more weak, dishonourable, and uncomely, showing the necessity and
usefulness of them:

which seem to be more feeble; than others, do not consist of a strong
bony substance, and are not fenced with sinews, as the belly and its
intestines: yet these

are necessary; nor could the body be sustained, nourished, and
refreshed, without them; so the more weak and feeble saints, whose
hearts and hands are to be strengthened, whose infirmities are to be
bore, have their usefulness; and the effectual working in the measure of
every part, even of the feeble and tender, maketh increase of the body,
to the edifying of itself in love: and these God has seen fit, as
necessary to call by his grace, and place in the body, that his strength
may be made perfect in their weakness, and to confound the mighty; and
out of the mouths even of babes and sucklings to ordain strength and
praise.

[1 Corinthians 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">co1 12:23</span></span>

And those members of the body,.... As the back parts of it:

which we think to be less honourable; though greatly useful,

upon these we bestow more abundant honour; by clothing them, for a man's
garments are his honour and glory; See Gill on [Mat
6:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#029.md), so the poor members of Christ's
church, who are thought to be, though they really are not, the less
honourable, have the more abundant honour conferred on them by God and
Christ: God has chosen the poor of this world; Christ has sent his
Gospel to them; these the Spirit calls and sanctifies, and makes them
all glorious within; these Christ has given his churches a particular
charge to take care of now, and will own them as his brethren at the
great day, before angels and men; as he now greatly honours them with
his presence, a large experience of his grace, and the supply of his
Spirit:

and our uncomely parts; which distinguish sexes, and are appointed for
generation;

have more abundant comeliness; by an external covering and ornament, to
preserve decency and modesty. I do not know who should be designed by
these, unless backsliding believers, who have been suffered to fall into
great sins; these are the uncomely parts of the church, who, when made
sensible of their evils, are restored again, and received into the
church; and a mantle of love is cast over all their failings; and all
possible care taken that their faults may not be exposed to the world,
that so the name of God, and ways of Christ, may not be blasphemed and
evil spoken of.

[1 Corinthians 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">co1 12:24</span></span>

For our comely parts have no need,.... As the face, eyes, nose, lips,
cheeks, &c. which stand in no need of an external covering, of any
outward ornament: so such as are blessed with the bounties of nature and
providence, with the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and are eminent for grace
and holiness, and are enabled to walk worthy of their calling, and to
have their conversations as become the Gospel of Christ, holding the
mystery of the faith in a pure conscience, these have no need of such a
covering, as the former have, to hide and conceal them from the world:

but God hath tempered the body together; he hath composed it in such a
forth, constituted it in such an order, mixed and united all its parts
in such a manner, as that they are all beneficial to each other; and
such is the harmonious contexture of the whole, that it is a most
beautiful structure:

having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked; or, as the
Syriac version renders it, "which is the least"; and such is the
temperament and constitution of the church, having mixed rich and poor
persons, of greater and lesser gifts, together, for mutual good.

[1 Corinthians 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">co1 12:25</span></span>

That there should be no schism in the body..... No complaint of one
member against another, as useless and unnecessary; no murmuring on that
account; no tumults and rioting; no rebellion and insurrection of one
against another; no dissension, no division. The use Menenius (e)
Agrippa made of this simile, applying it to the body politic, as the
apostle here does to the spiritual body, for the appeasing of a sedition
among the people; is well known, and usually mentioned by interpreters
on this place:

but that the members should have the same care one for another; that is,
they are so tempered and mixed together, are in such close union with,
and have such a dependence on each other, that they are necessarily
obliged to take care of each other's good and welfare, because they
cannot do one without another; and so God has ordered it in the church,
that persons should be so placed in it, and gifts disposed of among them
in such a manner, that every man is obliged, not only to look on, and be
concerned for his own things, that he takes care of himself, and
performs his office, but that he looks every man on the things of
others, his good and safety being involved in theirs.

And whether one member suffer,.... Pain; even the meanest, lowest, and
most distant, as the foot or hand, toe or finger:

all the members suffer with it; are more or less affected therewith, and
bear part of the distress; as is easily discerned, by their different
forms and motions on such an occasion: so when anyone member of the
mystical body is in affliction, whether inward or outward, of body or
mind, the rest are, or should be, affected with it, condole, sympathize,
help, and assist; and remember them that are in bonds, as bound with
them, as if they themselves were in bonds, and them that suffer
adversity, whether spiritual or temporal, as being in the body, not only
in the flesh, but as being part of the body, the church; and therefore
should weep with them that weep, and bear a part with them in their
sorrows. The Jews have a saying (f), that

"if one brother dies, all the brethren grieve; and if one of a society
dies, , "the whole society grieves";''

and also another (g),

"that everyone that afflicts himself, , "with the congregations", is
worthy to see or enjoy the comfort of the congregation or church;''

or one member be honoured; by being set in the highest place, and
employed to the greatest usefulness, or by being most richly and
beautifully clothed and adorned:

all the members rejoice with it; as sharing in the honour, Or benefit of
it: so if one member of the church of Christ is honoured with an high
office, with great gifts, with a large measure of grace, spiritual
light, knowledge, and experience, with great discoveries of the love of
God, with the presence of Christ, and the communion of the Holy Ghost,
or with the good things of this life, and an heart to make use of them
for the interest of religion, the other members rejoice at it; for so it
becomes the saints to rejoice with them that rejoice, and be glad, both
at the temporal and spiritual prosperity of each other: and upon the
whole it is clear, that the meanest have no reason to be discouraged,
nor the highest and greatest to be proud and elated.

Now ye are the body of Christ,.... Not his natural body, which his
Father prepared for him, in which he bore our sins on the tree, and
which was offered up once for all; nor his sacramental body, or the
bread in the supper, which is a representation of his body; but his body
mystical, the church; not that the Corinthians were the whole of the
body, only a part of it, as every single congregational church is of the
church universal. This is an accommodation of the simile the apostle had
to so much advantage enlarged upon:

and members in particular; or in part: meaning either that they as
single members were part of the general body: or that only a part of
them were so, there being some among them, as in all particular and
visible churches, who had not the true grace of God; and so are neither
members of Christ, nor of the general assembly and church of the
firstborn: or the sense is, that they were not only members of Christ,
and of his body, but were particularly members one of another, in strict
union and close communion, and of mutual use and service to each other.

[1 Corinthians 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">co1 12:28</span></span>

And God hath set some in the church,.... As before the apostle gives an
account of the various different gifts of the Spirit, qualifying men for
service in the church of Christ, here he enumerates the several offices
and officers:

first apostles; as were the twelve disciples, and Paul the apostle; men
that were immediately sent by Christ himself, and had their commission
and doctrine directly from him; and a power of working miracles, to
confirm the truth of their mission and ministry; they were sent into all
the world to preach the Gospel, to plant churches everywhere, and to
ordain officers in them; they were not confined to any particular
church, but had power and authority in all the churches, to preach the
word, administer ordinances, advise, counsel, direct, reprove, and
censure:

secondarily, prophets; who either had the gift of foretelling things to
come, as Agabus and others; or who had a peculiar gift, by divine
revelation, of explaining the prophecies of the sacred writings, and of
preaching the Gospel:

thirdly, teachers; the same with pastors, elders, and overseers; the
ordinary ministers of the word, who have a gift of expounding the
Scriptures; not by extraordinary revelation, but by the ordinary gift of
the Spirit, in the use of means, as reading, meditation, and prayer; and
whose work is to preach the word, administer ordinances, feed and govern
particular churches, over whom they are set: after that miracles; which
is to be understood, not of some persons, as distinct from apostles,
prophets, and teachers, who also had the power of working miracles; but
from persons and officers in the church, the principal of which the
apostle had mentioned, he passes to things, which belonged at least to
some of them; unless it can be thought that there were in those times
private Christians, who were neither apostles nor prophets, nor
teachers, and yet had a power of doing miracles:

then gifts of healing; the sick, by anointing them with oil, which was
only one species of doing miracles; and which was sometimes performed,
not only by apostles, and such like extraordinary persons, but by the
common elders and ordinary officers of the church:

helps: meaning either the ministers of the word in common, who are
helpers of the faith and joy of the saints, and are means of increasing
their knowledge and spiritual experience, and of establishing them in
the truth; see [Act 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#027.md) or else such
evangelists and ministers of the word as were assistants to the
apostles, such as Mark, and Timothy, and Titus; or rather the deacons of
churches, whose business it is to take care of tables; the Lord's table,
the minister's, and the poor's, and all the secular affairs of the
church; and so are helps to the minister, relieve him, and free him from
all worldly concerns, that he may the better attend to prayer, and the
ministry of the word. These, whether one or the other, are so called, in
allusion to the priests and Levites, who were "helps", or assistants to
the high priest, in the burning of the red heifer, and in other things
(h):

governments; some by these understand the same with pastors and elders,
who have the rule and government of the church; others lay elders, a
sort of ruling elders in the church, as distinct from pastors. Dr.
Lightfoot thinks such are intended, who had the gift of discerning
spirits. I rather think with De Dieu, that the word designs counsellors;
see the Septuagint in [Pro 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#014.md) and
here intends such as are men of wisdom and prudence, who are very proper
persons to be consulted and advised with, by the pastor, elder, or
overseer, in matters of moment and importance in the church:

diversities of tongues; such as have the gift of speaking with divers
tongues; or of interpreting them, or both. The Vulgate Latin version and
some copies add, "interpretations of tongues".

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">co1 12:29</span></span>

Are all apostles?.... No some are prophets, as distinct from apostles;
and some are teachers, as distinct from them both, and some are neither:

are all prophets? no; some are apostles, above them, and some are
teachers, inferior to them; and but very few there were who had that
peculiar character and gift:

are all teachers? no; the far greater part of the members of churches
are hearers, or persons that are taught in the word; are neither in the
office of teaching, nor have they the qualifications for it.

Are all workers of miracles? no; in those early times, when the gift of
doing miracles was bestowed, it was not given to all, only to some; and
now there are none that are possessed of it.

Have all the gifts of healing?.... No; when these gifts were in being,
all had them not. When anointing with oil, in order to heal the sick,
was in use, it was only performed by the elders of the church, not by
the common members of it, who were to be sent for by the sick on this
occasion:

do all speak with tongues? no; it was not true in fact, as they well
knew; though this was greatly coveted after, as a following chapter of
this epistle shows;

do all interpret? that is, unknown tongues, strange languages; or can
they? no. This also was a peculiar gift bestowed on some persons only.

[1 Corinthians 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">co1 12:31</span></span>

But covet earnestly the best gifts,.... Which may be rendered either
indicatively as an assertion, "ye do covet earnestly the best gifts": of
prophesying and teaching, of doing miracles, healing diseases, speaking
with, and interpreting, different tongues and languages; but I can, and
do show you something that is better, and more excellent than these: or,
by way of interrogation, "do ye covet earnestly the best gifts?" do you
zealously affect them, fervently desire them, and emulate one another in
your endeavours after them? I have something to observe to you which
exceeds them all, and which you would do well to follow after, and
eagerly pursue; or imperatively, as an exhortation, as it is rendered by
our translators: and by the best gifts may be meant, the best of these
external gifts before mentioned; and not those of the highest class, and
the more extraordinary, but which are the most useful and beneficial to
the church, as preaching or prophesying was: the Corinthians seemed most
covetous and desirous of speaking with different tongues; but the
apostle shows, in [Co1 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001.md), by divers
reasons, that prophesying was preferable, being more serviceable and
useful to the church, and so more eligible and to be desired by them, to
which he may have regard here: or else by them are meant the internal
graces of the Spirit, as faith, hope, and love, which are all of them
gifts of God's grace; all useful and valuable, and better than all
external extraordinary gifts whatever, which a man might have, and be
nothing, be lost and damned; whereas he that believes in Christ, has a
good hope through grace, and love in his soul to God, Christ, and his
people, though he is destitute of the other gifts, shall certainly be
saved; wherefore these are the gifts which men should be solicitous for
and covet after, and be greatly concerned to know that they have them,
and to be content without the other:

and yet show I unto you a more excellent way: if by the best gifts are
designed the above graces of the Spirit, then by "the more excellent
way", Christ must be meant, the author and object of these graces; who
is the way to the covenant, and to a participation of all the blessings
of it, as justification, pardon, adoption, and eternal life; the way
into a Gospel church, and to all the ordinances of the Gospel
dispensation, as baptism, and the Lord's supper; for faith in him is the
prerequisite, and proper qualification for the enjoyment of each of
these: Christ is the way of salvation, and the way to the Father, and to
heaven and eternal happiness; and an excellent one he is, the more, yea,
the most excellent; he is the only way to each of these; he is the new
and living way, a plain and pleasant one; and so a safe and secure one,
in which all that walk shall certainly be saved: now this way the
apostle showed, declared, pointed out in the ministry of the word; it
was his chief and principal business, the sum of his doctrine, to make
known Christ, and him crucified, as the way, the truth, and the life; to
direct souls to him, and to show them the way of salvation by him: but
if by the best gifts are meant the more useful ones of those before
mentioned, as prophesying, or preaching, then the more excellent way
designs grace, special and internal grace; and that either grace in
general, regenerating, sanctifying grace, including all sorts of grace;
which is the way of a soul's passing from the death of sin to a life of
faith and holiness; and is the way to eternal glory, and which gives a
meetness for it, and is inseparably connected with it. This is a more
excellent way than gifts; for gifts, be they ever so great, may be lost
or taken away, through disuse or misimprovement; but grace always
remains, can never be lost, nor will ever be taken away, but will issue
in everlasting life: men may have the greatest gifts, and yet not be
saved, as Judas and others; but he that has the least degree of faith in
Christ, hope in him, and love to him, shall be saved by him with an
everlasting salvation: or particularly the grace of charity, or love to
the saints, may be intended by the more excellent way; which is the
evidence of a man's passing from death and life; the new commandment of
Christ, and the fulfilling of the law; without which, a man, though he
has never such great gifts, he is nothing as a Christian, nor in the
business of salvation; and is the greatest of all the graces of the
Spirit; and is of such a nature, that when prophecies, tongues,
knowledge, and all external gifts shall fail, and even the internal
graces of faith and hope shall cease, the one being changed for vision,
and the other swallowed up in enjoyment, this will continue; and the
rather this grace may be thought to be meant, since the apostle
immediately passes to treat it in the next chapter, and prefers it to
all gifts, and even graces.
