[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 21:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO 2 CHRONICLES 21

This chapter relates Jehoram's succession to the throne of Judah, and
the murders and idolatries committed by him, [Ch2
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#001.md), the revolt of the Edomites from
him, and some of his own people, [Ch2
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#008.md), a writing of Elijah to him,
threatening a great plague to him and his family, [Ch2
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#012.md), the raising up of several
enemies against him, [Ch2 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#016.md), his
sickness, death, and burial, [Ch2
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#018.md).

[2 Chronicles 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 21:1</span></span>

Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers,.... See Gill on [Kg1
22:50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#050.md).

[2 Chronicles 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 21:2</span></span>

And he had brethren, the sons of Jehoshaphat,.... That is, Jehoram had,
who succeeded him: their names follow:

Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and
Shephatiah; two of them were of the same name; though it may be
observed, that in the Hebrew text they are somewhat distinguished, the
latter is called Azariah; Jehiel is said, by the Jews (x), to be the
same with Hiel that rebuilt Jericho; indeed it was rebuilt in the times
of Jehoshaphat, and was a city of the tribe of Benjamin, [Jos
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#021.md) which was under his
jurisdiction; but it can never be thought that he would ever suffer a
son of his to rebuild it; besides, he is expressly said to be a
Bethelite, [Kg1 16:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#034.md),

all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel; which generally,
since the division of the kingdom, designs the ten tribes, but cannot be
the meaning here, because Jehoshaphat was only king of two tribes, Judah
and Benjamin; they were tribes of Israel indeed, and so he was king of a
part of Israel; and besides, many out of the ten tribes came and settled
in his kingdom, and were under his government; though some think he is
so called, because he concerned himself so much for the kingdom of
Israel, and more than for his own; but the Vulgate Latin, Septuagint,
Syriac, and Arabic versions, all read king of Judah; wherefore some are
of opinion that Israel is a mistake of the transcriber; but this need
not be supposed, since he was of right king of Israel, and was in fact
king of two tribes that belonged to Israel.

\(x\) T. Hieros. Sanhedrin, fol. 29. 4.

[2 Chronicles 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 21:3</span></span>

And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of
precious things,.... As jewels and precious stones; or precious
garments, as the Targum, in like manner as Abraham gave to his sons,
when he sent them from Isaac:

with fenced cities in Judah; not as their own property, but he appointed
them governors in them, to defend them against an enemy, and as a mark
of honour to them:

but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram, because he was the firstborn;
strictly observing the law in [Deu
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#016.md), which was not always done;
though it was reckoned by the Heathens contrary to the law of nations to
give the kingdom to the younger (y).

\(y\) Justin. e Trogo, l. 16. c. 2.

[2 Chronicles 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 21:4</span></span>

Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father,....
Succeeded him in it, and reigned alone, for he had reigned with his
father some years before his death; see Gill on [Kg2
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#016.md),

he strengthened himself; in the kingdom, by some means or another
closely attaching the greater part of the princes, and people of the
land, unto him, when he thought himself well settled and established on
the throne; though some understand it of making strong, or hardening his
heart to do what is next mentioned:

and slew all his brethren with the sword; either to get their riches
into his hands, or lest, being religious princes, they should oppose his
restoring idolatry, and for that reason the people should depose him,
and set up one of them; and therefore he dispatched them out of the way
to secure himself, and carry his point:

and divers also of the princes of Israel; such who had removed out of
the ten tribes, for the sake of religion, and therefore would never
agree to the introduction of idolatry among them, for which reason
Jehoram slew them; and perhaps they might express their disapprobation
and abhorrence of his murder of his brethren.

[2 Chronicles 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 21:5</span></span>

Jehoram was thirty two years old,.... Of these verses; see Gill on [Kg2
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#017.md), [Kg2
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#018.md), [Kg2
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#019.md), [Kg2
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#020.md), [Kg2
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#021.md), [Kg2
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#022.md)

[2 Chronicles 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 21:11</span></span>

Moreover, he made high places in the mountains of Judah,.... Temples and
altars for idols, which, being built on mountains, had the name of high
places; and these Jehoram made or rebuilt were those which had been
pulled down by Asa and Jehoshaphat:

and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication; that is,
idolatry, drawing them by his own example to worship Baal, for he did
what Ahab and his family did, [Ch2
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#006.md), and compelled Judah thereto; the
inhabitants of Jerusalem falling into the same idolatrous practice with
him, he forced the inhabitants of the cities, and in the country, to do
the same, who it seems were not so willing and ready to comply
therewith.

[2 Chronicles 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 21:12</span></span>

And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet,.... Not what
was written by him after his ascension to heaven, and from thence came
to Jehoram, even seven years after that, as say some Jewish writers (z);
nor was it a writing from another person of the same name in those
times, since of such an one we nowhere read; nor from Elisha bearing the
name of Elijah, having a double portion of his spirit on him, since he
is never so called; but this was a writing of Elijah's before his
ascension, who, foreseeing by a spirit of prophecy what Jehoram would be
guilty of, wrote this, and gave it to one of the prophets, as Kimchi
suggests, and most probably to Elisha, to communicate it to him at a
proper time; and who might, as the above writer intimates, think it came
immediately from heaven:

saying, thus saith the Lord God of David thy father; and from whose God
he had departed, and to which ancestor of his he was so much unlike:

because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor
in the ways of Asa king of Judah; neither trod in the steps of his
father nor grandfather.

\(z\) Seder Olam Rabba, c. 17. Ganz. Tzemach David, par. 1. fol. 12. 1.
A. M. 3050.

[2 Chronicles 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 21:13</span></span>

And hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel,.... Worshipping the
calves, and even Baal, with other idols, as they did:

and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring,
like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab; meaning spiritual whoredoms
or idolatries:

and hast also slain thy brethren of thy father's house, which were
better than thyself; more religious, more humane, more prudent, and
fitter for government.

[2 Chronicles 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 21:14</span></span>

Behold, with a great plague will the Lord smite thy people,.... They
going into the same idolatry with himself willingly, at least great part
of them, and therefore deserved to be smitten, and which would be a
punishment to him:

and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods; which should be
carried captive, as the event shows.

[2 Chronicles 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 21:15</span></span>

And thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels,.... Which
was a just retaliation to him, for having no bowels of compassion on his
brethren whom he slew:

until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day; that
continuing day after day, and even year after year, the space of two
years, as appears from [Ch2 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#019.md).

[2 Chronicles 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 21:16</span></span>

Moreover, the Lord stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the
Philistines,.... Which had been depressed in the times of Jehoshaphat,
to whom they brought their presents and tribute willingly, [Ch2
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#011.md).

and of the Arabians that were near the Ethiopians; not the Ethiopians of
Africa, as the Targum, for the Arabians were not near them, but the
Chusaean Arabs or Midianites, see [Num
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#001.md). The Targum is, the Word of the
Lord did this.

[2 Chronicles 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 21:17</span></span>

And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, &c. l In an hostile
manner:

and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house,
his gold, silver, and precious things, the rich furniture of his palace;
no mention is made of any other plunder in the city, or the country; so
that they seem to have had their principal eye to the king's palace, and
the spoil of that; being so directed by the providence of God, who had
stirred them up to do this as a punishment of Jehoram:

and his sons also, and his wives; these they also carried away, all but
Athaliah, who hid herself; he through his disease not being able to make
any opposition, or to get any forces together to withstand them:

so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of
his sons; the same that is called Ahaziah and Azariah, [Ch2
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#001.md) so the prophecy in [Ch2
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#014.md) was fulfilled.

[2 Chronicles 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 21:18</span></span>

After all this the Lord smote him in his bowels with an incurable
disease. What it was is not agreed upon; some take it be an "hernia", or
rupture; others, the falling of the "anus", or a fistula in it; others,
the colic, or iliac passion; but generally it is thought to be a
dysentery, or bloody flux; the Targum is,"the Word of the Lord broke
him.''

[2 Chronicles 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch2 21:19</span></span>

And it came to pass that in process of time, after the end of two
years,.... So long he was afflicted and tortured with the above disease:

his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness; either in like manner as
Judas's did, [Act 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#018.md) or as in the
manner the bowels of Arius are said to do, while sitting on the seat of
the vault (a); or perhaps only what was contained in the bowels is
meant, if it was the colic:

so he died of sore diseases; he seems to have had a complication of
them, and these very painful and distressing:

and the people made no burning for him, like the burnings of his
fathers; as they did for his grandfather Asa, [Ch2
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#014.md), they did not burn spices or
odoriferous wood, as the Targum; though his body, because of the stench
of it, needed it, as Jarchi observes.

\(a\) Sozomen. Eccl. Hist. l. 2. c. 29, 30.

[2 Chronicles 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 21:20</span></span>

Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned
in Jerusalem eight years,.... See [Kg2
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#017.md),

and departed without being desired; to live, either by himself, being
weary of life through the pain he endured; or by his people, he being so
wicked a prince, and so ill beloved by them, that nobody wished to have
him live, but were glad to hear of his death; the meaning is, he died
unlamented; his death is expressed by a departing out of this world into
another, a phrase more than once used for death in the New Testament,
see [Joh 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#001.md),

howbeit, they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres
of the kings; they showed him some respect for the sake of his father,
by burying him in the city of David, but denied him the honour of lying
in the royal sepulchres, see [Kg2
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#024.md).
