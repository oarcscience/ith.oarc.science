INTRODUCTION TO SECOND SAMUEL 17

This chapter relates the advice Ahithophel gave to march out speedily
with a number of men in pursuit of David, which at first seemed
agreeable, [Sa2 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#001.md); but Hushai's
opinion being asked, and he giving counsel to raise a larger army, which
required time, and was taken to, hereby the counsel of Ahithophel was
defeated, [Sa2 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#005.md); upon which he
hanged himself, [Sa2 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#023.md); these
different counsels being communicated by Hushai to the priests, they
found means to transmit them to David, with an instruction to him to
pass over Jordan immediately; which he did, and pitched in Gilead, and
whither he was followed by Absalom, [Sa2
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#015.md); and where he met with a supply
of provisions for his army from some eminent persons in and near that
place, [Sa2 17:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#027.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 17:1</span></span>

Moreover, Ahithophel said unto Absalom,.... Either at the same time, or
quickly after he had given the foregoing advice:

let me now choose out twelve thousand men: out of those that were with
Absalom, which shows their number to be large; and twelve thousand are
pitched upon with respect to the twelve tribes of Israel, a thousand
from every tribe; Josephus has only ten thousand:

and I will arise and pursue after David this night; he took upon him to
be general of the army, as well as a counsellor; or this he said to show
how confident he was of the success of his counsel, that if Absalom, or
any other, should decline the conduct of the army upon it, as a
hazardous attempt, he would undertake it himself; or rather it may be,
he was not willing that Absalom should go out in person with the army,
not so much for his own safety, as lest through his affection for the
king he should spare him, when he fell into his hands, or they two
should be reconciled; he proposed to do it that night, partly for
expedition, no time being to be lost, and partly for the greater
surprise of David and his men.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 17:2</span></span>

And I will come upon him while he is weary,.... With travelling, and
with grief, and when endeavouring to get some rest by sleep, and so
surprise him unawares, when not on his guard, and in no posture of
defence:

and weak handed; while the number of men with him is small, and before
the people from different parts can come to his assistance:

and will make him afraid; strike terror into him and his then, by
surprising them suddenly in the night with such a number of men:

and all the people that are with him shall flee; one one way, and
another another, for their own security, and leave David alone:

and I will smite the king only; dispatch him, and let the people flee
without pursuing them.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 17:3</span></span>

And I will bring back all the people unto thee,.... Meaning not the
people only that were with David, that he would make them prisoners, and
bring them with him; for he before proposed to let them make their
escape; but to reduce all Israel to the obedience of Absalom at once, by
executing this scheme which he had formed:

the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned; meaning David, whom he
speaks of contemptibly, and whose life it seems Absalom sought, as well
as his crown; and he being dead, it would be all over at once with the
people; they would immediately return to their own habitations, and
yield obedience to Absalom as the rightful heir and successor; all
depended on his death, he intimates: from whence it appears that
Abarbinel is wrong in suggesting that Absalom did not design to take
away the life of his father, only to secure the kingdom to himself in
his father's lifetime, who he understood had disposed of it by his will
to Solomon; but here Ahithophel plainly declares the intention of
Absalom, nor would he have proposed in plain terms to take away the
king's life, had Absalom been averse to it; and it is plain by what
follows that the thing was pleasing to him:

so all the people shall be in peace; both parties coalesce under the
government of Absalom, and live peaceably under it, and so an entire end
of the war.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa2 17:4</span></span>

And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all elders of Israel. That were
of the privy council; for it was a well contrived scheme to surprise
David his men by night, in the condition they were in; nothing like
seizing an opportunity, and making quick dispatch in executing a
villainous design; only it is strange that Absalom could so easily come
into a scheme to take away the life of so indulgent a father, which is
only to be accounted for by his ambition; but it is stranger still that
the elders of Israel should be pleased with it, and agree to and
determine upon the death of a prince, who had so many years ruled them
with justice and equity, clemency and mercy; and fought their battles
for them, and raised their nation to such a pitch of glory it never had
before.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa2 17:5</span></span>

Then said Absalom, call now Hushai the Archite also,.... For it seems he
was not at the council board at this time; whether he was as yet
admitted to it is not certain: there is something very remarkable in the
providence of God, to incline Absalom to have the opinion of Hushai upon
this point, when the counsel of Ahithophel was so universally approved
of; and Hushai also being well known to have been an intimate friend and
confident of David's, and not so settled and established in the interest
of Absalom, and such a sworn friend of his as Ahithophel was; this can
only be ascribed to the will of God, to defeat the counsel of
Ahithophel, and the wisdom of divine Providence in blinding the mind of
Absalom with respect to his counsel, and inclining it to take the
opinion of Hushai:

and let us hear likewise what he saith; which he might say without any
diffidence about the "counsel" given, but knowing that in the multitude
of counsellors there is safety; and Hushai being a wise and good
counsellor, he might hope and expect that he would give the same advice,
and so strengthen and confirm it.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 17:6</span></span>

And when Hushai was come to Absalom,.... Into the council chamber, very
probably:

Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this
manner; and then related the counsel he had given as before:

shall we do after his saying? is it right to proceed on this scheme, and
carry it into execution?

if not, speak thou; thy mind freely, without any reserve, or fear of
giving any offence.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa2 17:7</span></span>

And Hushai said to Absalom,.... Having leave to give his opinion freely:

the counsel that Ahithophel hath given is not good at this time; he owns
that Ahithophel was a good counsellor, and that the counsel he gave was
for the most part, if not always, good, but what he gave at this time
was not so; the wisest of men may sometimes be mistaken. Abarbinel
thinks he respects his former counsel, particularly that that was good,
advising him to defile his father's bed, [Sa2
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#021.md); but this was not, for which he
gives the following reasons.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 17:8</span></span>

For (said Hushai) thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be
mighty men,.... Men of courage and valour, and not such weak-handed and
weak-hearted men, and so easily intimidated, as Ahithophel suggests:

and they be chafed in their minds; or "bitter in soul" (f); not merely
filled with trouble and anguish, and depressed in their spirits, on
account of that, as the phrase sometimes signifies; but enraged and full
of wrath at the rebellion raised against their prince, which obliged
them with him to leave their habitations; and now being desperate, their
all lying at stake, their wives and children, their families and
estates, they would fight furiously in the defence of the king and
themselves, and not so soon flee as Ahithophel had represented:

as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field; a bear is a very furious
creature, especially a she bear, and the more when it has whelps, and
more so when deprived of them (g), when it ranges about in the field,
and in its fury attacks whomsoever it meets with; See Gill on [Hos
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#008.md),

and thy father is a man of war; not only bold and courageous, but expert
and skilful in all the arts of war and not easy to be surprised and
circumvented, as Ahithophel intimated:

and will not lodge with the people; in the camp, but at some distance
from it; partly to prevent any traitorous design upon him in it, and
partly that he might not be surprised by the enemy, knowing that their
chief view was to seize his person; and therefore as it would not be
easy to find him where he was, he could not be smitten alone, as
Ahithophel proposed.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 17:9</span></span>

Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place,.... Some
lurking place, as he was acquainted with many when he fled from Saul,
and where he preserved himself from him; so that he could never take
him, as he would now from Absalom, as he insinuates: but this is not
all; not only by this means he would shelter himself, and be in safety;
but lying thus concealed with others, and in ambush, there would be
danger of his staring out of his hiding place when opportunity should
offer, and falling on some of Absalom's troops unawares:

and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first;
that is, some of Absalom's party, on whom David and his men coming out
of an ambush should fall, and make a slaughter among them first, before
they could do anything of consequence; and so having got the first
advantage, it would serve to animate them, and dishearten their enemies:

that whosoever heareth it; at that time, or the next day:

will say, there is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom;
there has been a defeat of them, and that may cause a defection.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa2 17:10</span></span>

And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion,
shall utterly melt,.... That is, whoever should hear of Absalom's
forces, or a part of them, being routed, would be intimidated, though
ever so courageous, or of such a lion-like temper and disposition; and
even Ahithophel himself, notwithstanding all his boasted courage, his
heart would fail, he would melt like water (h), [Jos
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#005.md); should he meet with such a rebuff
at first setting out. A lion is well known for its courage as well as
strength, and has not only a fierce countenance, hence we read of
lion-like men in their faces, [Sa2
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#020.md); but has a courageous heart, and
from thence it is thought to have its name Labi, from "leb", which
signifies the heart; so Hercules is represented by the poet as having a
lion's heart (i), and others also; though Leo Africanus (k) relates of
some lions in Africa that are so naturally fearful that they will flee
at the cry of children, particularly at a place called Agla; hence it
became a proverb with the inhabitants of Fez to call blustering cowards
the lions of Agla; and he speaks of great numbers of lions elsewhere
(l), who are easily driven away with a small stick by the most timorous
persons; but for the most part lions are very bold and daring, as well
as strong, to which the allusion is here. Some apply this to David
himself, who was a valiant man, and whose heart was like that of a lion,
and so read the last clause with an interrogation: "shall he utterly
melt?" no, he will not; he is not to be made afraid so easily as
Ahithophel has intimated:

for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they which
be with him are valiant men: this is so universally known that it cannot
be denied.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 17:11</span></span>

Therefore I counsel,.... My advice is as follows:

that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee, from Dan even to
Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude: not all the
inhabitants of the land, but such as are fit to bear arms, or that were
soldiers, employed in military affairs, in keeping garrisons, guarding
the coasts, &c. even the militia of the nation, from the extreme
boundary of it on the north to the extreme boundary of it on the south;
in such a direction lay Dan and Beersheba. This is opposed to the
counsel of Ahithophel, which was only to select twelve thousand men, and
send them against David at once; and this is designed chiefly to gain
time, since such a collection could not be made soon, and so David would
have more time to get farther off, and to prepare the better for his
defence; and this advice might be the more agreeable to Absalom, as it
promised a greater certainty of success through numbers, and might feed
the vanity and ambition of that prince to have such a large army under
him, as well as suggested that all Israel were on his side, and at his
command, and might easily be gathered to him:

and that thou go to battle in thine own person; this was another part of
his advice opposed to the counsel of Ahithophel, who proposed to have
the command of the twelve thousand men himself, and to leave Absalom at
Jerusalem; now Hushai suggests that it would be more to his interest and
his honour to take command of the army himself, and go in person into
the field of battle; since this would serve to animate his soldiers,
when they saw their prince at the head of them, and he would have the
glory of the victory, which he might insinuate hereby Ahithophel sought
to deprive him of: it is in the Hebrew text, that "thy face" or "faces
go to battle" (m), where he might be seen in person, and have the
oversight and direction of things himself; the Targum is,"and thou shalt
go at the head of us all;''and this advice Hushai was directed to give,
and which was taken, that Absalom might fall in battle.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 17:12</span></span>

So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found,.... For
such a numerous army, which would be spread abroad, could not well fail
of finding him out, let him be in what lurking place he would; whereas
he might lie concealed, and escape so small a number as twelve thousand
men:

and we will light upon him as the dew falleth upon the ground; whose
drops are innumerable, and cover all the ground where they fall; and the
phrase not only expresses their numbers, but the irresistible force they
should come with, and the manner, secretly, unawares, opportunely; the
Romans had a sort of soldiers, called from the dew "rorarii", who
carried light armour, and fought first in the battle, from whence they
had their name, because dew falls before it rains (n):

and of him, and of all the men that are with him, there shall not be
left so much as one; so that for the future Absalom would sit easy upon
the throne, there being none left to molest him.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 17:13</span></span>

Moreover, if he be gotten into a city,.... A strong fortified place,
thinking to secure himself there, where he might hold out against those
that were risen against him; the former part of the account supposes him
in the field, where he would soon be detected, if hidden in a pit or any
other place, or if he appeared openly would quickly be overthrown by the
numerous forces of Absalom; and here it suggests, should he betake
himself to a city for shelter:

then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city; scaling ropes, and
thereby get upon and over the walls of it, and take it by storm; or
engines worked with ropes, used for the demolishing of cities; so
Tacitus speaks of "vincula tormentorum", the bands or ropes of engines,
as Grotius observes; the Targum renders it by "armies", thus,"all Israel
shall be gathered against the city, and surround it with
armies,''besiege it in form, and so surround it that David could not
possibly make his escape out of it, nor could it hold out long against
such numerous forces; or this is an hyperbolical expression, as Kimchi
calls it, signifying that their numbers would be so many, that they
could soon and easily demolish it:

and we will draw it into the river; by the side of which it was built,
or the ditch or trench around it, or the valley near it, that being
built on an hill; and by this boasting, bragging, hyperbolical
expression, he signifies that they should be able easily and utterly to
destroy its walls, buildings, and towers, as if a number of men were to
fasten a rope about anything, and by their main strength, and through
their numbers, draw it down whither they pleased:

until there be not one small stone found there; and this being the case,
David and his men must inevitably fall into their hands, and none
escape.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 17:14</span></span>

And Absalom and all the men of Israel said,.... That is, the elders, who
before approved of the counsel of Ahithophel, [Sa2
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#004.md),

the counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of
Ahithophel; it appeared to them most plausible, and most likely to be
attended with success:

for the Lord had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel; for
so it was to Absalom and his party the best and wisest that could be
given them; but it was the Lord's will it should be defeated, and
therefore the minds of Absalom and of the elders of Israel were blinded:

to the intent that the Lord might bring evil upon Absalom; his person
and cause; that his cause might be ruined, and he himself slain in
battle; see [Pro 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#021.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa2 17:15</span></span>

Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests,.... After he
was returned from the council board, he immediately went to these
priests, who he knew were in the interest of David, and to whom he was
to communicate, and by them transmit, what passed at Jerusalem, [Sa2
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#035.md),

thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel;
relating to them in express words what he advised to:

and thus and thus have I counselled; telling them in what manner he had
given his counsel.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 17:16</span></span>

Now therefore send quickly and tell David,.... What has been advised to
on both sides:

saying, lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness; which
reached to Jericho; this advice he gave, because he knew not whether his
counsel would be abode by, though preferred; Absalom and the elders of
Israel might change their minds, and Ahithophel might, by the strength
of his oratory, prevail upon them after all to follow his advice; and
therefore, to guard against the worst, he judged it most prudential in
David to make all the haste he could from that place where he was, and
not continue a night longer in it; for, if Ahithophel's counsel should
take place, he would be in pursuit of him that very night:

but speedily pass over; the river Jordan:

lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him: be
destroyed by the forces Ahithophel should bring with him, which he would
not be able to withstand.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 17:17</span></span>

Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel,.... Who were the sons of the
priests; these did not go into the city of Jerusalem with their parents,
when they were sent back by David, [Sa2
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#027.md); but stayed by their direction
at this place, which was near Jerusalem, and is called in the Targum the
fuller's fountain, where they washed their clothes; and, as Kimchi and
Jarchi say, by treading them with their feet, whence it had the name of
Rogel, of which See Gill on [Jos 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#007.md),

(for they might not be seen to come into the city); having been charged
by their parents to continue there for the sake of carrying intelligence
to David, or because suspected by Absalom's party of carrying on such an
intrigue:

and a wench went and told them: what Hushai had communicated to the
priests, and what was his advice to David; this girl is supposed by
Kimchi and Abarbinel to be of the family of Zadok, by whom she was
sufficiently instructed to tell her message, and of whom there would be
no suspicion:

and they went and told King David; the sons of the priests went and
related to him all that had been transmitted to them.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 17:18</span></span>

Nevertheless, a lad saw them, and told Absalom,.... Saw them conversing
with the girl, and departing for David's army; according to Josephus
(o), they were some horsemen that saw them about two furlongs or a
quarter mile from Jerusalem, and acquainted Absalom with it:

but they went both of them away quickly; made all the haste they could
with their message to David:

and came to a man's house in Bahurim; where very probably they had been
informed David had been, whither he came weary, and had refreshment,
[Sa2 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#014.md); or rather, perceiving they
were discovered and pursued, they turned in hither, the first place they
came to, for safety:

which had a well in his court; which they observed, and was the reason
of their turning in:

whither they went down; to hide themselves from their pursuers, it being
dry, as sometimes wells were in the summertime: Josephus says (p), a
woman let them down by a rope.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa2 17:19</span></span>

And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth,.... This
woman, very probably, was the man's wife of the house, as Abarbinel
notes; who took a cloth, and spread it over the well's mouth, that it
could not be seen or known that there was a well there:

and spread ground corn thereon: just taken out of the mill, before it
was sifted, while in the bran; or corn unhusked, or just threshed out,
in order to be dried in the sun, and then parched; or wheat bruised for
that purpose: Josephus says (q) they were locks of wool she spread:

and the thing was not known; that the young men were in the well.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa2 17:20</span></span>

And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house,.... Who were
sent after then, had intelligence which way they took, and into what
house they turned:

they said, where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? calling them by their names,
being persons well known, and as to them, so to the woman of the house,
as they supposed:

and the woman said unto them, they be gone over the brook of water; the
river Jordan; so the Targum,"they have already passed over Jordan;''

this was a lie she told them, which is not to be justified; the Vulgate
Latin version,"they passed over hastily, having drank a little
water;''and so Josephus (r) in some copies:

and when they had sought and could not find them; not only searched that
house, but very probably others in Bahurim:

they returned to Jerusalem; to give an account what success they had.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa2 17:21</span></span>

And it came to pass after they were departed,.... The servants of
Absalom:

that they came up out of the well; the sons of the priests, being
informed by the woman that they were gone; Josephus (s) says they were
drawn up by the woman with a rope:

and went and told King David; who was now in the plain of the
wilderness, perhaps near Jericho, and not a great way from Jordan, to
whom they related the whole of their message:

and said unto David; as they were directed:

arise, and pass quickly over the water; the river Jordan:

for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you; to come with twelve
thousand men, and fall upon him that very night; and it was not certain
his counsel would be rejected; and therefore it was advisable for David
to prepare against the worst.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa2 17:22</span></span>

Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and passed over
Jordan,.... Taking the advice of Hushai:

by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over
Jordan; they travelled all night, and before it was morning they had all
passed the river in boats, or through the fords, and not one was lost in
the passage, nor any deserted, see [Joh
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#012.md); and now perhaps David penned
the forty second and forty third psalms, [Psa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa2 17:23</span></span>

And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed,.... But that
of Hushai:

he saddled his ass; or ordered it to be saddled:

and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city; which was Giloh
in the tribe of Judah, [Sa2 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#012.md),

and put his household in order; made his will, and disposed of his
estates, see [Isa 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#001.md); or "commanded
his house" or "household" (t); gave orders and instructions, both
relating to himself when dead, where and how he should be buried, and to
his family, how they should behave to one another and among their
neighbours, and towards their superiors; and particularly, the Jews say
(u), he gave them this charge, not to rebel against the government of
the house of David:

and hanged himself; so to his other sins added that of suicide, which
was done deliberately, as the preceding clause shows; this he did,
partly because his proud spirit could not bear it that his counsel
should be slighted, and that of another be preferred to it; and partly
because he plainly foresaw that the cause of Absalom would be ruined by
neglecting his counsel and following that of Hushai's, whereby he
himself would fall into the hands of David, and be put to death by him
as a traitor; and he chose to die by his own hand, and not his; and the
rather, to prevent the confiscation of his goods and estates as a
traitor, and his heirs being deprived of them; though some think he died
of a disease, by strangling or suffocation in the throat, was choked
through grief and trouble; so R. Elias observes (w), that some say that
this disease came upon him through the greatness of his grief of mind
and trouble of soul, because his counsel was not taken, and he died of
strangling; and they say this, because they reckon it an absurdity for
so wise and understanding a man as he was to hang himself; but the case
seems very clear that he did kill himself; the Jews say (x) he was but
thirty three years of age when he died; for being a bloody and deceitful
man, he did not live out half his days, [Psa
55:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#023.md); which psalm was penned on his
account; but one so young could hardly be a counsellor of David, and so
famous for his wise counsel; and besides, if so young, could not be the
grandfather of Bathsheba, as the Jews say:

and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father; though he died
an ignominious death, he had an honourable burial; it perhaps not being
usual in those times to put any mark of infamy on those that killed
themselves, by refusing them interment in the common burying places of
their friends and neighbours.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa2 17:24</span></span>

Then David came to Mahanaim,.... A city on the other side Jordan in the
tribe of Gad, [Jos 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#026.md), famous for
its being the place where the angels of God met Jacob, [Gen
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#001.md); and was for some time the seat
of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, [Sa2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#008.md);

and Absalom passed over Jordan, he, and all the men of Israel with him;
not directly after David, but some time after, when, according to the
counsel of Hushai, he had gathered all the warlike men of Israel to him
that he could, and with this army pursued his father; not content to
drive him to the other side Jordan, sought to seize his person, and take
away his life, and so secure the crown and kingdom to him, of which he
made no doubt, having such a numerous army, on which he relied.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa2 17:25</span></span>

And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab,.... Who was
along with David:

which Amasa was a man's son whose name was Ithra, an Israelite; he is
called Jether the Ishmaelite, [Ch1
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#017.md); either because he was an
Ishmaelite by birth, and being proselyted to the Jewish religion, was
called an Israelite; or rather he was an Israelite by birth, and having
sojourned in the land of Ishmael some time, was called an Ishmaelite, as
Uriah the Hittite, and others; and when Amasa is called a "man's son",
it means a great man, as Kimchi observes:

that went in to Abigail, the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah,

Joab's mother: so that Joab and Amasa, the generals of David and
Absalom, were own cousins, sisters' children, and David uncle to them
both; for Abigail and Zeruiah were David's sisters, [Ch1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#016.md); children of Jesse, whose name is
here called Nahash, having two names, or this was his surname; though
others think Nahash is the name of a woman, the wife of Jesse, and that
these two sisters had two mothers, but one father; it seems by this
expression, "went in to", as if Amasa was not begotten in the conjugal
state, but was illegitimate.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa2 17:26</span></span>

So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead. Which belonged to
the tribes of Reuben and Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh; here the
Israelites that were with Absalom encamped, in order to give battle to
David and his men.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa2 17:27</span></span>

And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim,.... When he first
came thither, [Sa2 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#024.md),

that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon: who was
either the son, or rather the brother of Hanun king of the Ammonites,
that used David's ambassadors in so shameful a manner, whom David
overcame and deposed, and set up this brother in his room; who had
showed his dislike of his brother's conduct, and now makes a grateful
return to David for his favours; though some say this was Hanun himself,
as Jarchi, now become a proselyte, which is not so likely; others take
this man to be an Israelite that continued in Rabbah, the metropolis of
the Ammonites, after it was taken by David:

and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar; the same that brought up
Mephibosheth, from whom David received him and took him off of his
hands, for which now he requited him, see [Sa2
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#005.md),

and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim; a place that lay under the hills
of Gilead (y); it had its name from the "fullers" who dwelt here for the
convenience of fountains of water to wash their clothes in.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">sa2 17:28</span></span>

Brought beds,.... For David and his men, who, fleeing from Jerusalem in
haste, could bring none with them, and therefore were ill provided while
in the plains of the wilderness; the Septuagint version says there were
ten of them, and that they were of tapestry, wrought on both sides, and
such the ancients used (z), see [Pro
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#016.md); and so ten basins in the next
clause:

and basins, and earthen vessels; to put their food and liquors in, and
eat and drink out of, and for other services:

and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched corn; or "kali", which was
made of the above corn ground into meal, and mixed with water or milk,
and eaten with honey or oil, as there was another sort made of pulse,
later mentioned:

and beans, and lentiles, and parched pulse; or "kali", made of these in
the above manner. Some think (a) coffee is meant, but without reason.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">sa2 17:29</span></span>

And honey and butter,.... Honey was much in use with the ancients; Homer
(b) speaks of it as a part of the provisions at a feast, and as food
with which persons were nourished and brought up; and the ancient
Scythians lived on milk and honey (c); and this and butter were pretty
much the food of the people in Judea; see [Isa
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#015.md),

and sheep; with which and goats the land of Gilead abounded; see [Sol
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#001.md),

and cheese of kine: made of the milk of cows, as it commonly is:

for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat; and no doubt
they brought wine with them for them to drink; the men that brought
these, some brought one sort, and some another, or however different
parcels of the same, and did not join in one present; for they came from
different parts:

for they said, the people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the
wilderness; where they had been some time, and out of which they had
just come, and so weary with travelling, and therefore brought beds to
lie down and rest upon; and being hungry and thirsty, through want of
bread and water in the wilderness, they brought them both eatables and
drinkables; for though the latter is not expressed, it is to be
understood, as the word "thirsty" supposes.
