### [Esther Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/est010.htm#001.md)

[Esther](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#001.md)

INTRODUCTION TO ESTHER 10

This chapter is very short, and just makes mention of a tribute
Ahasuerus laid on his realm, [Est
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/est010.htm#001.md), refers to the Persian
chronicles, both for the greatness of him, and of Mordecai, and is
closed with the character of the latter, [Est
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/est010.htm#002.md).

[Esther 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/est010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">est 10:1</span></span>

And the King Ahasuerus laid a tribute on the land, and upon the isles of
the sea. Which include all his dominions, both on the continent, and on
the sea, the Aegean sea; though Aben Ezra thinks it regards such as were
not under his government, but stood in fear of him, of whom he demanded
tribute. If Ahasuerus was Xerxes, perhaps his exchequer might be drained
by his wars with the Grecians, which put him upon this; though some
understand this of his renewing the taxes and tribute, which he remitted
upon his marriage with Esther, [Est
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#018.md).

[Esther 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/est010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">est 10:2</span></span>

And all the acts of his power, and of his might,.... As Xerxes was a
very mighty and powerful prince:

and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king
advanced him; the history of that, and which tended not a little to the
greatness, dignity and prosperity of the king himself, and his whole
kingdom:

are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media
and Persia? to which the reader is referred by the writer of this book,
the which were in being in his times, but now lost: had they been
preserved, they might have been of great use to lead into the history of
the Medes and Persians, which for want of them is very dark and
intricate; the writer of this book having nothing further to do with it,
than as it related to the affairs of the Jews.

[Esther 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/est010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">est 10:3</span></span>

For Mordecai the Jew was next unto Ahasuerus,.... The second man in the
kingdom, the principal of the counsellors, and prime minister of state:

and great among the Jews; highly respected by them, in great honour and
esteem with them, for which there was great reason:

and accepted of the multitude of his brethren; or of many, of most, of
the greatest part of them; for, let a man be ever so deserving, there
are some that will envy his greatness, cavil at everything done by him,
and speak evil of him without any just reason:

seeking the wealth of his people; their good, their welfare and
happiness, temporal and spiritual:

and speaking peace to all his seed; not only to his family, but to all
the Jews who were of the same seed with him, the seed of Abraham; either
speaking to them in an humble and condescending manner, being very
humane, affable, and courteous; or speaking for them to the king, asking
of him for them what might conduce to their peace, prosperity, and
happiness. No mention is made in this history of the death and burial
either of Mordecai or Esther; but the author of Cippi Hebraici says (z),
that Mordecai was buried in the city of Shushan, and that all the Jews
in those parts assemble at his grave on the day of Purim, and sing
songs, playing on tabrets and pipes, rejoicing that there was a miracle
wrought; and the same writer says (a), they do the like at that time at
the grave of Esther, half a mile from Tzephat, read this book that bears
her name, eat, drink, and rejoice. Benjamin of Tudela says (b), they
were both buried before a synagogue, at a place called Hamdan.
