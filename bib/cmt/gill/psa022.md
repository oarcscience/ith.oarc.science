INTRODUCTION TO PSALM 22

To the chief Musician upon Aijeleth Shahar, a Psalm of David. The only
thing observable in the title of this psalm is the sense of the words
"Aijeleth Shahar", left untranslated; which, according to some of the
Jewish (g) interpreters, is the name of a musical instrument; to which
our version inclines; and a learned Jew (h) says, it is the instrument
which the mourning women used on account of distress which was sudden,
not known till it came, as a man does not think of the morning till he
sees it. "Aijeleth" with him has the signification of mourning, as "Eli"
in [Joe 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#008.md); and "Shahar", as in [Isa
47:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#011.md); so and are used in the Misnah
(i) for a mourning woman; and with others it is the beginning of a song
to the tune of which the psalm was set (k) but I rather think the words
express the subject matter of the psalm, and that they may be rendered,
concerning "Aijeleth Shahar"; which signify, either according to the
Chaldee paraphrase, "the daily morning sacrifice"; or, as some Jewish
writers (l) observe, the "morning star"; or, according to the
Septuagint, "the morning help" (m); or rather "the morning hind"; or
"hind of the morning": but who should be designed hereby is the
question. The Jews would have any rather than the Messiah; some say
Esther (n), who so seasonably and readily appeared for the Jews in
distress, and was the means of their deliverance; but there is not one
word in the psalm that agrees with her; and there are some things which
were manifestly spoken of a man, and not a woman, [Psa
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#008); others say David (o.md), when he
fled from Saul, or, as others, from Absalom: but the disjointing the
bones of this person, the piercing his hands and feet, parting his
garments, and casting lots on his vesture, mentioned in [Psa
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#014.md); were never fulfilled in him.
Others (p) would have the congregation of Israel in captivity intended;
but it is plain that a single person is spoken of throughout; and he is
manifestly distinguished from others, from his brethren, from the
congregation, from the seed of Jacob and Israel, [Psa
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#022.md); and, indeed, no other than the
Messiah can be meant: and of this there ought to be no doubt with
Christians, when [Psa 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001.md) is compared
with [Mat 27:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#046.md); [Psa
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#008.md) with [Mat
27:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#043.md); [Psa
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#018.md) with [Mat
27:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#035.md); [Psa
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#022.md) with [Heb
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#012.md); and the Jews themselves
sometimes say, that by "Aijeleth Shahar" is meant the Shechinah (q), or
the divine Majesty; and in what way soever these words are rendered,
they agree with Christ: he is the antitype of "the daily morning
sacrifice", the Lamb of God, who continually takes away the sin of the
world; and very fitly is he so called in the title of a psalm which
speaks so much of his sufferings and death, which are a propitiatory
sacrifice for the sins of his people; he is "the bright and morning
star", [Rev 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#016.md); the dayspring from
on high, the sun of righteousness, and light of the world: he had
"morning help" in his very infancy, when his life was sought for by
Herod; and had early and seasonable help and assistance in the
acceptable time, and in the day of salvation, and early in the morning
was he raised from the dead, and had glory given him: but as the words
are better rendered "the morning hind", this suits with Christ, who is
frequently compared to a roe or a young hart, [Sol
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#009.md); and he may be compared to a
"hind" for its lovingness to its mate and young, [Pro
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#019.md); the love of Christ to his church
and people being very strong and affectionate, and passing knowledge;
and also for its loveliness and goodliness, [Gen
49:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#021.md); Christ being exceeding amiable
and lovely, and fairer than the children of men; likewise for its
gentleness and harmlessness, Christ being meek and lowly, holy and
harmless; and for its antipathy to serpents, there being an enmity
between Christ, the seed of the woman, and the serpent and his seed; for
its being hunted by dogs, as Christ was by Herod, by the Scribes and
Pharisees, by Judas, and the band of soldiers; see [Psa
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#016.md); for its being fit for food,
[Deu 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#005.md); and as it is said to be the
fitter for being hunted, Christ's flesh being meat indeed, and the more
suitable to faith, as being sacrificed for us; and for its long life it
is said to have, Christ, though once dead, being alive again, and living
for evermore; to which may be added its great swiftness, expressive of
the readiness of Christ to comply with his Father's proposals and do his
will; to come into this world in the fulness of time, and set about the
work he came to do; to deliver up himself into the hands of his enemies,
and lay down his life for his people; and of his haste to help them in
distress, and visit them with his gracious presence, and to appear a
second time to them unto salvation. He may be called the hind of "the
morning", looking lovely and beautiful as the morning, and swift and
cheerful as the hind when it rises from its rest, and runs its course;
or because of his being hunted in the morning of his infancy by Herod;
or because it was early in the morning the chief priests consulted to
take away his life; and as early also he rose from the dead, when God
made his feet like hinds feet, and set him on his high places, [Psa
18:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#033.md). The ancient Christian writers
generally understood it of Christ wholly. Justin Martyr (r) says, the
whole psalm is spoken of Christ; and Tertullian observes (s), that it
contains the whole passion, or all the sufferings of Christ. The late
Mons. Fourmont (t), the elder, professor of the Oriental languages in
the university of Paris, has a very singular notion, that this psalm was
written by Jeremiah, when he was drawn up from the dungeon, and is a
history of his life and sufferings, in which he was a type of Christ.

[Psalms 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 22:1</span></span>

My God, my God,.... God is the God of Christ as he is man; he prepared a
body for him, an human nature; anointed it with the oil of gladness;
supported it under all its sorrows and sufferings, and at last exalted
it at his own right hand:, and Christ behaved towards him as his
covenant God; prayed to him, believed in him, loved him, and was
obedient to him as such; and here expresses his faith of interest in
him, when he hid his face from him, on account of which he expostulates
with him thus, "why hast thou forsaken me?" which is to be understood,
not as if the hypostatical or personal union of the divine and human
natures were dissolved, or that the one was now separated from the
other: for the fulness of the Godhead still dwelt bodily in him; nor
that he ceased to be the object of the Father's love; for so he was in
the midst of all his sufferings, yea, his Father loved him because he
laid down his life for the sheep; nor that the principle of joy and
comfort was lost in him, only the act and sense of it; he was now
deprived of the gracious presence of God, of the manifestations of his
love to his human soul, and had a sense of divine wrath, not for his own
sins, but for the sins of his people, and was for a while destitute of
help and comfort; all which were necessary in order to make satisfaction
for sin: for as he had the sins of his people imputed to him, he must
bear the whole punishment of them, which is twofold the punishment of
loss and the punishment of sense; the former lies in a deprivation of
the divine presence, and the latter in a sense of divine wrath, and both
Christ sustained as the surety of his people. This expostulation is made
not as ignorant of the reason of it; he knew that as he was wounded and
bruised for the sins of his people, he was deserted on the same account;
nor as impatient, for he was a mirror of patience in all his sufferings;
and much less as in despair; for, in these very words, he strongly
expresses and repeats his faith of interest in God; see [Psa
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#008.md); and also [Isa
50:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#006.md). But this is done to set forth
the greatness and bitterness of his sufferings; that not only men hid
their faces from him, and the sun in the firmament withdrew its light
and heat from him, but, what was most grievous of all, his God departed
from him. From hence it appears that he was truly man, had an human
soul, and endured sorrows and sufferings in it; and this may be of use
to his members, to expect the hidings of God's face, though on another
account; and to teach them to wait patiently for him, and to trust in
the Lord, and stay themselves upon their God, even while they walk in
darkness and see no light;

why art thou so far from helping me? or from my salvation; from saving
and delivering him out of his sorrows and sufferings? not that he
despaired of help; he firmly believed he should have it, and accordingly
had it: but he expostulates about the deferring of it. He adds,

and from the words of my roaring? which expresses the vehemency of his
spirit in crying to God, the exceeding greatness of his sorrows, and his
excruciating pains and sufferings: this is what the apostle means by his
"strong crying and tears", [Heb 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007.md);
or "the words of my roaring are far from my salvation"; there is a great
space or interval between the one and the other, as Gussetius (u)
observes.

[Psalms 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 22:2</span></span>

O my God, I cry in the daytime,.... In the time of his suffering on the
cross, which was in the daytime:

but thou hearest me not; and yet he was always heard, [Joh
11:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#041.md); though he was not saved from
dying, yet he was quickly delivered from the power of death, and so was
heard in that he feared, [Heb 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007.md);

and in the night season: in the night in which he was in the garden,
sorrowing and praying, the night in which he was betrayed and was
apprehended; and though the natural desires of his human soul were not
heard and answered, that the cup might pass from him, yet his prayer in
submission to the will of God was: moreover, the daytime and night
season may design the incessant and continual prayer of Christ; he
prayed always, night and day:

and am not silent; but continue to pray, though as yet seemingly not
heard and answered; or there is "no silence to me" (w); that is, no rest
from sorrow and pain; or "no likeness to me" (x), there are none like
me, no sorrow like my sorrow, as in [Lam
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#012.md).

[Psalms 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 22:3</span></span>

But thou art holy,.... Which may be considered either as an argument
with his God, why he should hear and answer him, since he is holy, just,
and faithful; he has promised, when any call upon him in a day of
trouble, he will hear and answer them, and will be glorified by them;
this Christ did, and therefore pleads his faithfulness to his promise:
or rather a reason quieting him under divine desertion, and a sense of
divine wrath, that God was righteous in all his ways, and holy in all
his works; and that whereas he was the surety of his people, and had all
their sins on him, it was perfectly agreeable to the holiness and
justice of God to treat him in the manner he did; yea, it was done to
declare his righteousness, that he might appear to be just, while he is
the justifier of him that believes in him;

O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel; either the place where
Israel offered the sacrifices of praise to God, the tabernacle or
temple, the house of prayer and praise in which Jehovah dwelt: or the
true Israel of God praising him, who are formed for himself, and called
by his grace to show forth his praises; among whom he takes up his
residence: or else the praises themselves; and so the phrase denotes
God's gracious acceptance of them, and well pleasedness in them,
signified by his inhabiting of them, and the frequent and constant
ascription of them to him: and perhaps respect may be had chiefly to the
praises of his people for providing such a Saviour for them, settling
him in the fulness of time, and not sparing him, but delivering him up
into the hands of justice and death for them; and for giving all things
freely with him.

[Psalms 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 22:4</span></span>

Our fathers trusted in thee,.... By whom are meant Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, from whom our Lord descended; and the people of Israel when in
Egypt, in the times of the judges, and in all ages before the coming of
Christ, of whom, as concerning the flesh, or as to his human nature,
Christ came, [Rom 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#005.md); these, as they
were sojourners, and went from place to place, especially the
patriarchs, and were often in trouble and distress, when they called
upon the Lord, looked to him, and put their trust and confidence in him;
not in themselves, their own wisdom, riches, and strength, nor in
others, in any mere creature, nor in any outward thing, or arm of flesh,
but in the Lord Jehovah, in whom is everlasting strength; they believed
in the power of God, that he was able to help and deliver them, and they
had faith in him that he would; they depended upon his word and promise,
and were persuaded he would never suffer his faithfulness to fail; they
committed themselves to the Lord, and stayed themselves upon him;

they trusted; this is repeated not only for the sake of emphasis,
pointing out something remarkable and commendable, and for the greater
certainty of it, more strongly confirming it; or to observe the many
that put their trust in the Lord, the numerous instances of confidence
in him; but also to denote the constancy and continuance of their faith,
they trusted in the Lord at all times;

and thou didst deliver them; out of the hands of all their enemies, and
out of all their sorrows and afflictions; instances of which we have in
the patriarchs, and in the people of Israel when brought out of Egypt,
and through the Red sea and wilderness, and in the times of the judges,
when they were distressed by their neighbours, and God sent them a
deliverer time after time.

[Psalms 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 22:5</span></span>

They cried unto thee, and were delivered,.... As the Israelites did in
Egyptian bondage, and as they in later times did when in distress; see
[Exo 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#023.md); &c. The crying is to be
understood of prayer to God, and sometimes designs mental prayer,
sighing, and groaning, which cannot be uttered, when no voice is heard,
as in Moses, [Exo 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#015.md); but oftener
vocal prayer, put up in times of distress, and denotes the vehemency of
trouble, and eagerness of desire to be heard and relieved; and this cry
was from faith, it followed upon and was accompanied with trusting in
the Lord; it was the prayer of faith, which is effectual and availeth
much, and issued in deliverance;

they trusted in thee, and were not confounded: or ashamed; neither of
the object of their trust, the living God, as those who trust in graven
images; so Moab was ashamed of Chemosh, [Jer
48:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#013.md); nor of their hope and trust in
him, it being such as makes not ashamed, [Psa
119:116](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#116.md), [Rom
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#005.md); nor of the consequences of it;
When men trust in anything and it fails them, and they have not what
they expect by it, they are filled with shame and confusion, [Isa
30:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#002.md); but they that trust in the Lord
are never confounded, or made ashamed; their expectations do not perish:
now Christ mentions this case of his ancestors as a reason of the
praises of Israel, which they offered up to God for deliverances, and
which he inhabited, [Psa 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#003.md); as also
by way of encouragement to himself in his present circumstances, that
though the Lord was at a distance from him, and seemed not to regard him
and his cries, yet that he would deliver him; and likewise as an
argument with God that he would do so, since it had been his wonted way
and method with his fathers before; moreover he may take notice of it in
order to represent his own forlorn, uncomfortable, and deplorable
condition, which was abundantly worse than theirs, and the reverse of
it, as it seemed at present.

[Psalms 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 22:6</span></span>

But I am a worm, and no man,.... Christ calls himself a worm, not
because of his original, for he was not of the earth earthy, but was the
Lord from heaven; nor because of his human nature, man being a worm, and
the Son of Man such, [Job 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#006.md); and
because of his meanness and low estate in that nature, in his
humiliation; nor to express his humility, and the mean thoughts he had
of himself, as David, his type, calls himself a dead dog, and a flea,
[Sa1 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#014.md); but on account of the
opinion that men of the world had of him; so Jacob is called "a worm",
[Isa 41:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#014.md); not only because mean in
his own eyes, but contemptible in the eyes of others. The Jews esteemed
Christ as a worm, and treated him as such; he was loathsome to them and
hated by them; everyone trampled upon him and trod him under foot as men
do worms; such a phrase is used of him in [Heb
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#029.md); there is an agreement in some
things between the worm and Christ in his state of humiliation; as in
its uncomeliness and disagreeable appearance; so in Christ the Jews
could discern no form nor comeliness wherefore he should be desired; and
in its weakness, the worm being an impotent, unarmed, and defenceless
creatures, hence the Chaldee paraphrase renders it here "a weak worm";
and though Christ is the mighty God, and is also the Son of Man whom God
made strong for himself, yet mere was a weakness in his human nature and
he was crucified through it, [Co2
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#004.md); and it has been observed by
some, that the word here used signifies the scarlet worm, or the worm
that is in the grain or berry with which scarlet is dyed; and like, is
scarlet worm did our Lord look, when by way of mockery be was clothed
with a scarlet robe; and especially when he appeared in his dyed
garments, and was red in his apparel, as one that treadeth in the wine
fat; when his body was covered with blood when he hung upon the cross,
which was shed to make crimson and scarlet sins as white as wool. When
Christ says he was "no man", his meaning is, not that he was not truly
and really man, for he assumed a true body and a reasonable soul; he
partook of the same flesh and blood with his children, and was in all
things made like unto his brethren, excepting sin; but that he was a man
of no figure, he bore no office, and had no title of honour; he was not
a Rabbi, nor a member of the Jewish sanhedrim; he had no share of
government, either in the civil or ecclesiastic state; he was a
carpenter's son, and a carpenter; nor was he treated as a man, but in
the most inhuman manner; he was despised and rejected of men, he was
called a madman, and said to have a devil;

a reproach of men; he was reproached by men, as if he had been the worst
of men; the reproaches of God and of his people all fell on him,
insomuch that his heart was broken with them; see [Psa
69:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#007.md); and it was reckoned a reproach
to men to be seen in his company, or to be thought to belong to him, and
be a disciple of his; hence some, who believed he was the Messiah, yet
would not confess him, because they loved the praise of men more than
the praise of God, [Joh 12:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#042.md);

and despised of the people; rejected with contempt as the Messiah,
refused with scorn as the stone of Israel, disallowed of men, and set at
nought by them; by "the people" are meant the people of the Jews, his
own people and nation; which contempt of him they signified both by
gestures and words, as in the following verses.

(When the female of the scarlet worm species was ready to give birth to
her young, she would attach her body to the trunk of a tree, fixing
herself so firmly and permanently that she would never leave again. The
eggs deposited beneath her body were thus protected until the larvae
were hatched and able to enter their own life cycle. As the mother died,
the crimson fluid stained her body and the surrounding wood. From the
dead bodies of such female scarlet worms, the commercial scarlet dyes of
antiquity were extracted. (x) What a picture this gives of Christ, dying
on the tree, shedding his precious blood that he might "bring many sons
unto glory" ([Heb 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010).md)! He died for
us, that we might live through him! [Psa
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#006.md) describes such a worm and gives
us this picture of Christ. (cf. [Isa
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#018)) Editor..md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 22:7</span></span>

All they that see me laugh me to scorn,.... To the afflicted pity should
be shown; but instead or pitying him in his distresses they laughed at
him; this must be understood of the soldiers when they had him in
Pilate's hall, and of the Jews in general when he hung upon the cross;
some particular persons must be excepted, as John the beloved disciple,
the mother of our Lord, Mary Magdalene, and some other women, who stood
afar off beholding him;

they shoot out the lip; or "open with the lip" (y); they made mouths at
him, they put out their lips, or gaped upon him with their mouths, and
in a way of sport and pastime made wide mouths and drew out their
tongues, as in [Job 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#010.md);

they shake the head, saying; in a way of scorn and derision, as in [Lam
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#015.md). This was fulfilled in the Jews,
[Mat 27:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#039.md).

[Psalms 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 22:8</span></span>

He trusted on the Lord, that he would deliver him,.... Not that they
spoke in a deriding way of the object of his trust, for, as impious as
they were, this they did not do; but of his trust in the Lord, which
they looked upon to be a false one, as would appear by his not being
delivered, as he trusted; but his confidence was a well grounded one,
though jeered at by these men, and he was delivered in the Lord's own
time and way from all his enemies, and out of all his troubles;

let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him; this is another
ironical sarcastic flout, not at God, but at Christ, and at his
profession of trust in God, his claim of interest in his favour, and of
relation to him as being the Son of his love, in whom he was well
pleased; he always was the delight of his Father; he expressed his well
pleasedness in him at his baptism, and transfiguration on the mount; he
took pleasure in him while he was suffering and dying in the room and
stead of his people; and he delivered him, raised him from the dead, and
brought him into a large place, because he delighted in him, [Psa
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#019.md); These very words were said by
the Jews concerning Christ, as he hung upon the cross, [Mat
27:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#043.md).

[Psalms 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 22:9</span></span>

But thou art he that took me out of the womb,.... The Papists affirm,
that there was something miraculous in the manner of Christ's coming
into the world, as well as in his conception; that his conception of a
virgin was miraculous is certain, being entirely owing to the wonderful
and mysterious overshadowing of the Holy Ghost, and which was necessary
to preserve his human nature from the contagion of sin, common to all
that descend from Adam by ordinary generation; that so that individual
of human nature might be proper to be united to the Son of God, and that
it might be a fit sacrifice for the sins of men; but otherwise in all
other things, sin only excepted, he was made like unto us; and it is a
clear case, that his mother bore him the usual time, and went with him
her full time of nine months, as women commonly do; see [Luk
1:56](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#056.md); and it is as evident that he was
born and brought forth in the same manner other infants are, seeing he
was presented, to the Lord in the temple, and the offering was brought
for him according to the law respecting the male that opens the womb,
[Luk 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#022.md); and the phrase that is here
used is expressive of the common providence of God which attends such an
event, every man being as it were midwifed into the world by God
himself; see [Job 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#018.md); though there
was, no doubt, a peculiar providence which attended the birth of our
Lord, and makes this expression more peculiarly applicable to him; since
his mother Mary, when her full time was come, was at a distance from the
place of her residence, was in an inn, and in a stable there, there
being no room for her in the inn, and so very probably had no women
about her to assist her, nor any midwife with her; and there was the
more visible appearance of the hand of God in this affair, who might
truly be said to take him out of the womb:

thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts; which may
be understood of the expectation and hope, common to infants, which have
not the use of reason, with all creatures, whose eyes wait upon the
Lord, and he gives them their meat in due season; and here may regard
the sudden and suitable provision of milk in the mother's breast, to
which there is in the infant a natural desire, and an hope and
expectation of. The words may be rendered, as they are by some, "thou
didst keep me in safety", or make me safe and secure (z), when I was
"upon my mother's breast": this was verified in Christ at the time Herod
sought to take away his life; he was then in his mother's arms, and
sucked at her breast; when the Lord in a dream acquainted Joseph with
Herod's design, and directed him to flee with the young child and his
mother into Egypt, where they were kept in safety till the death of
Herod. This sense of the words frees them from a difficulty, how the
grace of hope, or of faith and confidence, can, in a proper sense, be
exercised in the infant state; for though the principle of grace may be
implanted so early, yet how it should be exercised when there is not the
due use of reason is not easy to conceive; if, therefore, the words are
taken in this sense, the meaning must be, that he was caused to hope as
soon as he was capable of it, which is sometimes the design of such a
phrase; see [Job 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#018.md); unless we
suppose something extraordinary in Christ's human nature, which some
interpreters are not willing to allow, because he was in all things like
unto us excepting sin; but I see not, that seeing the human nature was
an extraordinary one, was perfectly holy from the first of it, the grace
of God was upon it as soon as born, and it was anointed with the Holy
Ghost above its fellows, why it may not be thought to exercise grace in
an extraordinary manner, so early as is here expressed, literally
understood.

[Psalms 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 22:10</span></span>

I was cast upon thee from the womb,.... Either by himself, trusting in
God, hoping in him, and casting all the care of himself upon him; or by
his parents, who knew the danger he was exposed to, and what schemes
were laid to take away his life; and therefore did, in the use of all
means they were directed to, commit him to the care and protection of
God: the sense is, that the care of him was committed to God so early;
and he took the care of him and gave full proof of it:

thou art my God from my mother's belly: God was his covenant God from
everlasting, as he loved his human nature, chose it to the grace of
union, and gave it a covenant subsistence; but he showed himself to be
his God in time, and that very early, calling him from the womb, and
making mention of his name from his mother's belly, and preserving him
from danger in his infancy; and it was his covenant interest in God,
which, though mentioned last, was the foundation of all his providential
care of him and goodness to him. Now all these early appearances of the
power and providence of God, on the behalf of Christ as man, are spoken
of in opposition to the scoffs and flouts of his enemies about his trust
in God, and deliverance by him, and to encourage his faith and
confidence in him; as well as are so many reasons and arguments with God
yet to be with him, help and assist him, as follows.

[Psalms 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 22:11</span></span>

Be not far from me,.... Who had been so near unto him, as to take him
out of the womb, and to take the care of him ever since; this is to be
understood not with respect to the omnipresence of God, who is
everywhere, and is not far from any of us; but of his presence, which
was now withdrawn from Christ, and he was filled with a sense of divine
wrath, and with sorrow and distress; and also of his powerful and
assisting presence which he had promised, and Christ expected, and
believed he should have, as he had: the reasons for it follow:

for trouble is near; Satan was marching towards him with his
principalities and powers, to attack him in the garden and on the cross;
Judas, one of his own disciples, was at hand to betray him; a multitude
with swords and staves were about to seize him; the sins and
chastisement of his people were just going to be laid upon him; the
sword of justice was awaked against him, ready to give the blow; the
hour of death was near, he was brought to the dust of it, as in [Psa
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#015.md). A second reason is given,

for there is none to help; none among his disciples: one of them was to
betray him, another to deny him, and all to forsake him and flee from
him, as they did; nor any among the angels in heaven; for though they
ministered to him in the wilderness, and strengthened him in the garden,
there were none near him on the cross, that it might be manifest that
salvation was wrought out alone by him, [Isa
63:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#005.md); and, indeed, if any of these had
been willing to have helped him, it was not in their power to do it,
none but God could; and therefore he applies to him, who had promised
and was as good as his word, [Isa
49:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#008.md).

[Psalms 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 22:12</span></span>

Many bulls have compassed me,.... By whom are meant the chief priests,
elders, Scribes, and Pharisees, among the Jews, and Herod and Pontius
Pilate among the Gentiles, comparable to bulls for their fierceness,
rage, and fury against Christ, [Psa
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md); and for their pushing at him with
their horns of power and authority, and for their trampling him under
their feet, his person and offices; these compassed him about at his
apprehension, arraignment, trial, and condemnation; and there were many
of them to one child, Jesus:

strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round; Bashan was a very fruitful
country, in which cattle of various sorts, and bulls among the rest,
were fed and fattened; see [Deu 32:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#014.md);
bulls are noted for their strength in other writers (a). Hence great
men, who abounded in riches and power, and used them to the oppression
of the poor, are compared to the kine of Bashan, [Amo
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#001.md); and a very fit name this was for
the kings and princes of the earth; for Caiaphas, Annas, and the chief
priests, that lived upon the fat of the land, who beset Christ around,
and employed all their power and policy to take him and bring him to
death; nor is it unusual with Heathen writers (b) to compare great
personages to bulls.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 22:13</span></span>

They gaped upon me with their mouths,.... Either by way of derision and
contempt, [Job 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#010.md); or belching out
blasphemy against him, or rather, with the greatest vehemency, crying
out "Crucify him, crucify him", [Luk
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#021.md); and this they did

as a ravening and roaring lion, when it has got its prey and rejoices,
[Amo 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#004.md); and being in such hands, and
encompassed about with such enemies, as Christ was in the garden, in the
high priest's hall, and in Pilate's judgment hall, is a third reason or
argument used by him with God his Father, to be near to him and not far
from him.

[Psalms 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 22:14</span></span>

I am poured out like water,.... This may refer to Christ's sweat in the
garden, when through his agony or conflict with Satan, and his vehemency
in prayer, and the pressure on his mind, in a view of his people's sins,
and the wrath of God for, them, and the accursed death he was about to
undergo on that account, sweat in great abundance came from all parts of
his body, and not only stood in large drops, but fell to the ground like
great drops of blood; so that his body was all covered with water, or
rather seemed to be dissolving into water, or else to the quantity of
tears he shed both there and elsewhere; his sorrow was great even unto
death, which vented itself in floods of tears; his prayers were offered
up with strong crying and tears; his head was, as Jeremiah wished his
might be, as waters, and his eyes a fountain of tears, yea, his whole
body seemed to be bathed with them: or else to the shedding of his
blood, and the pouring out his soul unto death for his people, which was
voluntarily done by himself, or by his enemies; which they shed like
water, and made no account of it, [Psa
79:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#003.md). Some have thought this respects
the opinion some had of him, even some of his own disciples, when he was
dead; all their hopes of his being their Redeemer and Saviour being
gone, he was as water spilled on the ground, which cannot be gathered
up; see [Sa2 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#014.md); but rather the
phrase intends his being quite dispirited, his heart failing, his soul
sorrowful unto death, his hands feeble, his knees weak like water, and
he just ready to faint and die; see [Jos
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#005.md), [Eze
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#017.md);

and all my bones are out of joint; not through the stretching of his
body on the cross, which seems to be designed in [Psa
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#017.md); but as it is with persons in a
panic, their joints seem to be loosed, and their bones parting asunder,
their legs tremble, no member can perform its office, but as if everyone
was dislocated and out of its place; see [Psa
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#002.md);

my heart is like wax, it is melted in the midst of my bowels; as wax
melts before the fire, so did the heart of Christ at the wrath and fury
of God, which was poured forth like fire upon him; and which he had a
sense of, when in the garden and on the cross, bearing the sins of his
people, and sustaining the punishment due unto them for it was not
because of his enemies, nor merely at the presence of God, and his
righteous judgments, which is sometimes the case; see [Sa2
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#010.md); but at the apprehension of
divine wrath, and feeling the same, as the surety of his people; and
what an idea does this give of the wrath of God! for if the heart of
Christ, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, melted at it, what heart can
endure, or hands be strong, when God deals with them in his wrath? [Eze
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#014.md).

[Psalms 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 22:15</span></span>

My strength is dried up like a potsherd,.... The radical moisture of his
body was dried up through his loss of blood and spirits, and through the
violent fever upon him, brought on him by his being hurried from court
to court; and which generally attends persons under a panic, in
consternation and fear of danger and death, and at crucifixion; or this
was occasioned by the inward sorrow and distress of his mind, which
affected his body and dried his bones, as a broken spirit is said to do,
[Pro 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#022.md); and chiefly it was brought
upon him through the sense he had the wrath of God, which like fire
dried up his strength, just as a potsherd burnt in a furnace; which
expresses his dolorous sufferings, which were typified by the passover
lamb being roasted with fire, and the manna being baked in pans;

and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; so that he could not, or rather would
not, speak; this phrase sometimes signifying silence, [Job
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#010.md), [Eze
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#026.md). Thus Christ answered not a word
to the charges of the false witnesses before the high priest, nor to the
accusations of the chief priests and elders before Pilate; nor did he
open his mouth, when he was led to be crucified, neither against the law
and justice of God, nor against his people for whom he suffered, nor
against his enemies who used him cruelly; when he was reviled he reviled
not again; but rather this was occasioned by thirst, through the violent
fever that was upon him; see [Lam 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#004.md);
Hence, when he hung upon the cross, he said, "I thirst", [Joh
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#028.md);

and thou hast brought me into the dust of death; meaning either death
itself, which brings to the dust, and which is signified in this psalm
by going down to it, [Psa 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#029.md); or
the grave, where the body crumbles into dust, and where it is covered
with dust, and therefore is said to sleep in the dust of the earth, [Dan
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002.md); and accordingly the Targum
renders it here, "thou hast shut me up in the house of the grave": now
Christ both died and was laid in the grave, though he did not lie there
so long as to corrupt and decompose, yet he might be truly said to be
laid in the dust: and this is attributed to God, to his counsel,
disposal, and Providence; and even whatever was done to Christ
antecedent to his death, and which led on to it, were what God's hand
and counsel had determined to be done; and though it was with wicked
hands the Jews took Christ and used him in the manner after related, and
crucified and slew him, he was delivered to them by the determinate
counsel and foreknowledge of God; and by these he was delivered into the
hands of justice, and brought to death itself, [Act
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#023.md).

[Psalms 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 22:16</span></span>

For dogs have compassed me,.... By whom are meant wicked men, as the
following clause shows; and so the Chaldee paraphrase renders it, "the
wicked who are like to many dogs"; and to these such are often compared
in Scripture, [Mat 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#006.md); and it may be
the Roman soldiers, who were Gentiles, may be chiefly intended, whom the
Jews used to call dogs, [Mat 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#026.md);
these assembled together in Pilate's hall and surrounded Christ, and
made sport with him; to these were committed the execution of him, they
crucified him, and sat around him watching him while on the cross, as
they also did when in the grave: some have thought the dregs of the
Jewish people are designed, the common people, such as Job says he would
not set with the dogs of his flock, [Job
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#001.md); who encompassed Christ on the
cross, wagging their heads at him; though I see not but that all of
them, even the chief among them, the high priest, sanhedrim, Scribes,
and Pharisees, may be intended; who are so called because of their
impurity in themselves; for their avarice and covetousness, being greedy
dogs that could never have enough; and for their impudence, calumnies,
malice, and envy, against Christ: the allusion seems to be to hunting
dogs, who, when they have got the creature they have been in pursuit of,
surround it and fall upon it. Christ, in the title of this psalm, is
called Aijeleth Shahar, "the morning hind", who was hunted by the Jews,
and at last surrounded and taken by them;

the assembly of the wicked have enclosed me; the Jewish sanhedrim, the
chief priests and elders, who assembled together to consult his death,
before whom he was brought when taken; and in, the midst of whom he was
set and examined, and by them unanimously condemned; and who,
notwithstanding all their pretensions to religion, were a set of wicked
men: and also the whole congregation of the Jews, the body of the
people, who were united in their request for his crucifixion and death;
and who in great numbers got together, and in a circle stood around him
when on the cross, insulting him;

they pierced my hands and my feet; by nailing them to the cross, which,
though not related by the evangelists, is plainly suggested in [Joh
20:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#025.md); and is referred to in other
passages of Scripture, [Zac 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010.md); and
clearly points at the kind of death Christ should die; the death, of the
cross, a shameful and painful one. In this clause there is a various
reading; in some copies in the margin it is, "as a lion my hands and my
feet", but in the text, "they have dug" or "pierced my hands and my
feet"; both are joined together in the Targum, "biting as a lion my
hands and my feet"; as it is by other interpreters (c); and Schultens
(d) retains the latter, rendering the preceding clause in connection
with it thus,

"the assembly of the wicked have broken me to pieces, as a lion, my
hands and my feet.''

In the Targum, in the king of Spain's Bible, the phrase, "as a lion", is
left out. The modern Jews are for retaining the marginal reading, though
without any good sense, and are therefore sometimes charged with a
wilful and malicious corruption of the text; but without sufficient
proof, since the different reading in some copies might be originally
occasioned by the similarity of the letters and and therefore finding it
in their copies, or margin, sometimes and sometimes have chose that
which best suits their purpose, and is not to be wondered at; however,
their "masoretic" notes, continued by them, sufficiently clear them from
such an imputation, and direct to the true reading of the words; in the
small Masorah on the text it is observed that the word is twice used as
here pointed, but in two different senses; this is one of the places;
the other is [Isa 38:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#013.md); where the
sense requires it should be read "as a lion": wherefore, according to
the authors of that note, it must have a different sense here, and not
to be understood of a lion; the larger Masorah, in [Num
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#009.md); observes the word is to be found
in two places, in that place and in [Psa
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#016.md); and adds to that, it is written
"they pierced"; and Ben Chayim confirms (e) this reading, and says he
found it so written it, some correct copies, and in the margin and so it
is written in several manuscripts; and which is confirmed by the Arabic,
Syriac, Ethiopic, Greek, and Vulgate Latin versions; in which it is
rendered, "they dug my hands and my feet"; and so took it to be a verb
and not a noun: so Apollinarius in his metaphrase; and which is also
confirmed by the points; though taking for a participle, as the Targum,
that reading may be admitted, as it is by some learned men (f), who
render it "digging" or "piercing", and so has the same sense, deriving
the word either from or which signify to dig, pierce, or make hollow;
and there are many instances of plural words which end in the omitted,
being cut off by an apocope; see [Sa2
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#008.md); and either way the words are
expressive of the same thing, and manifestly point to the sufferings of
Christ, and that kind of death he should die, the death of the cross,
and the nailing of his hands and feet to it, whereby they were pierced.
This passage is sometimes applied by the Jews (g) themselves to their
Messiah.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 22:17</span></span>

I may tell all my bones,.... For what with the stretching out of his
body on the cross, when it was fastened to it as it lay on the ground,
and with the jolt of the cross when, being reared up, it was fixed in
the ground, and with the weight of the body hanging upon it, all his
bones were disjointed and started out; so that, could he have seen them,
he might have told them, as they might be told by the spectators who
were around him; and so the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Arabic, and
Ethiopic versions render it, "they have numbered all my bones"; that is,
they might have done if: the Targum is, "I will number all the scars of
my members", made by the blows, scourges, and wounds he received;

they look and stare upon me; meaning not his bones, but his enemies;
which may be understood either by way of contempt, as many Jewish
interpreters explain it: so the Scribes and elders of the people, and
the people themselves, looked and stared at him on the cross, and mocked
at him, and insulted him; or by way of rejoicing, saying, "Aha, aha, our
eye hath seen", namely, what they desired and wished for, [Psa
35:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#021.md); a sight as was enough to have
moved an heart of stone made no impression on them; they had no sympathy
with him, no compassion on him, but rejoiced at his misery: this staring
agrees with their character as dogs.

[Psalms 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 22:18</span></span>

They part my garments among them,.... Such as died the death of the
cross were crucified naked (h), and their clothes were the perquisites
of the executioners; there were four soldiers concerned in the
crucifixion of Christ, and these parted his garments into four parts,
and everyone took his part;

and cast lots on my vesture; which was a seamless coat, wove from the
top to the bottom; and therefore, not willing to rend it, they cast lots
upon it who should have it; all this was exactly fulfilled in Christ,
[Joh 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#023.md).

But be not thou far from me, O Lord,.... See Gill on [Psa

O my strength; Christ as God is the mighty God, the Almighty; as
Mediator, he is the strength of his people; but, as man, God is his
strength; he is the man of his right hand, whom he has made strong for
himself, and whom he has promised his arm shall strengthen, [Psa
80:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#017.md); and therefore he addresses him
in this manner here, saying,

haste thee to help me; his help was alone in God his strength; there
were none that could help him but he, and he seemed to stand afar off
from helping him, [Psa 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001.md); and his
case being so distressed, as is represented in the preceding verses, it
required haste.

[Psalms 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 22:20</span></span>

Deliver my soul from the sword,.... Wicked men, whose tongues were as a
sharp sword, reproaching and blaspheming him, and bearing false witness
against him; and crying out, "Crucify him, crucify him", [Luk
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#021.md); see [Psa
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#012.md); or any instrument of violence,
as the iron bar with which the legs of the malefactors crucified with
him were broken, which he escaped; and the spear which pierced his side,
after he had commended his soul or spirit into the hands of his Father;
or a violent death; for though his death had the appearance of one, he
was taken in a violent manner, and condemned to be put to death, and was
crucified, yet his life was not taken away by men; he laid it down, and
gave up his breath himself;

my darling from the power of the dog, or "my only one" (i); meaning his
life or soul, as before; so called, not because there is but one soul in
the body, but because it was dear and valuable to him; and hence we
render it "darling", an only one being usually the darling of its
parents; so a man's life is dear to him, all that he has will he give
for it, [Job 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#004.md). Christ's life was a
more precious life than any man's, and peculiarly his own, in such sense
as another man's, is not his own; and his soul also was an only one, it
was not polluted with original sin, as the souls of other men are; it
was pure and holy: the word here used is sometimes rendered "desolate"
and "solitary"; see [Psa 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#016.md); and it
may have this sense here, and be translated "my lonely" or "solitary
one" (k); he being forsaken by God, and deserted by his disciples; his
soul was in darkness, sorrow, and distress, wherefore he prays it might
be delivered "from the power of the dog"; either Satan is so called for
his malice and envy, who had put it into the heart of Judas to betray
him, and had filled the Pharisees with envy at him, and who through it
delivered him to Pilate; or the impure, cruel, and wicked Roman
soldiers, and in short all his crucifiers; called in the plural number

Save me from the lion's mouth,.... Either the devil, who is as a roaring
lion, whom Christ overcame both in the garden and on the cross, and
destroyed him and his works; or all his wicked enemies, especially the
most powerful of them, who were in greatest authority, as the chief
priests and elders; so rulers and civil magistrates, who are cruel and
unmerciful, are compared to lions, [Pro
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#015.md);

for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns; some read this as
a prayer like the former, "hear thou me" (l), &c. that is, deliver me;
but according to our version it expresses what God had done, that he had
heard him and saved him; and is used as a reason or argument with him
that he would regard also his other petitions: or it may have respect to
what follows, that since God had heard him, and delivered him out of the
hands of his most powerful enemies, therefore he would declare his name
and praise him; for the unicorn being a very strong creature, and its
strength lying much in its horn, with which it pushes and does mischief;
see [Num 23:22](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#022.md). Christ's strong and
potent enemies are intended here; such as Satan and his principalities
and powers, the sanhedrim of the Jews, Herod, Pontius Pilate, and
others, from whose power he was freed when raised from the dead.
According to Pliny (m), the monoceros, or unicorn, is the fiercest of
wild beasts; in its body like a horse, it has the head of an hart and
feet of an elephant, the tail of a bear, makes a great bellowing; has
one black horn rising up in the middle of the forehead, of two cubits
long; it is denied that it was ever taken alive, which agrees with [Job
39:9](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#009.md); See Gill on [Job

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 22:22</span></span>

I will declare thy name unto my brethren,.... Not those who were more
nearly related to him according to the flesh; for though there were some
who believed in him, and to whom he declared the name of God, as James
and Joses, and Judas and Simon, [Mat
13:55](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#055.md); yet there were others that did
not believe on him, [Joh 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#003.md); nor
those more remotely related to him, as all the Jews, who were his
brethren and kinsmen also according to the flesh; to these indeed he
came and preached, but they received him not; but rather his apostles,
whom he called his brethren, even after his resurrection, and to whom he
appeared and declared the name of God, [Mat
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#010.md); and the five hundred brethren
by whom he was seen at once may be also included; and even all true
believers in him, who through his incarnation, being their "goel" and
near kinsman, stands in such a relation to them, and through their
adoption into his Father's family, his Father being their Father, and
his God their God; which is manifested in regeneration, and evidenced by
their doing the will of God, which is believing in Christ, [Mat
12:49](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#049.md). By the "name" of God is meant,
not anyone of the names by which he is known, as God Almighty, Jehovah,
&c. if any of these could be thought to be designed, the New Testament
name and title of God as the Father of Christ would bid fair for it; but
rather the perfections of God, which appear in Christ, and were
glorified in the work of redemption; or God himself; or else his Gospel,
[Act 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#015.md); and which Christ declared
and manifested to his disciples, both before and after his resurrection,
[Joh 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#006.md); which latter seems here to
be referred unto;

in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee; meaning not the
congregation of the Jews, their synagogue, or temple, where he often
attended on public worship, and preached and praised the Lord; but
rather the company of his disciples, among whom he sung an hymn the
night he was betrayed, and with whom he conversed by times for forty
days after his resurrection: unless the general assembly and church of
the firstborn in heaven is intended, in the midst of which he praised
the Lord, when he ascended on high, led captivity captive, and received
gifts for men; though it seems best to understand this of the church of
God, particularly among the Gentiles, under the Gospel dispensation,
where Christ in his members sings the praise of electing, redeeming, and
calling grace; see [Psa 18:49](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#049.md);
compared with [Rom 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#009.md). This is a
proof of singing of psalms and hymns in Gospel churches, and of its
being a duty to be publicly performed by the members of them, who may
expect the presence of Christ in the midst of his church, seeing he here
promises to be there: these words are applied to Christ in [Heb
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#012.md).

[Psalms 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 22:23</span></span>

Ye that fear the Lord, praise him,.... By whom are meant, not the
proselytes among the Gentiles, as distinct from the Jews, which is the
sense of some Jewish interpreters (n); but all the people of God,
whether Jews or Gentiles, who have the grace of filial and godly fear
put into their hearts, with which they worship God, and walk before him
in all holy conversation; which is not a fear of wrath, or a distrust of
divine goodness; but is a reverential affection for God, and is
consistent with the greatest degree of faith, the strongest expressions
of spiritual joy and holy courage: it includes the whole worship of God,
internal and external; and such who have it in their hearts, and before
their eyes, are called upon by Christ to praise the Lord for him, for
the unspeakable gift of his love; that he has not spared his son, but
delivered him up for them, to undergo so much sorrow, and such
sufferings as before related, to obtain salvation for them; and that he
has delivered him out of them, raised him from the dead, and has given
him glory;

all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; not the natural, but spiritual
seed of Jacob, who walk in the steps of the faith of that man of God;
these are exhorted to glorify the Lord with their bodies and spirits,
which are his, being redeemed with the precious blood of Christ; by
believing in him, glorying in him, and offering praise unto him;

and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel; who are the same with the seed
of Jacob, Jacob and Israel being two names of the same person; and
design not Israel according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit;
the whole Israel of God, the all spiritual seed of Israel, who are
justified in Christ, and are saved in him; they are the same with them
that fear the Lord, and are here stirred up to exercise the grace of
fear upon him; to fear him only, and not men, though ever so mighty and
powerful, as before described in [Psa
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#012.md); and that not only because of
his power and greatness; but because of his grace and goodness, as shown
forth in Christ Jesus.

[Psalms 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">psa 22:24</span></span>

For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the
afflicted,.... That is, Christ, who was afflicted by men, both by their
tongues, and by their hands; by devils, by the temptations of Satan for
Christ suffered being tempted, though he was not overcome; and by his
attacks upon him, both in the garden and on the cross; and by the Lord
himself, Jehovah his Father, who laid on him the iniquity and
chastisement of his people, bruised him, and put him to grief; awoke the
sword of justice against him, and spared him not: his afflictions were
many, both in body and soul; in body, being scourged, buffeted, bruised,
pierced, racked, and tortured on the cross; in soul, being made
exceeding sorrowful, and an offering for sin; sustaining his Father's
wrath, and seeking and enduring affliction by the rod of it; see [Isa
53:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004.md); now, though his afflictions and
sufferings were despised by men, and he was despised and abhorred on
account of them; yet not by his Father, he took pleasure in them, and in
him as suffering for his people; not simply considered, as if he
delighted in his sufferings as such, but as they were agreeable to his
counsel and covenant, and brought about the salvation of his chosen
ones: he accepted them in the room and stead of his people; the
sacrifice of Christ was of a sweet smelling savour to him; he was well
pleased with his righteousness, his law being magnified and made
honourable by it; and his death was precious in his sight, being the
propitiation for the sins of his people; so far was he from despising
and abhorring the afflictions of his son. And this is mentioned as a
reason or argument for praise and thanksgiving in them that fear the
Lord; since God has looked upon the redemption price his Son has paid
for them sufficient; has not despised, but accepted of it as the ransom
of their souls: some render the words, "the prayer of the afflicted"; so
the Targum, and the Septuagint version, and the versions that follow
that; which agrees with the next words:

neither hath he hid his face from him; when men did, as ashamed of him,
[Isa 53:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#003.md); for though he forsook him
for a while, and in a little wrath hid his face from him for a moment,
that he might bear the whole curse of the law for us; yet he returned
again, and did not hide his face from him for even;

but when he cried unto him, he heard; cried not only on account of his
crucifiers, that God would forgive them; but on account of himself, that
he would not be afar off from him; that he would take his spirit or soul
into his hands, into which he committed it; that he would deliver him
from the power of death and the grave, and loose their bands; in all
which he was heard, [Heb 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007.md).

[Psalms 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 22:25</span></span>

My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation,.... Or, "my praise
is from thee" (o); not that he should have praise of God, as he had,
when he was received up into heaven, and set down at the right hand of
God; but that God should be the object of his praise, as he was the
cause of it; his salvation and deliverance of him, and resurrection from
the dead, and exaltation of him, were the occasion and matter of it: the
place where Christ determined to praise the Lord is "the great
congregation"; either his apostles, who, though a little flock, yet, on
account of their extraordinary office and gifts, and peculiar
privileges, were the greatest congregation that ever was in the world;
or the five hundred brethren to whom Christ appeared at once after his
resurrection; or else the whole church under the Gospel dispensation; in
the midst of which Christ is, and who in the members of it praises the
name of the Lord; and this especially will have its accomplishment at
the latter day, when great multitudes will be converted, and the voice
of praise and thanksgiving will be among them, [Rev
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009.md);

I will pay my vows before them that fear him; either those which he made
in the council and covenant of grace, when he engaged to become a surety
for his people, to assume their nature, to suffer and die for them, to
redeem them from sin and misery, and bring them nigh to God, and save
them with an everlasting salvation; all which he has openly done; see
[Psa 31:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#019.md); or those which he made in
[Psa 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#021.md); that he would declare the
name of the Lord unto his brethren, and sing praise unto him in the
midst of the church; compare with this [Psa

[Psalms 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">psa 22:26</span></span>

The meek shall eat and be satisfied,.... Such who, being made thoroughly
sensible of sin, look upon themselves the chief of sinners, and the
least of saints; and being truly convicted of the insufficiency of their
own righteousness, wholly trust to and rely on the righteousness of
Christ; and, being acquainted with their impotency and inability to do
any good thing of themselves, ascribe all to the grace of God, and have
no dependence on anything done by them; who are willing to be instructed
and reproved by the meanest saint; are not easily provoked to wrath;
patiently bear indignities and affronts, and are gentle unto all men:
these shall "eat" the fat and drink the sweet of Christ the bread of
lift; they shall eat of his flesh by faith, which is meat indeed; they
shall find the word, and eat it; feed on the wholesome words of Christ,
the words of faith and good doctrine, and shall be "satisfied", or
"filled": other food is not satisfying; it proves gravel, ashes, and
wind; it is not bread, and satisfies not; but such as hunger and thirst
after Christ and his righteousness, and are poor in their own eyes, meek
and humble; these are filled with good things to satisfaction, [Mat
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#006.md); Jarchi interprets these words of
the time of the redemption and the days of the Messiah;

they shall praise the Lord that seek him; in Christ, with their whole
heart; who being filled by him and satisfied, bless the Lord for their
spiritual food and comfortable repast, as it becomes men to do for their
corporeal food, [Deu 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#010.md);

your heart shall live for ever; this is an address of Christ to them
that fear the Lord, the seed of Jacob and Israel; the meek ones, and
that seek the Lord, his face and favour, and who eat and are satisfied;
signifying, that they should be revived and refreshed, should be
cheerful and comfortable; should live by faith on Christ now, and have
eternal life in them; and should live with him for ever hereafter, and
never die the second death.

[Psalms 22:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">psa 22:27</span></span>

All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the Lord,....
That is, all the elect of God among the Gentiles, who live in the
farthermost parts of the world, for whom Christ is appointed to be their
salvation, and whom he calls to look to him for it; these shall remember
the Lord whom they have forgotten, and against whom they have sinned,
how great and how good he is; they shall be put in mind of their sins
and iniquities committed against him, and call to mind their latter end;
and consider, that after death will come judgment to which they must be
brought; they shall be apprised of the grace and goodness of God in
Christ, in providing and sending him to be the Saviour of lost sinners,
by his sufferings and death, at large described in this psalm; which
will encourage them to turn unto the Lord, since they may hope for full
pardon of sin, through his blood and sacrifice; and to turn from their
idols, and from all their evil ways, and from all dependence on
themselves or on creatures, to trust in and serve the living God in
faith and fear; which turning is usually brought about under and by the
ministry of the word; which is appointed to turn men from darkness to
light, and from the power of Satan unto God; and has this effect when it
is attended with the Spirit and power of God; for conversion is not the
work of man, neither of ministers nor of men themselves, but of God, in
which men are at first passive; they are turned, and then, under the
influence of grace, become active, and turn to the Lord, by believing in
him, and so cleave unto him: and likewise remembrance of the above
things is not owing to themselves, but to the Spirit of God, who puts
them into their minds; and which is very necessary and essential to
conversion, even as a remembrance of past things is necessary to a
restoration after backslidings, which is a second conversion;

and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee; not only
externally, by praying before the Lord, and attending on his word and
ordinances; but internally, in spirit and in truth, which worshippers
the Lord seeks; such spiritual worship being suitable to his nature, and
such worshippers believers in him are; this must be understood of some
of all nations, kindred and tongues, whom Christ has redeemed by his
blood, and calls by his grace; see [Zac
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016.md).

[Psalms 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">psa 22:28</span></span>

For the kingdom is the Lord's,.... Not the kingdom of nature and
providence, though that is the Lord Christ's; but the kingdom of grace,
the mediatorial kingdom: this was Christ's by the designation and
constitution of his Father from eternity; the government of the church
was always upon his shoulders during the Old Testament dispensation;
when he came into this world, he came as a King; though his kingdom
being not of this world, it came not with observation; but upon his
ascension to heaven, whither he went to receive a kingdom and return, he
was made or declared Lord and Christ, and was exalted as a Prince, as
well as a Saviour; and in consequence of his being set down at the right
hand of God, he sent forth the rod of his strength, his Gospel, into the
Gentile world, which was succeeded to the conversion of multitudes of
them, among whom he has had a visible kingdom and interest ever since;
and which will more abundantly appear in the latter day, when he shall
be King over all the earth; and now this is a reason why so many, in the
distant parts of the world, and among all the kindreds of the nations,
shall remember, turn to him, and worship him;

and he is the Governor among the nations; he rules in the hearts of some
by his Spirit and grace, and over others with a rod of iron.

[Psalms 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">psa 22:29</span></span>

All they that be fat upon earth,.... Rich men, who abound in worldly
substance, are in very flourishing and prosperous circumstances, of whom
for the most part this is literally true; yea, by these sometimes are
meant princes, rulers, the chief among the people in power and
authority, as well as in riches; see [Psa
78:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#031.md); the phrase may design such who
are in prosperous circumstances in their souls, in spiritual things, in
faith, comfort, and spiritual joy, [Psa
92:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#014.md); but the former sense is best:
Jarchi inverts the words, "they shall eat", that is, the meek shall eat,
"all the fat of the earth, and worship"; which may be understood of the
spiritual blessings of grace, which converted persons shall feed and
live upon, [Psa 63:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#005.md); the allusion may
be to the fat parts of the earth, and what grows thereon, made so by
ashes, which the word used has the signification of; for some lands are
fattened by ashes being strewed upon them (p); but rather the rich and
great men of the earth are intended, who yet are but dust and ashes.
They

shall eat, and worship; for as, in the first times of the Gospel, not
many mighty and noble were called, yet some were; so more especially, in
the latter day, many of this sort will be called, even kings and queens;
who will not live upon their titles of honour, their grandeur and glory,
but upon Christ and his Gospel, and will fall down before him, and serve
and worship him; see [Psa 72:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#010.md);

all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him; such as are in
mean circumstances of life; so that both rich and poor shall serve him;
or who are mean in their own eyes, sit in the dust of self-abhorrence,
and put their mouths in the dust, are in a low condition, out of which
the Lord raises them, [Psa 113:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#007.md). The
Targum paraphrases it, "who go down to the house of the grave"; that is,
the dead; and then the sense is, that Christ is the Lord, both of the
dead and living, and that those that are under the earth, and are
reduced to dust, as well as they that live and are fat upon it, shall
bow the knee to Christ, when raised again, who is the Judge of quick and
dead; see [Rom 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#009.md), [Phi
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010.md);

and none can keep alive his own soul; as no man can quicken himself when
dead in trespasses and sins; so when he is made alive, he cannot
preserve his life, nor nourish himself, nor make himself lively and
comfortable, nor cause his heart to live, as in [Psa
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#026.md); but by eating the flesh, and
drinking the blood of Christ, feeding and living upon him by faith:
though some take the sense to be, that such as are before described as
converted persons, will not seek to save their lives, but will freely
lay them down and part with them for Christ's sake; but rather the
meaning is, that so universal will the kingdom of Christ be, as that
high and low, rich and poor, will be bowing to him; whoever are his
enemies, and will not have him to rule over them, will be brought before
him and slain, and none of them will be able to save themselves; so the
Targum, "he will not quicken", or "keep alive, the soul of the wicked";
or as Jarchi interprets it,

"he will have no mercy on them, to keep their souls alive from hell.''

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">psa 22:30</span></span>

A seed shall serve him,.... That is, Christ shall always have a seed to
serve him in every age; a remnant according to the election of grace;
see [Rom 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#029.md); so that as the former
verses speak of the amplitude of Christ's kingdom, through the calling
of the Gentiles, these words and the following express the duration of
it: and this "seed" either means Christ's seed; so the Septuagint
version, and others that follow it, render it, "my seed"; the spiritual
seed and offspring of Christ, which the Father has given him, and which
shall endure for ever, [Isa 53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010.md); or
else the church's seed, which comes to the same thing; not the natural
seed of believers, but a succession of godly men in the church, who are
born in her, and nursed up at her side; see [Isa
59:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#021.md); such shall, and do, in every
age serve Christ, willingly and cheerfully, in righteousness and true
holiness, without slavish fear, and yet with reverence and godly fear.
The Chaldee paraphrase is, "the seed of Abraham shall serve before him";
but this seed designs not the Jews only, but the Gentiles also, and
chiefly;

it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation; of his people, his
children whom he accounts of, reckons, and esteems as such; or the seed
shall be reckoned to the Lord, as belonging to him, "unto generation";
that is, in every generation (q), throughout all ages, to the end of
time; so the Targum, "to an after generation"; or "a generation to
come".

They shall come,.... One generation after another; there shall always be
a succession of regenerate persons, who shall come to Christ, and to his
churches; and a succession of Gospel ministers among them, who shall
come forth, being sent and qualified by Christ;

and shall declare his righteousness, either the faithfulness of God, in
fulfilling his promises; especially those which respect the mission of
Christ, and salvation by him, as Zacharias did, [Luk
1:68](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#068.md); or rather the righteousness of
Christ, which is revealed in the Gospel, and makes a most considerable
part of the declaration of it, and is published by Gospel ministers in
all ages, as the only justifying righteousness before God: and that

unto a people that shall be born; in successive generations; that shall
be brought upon the stage of time and life; or that shall be born again;
for to such only, in a spiritual and saving way, is the righteousness of
Christ declared, revealed, and applied, by the blessed Spirit, through
the ministry of the word: it is added,

that he hath done this; wrought this righteousness; so Jarchi; that is,
is the author of it; is become the end of the law for it; has finished
it, and brought it in; or else all the great things spoken of in this
psalm, relating to the Messiah, his sufferings, death, and resurrection,
and the calling of the Gentiles; all which are the Lord's doings, and
are what is declared in the Gospel: the Targum is, "the miracles which
he hath done"; the Septuagint version, and those that follow it, connect
this clause with the preceding thus, "to a people that shall be born,
whom the Lord hath made"; made them his people, created them in Christ,
and formed them for himself.
