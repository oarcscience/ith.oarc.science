### [Leviticus Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lev 7:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO LEVITICUS 7

The several things contained in this chapter are the law of the trespass
offering, [Lev 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#001.md) the portion the
priests had in the burnt offerings and meat offerings, [Lev
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#008.md) the law of the peace offerings,
whether by way of thanksgiving, or a vow, or voluntary oblation, [Lev
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#011.md) the prohibition of fat and blood,
[Lev 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#022.md) the parts the priests should
have in the peace offerings, the breast and right shoulder, [Lev
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#028.md) and the chapter is concluded with
a recapitulation of the various things contained in this and the
preceding chapters, [Lev 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#037.md).

[Leviticus 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 7:1</span></span>

Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering,.... Or the various
rites and rules to be observed at the offering of it: the persons for
whom it was to be made are described in the two preceding chapters, [Lev
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#001.md) both such that sinned through
ignorance, and knowingly, and here the place and parts of the offering,
and how to be disposed of, are declared:

it is most holy; wholly devoted for sacred use, either to the Lord, or
to his priests; there were some things the Jews call light holy things,
and others most holy in the highest degree, of this sort was the
trespass offering.

[Leviticus 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 7:2</span></span>

In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the
trespass offering,.... See [Lev 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#011.md),

and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon the altar; on
the upper part of it. There was a scarlet thread that was drawn around
the altar in the middle, the blood of some of the sacrifices was
sprinkled below it; and some above it, as was the blood of the trespass
offering.

[Leviticus 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 7:3</span></span>

And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof,.... To the Lord, that
being claimed by him, as in the peace offerings of the herd, and of the
flock, whether a bullock or cow, a lamb or a goat, [Lev
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#003.md), &c. and in the sin offering of
the bullock, [Lev 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#008.md),

and the rump, or tail, which of sheep and rams, for the trespass
offering, was very large and fat in those countries; See Gill on [Exo
29:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#022.md), [Lev
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#009.md),

and the fat that covereth the inwards; called the "omentum".

[Leviticus 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 7:4</span></span>

And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them,.... Which are usually
covered with fat:

which is by the flanks: or rather that which is "upon" them (y); for
this respects not the situation of the kidneys, nor the fat upon them,
but the fat which is upon the flanks, as distinct from that, and where
there are great collops of it, see [Job
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#027.md),

and the caul that is above the liver; the lobe upon the liver, according
to the Septuagint:

with the kidneys, it shall he take away; all the fat before mentioned,
together with the kidneys, were to be taken away from the ram of the
trespass offering, and burnt, as follows.

\(y\) "et qui est superiliis", Tigurine version.

[Leviticus 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 7:5</span></span>

And the priest shall burn them upon the altar,.... Fat taken off of the
several parts before mentioned, and the kidneys: which were to be

for an offering made by fire unto the Lord; and was acceptable to him,
being typical of the offering of Christ, which is a sweet smelling
savour, bearing the fire of divine wrath in the room and stead of his
people:

it is the trespass offering; an offering for a trespass committed, to
make atonement for it; and this part of it, the burning of the fat, was
properly the offering to the Lord, all the rest were the priest's, as
follows.

[Leviticus 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 7:6</span></span>

Every male among the priests shall eat thereof,.... Of the flesh of it,
after the fat was taken off and burnt, the rest belonged to the priests
and their sons, and to them only, not to their wives and daughters:

it shall be eaten in the holy place; in the court of the tabernacle, in
some apartment in it, for that purpose, as afterwards in the temple; it
was not to be carried home to their houses, for all in the family to
partake of, only the priests and their sons were to eat of it:

it is most holy; and therefore none but such who were devoted to holy
services might eat of it; only sanctified persons, true believers, who
are made priests unto God, have a right to eat of the altar Christ, or,
can eat his flesh in a spiritual sense, and feed upon him by faith, and
receive nourishment from him, [Heb
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#010.md).

[Leviticus 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lev 7:7</span></span>

As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering, there is one law
for them,.... The same as in [Lev
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#027.md),

the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have it; who by
offering it made atonement for the trespass of the person that brings
it, as typical of the atonement by the sacrifice of Christ; he was to
have all but what was burnt, for himself and his sons; though no doubt
but other priests then on duty in the court ate with him.

[Leviticus 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lev 7:8</span></span>

And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering,.... In which the
flesh was wholly burnt, and nothing of it remained to requite the priest
for his trouble, as in other offerings:

even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering,
which he hath offered; in some cases the skin itself was burnt, and then
he could have nothing, see [Lev 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#011.md)
but in others the skin was reserved for the priest. There seems to be an
emphasis upon the phrase "to himself", and may signify, that though in
other things other priests might partake with him, yet not in this; and
so Maimonides (z) observes, that the skin was not given to every priest,
but to him that offered the sacrifice; and elsewhere (a) he says, the
skins of light holy things are the owner's, but the skins of the most
holy things are the priest's. And some have thought this law has some
respect to the case of Adam, and is agreeable thereunto; who having
offered sacrifice according to divine directions given him, had coats
made for him and his wife of the skins of the slain beasts; and it was
usual with the Heathen priests to have the skins of the sacrifices, and
in which they slept in their temples and others also were desirous of
the same, in order by dreams or otherwise to get knowledge of things
future; See Gill on [Amo 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#008.md).

[Leviticus 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 7:9</span></span>

And all the meat offering that is baked in the oven,.... Or "every meat
offering" (b), whether dressed in one way or another, and which was done
in one or other of these three ways, of which this was one, baked in an
oven heated for that purpose:

and all that is dressed in the frying pan; such as we call pancakes:

and in the pan; which was different from the frying pan; it seems to be
what was set upon an hearth made hot, and soon baked; See Gill on [Lev
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#021.md) of these three different ways of
dressing the meat offering, see [Lev
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#004.md).

[Leviticus 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 7:10</span></span>

And every meat offering mingled with oil, and dry,.... Rather it should
be rendered "or dry" (c); that is, as Jarchi interprets it, that has no
oil in it; the meat offering in common, let it be dressed in what way
soever, was mingled with oil; but in the poor man's offering for sin,
which was as a meat offering, no oil was to be put upon it, [Lev
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#011.md) but whether the offering was with
or without oil, moist or dry, it

shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as much as another; it was to be
equally divided among them; or a priest offering it at one time, was to
have the same as another priest at another time; it was always alike,
all that remained, except the handful that was burnt, was the priest's.

[Leviticus 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lev 7:11</span></span>

And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which ye shall
offer unto the Lord. Some other laws and rules respecting the oblation
of them: in [Lev 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#001.md) an account is
given of what they should be, both of the herd and flock, and of the
burning of the fat of them; and here the several sorts of them are
distinctly observed, what should be offered with them, and the part the
priest should have of it, and when the flesh of them should be eaten.

[Leviticus 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lev 7:12</span></span>

If he offer it for a thanksgiving,.... Which Jarchi restrains to the
wonderful deliverances of seafaring persons, of travellers, and of such
as have been confined in prison, or have laboured under violent diseases
and disorders of body; and so Aben Ezra seems to understand it only of
thanksgivings on account of being delivered out of distress; but it
might be for the common mercies of life, or any particular mercy or
instance of divine goodness a man was sensible of, and thought proper in
this way to make an acknowledgment of it:

then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving; which, if of the
herd, was either a bullock or a cow; and if of the flock, was either a
lamb or a goat:

unleavened cakes mingled with oil; ten of them, according to the Jewish
writers; the measure of flour, of which they were made, were, as Jarchi
says, five Jerusalem seahs or pecks, which were six of those used in the
wilderness, and made twenty tenths or omers, an omer being the tenth
part of an ephah (d); the oil they were mingled with, as to the quantity
of it, was half a log (e); a fourth part of it was for the cakes,
hastily baked, (said in the latter part of this verse to be fried,) an
eighth part for those baked, (intended in this clause,) and an eighth
part for the wafers next mentioned:

and unleavened wafers anointed with oil; these were a thinner sort of
cakes, made without leaven as the others, but the oil was not mixed with
the flour in the making of them, but put upon them when made, and
therefore said to be anointed with it; there were also ten of these:

and cakes mingled with oil of fine flour fried; these were such as were
hastily and not thoroughly baked, [Lev
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#021.md) or, as Jarchi and Ben Gersom,
they were mixed and boiled with hot water, as much as was sufficient;
or, according to Maimonides (f), were fried in oil; and there were ten
of these, in all thirty,

\(d\) Vid. Misn. Menachot, c. 7. sect. 1. & Bartenora in ib. (e) Maimon.

[Leviticus 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lev 7:13</span></span>

Besides the cakes,.... The unleavened cakes, and the unleavened wafers,
and the fried cakes; or with these, as Aben Ezra and Abendana interpret
it:

he shall offer for his offering leavened bread, with the sacrifice of
thanksgiving of his peace offerings; not that this was offered upon the
altar, for all leaven was forbidden there, [Lev
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#011.md) but it was given to the priest,
that he might have change of bread, and such as was agreeable to him, to
eat with the flesh of the peace offerings he had a share of, and to the
owners also; and the whole of this consisted of ten cakes likewise, as
will appear by what Maimonides (g) says; he (the offerer) takes twenty
tenths of fine flour, and makes ten leavened, and ten unleavened; the
ten leavened he makes into ten cakes, and the ten unleavened he makes of
them eighty cakes alike, ten cakes of every sort, ten cakes baked in an
oven, ten cakes wafers, and ten cakes slightly baked.

\(g\) Maaseh Hakorbanot, c. 9. sect. 17, 18, 21.

[Leviticus 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 7:14</span></span>

And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an heave
offering unto the Lord,.... That is, one out of the unleavened cakes,
and out of the unleavened wafers, and out of the cakes fried, and out of
the cakes leavened; lo, says Aben Ezra, four at least, and the truth is,
adds he, there were ten; and so Maimonides (h) says, the priest took out
of all the four cakes, one out of every sort, as it is said, "and of it
he shall offer one", &c.

and it shall be the priest's that sprinkleth the blood of the peace
offerings; that is, that part of the cakes and bread, which is offered
as an heave offering to the Lord, was the portion of the priests; and so
Maimonides (i) says,"the bread waved (rather heaved) with the thank
offering was eaten by the priests, and the rest of the bread by the
owners.''

[Leviticus 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lev 7:15</span></span>

And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for
thanksgiving,.... Having given directions about the cakes and bread that
went along with the peace offerings, offered in thankfulness for mercies
received; instructions are next given about eating the flesh of them;
and the order is, that that

shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; partly by him that
brought them, and his family, and partly by the poor he was to invite to
eat thereof; and also by the priests and Levites, who were to have their
share of it; see [Deu 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#011.md).

he shall not leave any of it until the morning; which was ordered to
encourage liberality to the priests, Levites, and others, since all must
be eaten up before morning: according to the Jewish canons, they might
eat it no longer than midnight; by that time it was to be all consumed;
and it is said (k), the wise men made an hedge to the law to keep men
from sin.

\(k\) Misn. Zebachim, c. 5. sect. 3.

[Leviticus 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 7:16</span></span>

But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow,.... Be on account of a
vow made, as, that if he was favoured with such and such benefits, or
delivered out of such and such troubles and distresses, then he would
offer such a sacrifice:

or a voluntary offering; without any condition or obligation; what from
the mere motion of his mind he freely offered, not being directed to it
by any command of God, or under any necessity from a vow of his own, and
without any view to; any future good to be enjoyed: Aben Ezra describes
both the one and the other thus; a "vow" which he uttered with his lips
in his distresses, a "voluntary offering", which his spirit made him
willing to bring, a sacrifice to God neither for a vow nor for
thanksgiving:

it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice; that is,
it shall be begun to be eaten then, and if all is eaten up it is very
well, but they were not obliged in either of these cases, as in the
preceding, to eat up all, and leave none to the morning, for it follows:

and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten; some of it,
if thought fit, and could not be conveniently eaten, might be kept till
the day after the sacrifice, but no longer.

[Leviticus 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lev 7:17</span></span>

But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day,....
What remained of it uneaten on the second day, and was kept till the
third:

shall be burnt with fire; that it might neither corrupt, nor be put to
superstitious uses, nor be of any profit in any respect; that so
niggardliness and distrust of the care of Providence might be
discouraged: perhaps some respect may be had in the type to the
resurrection of Christ on the third day, having seen no corruption.

[Leviticus 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lev 7:18</span></span>

And if any of the flesh of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the
third day,.... Any part of it, even the least:

it shall not be accepted; as a sacrifice well pleasing to God; he will
take no delight in it, or express any satisfaction therein; but, on the
contrary, reject it with abhorrence:

neither shall it be imputed to him that offereth it; the Targum of
Jonathan adds, for merit or righteousness; it shall not be accounted a
righteous action, or the offerer receive any benefit by it:

it shall be an abomination; to God, the flesh being kept so long,
through a sordid and niggardly disposition:

and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity; it shall not be
forgiven him; he shall bear the punishment of it.

[Leviticus 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lev 7:19</span></span>

And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten,....
That is, the flesh of the peace offerings; should it be touched by any
unclean person, man or woman; that was so in a ceremonial sense, being
profluvious or menstruous, or having touched anything unclean, or
touched by any unclean creature, as a dog or the like, as it might be
while carried from the tabernacle to any of their tents or houses:

it shall be burnt with fire; that no profit might be had of it; and this
was to make them careful in carrying it from place to place:

and as for the flesh, all that be clean shall eat thereof; that are
clean in a ceremonial sense; as all that are clean in an evangelic
sense, through the blood and righteousness of Christ, may, by faith, eat
his flesh and drink his blood. Jarchi observes, that whereas it is said,
[Deu 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#027.md) "thou shall eat the flesh";
some might object and say, that none might eat of the peace offerings
but the owners of them, therefore it is said here, "all that be clean
shall eat"; not the owners only, nor the priests and Levites only, but
whoever the offerer should invite to eat thereof, provided he was but
clean.

[Leviticus 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lev 7:20</span></span>

But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of the peace
offerings, that pertain unto the Lord,.... That are offered up to him,
and so are holy, and therefore not to be eaten by unholy persons, or by
any

having his uncleanness upon him; a profluvious person that has an issue
running out of him, a gonorrhoea; see [Lev
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#002.md).

even that soul shall be cut off from his people; be disfranchised as an
Israelite, be debarred the privileges of the sanctuary, or be cut off by
death before the usual time and term of man's life; so those that eat
and drink unworthily in the supper of our Lord, where his flesh is eaten
and his blood drank, eat and drink damnation to themselves, [Co1
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#029.md).

[Leviticus 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lev 7:21</span></span>

Moreover, the soul that shall touch any unclean thing,.... Person or
thing, the dead body of a man, or the bone of a dead body, or a grave in
which it was laid:

as the uncleanness of man; the issue that runs from a profluvious
person:

or any unclean beast; that was so by the law ceremonial; see [Lev
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#004.md),

or any abominable unclean thing; which the Targum of Jonathan interprets
of every unclean reptile: see [Lev
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#020.md).

and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which pertain
unto the Lord, even that soul shall be cut off from his people; See Gill
on [Lev 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#020.md).

[Leviticus 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lev 7:22</span></span>

And the Lord spake unto Moses,.... Continued speaking to him:

saying; as follows.

[Leviticus 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">lev 7:23</span></span>

Speak unto the children of Israel, saying,.... Putting them in mind, by
repeating to them the laws concerning fat and blood, [Lev
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#017.md).

ye shall eat no manner of fat; of any creature fit for food, whose flesh
otherwise may be eaten, and particularly

of ox, or of sheep, or of goats: creatures used in sacrifice; though
this is not to be restrained to such of them, and the fat of them that
were sacrificed, whose fat was claimed by the Lord as his, and was burnt
on his altar; but this is to be understood of the fat of these creatures
when killed for their common use, for the food of them and their
families; the fat even of these was not to be eaten; that which was not
separated from the flesh, but mixed with it, might be eaten, but not
that which was separated (l).

\(l\) Bechai in Lev. 3. 17.

[Leviticus 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">lev 7:24</span></span>

And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself,.... Of any disease, and
is not regularly killed:

and the fat of that which is torn with beasts; with wild beasts:

may be used in any other use; as in medicine, for plasters, or for
making candles, or for greasing of anything to make it smooth and
pliable, or the like:

but ye shall in no wise eat of it; such carcasses themselves were not to
be eaten of, and one would think their fat in course must be unlawful;
but however, to prevent the doing of it, this particular law was given,
and those that broke this were doubly guilty, as the Jews observe (m);
once in eating things that died of themselves, or were torn with beasts,
and again by eating the fat of them.

[Leviticus 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">lev 7:25</span></span>

For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an
offering made by fire unto the Lord,.... As oxen, sheep, rams, goats;
meaning not only the fat of those that are offered, but the fat of all
those of the like kind:

even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people; See Gill
on [Lev 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#020) Maimonides (n.md) observes,
that the punishment of cutting off is enjoined for the eating of fat,
because men used to count it delicious, for which reason also God would
honour his sacrifices with it: and he further observes (o), that the fat
of the intestines too much saturates, hinders concoction, generates
gross and frigid blood, hence it is much better it should be burnt than
eaten; and that blood and what dies of itself are of difficult
digestion, and of bad nourishment, wherefore the latter is forbidden in
the [Lev 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#024.md), and the former in [Lev
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#026.md), of the punishment for eating
fat, the same writer (p) observes, he that eats fat the quantity of an
olive, presumptuously, is guilty of cutting off; if ignorantly, he must
bring the fixed sin offering: and elsewhere (q) he says, he that eats
fat is beaten for it; and he eats it a second time, and is beaten for
it; but if he eats it a third time they do not beat him, but put him
into a prison, which is a strait place according to his height, where he
cannot stand upright, nor can he lie down in it; and they give him bread
and water of affliction till his bowels are distressed, and he become
sick, and then they feed him with barley till his belly bursts.

[Leviticus 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">lev 7:26</span></span>

Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood,.... Of any of the above
creatures, or any other, even of any clean creature, and much less of an
unclean one:

whether it be of fowl or of beast; of all sorts and kinds. Jarchi
thinks, the words being thus expressed, the blood of fishes and locusts
is excepted, and so lawful to eat:

in any of your dwellings; this shows that this law is not to be
restrained to creatures slain in sacrifice in the tabernacle, and to the
blood of them, but to be understood of all such as were slain in their
own houses for food, and the blood of them.

[Leviticus 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">lev 7:27</span></span>

Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood,.... The Targum of
Jonathan adds, of any living creature, that is, of any while it is
alive; for the Jews always interpret the law in [Gen
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#004.md) of the member of a living creature
torn off from it, and its flesh with the blood eaten directly:

even that soul shall be cut off from his people; Maimonides (r)
observes, that to some sorts of food cutting off is threatened,
particularly to blood, because of the eager desire of men to eat it in
those times, and because it precipitated them to a certain species of
idolatry; he means that of the Zabians, of which See Gill on [Eze
33:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#025.md) of the true reason of the
prohibition of eating blood under the law, see [Lev
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#010.md), &c.

[Leviticus 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">lev 7:28</span></span>

And the Lord spake unto Moses,.... At the same time the above laws were
delivered; for what follows relates to the sacrifice of the peace
offerings:

saying; as follows.

[Leviticus 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">lev 7:29</span></span>

Speak unto the children of Israel, saying,.... Giving them the further
instructions concerning their peace offerings:

he that offereth the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the Lord;
whether it he for thanksgiving, or as a vow, or a voluntary oblation,
and whether it be of the herd or of the flock, an ox or a cow, a lamb or
a goat:

shall bring his oblation unto the Lord of the sacrifice of his peace
offerings; that is, the unleavened cakes, wafers, and fried cakes, and
unleavened bread, which are called the whole oblation, [Lev
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#010.md).

[Leviticus 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">lev 7:30</span></span>

His own hands shall bring the offerings of the Lord made by fire,....
That is, such parts of the peace offerings as were to be burnt with
fire, as the fat on several parts described in [Lev
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#003.md) the owners of the offerings were
to bring them in the manner as will be presently observed:

the fat with the breast, it shall he bring; the fat to be burnt, and the
breast for the priest and his sons, as in the following verse [Lev
7:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#031.md),

that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the Lord; how
this waving was performed; see Gill on [Exo
29:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#024.md) particularly with respect to
these peace offerings it was thus; if a thank offering, the priest takes
of the bread brought with it one (cake) out of ten, and lays it with the
breast, the shoulder, and the inwards, and waves all upon the hands of
the owners; on which he puts the fat, then the breast and the shoulder
above (i.e. upon the fat), then the two kidneys, and the caul, and the
liver above them; and if there was any bread, he put it over them, and
waved all, putting his hand under the hands of the owner (s).

\(s\) Maimon. Maaseh Hakorbanot, c. 9. sect. 6, 7. so Ben Gersom in loc.

[Leviticus 7:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">lev 7:31</span></span>

And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar,.... Of burnt offering,
even the fat upon the inwards, the two kidneys, the flanks, the caul,
and liver:

but the breast shall be Aaron's and his sons; which being waved before
the Lord for a wave offering, was the Lord's, and so was given to his
priests to eat of, for the service done by them, it being but reasonable
that they that serve at the altar should live of it; and thus, with
other things, a maintenance was provided for the priests and their
families, as ought also to be for Gospel ministers under the present
dispensation.

[Leviticus 7:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">lev 7:32</span></span>

And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave
offering,.... Whether of an ox or a cow, a lamb or a goat:

of the sacrifices of your peace offerings; which were of either of these
creatures; the Targum of Jonathan paraphrases it,"the right arm from the
shoulder to the elbow.''The breast being the seat of wisdom, and the
shoulder of strength, some think denote Christ as the wisdom and power
of God unto his people, his priests, who have all their knowledge and
strength from him, and who bears them on his heart and on his shoulder.

[Leviticus 7:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">lev 7:33</span></span>

He among the sons of Aaron that offereth the blood of the peace
offerings, and the fat,.... Who sprinkled the blood of them upon the
altar round about, and burnt the fat upon it, which were rites enjoined
to be observed, [Lev 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#002.md),

shall have the right shoulder for his part; his particular part and
share, because of his service: Aben Ezra remarks, that the right
shoulder was given to him that sprinkled the blood, and the breast to
all the priests; and Jarchi observes, that he that was fit for
sprinkling the blood, and burning the fat, and went out an unclean
person in the time of sprinkling the blood, or burning the fat, had no
part in the flesh.

[Leviticus 7:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">lev 7:34</span></span>

For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the children
of Israel,.... These two parts were particularly pitched upon and
selected:

from off the sacrifices of their peace offering; the rest being allowed
the owners, besides what were burnt:

and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons, by a
statute for ever from among the children of Israel; as long as the
priesthood lasted, even to the coming of the Messiah, in whom all these
sacrifices would have their accomplishment and their end.

[Leviticus 7:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">lev 7:35</span></span>

This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron,.... Of his being anointed
to the priestly office; this is the part allotted and assigned him for
the execution of it; this is the reward, as Aben Ezra interprets it, of
his faithful performance of it, namely, his having the wave breast and
heave shoulder of the peace offerings, and a cake out of everyone of the
unleavened cakes, together with the leavened bread, besides other
perquisites from other offerings:

and of the anointing of his sons; the successors of him in the priest
hood; the Targum of Jonathan adds, above all their brethren the Levites:

out of the offerings of the Lord made by fire; out of such whose fat on
the several parts of them was burnt with fire, such as the peace
offerings were:

in the day when he presented them to minister unto the Lord in the
priest's office; when they were ordered to be taken out from among the
children of Israel, and to be consecrated to, and invested with, the
priest's office, as they were by Moses, and presented by him unto him as
his priests; at that time the above portion was assigned them, as
follows.

[Leviticus 7:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">lev 7:36</span></span>

Which the Lord commanded to be given them of the children of Israel,....
Whenever they brought their offerings to be offered up by them, such
parts thereof were ordered to be allowed them as theirs:

in the day that he anointed them; or from the day they were anointed of
Moses, by the direction of the Lord, from that time they had a right and
claim to the above things, out of the sacrifices brought, so Aben Ezra:
and this was

by a statute for ever throughout their generations; in all successive
generations, unto the coming of the Messiah, which would put an end to
their priesthood. Thus the Lord provided for the maintenance of his
ministers, till that time came; and since it has been the ordinance of
Christ, that they which preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel,
[Co1 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#013.md).

[Leviticus 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">lev 7:37</span></span>

This is the law of the burnt offering,.... As delivered, [Lev
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#009.md),

of the meat offering; as in [Lev 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#014.md),

and of the sin offering; as in [Lev
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#025.md),

and of the trespass offering; as in [Lev
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#001.md),

and of the consecrations; of Aaron and his sons to the priest's office,
as in [Lev 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#020.md),

and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings; as in this chapter, [Lev
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#011.md) for this is only a recapitulation
of the several laws respecting these things before observed.

[Leviticus 7:38](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">lev 7:38</span></span>

Which the Lord commanded Moses in Mount Sinai,.... Or "by" or "near" (t)
Mount Sinai; for the above laws were not given to Moses when on the
mount, but after the tabernacle was erected, and out of it, as appears
from [Lev 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md) and to which what
follows agrees:

in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their
oblations unto the Lord in the wilderness of Sinai; where they were when
the above laws were delivered to them, and which wilderness had its name
from the mount near to which they now were, and where the tabernacle was
pitched, from whence the Lord spoke; and so the Targum of Jonathan
paraphrases it,"in the tabernacle which they made for him in the
wilderness of Sinai;''there they were ordered to offer their oblations
of every sort, as before directed. It should be observed, that this is
to be understood of the command given in the wilderness to offer
sacrifices, but not of the sacrifices themselves then offered, which
were not done while there; see [Jer
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#022.md).

\(t\) "by the mount"; so Patrick in loc.
