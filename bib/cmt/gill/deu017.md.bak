### [Deuteronomy Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

INTRODUCTION TO DEUTERONOMY 17

This chapter begins with a caution not to sacrifice anything to the Lord
that is blemished or ill favoured, [Deu
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#001.md), an order is given to put to
death men or women guilty of idolatry, where it is clearly proved upon
them, [Deu 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#002.md) and it is directed
that when cases are too hard for inferior judges to determine, they
should be brought to Jerusalem to the priests, Levites, and judges,
which formed the great consistory there, whose sentence was to be
adhered unto on pain of death, [Deu
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#008.md), and rules are given about the
choice of a king, and he is informed what he must not do, and what he
should do, [Deu 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#014.md).

[Deuteronomy 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 17:1</span></span>

Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the Lord thy God any bullock or sheep
wherein is blemish,.... No sacrifice of any sort, whether burnt
offering, sin offering, or peace offering, was to have any blemish in
it; typical of the unblemished and immaculate Lamb of God, who, being
without sin, offered himself without spot to God, and so could take away
the sins of others by the sacrifice of himself; see [Lev
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#018.md),

or any evilfavouredness; any sickness or disease upon it of any sort,
which made it ill favoured to the sight, or disagreeable to the smell,
or however unacceptable for sacrifice:

for that is an abomination to the Lord thy God; every such blemished and
ill favoured sacrifice; see [Mal 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#008.md).

[Deuteronomy 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 17:2</span></span>

If there be found among you, within any of thy gates which the Lord thy
God giveth thee,.... In any of their cities in the land of Canaan:

man or woman that hath wrought wickedness in the sight of the Lord thy
God: as all that is wrought is in the sight of the omniscient God; here
it means not any kind of wickedness, for there is none lives without
committing sin of one sort or another, all which is known to God the
searcher of hearts, but such wickedness as is after described:

in transgressing his covenant; that is, his law, and particularly the
first table of it, which respects divine worship, and which is in the
nature of a marriage contract or covenant; which, as that is
transgressed by adultery committed by either party, so the covenant
between God and Israel was transgressed by idolatry, which is spiritual
adultery, and going a whoring after other gods, as it follows:

[Deuteronomy 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 17:3</span></span>

And hath gone,.... The Targum of Jonathan adds, after the evil
imagination or concupiscence, lusting after other lovers, and forsaking
the true God, and departing from his worship:

and served other gods; strange gods, the idols of the people, other gods
besides the true God; the creature besides the Creator:

and worshipped them; by bowing down before them, praying to them, or
ascribing their mercies and blessings to them, and giving them the glory
of them:

either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven: the two great
luminaries, and the planets, constellations, and stars, any of them;
which kind of idolatry very early obtained, and was in use at this time
among the Heathens, and was an iniquity to be punished by the judge,
[Job 31:26](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#026.md), which sin, though so
strictly forbidden, the people of Israel sometimes fell into, [Kg2
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#003.md).

which I have not commanded: and which is a sufficient reason, in matters
of worship, to avoid and abstain from anything, that God has not
commanded it; for in things of that nature nothing should be done but
what he has ordered, who is a jealous God, and will not suffer any to
take upon them to direct what should be done as a religious service and
duty; and if any are so presumptuous, they must expect it will be
resented; see [Isa 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#012.md) and especially
with respect to the object of worship, as here, and which relate to
things if not forbid expressly, yet tacitly, to do which was an
abomination to the Lord.

[Deuteronomy 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 17:4</span></span>

And it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it, and inquired
diligently,.... A report of this kind was not to be neglected; though it
was not to be concluded upon as certain by hearsay, it was to be looked
into, and the persons that brought it thoroughly examined; so the Targum
of Jonathan,"and inquired the witnesses well,''what proof and evidence
they could give of the fact, who the persons were, when and where, and
in what manner the sin was committed:

and, behold, it be true, and the thing certain; upon examining the
witnesses the case is plain and out of all question:

that such abomination is wrought in Israel; to do it in any country was
abominable, but much more so in the land of Israel, among the professing
people of God, who had the knowledge of the true God, and had had so
many proofs of his deity, his power and providence, as well as received
so many favours and blessings from him, and had such laws and statutes
given them as no other people had.

[Deuteronomy 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 17:5</span></span>

Thou shall bring forth that man or that woman which have committed the
wicked thing,.... Idolatry in any of the above instances: this must be
supposed to be done after he or she have been had before a court of
judicature, and have been tried and found guilty, and sentence passed on
them, then they were to be brought forth to execution:

unto thy gates; the Targum of Jonathan says, unto the gates of your
sanhedrim, or court of judicature; but Jarchi observes, that this is a
mistake of the paraphrase, for he says, we are taught by tradition that
"thy gate" is the gate in which he has served or committed idolatry; and
so says Maimonides (d), they do not stone a man but at the gate where he
served or worshipped; but if the greatest part of the city are Heathens,
they stone him at the door of the sanhedrim; and this is received from
tradition, that "to thy gates" is the gate at which he served, and not
where his judgment is finished:

even that man or that woman; this is repeated, and the woman as well as
the man is expressed, to show that no compassion is to be had on her as
is usual, nor to be spared on account of the weakness and tenderness of
her sex, but she as well as the man must be brought forth and executed
according to her sentence, without any mercy shown; and this is observed
to show the resentment of the divine Majesty, and his indignation at
this sin:

and shalt stone them with stones until they die; of the manner of
stoning men and women; see Gill on [Act
7:58](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#058.md).

\(d\) Hilchot Sanhedrin, c. 15. sect. 2.

[Deuteronomy 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 17:6</span></span>

At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is
worthy of death be put to death,.... The idolater found guilty was to be
stoned; two witnesses were sufficient to prove a fact, if three the
better, but, on the testimony of one, sentence might not be pronounced.
Aben Ezra observes, that some say, if two witnesses contradict two
other, a third turns the scale and determines the matter; and others
say, that two who are wise men will do, and three of others; and because
it is said "at the mouth" of these witnesses, it is concluded, that a
testimony should be verbal and not written; should not be recorded,
neither in pecuniary cases nor in capital ones, but from the mouth of
the witnesses, as it is said "at the mouth", &c. at their mouth, and not
from their handwriting (e):

but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death; so careful
is the Lord of the lives of men, that none should be taken away but upon
full and sufficient evidence, even in cases in which his own glory and
honour is so much concerned.

\(e\) Maimon. Hilchot Eduth, c. 3. sect. 4.

[Deuteronomy 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 17:7</span></span>

The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to
death,.... Of everyone of them, as Aben Ezra; they were to cast the
first stone at him, which would be a further trial and confirmation of
their testimony; for if they readily and without reluctance first began
the stoning of the idolater, it would not only show their zeal for the
honour of the divine Being, but an unconsciousness of guilt in their
testimony, and be an encouragement to others to proceed with safety:

and afterwards the hands of all the people; should be employed in taking
up stones, and casting at him until he was dead:

so thou shall put the evil away from among you; both the evil man and
the evil committed by him, which by this means would be prevented from
spreading, seeing by his death others would be deterred from following
his example; as well as the evil of punishment, which otherwise would
have come upon the nation, had they connived at so gross an iniquity.

[Deuteronomy 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 17:8</span></span>

If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment,.... This is
spoken to inferior judges in cities in the country, who sometimes might
have cases too wonderful and mysterious, as the word signifies, or
secret and hidden, such as were out of their reach and beyond their
capacity, and so be very difficult for them to determine what should be
done:

between blood and blood; that is, whether a man is guilty of shedding
innocent blood or not; when such a case is depending between a person
charged with it and the relatives of the deceased, or between a man
slayer and the avenger of blood, and the question is, whether he may
have the benefit of a city of refuge or not, and there are some
circumstances attending it which make it difficult how to determine:

between plea and plea; of the plaintiff on one side and of the defendant
on the other, and both have so much to say in their own cause, that it
is hard to decide which is in the right and which is in the wrong,
whether in capital or pecuniary cases; it chiefly if not solely respects
civil things in controversy:

and between stroke and stroke; blow or wound which one man received from
another, and for which he commences a suit of law upon it, [Exo
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#018.md) or for assault and battery; and
so Aben Ezra interprets it of blows and bruises; but the Jewish writers
generally interpret it of the plague, or stroke of leprosy; so the
Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem; but the examination of such a case
did not belong to the civil magistrate, but to a priest; nor was such a
person had up to Jerusalem to be searched, but was shut up in a house
until further evidence could be got; and, besides, the signs of the
leprosy are so distinctly given, that at waiting a proper time, there
was seldom or ever any difficulty about determining it:

being matter of controversy within thy gates; or what are matters of
controversy about anything else; for the phrase is general, as Aben Ezra
observes, and takes in everything in which anything difficult might
occur; so Jarchi interprets it of things which the wise men of a city
are divided about; one pronounces a person or thing unclean, another
clean, one condemning and another justifying, and so far rightly; for
this respects not controversies between men, that may be brought into
courts of judicature, but controversies or divisions arising in these
courts upon them, between the judges themselves, they not agreeing in
their opinions:

then shalt thou arise and get thee up into the place which the Lord thy
God shall choose; to Jerusalem, to the great sanhedrim or court of
judicature, to which the inferior judges were to apply themselves, in
matters of moment and difficulty, for instruction, information, and
direction; it being supposed that in such a court such like cases may
have been brought before them, and they were expert and understanding in
them.

[Deuteronomy 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 17:9</span></span>

Thou shalt come unto the priests, the Levites,.... The priests that are
of the tribe of Levi, as the Targum of Jonathan, and so Jarchi; for Aben
Ezra says there are priests that are not of the genealogy of Levi; such
there were indeed in Jeroboam's time, [Kg1
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#031). Maimonides (f.md) observes, that
it is ordered that there should be in the great sanhedrim priests and
Levites, as it is said: "and thou shalt come unto the priests, and the
judge that shall be in those days, and inquire"; judge is here put for
judges, of which the great court consisted, being priests, Levites, and
Israelites; See Gill on [Deu 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#018.md),
though others think that only a single person is meant, such as Othniel,
Ehud, Gideon, Samson, &c. but then as there was not always such an one
in being, I should rather think that the judge here, if a single person,
is the president or prince of the great sanhedrim, who succeeded Moses,
and sat in his place; and of him and his court, the priests, and Levites
and Israelites that composed it, inquiry was to be made:

and they shall show thee the sentence of judgment; give their judgment
in the difficult case proposed, and declare what is right to be done,
and what sentence is to be pronounced.

\(f\) Hilchot Sanhedrin, c. 2. sect. 2.

[Deuteronomy 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 17:10</span></span>

And thou shalt do according to the sentence which they of that place
which the Lord shall choose shall show thee,.... The judges of the
inferior courts were to return and proceed on the difficult case
according to the judgment of the great court at Jerusalem, and follow
the directions and instructions they should give them:

and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform thee; not
only observe and take notice of what they say, but put it in practice,
and not in some things and some circumstances only, but in all and
everything they should give them information about relating to the case
in question.

[Deuteronomy 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 17:11</span></span>

According to the sentence of the law which they shall teach thee,....
For they were not to make any new law, but to teach the law of God, and
so far as their sense and opinion of things agreed with that law they
were to be regarded:

and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee, thou shalt do;
what were law and justice, what were fit and right to be done, according
to the will of God, which they should declare unto them, that was
carefully to be done by them:

thou shalt not decline from the sentence they shall show thee, to the
right hand nor to the left; by setting up after, all their own judgments
against theirs to whom they had applied for information and direction,
which to have done would have been very insolent and affronting; they
were not to depart from the determination they made of the case, on
pretence of knowing better, nor even in any minute circumstance to
deviate from it, but strictly and closely to keep unto it; though not to
follow them so implicitly as to receive from them and embrace things the
most absurd and unreasonable, as Jarchi suggests; who says, that their
sense was to be abided by, even if they should say that the right hand
is the left, and the left hand the right.

[Deuteronomy 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 17:12</span></span>

The judge of the country court that makes his application to that at
Jerusalem for information and direction; if, after all, he is conceited
in his own opinion, and rejects theirs, and is obstinate, and will not
be guided and directed, but will take his own way, and pursue his own
sense of things, and act according to that:

and will not hearken to the priest that standeth to minister there
before the Lord thy God; the priests of the tribe of Levi, of whom the
court generally consisted, [Deu 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#009.md),
priest for priests; though some think the high priest is meant, to whom
the character very well agrees; but he was not always at the head of the
sanhedrim, nor indeed a member of it, unless he had the proper
qualifications; see [Deu 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#018.md).

or unto the judge; or judges; See Gill on [Deu
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#009). L'Empereur (g.md) thinks, that the
supreme senate, or grand sanhedrim, was twofold, according to the
diversity of ecclesiastic and political matters; since where it treats
of the supreme senators, or chief persons in the court, the priest is
manifestly distinguished from the judge (i.e. priests or judges); now
the man that has asked advice of them, and will not be directed by it,
but takes his own way, this being so great a contempt of, and insult
upon, the great senate of the nation:

even that man shall die; and this was by strangling, for so the
rebellious older, as such an one is called, was to die according to the
Misnah (h); and it is said (i), that the death spoken of in the law
absolutely (without specifying what kind of death) is strangling:

and thou shall put away the evil from Israel; the evil man that is
rebellious against the supreme legislature of the nation, and the evil
of contumacy he is guilty of, deterring others from it by his death.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 17:13</span></span>

And all the people shall hear, and fear,.... All the people of Israel in
their own cities, and particularly the judges in those cities; they
shall hear of what is done to the obstinate and disobedient elder, and
shall be afraid to commit the like offence, lest they should come into
the same punishment:

and do no more presumptuously; after his example; hence, Jarchi says,
they wait till the feast comes, and then put him to death; and so it is
said (k), they bring him up to the great sanhedrim which is at
Jerusalem, and there keep him until the feast (the next feast), and put
him to death at the feast, as it is said:

all the people shall hear, and fear.

[Deuteronomy 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 17:14</span></span>

When thou art come unto the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee,....
The land of Canaan:

and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein; be entirely in the
possession of it, and settled in it; it seems to denote some time of
continuance in it, as it was, before they thought of setting a king over
them, about which are the following instructions:

and shalt say, I will set a king over me, like as all the nations that
are round about me; which was what would and did lead them to such a
thought and resolution; observing that the neighbouring nations had
kings over them, they were desirous of being like them as to the form of
their civil government, and have a king as they had.

[Deuteronomy 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 17:15</span></span>

Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee whom the Lord thy God
shall choose,.... The Jews take this to be a command to set a king over
them: whereas it is only a permission in case they should desire and
determine on having one, as God foresaw they would; and this with a
limitation and restriction to appoint none but whom God should choose,
and which was their duty and interest to attend unto; for none could
choose better for them, and was what he had a right unto, and it became
them to submit to it, since he was their King in a civil and special
sense, and another was only his viceregent; accordingly we find, when
they expressed their desire to have a king in the time of Samuel, and it
was granted, though not without some resentment, the Lord chose their
first king for them, Saul, and, after him, David, and even Solomon,
David's son; and though, in later times, they appointed kings without
consulting him, it is complained of, [Hos
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#004.md) hence this clause is prefaced in
the Targum of Jonathan,

"ye shall seek instruction from the Lord, and after set him king,
&c.''which was to be done by the mouth of a prophet, or by Urim, as Aben
Ezra observes:

one from among thy brethren shall thou set king over thee: that is, one
of their own nation, an Israelite, a brother both by nation and
religion:

thou mayest not set a stranger over thee that is not thy brother; one of
another nation, that is not of the family of Israel, as Aben Ezra notes,
even not an Edomite, though called sometimes their brother; and Herod,
who was an Idumean, was set up, not by them, but by the Romans; now in
this their king was a type of the King Messiah, of whom it is said,
"their nobles shall be of themselves", [Jer
30:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#021.md).

[Deuteronomy 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 17:16</span></span>

But he shall not multiply horses to himself,.... That he might not put
his trust and confidence in outward things, as some are apt to trust in
horses and chariots; and that he might not tyrannise over and distress
his subjects by keeping a number of horses and chariots as a standing
army, and chiefly for a reason that follows; he was to have no more than
for his own chariot, so Jarchi, and so the Misnah (g) and Maimonides
(h); the Targum of Jonathan restrains it to two:

nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should
multiply horses; which was a country that abounded with them, and
therefore he was not to encourage, and much less oblige his subjects to
travel thither or trade with that people for the sake of increasing his
stock of horses, [Isa 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#001.md).

forasmuch as the Lord hath said unto you, ye shall henceforth return no
more that way; not that going into Egypt on any account whatsoever was
forbidden, as for trade and merchandise in other things, or for shelter
and safety, for which some good men fled thither; but for outward help
and assistance against enemies, and for horses on that account, and
particularly in order to dwell there, from which the Jews in the times
of Jeremiah were dissuaded by him, and threatened by the Lord with
destruction, in case they should, [Jer
42:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#015.md). When the Lord said this is not
certain; it may be when they proposed to make a captain, and return unto
Egypt; or he said this in his providence, this was the language of it
ever since they came out of it, or however this he now said; see [Deu
28:68](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#068.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 17:17</span></span>

Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not
away,.... From attending to the duty of his office, the care and
government of his people, and from serious religion; and particularly
from the worship of the true God, as the heart of Solomon was turned
away from it by his numerous idolatrous wives, [Kg1
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#003.md), it is a common notion of the
Jews that a king might have eighteen wives, and no more (k): neither
shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold; he might increase
his wealth, but not greatly, lest his heart should be lifted up with
pride by it, and lest his subjects should be oppressed and burdened with
taxes for that purpose; or he, being possessed of so much, should make
use of it to enslave them, and especially should be so elated with it as
to deny God, and despise his providence, and disobey his laws; see [Pro
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#009). The Jews generally say (l.md), that
he ought not to multiply more than what will pay the stipends or wages
of his servants, and only for the treasury of the house of the Lord, and
for the necessity of the congregation (or commonwealth), and for their
wars; but not for himself, and his own treasury.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 17:18</span></span>

And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom,....
When he is settled on it, and is even amidst all the pomp and glory of
it: that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book; which copy the
Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions interpret of this book of
Deuteronomy, which is a summary abstract and repetition of the various
laws of God to the people of Israel; though the Jewish writers commonly
understand it of the whole Pentateuch, the five books of Moses; which
perhaps may be enlarging it too much, as it would be reducing it to too
little to restrain it to this law concerning kings, as the Targum of
Jonathan. The word "Mishneh", rendered "copy", signifies "double"; hence
some take it to mean a double exemplar or copy of the law he was obliged
to write out, whereby it would be the more imprinted on his mind, and he
would be furnished with it for his use at home and abroad, as the Jewish
writers observe; so Jarchi by the copy understands two books of the law,
one to be left in his treasury, the other to go out and in with him. The
same is said in the Talmud (m), and with which Maimonides (n) agrees,
whose words are,"at the time a king sits on the throne of his kingdom,
he writes for himself a book of the law, besides what his fathers left
him; and he copies it out of the book of the court by the order of the
sanhedrim of seventy one; if his fathers have left him none, or it is
lost, he writes two books of the law, one he leaves in the house of his
treasures, which he is commanded, as everyone of Israel is, and the
second never departs from him;''but one may seem sufficient on all
occasions, and for all purposes; and this was to be wrote out of that
which is before the priests and Levites; the original copy of it, which
was deposited in the side of the ark; see [Deu
31:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#026.md).

And it shall be with him,.... Always, when at home or abroad, sitting on
his throne or lying down, or wherever he went, unless in such places
where it was not proper to read it, as the Jews observe (o): and he
shall read therein all the days of his life; every day of his life;
meditate on it night and day, as a good man does, that he might be well
versed in it, and know how to govern his people according to it:

that he may learn to, fear the Lord his God; to serve and worship him
both internally and externally, he having the fear of God always before
his eyes, and on his heart, which the holy law of God directs to and
instructs in:

to keep all the words of this law, and these statutes, to do them; not
only such as concerned him as a king, but all others that concerned him
as a man, a creature subject to the Lord, and as an Israelite belonging
to the church and commonwealth of Israel, and so includes all laws,
moral, ceremonial, and judicial.

[Deuteronomy 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">deu 17:20</span></span>

That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren,.... On account of
his office, the dignity of it, considering that he was subject to the
law of God, and accountable to the Lord for all his actions:

and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand or to
the left; not in the least deviate from the law of God in the whole of
his conduct, and particularly in the exercise of his kingly office:

to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom; ruling well
according to the laws of God being the way to rule long:

he and his children in the midst of Israel; this shows, as Jarchi
observes, that if his son was fit for the kingdom, he was to be
preferred to any other man; for though it was elective, yet to be
continued in the same family, provided they walked in the ways of the
Lord, and observed his laws.
