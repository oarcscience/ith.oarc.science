[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md)

INTRODUCTION TO JOSHUA 13

In this chapter Joshua is informed by the Lord, or put in mind, that
part of the land of Canaan remained unconquered, and which it was; and
is directed to divide the whole land among the nine tribes, and the half
tribe of Manasseh, [Jos 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#001.md); and
since the two tribes of Reuben and Gad, and the other half tribe of
Manasseh, had received their inheritance on the other side Jordan, [Jos
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#008.md); that is described in general,
[Jos 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#009.md); and, then the particular
portion of Reuben, [Jos 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#015.md); and of
Gad, [Jos 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#024.md); and of the half tribe
of Manasseh, [Jos 13:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#029.md).

[Joshua 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 13:1</span></span>

Now Joshua was old, and stricken in years,.... How old he was cannot be
said precisely, but it is very probable he was now about an hundred
years of age, for he lived to be an hundred ten; and the land of Canaan
was seven years in dividing, as the Jews generally say, and it seems as
if he did not live long after that:

and the Lord said unto him: either spoke to him out of the tabernacle,
or appeared to him in a dream or vision:

thou art old, and stricken in years, and there remaineth yet very much
land to be possessed: that is, very much of the land of Canaan, which
God had promised to Abraham, yet remained unconquered by Joshua, and
unpossessed by the children of Israel; and the old age of Joshua is
observed, to intimate to him that through it, and the infirmities of it,
he was unable to go out to war, and to finish this work, which must be
left to be done by others hereafter; and that he should with all
expedition set about another work he was capable of doing, before he
died, which was the division of the land among the tribes of Israel.

[Joshua 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 13:2</span></span>

This is the land that yet remaineth,.... Unconquered and not enjoyed,
namely, what is after described; and this account is given for Joshua's
information, that he might know what to divide, and for the people of
Israel's sake, that they might know what they had a right to a claim
upon; what they should endeavour to possess themselves of, and what the
Lord would deliver into their hands, provided they were obedient to his
will, for, because they were not, hence many of these places never came
into their possession, though divided to them by lot:

all the borders of the Philistines; whose country bordered and lay upon
the shores of the Mediterranean sea, in the southwest of the land of
Canaan:

and all Geshuri; the principal city belonging to it is said to be in
Syria, [Sa2 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#008.md); and had a king over
it in the times of David, [Sa2 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#003.md);
and seems never to have come into the hands of the Israelites.

[Joshua 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 13:3</span></span>

From Sihor, which is before Egypt,.... Which Jarchi and Kimchi interpret
of the river Nile, and so that river is called, [Jer
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#018.md); it seems to have this name from
the waters of it being black and turbid; and hence it was called by the
Greeks "Melas"; and by the Latins "Melo"; though it is thought, that not
properly the river itself is here meant, which did not reach to the
borders of Palestine, but a branch of it, a rivulet from it, for so a
traveller (a) writes,"in a journey of about five days from Gaza towards
Egypt, the hithermost arm of the Nile is received by the sea, and is
commonly called Carabus?"

even unto the borders of Ekron northward: that is, from the southwest of
Palestine, near to which was the river Nile, to the northern part of it,
where stood the principality of Ekron, one of the five which belonged to
the Philistines:

which is counted to the Canaanite; which was reckoned as belonging to
the posterity of Canaan, though the Philistines got possession of it,
who descended from Mizraim; and indeed it was only accounted as
belonging to Canaan and his sons; of right, and according to the grant
of God, it belonged to the seed of Abraham:

five lords of the Philistines; who had not kings, as other countries and
cities in the land of Canaan had, and their cities were called
lordships, principalities, and not kingdoms, and are as follow:

the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites,

and the Ekronites: so called from Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and
Ekron, the cities they were in possession of:

also the Avites; it is not certain whether these were a distinct
principality from the other five, or a people dispersed among them;
which seems most likely, since those were the original inhabitants, but
were driven out or destroyed by the Philistines, though it seems some
remained and dwelt among them; see [Deu
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#023.md).

[Joshua 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 13:4</span></span>

From the south, all the land of the Canaanites,.... That is, of those
Canaanites who were particularly so called, in distinction from those of
the other nations or tribes, and who dwelt in several parts of the land,
some in the east and others in the west, see [Jos
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#003.md); and, as it seems here, some in
the south: now on the side of the south, as Kimchi interprets it, all
the land of the Canaanites was left, that is, remained unconquered and
not possessed:

and Mearah that is beside the Sidonians; the inhabitants of Sidon, and
parts adjacent: what this place was, which belonged to the Sidonians,
for so it may better be rendered, is not certain; some take it to be a
cave belonging to them: Sandys (b) speaks of a number of caves cut out
of the rock in those parts, called the caves of the Sidonians, and
afterwards the caves of Tyre; so it is interpreted by the Targum, and in
the Syriac and Arabic versions others take it to be the river Magoras,
Pliny (c) makes mention of as on the borders of Lebanon near Zidon and
Berytus: mention is made of the waters of Mearah along with the waters
of Tiberias in Jewish writings (d); but rather something of more
importance than a cave or a river is meant; most likely a tract of land
near Sidon, and which belonged to it, and reached

unto Aphek, to the borders of the Amorites; of this place; see Gill on
[Jos 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#018.md).

And the land of the Giblites,.... This was another country that remained
unconquered; the Greeks call it Byblus, and near to which Pliny (e)
speaks of a place called Gabale, and is now called Gibyle; it is (f)
said to be"pleasantly situated by the seaside, and at present it
contains but a little extent of ground, but yet more than enough for the
small number of its inhabitants:''it was in greater splendour, and its
inhabitants of more fame, in the times of Ezekiel, [Eze
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#009.md),

and all Lebanon toward the sunrising; or east of the land; all that
inhabited that mountain remained unconquered, though the conquest was
carried as far as the borders thereof:

from Baalgad, under Mount Hermon; of which see [Jos
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#017.md);

unto the entering into Hamath: which was the north border of the land;
see [Num 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#008.md).

[Joshua 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 13:6</span></span>

All the inhabitants of the hill country,.... Not in Judea, but in and
about Lebanon, as follows:

from Lebanon unto Misrephothmaim; of which see [Jos
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#008.md),

and all the Sidonians; the inhabitants of the ancient city of Sidon, and
the villages and lands belonging to it: these remained unconquered, and
never were possessed by the Israelites:

them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: which, though
it may have a special respect unto the Sidonians, with whom the clause
is closely connected, yet may include all the above lands unconquered,
out of which, as well as Sidon, the Lord promises to drive the
inhabitants, to make way for the children of Israel; that is, on
condition of their obedience, for it appears that not only the
Sidonians, but many others, even the chief, and most of those mentioned,
were never possessed by them:

only divide thou it by lot unto the Israelites for an inheritance; that
is, the whole land, as Abarbinel rightly remarks, both what was subdued
and what was not; that was the business, and all the business, Joshua
had now to do; he was not to be employed in making any further
conquests, but leave them to others, and apply himself to the division
of the land, by lot, to the tribes that as yet had no portion assigned
them:

as I have commanded thee; now, at this time.

[Joshua 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 13:7</span></span>

Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance,.... Having the
command and authority of God for it, he was to set about it at once,
with all diligence and application:

unto the nine tribes: of Judah, Simeon, Benjamin, Dan, Ephraim, Zebulun,
Issachar, Asher, and Naphtali, in which order they are placed, when the
Lord gave to Moses the names of the men that should divide the land
under Eleazar and Joshua, [Num 34:16](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#016.md),

and the half tribe of Manasseh; that half which had no inheritance on
the other side Jordan, and for which a prince of the children of Joseph
was appointed to divide, [Num 34:23](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#023.md).

[Joshua 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jos 13:8</span></span>

With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their
inheritance,.... That is, along with the half tribe of Manasseh, but not
with that half of it before mentioned, who was to haven division of a
part with the nine tribes, but with the other half of the tribe settled
beyond Jordan; with them the tribes of Reuben and Gad had received their
portion at their own request, and so were to have no share in the
present distribution:

which Moses gave them beyond Jordan eastward; at their desire, [Num
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#001.md), and upon certain conditions to
be performed by them, [Num 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#020.md),

even as Moses the servant of the Lord gave them; this character of
Moses, as the "servant of the Lord", seems to be observed to show that
he gave the said tribes their inheritance: according to the will of God,
and in obedience to it: here end the words of the Lord to Joshua, and
next follows an account of the land given to the two tribes and a half
described by the writer of this book.

[Joshua 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 13:9</span></span>

From Aroer, that is on the bank of the river Arnon,.... A city belonging
to Moab, from whence the description begins, the river Arnon, on which
it was situated, being the border between Moab and the Amorites, [Num
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#013.md),

and the city that is in the midst of the river; or "even the city";
meaning the same city of Aroer, it lying both on the bank of it, and in
the middle of it, or it was a double city, as may seem from [Isa
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#002.md); and so differently situated at
that river:

and all the plains of Medeba unto Dibon; of these two places, see [Num
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#030.md); between them lay a plain, which
some take to be the plain of Moab; but it rather seems to be a plain
that was between these two places, and, according to [Jos
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#017.md), Dibon itself was in a plain.

[Joshua 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 13:10</span></span>

And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in
Heshbon,.... A city he took from the Moabites, and made it his royal
seat, [Num 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#026.md),

unto the border of the children of Ammon; which was the river Jabbok,
[Deu 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#016.md).

[Joshua 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jos 13:11</span></span>

And Gilead,.... The land of Gilead, which was part of the kingdom of Og,
half of which was given to Reuben, and the other half to Gad:

and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites; of which see [Deu
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#014.md),

and all Mount Hermon; called also Sirion, Shenir, and Sion, [Deu
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#009.md),

and all Bashan unto Salcah; another part of the dominions of Og, [Deu
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#010.md).

[Joshua 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jos 13:12</span></span>

All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in
Edrei,.... See Gill on [Jos 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#004.md),

who remained of the remnant of the giants; was descended from those that
remained in Ashtaroth, after the rest were cut off by Chedorlaomer, [Gen
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#005.md); called there the Rephaim, as
here:

for these did Moses smite, and cast them out: that is, not only the
giants, but the inhabitants of the above kingdom, the greatest part of
them; for the Geshurites and the Maachathites are excepted in [Jos
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#013.md).

[Joshua 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jos 13:13</span></span>

Nevertheless, the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites, nor
the Maachathites,.... Neither in the times of Moses, nor in the times of
Joshua:

but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until
this day: in full possession of their cities unmolested; yea, in later
times they became separate and distinct kingdoms; for we read both of
the king of Geshur, and of the king of Maachah, [Sa2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#003.md).

[Joshua 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 13:14</span></span>

Only unto the tribe of Levi he gave none inheritance,.... Neither the
Lord, nor Moses by his order, nor did he appoint any inheritance for
them, either beyond Jordan, or on this side it, for the Lord was to be
their inheritance, [Num 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#020.md);

the sacrifices of the Lord God of Israel made by fire are their
inheritance, as he said unto them; [Deu
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#001.md); and which are put for the whole
of what was granted to them for their subsistence, as tithes,
firstfruits, &c.

[Joshua 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jos 13:15</span></span>

And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben inheritance
according to their families. According to the number of them, and
sufficient for them.

[Joshua 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jos 13:16</span></span>

And their coast was from Aroer that is on the bank of the river
Arnon,.... As the country of Sihon is described, [Jos
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#009.md); from whence it appears that it
was his country which was given to Reuben, though not all of it:

and the city that is in the midst of the river; See Gill on [Jos
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#009.md),

and all the plain by Medeba; which reached unto Dibon, [Jos
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#009.md).

[Joshua 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jos 13:17</span></span>

Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the plain,.... Which was by
Medeba, and reached to Dibon:

Dibon, and Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon; Dibon was rebuilt by Gad,
though it belonged to Reuben, and perhaps was inhabited by both, being
on the borders of each; and Bamothbaal signifies the high places of
Baal; see [Num 22:41](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#041.md); perhaps this is
the same with Bamoth in the valley, [Num
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#020.md); and Bethbaalmeon is the same
with Baalmeon in [Num 32:38](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#038.md); where it
is highly probable was a temple of Baal, since both "beth" signifies an
house, and "meon" an habitation.

[Joshua 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jos 13:18</span></span>

And Jahazah,.... Called Jahaz, [Num
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#023.md), where the battle was fought
between Sihon and Israel:

and Kedemoth; near to which was a wilderness, which took its name from
it, from whence Moses sent messengers with words of peace to Sihon, [Deu
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#026.md),

and Mephaath; thought to be the Maipha of Ptolemy (f); here Jerom says
(g), in his time was a garrison of Roman soldiers, because of the desert
that was near. It was a city, with its suburbs, given to the Levites, as
were the two preceding, [Jos 21:36](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#036.md);
Adrichomius (h) takes it to be the same with Malle, which, Josephus
says, (i) was called the city of the strangers.

[Joshua 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jos 13:19</span></span>

And Kirjathaim,.... Of which See Gill on [Num
32:37](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#037.md),

and Sibmah; of which See Gill on [Num
32:3](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#003.md) and See Gill on [Num
32:38](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#038.md),

and Zarethshahar, in the mount of the valley; which was built on one of
the mountains that looked over the valley of Moab, as did Nebo, Pisgah,
Abarim; perhaps it is the same place Josephus (k) calls Zara, to which
he joins the valley of the Cilicians, and mentions it along with
Heshbon, Medeba, and other cities of Moab; according to Adrichomius (l),
it was in the mount of the valley of Bethpeor, which next follows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jos 13:20</span></span>

And Bethpeor,.... So called from Peor, the idol of the Moabites, and
where very likely there had been a temple built to the honour of it;
over against this place was a valley, where Israel abode some time, [Deu
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#029.md),

and Ashdodpisgah; of which see [Deu
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#017.md),

and Bethjeshimoth; of which see [Num
33:49](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#049.md).

[Joshua 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jos 13:21</span></span>

And all the cities of the plain,.... In the champaign country, as well
as those in the mountainous part:

and all the kingdom of Sihon; or, as Masius renders the words, "which
all had been the kingdom of Sihon"; for the whole kingdom of Sihon was
not given to Reuben, only a part of it, and the rest to Gad, as in [Jos
13:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#027.md),

king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon; as in [Jos
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#010.md),

whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur,

and Hur, and Reba; not at the same time that Sihon was smitten by him,
but afterwards in a war with Midian, [Num
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#008.md); where their names are given as
here; and there they are called kings of Midian, petty kings, and, as it
seems by what follows, were subject to Sihon, and therefore are here
mentioned:

which were dukes of Sihon dwelling in the country; for Midian, as Kimchi
supposes, and not without reason, was under the government of Sihon, and
these were his nobles, though they dwelt in the land of Midian.

[Joshua 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jos 13:22</span></span>

Balaam also, the son of Beor the soothsayer, did the children of Israel
slay with the sword,.... At the same time that the princes of Midian
were slain, and which is also observed; see Gill on [Num
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#008.md). Kimchi supposes that he returned
to Midian, on hearing that the counsel he gave to them, to ensnare
Israel with their daughters, had taken effect, in order to receive his
wages, and so received his righteous doom and just reward; it is
commonly said by the Jews (m), that he was slain by Phinehas:

among them that were slain by them; among the above princes, and the
common soldiers, of which there was a great slaughter; even all the
males of Midian were slain, [Num 31:7](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#007.md).

[Joshua 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jos 13:23</span></span>

And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the border
thereof,.... As their border eastward was Aroer on the river Arnon, so
their border westward was the river Jordan:

this was the inheritance of the children of Reuben, after their
families, the cities and the villages thereof; which Moses gave them on
the other side Jordan; and next follow an account of the inheritance of
the tribe of Gad in those parts.

[Joshua 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jos 13:24</span></span>

And Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad,.... On the other side
Jordan, as he did to Reuben:

even unto the children of Gad, according to their families: according to
the number and largeness of them, dividing to each their part and
portion.

[Joshua 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jos 13:25</span></span>

And their coast was Jazer,.... Their southern coast; of Jazer, see [Num
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#032.md); where it is called Jaazer, and
is mentioned in [Isa 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#008.md); and in [Jer
48:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#032.md), where it is spoken of as a city
of Moab, as it was in the days of those prophets:

and all the cities of Gilead; which lay in those parts, for the whole
was not given to this tribe, half of Gilead was given to the half tribe
of Manasseh, [Jos 13:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#031.md),

and half the land of the children of Ammon; not what then belonged to
them, but what had been taken from them by the Amorites; and which
Israel taking from them, had a right to retain, though they were forbid
meddling with any of their land in present possession; see [Deu
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#019.md) [Jdg
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#013.md),

unto Aroer that is before Rabbath; Aroer was a city of Moab, situated on
the river Arnon, [Jos 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#009.md); and stood
over against Rabbath, a city of the Amorites, since called Philadelphia,
the same that Joab took, [Sa2 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#026.md);
though Reland thinks (n), that according to the situation of these
cities another Aroer must be here meant, and which belonged to the
Amorites.

And from Heshbon unto Ramathmizpeh, and Betonim,.... This was their
coast from the south to the north, and so describes their eastern
border, which reached from Heshbon, given to the tribe of Reuben, [Jos
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#007.md); to these places mentioned;
Ramathmizpeh, the same with Ramothgilead, which Jerom (o) says was a
village in his time, and lay two miles from Philadelphia or Rabbath
before mentioned, to the east; it should be to the west; of Betonim we
nowhere else read, it seems to have been near to Ramath:

and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir; the former of these was the
place where the angels met Jacob, and who gave it the name from thence;
and in later times a city of this name was built there, and was near the
river Jabbok, [Gen 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#002.md); Debir is
different from that in the tribe of Judah, [Jos
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#015.md); in the Septuagint version here
it is called Daibon, perhaps the same with Dibon, the tribe of Gad
rebuilt, and is called Dibongad, [Num
32:34](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#034.md); unless Lidbar here should be
the same with Lodebar in Gilead, [Sa2
17:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#027.md).

And in the valley, Betharam,.... The same with Bethharan; see Gill on
[Num 32:36](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#036.md),

and Bethnimrah; sometimes called Nimrah, [Num
32:3](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#003.md); near to which were some waters,
called the waters of Nimrim, [Isa
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#006); It was in Jerom's (p.md) time a
large village; it seems to have its name from leopards, which perhaps
had their haunts hereabout:

and Succoth: the place where Jacob pitched his tent after he had passed
over Jabbok; it is called in the Jerusalem Talmud (q) Thaarabah:

and Zaphon; which in the same Talmud is Amatho or Amathus, which Jerom
says (r) is a village beyond Jordan, twenty one miles from Pella to the
south, though he places it in the tribe of Reuben:

the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon; which was not given to
the tribe of Reuben, [Jos 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#021.md),

Jordan and his border; that is, the cities which were near it, as
Kimchi; or that were upon the bank of it, as Jarchi:

even unto the edge of the sea of Chinnereth; the same with the lake of
Gennesaret, [Luk 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#001.md),

on the other side Jordan eastward; the other from that in which the
inheritance of Gad lay, which was beyond Jordan, from the land of
Canaan.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jos 13:28</span></span>

This is the inheritance of the children of Gad, after their
families,.... As described in [Jos
13:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#027.md),

the cities and their villages; the cities given them, some of which are
mentioned by name, and the villages adjacent and belonging to them were
included in them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jos 13:29</span></span>

And Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh,.... Whether
at their request or of himself, there being land enough for them, and
the two tribes of Gad and Reuben, is not certain:

and this is the possession of the half tribe of Manasseh, by their
families; which is after related and described.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jos 13:30</span></span>

And their coast was from Mahanaim,.... A place in the tribe of Gad, [Jos
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#026.md); which was the boundary of the
half tribe that way:

all Bashan; so famous for its oxen, and for pasturage for them, and for
its oaks, called by Josephus Batanea:

all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan; which, besides Bashan, took in the
kingdom of Argob or Trachonitis, half the land of Gilead, all which was
possessed by the half tribe of Manasseh: see [Deu
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#013.md),

and all the towns of, Jair which are in Bashan, threescore cities; of
Jair, and his relation to Manasseh, and of his taking these cities, and
the number of them, see [Num 33:41](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#041.md).

[Joshua 13:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jos 13:31</span></span>

And half Gilead,.... The other half not given to the Gadites, who had
that half of it which Sihon possessed, and the tribe of Manasseh that
half of it which Og possessed, see [Deu
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#012.md),

and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan; which
are particularly mentioned, because royal cities, [Jos
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#010.md); see [Deu
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#004.md),

were pertaining unto the children of Machir the son of Manasseh; and who
was his only son; however, to his posterity only was this inheritance
given, though not to them all:

even to one half of the children of Machir, by their families; which
seems to confirm it that Manasseh had no other son, since his whole
posterity, both the half tribe on the other side, as well as that in the
land of Canaan, were denominated from him; though he seems to have had
another son, who perhaps died without issue, [Ch1
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#014.md).

[Joshua 13:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jos 13:32</span></span>

These are the countries which Moses did distribute for inheritance in
the plains of Moab,.... Which is particularly described, that each might
know their proper portion:

on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastward; of the land of Canaan; of
Jordan by Jericho; see Gill on [Num
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#001.md).

[Joshua 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jos 13:33</span></span>

But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance,.... Neither
on the other side Jordan, nor did he order them any in Canaan; but
expressly declared they were to have no part in the division of it,
though they were his own tribe; which shows him to be a disinterested
man, that he faithfully observed the orders and instructions the Lord
gave him:

the Lord God of Israel was their inheritance, as he said unto them; what
was given to the Lord out of the sacrifices, and the tithes, and
firstfruits, that were theirs; see [Num
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#020.md).
