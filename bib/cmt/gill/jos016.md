INTRODUCTION TO JOSHUA 16

This chapter gives us an account of the lot of the children of Joseph,
Ephraim, and the half tribe of Manasseh, one half having settled on the
other side Jordan; and first the borders of the whole lot in general are
given, [Jos 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#001.md); and then the borders
of the tribe of Ephraim in particular, [Jos
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#004.md); and it is observed, that this
tribe had besides separate cities among the children of Manasseh, and
that there were some Canaanites, particularly in Gezer, not driven out
by the Ephraimites, [Jos 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#009.md).

[Joshua 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 16:1</span></span>

And the lot of the children of Joseph fell,.... Or, "went out" (a); of
the pot or urn, this being the next lot that was drawn to that of Judah,
the government being Judah's, and the birthright Joseph's, [Ch1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#002.md); and by his children are here
meant the tribe of Ephraim, and the tribe of Manasseh: or the line and
border according to the lot went forth

from Jordan by Jericho unto the water of Jericho on the east; by which
it appears, that this was the southern border of the lot; for the tribe
of Benjamin, in which Jericho was, lay between Judah and Ephraim, and
the border began at Jordan, where it flowed near Jericho, and proceeded
to a water which belonged to that city, and is generally thought to be
the waters Elisha healed, [Kg2 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#019.md),

to the wilderness that goeth up throughout Mount Bethel; this was the
wilderness of Bethaven, [Jos 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#012.md);
Jarchi interprets it of the border that went up through Mount Bethel;
which is true, and so might the wilderness also, for which the Targum is
express; mention is made of a mountain on the east of Bethel, [Gen
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#008.md).

[Joshua 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 16:2</span></span>

And goeth out from Bethel to Luz,.... For though these two places in
time became one, yet they were originally distinct. Bethel, at which
Jacob stopped, and who gave it its name, was a field adjacent to the
city of Luz, [Gen 38:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#011.md); and therefore
with propriety may be, as they here are, distinguished:

and passeth along unto the borders Archi to Ataroth; or to Archiataroth;
these two words being the name of one and the same place, and to be
joined as they are, in the Greek version, and others; and is the same
with Atarothaddar, [Jos 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#005.md). Ataroth
was its proper name, but it had these additional epithets to distinguish
it from another Ataroth; see [Jos
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#007); Jerom (b.md) makes mention of
Atharoth by Ramma, in the tribe of Joseph, and of another in the tribe
of Ephraim, now a village at the north of Sebaste, or Samaria, four
miles from it, called Atharus; the former is here meant.

[Joshua 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 16:3</span></span>

And goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti,.... This place is now
unknown, though no doubt well known to the sons of Joseph, when this lot
fell to them, and its border was described:

unto the coast of Bethhoron the nether: so called to distinguish it from
Bethhoron the upper, [Jos 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#005.md); this
was about twelve miles from Jerusalem; See Gill on [Jos
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#010.md); and to Gezer: which was about a
day's journey from Bethhoron, as appears from the passages in the
Apocrypha:"39 So Nicanor went out of Jerusalem, and pitched his tents in
Bethhoron, where an host out of Syria met him. 40 But Judas pitched in
Adasa with three thousand men, and there he prayed, saying, ... 45 Then
they pursued after them a day's journey, from Adasa unto Gazera,
sounding an alarm after them with their trumpets.'' (1 Maccabees 7)Jerom
(c) says in his time it was a village called Gazara, four miles from
Nicopolis, or Emmaus. It is the same with Gadara, as it is sometimes
called by Josephus, who says (d), the tribe of Ephraim took in the land
from the river Jordan to Gadara; this was a royal city; see [Jos
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#033.md),

and the outgoings thereof are at the sea: the Mediterranean sea.

\(c\) De loc. Heb. fol. 92. A. (d) Antiqu. l. 5. c. 1. sect. 22.

[Joshua 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 16:4</span></span>

So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance.
As it fell to them by the lot; by Manasseh is meant the half tribe of
Manasseh, one half of that tribe having been settled by Moses on the
other side Jordan; and next follows an account of the borders of the
inheritance of Ephraim in particular, as that of the half tribe of
Manasseh is given in [Jos 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#001.md).

[Joshua 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 16:5</span></span>

And the border of the children of Ephraim, according to their families,
was thus,.... Or what follows is the description of it:

even the border of their inheritance on the east side was Atarothaddar,
unto Bethhoron the upper; the first was on the south of the inheritance,
and the latter on the north, as Masius has placed them: who has given us
a type of this description, by which it appears that this lot is here
described in its breadth from south to north.

[Joshua 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 16:6</span></span>

And the border went out towards the sea,.... The Mediterranean sea:

to Michmethah on the north side; of the border, the same on which
Bethhoron was, from whence the border proceeded on to this place, of
which we have no other account but in [Jos
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#007.md); by which it appears to have been
near Shechem, and in sight of it:

and the border went about eastward unto Taanathshiloh; this seems to be
the same Jerom (e) calls Thenath in the tribe of Joseph; and who
observes there was in his day a village of this name ten miles from
Neapolis (or Shechem) to the east, as you go down to Jordan:

and passed by it on the east to Janohah: which the above writer (f)
wrongly calls Janon, and says, that in his time a village of this name
was shown in the country of Acrabatena, twelve miles to the east from
Neapolis or Shechem; the border passed by Taanath on the east of it, and
went on this place.

\(e\) De loc. Heb. fol. 95. C. (f) Ibid. fol. 92. I.

[Joshua 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 16:7</span></span>

And it went down from Johanan to Ataroth,.... This is different from
Ataroth before mentioned, [Jos 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#002.md);
there were several places of this name, as before observed; this seems
to be that which Jerom places four miles from Sebaste or Samaria; see
Gill on [Jos 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#002.md),

and to Naarath; Jerom (g) says, that Naarath was in his time called
Naorath, a village of the Jews, five miles from Jericho; and is the
village Josephus (h) calls Neara, where was a water, half of which
Archelaus turned, and led to the field planted with palm trees, near
Jericho; and, according to the Jewish writers (i): there was a place
called Noaran near to Jericho, which seems to be this:

and came to Jericho, and went out at Jordan; where it ended this way,
which was eastward.

\(g\) De loc. Heb. fol. 93. I. (h) Antiqu. l. 17. c. 15. sect. 1. (i)
Vajikra Rabba, sect. 23. fol. 164. 3. Shirhashirim Rabba, fol. 9. 3.
Echa Rabbati, fol. 50. 4.

[Joshua 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jos 16:8</span></span>

The border went out from Tappuah westward,.... Which was different from
the Tappuah in the tribe of Judah, [Jos
15:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#034.md); this was in the tribe of
Ephraim on the border of Manasseh, [Jos
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#008.md),

unto the river Kanah; supposed by some to be the brook Cherith, by which
Elijah hid himself, [Kg1 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#003.md); though
objected to by others; it seems to have had its name from the reeds
which grew in it, or on the banks of it:

and the goings out thereof were at the sea; if the river Kanah was the
brook Cherith, this must be the dead or salt sea: but that is never
called "the sea", rather the Mediterranean sea is meant, and
consequently Kanah could not be Cherith, which was at too great a
distance from this sea:

this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their
families; that is, this is the description of the border of it; for the
cities within are not mentioned, and the descriptions in general are
very obscure.

[Joshua 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 16:9</span></span>

And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim,.... The tribe of
Ephraim, being much larger than the half tribe of Manasseh, besides the
lot that fell to it, described before by its boundaries, had several
particular and distinct cities given to it: which

were among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh; some that were
upon the borders of Ephraim, and within the territory of Manasseh, and
it may be where it jetted out in a nook or corner, see [Jos
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#008.md),

all the cities with their villages; not the separate cities only, but
the little towns adjacent to them.

[Joshua 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 16:10</span></span>

And they drove not out the Canaanites which dwelt in Gezer,.... Which
was the border of their tribe length ways, and was near the sea, [Jos
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#003.md); in this they did not obey the
command of God, and either they did not drive them out, because they
could not, God not delivering them up into their hands, because of their
sins; or through their slothfulness, or it may be through covetousness,
being willing to make some advantage to themselves by them, being a
trading people, which seems to be intended in the next clause:

but the Canaanites dwelt among the Ephraimites unto this day; which
Joshua, the writer of this book, might truly say, and be no objection to
it, since the same is observed after his death, [Jdg
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#029.md); and indeed they continued to
dwell there until the times of Solomon, when it was taken by Pharaoh
king of Egypt, and given as a present to his daughter, the wife of
Solomon, [Kg1 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#015.md); and though this
clause does not furnish out an argument against the writing of this book
by Joshua, yet, from the instance given, it appears it must have been
written before the times of Solomon, and so not by Ezra, as some:

and serve under tribute; so that they were under their power, and
therefore could have driven them out, or slain them, as by the command
of God they should; but they spared them for the sake of the tribute
they received from them, which seems to agree with the character of the
Ephraimites, [Hos 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#008.md).
