INTRODUCTION TO GALATIANS

The persons to whom this epistle is written were not such who made up a
single church only, in some certain town or city, but were such of which
several churches consisted, in a region or country called Galatia, as is
evident from [Gal 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#002.md) and the members
of these churches seem to be chiefly, if not altogether Jews, since the
apostle includes them with himself; as having been under the law, under
tutors and governors, and in bondage under the elements of the world,
and to whom the law had been a schoolmaster, though now they were no
longer under it as such, [Gal 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#023.md) or
however, though some of them might have been originally Gentiles, yet,
previous to their conversion, had become proselytes to the Jews, and now
were returning to Judaism again, as appears from [Gal
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#008.md). When and from whence this epistle
was written, is not very clear and manifest: some have thought, that it
was written about the time of the writing of the epistle to the Romans,
and upon a like occasion; but if it was written about that time, it
could not he written from Rome, as the subscription to this epistle
attests, since it is certain, that when the apostle wrote his epistle to
the Romans, he had never, as yet, been at Rome. Beza is of opinion, that
it was written from Antioch, between the return of Paul and Barnabas
thither from their first journey, and the troubles which broke out in
that church, [Act 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#028.md). But to this
it is reasonably objected, that it is questionable whether there were so
early any churches in Galatia at all; and if there were, it does not
seem that the defection from the faith, complained of in this epistle,
as yet had took place in any of the churches; for it was after this date
that the troubles upon this head arose at Antioch, which seems to have
been the first place, and the church there the first church the
judaizing teachers practised at and upon. Some Latin exemplars testify
that it was written from Ephesus; of which opinion was Erasmus; but as
Dr. Lightfoot observes, the same reason is against this as the former,
seeing the corruption that was got into this church was then but
beginning, when the apostle was at Ephesus: it seems therefore most
likely, that it was written from Rome, as the subscription in the Greek
copies affirms; and which is strengthened by the Syriac and Arabic
versions, seeing it seems to have been written after the apostle had
made the collections, in several places, for the poor saints at
Jerusalem, [Gal 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#010.md) and when the
apostasy from the faith had got to a great pitch; nor is it any
objection that there is no express mention made of his bonds in it, as
there is in those epistles of his, which were written from Rome; since,
when he wrote this, he might have been delivered from them, as some have
thought he was after his first defence; and besides, he does take notice
of the marks of the Lord Jesus he bore in his body, [Gal
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#017.md). Dr. Lightfoot places the writing
of this epistle in the year and in the "fifth" of Nero; some place it in
55, and others in 58. That there were churches in Galatia very early, is
certain from [Act 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#023.md) but by whom
they were planted is not so evident; very likely by the apostle, since,
it is certain, both from this epistle, that he was personally in this
country, and preached the Gospel here, [Gal
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#013.md) and from [Act
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#006.md) and if he was not the instrument
of the conversion of the first of them, which laid the foundation of a
Gospel church state, yet it is certain, that he was useful in
strengthening the disciples and brethren throughout this country, [Act
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#023.md). But after his departure from
them, the false teachers got among them, and insinuated, that he was no
apostle, at least that he was inferior to Peter, James, and John, the
ministers of the circumcision; and these seduced many of the members of
the churches in this place, drawing them off from the evangelical
doctrine of justification by the righteousness of Christ, persuading
them that the observation of the ceremonial law, particularly
circumcision, was necessary to their acceptance with God, and
justification in his sight: wherefore the occasion and design of this
epistle were to vindicate the character of the apostle as such; to
establish the true doctrine of justification by faith, in opposition to
the works of the law; to recover those who were carried away with the
other doctrines; to exhort the saints to stand fast in the liberty of
Christ, and to various other duties of religion; and to give a true
description of the false teachers, and their views, that so they might
beware of them, and of their principles.
