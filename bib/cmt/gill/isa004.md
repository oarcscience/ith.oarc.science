### [Isaiah Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 4:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO ISAIAH 4

The "first" verse of this chapter [Isa
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#001.md) seems more properly to belong to
the preceding chapter, which declares such a scarcity of men, through
the destruction of them in war, there predicted, that there should be
seven women to one man; who, contrary to their natural modesty, would
make suit to him; and, contrary to custom, propose to provide their own
food and raiment, only desiring to be called by his name. After which,
[Isa 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#002.md), follows a prophecy of
Christ, who is described by his names, the branch of the Lord, and the
fruit of the earth; and by proper epithets of him, as such, beautiful,
glorious, excellent, and comely; and by the persons to whom he is so,
the escaped of Israel, to whom various blessings are promised; as the
sanctification of them, the source of which is their election, and the
means of it the spirit of judgment and burning, [Isa
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#003.md) and the protection and
preservation of them, by the Lord's creating, as for Israel of old, a
cloud of smoke to rest upon them by day, and a shining of flaming fire
by night, and by being himself a tabernacle to screen them from heat in
the day, and a place of refuge to cover them from storm and rain, [Isa
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005.md).

[Isaiah 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 4:1</span></span>

And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man,.... Not in the
days of Ahaz, when Pekah, son of Remaliah, slew in Judah a hundred and
twenty thousand men in one day, [Ch2
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#006.md) as Kimchi thinks; for though
there was then such a destruction of men, yet at the same time two
hundred thousand women, with sons and daughters, were carried captive by
the Israelites, [Ch2 28:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#008.md) but in the
days of Vespasian and Titus, and in the time of their wars with the
Jews; in which were made such slaughters of men, that there were not
enough left for every woman to have a husband; and therefore "seven", or
a great many, sue to one man to marry them, contrary to their natural
bashfulness. It is a tradition of the Jews, mentioned both by Jarchi and
Kimchi, that Nebuchadnezzar ordered his army, that none of them should
marry another man's wife; wherefore every woman sought to get a husband;
but the time of this prophecy does not agree with it:

saying, we will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel; which used
to be provided for wives by their husbands, and that according to law,
[Exo 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#010.md) but rather than be without
a husband, they promise, in order to engage him to marry them, to
provide food and raiment for themselves, by their own labour. The Arabic
version adds,

"neither in anything will we be troublesome:''

only let us be called by thy name; let us be married to thee, let us
become thy wives; for upon marriage the woman was called by her
husband's name:

to take away our reproach: of being unmarried, and having no offspring:
or it may be rendered in the imperative, "take away our reproach" (l);
so the Targum, Septuagint, and Oriental versions. The words may be
accommodated in a spiritual sense to some professors of religion, who
lay hold on Christ in a professional way, but spend their money for that
which is not bread, and live upon their own duties and services, and not
on Christ, and wear their own rags of righteousness, and not his robe;
only they desire to be called by the name of Christians, to take away
the reproach of being reckoned Pagans or infidels.

[Isaiah 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 4:2</span></span>

In that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious,....
When the beauty of the Jewish women shall be taken away, and their men
shall he slain; by whom is meant, not the righteous and wise men left
among the Jews, as Jarchi and Aben Ezra; nor Hezekiah; which is the
sense of some, as the latter observes: but the Messiah, as Kimchi, and
so the Targum, which paraphrases the words thus,

"at that time shall the Messiah of the Lord be for joy and glory;''

and the Septuagint understand it of a divine Person appearing on earth,
rendering the words, "for in that day God shall shine in counsel with
glory upon the earth"; and so the Arabic version. Christ is called "the
branch", not as God, but as man, not as a son, but as a servant, as
Mediator; and it chiefly regards his descent from David, and when his
family was very mean and low; and a branch being but a tender thing, it
denotes Christ's state of humiliation on earth, when he grew up as a
tender plant before the Lord, and was contemptible in the eyes of men:
and he is called the branch "of the Lord", because of his raising up,
and bringing forth; see [Zac 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#008.md) and
yet this branch became "beautiful", being laden with the fruits of
divine grace, such as righteousness, reconciliation, peace, pardon,
adoption, sanctification, and eternal life; as well as having all his
people as branches growing on him, and receiving their life and
fruitfulness from him: and "glorious", being the branch made strong to
do the work of the Lord, by his obedience and death; and especially he
became glorious when raised from the dead, when he ascended up to
heaven, and was exalted there at the right hand of God; and when his
Gospel was spread and his kingdom increased in the Gentile world, as it
did, both before and after the destruction of Jerusalem, the time here
referred to; and which will he in a more glorious condition in the last
days; and now he is glorious in the eyes of all that believe in him, and
is glorified by them; and when he comes a second time, he will appear in
his own and his father's glory, and in the glory of the holy angels.

And the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely; not the
children of the righteous, as Jarchi; nor , "the doers of the law", as
the Targum; see [Rom 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#013.md) but the
Messiah, as before, as Kimchi well observes; called "the fruit of the
earth", to show that he is not a dry and withered, but a fruitful
branch, and which should fill the earth with fruit; and because he
sprung from the earth as man, and was the fruit of a woman, that was of
the earth, earthly; and so this, as the former, denotes the meanness of
Christ in human nature, while here on earth; and yet he became, as these
words foretold be should, "excellent": he appeared to be excellent in
his person as the Son of God, and to have a more excellent name and
nature than the angels, and fairer than the sons of men; to be excellent
as the cedars, and more excellent than the mountains of prey; to have
obtained a more excellent ministry than Aaron and his sons; to be
excellent in all his offices of Prophet, Priest, and King; and
particularly in the fruits and blessings of grace, which grew upon him,
and came from him; see [Deu 33:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#013.md) "and
comely", in his person, as God and man, in the perfections of his divine
nature, and in the fulness of his grace; and so are his people, as
considered in him, who are made perfectly comely, through the comeliness
he puts upon them: and so he is

for them that are escaped of Israel; not beautiful and glorious;
excellent and comely, in the view of all men, only them that believe,
who have seen his glory, and have tasted that he is gracious; these are
the remnant according to the election of grace, the preserved of Israel,
the chosen of God, and precious, who were saved from that untoward
generation, the Jews, and escaped the destruction of Jerusalem, and were
saved in the Lord with an everlasting salvation.

[Isaiah 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 4:3</span></span>

And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that
remaineth in Jerusalem,.... These are the persons to whom Christ appears
beautiful and glorious, excellent and comely, who will be left, and
remain in Zion and Jerusalem; by which is meant the Gospel church, or
church as in the latter day; in which these shall continue, abide by the
truths and doctrines of the Gospel, and the ordinances thereof, and
persevere unto the end; even when Christ shall take his fan in his hand,
and purge his floor of the chaff; when the filth of the daughter of Zion
shall be washed away by the spirit of judgment and burning, as in the
following verse [Isa 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#004.md); when it
shall be a shocking and shaking time in the churches, and the hour of
temptation shall come, that shall try those that dwell upon earth; these
shall be pillars in the temple of God, that shall never go out. The
doctrine of the saints' final perseverance is held forth in these words,
as their sanctification and election are in the following clauses, which
secure it to them: they

shall be called holy: in the original text it is added, "unto him";
either the person left, it shall be said to him, that he is holy or
rather the branch; and Kimchi interprets it, "because of him"; for these
are accounted holy, through the imputation of the holiness of Christ
unto them; and they are really and inherently holy, through the grace of
Christ implanted in them; they are called to be holy, to be saints, and
they are called with a holy calling, and unto holiness; and, in
effectual calling, principles of grace and holiness are wrought in them,
and which appear in their lives and conversations. The principal meaning
seems to be, that those who shall hold fast their profession, and hold
out, and persevere through the trying dispensation in the latter day,
they shall be remarkably holy; they shall shine in the beauties of
holiness; holiness shall be upon their horses' bells, and they
themselves shall be holiness unto the Lord, [Zac
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#020.md).

even everyone that is written among the living in Jerusalem; or,
"everyone that is written unto life" (m), that is, unto eternal life, as
the Targum paraphrases the words; and it is the same with being ordained
unto eternal life, [Act 13:48](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#048.md) or
predestination unto life, which is a writing of the names of God's elect
in the book of life: this writing is God's writing, it is his act and
deed, the act of God the Father, and an eternal one, flowing from his
sovereign will and pleasure, and is sure, certain, and unfrustrable;
what is written is written, and can never be altered; and election being
signified by writing names in a book, shows it to be particular and
personal, not of nations, churches, and bodies of men, but of particular
persons; and that it is irrespective of faith, holiness, and good works,
and entirely unconditional; it is of naked persons, and not as so and so
qualified; and that it is distinguishing of some, and not others, whom
God has an exact knowledge of, and calls by name: and this writing is
"unto life", or "lives", as in the original text; not to a temporal
life, but to a spiritual and eternal one; in consequence of which, such
become living, holy, and persevering Christians in Jerusalem, in the
church of God, and shall be admitted into the New Jerusalem, and none
else, [Rev 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#027.md) and so Jarchi
interprets it, everyone that is written to the life of the world to
come, or to eternal life, shall be in Jerusalem; and the Targum adds,

"and he shall see the consolation of Jerusalem;''

from hence it appears that election is the source and spring of
holiness, and the security of the saints final perseverance, [Rom
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030.md) and is not a licentious doctrine,
but a doctrine according to godliness; holiness is a fruit and evidence
of it; whoever are written or ordained to life become holy; and these
being brought to Zion, remain there, and persevere unto the end.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 4:4</span></span>

When (n) the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of
Zion,.... By Zion is meant the church of Christ in general, his mystical
body, the general assembly and church of the firstborn, written in
heaven, [Heb 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022.md) and by her
"daughters" particular churches, that go by the name of Christian
churches, who are called the reformed churches, being such as are
separated from the church of Rome; among whom there is a great deal of
"filth", and which will be removed in the latter times of the Gospel
dispensation; by which are designed all false doctrines, such as are
contrary to the deity and sonship of Christ, and the personality of the
Holy Spirit; which derogate from the grace of God in election,
justification, pardon, and salvation; which detract from the blood of
Christ, and deny his imputed righteousness and satisfaction; and which
exalt the power and free will of man, and tend to impurity and
licentiousness; these will all be removed, and the true doctrine, which
secures the glory of each divine Person, asserts the free grace of God,
salvation by Christ, the operations of the Spirit, and influences and
engages to holiness of life, will take place. This filth likewise
includes all false worship; all ordinances and institutions of men; all
corruptions in the ordinances of Christ, baptism, and the Lord's supper;
all forms and modes of worship that are not of God; all offices and
officers, except bishops and deacons, which are of the man of sin; and
all immorality and profaneness; and all wicked men, even all that offend
and do iniquity, shall be taken out of Christ's kingdom and churches;
there will be a thorough clearing of his floor of all filth, dirt, and
chaff.

And shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof;
that is, of the daughters of Jerusalem, particular churches, of which
the Jerusalem above is the mother; for this is not to be understood
literally of the city of Jerusalem, nor of the blood of Christ, and his
servants, shed in it, purged away by the burning of it by the Romans;
but of the bloodshed and persecution in Protestant churches; for a
spirit of persecution has prevailed in some of them, but this shall be
no more seen in the latter day; Christ's kingdom will be a peaceable
kingdom, and of the peace of it there will be no end; as there will be
no war in a civil sense, so neither in a religious sense; all
animosities, disputes, and contentions, will cease; see [Isa
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007.md) and much less will there be any
effusion of blood on account of religion, nor any that shed it; as the
Targum paraphrases the words,

"and they that shed innocent blood in Jerusalem shall be removed out of
it:''

it is added,

by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning; the Targum is,

"by the word of judgment, and by the word of consummation or
perfection;''

by the former is meant a judicious spirit, which the Lord will give to
his churches and ministers; a set of ministers will be raised up, having
the everlasting Gospel, which they shall freely, fully, and openly
preach unto all men; by which means the churches will be cleared of all
false doctrines; clear and distinct light will be given to all the
preachers of the word; the watchmen shall see eye to eye; and all Zion's
children be taught of God; and this shall be universal all the world
over; there will be a discerning of spirits of men and doctrines,
whether of God, or not; by which good doctrines will be distinguished
from bad ones, and good men from the wicked; and this will be part of
the judgment which will be given to the saints of the most High, and
will proceed from the Spirit of God; who will be poured out in a
plenteous manner to guide the churches into all truth, as it is in
Jesus; and by the latter, "the spirit of burning", is meant a burning
flaming zeal; a zeal according to knowledge, against all false doctrine
and worship, and for the pure doctrine and worship of Christ; which will
appear in Christian ministers and churches, and also in Christian
magistrates, who will hate the whore, and burn her flesh with fire; and
who will be stirred up by the preachers of the Gospel to pour out the
plagues on the antichristian states, [Rev
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#006.md) and when the fire of God's word
will burn up all the wood, hay, and stubble, which the day will declare;
and then will be the trying winnowing time, and those that are left will
be holy unto the Lord.

\(n\) Or, "for the Lord shall wash away"; so Noldius, in Ebr. Concord.
Part. p. 88. No. 428. which gives a reason why he "that is left in Zion,
&c shall be called holy"; because "the Lord", &c. so the Septuagint
version, ; and Aben Ezra observes, that "if", is used for "because."

[Isaiah 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 4:5</span></span>

And the Lord will create on every dwelling place of Mount Zion,.... That
is, on every particular church of Christ in Gospel times, and especially
in the latter day; which are the dwelling places of Father, Son, and
Spirit, and of believers in Christ. The word (o) used signifies a place
well fitted up, and prepared, and established, and settled; and such
will be the churches of Christ in the latter day glory; they will be
fitly framed together and built up, a habitation for God, through the
Spirit; they will be beautified, and made glorious, and will be
established upon the top of the mountains, and be tabernacles that shall
not be taken down, whose stakes and cords shall not be removed and
broken, [Eph 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#021.md) and so will be sure
dwellings, and quiet resting places; and happy will those be who will be
the inhabitants of them, since they will have the best of company, the
best of provisions, and all health and prosperity, [Isa
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#018.md),

and upon her assemblies; or "her convocations" (p); in allusion to the
holy convocations and solemn assemblies of the Israelites at their
festivals, [Lev 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#002.md) which are the
churches of Christ, as before, consisting of men called by the grace of
God, with a holy calling; called to be saints, and so are an assembly of
saints, [Psa 89:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#007.md) called by means of
the Gospel, as the Israelites were by the blowing of the trumpets, to
assemble together, to hear the word, and attend every part of divine
worship, [Num 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#002.md) and as the
invisible church is called Zion, and the general assembly, [Heb
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022.md) so particular visible churches
are called assemblies, [Ecc 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#011.md) and
which will be very numerous in the latter day, and well attended.

A cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night;
alluding to the Lord's going before the children of Israel in the
wilderness, in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by
night; and to their being upon and covering the tabernacle, when it
rested; and also to the cloud and smoke that were upon Mount Sinai, when
the Lord was present there, [Exo 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#020.md)
and as a cloud was frequently a symbol of the divine Presence, both in
the Old and in the New Testament, [Exo
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#009.md), [Kg1
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#010.md) so it may here signify that the
presence of God with his churches in the latter day will be very
manifest and remarkable; he will be seen over them, and be the glory in
the midst of them, [Zac 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#005.md) and it may
also denote the gracious protection of the churches by Christ from all
their enemies; as the cloud stood between the Israelites and the
Egyptians, when they passed through the Red sea, and secured them from
them, [Exo 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#019.md) as well as a cloud,
is refreshing and protecting from heat, as Christ then will be from heat
of every kind. See Gill on [Isa 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#006.md).
And as the pillar of fire was to give light to the children of Israel,
and direct them in their passage through the wilderness in the night
time; so Christ will be the light of his people, by the very great
illuminations of his spirit, and the clear preaching of the Gospel,
which will give both light and heat; and from both which will arise such
a bright shining light, as shall drive away the night of affliction,
darkness, desertion, and sleepiness, which shall precede this glorious
day. See [Isa 60:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#001.md) and this will be
all the Lord's doing, a work of his almighty power, and therefore
signified by a "creation"; it will be a new, strange, and marvellous
work; wonderful in the eyes of the saints, and in the eyes of the world,
that those who have been forsaken and hated should be made an eternal
excellency, and the joy of many generations, [Isa
60:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#015.md),

for upon all the glory shall he a defence; the glory of the churches in
the latter day will greatly consist in the presence of God and Christ;
in the pouring forth of the Spirit upon them; in the purity of Gospel
doctrine, worship, and discipline among them; in the holiness of their
lives and conversation; and in the peace, harmony, and unity, that shall
subsist with them; and the defence of this glory will be partly the
ministers of the Gospel, in the pure administration of the word and
ordinances, as means, but principally the Lord himself, who will be a
wall of fire about them, and will appoint salvation as walls and
bulwarks to them, [Zac 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#005.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 4:6</span></span>

And there shall be a tabernacle,.... Christ, who tabernacled in our
nature, and is the minister of the true tabernacle, which God pitched,
and not man; who will be spiritually present in the word and ordinances,
where the shepherds pitch their tents; and who will be that to his
people as shepherds' tents are to them, to which the allusion is:

for a shadow in the day time from the heat: from the heat of a fiery
law, which works wrath; from the flaming sword of justice, which calls
for vengeance; from the wrath of God, which is poured forth like fire;
from Satan's temptations, compared to fiery darts; and from the violence
of persecution; for there will be no more after the last struggle of the
beast, and the slaying of the witnesses:

and for a place of refuge; until the indignation be over and past: as
Christ is a refuge for sensible sinners to flee unto for safety, from
avenging justice, and the wrath of God; so he is a place of security,
and has his chambers of safety for saints, from all dangers, and from
every enemy, [Isa 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#020.md),

and for a covert from storm and from rain; from the blast of the
terrible ones, the antichristian powers, which will be as a storm
against a wall, [Isa 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#004.md) this will be
the hour of temptation, which will come upon and try them that dwell
upon the earth, from which Christ will preserve his faithful ones, [Rev
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#010.md).
