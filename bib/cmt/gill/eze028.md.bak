INTRODUCTION TO EZEKIEL 28

This chapter contains a prophecy of the destruction of the prince of
Tyre; a lamentation for the king of Tyre; a denunciation of judgments on
Zidon, and a promise of peace and safety to Israel. The order given the
prophet to prophesy of the ruin of the prince of Tyre, [Eze
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#001.md), the cause of his ruin, his pride
on account of his wisdom and riches, which rose to such a pitch, as to
make himself God, [Eze 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#002.md), the
manner in which his destruction shall be accomplished, [Eze
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#007.md), the lamentation for the king of
Tyre begins [Eze 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#011.md), setting forth
his former grandeur and dignity, [Eze
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#013.md), his fall, and the cause of it,
injustice and violence in merchandise, pride because of beauty and
wisdom, and profanation of sanctuaries, [Eze
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#016.md), next follow the judgments on
Zidon, [Eze 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#020.md), and the chapter is
concluded with a promise of the restoration of the Jews to their own
land, and of great tranquillity and safety in it, [Eze
28:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#024.md).

[Ezekiel 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 28:1</span></span>

The word of the Lord came again unto me,.... With another prophecy; as
before against the city of Tyre, now against the king of Tyre:

saying; as follows:

[Ezekiel 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 28:2</span></span>

Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyre,.... Whose name was Ethbaal, or
Ithobalus, as he is called in Josephus; for that this was Hiram that was
in the days of Solomon, and lived a thousand years, is a fable of the
Jewish Rabbins, as Jerom relates: this prince of Tyre is thought by some
to be an emblem of the devil; but rather of antichrist; and between them
there is a great agreement, and it seems to have a prophetic respect to
him:

thus saith the Lord God, because thine heart is lifted up: with pride,
on account of his wisdom and knowledge, wealth and riches, as later
mentioned:

and thou hast said, I am a god; this he said in his heart, in the pride
of it, and perhaps expressed it with his lips, and required divine
homage to be given him by his subjects, as some insolent, proud, and
haughty monarchs have done; in which he was a lively type of antichrist,
who shows himself, and behaves, as if he was God, taking upon him what
belongs to God; pardoning the sins of men; opening and shutting the
gates of heaven; binding men's consciences with laws of his own making,
and dispensing with the laws of God and man; and calling himself or
suffering himself to be called God, and to be worshipped as such; See
Gill on [Th2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004.md),

I sit in the seat of God; in a place as delightful, safe and happy, as
heaven itself, where the throne of God is; so antichrist is said to sit
in the temple of God, in the house and church of God; where he assumes a
power that does not belong to him, calling himself God's vicegerent, and
Christ's vicar; see [Th2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004.md), and the
Arabic version here renders it "in the house of God": it follows,

in the midst of the seas; surrounded with them as Tyre was, and lord of
them as its king was; sending his ships into all parts, and to whom all
brought their wares; thus the whore of Rome is said to sit upon many
waters, [Rev 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#002.md),

yet thou art a man, and not God; a frail, weak, mortal man, and not the
mighty God, as his later destruction shows; and as the popes of Rome
appear to be, by their dying as other men; and as antichrist will
plainly be seen to be when he shall be destroyed with the breath of
Christ's mouth, and the brightness of his coming:

though thou set thine heart as the heart of God; as if it was as full of
wisdom and knowledge as his; and thinkest as well of thyself, that thou
art a sovereign as he, and to be feared, obeyed, and submitted to by
all.

[Ezekiel 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 28:3</span></span>

Behold; thou art wiser than Daniel,.... That is, in his own opinion; or
it is ironically said. The Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic versions,
render it by way of interrogation, "art thou not wiser than Daniel?" who
was now at the court of Babylon, and was famous throughout all Chaldea
for his knowledge in politics, his wisdom and prudence in government, as
well as his skill in interpreting dreams. The Jews have a saying, that

"if all the wise men of the nations were in one scale, and Daniel in the
other, he would weigh them all down.''

And perhaps the fame of him had reached the king of Tyre, and yet he
thought himself wiser than he; see [Zac
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#002.md), antichrist thinks himself wiser
than Daniel, or any of the prophets and apostles; he is wise above that
which is written, and takes upon him the sole interpretation of the
Scriptures, and to fix the sense of them:

there is no secret that they can hide from thee; as he fancied; he had
sagacity to penetrate into the councils of neighbouring princes, and
discover all plots and intrigues against him; he understood all the
"arcana" and secrets of government, and could counterwork the designs of
his enemies. Antichrist pretends to know all mysteries, and solve all
difficulties, and pass an infallible judgment on things; as if he was of
the privy council of heaven, and nothing was transacted there but he was
acquainted with it, and had full knowledge of the mind of God in all
things.

[Ezekiel 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 28:4</span></span>

With thy wisdom and with thy understanding thou hast gotten thee
riches,.... Through skill in navigation and trade, for which the Tyrians
and their princes were famous, they acquired great wealth: so
antichrist, by carnal policy, and hellish subtlety, has amassed vast
treasures together; the sale of pardons and indulgences has brought
immense riches into the pope's coffers:

and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures; in great quantities;
see [Rev 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#003.md).

[Ezekiel 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 28:5</span></span>

By thy great wisdom and by thy traffic,.... Or, "by thy great wisdom in
thy traffic" (i); through great skill in trade and commerce:

hast thou increased thy riches; to a very great degree, a prodigious
bulk; so antichrist has done, especially through trafficking with the
souls of men, which is one part of his merchandise, as it was of Tyre,
[Rev 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#013.md),

and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches; which are apt to
puff up and make men highminded, and swell them with a vain opinion of
themselves, and to make haughty, insolent, and scornful, in their
behaviour to others; thus elated with worldly grandeur and riches, the
whore of Rome is represented as proud, vain, and haughty, [Rev
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#007.md).

\(i\) "in negotione tua", V. L. Pagninus, Starckius; "in mercatura tua",
Junius & Tremellius.

[Ezekiel 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 28:6</span></span>

Therefore thus saith the Lord God,.... Now follows the punishment
threatened, because of all this pride, haughtiness, and blasphemy:

because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of God; seeking thine own
glory; setting up thyself above all others; assuming that to thyself
which belongs to God; and making thyself equal to him, or showing
thyself as if thou wast God; See Gill on [Eze
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#002.md).

[Ezekiel 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 28:7</span></span>

Behold, therefore, I will bring strangers upon thee,.... The Chaldean
army, who not only lived at a distance from Tyre, but were unknown to
them, not trading with them; nor are they mentioned among the merchants
of Tyre: these, in the mystical sense, may design the angels that shall
pour out the vials on the antichristian states, the kings of Protestant
nations:

the terrible of the nations; as the Babylonians were, very formidable to
the world, having conquered many countries, and their armies consisting
of men of all nations, mighty, courageous, and expert in war; and alike
formidable will the Protestant princes be to the antichristian powers,
when they shall with their united strength attack them:

and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom; their
beautiful city and spacious buildings, the palaces of their king and
nobles, their walls and towers erected with so much art and skill; or
their forces, the men of war within their city, which made their beauty
complete, so well skilled in military affairs, [Eze
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#010.md), or their ships, and the
merchandise of them, and the curious things brought in them: even
everything that was rich and valuable, the effect of their art and
wisdom: all which may be applied to the city of Rome, when it will be
taken, ransacked, and burnt, [Rev
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#008.md),

and they shall defile thy brightness; profane thy crown, cast down thy
throne, destroy thy kingdom, and all that is great and glorious in thee;
thus the whore of Rome shall be made bare and desolate, [Rev
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#016.md). The Targum renders it,

"the brightness of thy terror;''

which shall no more strike the nations, or affect them.

[Ezekiel 28:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 28:8</span></span>

They shall bring thee down to the pit,.... Or, "to corruption" (k); to
the grave, the pit of corruption and destruction; so antichrist shall go
into perdition, into the bottomless pit from whence he came, [Rev
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#008.md),

and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the
seas; that die in a sea fight, whose carcasses are thrown overboard, and
devoured by fishes.

\(k\) "ad corruptionem".

[Ezekiel 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 28:9</span></span>

Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I am God?.... When thou
art in the enemies' hands, and just going to be put to death, wilt thou
then confidently assert thy deity, and to his face tell him that thou
art God? surely thy courage and thy confidence, thy blasphemy and
impiety, will leave thee then; a bitter sarcasm this! and so the pope of
Rome, the antichristian beast, when taken, and just going to be cast
into the lake of fire along with the false prophet, will not have the
impudence to style himself God, or to call himself Christ's vicar on
earth:

but thou shalt be a man, and no god, in the hand of him that slayeth
thee; that is, thou shalt appear to be a poor, weak, frail, mortal,
trembling, dying man, when got into the hand of the enemy, and he is
just going to put an end to thy life; where will be then thy boasted
deity?

[Ezekiel 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 28:10</span></span>

Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised,.... Or the death of the
wicked, as the Targum; the first and second death, temporal and eternal:
the former

by the hand of strangers, the Chaldeans, in various shapes; and the
latter will follow upon it: it may denote the various kinds of death
which the inhabitants of Rome will die when destroyed, some by famine,
some by pestilence, and others by fire; when these plagues shall come
upon her in one day, [Rev 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#008.md).

for I have spoken it, saith the Lord God; and therefore it shall surely
come to pass; strong is the Lord that will judge, condemn, and destroy
mystical Babylon, or Tyre.

[Ezekiel 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 28:11</span></span>

Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me,.... After the prophecy
concerning the ruin of the prince of Tyre, the word of the Lord came to
the prophet, ordering him to take up a lamentation on the king of Tyre:

saying; as follows:

[Ezekiel 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 28:12</span></span>

Take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus,.... Who is before called
the prince of Tyre; and who he was See Gill on [Eze
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#002.md), the bishop of Rome was first
only a "nagid", a prince, ruler, governor, and leader in the church;
afterwards he became a king, a head, even over other kings, princes, and
states; perhaps this may also point to his twofold power, secular and
ecclesiastical, and so he is represented by two beasts, [Rev
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001.md), here a lamentation or funeral
ditty is ordered to be taken up and said for him, to denote his certain
destruction and ruin; though some have thought the fall of the angels,
and others the fall of Adam, is referred to; several passages are
interpreted of Adam in the Talmud (l):

and say unto him, thus saith the Lord God, thou sealest up the sum; or
"pattern" (m); of everything that is excellent; thou art in all things,
consummately so, as that nothing could be added; that is, in his own
esteem and account. Junius thinks it refers to the sealing of goods
exported, for which a duty was to be paid, without doing which
merchandise was not allowed. Antichrist would not suffer any to buy or
sell but such as receive his mark or seal on their right hand, or in
their forehead, [Rev 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#016.md). Cocceius
renders it, "the sealer of the measure" (n); and takes it to be an
allusion to the custom of sealing measures, used in buying and selling;
and that it respects the man of sin, who takes upon him the power of
making rules and canons for faith and practice:

full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty; a most accomplished man for parts
and person in his own conceit: antichrist assumes to himself a perfect
knowledge of the Scriptures, and sets up himself as an infallible judge
of controversies; and glories in the splendour and order of his church,
and the government of it.

[Ezekiel 28:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 28:13</span></span>

Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God,.... Not only in Eden, but in
the garden which was in Eden, and was of the Lord's immediate planting;
and therefore called the garden of God, as well as because of its
excellency, fragrancy, and delight; not that the king of Tyre was
literally there, or ever dwelt in it; but his situation in Tyre was as
safe, and as pleasant and delightful, as Adam's was in the garden of
Eden, at least in his own imagination. So the Targum,

"thou delightest thyself with plenty of all good things and delectable
ones, as if thou dwellest in the garden of God;''

in the mystical sense, this designs the church of God, which is an Eden,
a garden, a paradise; see [Sol 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#012.md)
and where antichrist first appeared, and took his seat, and seated
himself as if he was God, [Th2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004.md),

every precious stone was thy covering; not only the covering of his
head, his crown, was decked with jewels and precious stones of all
sorts; but his clothes, the covering of his body, were adorned with
them. So the Targum,

"all precious stones were set in order upon thy garments.''

Kimchi renders it "thine hedge", or "fence" (o); and takes it to be an
hyperbole, as if his house, or garden, or vineyard, were fenced with
precious stones. This fitly describes the whore of Rome arrayed in
purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones,
[Rev 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#004.md). The pope's triple crown is
stuck with them, and a cross of precious stones is upon his slipper,
when he holds out his toe to be kissed:

the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the
jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold. Writers
differ very much about these stones; and it is difficult to say what
answer to the Hebrew words here used. The stone "sardius", or the
sardine stone, is of a blood colour, commonly called a cornelian, and is
found in Sardis and Sardinia, from whence some say it has its name. The
"topaz" is a hard transparent stone, said to be of a beautiful yellow or
gold colour by those who confound it with the chrysolite; otherwise the
true topaz is of a fine green colour, as Pliny (p) and Isidore (q); the
best is what is found in Ethopia, [Job
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#019.md). The "diamond" is a precious
stone, the first in rank, value, hardness and lustre; the most perfect
colour is the white. The "beryl" is a stone of a pale green colour,
thought to be the diamond of the ancients: the word is "tarshish", and
thought by some the "chrysolite". The "onyx" resembles a man's nail,
from whence it has its name: the word "shoham" here used is supposed to
mean the "sardonyx", a compound of the "sardian" and "onyx" stones. The
"jasper" is a stone of various colours and spots, variegated like a
panther; hence the Targum here renders it "pantherin"; the most valuable
is the green spotted with red or purple. The "sapphire" is a stone of an
azure colour or sky blue, exceeding hard and transparent. The "emerald"
is of an exceeding fine green colour, very bright, and clear, and
delightful to the eye; but is rather intended by the next word, as the
"carbuncle" by this, which is a stone of the ruby kind, and very rare;
see [Isa 54:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#012.md). "Gold" is mentioned
along with them, and last of all, as being less valuable; but chiefly
because these stones were set in gold, as the Targum paraphrases it;
these are nine of the stones which were in the breastplate of the Jewish
high priest (r), whom the king of Tyre might have knowledge of and
imitate, as it is certain the pope of Rome does in some things:

the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in
the day that thou wast created; either born into the world; or made a
crowned king; against which time, drums, and pipes, and such like
instruments of music, were prepared in Tyre, and at them made use of by
way of rejoicing: and as this was literally true of the king of Tyre at
his coronation, so of the bishop of Rome at his creation and
inauguration, which is attended with bells ringing, drums beating,
trumpets sounding; and so in mystical Babylon is heard, though the time
is coming when it will not be heard, the voice of harpers, musicians,
pipers, and trumpeters, [Rev 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#022.md).

[Ezekiel 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 28:14</span></span>

Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth,.... In allusion to the
cherubim over the mercy seat, which covered it with their wings; and
which, as the ark of the testimony and all the vessels of the tabernacle
were anointed, were so likewise; in all probability the king of Tyre is
called a "cherub" because of his wisdom and power; "anointed", because
of his royal dignity; and "that covereth", because of his office, which
was to protect his people; all which he either was, or ought to be, or
was in his own opinion so: antichrist makes great boasts of his wisdom,
power, and authority, as a teacher, pastor, or bishop, the cherubim
being symbolical of the ministers of the word; and of his being anointed
by men, that he may be the cover and shield of the church; and of his
being the Lord's anointed, and the vicar of Christ, and head and
protector of the church, as he calls himself (s). The Targum understands
all this of regal power, and renders it,

"thou art a king anointed for a kingdom:''

and I have set thee so; from whom all kings have their sceptres, crowns,
and kingdoms; and by whom they reign; and who can put them down as well
as set them up at his pleasure. It may be rendered, "I have given thee"
(t); or suffered thee to be so, as the word "give" is often used; it is
by divine permission that antichrist has taken such power to himself,
and in judgment to them over whom he rules, who are given up to believe
a lie; yea, God "put", or, as it is in the original text, "gave" it into
the hearts of the kings to agree and give their kingdom to the beast,
[Rev 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#017.md),

thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; not on Sinai, nor on Zion; on
neither of which was the king of Tyre; nor was this literally true of
him; for to say, as Kimchi does to illustrate it, that Hiram king of
Tyre assisted Solomon with materials to build the temple, is very
foreign; but this is true of the antitype of the king of Tyre,
antichrist; who has set his foot on God's holy mountain the church; here
he first appeared and stood, as before observed on the preceding verse:

thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire; which
some understand of the precious stones with which the king of Tyre was
adorned, which glittered like fire; though rather they design the people
of God, those living lively stones of which the spiritual house is
built; who, for their clear light, and burning zeal and love, may be
said to be as stones of fire; and among these the bishop of Rome, or the
antichristian king of Tyre, first walked: so Kimchi interprets them of
the Israelites, who were a holy people; and Jarchi of the kings of
Israel, who were as the ministering angels; the seraphim perhaps he
means, so called from their burning and flaming love. The Targum is,

"and over the holy people thou hast thought to rule.''

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 28:15</span></span>

Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created,....
From the time that Tyre became a kingdom, or this king was set over it,
everything was wisely conducted, and all things happily succeeded; so
when the church of Rome was first formed in the times of the apostles,
it was laid on a good foundation; it was set up according to the rule of
the word; its bishop or pastor was one of a sound judgment, a good life
and conversation, and so continued In succession for a considerable
time; these held the true faith and doctrine of Christ, and kept it
incorrupt, and lived holy lives:

till iniquity was found in thee; pride, blasphemy against God, and
contempt of his people, as well as violence and deceit; all this was
found in the king of Tyre in later times: so in the church of Rome, when
the man of sin was revealed, there were pride, haughtiness, and
ambition, found in it; blasphemy against God and Christ, and the saints:
false doctrine, false worship, superstition, and idolatry.

[Ezekiel 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 28:16</span></span>

By the multitude of thy merchandise,.... With the several nations of the
earth, who came to the markets and fairs of Tyre, and to whom she sent
her goods:

they have filled the midst of thee with violence; or, as the Targum,

"thy treasures are filled with rapine;''

with ill gotten goods, as the pope's coffers are through his merchandise
of the souls of men, and the great trade that is driven in pardons and
indulgences:

and thou hast sinned; by this unjust and ungodly way of dealing:

therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God; Mount
Zion, the church of the living God, where he dwells, and is worshipped,
and on which the Lamb stands with his hundred and forty and four
thousand, having his name and his Father's on their foreheads, [Rev
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#001.md), these will have no communion
with the church and pope of Rome; will not receive his mark, nor worship
his image; from this mountain, and the inhabitants of it, he stands
excluded as a profane person, with whom they will have nothing to do;
and hence he persecutes them to the utmost of his power:

and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones
of fire; from among the people of God, who have the clear light of the
Gospel, and a sincere love for Christ; these withdrew themselves from
his jurisdiction and government; and with whom his name, power, and
authority perish, especially when they shall have got the victory over
him, [Rev 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#001.md). Kimchi paraphrases it,

"from the midst of the saints who are the Israelites, comparable to
stones of fire;''

and Jarchi's note is,

"that thou mayest not take a portion with the righteous;''

have no part, lot, or fellowship with them. The Targum is,

"I will destroy thee, O king that art anointed, because thou thoughtest
to rule over the holy people.''

[Ezekiel 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 28:17</span></span>

Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty,.... Riches, wealth,
power, and authority; see [Eze 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#005.md),
as the pope of Rome is, because of his dignity, the pomp and splendour
of the Roman church, and the gaudy appearance it makes:

thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness; outward
lustre and glory, which dazzled his eyes so that he could not see things
in a true light; but neglecting the word of God, and setting up his own
infallibility, corrupted his doctrine and worship, and became foolish,
stupid, and sottish:

I will cast thee to the ground; from the throne and pinnacle of honour,
to the lowest state and condition:

and I will lay thee before kings: prostrate at the feet of them, who
heretofore has set his feet on the necks of them; or he shall fall
before them, and be destroyed by them, when they shall hate the whore,
and make her desolate, and burn her flesh with fire, [Rev
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#016.md), that they may behold thee; with
contempt and disdain, and as an instance and example of divine
vengeance.

Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine
iniquities,.... Or, "thy palaces", as Kimchi; the palace of the king,
and the palaces of the nobles, where much iniquity was committed, and
which was the cause of their being defiled or destroyed by the
Chaldeans; or it may design their sacred places, their temples, where
their gods were worshipped, and idolatry committed. This may be applied
to the places of religious worship among the Papists, their churches;
which, instead of being adorned, are defiled with their images and image
worship, and other acts of superstition and will worship:

by the iniquity of thy traffic; as by bringing in ill gotten goods into
the sacred places of Tyre, as they were accounted, so by selling
pardons; praying souls out of purgatory for money; by simony, or buying
and selling ecclesiastical benefices; and such like spiritual
merchandise in Roman churches:

therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall
devour thee; sin, and the punishment of it, as Kimchi; which, for sin
committed in the midst of them, should consume as fire; or some from
among themselves, that should stir up and cause internal divisions,
which should issue in their ruin; as the unclean spirit that shall go
out of the mouth of the beast, dragon, and false prophet, to gather the
antichristian kings to battle, will end in their ruin, [Rev
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#014.md). The Targum is,

"I will bring people who are strong as fire, because of the sins of thy
pride they shall destroy thee.''

Alexander, when he took Tyre, ordered all the inhabitants to be slain,
excepting those that fled to the temples, and the houses to be set on
fire (u); which literally fulfilled this prophecy; and which may also
have respect to the destruction of Rome by fire, because of the sins
committed in it, [Rev 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#008.md),

and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth, in the sight of all them
that behold thee; the kings and merchants of the earth, who shall stand
and look on the city as it is burning, and when reduced to ashes; which
denotes the utter destruction of it, [Rev
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#009.md). The Targum is,

"I will give thee as ashes on the earth, &c.'

and shall be no more accounted of.

All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at
thee,.... At thy fall; that such a mighty city, and powerful prince,
should be destroyed at once; that, from such a height of prosperity,
they should be brought to so low an estate of adversity; this will be
the astonishment of kings, merchants, and others, that knew the riches,
power, and flourishing estate of Rome, as before observed:

thou shalt be a terror; to the said persons, who will be afraid to come
nigh for fear of the same torments and punishment, [Rev
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#010.md), or, though thou "hast been a
terror"; or "terrors"; exceeding terrible to others in time past, yet
now, as the Targum,

"I will give thee (or make thee) as if thou wast not:''

and never shalt thou be any more; as thou hast been, or after thy last
destruction; so mystical Tyre or Babylon shall be no more, when once
destroyed, [Rev 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#021.md).

[Ezekiel 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 28:20</span></span>

Again, the word of the Lord came unto me,.... After the prophecy of the
destruction of the prince and king of Tyre, concerning a neighbouring
city:

saying as follows:

[Ezekiel 28:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 28:21</span></span>

Son of man, set thy face against Zidon,.... An ancient city, near to
Tyre, and in confederacy with it, greatly given to idolatry and
superstition; and may design all the antichristian states in the
communion of the church of Rome:

and prophesy against it; the prophet is bid to look towards this place
with a stern countenance, as before against Tyre; threatening it with
ruin, and prophesying of it, in the following manner.

[Ezekiel 28:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 28:22</span></span>

The eternal Jehovah, the only true God, the Maker of heaven and earth;
this is said by way of preface to the prophecy, and to assure of the
fulfilment of it, as well as in opposition to the gods of the Zidonians:

behold, I am against thee, O Zidon; angry with thee, and will come out
against thee in my wrath, because of thine idolatries and impieties. The
Targum is,

"behold, I send my fury upon thee, O Zidon:''

I will be glorified in the midst of thee; not by the conversion of them;
nor by acts of religious worship truly performed by them: by prayer,
confession of sin, or thanksgiving; but by his judgments executed in the
midst of them; by pouring out the vials of his wrath on them, as it
follows:

and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have executed
judgments in her; for the Lord is known, by the judgments he executes,
to be that pure, holy, just, and sin avenging God he is, as well as
omniscient and omnipotent; and this even Heathens and antichristian
persons are obliged to acknowledge, [Psa
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#015.md),

and shall be sanctified in her; that is, shall appear, be declared and
owned, to be a God, just and holy, in all his ways and works.

[Ezekiel 28:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 28:23</span></span>

And I will send into her pestilence, and blood into her streets,.... The
plague and the sword, which are two of God's sore judgments, and often
go together; the pestilence slays them that are within, and the sword
those the enemy meets with in the streets:

and the wounded shall be judged; that is, punished; or "shall fall" (w),
die and perish:

in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side; this was
literally fulfilled in Zidon, either by Nebuchadnezzar and the Chaldean
army, which besieged it on every side; or by Artaxerxes Ochus the
Persian, who took it, and destroyed it; and will have its accomplishment
on the antichristian states, eastern and western, when the vials shall
be poured out upon them, [Rev 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#001.md),

and they shall know that I am the Lord God; who am able to foretell
things to come, and to accomplish them.

And there shall be no more a pricking brier to the house of Israel,....
To the church of God, Jews or Gentiles, particularly to the Jews, who
will now be converted; all the enemies of Christ and his people will now
be destroyed, who have been very grievous and distressing to them by
their furious persecutions; the pope and Turk will be no more, nor any
of the antichristian powers; the beast and false prophet will be taken
and cast into the lake of fire; and there will be none to hurt and
destroy in all the holy mountain, [Rev
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020.md),

nor any grieving thorn of all that are round about them that despised
them; the same thing in other words as before; wicked men, especially
tyrannical princes, furious persecutors of the saints, are like thorns
and briers, not only unfruitful, useless, and unprofitable, but
pricking, grieving, and hurtful to good men, by their persecutions,
revilings, and reproaches, and whose end is to be burned. The Targum of
the whole is,

"and there shall be no more to the house of Israel a king that doth evil
(or hurt), or a governor that oppresses all round about them that spoil
them:''

and they shall know that I am the Lord; the house of Israel, the Jews
now converted, they shall know the Lord Christ, and acknowledge him to
be their Lord and King.

[Ezekiel 28:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 28:25</span></span>

Thus saith the Lord God, when I shall have gathered the house of
Israel,.... Not at the return of them from captivity in Babylon; for the
ten tribes or house of Israel did not then return; though there might
some few of those tribes, as a pledge of what would be hereafter; but in
the latter day, upon the destruction of antichrist, when all Israel
shall be saved: and when they will be collected

from the people among whom they are scattered; in the several nations of
the world, in Asia, Africa, and Europe:

and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the Heathen; being
believed in by them; prayed unto and worshipped in a spiritual manner by
them; professed and owned to be their Saviour and Redeemer in the face
of the whole world, Christians and even Heathens, whom before they
rejected: then shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my
servant Jacob; the land of Canaan, given by promise to Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob; which last is only here mentioned, because it was his
posterity that was to possess it; not all Abraham's, only those in the
line of Isaac; nor all Isaac's, only those in the line of Jacob; but all
his; and this they will do when they are converted in the latter day,
and be no more a vagabond people, as they now are.

[Ezekiel 28:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eze 28:26</span></span>

And they shall dwell safely therein,.... There being none to make them
afraid, all their enemies being destroyed, and they also under the
protection of Christian princes:

and they shall build houses and plant vineyards; signifying their
continuance in their land, and their enjoyment of the blessings of it.
Cocceius understands this of churches gathered in the name of Christ; of
which no doubt there will be many in Judea, as in the first times of the
Gospel, and more abundantly:

yea, they shall dwell with confidence: in the utmost safety and
security, having nothing to fear from any quarter:

when I have executed judgment upon all those that despise them round
about them; took vengeance on them, and utterly destroyed them that
despised or spoiled them, even all around them; they will all be cut
off, so that there will be none to give them the least disturbance:

and they shall know that I am the Lord their God: not only God, as
before, [Eze 28:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#024.md), but their God,
their Lord and their God, their Redeemer and Saviour, whom they formerly
denied, persecuted, and pierced.
