INTRODUCTION TO EXODUS 7

Moses and Aaron are ordered to go to Pharaoh, and require the dismission
of the people of Israel, but they are told before hand that Pharaoh's
heart would be hardened, and would refuse to let them go, until the hand
of the Lord was stretched out, and great judgments were brought down
upon, Egypt, and then they should come forth, [Exo
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#001.md), which orders Moses and Aaron
obeyed, and their age is observed, when this was done, [Exo
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#006.md) and they are bid to work a
miracle, when Pharaoh should demand one, by turning a rod into a
serpent, which they did; but Pharaoh's magicians doing the same in
appearance, his heart was hardened, [Exo
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#008.md) and then they are directed to meet
him at the river, and require the same as before; and if he refused, to
smite the waters of the river with the rod, and turn them into blood,
which they did, [Exo 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#015.md), but
Pharaoh's magicians doing the same by enchantments, he did not regard
it, though the plague lasted seven days, [Exo
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#022.md).

[Exodus 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 7:1</span></span>

And the Lord said unto Moses,.... In answer to his objection, taken from
his own meanness, and the majesty of Pharaoh, and from his want of
readiness and freedom of expression:

see; take notice of, observe what I am about to say:

I have made thee a god to Pharaoh; not a god by nature, but made so; he
was so by commission and office, clothed with power and authority from
God to act under him in all things he should direct; not for ever, as
angels are gods, but for a time; not in an ordinary way, as magistrates
are gods, but in an extraordinary manner; and not to any other but to
Pharaoh, being an ambassador of God to him, and as in his room and stead
to, rule over him, though so great a monarch; to command him what he
should do, and control him when he did wrong, and punish him for his
disobedience, and inflict such plagues upon him, and do such miracles
before him, as no mere man of himself, and none but God can do; and even
exercise the power of life and death, as in the slaying of the
firstborn, that Pharaoh should stand in as much fear of him, as if he
was a deity, and apply to him to remove the plagues upon him, as if he
was one:

and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet; to declare the will of God
revealed to him by Moses from the Lord; so that this seems to be more
than to be the mouth and spokesman of Moses and interpreter and
explainer of his words, or to be acting the part of an orator for him;
for Moses in this affair being God's viceregent, and furnished with a
knowledge of the mind and will of God respecting it, as well as with
power to work miracles, and inflict plagues, was made a god to both
Pharaoh and Aaron; see [Exo 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#006.md) to
Pharaoh in the sense before explained, and to Aaron, he being his
prophet, to whom he communicated the secrets of God, and his will and
pleasure, in order to make the same known to Pharaoh. Thus highly
honoured was Moses to be a god to a sovereign prince, and to have Aaron
to be his prophet.

[Exodus 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 7:2</span></span>

Thou shalt speak all that I command thee,.... That is, to Aaron his
prophet, whatever the Lord made known to him in a private manner as his
will to be done:

and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh; whatsoever should be
told him by Moses, as from the Lord:

that he send the children of Israel out of his land; this was the
principal thing to be insisted upon; and all that was said or done to
him was to bring about this end, the dismission of the children of
Israel out of Egypt.

[Exodus 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 7:3</span></span>

And I will harden Pharaoh's heart,.... See Gill on [Exo
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#021.md).

and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt; work one
miracle and wonderful sign after another, until they are all wrought
intended to be wrought; and which he had given Moses power to do, and
until the end should be answered and obtained, the letting go of the
children of Israel.

[Exodus 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 7:4</span></span>

But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you,.... Regard not what they said,
nor answer the demand they made, or obey the command of God delivered by
them to him: this the Lord apprised them of, that they might not be
discouraged, and conclude their labour would be in vain, their attempts
fruitless, and they should never gain their point, but spend their time,
and expose themselves to danger to no purpose:

that I may lay mine hand upon Egypt; the inhabitants of Egypt, smiting
them with one plague after another, and particularly with the last,
slaying their firstborn; every plague was a stroke of his hand, and an
effect of his mighty power and vengeance, and more especially that:

and bring forth mine armies; the children of Israel consisting of
600,000 men, besides women and children, [Exo
12:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#037.md) which, divided into twelve
tribes, made twelve fine armies, 50,000 men in a tribe or army upon an
average:

and my people the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt; the word
"and" need not be supplied; if any supplement is necessary, the word
"even" would be better, since this clause is added by way of
explanation, showing who are meant by the armies of the Lord, his people
to be brought out:

by great judgments; inflicted upon the Egyptians.

[Exodus 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 7:5</span></span>

And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord,.... Jehovah, the one
only true and living God; this they should know by the judgments
executed upon them, and be obliged to acknowledge it:

when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt: especially the last time, to
destroy the firstborn:

and bring out the children of Israel from among them; by which it would
appear that he was mightier than they, and obtained the end for which
the plagues were inflicted on them.

[Exodus 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 7:6</span></span>

And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord commanded them,.... After this they
never showed any reluctance, or made any objection to any message they
were sent with, or any work they were ordered to do, but went about it
at once, and performed it with all readiness and cheerfulness:

so did they; which is not a superfluous and redundant expression, but
very emphatic, showing with what care and diligence they did every
thing, and how exactly they conformed in all things to the divine will.

[Exodus 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 7:7</span></span>

And Moses was eighty years old,.... At this time, which is observed
partly to show how long Israel had been afflicted in Egypt; for their
great troubles and miseries began about the time of the birth of Moses,
or a little before, as appears from the above history; and partly to
show the patience and forbearance of God with the Egyptians, and how
just and righteous were his judgments on them; with this perfectly
agrees Stephen's account of the age of Moses, [Act
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#023.md) and Aaron eighty three years old,
when they spake unto Pharaoh; so that they were men that had had a large
experience of things, and had been long training up for the service
designed to be done by them; they were men of wisdom and prudence, of
sedate and composed countenances, and fit to appear before a king, whose
age and venerable aspect might command attention to them. Aben Ezra
observes, that"in all the Scripture there is no mention of any prophets
that prophesied in their old age but these, because their excellency was
greater than all the prophets.''By this it appears that Aaron was three
years older than Moses. A Jewish chronologer says (n), that it is
affirmed in an exposition of theirs, that Aaron prophesied to the
Israelites in Egypt eighty years, which is making him to be a very young
prophet when he first entered into the office. The Arabic writers (o)
say, Miriam was at this time eighty seven, so was seven years older than
Moses, and four years older than Aaron; see [Exo
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#004.md).

[Exodus 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 7:8</span></span>

And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron,.... After he had given
them their commission, and instructions to go to Pharaoh, and a little
before they went in to him:

saying, as follows.

[Exodus 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 7:9</span></span>

When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, show a miracle for you,....
To prove that they came from God, the Jehovah they said they did, and
that they were his ambassadors, and came in his name, and made the
demand for him; which when he seriously reflected on things, he would be
ready to require, hoping they would not be able to show any, and then he
should have somewhat against them, and treat them as impostors:

then thou shalt say unto Aaron, take thy rod; the same that Moses had in
his hand at Horeb, and brought with him to Egypt; this he had delivered
into the hand of Aaron, who was to be his agent, and with this rod do
signs and wonders as he did, and on account of them it is sometimes
called the rod of God:

and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent; as it became
one before at Horeb, when Moses by the order of God cast it on the
ground, and afterwards became a rod again, as it now was, [Exo
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#002.md) Hence Mercury, the messenger of
the gods with the Heathens, is represented as having a "caduceus", a rod
or wand twisted about with snakes (p).

[Exodus 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 7:10</span></span>

And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh,.... Into the palace of Pharaoh
boldly, and with intrepidity, clothed with such power and authority, and
assured of success:

and they did as the Lord had commanded; they demanded in his name the
dismission of the children of Israel, and upon his requiring a miracle
to confirm their mission, wrought one as follows:

and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and it became a serpent: or
a "dragon", as the Septuagint version; this word is sometimes used of
great whales, [Gen 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#021.md) and of the
crocodile, [Eze 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003.md) and it is very
likely the crocodile is meant here, as Dr. Lightfoot (q) thinks; since
this was frequent in the Nile, the river of Egypt, where the Hebrew
infants had been cast, and into whose devouring jaws they fell, and
which also was an Egyptian deity (r). Though no mention is made of
Pharaoh's demanding a miracle, yet no doubt he did, as the Lord had
intimated he would, and without which it can hardly be thought it would
be done; and Artapanus (s), an Heathen writer, expressly asserts it; for
he says,"when the king required of Moses to do some sign or wonder, the
rod which he had he cast down, and it became a serpent, to the amazement
of all, and then took it by its tail and it be came a rod again;''which
is a testimony from an Heathen of the truth of this miracle.

[Exodus 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 7:11</span></span>

Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers,.... The cunning
men and wizards, a sort of jugglers and deceivers, who pretended to
great knowledge of things, to discover secrets, tell fortunes, and
predict things to come, and by legerdemain tricks, and casting a mist
before people's eyes, pretended to do very wonderful and amazing things;
and therefore Pharaoh sent for these, to exercise their art and cunning,
and see if they could not vie with Moses and Aaron:

now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their
enchantments; or by their secret wiles and juggles, making things seem
to appear to the sight when they did not really, but by dazzling the
eyes of men by their wicked and diabolical art, they fancied they saw
things which they did not; for the word has the signification of flames
of fire, or of a flaming sword, or lance, which being brandished to and
fro dazzles the sight. The Targum of Jonathan gives the names of two of
these magicians, whom he calls Jannes and Jambres, as does the apostle;
see Gill on [Ti2 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#008). Josephus (t.md)
calls these magicians of Egypt priests, and Artapanus (u) says, they
were priests that lived about Memphis. According to the Arabs (w), the
name of the place where they lived was Ausana, a city very ancient and
pleasant, called the city of the magicians, which lay to the east of the
Nile: their name in the Hebrew language is either from a word which
signifies a style, or greying tool, as Fuller (x) thinks, because in
their enchantments they used superstitious characters and figures; or,
as Saadiah Gaon (y), from two words, the one signifying a "hole", and
the other "stopped"; because they bored a hole in a tree to put
witchcrafts into it, and stopped it up, and then declared what should
be, or they had to say.

[Exodus 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 7:12</span></span>

For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents,.... That
is, they seemed to be so, as Josephus (z) expresses it, but not really,
in which he is followed by many; though some think that the devil
assisted in this affair, and in an instant, as soon as the rods were
cast down, removed them and put real serpents in their room:

but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods; that is, the serpent that
Aaron's rod was turned into, swallowed up the rods of the magicians,
which never were otherwise than rods only in appearance; or if real
serpents were put in the room of them, these were devoured by his
serpent called his rod, because it was before turned into a serpent, as
Aben Ezra observes; though the Targums of Jonathan, Jarchi, and R.
Jeshua, suppose this was done after the serpent became a rod again;
which makes the miracle the greater and more wonderful, that a rod
should devour other rods; and supposing them real serpents, this was
what the magicians could not make their rods do, and in which they were
outdone by Aaron.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">exo 7:13</span></span>

And he hardened Pharaoh's heart,.... Or, "notwithstanding the heart of
Pharaoh was hardened" (a); though he saw the rods of his magicians
devoured by rod; or "therefore" (b) his heart was hardened, because he
saw that the rods of his magicians became serpents as well as Aaron's;
in which there was a deception of sight, and which was suffered for the
hardening of his heart, there being other wonders and miracles to be
wrought, for showing forth the divine power, before Israel must be let
go:

that he hearkened not unto them; to Moses and Aaron, and comply with
their demand, to dismiss the people of Israel:

as the Lord had said; or foretold he would not.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 7:14</span></span>

And the Lord said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened,.... Or
"heavy" (c), dull and stupid, stiff and inflexible, cannot lift up his
heart, or find in his heart to obey the will of God:

he refuseth to let the people go; which was an instance and proof of the
hardness and heaviness of his heart, on which the above miracle had made
no impression, to regard what God by his ambassadors had required of
him.

[Exodus 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 7:15</span></span>

Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning,.... The next morning, a time in
which the mind is most composed and sedate, and fit to attend to what
may be suggested:

lo, he goeth out unto the water; the river Nile, either to take his
morning's walk, and to refresh himself at the waterside, as the
Jerusalem Targum; or to observe divinations upon the water, as a
magician, as the Targum of Jonathan. So in the Talmud (d) it is said,
that the Pharaoh in the days of Moses was a magician. Or rather, as Aben
Ezra thinks, which he says is a custom of the kings of Egypt to this
day, to go out in the months of Tammuz and Ab, i.e. June, and July, when
the river increases, to observe how many degrees it has ascended, by
which the fruitfulness of the ensuing season was judged of. See Gill on
Or else he went to worship the rising sun, or the Nile, to pay his
morning devotions to it: for not only Jarchi, and other Jewish writers,
say it was their chief god, but Plutarch (e) also affirms, that nothing
was so much honoured with the Egyptians as the Nile; and both Theodoret
on this place, and Athanasius (f) elsewhere says, that they reckoned it
a god, and worshipped it as such; and it has been usual with other
nations to worship rivers, as Aelianus (g) reports:

and thou shall stand by the river's brink against he come; over against
the brink of the river Nile, in order to meet him:

and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand;
as a terror to Pharaoh, on sight of which he might be put in mind of
what had been done, and by means of which he might fear other wonders
would be wrought; by this it appears, that after the rod had been turned
into a serpent, it became a rod again, as it did at Horeb, [Exo
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#004.md). Moses having previous notice of
all this, shows the prescience of God, and his certain knowledge of
future contingent events.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">exo 7:16</span></span>

And thou shalt say unto him,.... Upon meeting him:

the Lord God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee; still appearing in
the character of the ambassador of Jehovah, the God of the children of
Israel:

saying, let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness; the
demand is once more renewed, before any punishment is inflicted for
refusal, that the patience and forbearance of God might be the more
visible, and his judgments appear the more righteous when inflicted, as
well as Pharaoh be left more inexcusable. The reason of the demand is
observed:

that they may serve me; keep a feast, and sacrifice to him, as is before
expressed, and the place where is pointed at:

in the wilderness; at Sinai, in Arabia, where were the mountains of
Sinai and Horeb; but the time of their service is not here expressed, as
elsewhere, namely, three days:

and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear; and obey the voice of the
Lord, upbraiding him with his disobedience, and the hardness of his
heart; but signifying it was not now too late, though it was advisable
to be quick, or the blow would be given, and the plagues inflicted.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 7:17</span></span>

Thus saith the Lord, in this thou shalt know that I am the Lord,.... By
the following instance of his power and vengeance:

behold, I will smite with the rod that is in my hand; which though in
the hand of Moses, [Exo 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#018.md) yet he
being his ambassador, and representing him, is said to be in the hand of
the Lord; and with this he threatens to smite

upon the waters which are in the river; the river Nile, and the canals
thereof:

and they shall be turned to blood; and if this river was their god, it
would abundantly appear that the God of the Hebrews was Jehovah, and
above all gods, and particularly above theirs.

And the fish that is in the river shall die,.... Their element being
changed, and they not able to live in any other but water:

and the river shall stink; with the blood, into which it should be
congealed, and with the putrefied bodies of fishes floating in it:

and the Egyptians shall loath to drink of the water of the river; the
very colour of it, looking like blood, would set them against it, and
create a nausea in them; or "shall be weary" (h), tired of drinking it
in a little time, through the loathsomeness of it; or be weary in
digging about it, [Exo 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#024.md) to get
some clear water to drink of; or in seeking to find out ways and methods
to cure the waters, that so they might be fit to drink of, as Jarchi
interprets it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">exo 7:19</span></span>

And the Lord spake unto Moses,.... Pharaoh still being obstinate, and
refusing to let the people go:

say unto Aaron, take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters
of Egypt; upon all of them in general, what were in the river Nile, or
derived from it, as follows:

upon their streams; the seven streams of the river Nile; see Gill on
[Isa 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#015.md).

upon their rivers; the canals that were cut out of the river Nile, for
the watering of their fields and gardens, for they had no other river:

and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of waters; which were dug
near the river, or to which pipes were laid to convey the water thither:

that they may become blood; and so not fit to drink:

and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt,

both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone; in which water were
kept in private houses, fetched from the river for the use of families;
all which were to be turned into blood everywhere, in all parts of the
land, and in all places mentioned, immediately upon Aaron's taking his
rod, and smiting the waters with it in that part of the river that was
before him.

[Exodus 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 7:20</span></span>

And Moses and Aaron did so, as the Lord commanded,.... Moses delivered
the rod to Aaron, who took it and went to the water side:

and he lift up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river; or
"in that river" (i), the river Nile, on the brink of which Pharaoh then
stood:

in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; his nobles
and courtiers who tended him in his walk to the water; for this was done
before he returned to his palace:

and all the waters that were in the river were turned into blood; not
only the face of the waters looked like blood, but they were really
turned into it; and not only the surface of the water, but all the water
that was in the river, wherever it flowed, and as far as it flowed in
the land of Egypt.

[Exodus 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 7:21</span></span>

And the fish that was in the river died,.... Which was a full proof that
the conversion of it into blood was real; for had it been only in
appearance, or the water of the river had only the colour of blood, and
looked like it, but was not really so, it would not have affected the
fishes, they would have lived as well as before; and this plague was the
greater affliction to the Egyptians, not as it affected their drink but
their food, fish [Num 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#005.md) being what
the common people chiefly lived upon; see Gill on [Isa
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#008.md) and the river stunk; the blood
into which it was turned being corrupted through the heat of the sun,
and the dead fishes swimming upon it being putrefied:

and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and they
had no other water to drink of (k); for rain seldom fell in Egypt,
though sometimes it did in some places; see Gill on [Zac
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#018.md). The water of the river Nile was
not only their common drink, but it was exceeding pleasant, and
therefore the loss of it was the greater; it was so remarkable for the
sweetness and delicacy of its taste, that in the time of Pescennius
Niger, when his soldiers murmured for want of wine, he is reported to
have answered them,"what! crave you wine, and have the water of the Nile
to drink?''which Mr. Maillett, who lived sixteen years consul for the
French nation at Grand Cairo, confirms, and says, that it is grown to be
a common proverb, that whoever has once tasted it will ever after pine
for it (l); with this compare [Jer
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#018.md),

and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt; in the river,
wherever it flowed, in all its streams and channels, and wherever any
water was collected out of it, or fetched from it, let it be in what
reservoir it would. This is the first plague executed on the Egyptians,
and a very righteous one by the law of retaliation for shedding the
blood of innocent babes, through casting them into this river; and this
will be the second and third vials of God's wrath, which will be poured
on antichrist, or mystical Egypt, who will have blood given to drink
because worthy, see [Rev 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#003.md).
Artapanus (m), an Heathen writer, bears testimony to this miracle,
though he does not so fully and clearly express it as it was; he says,"a
little after, that is, after the former miracle of the rod turned into a
serpent, the Nile, that river whose swelling waves overflow all Egypt,
was smitten with the rod; and the water being gathered and stagnated,
boiled up, and not only the fishes were destroyed, but the people
perished through thirst.''

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 7:22</span></span>

And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments,.... Who were
either in company with Pharaoh and his nobles, or were immediately sent
for to try their art, and confront Moses and Aaron with it; and who very
probably got a little water in a vessel, and by some juggling trick
imposing upon, and deceiving the sight of Pharaoh and his servants, made
it look like blood; and the devil might help them to a sufficient
quantity of blood, and discolour the water with it, and make it appear
as if it was blood, and which was a poor business; had they turned the
bloody river into water again, they would have equalled the miracle of
Moses and Aaron, and done some service to their country; but to deceive
the sight of people, or to spoil a small quantity of water that was
good, by mixing it with blood, was but a mean and unworthy action.
Should it be asked from whence they had this water, when all was turned
into blood? it may be answered, either from Goshen, as the Targum of
Jonathan, the waters of the Hebrews not being affected with this plague:
though Aben Ezra thinks they were; or from the sea, as Theodoret; but
both these places were too far distant to fetch water from, in the time
that Pharaoh stayed here before his return home: rather therefore this
water was had from some habitation of the Israelites in the city near at
hand, where Pharaoh lived, or was dug for immediately by the magicians,
as in [Exo 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#024.md) or it may be that all
the waters were not immediately turned into blood, but successively and
gradually, first the river, and then its streams, &c. so that there
might be near at hand a pool of water, not yet turned into blood, and a
vessel of water might be fetched from it, on which they exercised their
juggling art:

and Pharaoh's heart was hardened: by seeing his magicians do what was
similar to what Moses and Aaron had done; and therefore concluded that
it was not by the hand of God, but owing to a magic art they were
masters of, as his magicians were:

neither did he hearken unto them; to Moses and Aaron, and what they said
to him, to let the people go:

as the Lord had said; had before told he would not hearken to them, [Exo
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#004.md).

And Pharaoh turned, and went into his house,.... Turned away from Moses
and Aaron, and turned back from the river to which he came, and went to
his palace in the city; it being perhaps now about dinner time, when all
before related had passed:

neither did he set his heart to this also: had no regard to this miracle
of turning the waters into blood, as well as he had none to the rod
being turned into a serpent, and devouring the rods of the magicians; he
neither considered the one nor the other, or seriously and closely
thought of this, any more than of the other.

And all the Egyptians digged round about the river,.... On each side of
it, in order to get clear water; and Aben Ezra thinks the Hebrews also,
who were affected with this, and the two following plagues, the frogs
and lice: but it is much more reasonable to conclude that they were free
from them all. This they did

for water to drink: for there was none in the river, streams, ponds and
pools, or in vessels, in which they used to reserve it, and therefore
could come at none but by digging; and whether they obtained any in that
way is not said:

for they could not drink of the waters of the river; it being turned
into blood, and stunk so exceedingly; and though they might strain it,
and make it in some measure, drinkable, and might make use of the juice
of herbs, and other things, to extinguish their thirst, and the better
sort might have a stock of wine, yet multitudes must be greatly
distressed, and many perish, as Philo (n) the Jew says they did.

And seven days were fulfilled,.... Or there were full seven days, a
whole week:

after that the Lord had smitten the river, and turned it into blood;
here the miracle is ascribed to him; Moses and Aaron, and the rod they
used, were only instruments, nothing short of almighty power could do
such a miracle; it seems this lasted seven days at least. It began, as
Bishop Usher (o) computes it, on the eighteen day of the sixth month, or
Adar, part of February and part of March, and ended the twenty fifth of
the same. It is not said that Pharaoh requested to have it removed,
though Philo (p) says he did; his stubborn heart not being humbled
enough as yet to ask such a favour, and therefore perhaps it was taken
off without asking for it, to make way for another.
