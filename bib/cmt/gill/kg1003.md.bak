INTRODUCTION TO 1 KINGS 3

This chapter relates the marriage of Solomon with Pharaoh's daughter,
[Kg1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#001.md); his piety and devotion, [Kg1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#002.md); his prayer for wisdom and
understanding, which was acceptable to God, who promised to grant his
request, with an addition to it, [Kg1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#005.md); an instance and proof of the
wisdom given him in determining a case between two harlots brought
before him, which greatly raised his reputation, and gave him reverence
among his people, [Kg1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#016.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 3:1</span></span>

And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt,.... Pharaoh was a
common name of the kings of Egypt, of whom no mention is made in
Scripture from the times of Moses until this time; which may seem
strange, when it is considered that that kingdom was a potent one, and
near the land of Canaan; but it was governed by a race of kings in this
period of time, of whom, as Diodorus Siculus (i) says, there is nothing
worthy of relation. The name of this Pharaoh, according to Eupolemus
(k), an Heathen writer, was Vaphres; for he says, that David contracted
a friendship with this king, and he relates some letters which passed
between him and Solomon, concerning sending him workmen for the building
of the temple, which are still preserved; but Calvisius (l) thinks it
was Sesostris; what this affinity was is next observed:

and took Pharaoh's daughter: that is, married her; who, according to Ben
Gersom, was proselyted first to the Jewish religion; which is very
probable, or otherwise it can hardly be thought Solomon would marry her;
and as the forty fifth psalm, [Psa
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#001.md), and the book of Canticles,
supposed to be written on that occasion, seem to confirm; to which may
be added, that it does not appear she ever enticed or drew him into
idolatry; for, of all the idols his wives drew him into the worship of,
no mention is made of any Egyptian deities. The Jews say (m) Rome was
built the same day Solomon married Pharaoh's daughter, but without
foundation: this was not Solomon's first wife; he was married to Naamah
the Ammonitess before he was king, for he had Rehoboam by her a year
before that for Solomon reigned only forty years, and Rehoboam, who
succeeded him, was forty one years of age when he began to reign, [Kg1
11:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#041.md);

and brought her into the city of David; the fort of Zion:

until he had made an end of building his own house: which was thirteen
years in building, and now seems to have been begun, [Kg1
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#001.md);

and the house of the Lord; the temple, which according: to the Jewish
chronology (n), was begun building before his marriage of Pharaoh's
daughter, and was seven years in building; and therefore this marriage
must be in the fourth year of his reign; for then he began to build the
temple, [Kg1 6:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#037.md); and so it must be,
since Shimei lived three years in Jerusalem before he was put to death,
after which this marriage was, [Kg1
2:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#037.md);

and the wall of Jerusalem round about; all which he built by raising a
levy on the people, [Kg1 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#015.md); and
when these buildings were finished, he built a house for his wife, but
in the mean while she dwelt in the city of David.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 3:2</span></span>

Only the people sacrificed in high places,.... On the tops of their
houses, on hills and mountains, and particularly at the high place in
Gibeon, where the tabernacle was:

because there was no house built unto the name of the Lord until those
days; to which they were obliged to repair as afterwards, and there
offer their sacrifices, as the Lord had commanded, [Deu
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#005.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 3:3</span></span>

And Solomon loved the Lord,.... The worship of the Lord, as the Targum:
and which he showed by

walking in the statutes of David his father; in which his father walked,
which were the statutes of the Lord, or which he exhorted him to walk
in, and were the same, [Kg1 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#003.md);

only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places; besides that at
Gibeon, which it seems David did not.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 3:4</span></span>

And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there,.... About four or five
miles from Jerusalem; See Gill on [Kg1
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#028.md);

for that was the great high place; not that the place itself might be
higher than others that were used; but here were the tabernacle of
Moses, and the altar; so that it was a more dignified place, and more
sacred because of them:

a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar; the brazen
altar of burnt offerings there; not at one time, but on several days
successively; though Jarchi says on one day; and which was a prodigious
number, never was known the like, unless at the dedication of the
temple, [Kg1 8:63](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#063.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 3:5</span></span>

In Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night,.... This was
not a common natural dream, but an extraordinary, divine, and
supernatural one, a prophetic dream, a night vision, such as God used to
speak in to his prophets; in which he had the full use of his reasoning
powers, was under divine impressions, and in a spiritual frame of mind,
and in the exercise of grace; it was not a mere dream that the Lord did
appear to him, but he really did appear to him while sleeping and
dreaming, by some display of his glory in some way or another:

and God said, ask what I shall give thee; he did not hereby dream that
God said to him, but he really did say this; bid him ask what he would
and it should be given him; he knew what he designed to give, but he
would have it asked of him, as he will be inquired of by all his people
to do that for them which he has intended and provided for them; and it
is encouragement enough for them to ask, since he has promised to give.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 3:6</span></span>

And Solomon said,.... In his dream; not that he dreamt he said, when he
did not; but he really said, as follows:

thou hast showed unto thy servant David my father great mercy; bestowed
many favours and blessings upon him, both temporal and spiritual:

according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and
in uprightness of heart with thee; in the truth of doctrine and worship,
according to the revealed will and word of God, and which he observed
with great strictness, living soberly, righteously, and godly, though
not without failings and imperfections, yet with great integrity and
sincerity; and this holy walk of his was not the cause of God's showing
mercy to him, nor was it in proportion to that, but what he was
influenced to by the mercy that was shown him:

and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him
a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day; a son to be his
successor, meaning himself; which was an additional favour to all the
rest, and was in reserve, and now bestowed, as time had made to appear.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 3:7</span></span>

And now, O Lord my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David
my father,.... Removed by death, in whose stead he reigned by the
appointment of God, and through his overruling providence,
notwithstanding the attempts made to prevent it, and therefore to God he
ascribes it:

and I am but a little child; not in age and stature, but in knowledge
and understanding; for though his father called him a wise man, and he
was judged so by others, and really was one, yet in his own opinion and
thought of himself such was his modesty and humility, that he was but a
child as to his intellectual powers and capacity for government: some
understand this of age; and the Jews commonly say he was but twelve
years of age when he was anointed king, which they reckon thus; that he
was born at the time that Ammon ravished Tamar, two years after which
was Absalom's sheep shearing, when he slew Amnon, on which he fled to
Geshur, and was there three years; here are five years; he returned
thence and was at Jerusalem two years; lo, seven years; he rebelled and
was slain, and after that there was a famine of three years, which make
ten; and in the year following David numbered the people, which was nine
or ten months in doing; the next year he died, which was the fortieth of
his reign, in all twelve years; so reckon Jarchi and Kimchi; and
Eupolemus, an Heathen writer (n), is express for it, who says, that
David, when he had reigned forty years, delivered up the kingdom to
Solomon his son, being then twelve years of age, which he must receive
from the tradition of the Jews; the same is said by several of the
ancient fathers, as Ignatius (o) and Jerom (p); but this cannot be fact;
for, if so, his son Rehoboam must be born to him when he was but eleven
years of age; See Gill on [Kg1 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#005.md); it
is best therefore to interpret this of the sense he had of the weakness
of his understanding, and of his incapacity for government, as the next
clause explains it:

I know not how to go out or come in; in the administration of
government, to execute his office as a king, in allusion to shepherds,
as kings are sometimes called, going in and out before their sheep.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 3:8</span></span>

And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast
chosen,.... To be his special and peculiar people above all people on
the earth; this is not to be understood locally, though Jerusalem, where
his palace was, was in the middle of the land; but of the exercise of
his office, he being placed over the people, and among them, and having
the care and inspection of them:

a great people, that cannot be numbered and counted for multitude; being
for number as the stars in the sky, and as the sand upon the seashore,
as had been promised.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 3:9</span></span>

Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart, to judge thy
people,.... Not an understanding of things spiritual, nor of things
natural, though both were given him, but of things political, what
related to the civil government, that he might be able to judge or rule
the people of Israel in the best manner:

that I may discern between good and bad; not merely between moral good
and evil, of which he had a discernment; but between right and wrong in
any case or controversy that came before him between man and man, that
so he might be able to pass a right sentence, and do justice to every
one:

for who is able to judge this thy so great a people? who are so very
numerous, and have so many causes to be heard and and those many of them
very intricate and difficult; so that no man is equal to such arduous
work, unless he has more than an ordinary capacity given him by the
Lord.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 3:10</span></span>

And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.
Understanding in the affairs of civil government; since he had respect
not to his own private benefit and advantage, but the good of the people
he governed, and the honour and glory of God, who had set him over them,
they being his chosen people, and whose vicegerent he was.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 3:11</span></span>

And God said unto him,.... Being yet in a dream:

because thou hast asked this thing; wisdom for government:

and hast not asked for thyself long life; which is naturally desired by
men, and always reckoned a great temporal blessing, and especially to be
wished for by a king living in great pomp and splendour:

neither hast asked riches for thyself; to support his grandeur; for
though David his father had left him much, yet not for himself, but for
the building of the temple:

nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; victory over them, and to have
it in his power to take away their lives when he pleased; which kings,
and especially tyrants, are desirous of, such as are ambitious, haughty,
and revengeful:

but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment; where the
right of a cause lay, that so he might make a right judgment of it, and
pass a righteous sentence, a sentence not to the injury of any.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg1 3:12</span></span>

Behold, I have done according to thy words,.... Expressed in his
request: he not only promised he would grant him it, but he had already
done it, or at least had begun to do it:

lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; had greatly
increased his wisdom and understanding in things political, things
respecting civil government, and also in things natural, in the
knowledge of the things of nature as appears from [Kg1
4:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#033.md); and of the arts and sciences:

so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall
any arise like unto thee: which some restrain to kings, and to the kings
of Israel; that there were none of the kings before him, as Saul and
David, like him for wisdom, nor any of the kings of Judah and Israel
after him; but it may include all men of all nations in the world, since
he is said to be wiser than all men; and some other nations, and
particular men of other nations, famous for wisdom, are expressly
mentioned as inferior to him, [Kg1
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#030.md); but then this must be understood
of men since the fall; for Adam, doubtless, had a larger stock of
knowledge and understanding in his state of innocence than ever Solomon
had; and it must be restrained to political and natural knowledge; for,
as for divine knowledge, Kimchi excepts Moses; and we may well except
the apostles of Christ for spiritual and evangelical knowledge; and as
for our Lord, the antitype of Solomon, he is greater than him in all
kind of knowledge, all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge being hid
in him, see [Mat 12:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#042.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 3:13</span></span>

And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked,.... That is,
intended to give him, and now promised it, and was about to bestow it on
him:

both riches and honour; the former through the presents and tribute of
the nations about him, and his trading to foreign parts; and the latter
chiefly through his wisdom, the fame of which was spread everywhere:

so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy
days; that is, none like him for riches and honour among all the kings
of the neighbouring nations so long as he lived; though there might be
kings in later times as rich, or richer than he, as Croesus, Alexander,
&c. but then not so honourable as he; so, putting both together, there
were no kings like him before or after, and especially if wisdom be
added to them, as in [Ch2 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#012.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 3:14</span></span>

And if thou wilt walk in my ways,.... Prescribed and directed to in his
word,

to keep my statutes and my commandments; ceremonial, moral, and
judicial:

as thy father David did walk; which Solomon himself had observed, [Kg1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#006.md); and whose walk was worthy of his
imitation:

then I will lengthen thy days; the other promises of riches and honour
are absolute, but this of long life conditional, depending upon his holy
walk and conversation; and hence, because he failed in this the Jews
observe he did not attain to long life, dying, as they suppose, at fifty
two years of age; which is grounded on a wrong hypothesis, that he was
but twelve years of age when he he began to reign, and he reigned forty
years, as before observed.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 3:15</span></span>

And Solomon awoke, and, behold, it was a dream,.... Not that it was
nothing but a dream, a natural one, a vain and empty one, but a divine
and supernatural one, a dream of prophecy, as the Jews call it, or a
prophetic dream; a true one, which had its fall accomplishment in him,
the truth of which he perceived as soon as he awoke; for he found
himself possessed of such a measure of wisdom and knowledge he never had
before, which occasioned the thanksgiving and joy next expressed:

and he came to Jerusalem; from Gibeon, accompanied by his nobles and
servants:

and stood before the ark of the covenant the Lord; which was in a tent
David had pitched for it there, [Sa2
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#017.md); here he stood with holy
reverence, as in the presence of the Lord, and as a servant of his, to
minister to him, and as a worshipper of him, with a heart full of
gratitude for the great things he had done for him, and promised to him:

and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings; by way of
thankfulness for his quiet settlement in the for the Lord's appearance
to him at Gibeon, and what he had already given, and promised to give:

and made a feast to all his servants; in a way of joy and gladness for
the above layouts; this feast was either the part of the peace offerings
he offered, which belonged to the offerer to eat with his friends, or
this was a special feast made at his own palace for his courtiers.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 3:16</span></span>

Then came there two women that were harlots unto the king,.... The same
day, as Abarbinel thinks, the night before which the Lord had appeared
to Solomon; this came to pass through the providence of God, that there
should be immediately an instance and proof of the wisdom and
understanding the Lord had given to Solomon; these women, according to
the Targum, were victuallers or inn keepers; and so Ben Gersom thinks
they were sellers of food, as Rahab; though he observes it is possible
they might, prostitute themselves: this may be said in their favour,
that common prostitutes do not usually bear children, or, when they do,
take no care of them, have no affection for them, and much less are fond
of them, as these seem to be; but, on the other hand, no mention being
made of their husbands, and living together in one house, and alone, and
being impudent, brawling, and litigious, give great suspicion of the
truth of the character they bear in our version and others:

and stood before him; to lay their case before him, and each plead their
own cause; it may be, it had been tried in another court before, and
could not be determined, and so was brought to the king; and, if so, the
wisdom of Solomon was the more conspicuous, in deciding it in the manner
he did.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 3:17</span></span>

And the one woman said,.... Who was the plaintiff:

O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; pointing to the
defendant, who stood by her:

and I was delivered of a child with her in the house; she being present
at the delivery, and she only, as it should seem.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg1 3:18</span></span>

And it came to pass, the third day after I was delivered,.... Of a
child, as before expressed:

that this woman was delivered also; of another child; and being both of
the same sex, both sons, as afterwards appears; and being so nearly of
an age, it was difficult to distinguish them;

and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house,

save we two in the house; so that in this trial no evidences could be
produced on either side.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 3:19</span></span>

And this woman's child died in the night,.... Whether the same night
following the day it was born is not certain;

because she overlaid it; or laid upon it, being heavy through sleep, and
not knowing what she did, turned herself upon it, and smothered it;
because it had no previous illness, or any marks of any disease it could
be thought to die of, and perhaps there might be some of its being
overlaid.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg1 3:20</span></span>

And she arose at midnight,.... Perceiving what she had done, that she
had overlaid her child, and it was dead; either through fear of
punishment inflicted on persons thus negligent, or because of the
disgrace of it, taking no more care of her child, she made use of the
following stratagem:

and took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept; this served
to puzzle the cause, for how could she know what she did when she was
asleep? this she could not prove, it was only conjecture:

and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom; where she
found it in the morning; but still what proof was there that it was the
other woman's, and not her own, that lay dead in her bosom?

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 3:21</span></span>

And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck,.... As she used to
do:

behold, it was dead; her own child, as she thought at first:

but when I had considered it in the morning; it was towards morning, or
just at break of day, when she arose to suckle it, and found it dead:
but when it was broad day, and the light of the morning was increased,
she more narrowly viewed it, and by its features, or some marks she had
observed;

behold, it was not my son which I did bear: she was fully satisfied it
was not her own child, but another.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 3:22</span></span>

And the other woman said,.... The defendant:

nay, but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son; she denied what
the other said, but offered nothing in proof of it:

and this said; she who was the plaintiff replied in the same language:

no: but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son; without being
able to add anything in confirmation of what she had deposed:

thus they spake before the king; several times, over and over again,
what is before expressed, having nothing to produce on either side in
proof of their assertions; so that it was very difficult to determine to
whom the living child belonged.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 3:23</span></span>

Then said the king,.... As judge, summing up what had been said on both
sides, which were only bare assertions without proof; the one affirming
what the other denied, and the other denying what the other affirmed:

the one saith, this is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead;

and the other saith nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the
living; this he repeated to show to all present that no determination
could be made by what had been said on each side, and that some other
method must be taken.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 3:24</span></span>

And the king said, bring me a sword,.... The design of which might not
at first appear to the court, and it might be thought strange, and
greatly wondered at: what should be the meaning of it:

and they brought a sword before the king; his commands were obeyed.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 3:25</span></span>

And the king said,.... To one of his officers:

divide the living child in two; not that he meant it should be actually
done, though it might at first be thought he really intended it, and so
strike the minds of some with horror, as it did, however, the mother;
but he ordered this, to try the affections of the women, and thereby
come to the true knowledge of the affair; though, some think he knew it
before by their countenances and manner of speech, but that he was
desirous all present might see it, and be satisfied of it:

and give half to the one, and half to the other; since both claimed it.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#026.md)

Then spake the woman, whose the living child was, unto the king,.... In
haste, and with great vehemency, lest the executioner should at once
dispatch it:

(for her bowels yearned upon her son); not being able to bear to see his
life taken away:

and she said, O my lord: or, "on me (q), my lord"; let the sin, the lie
that I have told, be on me, and the punishment of it; she rather chose
to be reckoned a liar, and to endure any punishment such an offence
deserved, than that her child should be cut asunder:

give her the living child, and in no wise slay it; being willing to part
with her interest in it, rather than it should be put to death:

but the other said, let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it; for
as she knew it was not her own, she had no affection for it, nor desire
to have it; chose rather to be clear of the expense of keeping and
nursing it, and would, by its being put to death, be avenged of her
adversary, who had brought this cause before the king.

\(q\) "in me", Montanus; so Abarbinel.

Then the king answered and said, give her the living child,

and in no wise slay it,.... That is, to her who desired it might not be
slain, but rather be given to her who had no right to it:

she is the mother thereof; which might be strongly concluded from her
compassion for it, her eagerness and earnestness to have its life
spared, and from the indifference of the other, yea, from her cruelty
and barbarity in moving to have it divided.

And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged,.... In
the above case; the decision of it was divulged throughout the land, and
the fame of it was spread everywhere:

and they feared the king; reverenced him as a wise, judicious, and
faithful king, and feared to do anything of a criminal nature, as
perceiving that he was so sagacious and penetrating, that he would
discover it quickly, and bring them to shame and punishment:

for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to do judgment; that God
had put more than ordinary wisdom into him, to make a right judgment in
causes that came before him, and finish them in the most just and
equitable manner.
