[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 30:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO 2 CHRONICLES 30

Hezekiah having consulted his nobles about keeping the passover the
second month, and determined upon it, sent messengers throughout Israel
and Judah, to acquaint them with it, at which some mocked, and others
seriously attended to it, [Ch2 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#001.md) so
it was celebrated in a solemn manner, though some were not qualified for
it according to the law, and for whose pardon Hezekiah prayed, and it
was granted, [Ch2 30:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#013.md), also the
feast of unleavened bread was kept seven days, and a festival of seven
days more was likewise observed with great joy and gladness, [Ch2
30:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#021.md).

[2 Chronicles 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 30:1</span></span>

And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah,.... Sent messengers to them,
not only to the subjects of his own kingdom, Judah, but to all the
Israelites that dwelt in it, who were come thither for the sake of
religion, and the worship of God:

and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh; which are put for all
the ten tribes, as appears from [Ch2
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#010.md) and are distinguished from
Israel in the preceding clause:

that they should come to the house of the Lord at Jerusalem; not that he
laid his commands upon them to come, they not being his subjects,
namely, those of the ten tribes; but he hereby admonished them of their
duty, and gave them a kind invitation, signifying the doors of the
temple were open for them, and they were welcome to come thither:

to keep the passover unto the Lord God of Israel; to the glory of his
name, who was the common Lord of them all, and whose command it was to
keep the passover, and that at Jerusalem, and nowhere else, see [Deu
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#001.md).

[2 Chronicles 30:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 30:2</span></span>

For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the
congregation in Jerusalem,.... He and his nobles, and the great
sanhedrim or senate of the nation, had consulted together:

to keep the passover in the second month; in the month Ijar, as the
Targum, because they could not keep it in the first month, as it should
have been kept, according to the law of God, for the reasons following.

[2 Chronicles 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 30:3</span></span>

For they could not keep it at the time,.... In the month Nisan, as the
Targum adds, on the fourteenth day of the month, as the law enjoined,
because the cleansing of the temple was not finished until the sixteenth
day, see [Ch2 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#017.md) and, besides this,
two other reasons follow:

because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently; that is,
a sufficient number of them were not sanctified, to slay all the
passover lambs the people that came to the feast would want:

neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem; they
had no notice of it, nor summons for it; and it was required that, at
such a time, all the males in the land should appear at Jerusalem; but
this custom having been long disused, it required time to acquaint them
of the revival of it.

[2 Chronicles 30:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 30:4</span></span>

And the thing pleased the king, and all the congregation. They all
unanimously agreed to it, and determined it should be done.

[2 Chronicles 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 30:5</span></span>

So they established a decree, to make proclamation throughout all
Israel,.... Passed a vote, that heralds should be appointed and sent to
proclaim it throughout the land, that all might know it, and none plead
ignorance:

from Beersheba even to Dan; the one being the southern and the other the
northern boundary of the whole land of Israel:

that they should come to keep the passover unto the Lord God of Israel
at Jerusalem: the only proper place where it was to be kept:

for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was written;
as prescribed in the law those of the ten tribes had not observed it
from the time of the schism of Jeroboam, and many in the kingdom of
Judah had neglected it, at least had not kept it as the law required;
for the phrase which we render "of a long time" rather respects a
multitude of persons than length of time, who had been very deficient in
their observance of this ordinance; the Targum is, that"many had not
done it in its time, in Nisan,''and suggests that it was kept twice this
year, first in Nisan by a few, and now again in the second month Ijar,
and which is the sense of some Talmudic writers (p), but has no
foundation in the text.

\(p\) T. Bab. Sanhedrin, fol. 12. 2.

[2 Chronicles 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 30:6</span></span>

So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes
throughout all Israel and Judah,.... Both through the kingdoms of the
ten tribes of Israel, and the kingdom of the two tribes of Judah and
Benjamin:

and according to the commandment of the king, saying; so they were
ordered by the king to say, when they delivered the letters which by the
king's commandment they carried; or this was the purport of them, as
follows, especially of those that were sent to the ten tribes:

ye children of Israel, turn again unto the Lord God of Abraham, Isaac,
and Israel; from whom they had revolted, and from whose worship they had
departed, by setting up and serving the calves at Dan and Bethel:

and he will return to the remnant of you that are escaped out of the
hand of the king of Assyria; Pul and Tiglathpileser, who had both
invaded their land, and the latter had taken many of their cities, and
carried the inhabitants captive, [Kg2
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#019.md).

[2 Chronicles 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 30:7</span></span>

And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which
trespassed against the Lord God of their fathers,.... By worshipping the
calves, and neglecting the service of God in the temple at Jerusalem;
the Targum is,"which acted deceitfully with the Word of the Lord their
God:"

who therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see; some part of the
land of Israel being already made desolate by the kings of Assyria,
which was very visible.

[2 Chronicles 30:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 30:8</span></span>

Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were,.... Obstinate and
refractory, like heifers unaccustomed to the yoke, which draw back from
it, and will not submit to it:

but yield yourselves unto the Lord; be subject unto him, or "give the
hand" (q) to him, as a token of subjection and homage, or of entering
into covenant with him, promising for the future to serve and obey him:

and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever; set
apart for worship and service, until the Messiah should come:

and serve the Lord your God; there, in the temple, according to his
prescribed will:

that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you; which had
already broke out, in suffering the Assyrians to invade their land, and
distress them.

[2 Chronicles 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 30:9</span></span>

For if ye turn again unto the Lord,.... To the fear or worship of the
Lord, as the Targum:

your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that
lead them captive, so that they shall come again into this land; who had
been carried away by Tiglathpileser, see [Psa
106:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#046.md),

for the Lord your God is gracious and merciful; so he had proclaimed his
name, as they must know, [Exo 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006.md),

and will not turn away his face from you; in wrath and anger; or
withdraw his Shecaniah from you, as the Targum; his gracious and
glorious presence:

if ye return unto him; his fear and worship, as the same paraphrase.

[2 Chronicles 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 30:10</span></span>

So the posts passed from city to city, through the country of Ephraim
and Manasseh, even unto Zebulun,.... Through all the ten tribes, not
being hindered or forbid by Hoshea king of Israel, who was one of the
best of their kings, and was very willing his people should go and
worship at Jerusalem if they thought fit; so that they had no excuse to
make, as before, that they were forbid by their king going thither; and
which it is very probable Hezekiah knew, and therefore took the freedom
to send posts throughout his kingdom:

but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them; the messengers that
brought the letters, the contents of which they despised, and paid no
regard to; this was the behaviour of many, and probably of the greater
part, but not of all, as follows.

[2 Chronicles 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 30:11</span></span>

Nevertheless, divers of Asher, and Manasseh, and of Zebulun, humbled
themselves,.... Confessed their idolatries and impieties, and expressed
sorrow and repentance for them, and were willing to obey the commands of
God, and attend his worship and ordinances:

and came to Jerusalem; to keep the passover.

[2 Chronicles 30:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 30:12</span></span>

Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart,.... To make
them unanimous in this service, hearty and willing to it, to a man,
which was owing to the power and efficacy of divine grace:

to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the
Lord; to keep the passover, which they did not only in obedience to
their superiors, and their orders, but considering these as agreeable to
the word and will of God.

[2 Chronicles 30:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 30:13</span></span>

And there assembled at Jerusalem much people,.... Out of the several
tribes:

to keep the feast of unleavened bread: the passover, which was eaten
with unleavened bread:

in the second month: the month Ijar:

a very great congregation; such as had not been seen on such an occasion
for many years.

[2 Chronicles 30:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 30:14</span></span>

And they arose,.... Before they slew and ate the passover:

and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem; which Ahaz had set up
in every corner of Jerusalem, to offer sacrifices upon, [Ch2
28:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#024.md).

and all the altars for incense took they away; for as there were some to
offer sacrifices on, there were others to burn incense upon, not to the
Lord, but to idols, as the Targum adds:

and cast them into the brook Kidron; having reduced them to dust and
ashes, see [Ch2 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#016.md).

[2 Chronicles 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 30:15</span></span>

Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second
month,.... For though they could not keep it in the month in which it
should have been kept, for the reasons before given, yet they kept it on
the day of the month in which it was observed:

and the priests and the Levites were ashamed; of their negligence and
backwardness to service, and to fit themselves for it, when they saw the
people so forward and ready to attend to it:

and they sanctified themselves; by washing their bodies and their
garments:

and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the Lord; to be
offered up on the altar of burnt offerings, to expiate their own sins,
and the sins of the people; though some take these to be the passover
offerings; but they were not offered until the fifteenth day, and
besides were peace offerings, mentioned [Ch2
30:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#022.md), rather these were the daily
sacrifices.

[2 Chronicles 30:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 30:16</span></span>

And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law
of Moses the man of God,.... The priests in their place, and the Levites
in theirs, in which they were ordered to stand when they offered
sacrifice:

the priests sprinkled the blood, which they received of the hand of the
Levites; the blood either of the burnt offerings before mentioned, or of
the passover lambs, which the Levites slew, and received the blood of
them in basins; and which the priests took of them, and sprinkled, not
on the door posts of houses, as in Egypt, but on the altar round about,
and which none but priests might do, [Lev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#005.md).

[2 Chronicles 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 30:17</span></span>

For there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified,.... Or
purified from uncleanness, contracted either by idolatry, or through
such things which, according to the ceremonial law, made them unclean,
and from which they had not now time to cleanse themselves according to
the law:

therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for
everyone that was not clean, to sanctify them unto the Lord; this they
did for the masters of families, who were ceremonially unclean, who
otherwise might have killed their passover lambs themselves, see [Exo
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#006.md), but now the Levites did it for
them, that their passovers might be sanctified and consecrated to the
Lord; for, as Philo the Jew says (r), one day in a year the whole
sacrificed, everyone acted as a priest, and brought and slew his own
sacrifice, meaning at the passover.

\(r\) De Vita Mosis, l. 3. p. 686. & de Decalogo, p. 766.

[2 Chronicles 30:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 30:18</span></span>

For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim and Manasseh,
Issachar and Zebulun,.... All which were of the ten tribes, where
idolatry had prevailed for a long time:

had not cleansed themselves; from impurity contracted by idolatry and
other things:

yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written; because
they ate it in their uncleanness, which was not according to the law,
that required that such should be clean that ate of any holy things, see
[Joh 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#028.md) but since these people came
a great way off, and there was no deferring it to another month, the
king chose rather they should be admitted to eat of it, though in their
uncleanness:

but Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, the good Lord pardon everyone;
God, who is gracious and merciful, and of his goodness, grace, and
mercy, forgive such who, though ceremonially unclean, ate of the
passover, and especially since they were sincere and cordial in their
services; and therefore he hoped that this breach of the ceremonial law
would not be laid to their charge. Goodness is such a well known
attribute of God, that the very Heathens ascribe it to their deities;
hence we read of a temple of the "good god", the gods being the givers
of good things to men; Jupiter, or Jove, the supreme god, is supposed to
be meant (s).

[2 Chronicles 30:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch2 30:19</span></span>

That prepareth his heart to seek God, the Lord God of his fathers,....
Who was heartily desirous of worshipping God, and observing his
ordinances, which had been enjoined their fathers, and they had kept;
though Aben Ezra, as Kimchi observes, refers this to Hezekiah:

whose whole heart he directed, or prepared to seek the Lord, &c. by
prayer and supplication for everyone of the said persons:

though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the
sanctuary: according to the ceremonial law, which the service of the
temple required; since, though they were attended with a ceremonial
impurity, had a moral purity, and their hearts were right with God.

[2 Chronicles 30:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 30:20</span></span>

And the Lord hearkened to Hezekiah,.... Heard his prayer, and accepted
of it, and granted what he desired:

and healed his people; that is, forgave their sins, as Kimchi interprets
it; forgiveness being expressed by healing, for which he refers to [Psa
41:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#004.md) to which may be added [Psa
103:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#003.md) and which was known either by a
prophet sent to declare it, or by not punishing them for their offence.

[2 Chronicles 30:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 30:21</span></span>

And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast
of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness,.... Which, according
to the law of Moses, were always to follow the passover, [Exo
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#018.md).

and the Levites and the priests praised the Lord day by day, singing
with loud instruments unto the Lord; or instruments of strength (t); so
called not from the matter of them, or manner in which they were made,
but either from the sound of them, as our version, or from the strength
and power of God, which they set forth in praise; the Targum is,"with
instruments of praise,''and so the word is sometimes used, see [Psa
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#002.md) compared with [Mat
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#016.md), the priests blew with trumpets,
and the Levites played on harps, psalteries, &c. and this they did every
day when the sacrifices were offered, during the seven days of
unleavened bread.

[2 Chronicles 30:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch2 30:22</span></span>

And Hezekiah spake comfortably to all the Levites,.... Or "to the heart"
(u) of them, such things as were very encouraging to them to go on in
the work and worship of God, commending their singing, exhorting them to
diligence in instructing the people, promising them his favour and
protection:

even those that taught the good knowledge of the Lord; who instructed
the people well in his word, worship, and ordinances; though some
restrain this to their skill in singing the praises of God, both vocally
and instrumentally, and their abilities and diligence in teaching
others:

and they did eat throughout the feast: or did eat the feast; that is,
the sacrifices of it; not the Levites only, but the king, and all the
congregation:

offering peace offerings; part of which belonged to the Lord, another
part to the priests, and a third to the offerers, on which they feasted
with their friends; and this they did throughout all the seven days of
the feast:

and making confession to the Lord God of their fathers; confessing their
sins of omission and commission they had been guilty of; owning the
goodness, grace, and mercy of God towards them; blessing and praising
his name for the restoration of his worship and ordinances among them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch2 30:23</span></span>

And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days,.... They
consulted among themselves, and with the king and his nobles about it,
who all agreed to it:

and they kept other seven days with gladness; not altogether in the same
manner they had kept the preceding seven days; they did not slay and eat
passover lambs, nor did they eat unleavened bread, but offered peace
offerings, and feasted upon them; and sung the praises of God, and
attended to the instructions of the priests and Levites, being in a very
agreeable frame of mind for religious exercises.

[2 Chronicles 30:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch2 30:24</span></span>

For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation one thousand
bullocks, and seven thousand sheep,.... He separated them, as Kimchi
interprets it, from his own herds and flocks; or out of his own
substance, at his own expense purchased them; or lifted them up, as the
word signifies, as heave offerings to the Lord; and gave them to the
people for thank offerings to feast upon:

and the princes gave to the congregation one thousand bullocks, and ten
thousand sheep: for the same purposes, following the king's example:

and a great number of priests sanctified themselves; besides those who
had before, that they might be fit to offer this great number of
sacrifices.

[2 Chronicles 30:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch2 30:25</span></span>

And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and Levites,.... The
people that were gathered together out of the several cities of Judah,
which no doubt was the largest congregation, with whom the priests and
Levites are joined, as being of that kingdom, and dwellers in Jerusalem,
where their office lay:

and all the congregation that came out of Israel; out of the ten tribes,
particularly Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, [Ch2
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#018.md), and the strangers that came out
of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced; the
proselytes, even such as were circumcised, who ate of the passover, and
kept the feast of unleavened bread, as well as the other days of
rejoicing, the former of which none might partake of but circumcised
persons; and it can hardly be thought that any other would come out of
Israel on such an occasion, see [Exo
12:48](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#048.md).

[2 Chronicles 30:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch2 30:26</span></span>

So there was great joy in Jerusalem,.... Not merely carnal, expressed in
eating and drinking, and making merry with one another, but spiritual,
on account of the restoration of temple service, and the feasts of the
Lord:

for since the time of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, there
was not the like in Jerusalem; not the like joy, so spiritual, sincere,
and hearty; nor such a number of persons rejoicing together on such an
occasion; nor for so many days together, which were as many as at the
dedication of the temple by Solomon.

[2 Chronicles 30:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ch2 30:27</span></span>

Then the priests the Levites arose,.... The priests who were of the
tribe of Levi; for there were some in Israel that were not, but were
made of any of the people, as in the times of Jeroboam; though some
supply the copulative "and"; so the Targum: "and blessed the people";
which was the proper work and business of the priests to do; though,
while they were blessing, the Levites might be singing:

and their voice was heard; meaning not by the people, though undoubtedly
it was, but by the Lord; the Targum is,"their prayer was heard or
received;''for the blessing was delivered in a petitionary way, [Num
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#024.md), and was no other than a request
that God would bless them, which he did:

and their prayer came up to his holy dwellingplace, even unto heaven;
see [Psa 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#004.md) by what means it was
known their prayer was heard and accepted cannot be said; there might be
some visible token of it, as the people were dismissed, and departed.
