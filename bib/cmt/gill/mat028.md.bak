### [Matthew Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 28:1</span></span>

In the end of the sabbath,.... This clause is by some joined to the last
verse of the preceding chapter, but stands better here, as appears from
[Mar 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#001.md), and intends not what the
Jews call the sabbath eve, for that began the sabbath; but what they
call , "the goings out of the sabbath"; and as Mark says, [Mar
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#001.md), "when the sabbath was past":
that is, when the sun was set, and any stars appeared. The Vulgate
Latin, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions, and Munster's Hebrew Gospel render
it, "the evening of the sabbath"; and the Persic version, "the night of
the sabbath"; but must mean, not the evening and night, which preceded
the sabbath, and was a part of it, but what followed it, and belonged to
the first day.

As it began to dawn; not the day, but the night; a way of speaking used
by the Jews, who call the night, "light": thus they say (y), , "on the
light, or night of the fourteenth" (of the month Nisan) "they search for
leavened bread", &c. And so the word is used, in [Luk
23:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#054.md), of the eve of the sabbath, or
the beginning of it, as here of the going out of it;

towards the first day of the week, or "sabbaths"; so the Jews used to
call the days of the week, the first day of the sabbath, the second day
of the sabbath, &c. take an instance or two (z).

"The stationary men fast four days in the week, from the second day to
the fifth day; and they do not fast on the sabbath eve (so they
sometimes call the sixth day), because of the glory of the sabbath; nor
, "on the first day of the sabbath", or week, that they may not go from
rest and delight, to labour and fasting, and die.''

On which the Gemara has these words (a);

"the stationary men go into the synagogue, and sit four fastings; , "on
the second of the sabbath", or "week": on the third, and on the fourth,
and on the fifth.''

Came Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, the wife of Cleophas, and
mother of James and Joses, with whom also was Salome, the mother of
Zebedee's children, [Mar 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#001.md). There
seems to be some difference between the evangelists about the time of
the women's coming to the sepulchre. Matthew says, it was "at the end of
the sabbath, when it began to dawn; towards the first day of the week".
John says, that "Mary Magdalene" came "when it was yet dark", [Joh
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#001.md), and yet Mark says, that they
came "at the rising of the sun", [Mar
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#002.md). Though they all agree it was
early in the morning: all they say is no doubt true, and may be
reconciled thus. As soon as the sabbath was ended, the women set out on
their journey, and as they went, bought spices and ointment to anoint
the body with: they passed through the gates of the city before they
were shut, and might stay some time in the suburbs; when Mary Magdalene,
eager to be at the sepulchre, set out first, whilst it was dark, and
came back and reported to Peter what she had seen, and returned again by
such time the other women came, which was at sunrising. From all the
accounts it is clear, that he rose, as is expressly said, [Mar
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#009.md), on the first day of the week,
and which was the third from his death: on the sixth day, which was
Friday, he was crucified, and buried that evening; he lay in the grave
all sabbath day, or Saturday; and rose early on the first day of the
week, before the women got to the sepulchre; who came thither, as it is
here said,

to see the sepulchre: not merely to see it, for they had seen it before,
and where, and how the body of Christ was laid in it; but to see whether
they could enter into it, and anoint the body with the spices and
ointments, which they had prepared and brought with them for that
purpose.

[Matthew 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 28:2</span></span>

And behold there was a great earthquake,.... Or "there had been one";
which, how far it reached, and whether further than the spot of ground
in which the sepulchre was, is not certain: it was an emblem of the
shaking of the earth by the preaching of the Gospel, the sound of which
was now to go after Christ's resurrection to the ends of the world; and
a prelude of the general resurrection, when the earth shall be shaken,
and the graves opened, and the dead come forth; and was a symbol and
token of the presence and majesty of Christ, at whose rising, as at his
death, the earth shook and trembled. Think whether the watch could now
be asleep, as they afterwards gave out, [Mat
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#013.md). The Persic version renders it
very wrongly; "and there was great consternation and fear"; which was
the consequence of the earthquake, and the descent of the angel, and was
so great that it was not possible for the keepers to sleep, if ever so
much inclined:

for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven; perhaps Gabriel, who
brought the news of the conception of Christ to the virgin, and of his
incarnation to the shepherds, and might be the same angel that
strengthened him in the garden: nor is this any contradiction to the
other evangelists, which speak of two angels, [Luk
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#004.md), for Matthew does not say there
were no more than one, though he makes mention but of one.

And came and rolled back the stone from the door; of the sepulchre,
which by Joseph, or his orders, was put there, and was sealed by the
Jews. This might be done, that way might be made for the risen body of
Christ to pass out of the sepulchre; for to suppose, as some do, that he
penetrated through this stone with his risen body, is not to be
credited: it is true, he could have caused the stone to have given way,
or removed it himself, and put it in the place again; as he caused the
doors of the house in which the disciples were, to open and shut so
quick, that they could not discern it when he appeared in the midst of
them, [Joh 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019.md); see [Act
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#010.md), but he might choose to do it by
the ministry of an angel, which is no ways derogatory to his power and
majesty, but rather agreeable. Moreover, this might be done, that the
women might have access to the sepulchre, and enter into it, which was
the thing they were concerned about by the way, who should roll away the
stone for them. Besides, this the angel did, as a token that Christ was
risen, and to let the guard know as much, who, if they thought fit,
might come and see what was done; but chiefly the stone was rolled away
by the angel, as an emblem of the acquittance and discharge of Christ,
as the surety of his people. He had taken upon him their sins; he had
bore them in his body on the tree; he had suffered and died for them,
and was laid as a prisoner in the grave; and now full satisfaction being
made, an angel is sent from heaven to roll away the stone; thereby
signifying, that the debt was fully paid, and he was now legally
discharged. It is added,

and sat upon it; thereby showing who it was that rolled it away; that it
was done by him, not by the earthquake, nor by any human power: he sat
there defying the guard of soldiers to come nigh; and waiting for the
coming of the women, to tell them the good news, that their Lord was
risen; and as the keeper of the sepulchre, that no corpse might be
brought and laid in the room of Christ, and it be said that he was not
risen. This posture of the angel does not contradict what other
evangelists say of this, and the other angel, that they stood by the
women, and also were sitting in the sepulchre, [Mar
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#005.md), for each was true: when the
women first came, the angel sat upon the stone; after that, with the
other, stood by them; when having invited them to the grave, placed
themselves, sitting the one at the head, and the other at the feet,
where the body of Christ had lain.

[Matthew 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 28:3</span></span>

His countenance was like lightning,.... There was such a lustre and
brightness in his face, that it glittered like lightning: such a
description is in [Dan 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#006.md),

and his raiment white as snow: the word "white" is left out in the
Vulgate Latin, and in Munster's Hebrew Gospel: the angel appeared clad
in white, as a token of the purity and innocence of his nature; and
because of the victory and triumph of Christ over death and the grave;
and that he might be known and taken by the women for a good angel, it
being a commonly received notion of the Jews, that ministering angels
were clothed in white (b).

"Said R. Ame to R. Levi, show me the Persians; he said to him, they are
like to the mighty men of the house of David: show me the Chaberin,
(another nation near the Persians,) they are like to destroying angels:
show me the Ishmaelites, they are like to devils of the house of Hacsa:
show me the disciples of the wise men in Babylon, they are like to the
ministering angels.''

Upon which the gloss says,

""to the devils", because they are clothed in black, and are like to
devils; to "the ministering angels", "they are clothed in white", and
veiled like the ministering angels; as it is written in [Eze
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#002.md), "and the man was clothed with
linen": and it is said (c) of R. Judah, that he was veiled, and sat in
fine linen fringed, and was like to an angel of the Lord of hosts: and
elsewhere (d) it is said, who are the ministering angels? the Rabbins:
and why are they called ministering angels? because they are fringed, as
the ministering angels, in beautiful garments.''

\(b\) T. Bab. Kiddushin, fol. 72. 1. (c) T. Bab. Sabbat, fol. 25. 2. (d)
T. Bab. Nedarim, fol. 20. 2.

[Matthew 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 28:4</span></span>

And for fear of him the keepers did shake,.... Though they were
soldiers, Roman soldiers and veterans, who had been used to terrible
sights in the field of battle; were men of courage, and fearless of
danger; and yet were seized with a panic, and every limb of them shook
and trembled at the sight of the angel, for fear he was come as an
executioner of divine vengeance upon them; who had been concerned in the
crucifixion of Christ, had watched him as he hung upon the cross, and
now his body in the sepulchre: and even supposing no consciousness of
guilt in them, or dread of punishment from him; yet such was the glory
and majesty in which he appeared, of which they had never seen the like
before, that it had this effect upon them:

and became as dead men: they turned pale, as dead men, and had scarce
any life, or spirit, left in them.

[Matthew 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 28:5</span></span>

And the angel answered and said unto the women,.... Who being come up,
were also affrighted at the sight of the angel. The Arabic version
leaves out the first part, "and the angel answered": which is a Jewish
way of speaking, when nothing goes before, to which it is a reply; and
renders the other part thus, "and said to the two women": but from the
other evangelists it appears, that there were more women than two; see
[Mar 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#001.md),

fear not ye; some put an emphasis upon the word "ye", as if used in
opposition to the keepers, who had reason to be afraid, but not these
good women. It was very common with gracious persons to be filled with
fear at the sight of an angel, as Zacharias, and the shepherds; but
without reason; they are their friends, their fellow servants, and
ministering spirits to them. The Persic version adds, "but come near
before, for ye are his familiars": the reason alleged, by the angel, why
they had no reason to fear, is,

for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified: the knowledge which
angels have of saints is very considerable, and which arises from their
frequent embassies to them, care and guardianship of them, the good
offices they perform, and their several ministrations to them; and the
knowledge which the angel had of these good women, might not be from
immediate revelation, but from the observations he had made of them:
they had followed Jesus from Galilee, they had attended him all the
while he was on the cross, and were now come to his grave to anoint him;
and from their words and gestures, the angel might know that they were
the disciples of Christ, and now sought him; and therefore had no reason
to fear, as those who were his adversaries: and indeed, such as seek a
crucified Christ, and life and salvation by him, have no reason to be
afraid of any thing; not of sin, and its damning power, since Christ
saves, his blood cleanses, and his righteousness justifies from all sin;
nor of the law, its menaces, curses, and condemnation, for Christ has
redeemed them from it; nor of Satan, and his principalities and powers,
who are spoiled by Christ, and out of whose hands he has ransomed his
people; nor of the world, since Christ has overcome it, and delivered
his people from it; nor of death, whose sting is taken away, and that
abolished as a penal evil; nor of hell, and wrath to come, from which he
has saved them; and much less of good angels, who are kindly disposed to
them: and such are they that seek a crucified Christ, whom Christ has
first sought, and looked up, and found in redemption and the effectual
calling; who are made sensible of their lost and dangerous state by
nature, to whom Christ has been manifested; and who see both their need
of him, and his worth and value: these seek to him in the first place,
and with all their hearts, for cleansing, pardon, righteousness, rest,
food, salvation, and eternal life: they seek for him where he is, and is
revealed, in the Scriptures, in the Gospel, in the ordinances, and at
the Father's right hand.

[Matthew 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 28:6</span></span>

He is not here,.... In the grave, where he was laid, and these women saw
him laid: he was dead, but is now alive; he was laid in the grave, but
God would not leave him there, nor suffer him to see corruption:

for he is risen, as he said; not stolen away, as the chief priests hired
the soldiers to say he was; nor removed to another place, as Mary
Magdalene first thought, when she found him gone; but he was risen from
the dead, by the power of his Father, and by his own power, as he had
before said he should. In one of Beza's exemplars it is added, "to you";
for the words that Christ said in Galilee, that he should be delivered
into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and rise again, the
third day, were said in the presence and hearing of these women, and to
them, as well as to the disciples; see . This clause is left out in the
Persic version: it follows,

come see the place where the Lord lay; the Lord both of angels and men:
the Syriac and Persic versions read, "our Lord". The Arabic and Ethiopic
versions leave out the word "Lord", and only read "he". Christ, as the
Son of God, lay in the bosom of his Father, and in the arms of his love,
from all eternity; as mediator, he lay in the womb of God's purposes and
decrees, being his elect, in whom his soul delighted; as man, he lay in
the womb of the virgin; and, as an example to his people, he lay, when
baptized, in the waters of Jordan; and as the language of the ordinance
of the Lord's supper is, "come see my hands, and my feet"; that of
baptism is, "come see the place where the Lord lay": but here it regards
the grave, in which the body of Christ had been laid; and the women are
invited by the angel to go along with him, into the sepulchre, to see
the place where he had lain; to assure them the more of the truth of his
resurrection, that they might, with their own eyes, see that he was
gone, who before had beheld where, and how he was laid; as also to
affect them with the condescending grace of Christ, in making his grave
with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; as well as to
strengthen their faith in their discharge from sin and condemnation by
Christ, who was risen for their justification; as also to let them see
that the grave was perfumed and sanctified by him; and he was risen as
the first fruits and pledge of them that slept.

[Matthew 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 28:7</span></span>

And go quickly and tell his disciples,.... Who were mourning and weeping
for the death of Christ; despairing of his resurrection, of which, at
least, they had but little hope, nor indeed much thought, though Christ
had so often told them of it; and therefore a quick dispatch was
necessary to remove their sorrow, revive their faith, and relieve their
souls, to which the errand these women were sent upon, and the news they
were to bring, had a tendency; namely,

that he is risen from the dead: than which nothing could be more joyful
news unto them, as it is to all believers; for on this depend the
justification and salvation of God's elect; their security from
condemnation, and their resurrection from the dead. This news was first
brought to the apostles by women, who were greatly honoured hereby; that
as the woman was first in the transgression, and the cause of death, so
the first news of the resurrection of Christ to life, and of life and
immortality being by him, who was first showed the path of life, were
brought by women; and to a woman it was that Christ first appeared after
his resurrection, [Mar 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#009.md). The
Vulgate Latin only reads, "that he is risen", as in the former verse.

And behold he goeth before you into Galilee. These are still the words
of the angel to the women, telling them what they should say to the
apostles, that he should go before them into Galilee; and which might
serve to confirm the resurrection to them, and to give the greater
credit to the report of the women, since this very thing Christ had
promised them before; see [Mat 26:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#032.md),
though it was also true, that he should go before these women into
Galilee, and who also should see him there: for the next words,

there shall ye see him; though they may chiefly design the apostles, who
should have a sight of Christ in Galilee, yet may include these women
also:

lo! I have told you; I "Gabriel", who am an angel of the Lord, sent by
him to inform you of these things; and you may depend upon the truth of
them, that Jesus is risen, and that he is about, in a very little time,
to go before his disciples into Galilee, where they shall see him with
their bodily eyes, and have a free and familiar conversation with him.
The reasons why this place was pitched upon for Christ and his apostles
to meet in, were, because here he first preached, and chiefly conversed,
and had the largest number of disciples there, to whom he meant to show
himself, as he did, [Co1 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#006.md), as well
as to his apostles: moreover, the apostles were of Galilee, and so were
these women; and to go into their own country, and there meet with
Jesus, must be very agreeable; and besides, there they would be safer
and freer from the molestations and persecutions of the Jews; and might
follow their former calling, as they did, until the time they were to be
further employed in preaching the Gospel.

[Matthew 28:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 28:8</span></span>

And they departed quickly from the sepulchre,.... Or "they went out from
it", as it may be rendered, and as it is in [Mar
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#008.md), which shows, that they went into
the sepulchre upon the invitation of the angel, and saw the place where
the Lord lay; and here it was the angel gave them their instructions,
and errand to the disciples; which as soon as they received, they
quitted the sepulchre in all haste, partly in obedience to the angel's
orders, and partly through surprise and fear; for Mark says, "they fled
from the sepulchre", [Mar 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#008.md), as
persons terrified and affrighted: and it is added here,

with fear and great joy: a mixture of both these; with fear and dread,
because of the vision they had seen, and with joy at the news of
Christ's resurrection; and yet in this their faith might not be so
confirmed, as to have no doubt about it: they might fear the body was
taken away, and removed to some other place, and that this they had seen
might be a deception and a delusion. However, between both joy and fear,
they set out,

and did run to bring his disciples word; as Mary Magdalene ran to Peter,
[Joh 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#002.md), nor is running unusual for
women, or unbecoming them on certain occasions; see [Gen
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#020.md). Their fright, as well as their
joy, and their regard to the angel's order, might cause them to run, and
make the quicker dispatch.

[Matthew 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 28:9</span></span>

And as they went to tell his disciples,.... This clause is wanting in
the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic, and Persic versions, and in Beza's
most ancient copy; but it stands in the Ethiopic version, and in
Munster's Hebrew Gospel,

behold, Jesus met them: that they might be confirmed in what the angel
had told them, and their fear might be removed, and their joy increased;
and also be capable of reporting to the disciples not only what they had
heard from the angel, but what they had seen themselves; they being now
eyewitnesses, as well as earwitnesses of his resurrection: so souls in
the way of their duty, as these women were, oftentimes meet with Jesus,
and he with them, as they may expect, and indeed not otherwise:

saying, all hail; all health of soul and body, all happiness and
prosperity, both temporal, spiritual, and eternal, attend you. The
Syriac and Persic versions, and Munster's Hebrew Gospel render it,
"peace be to you"; which, it is highly probable, was the phrase used by
Christ, since it was the common form of salutation among the Jews, and
what Christ made use of at other times; see [Joh
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019.md),

and they came; near unto him, being encouraged by the above salutation,
and knowing who he was by his voice, habit, and gesture:

and held him by the feet; they threw themselves prostrate at his feet,
in token of reverence and humility; and they laid hold on his feet, that
they might know, and be assured that he was really risen, and that it
was not a spirit, or a mere phantom and appearance; and they held him in
affection to him, and as desirous of his continuance with them:

and worshipped him: with divine adoration, expressing their love to him;
their faith and hope in him, owning him to be their Lord and God; he
being, by his resurrection from the dead, declared to be the Son of God,
with power; and so the proper object of religious worship.

[Matthew 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 28:10</span></span>

Then said Jesus unto them, be not afraid,.... Of me, or what you have
seen; or lest there should be any deception in the case. In other
respects the saints are subject to fears; as lest they should have no
share in the love of God, nor interest in Christ, or the work of God is
not begun in their hearts; and by reason of sin, lest that should get
the ascendant over them, and they perish by it, and so fall short of
eternal glory; when it is the will of Christ to have these fears
removed, by shedding abroad his love in their hearts, by affording his
gracious presence, views of interest in him, and promises of his grace,
by sending his Spirit, word, and ministers to comfort them, by
discovering and applying pardoning grace to them, and showing his power
to keep them.

Go tell my brethren; meaning not his kinsmen according to the flesh, but
his disciples, who were in this relation to him, as all the elect of God
are; not only through his incarnation, he being their "Goel", their near
kinsman, and Redeemer, and of the same nature, flesh, and blood with
them, and like unto them in all things, excepting sin; but on account of
their divine adoption, to which they were predestinated, and which they
received through his redemption, and under the witnessings of the
Spirit: he that is his God being theirs; and he that is his Father being
theirs also: and which was made manifest in their regeneration, by their
faith in him; and obedience to him, and his Father; see [Mat
12:49](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#049.md). A very considerable relation
this is, that the disciples stood in to Christ, who is the eternal Son
of God, and heir of all things; and wonderful grace and condescension it
was in Christ to own the relation, when they had so lately forsaken him;
and now he was raised from the dead, and had glory given him:

that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me: he does not say
they should not see him before: for they saw him, all but Thomas, that
very evening, and all of them eight days after; and both times were
before they went into Galilee: but this he said, to put them in mind of
what he had promised them, [Mat 26:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#032.md),
and to confirm the words of the angel; and which might serve for a
confirmation of the truth of these things, both to the women, and to the
disciples, when they observed the exact agreement between the words of
Christ, and of the angel. Moreover, it may be remarked, that wherever
Christ has appointed to meet his people, they may expect, and be sure to
see him at one time or another; as in his house and ordinances, where
they are sometimes indulged with a sight of him by faith, which is an
appropriating, assimilating, soul rejoicing, and satisfying one; when
with pleasure they behold the glory of his divine person, and of his
offices, the transcendent excellencies and perfections of his nature,
his love and his loveliness, the beauty and amiableness of him, the
fulness of grace, life, and righteousness in him, and so the
suitableness of him as their Saviour and Redeemer; and when they are
favoured with communion with him, and the joys of his salvation.

[Matthew 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 28:11</span></span>

Now when they were going,.... Or were gone from the sepulchre: that is,
the women, Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, and their companions,
when they were going, or gone, and before they could come to the
disciples, to inform them of what they had seen and heard, and deliver
the message both of the angel, and of Christ, unto them:

behold, some of the watch came unto the city: that is, "of Jerusalem".
The word "behold" is left out in the Syriac, Persic, and Ethiopic
versions; but ought to be retained as expressive of what is wonderful,
and worthy of observation and attention; that the very persons who were
placed to prevent every thing, that might be the foundation of a report,
that Christ was risen, should be the first persons that should relate it
to the chief priests and elders, that employed them: not all the watch,
for some still stayed behind, till they had orders to come away; but
some of them, the principal of them, or who were deputed by the rest,
came. The Persic version, rather commenting than translating, has these
words:

"moreover, the rulers and governors, who watched the sepulchre, coming
to themselves, returned to the city with a pale and frightened
countenance.''

And showed unto the chief priests all the things that were done; how
that there had been a very great earthquake, and a very surprising
appearance; one like a young man descended from the clouds, whose
countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow, which
filled them with astonishment and dread; that he rolled away the stone
from the sepulchre, and then sat upon it; and that some women coming to
the sepulchre, were shown by him where the body had been laid, but was
now gone; and how, that after they had recovered themselves from the
fright, they had themselves examined the sepulchre, and the body was
certainly gone; and sure they were that the women did not carry it away,
nor any other: all which they thought proper to relate to the chief
priests; partly on their own account, to clear themselves from the
charge of bribery and corruption, and sloth and negligence; and partly
that the chief priests might consider what was proper to be done at such
a juncture.

[Matthew 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 28:12</span></span>

And when they were assembled with the elders,.... Upon this the grand
sanhedrim was convened together, which consisted of the chief priests,
Scribes, and elders;

and had taken counsel among themselves what steps to take to stifle this
matter, that it might not spread and be believed by the people; they
agreed upon this, as the best expedient, to bribe the soldiers to give a
false account of it, as they did:

they gave large money unto the soldiers, or "sufficient money"; they
gave large sums of money, as were enough to satisfy the soldiers; they
gave them whatever they would have; for though these men were very
covetous, yet upon this occasion gave liberally; and that perhaps which
were for the sacrifices, or for the repair of the temple, or for the
supply of the poor.

[Matthew 28:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 28:13</span></span>

Saying, say ye his disciples came by night,.... They charged them to
tell every one that should ask them about this affair; and even publish
it every where, that the disciples of Christ came in the dead of the
night,

and stole him away while we slept: which was a very unlikely thing, and
a foolish scheme this, for such a body of men to form. There is no show
of probability in it, that the disciples, who were intimidated by the
taking and putting Christ to death, and were now shut up in a house, for
fear of the Jews, that these should venture out in the night, to take
away the body of Christ, which was decently and honourably interred in a
garden of one of his disciples: and when they knew it was guarded by a
company of Roman soldiers; and who besides had no notion of his
resurrection from the dead, nor never thought of it till he was risen,
and therefore would never attempt any thing of this kind, in order to
give out such a report. Moreover, had they took it away by stealth, it
is not reasonable to think that they would afterwards have reported such
a lie every where, that he was risen from the dead, when they were sure
to obtain nothing by it, but reproach, afflictions, persecutions, and
death: add to this, that this was never objected to them by their worst
enemies, when they most strongly asserted his resurrection: nor was it a
feasible account, or well put together, with respect to the watch. It
can hardly be thought that they should be all of them asleep at once;
and if they were, it is much they were not awaked by the coming up of
the disciples, and the rolling away of the stone, and the bustle there
must be in taking up the body, and carrying it away; and besides, if
they were asleep, and continued so, what is their evidence good for? for
how could they know that his disciples came and took him away? if they
awaked, though too late, and saw them at a distance, why did not they
pursue them, who might easily have been overtaken with such a burden? at
least, why did not they search their houses for the body? and take up
both the women and the disciples, and prosecute them for it? and yet
nothing of this was done. Besides, how came the linen clothes to be left
behind? why did they take the napkin from his head, and give themselves
all that trouble to unwrap the body, and carry it away naked? It is
clear the chief priests themselves were convinced in their own minds,
that he was truly risen, or they would have punished the soldiers
severely for their sleep and negligence, and would never have given them
money to spread such a story.

[Matthew 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 28:14</span></span>

And if this come to the governor's ears,.... Not the governor of the
watch, but Pontius Pilate the governor of Judea: if this should be told
him, and should be heard by him; or this matter should come before him,
and be under his examination, and there should be any danger of
punishment; for to sleep on the watch was severely punished by the
Romans:

we will, persuade him; that this is the true state of the case, and
intercede with him, and make use of all our interest, not to punish for
it: or will persuade him, that though this is a false account, yet it
will be much better that it should go in this way, for his own peace,
and the peace of the nation, and the security of the Roman government;
since, should it spread among the people, that this person was really
raised from the dead, they would, one and all, believe he was the true
Messiah, and would set him up as a king, and seize upon the government
in favour of him:

and will secure you; indemnify you, bear you harmless, keep you from
punishment; so that you need not be under any care, or concern on this
account.

[Matthew 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 28:15</span></span>

So they took the money, and did as they were taught,.... Though they had
been just now in the greatest fright and consternation imaginable, at
the sight of the angel, and knew what was done; yet being men of no
religion or conscience, were tempted with the money, and took it, and
reported every where what had been put into their mouths by the chief
priests and elders.

And this saying is commonly reported among the Jews unto this day; to
the time that Matthew wrote this Gospel; which according to the
subscriptions to a most ancient copy of Beza's, and the Syriac and
Arabic versions of De Dieu, was in the "eighth" year after our Lord's
ascension; though others make it to be the "ninth"; and others the
"fifteenth". The sense is, not that this narrative the evangelist gives,
that the sanhedrim bribed the soldiers to give out such a lying story,
was known to the Jews, and commonly reported by them; though some take
this to be the sense; but that it was reported and believed among the
Jews in common, to that time, that the disciples of Christ did really
come in the night, and steal away the body of Christ, while the watch
slept: to such judicial blindness, and hardness of heart, were they
given up, as to believe a lie, and which had no appearance of truth in
it. They have since contrived a more monstrous and ridiculous story than
this. They say (e), that Judas, seeing where the body was laid, and the
disciples sitting upon the tomb, and mourning over it, in the middle of
the night, took his opportunity to take away the body, and buried it in
his own garden, under a current of water; having first turned the water
another way, and then put it in the same course as before; and which he
afterwards discovered to the Jews; and the body was taken up and
exposed, and insulted in the most ignominious manner: but alas! Judas
had hanged himself some days before; and had he been living, would not
have been capable of doing what they ascribe unto him.

[Matthew 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 28:16</span></span>

Then the eleven disciples,.... For Judas was not only gone from them,
but was dead; so that there were now but eleven of them: went

away into Galilee: not directly, as soon as the women had delivered
their message; for Christ appeared to them the same day at Jerusalem;
and so he did at the same place that week; see [Joh
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019.md), but some time, after this they
went together into Galilee, according to Christ's direction both before
and after his resurrection, [Mat
26:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#032.md),

into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them; either before his death,
or since he was risen; and very likely at one of the above interviews he
had with them. This is generally thought to be Mount Tabor; but of this
there is no proof, nor certainty: it might be the mountain near
Capernaum, on which he taught, [Mat
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#001.md), or that, if not the same with the
other, near the sea of Galilee, where Christ fed four thousand with
seven loaves, and a few fishes, [Mat
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#029.md). A mountain was appointed for
this meeting, both for solitariness and for sight; for here it was he
was seen by above five hundred brethren at once, [Co1
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#006.md).

[Matthew 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 28:17</span></span>

And when, they saw him, they worshipped him,.... With divine adoration,
as the eternal Son of God; for so he was now declared to be by his
resurrection from the dead, [Rom 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004.md),

but some doubted; or "some of them", as the Syriac and Arabic versions
render it; that is, some of the eleven disciples: not that they doubted
now that Christ was risen from the dead; since he had appeared several
times to them before this, and had given them all the proofs of the
truth of his resurrection they could desire; but they, who worshipped
him now in Galilee, had doubted before in Jerusalem; not only Thomas,
but all of them: they looked upon the words of the women as idle tales;
nor did the rest believe the two disciples, with whom Christ travelled
to Emmaus: wherefore he upbraids them for their unbelief, [Luk
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#011.md), or else the sense is, that some
of them, though they believed Christ was risen from the dead, of which
they had had the strongest assurance; yet they doubted whether what they
then saw on the mountain was he, or whether it was not a spirit, or a
mere phantom; and therefore, as in the next verse, he "came" nearer to
them, when they knew him: or else this may be understood of some of the
seventy disciples, or of the five hundred brethren, who saw him at this
time, and at first had some doubts of his resurrection, but were
afterwards fully satisfied.

[Matthew 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 28:18</span></span>

And Jesus came and spake unto them,.... To the eleven disciples and
apostles; for though there might be so large a number as before
observed, yet the following words were only spoken to the apostles:

saying, all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth; which is to
be understood of him, not as God, who has the same original and
underived power and authority over all creatures, and things in heaven
and earth, as the Father has; but as mediator, to whom all things are
delivered by the Father; and not of a power of doing this, or the other
thing, or of omnipotence, being the Almighty; nor of doing miracles, and
forgiving sins, which he had, and exercised before his death and
resurrection, but of governing: he was king before, but his kingdom was
not with observation; but now he was declared, and made manifest, to be
both Lord and Christ; he had "all" power and authority for the settling
the affairs of his church and kingdom, to appoint offices and officers
in it, and, to bestow gifts upon men, to qualify them for the same, and
to institute ordinances to be observed till his second coming: and this
power of his reached to things in heaven; he having the angels in heaven
subject to him, as ministering spirits to be sent forth by him at his
pleasure; and all the gifts of the Spirit to dispose of as he thought
good; and to things on earth, not only to the saints, whose King he is,
and who are made willing to serve him; but to all flesh, to kings and
princes, who rule and reign by him; and even to all the wicked of the
world, who in some shape or another are made to subserve the ends of his
mediatorial kingdom and government: and this is not usurped power, but
what is given him, and what he has a right to exercise; having finished
sin, abolished death, overcome the world, and destroyed the devil; and
must reign till all enemies are subject to him: and this he says, and it
was necessary to say it at this time, partly on account of his late
sufferings and death, which were attended with weakness and reproach;
and partly on account of the following commission he gives to his
disciples, that it might be seen and believed, he had power and
authority sufficient to give them such an one; as also to animate and
encourage them under all the weakness, contempt, and persecution that
should attend them in their ministry. The Syriac and Persic versions
add, "as the Father hath sent me, even so I send you", as in [Joh
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#021.md), from whence these words seem to
be taken.

[Matthew 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 28:19</span></span>

Go ye therefore,.... Into all the world; some into one place, and some
into another; since his power and authority, and so now the commission
he gave them, reached every where: before it was confined to Judea, but
now it is extended to all the nations of the world; see [Mat
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#006.md),

and teach all nations; Jews and Gentiles, first the one, and then the
other, the doctrines of the Gospel, and the ordinances of it; whatever
they had learned from Christ, or were ordered by him, or "disciple all
nations": make them disciples by teaching them; or, as the Persic
version, by way of explanation, adds, "bring them to my religion and
faith": not that they were able to do this of themselves, but they were
to teach men externally, or outwardly minister the word, whilst the
Spirit of God internally applied it, and taught, and made men true
disciples of Christ: and they are such, who have learned to know
themselves, their sin, and lost estate by nature; to deny themselves,
both sinful and righteous self; who have learnt to know Christ, and the
way of righteousness, peace, pardon, life, and salvation by him; and who
are taught and enabled to part with all for Christ, and to bear all for
his sake, and to believe in him, and give up themselves to him, and
follow him whithersoever he goes:

baptizing them; not all nations, for the antecedent to the relative
"them", cannot be "all nations"; since , the words for "all nations",
are of the neuter gender, whereas "them", is of the masculine: nor can
it be thought that it should be the mind of Christ, that all the
individuals of all nations should be baptized, as Heathens, Turks, and
Jews; but "disciples", supposed and contained in the word "teach", or
"make disciples"; such as are taught, and made disciples by teaching, or
under the ministry of the word by the Spirit of God: Christ's orders are
to "baptize": "dip" them, as Munster's Hebrew Gospel renders it; that
is, in water, which, though not expressed, is implied; for with no other
baptism could the apostles baptize: not with the Holy Ghost, and with
fire; for this was Christ's peculiar prerogative; but with water, which
they in obedience to this commission practised, [Act
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#036.md), and which was to be done

in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; by the
authority of these three divine persons, who all appeared, and testified
their approbation of the administration of this ordinance, at the
baptism of Christ: and as they are to be invocated in it, so the persons
baptized not only profess faith in each divine person, but are devoted
to their service, and worship, and are laid under obligation to
obedience to them, Hence a confirmation of the doctrine of the Trinity,
there are three persons, but one name, but one God, into which believers
are baptized; and a proof of the true deity both of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost; and that Christ, as the Son of God, is God; since baptism is
administered equally in the name of all three, as a religious ordinance,
a part of divine instituted worship, which would never be in the name of
a creature. This is the first, and indeed the only, place in which the
Trinity of persons is expressed in this order, and in the selfsame
words. Galatinus (f) pretends, that the ancient Jews used the same way
of speaking. It would be well if proof could be made of it: he asserts
it to be in Zohar on [Deu 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#004.md), and in
the Targum of Jonathan ben Uzziel on [Isa
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#003.md). In the former he says, it is
expressed thus, "hear, O Israel; the Lord", he is called "the Father;
our God", he is called the Son; "is one Lord", this is "the Holy Ghost",
who proceeds from both; and again, by the same R. Simeon, it is said,
"holy", this is "the Father"; "holy", this is "the Son"; "holy", this is
, "the Holy Ghost": and in the latter after this manner, "Holy Father,
Holy Son, and Holy Holy Ghost"; but no such words are now to be found in
either of these places. He affirms, that he himself saw a copy of
Jonathan's Targum that had these words. The Jews often speak of the
Tetragrammaton, or name of four letters, the name Jehovah, which they
say is not lawful to be pronounced; and also of the name of twelve
letters, which the above writer (g) makes to be "Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost"; and of forty two letters, which from a book called Gale Razia,
he says is,

"Father God, Son God, Holy Ghost God, three in one, and one in three;''

which in the Hebrew language make up so many letters; but this wants
better authority.

Teaching them to observe all things,.... All ordinances, not only
baptism, but the Lord's supper; all positive institutions, and moral
duties; all obligations, both to God and men; all relative duties that
respect the world, or one another, those that are without, and those
that are within; and these are to be taught them, and therefore to be
insisted on in the ministry of the word; and not merely in order that
they may know them, and have the theory of them, but that the may put
them into practice:

whatsoever I have commanded you; every thing that Christ has commanded,
be it what it will, and nothing else; for Christ's ministers are not to
teach for doctrines the commandments of men; or enjoin that on the
churches, which is of their own, or other men's devising, and was never
ordered by Christ; and for their encouragement he adds,

and lo! I am with you always, even unto the end of the world: meaning,
not merely to the end of their lives, which would be the end of the
world to them; nor to the end of the Jewish world, or state, which was
not a great way off, though this is sometimes the sense of this phrase;
but to the end of the world to come, the Gospel church state, which now
took place; or to the end of the present world, the universe: not that
the apostles should live to the end of it; but that whereas Christ would
have a church and people to the end of the world, and the Gospel and the
ordinances of it should be administered so long, and there should be
Gospel ministers till that time; Christ's sense is, that he would grant
his presence to them, his immediate disciples, and to all that should
succeed them in future generations, to the end of time: and which is to
be understood not of his corporeal presence, which they should not have
till then, but of his spiritual presence; and that he would be with
them, in a spiritual sense, to assist them in their work, to comfort
them under all discouragements, to supply them with his grace, and to
protect them from all enemies, and preserve from all evils; which is a
great encouragement both to administer the word and ordinances, and
attend on them.
