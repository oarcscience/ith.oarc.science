### [Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#001.md)

INTRODUCTION TO SONG OF SOLOMON 1

In this chapter, after the general title of the book, [Sol
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#001.md), the church expresses her strong
desires, and most ardent wishes, for some fresh discoveries of the love
of Christ to her, and for communion with him; having tasted of his love,
smelt a sweet savour in his grace, and enjoyed fellowship with him in
his house, [Sol 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#002.md). She observes her
blackness and uncomeliness in herself; the trials and afflictions she
met with from others; and her carelessness and negligence of her own
affairs, [Sol 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#005.md); and entreats her
beloved to direct her where she might meet with him, feeding his flocks,
and giving them rest, to which he returns a kind and gracious answer;
gives her proper instructions where to find him, [Sol
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#007.md); and commends her beauty; sets
forth her amiableness and loveliness, by various metaphors; and makes
promises of more grace and good things to her, [Sol
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#009.md). And then she declares what a
value she had for Christ, her beloved; and how precious he was unto her,
like a bundle of myrrh, and a cluster of camphire, [Sol
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#012.md). Christ again praises her beauty;
and particularly takes notice of her eyes, and her modest look, [Sol
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#015.md); and she returns the encomium
back to him, and expresses her pleasure and satisfaction in the house he
had built for her, and the furniture of it, [Sol
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#016.md).

The Song of songs, which is Solomon's. Wrote by Solomon, king of Israel,
as the "amanuensis" of the Holy Ghost; and not by Hezekiah and his men,
as the Jews say (k): or, "concerning Solomon" (l); Christ, of whom
Solomon was a type; see [Sol 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#007.md); of
his person, excellencies, love to his church, care of her, and concern
for her; and of the nearness and communion he admitted her to, and
indulged her with the Jews have a saying (m), that wherever the word
Solomon is used in this song, the Holy One is meant, the holy God, or
Messiah: it is called "the Song of songs", because the most excellent,
as the Holy of holies, King of kings, &c. which, with the Hebrews,
express a superlative; this being more excellent than the one hundred
and five songs, written by Solomon, or than any human composure
whatever; yea, preferable to all Scriptural songs, as to subject, manner
of style, and copiousness of it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sol 1:2</span></span>

Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth,.... That is, Solomon;
Christ, the antitype of Solomon, the church's beloved; or it is a
relative without an antecedent, which was only in her own mind, "let
him"; him, whom her thoughts were so much employed about; her affections
were so strongly after; and whose image was as it were before her,
present to her mind: and "the kisses of his mouth", she desires, intend
some fresh manifestations and discoveries of his love to her; by some
precious word of promise from his mouth, applied to her; and by an open
espousal of her, and the consummation of marriage with her. It may be
rendered, "with one of the kisses of his mouth" (n); kisses with the
ancients were very rare, and used but once when persons were espoused,
and as a token of that; and then they were reckoned as husband and wife
(o): on which account, it may be, it is here desired; since it was after
this we hear of the spouse being brought into the nuptial chamber, and
of the keeping of the nuptial feast, [Sol
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#004.md);

for thy love is better than wine; or "loves" (p); which may denote the
abundance of it; the many blessings of grace which flow from it; and the
various ways in which it is expressed; as well as the high esteem the
church had of it. This is said to be "better than wine"; for the
antiquity of it, it being from everlasting; and for the purity of it,
being free from all dregs of dissimulation and deceit on the part of
Christ, and from all merit, motives, and conditions, on the part of the
church; for its plenty, being shed plenteously in the hearts of
believers, and who may drink abundantly of it; and for its freeness and
cheapness, being to be had without money and without price; and it is
preferable to wine for the effects of it; which not only revives and
cheers heavy hearts, but quickens dead sinners, and comforts distressed
saints; and of which they may drink plentifully, without hurt, yea, to
great advantage.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sol 1:3</span></span>

Because of the savour of thy good ointments,.... It was usual for lovers
to anoint themselves, their hair, garments, &c. to commend themselves to
each other; and it was common to commend each other's ointments, and the
grateful smell of them (q) none being like them, or so agreeable as
theirs: by these ointments may be meant the grace of Christ, the fulness
of it, the oil of gladness with which he is anointed above his fellows,
and without measure; and which so greatly recommends him to his church
and people, [Psa 45:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#007.md);

thy name is as ointment poured forth; which emits the greater odour for
its being poured forth out of the box. The very names of lovers are dear
to one another, sweeter than nectar itself (r); the very mention of them
gives an inexpressible pleasure. This may respect not merely the fame of
Christ spread abroad in the world through the ministry of the word; nor
the Gospel only, which is his name, [Act
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#015.md); and is like a box of ointment
broke open, which diffuses the savour of his knowledge everywhere; but
some precious name of his, as Immanuel, God with us; Jesus, a Saviour;
but more particularly his name Messiah, which signifies anointed, the
anointed Prophet, Priest, and King of his church;

therefore do the virgins love thee: for the preciousness of his person,
the fulness of grace in him, and the truths of his Gospel: and which
love shows itself in a desire of his presence, and communion with him;
in a regard to his word and worship, to his truths and ordinances; and
to his people, to conversation and communion with them. By these virgins
are meant either congregational churches that strictly adhere to Christ,
and to his pure worship; or particular believers, for their inviolate
attachment to him; for the singleness and sincerity of their love to
him; for their uncorruptness in the doctrine of faith; for the truth and
spirituality of their worship; for the purity of their lives and
conversations; for their beauty and comeliness through Christ; for their
colourful and costly attire, being clothed with his righteousness; and
for their modest behaviour, having the ornament of a meek and quiet
spirit.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sol 1:4</span></span>

Draw me,.... With the cords of love, for what draw lovers to each other
more strongly? under the influence of that they cannot bear to be
without each other's company. Aben Ezra takes these words to be spoken
by the virgins, who everyone of them said this, promising upon it to
follow after the drawer; but they are rather the request of the church,
desirous of nearer and more intimate communion with Christ; for this is
not to be understood of drawing at first conversion, as the fruit of
love, and under the influence of grace, [Jer
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#003.md); but of being brought nearer to
Christ, and to enjoy more of him;

we will run after thee; the church and the virgins, she and her
companions, or particular believers; everyone of them in their
respective stations would act with more rigour upon such drawings; would
run in a way of duty, follow Christ, and walk in his steps; and as they
had him for an example, and according to his word, and in the ways of
his commandments: or "that we may run after thee" (s); intimating that
there is no running without drawing; no following Christ, at least no
running after him with alacrity and cheerfulness, without being drawn by
his love, and influenced by his grace;

the King hath brought me into his chambers: the blessing she sought
after, and was so solicitous for in the preceding verses; namely, to
have the marriage consummated, to be owned by Christ as his spouse and
bride, by taking her home, and introducing her into the nuptial chamber;
by putting her into the enjoyment of himself, and the possession of his
substance: and this being done by him as King of saints, yea, of the
world, showed great condescension on his part, and great honour bestowed
on her; since by this act, as he was King, she was declared queen!

we will be glad and rejoice in thee: she and her bridesmaids, the
virgins that attended her; that is, "when he should introduce" her into
his chambers, as some (t) render the words; then they should express
their joy and gladness on that occasion; and that in the greatness,
glory, and fitness of his person; in the fulness of grace in him; in the
blessings of grace from him; in what he has done for, and is to his
church and people; in the offices he bears, and in the relations he
stands in to them; and particularly that of a husband, now declared;

we will remember thy love more than wine: which, upon the introduction
of the bride to the bridegroom, might be plentifully drank; of the
preferableness of Christ's love to wine; see Gill on [Sol
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#002.md); it may design more particularly
the love of Christ, expressed at this time of solemnizing the marriage
between him and his church in an open manner, [Hos
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#019.md); and which would never be
forgotten: Christ's love is remembered when thought of and meditated
upon; when faith is exercised on it, and the desires of the soul are
drawn after it, and the affections set upon it; and when it is often
spoken of to others, being uppermost in the mind; saints under the
Gospel dispensation have an ordinance for this purpose, to, commemorate
the love of Christ;

the upright love thee; or "uprightnesses" (u); men of upright hearts and
conversations, who have right spirits renewed in them; or Israelites
indeed, in whom there is no guile; who have the truth of grace in them,
walk uprightly according to the rule of God's word, and the Gospel of
Christ; and do all they do sincerely, from a principle of love, and with
a view to the glory of God; such love Christ superlatively, sincerely,
fervently, and constantly; and "love him rightly", or "most uprightly",
as some (w) render the phrase.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sol 1:5</span></span>

I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem,.... The church
having obtained of Christ, what she wanted, turns to the daughters of
Jerusalem, the same perhaps with the virgins her companions; they seem
to be young converts, it may be not yet members of the visible church,
but had a great respect for the church, and she for them; and who,
though they had but a small knowledge of Christ her beloved, yet were
desirous of knowing more of him, and seeking him with her; see [Sol
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#009.md); to these she gives this character
of herself, that she was "black" in herself (x), through original sin
and actual transgression; in her own eyes, through indwelling sin, and
many infirmities, spots, and blemishes in life; and in the eyes of the
world, through afflictions, persecutions, and reproaches, she was
attended with, and so with them the offscouring of all things: "but
comely" in the eyes of Christ, called by him his "fair one", the
"fairest among women", and even "all fair", [Sol
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#008.md); through his comeliness put upon
her, the imputation of his righteousness to her; through the beauties of
holiness upon her; through, the sanctifying influences of his Spirit;
and, being in a church state, walking in Gospel order, attending to the
commands and ordinances of Christ; and so beautiful as Tirzah, and
comely as Jerusalem, [Sol 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#004.md); and
upon all accounts "desirable" (y) to Christ, and to his people, as the
word may be rendered;

as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon: each of which are
thought by some to refer to both parts of her character; and suppose
that the tents of Kedar, though they might look poor on the outside,
were full of wealth and riches within; and Solomon's curtains, or
hangings, might have an outward covering not so rich and beautiful as
they were on the inside; but rather the blackness of the church is
designed by the one, and her comeliness by the other. With respect to
her blackness, she compares herself to the tents of Kedar, to the
inhabitants of those tents, who were of a black or swarthy complexion;
Kedar signifies the name of a man whose posterity these were, that dwelt
in tents, even of Kedar the second son of Ishmael, and who inhabited
some part of Arabia; and, their employment being to feed cattle, moved
from place to place for the sake of pasturage, and so dwelt in tents,
which they could easily remove, and hence were called Scenites; and the
tents they dwelt in being made of hair cloth, and continually exposed to
the sun and rain, were very black, and yet a number of them made a fine
appearance, as Dr. Shaw relates (z); though black, yet were beautiful to
behold; he says,

"the Bedouin Arabs at this day live in tents called "hhymes", from the
shelter which they afford the inhabitants; and "beet el shaar", that is,
"houses of hair", from the materials or webs of goats' hair whereof they
were made; and are such hair cloth as our coal sacks are made of; the
colour of them is beautifully alluded to, [Sol
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#005.md); for nothing certainly can afford
(says he) a more delightful prospect than a large extensive plain,
whether in its verdure, or even scorched up by the sunbeams, than, these
movable habitations pitched in circles upon them; of which (he says) he
has seen from three to three hundred.''

And for her comeliness the church compares herself either to the
curtains of Solomon, about his bed, or to the rich hangings of tapestry
in the several apartments of his palace, which no doubt were very costly
and magnificent.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sol 1:6</span></span>

Look not upon me,.... Meaning not with scorn and disdain because of her
meanness; nor as prying into her infirmities to expose her; nor with joy
at her trials and afflictions; neither of these can be supposed in the
daughters of Jerusalem addressed by her: but rather, not look on her as
amazed at her sufferings, as though some strange thing had befallen her;
not at her blackness only, on one account or another, lest they should
be stumbled; but at her beauty also;

because I am black; or "blackish" somewhat black (a), but not so black
as might be thought, or as she was represented: the radicals of the word
being doubled, some understand it as diminishing; but rather it
increases the signification; see [Psa
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#002.md); and so it may be rendered "very
black" (b), exceeding black; and this she repeats for the sake of an
opportunity of giving the reason of it, as follows;

because the sun hath looked upon me; and had burnt her, and made her
black; which effect the sun has on persons in some countries, and
especially on such who are much abroad in the fields, and employed in
rural services (c); as she was, being a keeper of vineyards, as in this
verse, and of flocks of sheep, as in the following. This may be
understood of the sun of persecution that had beat upon her, and had
left such impressions on her, and had made her in this hue, and which
she bore patiently; nor was she ashamed of it; nor should she be
upbraided with it, nor slighted on account of it, see [Mat
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#006.md);

my mother's children were angry with me; by whom may be meant carnal
professors, members of the same society, externally children of the same
mother, pretend to godliness, but are enemies to it: these were "angry"
with the church for holding and defending the pure doctrines of the
Gospel; for keeping the ordinances as they were delivered; and for
faithful reproofs and admonitions to them and others, for their
disagreeable walk: and these grieved the church, and made her go
mourning, and in black; and more blackened her character and reputation
than anything else whatever: though it may be understood of any carnal
men, who descend from mother Eve, or spring from mother earth, angry
with the church and her members preciseness in religion; and
particularly violent persecutors of her, who yet would be thought to be
religious, may be intended;

they made me the keeper of the vineyards; this is another thing that
added to her blackness, lying abroad in the fields to keep the
"vineyards" of others, by which may be meant false churches, as true
ones are sometimes signified by them; and her compliance with their
corrupt worship and ordinances, which was not voluntary, but forced;
they made me, obliged her, and this increased her blackness; as also
what follows;

but mine own vineyard have I not kept; which made her blacker still; her
church state, or the spiritual affairs of her own, her duty and business
incumbent on her (d), were sadly neglected by her: and this sin of hers
she does not pretend to extenuate by the usage of her mother's children;
but ingenuously confesses the fault was her own, to neglect her own
vineyard and keep others, which was greatly prejudicial to her, and was
resented by Christ; upon which it seems he departed from her, since she
was at a loss to know where he was, as appears from the following words.
With the Romans, neglect of fields, trees, and vineyards, came under the
notice of the censors, and was not to go unpunished (e).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sol 1:7</span></span>

Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth,.... With all her heart, cordially
and sincerely; for, notwithstanding her sinful compliance with others,
and neglect of her own affairs, she had not lost her love to Christ;
and, being sensible of her sin and folly, whereby she was deprived of
his company, and communion with him, applies to him to guide, direct,
and restore her wandering soul; and particularly inform her

where, says she,

thou feedest; that is his flock, like a shepherd: for this phrase
supposes him to be a shepherd, as he is, of God's choosing, appointing,
and setting up, the chief, the good, the great, and only Shepherd of the
sheep; and that he has a flock to feed, which is but one, and a little
one, is his property, given him by God, purchased by his blood, called a
flock of slaughter, and yet a beautiful one, he has undertook to feed;
and feeding it includes the whole business of a shepherd, in leading the
sheep into pastures, protecting them from all enemies, restoring them
when wandering, healing their diseases, watching over them in the night
seasons, and making all necessary provisions for them. Or, "tell me how
thou feedest" (f); the manner of it, and with what; which he does by his
ministers, word, and ordinances; with himself, the bread of life; with
the doctrines and promises of the Gospel, and with the discoveries of
his love;

where thou makest thy flocks to rest at noon, either at the noon of
temptation, when Satan's fiery darts fly thick and fast; when Christ is
a shadow and shelter in his person, grace, blood, righteousness, and
sacrifice, [Isa 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#004.md); or the noon of
affliction, when he makes their bed in it, and gives them rest from
adversity; or the noon of persecution, when Christ leads his flocks to
cooling shades, and gives them rest in himself, when troubled by others:
the allusion, is to shepherds, in hot countries, leading their flocks to
some shady place, where they may be sheltered from the scorching heat of
the sun; which, as Virgil says (g), was at the fourth hour, or ten
o'clock, two hours before noon; we read of (h), sheep nooning
themselves, or lying down at noon, under a shade, by a fountain, asleep;

for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy
companions? not real associates with Christ, that keep company with him,
and are attached to his word and ordinances; but false friends,
hypocrites and heretics (i), rivals with him, who set up schemes of
worship and doctrine in opposition to his; such as Papists, Socinians,
&c. now such false teachers have had their flocks in all ages, such as
have followed them, and have formed separate societies; and therefore
the church, sensible of their craftiness, and her own weakness, and
liableness to go astray, desires she might not be under, and left to
such a temptation, as to apostatize from Christ, and join to such
persons and their flocks, or seem to do so: or, "be as one that covereth
herself", or "is covered" (k); as a harlot; so Tamar, [Gen
38:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#014.md); or as a widow in mourning; she
chose not to be, or to be thought to be, either as one that left her
husband, an unchaste woman; or had lost her husband, or as if she had
none, when neither was the case: or, "as one that spreads the tent" (l);
by the flocks of such; as if in communion with them, and joining with
them in feeding their flocks; and therefore desires she might speedily
know where Christ was, and go to him, that such an aspersion or
suspicion might at once be wiped from her.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sol 1:8</span></span>

If thou know not,.... Or, "seeing thou knowest not" (m); the saints in
this imperfect state know but in part, are ignorant of many things, and
in some measure of themselves; for though they know much of the
sinfulness and deceitfulness of their hearts, yet they know not all; and
of their imperfection and weakness, yet not the whole of it; and some
render the words, "if thou know not to thee", or, "for thyself", as
Ainsworth; or "know not thyself" (n), as others; hence Ambrose (o)
observes, that "nosce teipsum" was not originally from the Pythian
oracle; Solomon had it before that, and he from Moses, [Deu
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#009.md); Saints have not a perfect
knowledge of Christ and his truths, and are sometimes at a loss to know
where he is, his word is purely preached, and his ordinances faithfully
administered;

O thou fairest among women; these are not the words of the daughters of
Jerusalem, as some think, who were not capable of giving her the
following advice and directions; but of Christ himself, to whom the
church applied for it; who, though black in her own eyes, and in the
eyes of others, yet was fair, surpassingly fair, fairer than all others
in his eye, even notwithstanding her late sinfulness and negligence;
which shows the invariableness of his love; who directs her as follows;

go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock; not "from the footsteps"
(p); as if it was an exhortation to depart from false teachers, their
doctrine and worship, and the abettors of them, she was tempted to turn
aside to; but the "footsteps" are the rule and mark by which she was to
go, and on which she was to keep her eye, and steer her course by, in
seeking after Christ: for by "the flock" is meant the flock of Christ;
and by the "footsteps" of it the ways and ordinances in which saints
walk in obedience to Christ; and who are to be followed so far as they
follow him; their steps are to be trod in; and this is the readiest and
most likely way to find Christ, even where saints meet together, the
word is preached, and ordinances administered;

and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents; the faithful ministers of
the word, who are Christ's undershepherds, have their mission and
commission from him, and are qualified by him to feed his flocks, and do
feed them by the pure administration of the word and ordinances; and by
the tents are meant the places of public worship, where they usually
preach the Gospel, and administer ordinances. The allusion is to the
tents of shepherds pitched for the convenience of feeding their flocks;
and "by" or "near" (q) these the church is directed to "feed her kids",
young converts weak in the faith; men of "little faith", as Aben Ezra
interprets it; called "kids" or young goats, lascivious (r), and of an
ill smell; because of sin in them, of an ill smell to themselves and
others; and of whom the world have an ill opinion; and such on all
accounts need encouragement from the church and ministers. It was common
in the eastern countries, as Philo says (s) of the Arabs, not for men
only to keep flocks, but women also, and young virgins; and not the
common people only, but nobles; of women keeping flocks see [Gen

I have compared thee, O my love,.... The church having taken the
direction of Christ, had now found him, and was with him; and when for
her encouragement and comfort he greets her as his love, an appellation
very usual among lovers; and in the chastest sense between husband and
wife; the church was Christ's love, being both the object and subject of
it; to whom he had showed love, and whose love was shed abroad in her
heart; or "my friend" (t), another name used among lovers; there is a
mutual friendship between Christ and his people; they are Christ's
friends, and he is theirs, [Sol 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#001.md).
The Septuagint render it "my neighbour", whom Christ loves as himself;
and they dwell near each other; he dwells in them, and they in him, [Joh
6:56](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#056.md); and here are compared by him

to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots; or "I have likened thee",
or reckoned thee like (u); formed such an image of thee in my mind, with
regard to some peculiar excellencies in her which agreed therewith: or
to "my mare" (w), as some translate the word, which ran in one of his
chariots, called Pharaoh's chariot; because perhaps it was made a
present of to him by Pharaoh king of Egypt, his father in law, for which
he had a particular regard, as Alexander for his Bucephalus; nor is such
a comparison of a woman a disagreeable one, since, as Marckius observes,
many women have had their names from the horse, because of some
celebrated excellency in them (x); and Theocritus (y) compares Queen
Helena to a Thessalian horse in a chariot; and it is thought he took the
hint from this song, as admiring it; so, by others (z), persons are
compared to mares for their beautiful form. Christ's church and people
be compared to "the horse" for their strength, majesty, and comeliness;
they are strong in Christ, and in his grace, and of an undaunted courage
in bearing hardships, reproaches, and persecutions for his sake, and in
fighting the Lord's battles; and are stately and majestic, especially a
company of them in Gospel order, [Sol
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#004.md); and are very comely and beautiful
in their trappings, clothed with the righteousness of Christ, and the
graces of his Spirit; and to a "company" of them, a collection of goodly
ones, as Egyptian ones, reckoned the best; and those in Pharaoh's
chariot best of all; choice, costly, well fed, and well taken care of;
and not wild and loose, but coupled and joined together in a chariot,
all drawing one way. Christ's church and people are a choice and select
company, distinguished from others by the grace of God; cost a great
price, the blood of Christ; are well fed with the finest of the wheat;
and are under the care both of angels and Gospel ministers; and look
very beautiful as under the yoke of Christ, and joined together in
Gospel bonds, being of the same faith and judgment; drawing one way,
striving together for the faith of the Gospel, and endeavouring to keep
the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace.

Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels,.... Or "beautiful as
turtledoves", as the Septuagint; or it may be rendered "with turtles",
since the word "jewels" is not in the text; not with images of turtles
on the bridles of the horses before mentioned, as Aben Ezra; but rather
some ornaments of women having such images on them may be meant, called
"turtles", or "turturellas"; they seem to me to be the same with the
earrings, which being fastened to a thin plate of gold or silver, which
went across the forehead, or to a ribbon bound on it, as Aben Ezra on
[Gen 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#022.md); observes, hung down by the
ears in rows on both sides of the cheeks, and made but one ornament; as
they did when another jewel from the same plate or ribbon hung down from
the forehead to the nose, called a nose jewel, [Eze
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#012); (a.md); and such an ornament,
consisting of these several parts, Abraham's servant is said to put upon
the face or cheeks of Rebekah, [Gen
24:47](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#047.md); and these may respect the gifts
and graces of the Spirit of God, with which the church is ornamented;
and are many and various, and are orderly and regularly disposed, and
make very comely and lovely, and may be further described in the next
clause;

thy neck with chains of gold; the word "gold" not being in the text, the
chains may be understood, as they commonly are by the Jewish writers, of
precious stones; as pearls bored and strung, which make a necklace; so
Stockius (b) interprets it of an ornament of pearls and precious stones,
orderly disposed and put about the neck, in use with great personages;
so the eldest daughter of Priamus had, "collo monile baccatum" (c), a
pearl necklace, which Aeneas made a present of to Dido; such was the
chain of gold, beset with amber, presented to Penelope by her suitors,
which shone like the sun (d). The church has her golden chain, or pearl
necklace; which are either the graces of the Spirit, so linked together,
that where there is one there are all; and which consists of those ten
links, or pearls, faith, hope, love, repentance, humility, patience,
self-denial, contentment in every state, spiritual knowledge,
longsuffering, or forbearance; sincerity goes through them all. Or else
the spiritual blessings of the covenant of grace, with which the church
and all the saints are blessed in Christ at once, and with one and all;
and which golden chain of salvation, one link of which cannot be broken,
is excellently described by the apostle in [Rom
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030.md).

We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver. Christ here in
his own name, and in the name of the other two divine Persons, promises
to the church a greater glory than as yet she had enjoyed; and seems to
have respect to the Gospel dispensation; for by "golden borders" studded
with "silver" may be meant the ordinances of the Gospel, preferable to
those under the law; and therefore said to be of "gold and silver", for
their glory, splendour, and durableness: or else the doctrines of the
Gospel, being of more worth than thousands of gold and silver; and being
called "borders", or rather "rows" (e), may denote their orderly
disposition and connection, their harmony and agreement with and
dependence on each other: and the Gospel is full of silver "specks" or
"studs" of exceeding great and precious promises; a variety of them
useful and pleasant; a greater measure of the grace of the Spirit may be
here promised: or the "borders" may intend the groundwork of the
church's faith and hope, the justifying righteousness of Christ, more
clearly revealed; and the "studs of silver" the curious work of
sanctification, more enlarged and increased; and so take in both
Christ's righteousness imputed to her, and his grace implanted in her;
but perhaps these phrases may be best of all understood of the New
Jerusalem state, and of the ultimate glory of the saints in heaven,
sometimes set forth by such similes, [Isa
54:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#011.md). Both grace and glory are given
by Christ, and in which all the three divine Persons are concerned; for
not angels, nor the daughters of Jerusalem, are here the speakers, to
whom such things promised cannot agree; nor God, speaking after the
manner of men, and for honour's sake, is designed: but the trinity of
Persons, Father, Son, and Spirit, are meant; the ordinances are of their
institution, and administered in their name, [Mat
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019.md); they have all a concern it, the
Gospel and the doctrines of it, which is called the Gospel of God, and
the Gospel, of Christ, and the ministering of the Spirit; the grace of
God, in regeneration and conversion, is sometimes ascribed to one and
sometimes to another; and an increase of it in the heart is wished for
from all three, [Rev 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#004.md); and they
have a hand in all the glory the saints shall enjoy hereafter: the
Father has prepared the kingdom from the foundation of the world; the
Son has made way for it by his obedience, sufferings, and death; and the
Spirit is the earnest of it, makes meet for it, and introduces into it.

While the King sitteth at his table,.... These are the words of the
church, relating what influence the presence of Christ, her Lord and
King, had upon the exercise of her graces, while he was keeping the
nuptial feast, on account of his marriage with her. He was anointed King
of saints from eternity, before his incarnation, when he was rejoicing
before God his Father, as if at a feast; and while he was thus distant,
the faith, hope, desire, and expectation of the saints, were exercised
on him, as their Lord and King, that was to come: when he did come, he
came as a King, as was foretold of him, though his kingdom was not of
this world; and while he was here, the Gospel of the kingdom of heaven
was preached, and emitted a sweet savour in Judea: and when he went up
to heaven, after his resurrection, he was declared Lord and Christ, and
sat down at the right hand of God, "in his circuit" (f), or at his round
table; alluding to such the ancients used, and great personages fed on,
peculiar to themselves (g); being encircled by angels and glorified
saints: and in the mean while, before his second coming as King, when he
will appear as such in a more glorious manner, he sits down at his
table, in the ordinance of the supper, feasting with, entertaining, and
welcoming his church and people. When as follows, she says,

my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof: or "nard", of which there
are many sorts; but that which grows in spikes is reckoned the best, and
from thence is called "spikenard": it was a chief ingredient in
ointments, as Pliny says (h); see [Joh
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#003.md); and was much used at festivals,
to anoint guests with; and with which their head and hair being
anointed, gave a fragrant smell, and therefore used to make them
acceptable (i): in Syria, at royal banquets, as this here was, it was
usual to go round the guests, to sprinkle them with Babylonian ointment
(k). This may have respect to the grace of the Spirit in the church,
comparable to the most excellent ointment; and which grace being in
exercise in her, both before and after the incarnation of Christ, and
since his ascension to heaven, and while he grants his presence in
Gospel ordinances, is very delightful and acceptable to Christ; or this
spikenard, according to some (l), may be meant of Christ himself, just
as he is said to be "a bundle of myrrh" in [Sol
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#013.md), and "a cluster of camphire", in
[Sol 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#014.md); and as ointments were used
at feasts, and the church was at one with Christ, and as he was both
master and feast, so he was the ointment of spikenard to her; and it is
as if she should say, my beloved is at table with me; he is my food, and
he is my spikenard (m) I need no other; he is instead of spikenard,
myrrh, cypress, or any unguents made of these: his person is exceeding
precious; his graces, of ointments, have a delightful savour in them;
his sacrifice is of a sweet odour; his garments of righteousness and
salvation smell of myrrh, aloes, and cassia; he is all in all.

A bundle of myrrh is my well beloved unto me,.... These are the words of
the church continued; expressing her great delight in Christ, and her
strong love and affection for him, and therefore calls him "my well
beloved"; which is expressive both of the greatness of Christ's love to
her, and of the strength of her affection to him, as well as of her
faith of interest in him; hence she says, he was as "a bundle of myrrh"
to her. Some think (n) sweet marjoram is meant, or an herb of a sweet
smell, very much like it, called "marum"; but myrrh is commonly
understood; and not twigs or branches of it but sprigs, or the flowers
of it, bound up as a nosegay, and carried in the bosom; or better,
liquid myrrh, or "stacte", as the Septuagint render it, put in a bag (o)
or bottle, as the word is rendered, [Job
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#007.md); the allusion being to persons
that carry smelling bottles in their bosoms, for refreshment or for
pleasure. Now what these were to such, that, and much more, is Christ to
his church; like sweet smelling myrrh, exceeding delightful and
reviving, and make him very acceptable; his very garments smell of
myrrh: and "a bundle" of this, or a bag of it, denotes the abundance of
the odours of divine grace in Christ, who is full of it, which he
communicates in great plenty: and now Christ is all this, not to any and
everyone; but to his church and people, to whom alone he is precious,
"my beloved is unto me"; which expresses not only the strength of her
affection to Christ, and the value she had for him, and the delight she
had in him; but the particular application of him to her own soul by
faith;

he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts; "it" or "he"; the bundle of
myrrh, or Christ, which comes to the same sense: by her "breasts" are
meant her heart, where Christ dwells by faith, which is the best room
the church has, and where she desires Christ might lodge; so Alshech
explains it of being in her heart: and the time in which she would have
him continue here is "all night"; meaning the night of affliction,
temptation, &c. or rather the whole time of this life, until the
everlasting day breaks; and so it is a desire of Christ's presence with
her, and of her having communion with him, as long as she lived in the
world; and between her breasts, and in her bosom she desires he might be
for an ornament to her, like sweet flowers, and for her delight and
pleasure, refreshment and comfort; and that he might be always in her
sight, and never be forgotten by her.

My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of
Engedi. Engedi was a place near Jericho, and famous for palm trees, as
that was, hence called Hazazontamar, [Ch2
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#002). Pliny (o.md) sneaking of this
place, which he calls Engadda, says, it is second to Jerusalem for
fertility and groves of palm trees; and Josephus (p) observes, that
there grew the best palm trees and opobalsam; wherefore Aben Ezra, and
other Jewish writers, think that dates, the fruit of the palm trees,
which grow in clusters, are here meant: and because the balsam tree
also, grew in this place, as observed before from Josephus, and grew in
the manner of vines, as others (q) assert; and this being said to, be in
vineyards, some have thought that that might be in, tended; but what is
valuable in it is a gum or tear, that drops from it, and not fruit in
clusters, which it bears not: nor can it be supposed that what we call
"camphire" should be meant, which grows not in clusters, and was unknown
to the ancients; nor the "cyperus", or "cypirus", as Cocceius and
others. The Septuagint version readers it "cyprus": and there was a tree
of this name which grew in Askelon in Judea, which, according to Pliny
(r), bore a white flower of a sweet smell; and which, in Italy, was
called "ligustrum", the privet tree, commended by the poets (s) for its
peculiar whiteness; and the cypress tree is reckoned by Josephus (t)
among the odoriferous trees which grew about Jericho, near to which
Engedi was. The word here used is to be found in the Misnah (u); and the
commentators (w) on it say, it is the same which, in Arabic, is called
"alhena", the cypress tree, and refer to this place; of which Dr. Shaw
(x) says,

"this beautiful and odoriferous plant, "alhenna", if it is not annually
cut, and kept low, grows ten or twelve feet high, putting out its little
flowers in clusters, which yield a most grateful smell, like camphire.''

But, after all, perhaps the Cyprus vine is here meant, which, according
to Pliny (y), was the best and largest of vines; and which, though it
grew in Cyprus, from whence it had its name, yet some plants of it might
be obtained by Solomon, and planted in the vineyards of Engedi; or there
were such there like them, and were called by the same name: Jarchi,
from an ancient exposition of theirs, relates, that the vineyards of
this place brought forth fruit four or five times a year; Alshech says
seven. Now as Christ compares himself to a vine, [Joh
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001.md); the church may compare him to a
cluster of the grapes of the Cyprus vine, reckoned the best; there being
a cluster of all perfections, divine and human, in him; and of all the
spiritual blessings of the everlasting covenant, and of all the precious
promises in it; and of all the grace of the Spirit, and the fulness of
it, which is in him. The Jews calls a man, eminent for virtue, and a
large share of knowledge, "clusters" (z); and they interpret "eschol", a
cluster, by , "a man that has all things in him" (a): such an one is
Christ, in the highest sense, having all perfections, excellencies, and
virtues, in him. Some leave the word untranslated, "copher" (b), and
which has the signification of atonement and propitiation; and so well
agrees with Christ, who is the propitiation for sin, and has made
atonement for it. Bishop Patrick observes, that the ancient Hebrew
doctors, by dividing the first word "eschol", found out the mystery of
the Messiah; considering it as if thus read, , "my beloved is unto me
the man that propitiates" or "expiates all things"; that is, all sins
and transgressions: in the Talmud (c) it is explained,

"he, whose all things are, has atoned for my iniquity;''

which Christ has done for his church and people; and which makes him
precious, and is matter of joy and gladness to them, [Rom
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#011.md), [Jo1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#002.md).

Behold, thou art fair, my love,.... These are the words of Christ,
commending the beauty and comeliness of the church, expressing his great
affection for her, and his high esteem of her; of her fairness and
beauty; see Gill on [Sol 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#005.md); see Gill
on [Sol 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#008.md); of the title of Christ's
love, as given her by him; see Gill on [Sol
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#009.md); a "behold" is prefixed to this
account her, as a note of attention, to consider her complete comeliness
in Christ, and not pore on her own blackness; and as a note of
admiration, that she who was so black and uncomely in herself should be
so fair and beautiful in his eyes, through his blood, righteousness, and
grace; and as a note of asseveration, assuring her of the truth of it,
which she might be apt to call in question; and, to prevent which, it is
also repeated,

behold, thou art fair; exceeding fair, really so, both inwardly and
outwardly; both with respect to justification and sanctification;

thou hast doves' eyes; or "eyes like doves" (d); these are taken notice
because much beauty lies in the eyes, either in the size or colour of
them (e); similes taken from doves are frequently used in this sacred
poem, both with respect to the bride and bridegroom; see [Sol
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#014.md); and it may easily be observed,
that this creature furnishes much matter for poets (f), which they apply
to lovers: and here the eyes of the bride are compared to the eyes of
doves; meaning either the ministers of the Gospel, who are to the church
what eyes are to the body; are set in the more eminent part in the
church, to order, guide, and direct the members of it; to watch over
them, lest any hurt come to them, and give warning of danger; to hold
forth the word of light to them, and instruct them how to behave in the
church and in the world: and they may be compared to the eyes of doves,
for their clearness and perspicuity in discerning Gospel truths; and for
their sincerity and simplicity, uprightness and faithfulness, in
preaching them; and for the dove like gifts of the Spirit, whereby they
are qualified for it; and for, their meekness and humility; or rather
the eyes of her understanding are meant, being spiritually enlightened;
and particularly the eye of faith by which believers take a view of
Christ, of his glory, fulness, and suitableness, and look to him alone
for life and salvation. And it may be compared to the eyes of doves for
the clearness and quickness, of it, being the evidence of things not
seen; and, for its singleness and chastity, the dove looks only to its
mate, and destroys those that look with lustful eyes on others (g);
believers, being espoused as a chaste virgin to Christ, look only to him
as their beloved, to him only for acceptance, righteousness, pardon, and
eternal life; and for its modesty and humility, excluding all boasting
in the creature, and giving all glory to Christ; and for its
beautifulness in the sight of Christ, so that he is even ravished with
it, [Sol 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#009.md).

Behold, thou art fair, my beloved,.... These are the words of the
church, giving back to Christ his commendation of her, and much in the
same words, as more properly belonging to him than her; he calls her "my
love", she calls him "my beloved": he says that she was "fair"; the same
she says of him, with a like note of wonder, attention, and
asseveration, he had prefixed to the commendation of her; suggesting,
that his fairness and beauty were essential, original, and underived,
but hers was all from him; and therefore he only ought to have the
character: he, as man, is "fairer" than the children of men; as
Mediator, is full of grace and truth, which makes him look lovely in the
eyes of his people; and, as a divine Person, is the brightness of his
Father's glory. To which she adds,

yea, pleasant; looks pleasantly, with a smiling countenance on his
people, being the image of the invisible God; pleasant to behold, as the
sun of righteousness, and Saviour of men; pleasant in all his offices
and relations; the doctrines of his Gospel are pleasant words; his ways,
his ordinances, are ways of pleasantness; and especially having his
presence, and communion with him in them; and which may be designed in
the next clause;

also our bed is green; the same with "his bed which is Solomon's"; his

an admittance to all the privileges of it: where the word is preached,
ordinances administered, souls are begotten and born again, there Christ
and his church have fellowship with each other; said to be "green", in
allusion to the strewing of beds with green herbs and leaves, and
branches of trees (h); particularly the nuptial bed, called from thence
"thalamus" (i): and it may denote the fruitfulness of the saints in
grace and holiness, like green olive trees, in the house of God: or else
numerous converts in the church, a large spiritual seed and offspring of
Christ and the church, as were in the first times of the Gospel, and
will be in the latter day: a green bed is an emblem of fruitfulness in
the conjugal state; so the Targum and Jarchi interpret it.

The beams of our house are cedar,.... Or "houses" (k); where their bed
was, and where they had fellowship and communion together. By which may
be meant particular congregations or churches, in which houses Christ
has a property, being of his building and beautifying; where he takes up
his rest and residence, and where he feeds and feasts with his people,
and to the privileges of which all the saints have a right: and by the
"beams" of these houses may be intended the ministers of the word, who
are pillars here, as James, John, and Cephas, were; and who are the
means of supporting and strengthening such communities, by their
excellent doctrines and exemplary lives: or common saints may be meant,
who are also beams and pillars in the churches of Christ; and serve
greatly to support, strengthen, and cement the spiritual building, fitly
framed together: and these being of "cedar" wood, of a pleasant smell,
and durable, may denote their gratefulness and acceptableness to Christ
and his church, in the exercise of grace, and discharge of duty; and of
their continuance and perseverance therein, having in them the
incorruptible and immortal seed of divine grace; see [Psa
92:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#012.md);

and our rafters of fir; which Pliny says (l) is the best and strongest
wood for roofing and raftering: by these may be meant the ordinances of
the Gospel, which are that to the churches as "rafters" are to a house,
the means of supporting and strengthening it; so by the ordinances
saints are supported in their spiritual state, and by them their
spiritual strength is renewed; and these being said to be of "fir",
which is a pleasant and lasting wood, may signify the delight that is
had in ordinances, and the continuance of them. Some render the word by
"cypress" (m); which is also of a pleasant smell (n), and very durable,
never admits of worms, nor ever rots, nor is ever sensible of old age
(o); and so may denote the pleasure that saints take in ordinances, and
the long continuance of them, as of the present ones, which will remain
until the second coming of Christ. Some think the "brutine" tree (p) is
meant, which Pliny calls "bruta" (q); and is near in sound to the word
here used, is much like the cypress, and of a sweet smell, like cedar;
it grows beyond Pasitigris, on Mount Zagras. Some will have it to be the
tree of paradise; and, so applied to ordinances, may signify the same as
before. The word for "rafters" is elsewhere rendered "gutters" and
"troughs" for water; and some (r) render it so here, and are so called
from water running in them: and as the grace of God is often expressed
by water, this is commonly conveyed in the use of ordinances; these are
the canals in which it runs. Moreover the same word is translated
"galleries", in [Sol 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#005.md); which, as
Kimchi and Ben Melech observe, were buildings in high houses in which
men walked from house to house, or from one end of the house to the
other; and might be called by this name, from their droning along the
sides of houses, and seem to be like our "balconies": now ordinances are
the galleries or "walking places" (s), where Christ and his people walk
and converse together.
