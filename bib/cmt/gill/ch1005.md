### [1 Chronicles Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 5:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO 1 CHRONICLES 5

This chapter relates the genealogy of the tribes that lived on the other
side Jordan; of the Reubenites, [Ch1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#001), of the Gadites, [Ch1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#011) of the half tribe of Manasseh,
[Ch1 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#023) and of their war with the
Hagarites, in conjunction with each other, and their conquest of them,
[Ch1 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#018) and who for their sins were
all carried captive by the king of Assyria, [Ch1
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#025).

[1 Chronicles 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 5:1</span></span>

Now the sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel,.... Are as follow in
[Ch1 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#003) where the account begins; for
what comes between this and that is in a parenthesis:

for he was the firstborn; of Jacob by his wife Leah; that must be owned,
and Jacob allows it, [Gen 49:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#003) and yet
the genealogy in this book begins not with him, as might on that account
be expected; the reason follows:

but forasmuch as he defiled his father's bed: by lying with Bilhah his
concubine:

his birthright was given unto the sons of Joseph the son of Israel; his
beloved son by his beloved wife Rachel and so had a double portion given
him; his two sons being equally ranked with the other sons of Jacob, and
became distinct tribes, and each had their lot in the land of Canaan,
see [Gen 48:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#005) compared with [Deu
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#017).

and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright; or, "but
the genealogy", &c. (o); neither after the birthright of Reuben, which
he had by nature, being Jacob's firstborn; nor after the birthright of
Joseph, which be had by his father's gift, as it might be thought it
should; the reason of which follows.

\(o\) "Nee tamen", Tigurine version.

[1 Chronicles 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 5:2</span></span>

For Judah prevailed above his brethren,.... That is, the tribe of Judah
prevailed above the rest in number, in valour, and courage, and in
dignity; wherefore the genealogy is not reckoned according to
birthright, but dignity and dominion; hence this genealogical account
began with Judah:

because of him came the chief ruler; David and the kings of Judah, his
successors; and above all, from him the Prince Messiah was to spring,
and did, according to [Gen 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010) so
both the Syriac and Arabic versions read,"out of Judah should go forth
the King Messiah:"

but the birthright was Joseph's or "though" (p) it was; yet Judah having
the dominion and dignity, that tribe is first genealogized.

\(p\) Licet, ibid. (Tigurine version)

[1 Chronicles 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 5:3</span></span>

The sons, I say, of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, were, Hanoch, and
Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. As in [Gen
46:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#009).

[1 Chronicles 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 5:4</span></span>

The sons of Joel,.... Who was either the son of Carmi last mentioned, or
rather of Hanoch, Reuben's firstborn, since the descendants of him were
the princes of the tribe: his posterity in succession were, Shemaiah,
Cog, Shimei, Micah, Reaia, Baal, Beerah; of whom we know no more than
their names, and by these the descent is carried down to the captivity
by Tiglathpileser, as follows.

[1 Chronicles 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 5:6</span></span>

Beerah his son,.... The last of Joel's posterity, who, according to the
Targum and other Jewish writers (q) was a prophet, and the father of
Hosea, see [Hos 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001) but neither the
name, title, time, nor tribe, agree:

whom Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria carried away captive; the same with
Tiglathpileser by a transposition of letters, [Kg2
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029) and is read the same here in the
Greek, Syriac, and Arabic versions:

he was prince of the Reubenites; at that time; that is, Beerah was.

\(q\) Aben Ezra in Hos. i. 1. Pesikta apud Abarbinel. in ib.

[1 Chronicles 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 5:7</span></span>

And his brethren by their families,.... Either the brethren of Beerah,
or the rest of the posterity of Reuben:

(when the genealogy of their generations was reckoned;) either in the
times of Jotham and Jeroboam, [Ch1
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#017) or at the time of their
captivity, as in the preceding verse:

were the chief, Jehiel, and Zechariah; these were the principals or
heads of their families.

[1 Chronicles 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 5:8</span></span>

And Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel,.... The
pedigree of Bela, another principal man in the tribe of Reuben, is
traced up to Joel the father of Shema; the same with Shemaiah, according
to Kimchi and Ben Melech, [Ch1 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#004)

who dwelt in Aroer; which belonged to the tribe of Gad, and was rebuilt
by them, [Num 32:34](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#034) wherefore Kimchi
observes, it may be interpreted, either from Aroer, or on the border of
it, Bela dwelt:

even unto Nebo, and Baalmeon; of which See Gill on [Num
32:38](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#038).

[1 Chronicles 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch1 5:9</span></span>

And eastward he inhabited,.... Either Bela, or the tribe of Reuben:

unto the entering in of the wilderness; the wilderness of Kedemoth,
which was near to Sihon king of Heshbon, whose land the Reubenites
inhabited, [Deu 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#026).

from the river Euphrates; a learned man (r) thinks that this river Phrat
was different from the Euphrates near Babylon, which was northward,
since this was to the east or southeast:

because their cattle were multiplied in the land of Gilead; therefore
their habitation was extended further, even to the river Euphrates, as
in the days of David and Solomon, [Sa2
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#003).

[1 Chronicles 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 5:10</span></span>

And in the days of Saul they made war with the Hagarites,.... Not with
the Hungarians, as the Targum, a people not then in being; but the
Ishmaelites, so called because they descended from Hagar (s), Sarah's
maid; the same that are placed by Pliny (t) and Ptolemy (u) in Arabia,
near the Batanaeans, or inhabitants of Bashan; with those the Reubenites
made war, in conjunction with the Gadites and half tribe of Manasseh,
[Ch1 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#018), perhaps this war might be
much about the time Saul relieved Jabeshgilead, and beat the Ammonites,
[Sa1 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#001) by which the tribes on that
side Jordan might be encouraged to it:

who fell by their hand; were worsted and conquered by them:

and they dwelt in their tents; in which the Arabians used to dwell,
because of their flocks; hence some of them were called Scenites:

throughout all the east land of Gilead; or rather throughout all the
land of the Hagarites, which lay to the east of Gilead, as the Vulgate
Latin version; or otherwise the land of Gilead itself was their original
possession.

[1 Chronicles 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch1 5:11</span></span>

And the children of Gad dwelt over against them,.... Or by them, the
Reubenites; and one part of Gilead was given them between them, and the
other to the half tribe of Manasseh:

in the land of Bashan, unto Salcah; for though all Bashan is said to be
given to the half tribe of Manasseh, [Deu
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#013) yet that is to be understood of
the greater part of it; all of that which belonged to Og, but what did
not, the Gadites, either from the first, or in later times, inhabited
even as far as Salcah, which was one of the cities of Og, [Deu
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#010) and which Benjamin of Tudela (w)
makes mention of, being called by the same name in his days.

[1 Chronicles 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch1 5:12</span></span>

Joel the chief,.... In this and the following verse are reckoned up the
principal men in the tribe of Gad, and the chief of all was Joel,
another from him in the tribe of Reuben, [Ch1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#004).

and Shapham the next; the second chief man, from whom, Reland (x)
conjectures, Shophan, a city in the tribe of Gad, had its name, [Num
32:35](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#035).

and Jaanai; from whom Danjaan might be called, as Michaelis intimates,
[Sa2 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#006).

and Shaphat in Bashan; not Shaphat the father of Elisha, according to a
tradition of the Jews, mentioned by Kimchi; which is not at all
probable.

[1 Chronicles 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch1 5:13</span></span>

And their brethren of the house of their fathers,.... Who were also men
of eminence and note in them:

were, Michael, and Meshullam, and Shebai, and Jorai, and Jachan, and
Zia, and Heber, seven; so they are as here mentioned by name.

[1 Chronicles 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch1 5:14</span></span>

These are the children of Abihail the son of Huri,.... That is, the
seven before mentioned; they were the posterity of Abihail, whose
pedigree is traced from his father Huri to Buz, the intermediate
progenitors being Jaroah, Gilead, Michael, Jeshishai, Jahdo.

[1 Chronicles 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch1 5:15</span></span>

Ahi the son of Abdiel, the son of Guni, chief of the house of their
fathers. Which Ahi was a principal man in the families the seven above
men belonged to; besides them, or those three, were everyone of them
heads of families.

[1 Chronicles 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 5:16</span></span>

And they dwelt in Gilead,.... In that part of it which belonged to the
tribe of Gad:

in Bashan, and in her towns; See Gill on [Ch1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#011),

and in all the suburbs of Sharon, upon their borders; there were two
Sharons, one to the west of the land of Israel near the Mediterranean
sea, which is mentioned in [Act 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#035)
as near Lydda and Joppa; and the other to the east or northeast, beyond
Jordan, which is here meant.

[1 Chronicles 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 5:17</span></span>

All these were reckoned by genealogies,.... All before mentioned:

in the days of Jotham king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam king of
Israel; not that those two kings reigned at the same time, and one and
the same reckoning is meant; but, as Dr. Lightfoot (y) observes, there
were two reckonings; his words are,"in the days of Jotham there was an
account taken of the families of Reuben, Gad, and half Manasseh, [Ch1
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#017) and so had there been in the days
of Jeroboam the second; then at their restoring by Jeroboam out of the
hands of Hamath and Syria, and now at their arming against the Assyrian,
under whom they fell in the time of Pekah, and are never again restored
to Israel.''

[1 Chronicles 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 5:18</span></span>

The sons of Reuben, and the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh,....
These all joined together, living together on the one side of Jordan:

of valiant men, men able to bear buckler and sword, and to shoot with
bow, and skilful in war; strong able bodied men; and not only able to
bear and carry arms, sword in one hand, and shield in another; but were
men of valour and courage, and had military skill, and knew how to
handle their arms to advantage:

were four and forty thousand seven hundred and threescore, that went out
to the war: that used to go out when there was occasion, and did at this
time.

[1 Chronicles 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch1 5:19</span></span>

And they made war with the Hagarites,.... Before mentioned, [Ch1
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#019).

with Jetur, and Nephish: with the posterity of these men, who were sons
of Ishmael, [Gen 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#015) and so was
Nodab; perhaps the same with Kedemah, mentioned along with the other two
there; so Hillerus (z) thinks.

[1 Chronicles 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 5:20</span></span>

And they were helped against them,.... The Israelites were helped
against the Ishmaelites, to fight with them, and overcome them; either
by their brethren of the house of Israel, as the Targum, those on this
side Jordan; or rather by the Lord, to whom they cried, and who was
entreated by them as follows:

and the Hagarites were delivered into their hand, and all that were with
them; they and their confederates and auxiliaries, the Ituraeans, &c.

for they cried to God in the battle; which at first seems to have gone
against them; and they prayed to God, as the Targum, while they were
fighting, that he would appear for them, and give them victory:

and he was entreated of them; he received their prayer, as the same
paraphrase; he heard them, and answered them:

because they put their trust in him; in his power and providence, and
not in their own strength, courage, and military skill; the Targum
is,"because they trusted in his word.''

[1 Chronicles 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch1 5:21</span></span>

And they took away their cattle,.... Which they brought with them, and
they found in their camp when they fled, or in their fields:

of their camels fifty thousand; with which Arabia abounded, and were fit
to travel with in those hot and desert countries, being strong to carry
burdens, and able to bear much thirst. The Arabians, as Diodorus Siculus
(a) reports, brought up camels, for almost all the uses of life; as for
the sake of their milk and flesh to feed upon, as well as for carrying
burdens in common; and which in time of war they loaded with provisions
for the army, and fought upon, one of them carrying two archers with
their backs to each other, the one to meet the enemy in front, the other
to annoy those that pursued them; and so the Parthians made use of
camels both to fight on, and to carry provisions for their soldiers (b):

and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand; which these Hagarites kept
both for food and clothing, and some of them might be now taken with
them to supply their army; the Spartans carried sheep with them in their
expeditions, as sacrifices to their gods (c); but it need not be
supposed that these creatures, and those that follow, were in such large
numbers with the Hagarites in the battle, but were afterwards found,
partly in their camp, and partly in the places inhabited by them:

and of asses two thousand; used to ride on, and carry loads, and also to
plough with; and in all these lay the wealth of men in those times and
countries, see [Job 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001).

and of men one hundred thousand; so that they took captive above as many
more as their army consisted of.

[1 Chronicles 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 5:22</span></span>

For there fell down many slain,.... Many were killed in the battle,
besides the great number of prisoners made, so that the army the
Ishmaelites brought into the field was very great:

because the war was of God; or from the Word of the Lord, as the Targum;
he stirred up the Israelites to it, directed, assisted, and succeeded
them, that vengeance might be taken on this wicked and idolatrous
people:

and they dwelt in their stead until the captivity; the Targum adds, of
Sennacherib king of Assyria; but this captivity of the tribes referred
to was not by him, but by Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria, [Ch1
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#026) and they dwelt not in the country
of the Arab-hagarites, or Ishmaelites in their stead there, but in
Gilead, as in [Ch1 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#010) which belonged
to the Gadites and Reubenites originally, but had been dispossessed of
it, or however distressed in it by these Hagarites, which they now drove
out, and dwelt in their stead; for as for the Scenite-arabs or
Ishmaelites, they never were conquered and brought into subjection by
any people, but always maintained their independency (d); and lived upon
the plunder of their neighbours, pitching their tents here and there for
their convenience, which in these parts were at this time spoiled.

\(d\) See the notes on Gen. xvi. 12. and Dan. xi. 41. and a dissertation
upon the independency of the Arabs, at the end of the Universal History,
vol. 20. See Gill on [Gen 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#012). See

[1 Chronicles 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch1 5:23</span></span>

And the children of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the land,....
Not in the land of the Hagarites, but in the land of Gilead and Bashan
beyond Jordan, given them by Moses. The writer, having reckoned the
genealogies of some of the principal men of Reuben and Gad, proceeds to
give a short account of some principal men in this half tribe:

they increased from Bashan; where they first settled, and extended their
possessions:

unto Baalhermon and Senir, and unto Mount Hermon; mountains which lay to
the north of the land of Canaan, and are what geographers call
Antilibanus.

[1 Chronicles 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch1 5:24</span></span>

And these were the heads of the house of their fathers,.... Some of the
principal men of this half tribe:

even Epher, and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and Jeremiah, and Hodaviah,
and Jahdiel; but of none of these we read elsewhere, excepting Hepher
and Azriel, [Num 26:31](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#031).

mighty men of valour, famous men, and heads of the house of their
fathers; men that obtained a name for their strength, courage, and
valour, and military exploits, and were the chiefs of the families in
this half tribe, and by whom they were denominated; so from Hepher were
the family of the Hepherites, and from Azriel the family of the
Azrielites, as in the place before quoted.

[1 Chronicles 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch1 5:25</span></span>

And they transgressed against the God their fathers,.... Against his
law, will, word, and ordinances, not only the half tribe of Manasseh,
hut the Reubenites and Gadites also:

and went a whoring after the gods of the people of the land, whom God
destroyed before them; that is, committed idolatry, which is spiritual
fornication or whoredom; worshipped the idols either of the Amorites,
who were destroyed by the Lord to make way for their first settlement;
or of the Ishmaelites, whom they conquered, and whose land they dwelt in
to the captivity.

[1 Chronicles 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch1 5:26</span></span>

And the God of Israel,.... The Targum is,"the word of the God of
Israel:"

stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria: in the times of Menahem
king of Israel:

and the spirit of Tilgathpilneser; in the times of Pekah king of Israel,
to invade the land, and make war in it:

and he carried them away: not the former, but the latter:

even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh;
these entirely together, with some other parts of the land, see [Kg2
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029).

and brought them unto Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river
Gozan; to the very same places where afterwards Salmaneser carried the
ten tribes, or what remained of them, see [Kg2
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006).

unto this day; the times of Ezra, the writer of this book, after the
tribe of Judah returned from the captivity of Babylon; but the ten
tribes remained where they were carried, and have not returned even to
this day.
