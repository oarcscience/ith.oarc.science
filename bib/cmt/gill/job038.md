INTRODUCTION TO JOB 38

In this chapter the Lord takes up the controversy with Job; calls upon
him to prepare to engage with him in it, and demands an answer to posing
questions he puts to him, concerning the earth and the fabric of it,
[Job 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#001.md); concerning the sea,
compared to an infant in embryo, at its birth, in its swaddling bands
and cradle, [Job 38:8](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#008.md); concerning the
morning light, its spread and influence, [Job
38:12](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#012.md); concerning the springs of the
sea, the dark parts of the earth, the place both of light and darkness,
[Job 38:16](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#016.md); concerning the various
meteors, snow, hail, rain, thunder, lightning, and the influences of the
stars, [Job 38:22](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#022.md); and concerning
provision for lions and ravens, [Job
38:40](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#040.md).

[Job 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 38:1</span></span>

Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind,.... As soon as Elihu
had done speaking, who saw the tempest rising, and gave hints of it,
[Job 37:2](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#002.md); and hastened to finish his
discourse. This was raised to give notice of the Lord being about to
appear, and to display his majesty, and to command reverence and
attention. The Targum calls it the whirlwind of distress, as it might be
to Job; and a representation of the distressed and disturbed state and
condition in which he was. The person that spoke out of it is Jehovah
the Son of God, the eternal Word, who very probably appeared in an human
form; there was an object seen, [Job
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#005.md); and spoke with an articulate
voice to Job;

and said; in answer to his frequent wishes and desires that the Lord
would appear and take his cause in hand.

[Job 38:2](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 38:2</span></span>

Who is this,.... Meaning not Elihu the last speaker, as some think; and
there are some who suppose not only that these words are directed to
him, but all that is said in this and the following chapter: but it was
Job the Lord spoke to and answered, as expressed in [Job
38:1](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#001.md); and these words are taken by Job
to himself, [Job 42:3](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#003.md). Concerning whom
the Lord inquires, not as ignorant of him, who he was; but wondering
that such a man as he should talk as he did; and as angry with him, and
rebuking him for it;

that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge? either his own
counsel, his sense and sentiments of things, which were delivered in
such an obscure manner as not to be intelligible by those that heard
them; whereby they were led, as Job's friends were, into some mistaken
notions of him: or rather the counsel of God, his works of providence,
which are done according to the counsel of his will, and were
misrepresented by Job, as not being wise and good, just and equitable;
see [Job 34:3](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#003.md).

[Job 38:3](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 38:3</span></span>

Gird up now thy loins like a man,.... Like a man of valour that girds on
his harness for battle: Job is bid to prepare for the controversy the
Lord was entering into with him; and bring forth his strong reasons and
most powerful arguments in his own defence. The allusion is to the
custom in the eastern countries, where they wore long garments, to gird
them about their loins, when they engaged in work or war. Job had
blustered what he would do, and now he is dared to it; see [Job
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#004.md);

for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me; put questions to him, to
which he required a direct and positive answer. Jehovah takes the part
of the opponent in this dispute, and gives that of the respondent to
Job; since Job himself had put it to his option which to take, [Job
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#022.md).

[Job 38:4](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 38:4</span></span>

Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?.... The earth
has foundations, and such firm ones that it cannot be moved; but what
are they, since it is hung in the air on nothing! No other than the
power and will of God, who laid these foundations, and the Son of God,
who has created and upholds all things by the word of his power, [Heb
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md). Where was Job then? In a state of
nothingness, a mere nonentity: he was not present when this amazing work
of nature was done, and saw not how the Lord went about it; and yet
takes upon him to dive into the secret works and ways of Providence, for
which he is rebuked by this question and the following;

declare, if thou hast understanding: Job had the understanding of a man
in things natural and civil, and of a good man in things spiritual and
divine; but he had no understanding of this, of what he is questioned
about; could not declare in what place he was, and where he stood, when
the earth was founded.

[Job 38:5](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 38:5</span></span>

Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest?.... Did God or a
creature? The Lord, no doubt. He laid them out in his divine mind, and
laid them forth by his divine power; who does all things by weight and
measure. He fixed the dimensions of the earth, how long, how thick, and
how broad it should be; he settled the borders and boundaries of it.
This Job might know that the Lord did; but he laid them, and what they
are that are laid, he knew not. Mathematicians pretend to give us the
circumference and diameter of the earth; but in their accounts are not
agreed, but widely differ; which shows they are at no certainty about
them (e); and Job and the men of his age might be still less knowing:
though the words may be rendered, "for thou knowest" (f); surely such a
knowing man as thou art must needs know this and so are a severe sarcasm
upon him;

or who hath stretched the line upon it? The measuring line being formed
according to rule, with exact symmetry and proportion. This may be the
same with the circle of the earth, and the compass set upon the face of
the deep or terraqueous globe, [Pro
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#027.md). And with the same exactness and
just proportion are the ways and works of Providence, which Job ought to
have acquiesced in as being well and wisely done.

\(e\) The mathematicians in Aristotle's time reckoned the breadth of the
earth a little less than forty myriads of furlongs, and the length of it
seventy myriads. Aristot. de Mundo, c. 3. Vid. Plin. Nat. Hist. l. 2. c.
108, 109. According to the moderns, the circumference of the earth is
25,031.5 of our statute miles, and its diameter 7967 such miles. See
Chamber's Dictionary on the word "Earth". (f) "quadoquidem", Junius &
Tremellius, Piscator; "quia", Michaelis; "nam", Schultens; so Broughton.

[Job 38:6](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 38:6</span></span>

Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened?.... Or the pillars of
it, as Ben Gersom interprets it; see [Psa
75:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#003.md); and which Aben Ezra understands
of the mountains: but be they what they may, on what can they be
fastened or sunk into, when the earth hangs on nothing, and there is
nothing visible to support it, nothing but the mighty hand of God?

or who laid the corner stone thereof? which unites, cements, and keeps
the fabric together, and is the ornament and beauty of it; but who can
tell what that is? Aben Ezra interprets it of the point or centre of the
earth.

[Job 38:7](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 38:7</span></span>

When the morning stars sang together,.... Either all the stars in a
literal sense; for though, strictly speaking, there is but one morning
star, yet all may be called so, because early created in the morning of
the world; and are all stars of light, shine till the morning; and it is
observed by some, that the nearer the morning the brighter they shine:
and these in their way sing the praises of God, and set forth the glory
of his perfections, and occasion songs of praise in men; see [Psa
148:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#003.md). Or figuratively, either angels,
as most interpret them, comparable to stars for their glory, purity, and
light, for their constancy, permanency, and numbers: or good men,
particularly ministers of the word, and angels of the churches; who are
stars in Christ's right hand, [Rev
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#020.md); but the principal morning star
is Christ himself, [Rev 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#016.md);

and all the sons of God shouted for joy; which are usually understood of
angels also, so the Targum; who are the sons of God, not by birth, as
Christ, nor by adoption, as saints; but by creation, as Adam, [Luk
3:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#038.md). And because they bear some
likeness to God, as holy spirits, and honour and obey him in doing his
will; though the character of sons of God, as distinct from the children
of men, given to professors of religion, obtained before the times of
Job; see [Gen 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#002.md); and who might be
said to sing together, and shout for joy, when they met for social
worship; see [Job 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#006.md); and especially
when any fresh discoveries were made to them of the Messiah, and
salvation by him. Thus Abraham, one of these sons of God, saw Christ's
day and was glad, and shouted for joy, [Joh
8:56](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#056.md). For these words are not
necessarily to be restrained to the laying of the foundation and
cornerstone of the earth, as our version directs; though indeed the
angels then might be present, being created as soon as the heavens were,
and with the stars, as Capellus on this place observes; and rejoiced,
when the foundations of the earth were laid, on beholding such a display
of the power, wisdom, and goodness of God therein; and which may be said
of them, in allusion to what is done at the laying of the foundation of
any building of note; see [Ezr 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#010.md);
for it may be repeated from [Job 38:4](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#004.md);
"where wast thou when the morning stars", &c. and so may refer to any
rejoicing, whether of angels or men, before the times of Job, at which
he was not present.

[Job 38:8](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 38:8</span></span>

Or who shut up the sea with doors,.... From the earth the transition is
to the sea, according to the order of the creation; and this refers not
to the state and case of the sea as at the flood, of which some
interpret it, but as at its first creation; and it is throughout this
account represented as an infant, and here first as in embryo, shut up
in the bowels of the earth, where it was when first created with it, as
an infant shut up in its mother's womb, and with the doors of it; see
[Job 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#010.md); the bowels of the earth
being the storehouses where God first laid up the deep waters, [Psa
33:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#007.md); and when the chaos, the
misshapen earth, was like a woman big with child;

when it brake forth out of the abyss, as the Targum, with force and
violence, as Pharez broke out of his mother's womb; for which reason he
had his name given, which signifies a breach, [Gen
38:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#029.md); so it follows,

as if it had issued out of the womb; as a child out of its mother's
womb; so the sea burst forth and issued out of the bowels of the earth,
and covered it all around, as in [Psa
104:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#006.md); and now it was that the Spirit
of God moved upon the face of the waters, before they were drained off
the earth; this was the first open visible production of the sea, and
nay be called the birth of it; see [Gen
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002.md). Something like this the Heathen
philosopher Archelaus had a notion of, who says (g), the sea was shut up
in hollow places, and was as it were strained through the earth.

\(g\) Laert. Vit. Philosoph. l. 2. p. 99.

[Job 38:9](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 38:9</span></span>

When I made the cloud the garment thereof,.... For this newborn babe,
the sea;

and thick darkness a swaddling band for it; which was the case of the
sea when it burst out of the bowels of the earth and covered it, for
then darkness was upon the face of the deep, a dark, foggy, misty air,
[Gen 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002.md); and this was before its
separation from the land, and in this order it stands in this account;
though since, clouds, fogs, and mists, which rise out of the sea, are as
garments to it, and cover it at times, and the surrounding atmosphere,
as it presses the whole terraqueous globe, and keeps the parts of the
earth together, so the waters of the sea from spilling out; and these
are the garments and the swaddling bands with which the hands and arms
of this big and boisterous creature are wreathed; it is said of the
infant in [Eze 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#004.md) that it was
neither "salted nor swaddled at all"; but both may be said of the sea;
that it is salted is sufficiently known, and that it is swaddled is here
affirmed; but who except the Lord Almighty could do this? and who has
managed, and still does and can manage, this unruly creature, as easily
as a nurse can turn about and swaddle a newborn babe upon her lap.

[Job 38:10](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 38:10</span></span>

And brake up for it my decreed place,.... Or, as Mr. Broughton
translates it, "and brake the earth for it by my decree": made a vast
chasm in the earth to hold the waters of the sea, which was provided as
a sort of cradle to put this swaddled infant in; God cleaved the earth,
raised the hills and sank the valleys, which became as channels to
convey the waters that ran off the earth to their appointed place, which
beautifully expressed in [Psa 104:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#007.md);
and refers there, as here, to the work of creation on the second day,
[Gen 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#009) (h.md);

and set bars and doors; to keep it in its decreed appointed place, that
the waters might not go over the earth; these are the shores, as the
Targum, the cliffs and rocks upon them, the boundaries of the sea; to
which may be added, and what is amazing, the sand upon the seashore is
such a boundary to it that it cannot pass, [Jer
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#022.md); but these would be insufficient
was it not for the power and will of God, next expressed.

\(h\) Or determined, that is, appointed for it its convenient, proper,
and fixed place; so David de Pomis, Lexic. fol. 203. 1.

[Job 38:11](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 38:11</span></span>

And said, hitherto shalt thou come, but no further,.... The waters of
the sea shall spread themselves to such and such shores, and wash them,
but go no further; its rolling tides shall go up so far in rivers that
go out of it, and then return, keeping exactly to time and place; this
is said by Jehovah, the Word of God, and through his almighty power is
tended to;

and here shall thy proud waves be stayed; so high and no higher shall
they lift up themselves; so far and no farther shall they roll on, than
to the boundaries fixed for them; and though they may toss up themselves
as proud men toss up their heads, for which, reason pride is ascribed to
them, yet they shall not prevail, [Jer
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#022.md); all this may be accommodated to
the afflictions of God's people, which are sometimes compared to the
waves and billows of the sea, [Psa
42:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#007.md); and these issue out of the womb
of God's purposes and decrees, and are not the effects of chance; they
are many, and threaten to overwhelm, but God is with his people in them,
and preserves them from being overflowed by them; he has set the bounds
and measures of them, beyond which they cannot go; see [Isa
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#008.md); and also to the world, and to
the men of it, who are like a troubled sea, [Dan
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#002.md); and who rise, and swell, and dash
against the people of God, being separated from them who were originally
mixed with them; but the Lord restrains their wrath and fury, and
suffers them not to do his people any harm; whom he has placed in the
munition of rocks out of their reach, that those proud waters cannot go
over them as they threaten to do; see [Psa
76:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#010.md).

[Job 38:12](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 38:12</span></span>

Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days;.... Job had lived to see
many a morning, but it never was in his power to command one; he had
been in such circumstances as to wish for morning light before it was,
but was obliged to wait for it, could not hasten it, or cause it to
spring before its time; see [Job 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#003.md);
one of the Targums is,

"wast thou in the days of the first creation, and commandedst the
morning to be?''

he was not, God was; he was before the first morning, and commanded it
into being, [Gen 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#003.md);

and caused the dayspring to know his place; the first spring of light or
dawn of day; which though it has a different place every day in the
year, as the sun ascends or descends in the signs of the Zodiac, yet it
knows and observes its exact place, being taught of God.

[Job 38:13](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 38:13</span></span>

That it might take hold of the ends of the earth,.... As when the
morning light springs forth, it quickly does, reaching in a short time
the extreme part of the hemisphere; which, and what goes before, may be
applied to the light of the Gospel, and the direction of that under
divine Providence in the several parts of the world, and unto the ends
of it; see [Psa 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#004.md);

that the wicked might be shaken out of it? the earth, by means of the
light; which may be understood either of wicked men who have been all
night upon works of darkness, and be take themselves on the approach of
light to private lurking places, like beasts of prey, so that the earth
seems to be, as it were, clear of them; or of their being taken up in
the morning for deeds done in the night, and brought to justice, which
used to be exercised in mornings, [Jer
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#012.md); and so the earth rid of them:
thus wicked men shun the light, of the Gospel, and are condemned by it;
and in the latter day light and glory they will cease from the earth;
see [Joh 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019.md).

[Job 38:14](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 38:14</span></span>

It is turned as clay to the seal,.... As the clay receives a different
form by the impress of the seal upon it, so the earth appears in a
different manner by the spring of morning light upon it; in the darkness
of the night nothing of its form and beauty is to be seen; it is a mere
"tohu" and "bohu", like the chaos, [Gen
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002.md); its rising hills, and spreading
dales, and beautiful landscapes, cannot be observed with pleasure; but
when the light breaks forth in the morning, it is seen in all its beauty
and glory: of the change the light of the Gospel makes in men, see [Co2
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#018.md);

and they stand as a garment; or things stand upon it as a garment, as
Mr. Broughton renders the words; herbs, plants, and trees, unseen in the
night, stand up like a vesture to the earth in the morning light; and as
they are clothed themselves, they are a garment to that, which now puts
on another and beautiful habit; the pastures are clothed with flocks,
and the valleys covered with corn, and the whole earth with light
itself, as with a garment: and as beautifully do men made light in the
Lord appear; see [Isa 41:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#010.md).

[Job 38:15](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 38:15</span></span>

And from the wicked their light is withholden,.... Whose light is
darkness, and whose day is the night, of which they are deprived when
the morning light breaks forth; see [Job
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#017.md); it may be figuratively
understood of the light of prosperity being removed from them, or the
light of life, when they shall be sent into utter darkness;

and the high arm shall be broken; their power weakened and made useless;
even the power of such wicked men who have had a large share of it, and
have used it in a tyrannical manner; and especially this will be their
case at death; see [Isa 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#010.md).

[Job 38:16](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 38:16</span></span>

Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea?.... The subterraneous
passages through which the waters flow into the sea and supply it; or
the springs and fountains that rise up at the bottom of it (i); and some
tell us of springs of sweet water that rise there, even though the water
at the bottom of the sea is saltier than on the surface (k): some render
it "the drops of the sea" (l); hast thou considered them and counted
them? art thou able to do it? no: others the "perplexities" of it (m),
so the Targum, the word being used in this sense, [Exo
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#003.md); the thickets of it; some speak
of woods and forests in it; see Gill on [Exo
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#019); others "rocks" and shelves (n.md),
and others the "borders" of it (o); and the sense then is, hast thou
entered into and travelled through the main ocean, observed the forests
in it, the shelving rocks and sandy mountains in it, and gone to the
utmost borders of it?

or hast thou walked in the search of the depth? to find out the deepest
place of it, where no sounding line can reach (p); or walked in quest of
the curiosities of it, animals, plants and minerals, unknown to men; or
of the riches that lie at the bottom of it, for which now the diving
bell is used, but not invented and known in the times of Job; and if Job
had not done and could not do all this, how should he be able to enter
into the secret springs of Providence, or trace the ways of God, whose
way is in the sea, and whose paths are in the great waters, and his
footsteps not known? [Psa 77:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#019.md).

\(i\) According to Dr. Plot, the principal fountains have their origin,
and are supplied with water through subterraneous passages from the sea.
De Origine Fontium, &c. apud Act. Erudit. Lips. A. M. 1685. p. 538. See
Gen vii. 11. (k) Vid. Scheucbzer. Physic. Sacr. vol. 4. p. 803. (l)
"guttas maris", Tigurine version, Grotius. (m) "Perplexitates maris",
Munster. (n) "Scopulos maris", Michaelis; "salebrosa maris", Schultens.
(o) So Jarchi. (p) For though the greatest depth of the sea is said by
Fabianus (apud Plin. Nat. Hist. l. 2, c. 102.) to be fifteen furlongs,
or near two miles, this must be understood of that part of it which is
fathomable and nearer land. But such as those, called Bathea Ponti, the
depths of the Pontus, and are almost three hundred furlongs from the
continent, they are said (Plin. ib.) to be of an immense depth, and the
bottom not to be found. And if the Sardinian sea, the deepest in the
Mediterranean (Aristot. Meteorolog. l. 2, c. 1.) is a thousand orgies or
fathoms deep, (Posidonius apud Strabo. Geograph. l. 1, p. 37.) that is,
one mile and a fifth, what must the depth of the vast ocean be?

[Job 38:17](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 38:17</span></span>

Have the gates of death been opened unto thee?.... Meaning not by which
death has entered into the world, and which have been the causes and
occasion of it; as the sin of man, the appointment of God, and various
providences, calamities and diseases; but by which men enter into the
state of the dead. Men know not experimentally what death is, nor in
what way they shall go out of the world, nor at what time, nor in what
place; they know not what the state of the dead is, there is no
correspondence between them and the living; they do not know either what
they enjoy or endure, or who precisely and with certainty are in the
separate abodes of bliss or misery; the gates of these dark and
invisible regions to us have never been thrown open, for mortals to look
into them;

or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death? the same thing in
other words; the Targum and Jarchi interpret this of hell.

Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth?.... Which may be put for
all the dimensions of it, length, breadth, diameter, and circumference,
but especially it regards the surface of it, and the measurement of
that; hast thou gone over the whole face of the earth and measured it,
all its parts, its hills and dales, rocks and mountains, and took a
survey of all the cities, towns and villages, woods, forests, fountains,
rivers, &c? no; if a man lived as long as Methuselah, and spent all his
days in this way, he could never be able to do it; and some parts are
inaccessible, and not to be measured by the most skilful geometer;

declare, if thou knowest it all; the whole earth and every part of it,
and all that is in it. Whether the other hemisphere and the antipodes
were known in Job's time is a question; however not America, or the new
world, which is a late discovery; and even now, in our most exact maps
of the world, some parts are marked with "terra incognita", the unknown
land.

[Job 38:19](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 38:19</span></span>

Where is the way where light dwelleth?.... Or the way to the place where
it dwells, and what that is;

and as for darkness, where is the place thereof? where these were placed
when they were first separated at the creation? where light goes and
dwells, when it departs from us at sun setting? and where the darkness
betakes itself, and makes its abode at sun rising? What is the chamber
of the sun, and the tabernacle of it? from whence it sets out, and
whither it returns? And though these questions may be answered by
geographers and astronomers in their way; yet they seem to respect
chiefly the disposal of light and darkness, in such a manner as to cause
the revolution of them, and the inequality of days and nights in
different seasons and climates; and which is not in the power of men to
effect, but depends on the sovereign will of God.

[Job 38:20](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 38:20</span></span>

That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof,.... Either darkness,
or rather the light; take it as it were by the hand, and guide and
direct its course to its utmost bound. This only the Lord can do and
does: he has set a tabernacle for the sun, which goes forth at his
command as a strong man to run a race; whose going forth is from the end
of the heavens, and his circuit unto the ends of it: in which his course
is so steered and directed by the Lord, that he never misses his way or
errs from it; but keeps his path exactly, as well as knows its rising
and setting, its utmost bounds;

and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof? from whence
it sets out, and whither it returns; see [Psa
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#004.md). And so the light and darkness of
prosperity and adversity, as well as natural light and darkness, are of
God, at his disposal, and bounded by him, and therefore his will should
be submitted to; which is the doctrine the Lord would teach Job by all
this.

[Job 38:21](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 38:21</span></span>

Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born?.... When light and
darkness were first separated, and had their several apartments assigned
them; their laws and rules given them, and their bounds and limits set
them? No; he was not: and, had he been the first man, could not have
been early enough to have been present at the doing of this, and so come
at the knowledge thereof; since man was not made until the sixth day of
the creation;

or because the number of thy days is great; reach to the beginning of
time, and so as old as the creation. This was not the case. Some
understand these words ironically; "thou knowest" the places and bounds
of light and darkness, since thou art a very old man, born as soon as
the world was. Whereas he was of yesterday, and knew nothing; which to
convince him of is the design of this biting, cutting, expression. The
Targum is,

"didst thou know then that thou shouldest be born, and the number of thy
days many?''

No, Job did not know when he was born, nor of whom, and in what
circumstances, but by the relation of others; and much less could he
know before he was born, that he should be, or how long he should live
in the world: but God knows all this beforehand; when men shall come
into the world, at what period and of what parents, and how long they
shall continue in it.

[Job 38:22](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 38:22</span></span>

Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the
treasures of the hail? The vapours raised, and clouds formed in the
atmosphere, which is the storehouse of those meteors; and may be called
treasures, because hidden in the clouds, and not seen by man until the
fall of them; and because they are in the keeping, and at the command
and direction of the Lord the proprietor of them; and because rich and
enriching, especially snow, which falling keeps the earth warm, and
makes it fruitful; and because of the abundance thereof which sometimes
falls. Now we are not to imagine that the Lord has stores of these laid
up in heaps, in times past for time to come; but that he can and does as
easily and as soon produce them when he pleases, as one that has
treasures laid up can bring them forth at once.

[Job 38:23](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 38:23</span></span>

Which I have reserved against the time of trouble,.... For the
punishment or affliction of men; and is explained as follows,

against the day of battle and war? as his artillery and ammunition to
light his enemies with. Of hail we have instances in Scripture, as
employed against the Egyptians and Canaanites, [Exo
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#025.md); and of a reserve of it in the
purposes of God, and in prophecy against the day of battle with
antichrist, [Rev 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#021.md); and so Jarchi
interprets it here of the war of Gog and Magog. And though there are no
instances of snow being used in this way in Scripture, yet there is in
history. Strabo (s) reports, that at Corzena and Cambysena, which join
to Mount Caucasus, such snows have fallen, that whole companies of men
have been swallowed up in them; and even armies have been overwhelmed
with them, as the army of the Gauls (t); and such quantities have been
thrown down from mountains, on which they have been lodged, that towns,
towers, and villages, have been laid prostrate by them (u); and in the
year 443, a vast snow destroyed many (w). Frequently do we hear in our
parts of the disasters occasioned by them. The Targum particularly makes
mention of snow; and renders it, "which snow I have reserved", &c.
though absurdly applies it to punishment in hell.

By what way is the light parted,.... That is, dost thou know by what way
it is parted or divided? as at the first creation, when God divided the
light from darkness, [Gen 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#004.md); or at
sun rising and sun setting; and so in the two hemispheres, when there is
darkness on the one, and light on the other; or under the two poles,
when there are interchangeably six months light and six months darkness.
Or how it is parted in an unequal distribution of day and night, at
different seasons and in different climates; or how on one and the same
day, and at the same time, the sun shall shine in one part of the earth,
and not another; and more especially if this had been now a fact, and
known, that there should be darkness all over the land of Egypt, and
light in Goshen. Some understand this of lightning, but that is later
mentioned;

which scattereth the east wind upon the earth? that rising sometimes
with the sun, or first spring of light; see [Jon
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#008.md); or which light spreads and
diffuses itself "from the east", as it may be rendered. The sun rises in
the east, and in a very quick and surprising manner spreads and diffuses
its light throughout the hemisphere. Or this may respect the east wind
itself, which scatters the clouds; and either spreads them in the
heavens over the earth, or disperses them and drives away rain (x), as
the north wind does: or as Mr. Broughton renders the words, "and the
east wind scattereth itself over the earth"; it blowing invisibly and
without our knowledge, goes and returns as other winds do, [Joh
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#008.md).

Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters,.... For a
very large shower of rain, as the Vulgate Latin version: for this is not
to be understood of an aqueduct, channel, or canal made on earth, either
for the draining of waters off of land overflowed thereby, or for the
conveyance of it to different parts to overflow it; such as were cut out
of the Nile in Egypt, for the overflowing of the land, to make it
fruitful; such may be and have been made by men: but of a watercourse in
the air or atmosphere, as a canal or channel, for the rain to come down
upon the earth; and this is the work of God, and him only, who directs
and steers the course of rain, that it falls regularly and gently, not
in spouts and floods, but in drops larger or lesser, on what spot of
ground, or part of the earth, he pleases: and if what Jarchi says true,
that every drop has its course, its canal, through which it passes, it
is still more wonderful;

or a way for the lightning of thunder: which generally go together, and
are of God. His fire and voice, and for which he makes a way, by which
they burst and break forth out of the cloud, and their course is
directed by him under the whole heavens; see [Job
28:26](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#026.md). So the Gospel, compared to rain
and lightning, has its direction and its course steered to what part of
the world, he pleases; see [Psa 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#004.md).

To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the wilderness,
wherein there is no man. Which is uninhabited by men, being so dry and
barren; where there is no man to cultivate and water it, as gardens are;
and where is no man to receive any advantage by the rain that comes upon
it; and yet the Lord sends it for the use of animals that dwell there;
which shows his care and providence with respect even to the wild beasts
of the earth. This may be an emblem of the rain of the Gospel upon the
Gentile world, comparable to a wilderness; see [Isa

To satisfy the desolate and waste ground,.... Which is exceeding
desolate, and therefore two such words are used to express it; which is
so dry and thirsty that it is one of the four things that say not it is
enough, [Pro 30:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#016.md); and yet God can
and does give it rain to its full satisfaction, [Psa
104:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#013.md); so the Lord satisfies souls,
comparable to dry and thirsty ground, by his word and ordinances, with
the goodness and fatness of his house; see [Psa
63:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#001.md);

and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth? grass for the
cattle, and herb for the service of men, [Psa

spiritual sense for the budding and increase of the graces of the Spirit

Hath the rain a father?.... None but God; hence the Heathens themselves
call God (y), and (z); see [Jer 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#022.md);
he that is our Father in heaven is the Father of rain, and him only;
whatever secondary causes there be, God only is the efficient cause,
parent, and producer of it: so the Gospel is not of men but of God, is a
gift of his, comes down from heaven, tarries not for men, and is a great
blessing, as rain is;

or who hath begotten the drops of the dew? which are innumerable; he
that is the parent of the rain is of the dew also, and he only (a); to
which sometimes not only the word of God, and his free favour and good
will, but the people of God themselves are compared for their number,
influence, and use; see [Psa 110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003.md);
and their new birth is similar to the generation of dew, it being not of
the will of man, but of God, according to his abundant mercy, free
favour, and good will, is from above, from heaven, and is effected
silently, secretly, suddenly, at an unawares; [Joh

frost become as hard as a stone, and will bear great burdens, and admit

waters under them are hid and quite out of sight: an emblem of the hard
heart of man, which can only be thawed by the power and grace of God, by
the south wind of the Spirit blowing, and the "sun of righteousness"
rising on it;

and the face of the deep is frozen; or bound together by the frost, as
the Targum; it is taken, laid hold on, and kept together, as the word
signifies, so that it cannot flow. Historians speak of seas being frozen
up, as some parts of the Scythian sea, reported by Mela (d), and the
Cimmerian Bosphorus, by Herodotus (e), and the northern seas by Olaus
Magnus (f); as that men might travel over them on foot or on horseback,
from one country to another; and Strabo relates (g), that where a sea
fight has been in the summer time, armies and hosts have met and fought
in the winter. In Muscovy the ice is to six and ten feet deep (h); in
the year 401 the Euxine sea (i) was frozen over for the space of twenty
days; and in the year 763 the seas at Constantinople were frozen one
hundred miles from the shore, so thick as to bear the heaviest carriages
(k).

Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades,.... Of which See Gill
on [Job 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#009.md); and this constellation of
the seven stars which is meant, rising in the spring, the pleasantnesses
of the season, as the word may be rendered, may be intended here; which
cannot be restrained or hindered from taking place in the proper course
of the year; which is beautifully described in [Sol
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#012.md); and may in a spiritual sense
relate to the effects of powerful and efficacious grace, the influences
of which are irresistible, and cause a springtime in the souls of men,
where it was before winter, a state of darkness, deadness, coldness,
hardness, and unfruitfulness, but now the reverse. Some versions read,
"the bands of the Pleiades" (l), as if the sense was, canst thou gather
and bind, or cluster together, such a constellation as the seven stars
be, as I have done? thou canst not; and so not stop their rising or
hinder their influences, according to the other versions:

or loose the bands of Orion? of which See Gill on [Job
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#009.md) and [Amo
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#008.md). This constellation appears in the
winter, and brings with it stormy winds, rain, snow, and frost, which
latter binds up the earth, that seeds and roots in it cannot spring up;
and binds the hands of men from working, by benumbing them, or rendering
their materials or utensils useless; for which reasons bands are
ascribed to Orion, and are such strong ones that it is not in the power
of men to loose: the seasons are not to be altered by men; and, Job
might be taught by this that it was not in his power to make any change
in the dispensations of Providence; to turn the winter of adversity into
the spring of prosperity; and therefore it was best silently to submit
to the sovereignty of God, and wait his time for a change of
circumstances.

stars, signified by chambers, because hidden from our sight in this part

sailed, but is not to be guided by men; this, constellation is fancied
to be in the form of a wain or wagon, and is called Charles's wain;

respecting their situation, motion, operation, influence, and use, which

unto them, as to influence the bodies of men, especially the tempers and
dispositions of their minds; to affect their wills and moral actions,
the events and occurrences of their lives, and the fate of nations and

good men, when provoked, would make use of such a power to destroy the

Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts?.... That is, of man, in his
heart, as explained in the next clause; such wisdom as to guide the
stars, know the ordinances of heaven, set their dominion on earth,
manage and direct the clouds and lightning; no such wisdom is put in
man:

or who hath, given understanding to the heart? to understand all the
above things, and answer to the several questions put in this chapter;
though, as these clauses may respect much one and the same thing, they
may be understood of wisdom and understanding in man, whether natural or
spiritual; and seeing they are found there, the question is, who put
them there, or how came they there? who gave them to him? the answer
must be, God himself, and no other; man has his rational soul, his
intellectual powers, the light of nature and reason in him; all his
understanding in arts and sciences, trades and manufactures, is of the
Lord, and not of himself or another, see [Job
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#008.md); all spiritual wisdom and
understanding which lies in a man's concern for his eternal welfare in
the knowledge of himself, and of his state and condition by nature, and
of the way of life and salvation by Christ, and of the truths and
doctrines of the Gospel, is all of God and Christ, and by the spirit of
wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him; no man, therefore, has
any reason to glory in his wisdom and knowledge, of whatsoever kind, as
though he had not received it; nor should he dare to arraign the wisdom
of God in his providential dealings with men; since he that teaches man
knowledge must needs know better than man how to govern the world he has
made, and dispose of all things in it. The last clause is in the Vulgate
Latin rendered, "who hath given to the cock understanding?" and so the
Targums and other Jewish writers (p) interpret it; and they observe (q),
that in Arabia a cock is called by the word that is here used; and in
their morning prayers, and at hearing a cock crow (r),

"Blessed be the Lord, who giveth to the cock understanding to
distinguish between the day and the night:''

but however remarkable the understanding of this creature is, which God
has given it, and which is even taken notice of by Heathen writers (s);
that it should know the stars, distinguish the hours of the night by
crowing, and express its joy at the rising of the sun and moon; yet such
a sense of the text seems impertinent, as well as that of the Septuagint
version, of giving to women the wisdom and knowledge of weaving and
embroidery.

Who can number the clouds in wisdom?.... Or has such wisdom as to be
able to count them when the heavens are full of them; hence they are
used to denote a great multitude, [Isa
55:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#008); or "declare" them (t.md), set forth
and explain the nature of them, their matter, motion, and use; none can
do this perfectly or completely. Aben Ezra interprets it, who can make
them as sapphire? in which he is followed by Mr. Broughton and others
(u); the sapphire is a precious stone, very clear and lucid, of a sky
colour. And then the sense is, who can make a clear and serene sky, when
it is cloudy? None but the Lord; see [Job
37:11](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#011.md);

or who can stay the bottles of heaven? or "barrels", as Mr. Broughton;
the clouds in which the rain is bottled or barrelled up; and when it is
the pleasure of God to pour them out, who can stay, stop, or restrain
them? or who can "cause them to lie down" (w)? that is, on the earth; to
descend or "distil" on it, as the same translator. Who can do this, when
it is the will of God to withhold them? To stop or unstop, those
bottles, to restrain rain, or pour it forth, is entirely at his dispose,
and not man's; see [Job 38:34](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#034.md).

When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together?
When the dust is attenuated, and ground, as it were, into powder; and
the clods cleave together, as if glued, as in a drought for want of
rain: or the bottles of heaven being unstopped and poured out; or

"sprinkling the dust with this sprinkling,''

as Mr. Broughton. Or rather, pouring on the dust with pouring; that is,
pouring down rain, by unstopping the bottles of heaven. The dust, as
meal, by water poured into it, cements, unites, and is compacted, and
becomes earth, that may be cultivated; is clodded and cleaves together,
and may be ploughed and sown.

Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion?.... From meteors the Lord passes
to animals, beasts, and birds, wherefore some here begin the thirty
ninth chapter, which only treats of such; and he begins with the lion,
the strongest among beasts, and most fierce; cruel, and voracious; and
asks, who hunts his prey for him? Not man, who cannot; and if he could,
durst not: but the Lord does; and, according to some writers (x), he has
provided a small creature, between a fox and a wolf, called a jackal;
which goes before the lion, and hunts the prey for him. And could this
be understood particularly of the old lion, as Cocceius and others,
naturalists (y) observe, that young lions hunt for the old ones, when
they are not able to go in search of prey; and when they have got it,
either bring it to them, or call them to partake of it with them;

or fill the appetite of the young lions, whose appetite is sharp and
keen, and requires a great deal to fill it, and especially to satisfy a
great many of them; herds of them, as Mr. Broughton renders the word,
and which signifies a company; see [Psa
68:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#030.md). Men cannot feed them, but God
can and does; there being some ends in Providence to be answered
thereby, see [Psa 104:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#021.md); see also
[Psa 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#008.md).

When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait?
Which some understand of old lions, who, for want of strength, lie
couchant in their dens, or in some covert place, waiting for any prey
that passes by, to seize upon it. But the same pasture and places are
used by younger lions, as well as old ones; who are emblems of wicked
men, cruel persecutors, and bloodthirsty tyrants, who fill their palaces
and kingdoms with murder and rapine; see [Psa
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#008.md), [Nah
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#011.md).

Who provideth for the raven his food?.... Not man, but God; he feeds the
ravens, creatures very voracious, mean, and useless, [Luk
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#024.md);

when his young ones cry unto God; cry for want of food; which is
interpreted by the Lord as a cry unto him, and he relieves them, [Psa
147:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#009.md); when deserted by the old ones;
either left in their nests through forgetfulness, as some (z); or
because they are not, till fledged, black like them, as others (a); when
God feeds them, as some say (b), with a kind of dew from heaven, or with
flies that fly about them, and fall into their mouths; or with worms
bred out of their dung but these things are not to be depended on; it
may rather respect them when cast out of the nest by the old ones, when
able to fly, which is testified by naturalists (c); and with this agrees
what follows:

they wander for lack of meat; being obliged to shift for themselves,
when God takes care of them; which is an instance of his providential
goodness; and how this is to be improved, see [Mat
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#026.md).
