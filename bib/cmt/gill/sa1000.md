INTRODUCTION TO 1 SAMUEL

This book, in the Hebrew copies, is commonly called Samuel, or the Book
of Samuel; in the Syriac version, the Book of Samuel the Prophet; and in
the Arabic version, the Book of Samuel the Prophet, which is the First
Book of the Kings; and the Septuagint version, the Book of the Kingdom:
it has the name of Samuel, because it contains an history of his life
and times; and the Jews say (a) it was written by him; and as it may
well enough be thought to be, to the end of the twenty fourth chapter;
and the rest might be written by Nathan and Gad, as may he gathered from
[Ch1 29:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#029) as also the following book
that bears his name; and both may be called the Books of Kings, because
they give an account of the rise of the kings in Israel, and of the two
first of them; though some think they were written by Jeremiah, as
Abarbinel; and others ascribe them to Ezra: however, there is no doubt
to be made of it that this book was written by divine inspiration, when
we consider the series of its history, its connection and harmony with
other parts of Scripture; the several things borrowed from it, or
alluded to in the book of Psalms, particularly what is observed in [Psa
113:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#007), seems to be taken out of [Sa1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#008), and the sanction which the Lord
gives to it, by referring to a fact in it, whereby he stopped the mouths
of the Scribes and Pharisees cavilling at his disciples, [Mat
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#003), compared with [Sa1
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#003), yea, even, as Huetius (b)
observes, some Heathen writers have by their testimonies confirmed some
passages in these books, which they seem to have been acquainted with,
as Nicolaus of Damascus (c), and Eupolemus (d); it contains an history
of the government of Eli, and of the birth of Samuel, and his education
under him; of the succession of Samuel in it, and the resignation of it
to Saul, when he was chosen king; of his administration of his office,
and of things done in the time of it, both before and after his
rejection, and of the persecution of David by Saul, and is concluded
with his death.
