[Ecclesiastes](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001.md)

INTRODUCTION TO ECCLESIASTES 2

Solomon, having made trial of natural wisdom and knowledge in its utmost
extent, and found it to be vanity, proceeds to the experiment of
pleasure, and tries whether any happiness was in that, [Ecc
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#001.md). As for that which at first sight
was vain, frothy, and frolicsome, he dispatches at once, and condemns it
as mad and unprofitable, [Ecc 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#002.md); but
as for those pleasures which were more manly, rational, and lawful, he
dwells upon them, and gives a particular enumeration of them, as what he
had made full trial of; as good eating and drinking, in a moderate way,
without abuse; fine and spacious buildings; delightful vineyards,
gardens, and orchards; parks, forests, and enclosures; fish pools, and
fountains of water; a large retinue, and equipage of servants; great
possessions, immense riches and treasure; a collection of the greatest
rarities, and curiosities in nature; all kinds of music, vocal and
instrumental, [Ecc 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#003.md); in all which
he exceeded any that went before him; nor did he deny himself of any
pleasure, in a lawful way, that could possibly be enjoyed, [Ecc
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#009.md). And yet on a survey of the whole,
and after a thorough experience of what could be found herein, he
pronounces all vanity and vexation of spirit, [Ecc
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#011.md); and returns again to his former
subject, wisdom; and looks that over again, to see if he could find real
happiness in it, being sadly disappointed in that of pleasure, [Ecc
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#012.md). He indeed commends wisdom, and
prefers it to folly, and a wise man to a fool; [Ecc
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#013.md); and yet observes some things
which lessen its value; and shows there is no happiness in it, the same
events befalling a wise man and a fool; both alike forgotten, and die in
like manner, [Ecc 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#015.md). And then he
takes into consideration business of life, and a laborious industry to
obtain wealth; and this he condemns as grievous, hateful, and vexatious,
because, after all a man's acquisitions, he knows not to whom he shall
leave them, whether to a wise man or a fool, [Ecc
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#017.md). And because a man himself has no
rest all his days, nothing but sorrow and grief, [Ecc
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#022.md); wherefore he concludes it is
best for a man to enjoy the good things of this life himself; which he
confirms by his own experience, and by an, antithesis between a good man
and a wicked one, [Ecc 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#024.md).

[Ecclesiastes 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 2:1</span></span>

I said in mine heart,.... He communed with his heart, he thought and
reasoned within himself, and came to this resolution in his own mind;
that since he could not find happiness in natural wisdom and knowledge,
he would seek for it elsewhere, even in pleasure; in which, he observed,
some men placed their happiness; or, however, sought for it there: or,
"I said to my heart", as the Syriac version;

Go to now; or, "go, I pray thee" (u) listen to what I am about to say,
and pursue the track I shall now point out to thee;

I will prove thee with mirth; with those things which will cause mirth,
joy, and pleasure; and try whether any happiness can be enjoyed this
way, since it could not be had in wisdom and knowledge. Jarchi and Aben
Ezra render it, "I will mingle", wine with water, or with spices; or, "I
will pour out", wine in plenty to drink of, "with joy", and to promote
mirth: but the Targum, Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic versions,
interpret it as we do, and which sense Aben Ezra makes mention of;

therefore enjoy pleasure; which man is naturally a lover of; he was so
in his state of innocency, and this was the bait that was laid for him,
and by which he was drawn into sin; and now he loves, lives in, and
serves sinful pleasures; which are rather imaginary than real, and last
but for a season, and end in bitterness: but such sordid lusts and
pleasures are not here meant; Solomon was too wise and good a man to
give into these, as the "summum bonum"; or ever to think there could be
any happiness in them, or even to make a trial of them for that purpose:
not criminal pleasures, or an impure, sottish, and epicurean life, are
here intended; but manly, rational, and lawful pleasures, for no other
are mentioned in the detail of particulars following; and, in the
pursuit of the whole, he was guided and governed by his wisdom, and that
remained in him, [Ecc 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#003.md). It may be
rendered, "therefore see good" (w); look upon all the good, pleasant,
and delectable things of life; and enjoy them in such a manner as, if
possible, happiness may be attained in them;

and, behold, this also is vanity; it will be found, by making the
experiment, that there is no solid and substantial happiness in it, as
it was by himself.

[Ecclesiastes 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 2:2</span></span>

I said of laughter, it is mad,.... The risible faculty in man is given
him for some usefulness; and when used in a moderate way, and kept
within due bounds, is of service to him, and conduces to the health of
his body, and the pleasure of his mind; but when used on every trivial
occasion, and at every foolish thing that is said or done, and indulged
to excess, it is mere madness, and makes a man look more like a madman
and a fool than a wise man; it lasts but for a while, and the end of it
is heaviness, [Ecc 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#006.md). Or, "I said to
laughter, thou art mad" (x); and therefore will have nothing to do with
thee in the excessive and criminal way, but shun thee, as one would do a
mad man: this therefore is not to be reckoned into the pleasure he bid
his soul go to and enjoy;

and of mirth, what doth it? what good does do? of what profit and
advantage is it to man? If the question is concerning innocent mirth,
the answer may be given out of [Pro
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#013.md); but if of carnal sinful mirth,
there is no good arises from that to the body or mind; or any kind of
happiness to be enjoyed that way, and therefore no trial is to be made
of it. What the wise man proposed to make trial of, and did, follows in
the next verses.

[Ecclesiastes 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 2:3</span></span>

I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine,.... Not in an
immoderate way, so as to intoxicate himself with it, in which there can
be no pleasure, nor any show of happiness; but in a moderate, yet
liberal way, so as to be innocently cheerful and pleasant, and hereby
try what good and happiness were to be possessed in this way. By "wine"
is meant, not that only, but everything eatable and drinkable that is
good; it signifies what is called good living, good eating and drinking:
Solomon always lived well; was brought up as a prince, and, when he came
to the throne, lived like a king; but being increased in riches, and
willing to make trial of the good that was in all the creatures of God,
to see if any happiness was in them; determines to keep a better table
still, and resolved to have everything to eat or drink that could be
had, cost what it will; of Solomon's daily provision for his household,
see [Kg1 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#022.md); the Midrash interprets
it, of the wine of the law. It may be rendered, "I sought in mine heart
to draw out my flesh with wine", or "my body" (y); to extend it, and
make it fat and plump; which might be reduced to skin and bones, to a
mere skeleton, through severe studies after wisdom and knowledge. The
Targum is,

"I sought in my heart to draw my flesh into the house of the feast of
wine;''

as if there was a reluctance in him to such a conduct; and that he as it
were put a force upon himself, in order to make the experiment;

(yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom); or, "yet my heart led me in
wisdom" (z): he was guided and governed by wisdom in this research of
happiness; he was upon his guard, that he did not go into any sinful
extravagancies, or criminal excesses in eating and drinking;

and to lay hold on folly; that he might better know what folly was, and
what was the folly of the sons of men to place their happiness in such
things; or rather, he studiously sought to lay hold on folly, to
restrain it, and himself from it, that it might not have the ascendant
over him; so that he would not be able to form a right judgment whether
there is any real happiness in this sort of pleasure, or not, he is,
speaking of; for the epicure, the voluptuous person, is no judge of it;

till I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which they
should do under the heaven all the days of their life; where the "summum
bonum", or chief happiness of man lies; and which he should endeavour to
seek after and pursue, that he might enjoy it throughout the whole of
his life, while in this world: and that he might still more fully know
it, if possible, he did the following things.

\(y\) "ut diducerem vino carnem meam", Piscator; "ut protraherem, et
inde distenderem carnem meam", Rambachius. (z) "et cor meam ducens in
sapientia", Montanus; "interim cor meum ducens in sapientiam", Drusius.

[Ecclesiastes 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 2:4</span></span>

I made me great works,.... He did not spend his time in trifling things,
as Domitian (a), in catching and killing flies; but in devising,
designing, directing, and superintending great works of art and skill,
becoming the grandeur of his state, and the greatness of his mind: the
Midrash restrains it to his great throne of ivory, overlaid with gold,
[Kg1 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#018.md), but it is a general
expression, including all the great things he did, of which the
following is a particular enumeration;

I builded me houses; among which must not be reckoned the house of God,
though that was built by him, and in the first place; yet this was
built, not for his own pleasure and grandeur, but for the worship and
glory of God: but his own house and palace is chiefly meant, which was
thirteen years in building; and the house of the forest in Lebanon,
which perhaps was his country seat; with all other houses and offices,
for his stores, for his servants, his horsemen, and chariots; see [Kg1
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#001.md); and in fine spacious buildings
men take a great deal of pleasure, and promise themselves much happiness
in dwelling in them, and in perpetuating their names to posterity by
them; see [Psa 49:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#011.md). The Targum is,

"I multiplied good works in Jerusalem; I builded me houses; the house of
the sanctuary, to make atonement for Israel; the king's house of
refreshment, and the conclave and porch; and the house of judgment, of
hewn stones, where the wise men sit and do judgment; I made a throne of
ivory for the royal seat;''

I planted me vineyards; perhaps those at Engedi were of his planting;
however, he had one at Baalhamon, and no doubt in other places, [Sol
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#014.md); the Targum makes mention of one
at Jabne, planted by him; these also add to the pleasure of human life;
it is delightful to walk in them, to gather the fruit and drink of the
wine of them; see [Sol 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#012.md).

[Ecclesiastes 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 2:5</span></span>

I made me gardens and orchards,.... Of the king's garden, we read [Jer
39:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#004). Adrichomius (b.md) makes mention of
a royal garden in the suburbs of Jerusalem, fenced with walls; and was a
paradise of fruit trees, herbs, spices, and flowers; abounded with all
kind of fruit, exceeding pleasant and delightful to the senses: and, as
Solomon was so great a botanist, and knew the nature and use of all
kinds of trees and herbs, [Kg1 4:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#033.md);
no doubt but he has a herbal garden, well stocked with everything of
that kind, curious and useful; see [Kg1
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#002.md). Gardens are made for pleasure as
well as profit; Adam, as soon as created, was put into a garden, to add
to his natural pleasure and felicity, as well as for his employment,
[Gen 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#008.md); and the pleasure of walking
in a garden, and partaking of the fruits of it, are alluded to by
Solomon, [Sol 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#012.md);

and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits; which, as before
observed, he had thorough knowledge of, and many of which were brought
him from foreign parts; and all served to make his gardens, orchards,
parks, forests, and enclosures, very pleasant and delectable. The Targum
adds,

"some for food, others for drink, and others for medicine.''

[Ecclesiastes 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 2:6</span></span>

I made me pools of water,.... For cascades and water works to play in,
as well as to keep and produce fish of all kinds: mention is made of the
king's pools, [Neh 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#014.md); the fish
pools at Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim, perhaps belonged to
Solomon, [Sol 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#004.md); Little more than a
league from Bethlehem are pools of water, which at this day are called
the fish pools of Solomon; they are great reservatories cut in the rock,
the one at the end of the other; the second being a little lower than
the first, and the third than the second, and so communicate the water
from one to another when they are full (c); and of which Mr. Maundrell
(d) gives the following account:

"They are about an hour and a quarter distant from Bethlehem, southward;
they are three in number, lying in a row above each other, being so
disposed, that the waters of the uppermost may descend into the second,
and those of the second into the third; their figure is quadrangular;
the breadth is the same in all, amounting to above ninety paces; in
their length there is some difference between them, the first being
about an hundred sixty paces long; the second, two hundred; the third,
two hundred twenty; they are all lined with a wall, and plastered, and
contain a great depth of water.''

And to these, he observes, together with the gardens adjoining, Solomon
is supposed to allude, [Ecc 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#005.md). There
are to be seen, he says (e), some remains of an old aqueduct, which
anciently conveyed the waters from Solomon's pools to Jerusalem; this is
said to be the genuine work of Solomon, and may well be allowed to be in
reality what it is pretended for. So Rauwolff (f) says,

"beyond the tower of Ader, in another valley, not far from Bethlehem,
they show still to this day a large orchard, full of citron, lemon,
orange, pomegranate, and fig trees, and many others, which King Solomon
did plant in his days; with ponds, canals, and other water works, very
pleasantly prepared, as he saith himself, [Ecc
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#005.md); this is still in our time full of
good and fruitful trees, worthy to be seen for their sakes, and ditches
there: wherefore I really believe it to be the same Josephus (g) makes
mention of, called Ethan, about twelve mile from Jerusalem; where
Solomon had pleasant gardens and water pools, to which he used to ride
early in a morning.''

Mr. Maundrell (h) also makes mention of some cisterns, called Solomon's
cisterns, at Roselayn, about an hour from the ruins of Tyre; of which
there are three entire at this day; one about three hundred yards
distant from the sea, the other two a little further up; and, according
to tradition, they were made by that great king, in recompence to King
Hiram, for supplying materials towards building the temple: but, as he
observes, these, though ancient, could not be built before the time of
Alexander; since the aqueduct, which conveys the water from hence to
Tyre, is carried over the neck of land, by which he joined the city to
the continent. Jarchi interprets these pools in this text of places to
keep fish alive in, and so the Midrash understands by them fish pools;
though they seem to be canals made in the gardens, orchards, and parks;

to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees; the young
nurseries, which in time grew up to large fruit bearing trees; which,
being numerous and thick, looked like a wood or forest, as the word is;
and which canals and nurseries both added greatly to the delight and
pleasure of those places. In this manner the Indians water their
gardens; who commonly have in them a great pit, or kind of fish pool,
which is full of rain water; and just by it there is a basin of brick,
raised about two feet higher than the ground: when therefore they have a
mind to water the garden, it is filled with water from the fish pool, or
pit; which, through a hole that is at the bottom, falls into a canal,
that is divided into many branches, proportionable in size to their
distance from the basin, and carries the water to the foot of each tree,
and to each plot of herbs; and when the gardeners think they are watered
enough, they stop up, or turn aside, the canals with clods of earth (i).
The beauty of a plant, or tree, is thus described by Aelianus (k);

"branches generous, leaves thick, stem or trunk firm and stable, roots
deep; winds shaking it; a large shadow cast from it; changing with the
seasons of the year; and water, partly brought through canals, and
partly coming from heaven, to water and nourish it; and such beautiful,
well watered, and flourishing trees, contribute much to the pleasure of
gardens.''

[Ecclesiastes 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 2:7</span></span>

I got me servants and maidens,.... Menservants, and maidservants; the
Targum adds,

"of the children of Ham, and of the rest of the strange people;''

these were such as he hired, or bought with his money;

and had servants born in my house; and these were all employed by him;
either as his retinue and equipage, his attendants and bodyguards; or to
take care of his household, his gardens, and pools; or for his horses
and chariots, and for various offices; see [Kg1
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#026.md), [Ezr
2:58](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#058.md). Villalpandus computes the number
of his servants to be forty eight thousand; if there were any pleasure
and happiness in such a numerous attendance, Solomon had it;

also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that
were in Jerusalem before me; oxen, cows, horses, asses, camels, mules,
&c. also sheep and goats; which, as they were profitable, so it was
pleasant to see them grazing on the hills and valleys, in the fields,
mountains, and meadows.

[Ecclesiastes 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 2:8</span></span>

I gathered me also silver and gold,.... In great quantities: the weight
of gold which came to him in one year was six hundred threescore and six
talents; see [Kg1 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#014.md);

and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces; whatsoever was
valuable and precious, such as is laid up in the cabinets of kings, as
jewels and precious stones; and everything rare and curious, to be found
in all provinces of the earth, or which were brought from thence as
presents to him; the Targum is,

"and the treasures of kings and provinces, given to me for tribute:''

wherefore, if any pleasure arises from these things, as do to the
virtuosi, Solomon enjoyed it. Moreover, among the treasures of kings
were precious garments of various sorts, as were in the treasury of
Ahasuerus (l); and when Alexander took Shushan, he found in the king's
treasures, of Hermionic purple, to the value of five thousand talents,
which had been laid up there almost two hundred years (m); and to such
treasure Christ alludes, [Mat 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#019.md);

I got me men singers and women singers; the harmony and music of whose
voices greatly delight; see [Sa2
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#035.md); the Targum interprets it both
of instruments of music for the Levites to use in the temple, and of
singing men and women at a feast: and such persons were employed among
other nations (n), on such occasions, to entertain their guests; and are
called the ornaments of feasts (o); as were also "choraules", or pipers
(p);

and the delights of the sons of men; as musical instruments, and that of
all sorts; such as David his father invented; and to which he might add
more, and indeed got all that were to be obtained; see [Amo
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#005.md). The two last words, rendered
"musical instruments, of all sorts", are differently interpreted; the
Targum interprets them of hot waters and baths, having pipes to let out
hot water and cold; Aben Ezra, of women taken captive; Jarchi, of
chariots and covered wagons; the Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic
versions, of cup bearers, men, and women, that pour out wine and serve
it; and the Vulgate Latin version, of cups and pots, to pour out wine.
It seems best to understand it of musical instruments, or of musical
compositions (q); sung either with a single voice, or in concert; which,
according to Bochart (r), were called "sidoth", from Sido, a Phoenician
woman of great note, the inventor of them or rather from giving unequal
sounds, which, by their grateful mixture and temperament, broke and
destroyed (s) one another.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 2:9</span></span>

So I was great,.... Became famous for the great works wrought by him
before mentioned;

and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem; the Targum
adds, "in riches"; but it seems rather to respect his fame and glory
among men; though in general it may include his increase of wealth,
power, and honour, and everything that contributed to his external
happiness;

also my wisdom remained with me; the Targum adds, "and it helped me";
which he exercised and showed in the government of his kingdom, in the
conduct of his family, in his personal deportment and behaviour; amidst
all his pleasures, he did not neglect the study of natural knowledge,
nor give himself up to sordid and sinful lusts; and so was a better
judge of pleasure, whether true happiness consisted in it or not.

[Ecclesiastes 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 2:10</span></span>

And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them,.... Though this
sense is only mentioned, all are designed; he denied himself of nothing
that was agreeable to him, that was pleasing to the eye, to the ear, to
the taste, or any other sense; he indulged himself in everything,
observing a proper decorum, and keeping himself within the due bounds of
sobriety and good sense;

I withheld not my heart from any joy: the Targum says, "from all joy of
the law"; but it is to be understood of natural pleasure, and of the
gratifications of the senses in a wise and moderate manner;

for my heart rejoiced in all my labours; he took all the pleasure that
could be taken in the works he wrought for that purpose before
enumerated;

and this was my portion of all my labour; pleasure was what he aimed at,
and that he enjoyed; this was the fruit and issue of all his laborious
works; the part allotted him, the inheritance he possessed, and the
thing he sought after.

[Ecclesiastes 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 2:11</span></span>

Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the
labour that I had laboured to do,.... He had looked at them, and on
them, over and over again, and had taken pleasure therein; but now he
sits down and enters into a serious consideration of them, what
prodigious expenses he had been at; what care and thought, what toil and
labour of mind, he had taken in contriving, designing, and bringing
these works to perfection; what pleasure and delight he had found in
them, and what happiness upon the whole arose from them: he now passes
his judgment, and gives his sentiments concerning these things, having
had it in his power to make himself master of everything delightful,
which he did; was a competent judge, and thoroughly qualified to give a
just estimate of matters; and it is as follows;

and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit; nothing solid and
substantial in the whole; no true pleasure and real joy, and no
satisfaction or happiness in that pleasure; these pleasing things
perished with the using, and the pleasure of them faded and died in the
enjoyment of them; and instead of yielding solid delight, only proved
vexations, because the pleasure was so soon over, and left a thirst for
more, and what was not to be had; at most and best, only the outward
senses were fed, the mind not at all improved, nor the heart made
better, and much less contented; it was only pleasing the fancy and
imagination, and feeding on wind;

and there was no profit under the sun; by those things; to improve and
satisfy the mind of man, to raise him to true happiness, to be of any
service to him in the hour of death, or fit him for an eternal world.
Alshech interprets the labour mentioned in this text of the labour of
the law, which brings no reward to a man in this world.

[Ecclesiastes 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 2:12</span></span>

And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly,.... Being
disappointed in his pursuit of pleasure, and not finding satisfaction
and happiness in that, he turns from it, and reassumes his study of
natural wisdom and knowledge, to make a fresh trial, and see whether
there might be some things he had overlooked in his former inquiries;
and whether upon a revise of what he had looked into he might not find
more satisfaction than before; being convinced however that the pursuit
of pleasure was less satisfying than the study of wisdom, and therefore
relinquished the one for the sake of the other: and in order, if
possible, to gain more satisfaction in this point, he determined to look
more narrowly, and penetrate into the secrets of wisdom, and find out
the nature of it, and examine its contraries; that by setting them in a
contrast, and comparing them together, he might be the better able to
form a judgment of them. Jarchi interprets "wisdom" of the law, and
"madness" and "folly" of the punishment of transgression. Alshech also
by "wisdom" understands the wisdom of the law, and by madness external
wisdom, or the knowledge of outward things. But Aben Ezra understands by
"madness" wine, with which men being intoxicated become mad; and by
"folly" building houses, and getting riches;

for what can the man do that cometh after the king? meaning himself;
what can a man do that comes after such a king as he was, who had such
natural parts to search into and acquire all sorts of knowledge; who was
possessed of such immense riches, that he could procure everything that
was necessary to assist him in his pursuit of knowledge; and who wanted
not industry, diligence, and application, and who succeeded above any
before or after him? wherefore what can any common man do, or anyone
that comes after such a person, and succeeds him in his studies, and
treads in his steps, and follows his example and plan, what can he do
more than is done already? or can he expect to outdo such a prince, or
find out that which he could not? nay, it is as if he should say, it is
not only a vain thing for another man to come after me in the search of
knowledge, in hopes of finding more than I have done; but it is a
fruitless attempt in me to take up this affair again; for, after all
that I have done, what can I do more? so that these words are not a
reason for his pursuit of wisdom, but a correction of himself for it; I
think the words may be rendered, "but what can that man do that comes
after the king?" so the particle is sometimes used (t); meaning himself,
or his successor, or any other person; since it was only going over the
same thing again, running round the circle of knowledge again, without
any new improvement, or fresh satisfaction, according to the following
answer;

even that which hath been already done; it is only doing the same thing
over again. The Targum and Jarchi interpret it of the vain attempt of a
man to supplicate a king after a decree is passed and executed. The
Midrash by the king understands God himself, and interprets it of the
folly of men not being content with their condition, or as made by him.
So Gussetius renders it, "who made him" (u); that is, the king; even
God, the three divine Persons, Father, Son, and Spirit; the word being
plural.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ecc 2:13</span></span>

Then I sat that wisdom excelleth folly,.... However, this upon a review
of things he could not but own, that natural wisdom and knowledge,
though there was no true happiness and satisfaction in them, yet they
greatly exceeded folly and madness;

as far as light excelleth darkness; as the light of the day the darkness
of the night; the one is pleasant and delightful, the other very
uncomfortable; the one useful to direct in walking, the other very
unsafe to walk in: light sometimes signifies joy and prosperity, and
darkness adversity; the one is used to express the light of grace, and
the other the darkness of sin and ignorance; now as the natural light
exceeds darkness, and prosperity exceeds adversity and calamities, and a
state of grace exceeds a state of sin and wickedness, so wisdom exceeds
folly.

[Ecclesiastes 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ecc 2:14</span></span>

The wise man's eyes are in his head,.... And so are the eyes of every
man; but the sense is, he makes use of them, he looks about him, and
walks circumspectly; he takes heed to his goings, he foresees the evil,
and avoids it; or the danger he is exposed unto, and guards against it.
Some understand it, in a more spiritual and evangelical sense, of
Christ, who is the head of the body the church, and of every true
believer; of everyone that is wise unto salvation, whose eyes are on him
alone for righteousness, salvation, and eternal life; or on whom
Christ's eyes are; who is said to have seven eyes, with which he guides,
guards, and protects his people;

but the fool walketh in darkness; his eyes are to the ends of the earth;
he walks incautiously, without any circumspection or guard; he knows not
where he is, nor where he is going, nor where he shall set his foot
next, nor at what he may stumble; wherefore a wise man is to be
preferred to a fool, as wisdom is to folly. The Midrash interprets the
wise man of Abraham, and the fool of Nimrod;

and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all; the
wise man and the fool; or, "but I myself perceived" (w), &c. though it
is allowed that a wise man is better than a fool; yet this also must be
owned, which Solomon's experience proved, and every man's does, that the
same things befall wise men and fools; they are liable to the same
diseases of body, and disasters of life; to poverty and distress, to
loss of estate, children, and friends, and to death itself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ecc 2:15</span></span>

Then said I in my heart, as it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth
even to me,.... The wisest of kings, and the wisest of men; that is, he
looked over things in his mind, and considered what had befallen him, or
what were his present circumstances, or what would be his case,
especially at death; and said within himself, the same things happen to
me, who have attained to the highest pitch of wisdom, as to the most
errant fool; and therefore no true happiness can be in this sort of
wisdom. The Targum paraphrases it thus,

"as it happened to Saul the son of Kish, the king who turned aside
perversely, and kept not the commandment he received concerning Amalek,
and his kingdom was taken from him; so shall it happen to me;''

and why was I then more wise? the Targum adds, than he, or than any
other man, or even than a fool; why have I took so much pains to get
wisdom? what am I the better for it? what happiness is there in it,
seeing it gives me no advantage, preference, and excellency to a fool;
or secures me from the events that befall me?

Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity; this worldly wisdom
has nothing solid and substantial in it, as well as pleasure; and it is
a vain thing to seek happiness in it, since this is the case, that the
events are the same to men that have it, as to one that has it not.

[Ecclesiastes 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ecc 2:16</span></span>

For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for
ever,.... The Targum interprets it, in the world to come; but even in
this world the remembrance of a wise man, any more than of a fool, does
not always last; a wise man may not only be caressed in life, but may be
remembered after death for a while; the fame of him may continue for a
little time, and his works and writings may be applauded; but by and by
rises up another genius brighter than he, or at least is so thought, and
outshines him; and then his fame is obscured, his writings are neglected
and despised, and he and his works buried in oblivion; and this is the
common course of things. This shows that Solomon is speaking of natural
wisdom, and of man's being wise with respect to that; and his
remembrance on that account; otherwise such who are truly good and wise,
their memory is blessed; they are had in everlasting remembrance, and
shall never be forgotten in this world, nor in that to come, when the
memory of the wicked shall rot; whose names are only written in the dust
[Jer 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#013.md), and not in the Lamb's book
of life;

seeing that which now is, in the days to come shall all be forgotten:
what now is in the esteem of men, and highly applauded by them; what is
in the mouths of men, and in their minds and memories, before long,
future time, after the death of a man, as the Targum, or in some time
after, will be thought of no more, and be as if it never had been, or as
if there never had been such men in the world. Many wise men have been
in the world, whose names are now unknown, and some their names only are
known, and their works are lost; and others whose works remain, yet in
no esteem: this is to be understood in general, and for the most part;
otherwise there may be some few exceptions to this general observation.

And how dieth the wise man? as the fool; they are both liable to death;
it is appointed for men, rinse or unwise, learned or unlearned, to die,
and both do die; wisdom cannot secure a man from dying; and then wise
and fools are reduced to the same condition and circumstances; all a
man's learning, knowledge, and wisdom, cease when he dies, and he is
just as another man is; in that day all his learned thoughts perish, and
he is upon a level with the fool. Solomon, the wisest of men, died as
others; a full proof of his own observation, and which his father made
before him, [Psa 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#010.md). But this is
not true of one that is spiritually wise, or wise unto salvation; the
death of a righteous man is different from the death of a wicked man;
both die, yet not alike, not in like manner; the good man dies in
Christ, he dies in faith, has hope in his death, and rises again to
eternal life. The Targum is,

"and how shall the children of men say, that the end of the righteous is
as the end of the wicked?''

[Ecclesiastes 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ecc 2:17</span></span>

Therefore I hated life,.... Not strictly and simply understood, since
life is the gift of God; and a great blessing it is, more than raiment,
and so dear to a man, that he will give all he has for it: but
comparatively, in comparison of the lovingkindness of God, which is
better than life; or in comparison of eternal life, which a good man
desires to depart from this world, for the sake of enjoying it. The
sense seems to be this, that since the case of wise men and fools was
equal, he had the less love for life, the less regard to it, the less
desire to continue in it; no solid happiness being to be enjoyed in
anything under the sun: though some think that he was even weary of
life, impatient of it, as Job, Jonah, and others have been. The Targum
is,

"I hate all evil life:''

Alshech interprets it of the good things of this world, which were the
cause of hurt unto him; and Aben Ezra understands, by life, living
persons;

because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me;
which was either wrought by himself; particularly his hard studies, and
eager pursuits after knowledge and wisdom, which were a weariness to his
flesh; or which were done by others, especially evil ones: so the
Targum,

"for evil to me is an evil work, which is done by the children of men
under the sun in this world;''

for all is vanity and vexation of spirit; See Gill on [Ecc
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#014.md).

[Ecclesiastes 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ecc 2:18</span></span>

Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun,.... The
great works he made, the houses he built; the vineyards, gardens, and
orchards he planted, &c. what he got by his labour, his riches and
wealth; and what he also got, not by the labour of his hands, but of his
mind. Some understand this of the books he wrote; which were a weariness
to his body, and fatigue to his mind; and which he might fear some
persons would make an ill use of: Aben Ezra interprets it of his labour
in this book. All which he had no great regard unto, since it was to be
left to another;

because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me; because
he could not enjoy the fruits of his labour himself, at least but a very
short time: but must be obliged to leave all to another, his
possessions, estates, riches, and treasure; which a man cannot carry
with him when he dies, but must leave all behind him, to his heirs and
successors (x). The Targum is,

"because I shall leave it to Rehoboam my son, who shall come after me;
and Jeroboam his servant shall come and take ten tribes out of his
hands, and possess half the kingdom.''

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ecc 2:19</span></span>

And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool?.... The king
that should be after him, as the Targum, that should be his successor
and heir; and so whether he would make a good or bad use of what was
left; whether he would keep and improve it, or squander it away;
suggesting, that could he be sure he would be a wise man that should
come into his labours, it would be some satisfaction to him that he had
laboured, and such a man should have the benefit of it; but as it was a
precarious thing what he would be, he could take no pleasure in
reviewing his labours he was about to leave. Some think that Solomon
here gives a hint of the suspicion he had, that his son Rehoboam, his
successor and heir, would turn out a foolish man, as he did;

yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and
wherein I have showed myself wise, under the sun; be he what he will,
all will come into his hands; and he will have the power of disposing of
all at his pleasure; not only of enjoying it, but of changing and
altering things; and perhaps greatly for the worse, if he does not
entirely destroy what has been wrought with so much care and industry,
toil and labour, wisdom and prudence; the thought of all which was
afflicting and distressing: and therefore he adds,

This is also vanity; and shows there is no happiness in all that a man
does, has, or enjoys; and this circumstance, before related, adds to his
vexation and unhappiness.

[Ecclesiastes 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ecc 2:20</span></span>

Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair,.... Of ever finding
happiness in anything here below. He "turned about" (y), as the word
signifies dropped his severe studies of wisdom, and his eager pursuits
of pleasure; and desisted from those toilsome works, in which he had
employed himself; and went from one thing to another, and settled and
stuck at nothing, on purpose to relax his mind, as the Syriac version
renders it; to divest it of all anxious thought and care, and call it
off from its vain and fruitless undertakings; and be no more concerned
about or thoughtful

of all the labour which I took under the sun; and what will be the
consequence and issue of it; but quietly leave all to an all wise
disposing Providence; and not seek for happiness in anything under the
sun, but in those things that are above it; not in this world, but in
the world to come.

For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in
equity,.... Who does all he does, in natural, civil, and religious
things, in the state, in his family, and the world, and whatsoever
business he is engaged, in the wisest and best manner, with the utmost
honesty and integrity, according to all the rules of wisdom and
knowledge, and of justice and equity; meaning himself; the Midrash
interprets this of God;

yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his
portion; to his son, heir, and successor; who never took any pains, or
joined with him, in acquiring the least part of it; and yet all comes
into his hands, as his possession and inheritance: the Targum interprets
this of a man that dies without children; and so others (z) understand
it of his leaving his substance to strangers, and not to his children.

This also is vanity, and a great evil; not anything sinful and criminal,
but vexatious and distressing.

For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his
heart?.... What profit has he by it, when there is so much vexation in
it, both in getting it, and in the thought of leaving it to others? What
advantage is it to him, when it is all acquired for and possessed by
another; and especially of what use is it to him after his death? Even
of all

wherein he hath laboured under the sun? the Targum adds, "in this
world"; though he has been labouring all his days, yet there is not one
thing he has got by his labour that is of any real advantage to him, or
can yield him any solid comfort and satisfaction, or bring him true
happiness, or lead him to it.

[Ecclesiastes 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ecc 2:23</span></span>

For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief,.... All his days
are full of sorrows, of a variety of them; and all his affairs and
transactions of life are attended with grief and trouble; not only the
days of old age are evil ones, in which he can take no pleasure; or
those times which exceed the common age of man, when he is got to
fourscore years or more, and when his strength is labour and sorrow; but
even all his days, be they fewer or more, from his youth upward, are all
evil and full of trouble, [Gen 47:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#009.md);

yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night; which is appointed for rest
and ease; and when laid down on his bed for it, as the word signifies;
yet, either through an eager desire of getting wealth, or through
anxious and distressing cares for the keeping it when gotten, he cannot
sleep quietly and comfortably, his carking cares and anxious thoughts
keep him waking; or, if he sleeps, his mind is distressed with dreams
and frightful apprehensions of things, so that his sleep is not sweet
and refreshing to him.

This is also vanity; or one of the vanities which belong to human life.

[Ecclesiastes 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ecc 2:24</span></span>

There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink,....
Not in an immoderate and voluptuous manner, like the epicure and the
atheist, that disbelieve a future state and the resurrection of the
dead, and give up themselves to all sinful and sensual gratifications;
but in a moderate way, enjoying in a cheerful and comfortable manner the
good creatures of God, which he has given; being contented with them,
thankful for them, and looking upon them as the blessings of divine
goodness, and as flowing from the love of God to him; and thus freely
using, and yet not abusing them. Some render it, "it is not good for a
man to eat" (a), &c. immoderately and to excess, and to place his
happiness in it: or, "there is no good with man" (b); it is not in the
power of man to use the creatures aright. Jarchi renders it by way of
interrogation, "is it not good?" which comes to the same sense with
ours, and so the Vulgate Latin version;

and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour; not leave off
labouring; nor eat and drink what he has not laboured for, or what is
the fruit of other men's labour; but what is the effect of his own, and
in which he continues; and this is the way to go on in it with
cheerfulness, when he enjoys the good, and reaps the benefit and
advantage of it; which is certainly preferable to a laying up his
substance, and leaving it to he knows not who.

This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God; not only the riches a
man possesses, but the enjoyment of them, or a heart to make use of
them; see [Ecc 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#018.md). The Midrash
interprets this eating and drinking, of the law and good works: and the
Targum explains it, causing the soul to enjoy the good of doing the
commandments, and walking in right ways; and observes, that a man that
prospers in this world, it is from the hand of the Lord, and is what is
decreed to be concerning him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ecc 2:25</span></span>

For who can eat?.... Who should eat, but such a man that has laboured
for it? or, who has a power to eat, that is, cheerfully, comfortably,
and freely to enjoy the good things of life he is possessed of, unless
it be given him of God? see [Ecc 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#001.md);

or who else can hasten hereunto more than I? the word "chush", in
Rabbinical language, is used of the five senses, seeing, hearing,
feeling, smelling, and tasting: and R. Elias says (c), there are some
that so interpret it here, "who has his sense better than I?" a quicker
sense, particularly of smelling and tasting what be eats, in which lies
much of the pleasure of eating; and this is of God; which interpretation
is not to be despised. Or, "who can prepare?" according to the Arabic
sense of the word (d); that is, a better table than I? No man had a
greater affluence of good things than Solomon, or had a greater variety
of eatables and drinkables; or had it in the power of his hands to live
well, and cause his soul to enjoy good; or was more desirous to partake
of pleasure, and hasten more to make the experiment of it in a proper
manner; and yet he found, that a heart to do this was from the Lord;
that this was a gift of his; and that though he abounded in the
blessings of life, yet if God had not given him a heart to use them, he
never should have really enjoyed them.

[Ecclesiastes 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ecc 2:26</span></span>

For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight,.... No man is of
himself good, or naturally so, but evil, very evil, as all the
descendants of Adam are; there are some that are good in their own eyes,
and in the sight of others, and yet not truly good; they are only really
good, who are so in the sight of God, who sees the heart, and knows what
is in man; they are such who are made good by his efficacious grace; who
are inwardly, and not merely outwardly so; who are good at heart, or who
have good hearts, clean hearts, new and right spirits created in them;
who have a good work of grace upon their hearts, and the several graces
of the Spirit implanted there; who have the good Spirit of God in them,
in whose heart Christ dwells by faith; and who have the good word of
Christ dwelling in them, and have a good treasure of rich experience of
the grace of God; and who, in one word, are born again, renewed in the
spirit of their minds, and live by faith on Jesus Christ. The phrase is
rendered, "whoso pleaseth God", [Ecc
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#026.md); and he is one that is accepted
with God in Christ, his beloved Son, in whom he is well pleased; who is
clothed with his righteousness, made comely through his comeliness, and
so is irreprovable in his sight; and who by faith looks to and lays hold
on this righteousness, and does all he does in the exercise of faith,
without which it is impossible to please God. To such a man God gives

wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; wisdom to acquire knowledge, to keep,
use, and improve it; and joy, to be cheerful and thankful for the good
things of life: or rather this may design, not natural wisdom, but
spiritual wisdom, wisdom in the hidden part, so as to be wise unto
salvation, and to walk wisely and circumspectly, a good man's steps
being ordered by the Lord; and knowledge of God in Christ, and of
Christ, and of the things of the Gospel, and which relate to eternal
life; and so spiritual joy, joy and peace in believing, in the presence
of God, and communion with him; joy in Christ, and in hope of the glory
of God, even joy unspeakable, and full of glory; all which, more or
less, at one time or another, God gives to those who are truly good; and
which is not to be found in worldly wisdom, pleasure, riches, power, and
authority: the Targum is,

"to the man, whose works are right before God, he gives wisdom and
knowledge in this world, and joy with the righteous in the world to
come;''

but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up; to gather
mammon, and to heap up a large possession, as the Targum; to gather
together a great deal of riches, but without wisdom and knowledge to use
them, without any proper enjoyment of them, or pleasure in them; all he
has is a deal of trouble and care to get riches, without any comfort in
them, and he has them not for his own use: the Midrash illustrates this
of the good man and sinner, by the instances of Abraham and Nimrod, of
Isaac and Abimelech, of Jacob and Laban, of the Israelites and
Canaanites, of Hezekiah and Sennacherib, and of Mordecai and Haman. But

that he may give to him that is good before God; so it is ordered by
divine Providence sometimes, that all that a wicked man has been
labouring for all his days should come into the hands of such who are
truly good men, and will make a right use of what is communicated to
them.

This also is vanity, and vexation of spirit; not to the good man, but to
the wicked man: so the Targum,

"it is vanity to the sinner, a breaking of spirit;''

it grieves him that such a man should have what he has been labouring
for; or it would, if he knew it.
