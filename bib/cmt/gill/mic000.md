INTRODUCTION TO MICAH

This book is called, in the Hebrew copies, "Sepher Micah", the Book of
Micah; in the Vulgate Latin version "the Prophecy of Micah"; and in the
Syriac version "the Prophecy of the Prophet Micah". This prophet is not
the same with Micaiah the son of Imiah, who lived in the times of Ahab
and Jehoshaphat, [Kg1 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#008.md); for, as
Aben Ezra observes, there were many generations between them, at least
many reigns of kings, as Jehoram, Ahaziah, Joash, Amaziah, and Uzziah,
all which made up a hundred and thirty years; their names indeed seem to
be the same, since he that is called Micaiah, [Kg1
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#008.md); is called Micah, [Ch2
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#014.md); and this our prophet is named
Micaiah in [Jer 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#018.md); which is with
some of the same signification with Michael. So Abarbinel interprets,
it, "who \[is\] as God"; see [Mic
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#018); which Hillerus (a.md) confutes, and
renders it, "the contrition, attrition, attenuation, and depauperation,
of the Lord"; deriving it from Kwm, which signifies to be depressed,
humbled, weakened, and impoverished, as others do; which name, some
think, was given him by his parents, because of their low estate, their
meanness and poverty; but of them we have no account: however, this is
much more probable than the reason Cornelius a Lapide gives of his name,
that he was so called because he prophesied of Christ, who was poor, and
that he should be born in a poor country village. As for his country,
and the place of his birth, and the time in which he lived, they may be
gathered from [Mic 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#001.md); by which it
will appear that he was not of the tribe of Ephraim, as
Pseudo-Epiphanius (b) says but of the tribe of Judah; whose kings'
reigns in which he prophesies are only made mention of; though his
prophecies concerned both Israel and Judah, and he reproves both for
their sins, and foretells their various captivities; and, for the
comfort of God's people, says many things concerning the Messiah, his
incarnation the place of his birth, which no prophet so clearly points
at as he, the execution of his offices, prophetic, priestly, and kingly;
the blessings of grace that came by him, pardon of sin, atonement, &c.
and the happiness and glory of his church in the latter day. The
authority of this book is confirmed both by the elders of Judah in the
times of Jeremiah, who quote a passage out of it; [Mic
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012.md); which they improve in favour of
that prophet, [Jer 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#017.md); and by the
chief priests and Scribes in the time of Herod, who refer that prince to
a prophecy in this book for the place of the Messiah's birth, [Mic
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002.md); see [Mat
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#004.md). He is thought to have prophesied
thirty or forty years, Bishop Usher (c) places him in the year of the
world 3291 A.M., and 713 B.C.; but, according to Mr. Whiston (d), he
prophesied 750 B.C., and so Mr. Bedford (e), and three after the
building of the city of Rome; and he foretells the captivity of the ten
tribes thirty years, and the coming of Sennacherib forty years, before
they came to pass; but when and where he died, and was buried, no
certain proof can be given. Pseudo-Epiphanius, confounding him with
Micaiah in Ahab's time, says (f) he was killed by his son Joram, who
cast him down from a precipice, and was buried at Morathi, his native
place, near the burying ground of Enakeim, and his grave was well known
to that day. And, according to Jerom (g), the grave of this our prophet
was at Morasthi, and in his time turned into a church or temple. Sozomen
(h) reports, that, in the times of Theodosius the elder, the body of
Micah was found by Zebennus bishop of Eleutheropolis at Berathsalia, a
mile and a quarter from the city, near which was the grave of Micah,
called by the common people the faithful monument, and in their country
language Nephsameemana.
