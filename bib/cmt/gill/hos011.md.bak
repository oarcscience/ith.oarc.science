[Hosea](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001.md)

INTRODUCTION TO HOSEA 11

This chapter gives an account of the free and ancient love of God to
Israel, and of the benefits and blessings of goodness he bestowed upon
them; and of their ingratitude in not owning them, nor hearkening to his
prophets, but sacrificing and burning incense to idols, [Hos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001.md); wherefore they are threatened
with disappointment of relief from Egypt, with captivity into Assyria,
and with the ravages of the sword in all places, being a people bent to
backsliding, and incorrigible, [Hos
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#005.md); and yet, notwithstanding all
this, the bowels of the Lord yearn after them, and promises of mercy are
made to them; that they shall not utterly be destroyed, but a remnant
shall be spared; which in the latter day shall be called and follow
after the Lord, the King Messiah, and be returned from their captivity,
and be resettled in their own land, and replaced in their own houses,
[Hos 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008.md); the chapter is concluded
with an honourable character of Judah, [Hos
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#012.md).

[Hosea 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 11:1</span></span>

When Israel was a child, then I loved him,.... Or, "for Israel was a
child" (u); a rebellious and disobedient one, therefore his king was cut
off in a morning, and he has been, and will be, without a king many
days; yet still "I loved him": or, "though Israel was a child" (w); a
weak, helpless, foolish, and imprudent one, "yet I loved him": or, "when
a child"; in the infancy of his civil and church state, when in Egypt,
and in the wilderness; the Lord loved him, not only as his creature, as
he does all the works of his hands, but with a more special love than he
loved others; choosing them to be a special people above all others;
giving them his law, his statutes, and his judgments, his word and his
worship, which he did not give to other nations. So he loves spiritual
and mystical Israel, all the elect of God, whether Jews or Gentiles,
when children, as soon as born, and though born in sin, carnal and
corrupt; yea, before they are born, and when having done neither good
nor evil; and so may be expressive both of the earliness and antiquity
of his love to them, and of the freeness of it, without any merits or
motives of theirs;

and called my son out of Egypt, not literal Israel, as before, whom God
called his son, and his firstborn, and demanded his dismission from
Pharaoh, and called him, and brought him out of Egypt with a mighty hand
and outstretched arm; and which was a type of his calling spiritual
Israel, his adopted sons, out of worse than Egyptian bondage and
darkness: but his own natural and only begotten Son, our Lord Jesus
Christ; for these words are expressly said to be fulfilled in him, [Mat
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#015.md); not by way of allusion; or by
accommodation of phrases; or as the type is fulfilled in the antitype;
or as a proverbial expression, adapted to any deliverance; but
literally: the first and only sense of the words respects Christ, who in
his infancy was had to Egypt for shelter from Herod's rage and fury,
and, when he was dead, and those that sought the life of Jesus, he was
by an angel of the Lord, warning Joseph of it, called out of Egypt, and
brought into Judea, [Mat 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#019.md); and
this as a proof of the love of God to Israel; which as it was expressed
to him in his infancy, it continued and appeared in various instances,
more or less unto the coming of Christ; who, though obliged for a while
to go into Egypt, must not continue there, but must be called from
thence, to be brought up in the land of Judea; to do his miracles,
preach his doctrines, and do good to the bodies and souls of men there,
being sent particularly to the lost sheep of the house of Israel; and,
above all, in order to work out the salvation and redemption of his
special people among them, and of the whole Israel of God everywhere
else; which is the greatest instance of love to them, and to the world
of the Gentiles, that ever was known, [Joh
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016.md) [Jo1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#002.md).

[Hosea 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 11:2</span></span>

As they called them, so they went from them,.... That is, the prophets
of the Lord, the true prophets, called Israel to the worship and service
of God; but they turned a deaf ear to them, and their backs upon them;
and the more they called to them, the further they went from them, and
from the way of their duty; see [Hos
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#007.md). So the Targum,

"I sent the prophets to teach them, but they wandered from them;''

Moses and Aaron were sent unto them, and called them out of Egypt, but
they hearkened not unto them; see [Exo
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#009.md); in later times the prophets were
sent unto them, to exhort them to their duty, and to reclaim them from
their evil ways, but they despised and refused to attend to their advice
and instructions; and this was continued to the times of Israel, or the
ten tribes, departing from the house of David, and setting up idolatrous
worship; and during their revolt and apostasy: but all in vain. So after
Christ was called out of Egypt, he and his apostles, and John the
Baptist before them, called them to hearken to him, but they turned away
from them. Aben Ezra interprets it of the false prophets, who called
them to idolatry, and they went after them. Schmidt understands it of
the Israelites calling one another to it, and going after it, for their
own sakes, and because it pleased them, and was agreeable to them;

they sacrificed to Baalim, and burnt incense to graven images: they
joined themselves to Baalpeor, and worshipped the golden calf, fashioned
with a graving tool, in the wilderness; they sacrificed to Baalim, one
or another of them, in the times of the judges, and of Ahab, and
committed idolatry with other graven images, of which burning incense is
a part. And the Jews in Christ's time, instead of hearkening to him and
his apostles, followed the traditions of the elders, and the dictates of
the Scribes and Pharisees, who were their Baals, their lords and masters
and they sought for life and righteousness by their own works, which was
sacrificing to their net, and burning incense to their drag; all this
was great ingratitude. Next follows a narrative of other benefits done
to this people.

[Hosea 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 11:3</span></span>

I taught Ephraim also to go,.... All the tribes of Israel and Ephraim,
or the ten tribes with the rest; these the Lord instructed in the way of
his commandments, and taught them to walk therein; he his angel before
them, to conduct them through the wilderness; yea, he himself went
before them in the pillar of cloud by day, and in the pillar of fire by
night, to which history this seems to refer. So the Targum,

"I, by an angel sent by me, led Israel in the right way.''

The allusion seems to be to a mother or nurse accommodating herself to
her child, beginning to go; she stoops down, sets it on its feet, and
one foot before another, forms its steps, teaches it how to go, and
walks its pace with it. And in like manner the Lord deals with his
spiritual Israel, his regenerated ones, who become like little children,
and are used as such; as in regeneration they are quickened, and have
some degree of spiritual strength given them, they are taught to go;
they are taught what a Saviour Christ is, and their need of him; they
are instructed to go to him by faith for everything they want, and to
walk by faith on him, as they have received him; and having heard and
learned of the Father, they go to Christ, [Joh
6:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#045.md); and are taught also to go to the
throne of grace for all supplies of grace; and to the house of God, to
attend the word and ordinances, for the benefit of their souls; and to
walk in the ways of the Lord, for his glory, and their good;

taking them by their arms; or "on his own arms" (x); bearing and
carrying them in his arms, as a father his son; see [Deu
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#031.md) [Num
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#012.md); so the Lord deals with his
spiritual Israel, either holding them by their arms while walking, as
nurses their children, to help and ease them in walking, and that they
may not stumble and fall; so the Lord holds up the goings of his people
in his ways, that their footsteps slip not, and upholds them with the
right hand of his righteousness: or taking them up in his own arms when
weary, he carries them in his bosom; or, when they are failing or
fallen, lays hold on them, and takes them up again; and so they are not
utterly cast down, whether the fall is into sin, or into some calamity
and affliction; when he puts underneath his everlasting arms, and bears
them and keeps them from sinking, as well as from a final and total
falling away. Abarbinel, and others after him, interpret this of Ephraim
taking up and carrying in his arms Baalim, the graven images and golden
calves; which is mentioned as an instance of ingratitude; but very
wrongly;

but they knew not that I healed them; of the diseases of Egypt, or
preserved them from them: this includes the whole of their salvation and
deliverance from Egypt, and all the benefits and favours accompanying
it, which they imputed to their idols, and not to the Lord; see [Exo
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#026.md). "Healing", in a spiritual
sense, generally signifies the forgiveness of sin, which the Lord's
people may have, and not know it; and, through want of better light and
knowledge, may also ascribe it to their repentance, humiliation, and
tears, when it is alone owing to the grace of God, and blood of Christ.

[Hosea 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 11:4</span></span>

I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love,.... As Ephraim is
compared to a heifer in the preceding chapter, here he is said to be
drawn; but not with such cords and bands as cattle are, but with such as
men are; in a rational and gentle way, in a kind, loving, tender,
humane, friendly, and fatherly way and manner; so the Lord drew Israel
on in the wilderness, till he was brought to Canaan's land, by bestowing
kind favours upon them, and by making precious promises to them. So the
Lord deals with his spiritual Israel; he draws them out of the present
state and circumstances, in which they are by nature, to himself, and to
his Son, and to follow after him, and run in the ways of his
commandments; and which he does not by force and compulsion against
their wills, nor by mere moral persuasion, but by the invincible power
of his grace, sweetly working upon them, and attracting them; he does it
by revealing Christ in them, in the glories of his person and in the
riches of his grace, and by letting in his love into their hearts; and
by kind invitations, precious promises, and divine teachings, attended
with his powerful and efficacious grace; see [Jer
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#003.md);

and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws; as one
that is merciful to his beast; as a kind and humane husbandman, when his
cattle have been hard at work, takes off their bridles or muzzles, or
the yokes on them, fastened with a halter about their jaws, that they
may have liberty to feed on food set before them, as the next clause
shows. So the Targum,

"my word was to them as a good husbandman, who lightens the shoulder of
oxen, and looses "the bridles" on their jaws.''

This may refer to Israel's deliverance from their bondage in Egypt; and
be spiritually applied to Christ, the essential Word of God, breaking
and taking the yoke of sin, Satan, and the law from off his people, and
bringing them into the liberty of the children of God. Schmidt reads and
interprets the words quite otherwise, "and I was to them as they that
lift up the yoke upon their jaws"; not remove it from them but put it on
them; expressing their ignorance and ingratitude, who, when the Lord
drew them in the kind and loving manner he did, reckoned it as if he put
a yoke upon them, and treated them rather as beasts than men; but this
seems not to agree with what follows:

and I laid meat unto them: or declined, or brought it down to them, to
their very mouths; referring to the manna and quails he rained about
their tents. So the Targum,

"and, even when they were in the wilderness, I multiplied to them good
things to eat.''

And thus in a spiritual sense the Lord gives meat to them that fear him,
while in the wilderness of this world; he brings it near, and sets it
before them, in the ministry of the word and ordinances; even that meat
which endures to everlasting life, the flesh of Christ, which is meat
indeed; and the doctrines of the Gospel, which are milk for babes, and
strong meat for more experienced saints.

[Hosea 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 11:5</span></span>

He shall not return into the land of Egypt,.... Ephraim or Israel, the
ten tribes: and the Septuagint and Arabic versions express them by name,
though they give a wrong sense of the words, rendering them, "and
Ephraim dwelt in Egypt"; he did so indeed with the other tribes
formerly; but here it is said he shall not go thither again to be a
captive there, but shall go into bondage more severe than that in Egypt,
even into captivity in Assyria: rather the sense is, they should not go
thither for shelter, at least not as a body, though some few of them
might, as in [Hos 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#003.md); the far greater
part of them should he carried captive by the Assyrians: or they should
not return to Egypt to seek for help and assistence, as they had done;
either they ought not to do it, nor would there be any need of it, did
they but return to the Lord, as Kimchi observes; or rather they should
now be so straitly shut up in Samaria, besieged so closely by the enemy,
or else carried into distant lands, that, if they would, they could not
apply to Egypt for relief;

but the Assyrian shall be his king; the king of Assyria shall be king
over the ten tribes, whether they want him or not; they shall be forced
to acknowledge him as their king, and be subject to him, being taken and
carried captive into his land:

because they refused to return: to the Lord, from whom they had
backslidden, and to his pure worship, word, and ordinances, they had
departed from, setting up the calves at Dan and Bethel; they refused to
relinquish worshipping idols instead of the true God; thus ungratefully
behaving to him for all the above favours bestowed upon them; wherefore
they are righteously threatened with captivity and bondage in Assyria.

[Hosea 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 11:6</span></span>

And the sword shall abide on the cities,.... Or "shall fall" (y), and
continue; meaning the sword of the Assyrians, whereby Ephraim should be
brought into subjection to them, and the king of Assyria become king
over them; his sword should be drawn, and rest upon them, not only on
their chief city Samaria, besieged three years by him, but upon all
their other cities, which would fall into his hands, with the
inhabitants of them:

and shall consume his branches, and devour them; that is, the towns and
villages adjoining to the cities; which were to them as branches are to
a tree, sprung from them, and were supported by them; and, being near
them, prospered or suffered as they did: some render it, "his bars" (z),
as the word is sometimes used, and interpret it of the great men and
nobles of the land. So the Targum,

"and it shall slay his mighty men, and destroy his princes;''

with which Jarchi agrees;

because of their own counsels; which they took and pursued, contrary to
the counsel of God, the revelation of his mind and will; particularly in
setting up idolatrous worship, and continuing in it, notwithstanding all
the admonitions, exhortations, counsels, and threatenings of God by his
prophets; or else because of their counsels with the Egyptians, and
their covenants with them, for help against the Assyrian, whose yoke
they were for casting off, and refused to pay tribute to; which provoked
him to draw his sword upon them, which made the havoc it did in their
cities, and the inhabitants of them.

[Hosea 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 11:7</span></span>

And my people are bent to backsliding from me,.... There is a propensity
in thorn to it, through prevailing corruption in them; they are inclined
unto it, the bias of their minds is that way; they are bent upon it, and
pertinaciously abide in it; nor will they be reclaimed from it, by all
the means and methods made use of, even though they had been, and
professed themselves to be the people of God. Some understand this, not
of their backsliding and aversion from God; but either of his return to
them, or of their return to him, rendering the words, "and my people are
in suspense" (a); like a man that hangs in the air, as Aben Ezra,
neither ascends nor descends; that is, they are in doubt of what should
be done to thorn, or they themselves should do: either "about my return"
(b); that is, to them; whether after all they may expect that God would
be kind and merciful to them, so Abarbinel: or "about return to me" (c);
whether they should or not, inclining rather not to return. So the
Targum,

"my people divide (or hesitate) to return to my law;''

with which Jarchi agrees, paraphrasing it,

"when the prophets instruct them to return unto me, they are in suspense
whether to return or not;''

but Aben Ezra and Kimchi observe the word is always used in a bad sense,
of aversion or backsliding, and that the word is in another form when
used for repentance or returning;

though they called them to the most High; that is, the prophets of the
Lord called them to turn from their idols, and return to the most high
God, the true and the living God, from whom they had backslidden, and to
his true worship, they had neglected and forsaken:

none at all would exalt him; the most high God, and give him the praise
and glory due to his name; but, on the other hand, extolled their idols,
and ascribed all their good things to them: or "none would exalt them"
(d) the prophets of the Lord that called them; would not give that
honour to them that was due to their office, or pay any regard to them,
or to their admonitions and advice, but depreciated them, and reproached
and persecuted them: or "none at all would lift up": that is, their
head, as Aben Ezra, toward the heaven, and to God in it, to whom they
were called; but kept looking on the earth, and to earthly things,
particularly to their idols; and did not lift up or erect their ears, to
hearken to what was said to them, but were deaf to all counsel and
reproof. The Targum is,

"they walked not in an erect stature.''

Agreeably to which the former clause may be rendered, as by some, "and
they called them to things above"; but none would look upwards; See Gill
on [Hos 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#016.md).

[Hosea 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 11:8</span></span>

How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee,

Israel?.... That is, as usually interpreted, into the hand of the enemy,
or unto wrath, ruin, and destruction; for, notwithstanding all the sins
of this people before observed, and the punishment threatened to be
inflicted on them, the Lord is pleased here, and in the following
verses, to give some intimations of his goodness, grace, and mercy to
them; not to the whole body of them, for they as such were given and
delivered up to the enemy, and carried captive, and dispersed among the
nations, and were never recovered to this day; but to a remnant among
them, according to the election of grace, that should spring from them,
for the sake of which they were not all cut off by the sword; but were
reserved as a seed for later times, the times of the Messiah, which the
prophecy in this and the following words has respect unto; not only the
first times of the Gospel, when some of the dispersed of Israel were met
with by it, and converted under it; but the last times of it; times yet
to come, when all Israel shall be saved; and may be applied to the elect
of God, in all ages, and of all nations, The words are generally
understood as a debate in the divine mind, struggling within itself
between justice and mercy; justice requiring the delivery of these
persons unto it, and mercy being reluctant thereunto, pleading on their
behalf; and which at last gets the victory, and rejoices against
judgment. There is a truth in all this; justice seems to demand that
sinners, as such, who have injured and affronted him, be given up to,
him, and suffer the curse of the law, according to their deserts, and be
delivered unto death, even eternal death, as well as to temporal
punishments; and which might be expected would be the case, by the
instances and examples of the angels that sinned, and of the men of the
old world, and of the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah; but mercy
cannot bear it, pleads against; it, and asks how can it be done, since
these are my children, my dear child, on, pleasant ones, as Ephraim was,
my chosen and my covenant ones, and, besides, for whom provision is made
in Christ for the satisfactions of justice? But the sense is rather
this, "how might" or "could I give thee up; Ephraim? how might" or
"could I deliver thee, Israel" (e)? that is, with what severity might I
deal with thee? and how justly and righteously could I do it? since thy
sins are so many, and so great;

how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboim? two
cities that were utterly destroyed by fire from heaven, along with Sodom
and Gomorrah, [Deu 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#023.md); how justly
could I have made thee, and put thee in, the same condition and
circumstances, as those two cities, and the inhabitants of them, who
were so severely punished for their sins, and were never restored again?
signifying, that inasmuch as they were guilty of the same or like
heinous sins, was he utterly to destroy them, and cut them off from the
face of the earth, he should not exceed the due bounds of justice. To
this sense Schmidt interprets the words. The design of which is to show
the greatness of Ephraim's sins, as deserving the uttermost wrath and
vengeance of God, and to magnify the riches of God's grace in their
salvation, as next expressed; and it is true of all God's elect, who,
considered as sinners in Adam, and by their own transgressions, both
before and after conversion, deserved to be treated according to the
rigour of justice; but God is merciful to them, according to his choice
of them, covenant with them, and provision he has made in Christ, and
upon the foot of his satisfaction;

mine heart is turned within me; not changed; for there is no shadow of
turning with the Lord, neither in his mind and purposes, which he never
turns from, nor can be turned back; nor in his affections for them; as
his heart is never turned from love to hatred, so neither from hatred to
love; or his love would not be from everlasting, as it is, and he rest
in it as he does; but this expresses the strong motion of mercy in him
towards his people, springing from his sovereign will and pleasure, and
what is elsewhere signified by the troubling, soundings, and yearnings
of his bowels towards them; see [Jer
31:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#020.md); with which compare [Lam
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#020.md);

my repentings are kindled together; not that repentance properly belongs
to God, who is neither man, nor the Son of Man, that he should repent of
anything, [Num 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#019.md); he repents not
of his love to his people, nor of his choice of them, nor of his
covenant with them, nor of his special gifts and grace bestowed on them;
but he sometimes does what men do when they repent, he changes his
outward conduct and behaviour in the dispensations of his providence,
and acts the reverse of what he had done, or seemed to be about to do;
as, with respect to the old world, the making of Saul king, and the case
of the Ninevites, [Gen 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#006.md); so here,
though he could, and seemed as if he would, go forth in a way of strict
justice, yet changes his course, and steers another way, without any
change of his will. The phrase expresses the warmth and ardour of his
affections to his people; how his heart burned with love to them, his
bowels and inward parts were inflamed with it; from whence proceeded
what is called repentance among men, as in the case of Jeremiah, [Jer
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#009.md). The Targum is,

"the word of my covenant met me; my mercies (or bowels of mercies) were
rolled together.''

\(e\) "quam juste et misere desolatum te dabo? dare jure deberem et
possem?" Schmidt. So Luther and Tarnovius.

[Hosea 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 11:9</span></span>

I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger,.... That is, his wrath
and fury to the uttermost; his people are deserving of his wrath as
others, being by nature children of wrath as the rest; which they are
sensible of under spiritual conviction, and therefore flee from it,
where they may be safe: and though the Lord often chastises and afflicts
them, yet not in wrath; or however but in a little wrath, as it seems to
them; he does not stir up all his wrath, nor any in reality; all being
poured upon his Son, their surety, who saves and delivers them from
wrath to come;

I will not return to destroy Ephraim; or "again", or "any more, destroy"
(f) him; not twice; he might be destroyed when carried captive into
Assyria; but the remnant that shall spring from him in the latter day
shall not be destroyed, but saved. The Targum is,

"my word shall not return to destroy the house of Israel;''

or I will not return from my love and affections to them, I will never
be wroth with them any more; nor from my mercy to them, which is from
everlasting to everlasting; or from my covenant, promise, and resolution
to save them, they shall not be punished with everlasting destruction:

for I am God, and not man; a God gracious and merciful, longsuffering,
slow to anger, and pardoning sin, and not man, cruel, revengeful,
implacable, who shows no mercy when it is in the power of his hands to
avenge himself; or God that changes not in his purposes and counsels, in
his love and affections, and therefore the sons of Jacob are not
consumed, and not man that repents, is fickle, inconstant, and mutable;
or God that is faithful to his covenant and promises, and not man that
lies and deceives, promises and never performs. The Targum is,

"seeing I am God, my word remains for ever, and my works are not as the
works of the flesh (or of men) who dwell upon the earth;''

the Holy One in the midst of thee; being in the midst of his people, he
protects and defends them, and so they are safe; and being the Holy One
there, he sanctifies them, and saves them, in a way consistent with his
own holiness and justice: or there is "a Holy One", or Holy Ones, the
singular put for the plural, "in the midst of thee" (g); and therefore
thou shalt not be destroyed for their sakes, as Sodom would not, had
there been ten righteous persons in it, to which some think the allusion
is:

and I will not enter into the city; in a hostile way to destroy or
plunder it; but this is not to be understood either of Samaria or
Jerusalem, which were entered into in this manner. The Targum is,

"I have decreed by my word that my holy Shechinah shall be among you,
and I will not change Jerusalem again for another city;''

which sense the Jewish commentators follow; but, as this respects Gospel
times, the meaning seems to be, that God would dwell among his people
everywhere, and would not be confined to any city or temple as
heretofore; but wherever his church and people were, there would be his
temple, and there he would dwell.

[Hosea 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 11:10</span></span>

They shall walk after the Lord,.... That is, after the Messiah, who is
Jehovah our righteousness; that Jehovah the Jews pierced, and now shall
mourn at the sight of, being converted to him; for these are the chosen
of God among that people, who in the latter day shall partake of the
grace and favour before expressed, in consequence of which they shall be
set a seeking the Lord their God, and David their King; and, finding
him, shall follow after him, as sheep go after their shepherd, being led
by him into green pastures; as subjects follow their prince, obeying his
commands and orders; as soldiers march after their leader and commander,
so these after Christ, the great Captain of their salvation, part of
whose armies they will make: they will walk under the influence of his
grace, having life, strength, guidance, and direction, from him, which
walking implies; they will walk not after the flesh, as they now do, but
after the Spirit of Christ, taking him for their guide, by whom they
will be led into all truth, as it is in Jesus; they will walk in his
ways, in all the paths of faith and holiness, truth and righteousness;
in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, according to his
word. The Targum is,

"they shall go after the worship of the Lord;''

he shall roar like a lion: the Lord Christ they walk after; who is the
Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Israelites shall now follow after;
receiving, embracing, and confessing him the true Messiah. So the
Targum,

"and his Word shall be as a lion that roars;''

Christ, the essential Word of God: and so Jarchi, according to Lyra,
interprets it of the Messiah to come; who is compared to a lion for his
strength and courage, and for the fierceness of his wrath against his
enemies; and his voice, in his word, is like the roaring of a lion,
exceeding loud, and reaching far, even the uttermost parts of the earth;
as it did in the first times of the Gospel, and will in the last; and
which the Jews particularly, in each of the parts of the world, will
hear, and Gentiles also, and be affected with it; for it will be also
very strong, powerful, and efficacious; which is another reason of its
being compared to a lion roaring; see [Joe
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#016.md);

when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the west; the
children of Israel, the children of God, his adopted ones, whom he has
predestinated to the adoption of children; these, through the first
impressions of Christ's voice or word upon them, shall startle, and be
set a trembling, and be astonished, as Saul was, when called and
converted; as it is reported of the lion, that, when it roars, other
beasts are so terrified that they are quite stunned and amazed, and are
not able to stir; but though the first sound of the voice of Christ may
have some effect upon the Jews, yet this will not cause them to tremble
at him so as to flee from him, but to cause them to flee to him: for the
phrase is expressive of motion towards him, and to their own land, as
appears from [Hos 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#011.md); when filled
with a sense of his majesty and grace, they shall approach him with a
holy awe of him, with fear and trembling: or "come with honour" (h);
agreeably to [Sa1 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#004.md); having high,
honourable, and grand sentiments and apprehensions of him; so that this
trembling, at least, issues in a godly and filial fear and reverence of
him, suitable to their character as children. The phrase, "from the
west", or "from the sea" (i), meaning the Mediterranean sea, which lay
west of Judea, and is often used for the west, may signify the western
or European part of the world, where the Jews for the most part are, and
from whence they will be gathered. The Targum is,

"for he shall roar, and the captives shall be gathered from the west.''

[Hosea 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 11:11</span></span>

They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt,.... They shall come from
thence with fear and trembling; which may allude to the trembling of
birds at the roaring of a lion, or to the trembling motion of their
wings in flying; and denotes the swiftness of the motion of the
Israelites and Jews to Christ, and to his church and people, and to
their own land, under divine influence and direction: or "shall come
with honour" (k); with all readiness and cheerfulness, in the obedience
of faith:

and as a dove out of the land of Assyria; which is expressive of the
same things, the dove being both a timorous and swift creature. Birds in
common are very timorous, and tremble at any noise, and fearful of
everything that disturbs them, and therefore make all the haste and
speed they can to get out of the way, and to do which they are naturally
provided; and more especially the dove is always represented as very
fearful and trembling, especially when pursued by the hawk, as the poet
(l) observes. Though, it may be, these figures may only signify, as the
weak and impotent state of the Jews, considered in themselves at this
time, so the quick speed and haste they shall make to their own land.
And perhaps there may be something alluded to in the text, that may
refer to the dove as peculiar to Assyria, as it should seem to be. Now
it is said of Semiramis, an ancient queen of Assyria, that being exposed
when an infant, was nourished by doves, and at her death was turned into
one; and from hence it is not only said she had her name, which
signifies a dove, in the Syriac tongue, but doves by the Syrians were
worshipped as deities (m). And Derceto, a Syrian goddess, supposed to be
her mother, having a temple at Askelon, perhaps the above story may be
the reason why the inhabitants of that place reckoned doves so sacred
that they did not kill them; for Philo (n), who lived there some time,
having observed great numbers of them in the highways, and in every
house, asked the reason of it; and he was answered, that the citizens
were of old forbid the use of them: and it may be further observed,
that, in honour of Semiramis, the kings of Assyria bore a dove in their
coat of arms (o); but whether there is any thing peculiar or no in this
reference is not certain: and, besides what has been observed of the
fearfulness of this creature, and its swiftness and haste it makes in
flying, it may also denote the characters of meekness, humility, and
harmlessness, which the Jews, now converted, will have by the grace of
God, as well as their mournful disposition. Egypt and Assyria are
particularly mentioned, as they generally are where the return of Israel
and Judah into their own land is prophesied of, [Isa
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011.md); and may signify the Turks, in
whose possession these countries are, and among whom many Jews live: and
the one lying to the south, and the other to the north of Judea, and the
west being observed before, this shows that these people should be
gathered from all parts of the world, where they are dispersed; the east
is not mentioned, because their land they will be returned unto lies
there;

and I will place them in their houses, saith the Lord; it is not said in
towns and cities, and fortified places, but in houses, signifying that
they should dwell in their own land, in a civil sense, securely, and in
their habitations, under their vines and fig trees, being in no fear and
danger of enemies, and live in the utmost safety, under the government
and protection of the King Messiah; or, in a spiritual sense, they will
be placed in the congregations of the saints in the churches of Christ,
which will be as dove houses to them, and whither they shall fly as
doves to their windows, [Isa 60:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#008.md); and
it is observed of doves, that they fly the swiftest when they make to
their own houses: and at last, as all the people of God will, they will
be placed in the mansions of glory, in Christ's Father's house, those
everlasting habitations. These words, "saith the Lord", are added, for
the certain and sure accomplishment of all this. The Targum of the whole
is,

"as a bird which comes openly, so shall they come who are carried
captive into the land of Egypt; and as a dove that returns to its dove
house, so shall they return who are carried into the land of Assyria;
and I will return them in peace to their houses, and my word shall be
their protection, saith the Lord.''

[Hosea 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hos 11:12</span></span>

Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with
deceit,.... Here properly we should begin a new chapter, as many
interpreters and commentators do; for the prophet, or the Lord by him,
in [Hos 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#011.md), having finished his
predictions concerning the call and conversion of the Israelites, and
their return to their land, here begins a new discourse, by comparing
the characters of Ephraim and Judah, and thence descends to the sins and
punishment of both. The former, namely, Ephraim or Israel, that is, the
ten tribes, surrounded either the prophet, to hear him prophesy, and
professed a great regard to what he said; though it was all deceit and
flattery: or rather the Lord himself, whom they pretended to serve and
worship when they worshipped the calves at Dan and Bethel; and would
have it thought they did not worship them, but the Lord in them, and by
them, as the Papists now say of their images and image worship; but let
them not deceive themselves, God will not be mocked: or when they did at
any time seem to approach unto him in any branch of religious worship,
either to pray unto him, or to praise him, it was not done with
sincerity; it was only with their mouths, not with their hearts; these
agreed not together, but, like their ancestors of old, "they did
flatter, him with their mouth, and lied unto him with their tongues",
[Psa 78:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#036.md); and so all such professors
of religion, who are not sincere in their service and worship of God; or
meet together to speak and hear false doctrines, which are lies in
hypocrisy; or attend to superstition and will worship, and set up
ordinances and institutions of their own, neglecting those which are of
God, do as Ephraim did, encompass the Lord with lies and deceit;

but Judah yet ruleth with God; a theocracy was as yet acknowledged and
supported among them; God ruled in the midst of them, and; they ruled
with him; their kings ruled in the fear of God, and according to his
laws, statutes, and appointment, and not their own; particularly in the
days of Hezekiah, which may be here respected, the people retained and
practised the true worship and service of God: which, as it is the
truest liberty, so is the highest honour and dignity: such are rulers
with God, as all the Lord's people, all that believe in Christ, are;
they are made by his grace kings and princes; and they appear to be so
by their new birth; they are clothed, fed, and guarded as princes, as
the sons of a king, as kings themselves; they have the riches and power
of kings; they are possessed of a kingdom of grace now, which is within
them, and where grace reigns, through righteousness, over their lusts
and corruptions; and great power, like princes, have they in prayer with
God, and are heirs of the kingdom of glory, as well as shall reign with
Christ on earth. Gussetius renders it, "Judah yet weeps with God": as
his father Jacob did, imitating him, as in [Hos
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#004.md);

and is faithful with the saints; which Kimchi's father interprets of God
himself; and so Lyra, and according to him Jarchi: and then the sense
is, "and he", that is, God, "is faithful with the saints"; in fulfilling
all his counsels, purposes, and designs of grace concerning them; in
making good his covenant with them, and his promises unto them; and by
bringing them to the enjoyment of all that grace and glory he calls them
to: but this is rather an epithet of Judah, who kept to the word and
worship of the true God, as the saints of old, their ancestors, had
done; walked in the good old way, in the way of good men, and kept the
paths of the righteous; abode by the true priests of the Lord, who were
set apart and sanctified for that office; and hearkened to the prophets,
the holy men of God, who spake to them, being moved by the Holy Spirit:
and adhered firmly "to the holy things" (p), as it may be rendered; to
the holy temple, and the worship in it; to the holy sacrifices, altars,
&c. when the ten tribes departed from them: and so this may be applied
to the faithful in Christ Jesus, that believe in him truly, and continue
in the faith of him in all ages; and who are "faithful with the Holy
Ones" (q); the same with God in the former clause; so Kimchi interprets
it, and so the word is used in [Pro
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#010.md); see [Jos
24:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#019.md); that is, with Father, Son, and
Spirit; with the Father, when they worship him in spirit and truth; with
the Son, when they cleave to him with full purpose of heart; with the
Spirit, when they walk after him, and give to each the glory due unto
them: or rather, "faithful with holy men" (r); sanctified by the Spirit
and grace of God; as they are, when they hold fast the faith delivered
to the saints without mixture or wavering, with courage and manliness;
though the greater number is against them, and they are reproached and
persecuted for so doing; when they abide by the ordinances of Christ, as
they were delivered, and keep them in faith and love, without sinister
views; when they continue steadfastly in the communion of the saints,
attending with them on the word and ordinances, and do not forsake their
assembling together; and when they constantly exhort and stir up one
another to the duties of religion, and faithfully admonish and reprove
each other as there is occasion for it.
