INTRODUCTION TO JOEL

In some Hebrew Bibles this prophecy is called "Sepher Joel", the Book of
Joel; in the Vulgate Latin version, the Prophecy of Joel; and in the
Syriac version, the Prophecy of the Prophet Joel; and the Arabic
version, the Prophet Joel; and so the Apostle Peter quotes him, [Act
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#016.md). His name, according to Hillerus
(a), signifies "the Lord is God"; but others derive it from lay, which
in "Hiphil" is lyawh, and signifies "he willed, acquiesced, or is well
pleased, so Abarbinei; and hence Schmidt thinks it answers to Desiderius
or Erasmus. According to Isidorus (b), he was born at Bethoron, in the
tribe of Reuben, and died and was buried there; and so says
Pseudo-Epiphanius (c). In what age he lived is not easy to say. Aben
Ezra expressly affirms there is no way to know it; and so R. David Ganz
(d) says, his time we know not; and likewise Abarbinel. Some think he
prophesied about the same time Hoses did, after whom he is next placed;
and so Mr. Whiston (e) and, Mr. Bedford (f) make him to prophesy much
about the same time with Isaiah and Hoses, about eight hundred years
before Christ; but, in the Septuagint version, this book is in the
fourth order, and not Hoses, but Amos and Micah, are placed before him;
and so the author of Juchasin (g) puts the prophets in this order, first
Hoses, then Amos, next Isaiah, then Micah, and after him Joel. Some of
the Jewish writers, as Jarchi, Kimchi, and Abendana relate, make Joel
contemporary with Elisha, and say he prophesied in the, lays of Jehoram
the son of Ahab, when the seven years' famine called for came upon the
land, [Kg2 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#001.md). Both in Seder Olam
Rabba and Zuta (h) he is placed in the reign of Manasseh; and so in
Hilchot Gedolot, as Jarchi observes. And it seems indeed as if he
prophesied after the ten tribes were carried captive, which was in the
sixth year of Hezekiah's reign, since no mention is made of Israel but
with respect to future times, only of Judah and Jerusalem, But, be it
when it will that he prophesied, there is no doubt to be made of the
authenticity of this book, which is confirmed by the quotations of two
apostles out of two: Peter and Paul, [Act
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#016.md).
