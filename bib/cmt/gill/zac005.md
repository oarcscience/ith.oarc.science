INTRODUCTION TO ZECHARIAH 5

This chapter treats of the judgments of God upon the wicked Jews for
their sins and impieties, the measure of which was filled up, and of the
execution of them, which are represented in two visions: the first is of
a flying roll, which signifies the curse of God, and is described by its
measure, the length being twenty cubits, and the breadth ten; and by the
extent of it, it reaching to the whole earth, and particularly to
thieves and false swearers, who shall be cut off by it; and by the
certainty of its coming into the houses of such, and the utter
desolation it should there make, [Zac
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#001.md) and the other is the vision of an
ephah, and a woman sitting in it, and a talent of lead cast upon the
mouth of it, which signified wickedness, [Zac
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#005.md) this "ephah" is seen to be lifted
up between earth and heaven by two women, who are said to have wings
like the wings of storks, and the wind to be in them; and who are said
by the angel to carry the "ephah" into the land of Shinar, to build it a
house, that it might be established and settled upon its own base, [Zac
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#009.md).

[Zechariah 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 5:1</span></span>

Then I turned, and lift up mine eyes, and looked,.... The prophet turned
himself from looking upon the candlestick and olive branches, having had
a full and clear understanding of them, and looked another way, and saw
another vision:

and behold a flying roll, a volume or book flying in the air; it being
usual for books, which were written on parchment, to be rolled up in the
form of a cylinder; whence they were called rolls or volumes.

[Zechariah 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 5:2</span></span>

And he said unto me,.... That is, the angel:

What seest thou? and I answered, I see a flying roll, the length whereof
is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits; so that it was a
very large one, a volume of a very uncommon size, especially it may so
seem to us; but in other nations they have very long rolls or volumes,
even longer than this: the Russians write their acts, protests, and
other court matters, on long rolls of paper, some twenty ells, some
thirty, and some sixty, and more (x): and this being the length and
breadth of the porch before the temple, [Kg1
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#003.md) hence the Jewish writers conclude
that this flying roll came from thence: it may design either the roll or
book in which the sins of men are written; which is very large, and will
quickly be brought into judgment, when it will be opened, and men will
be judged according to it; which shows the notice God takes of the sins
of men; the exact knowledge he has of them; his strict remembrance of
them; and the certain account men must give of them another day: or, the
book of God's judgments upon sinners, such as was Ezekiel's roll, [Eze
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#009.md) which are many and great; are
rolled up, and not at present to be searched into; but are flying,
coming on, and will be speedily executed: or rather the book of the law,
called a roll or volume, [Psa 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007.md) and
which will be a swift witness against the breakers of it, as more fully
appears from the explanation of it in the next verse [Zac
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#003.md). It is a mere fancy and conceit of
some that the Talmud is meant by this roll, the body of the Jewish
traditions, which make void the commands of God, take away the blessing,
and leave a curse in the land, as they did in the land of Judea.

[Zechariah 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zac 5:3</span></span>

Then said he unto me, This is the curse,.... So the law of Moses is
called, because it has curses written in it, [Deu
27:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#015.md) which curse is not causeless,
but is according to law and justice; it is from the Lord, and is no
other than the wrath of the Almighty; and, wherever it lights, it will
remain and continue for ever. Vitringa, on [Isa
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#006.md) says, this is the curse which
Isaiah there prophesies of, which had its accomplishment in the times of
Antiochus; but there the prophet is speaking, not of the land of Judea,
but of the antichristian states.

That goeth forth over the face of the whole earth: over the whole land
of Judea, and the inhabitants of it, for their breach of the law,
contempt of the Gospel, and the rejection of the Messiah; and which had
its accomplishment when wrath came upon them to the uttermost, in the
destruction of their nation, city, and temple; and is the curse God
threatened to smite their land with, [Mal
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#006.md) and this curse also reaches to the
whole world, and the inhabitants of it, who lie in wickedness; and to
all sorts of sinners, particularly those next mentioned:

for everyone that stealeth shall be cut off as on this side, according
to it; as it is written and declared on one side of the roll:

and everyone that sweareth shall be cut off as on that side according to
it; as is written and declared on the other side of the roll; which two
sins of theft and false swearing, the one being against the second, and
the other the first table of the law, show that the curse of the law
reaches to all sorts of sins and sinners; to all who do not keep it in
every respect: and, indeed, to all but those who are redeemed from it by
the blood of Christ; and that it is proportioned according to a man's
sins: and those two are particularly mentioned, because they are sins
which prevailed among the Jews at the time Christ was on earth. Theft
did, both in a literal and figurative sense, [Mat
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#014.md) and so did vain swearing, [Mat
5:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#033.md).

[Zechariah 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zac 5:4</span></span>

I will bring it forth, saith the Lord of hosts,.... The roll was come
forth, and was flying abroad; but the curse and wrath of God, signified
by it, is what God would bring forth out of his treasures, according to
his purposes and declarations, and execute upon sinners; which shows the
certainty of it, and that there is no escaping it:

and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of
him that sweareth falsely by my name; and it shall remain in the midst
of his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof, and the
stones thereof; when wrath is gone forth from the Lord, there is no
stopping it; and where it takes place it will remain, there is no
getting rid of it; it makes an utter desolation of goods and estates,
and entirely destroys both body and soul in hell: there seems to be an
allusion to the plague of the leprosy, [Lev
14:45](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#045.md). So the son of Sirach says,

"a man that swears much shall be full of iniquity, and the plague shall
not depart from his house:''

and again,

"if a man swears in vain, he shall not be innocent or justified, for his
house shall be full of calamities (y).''

So the oracle in Herodotus (z), which Grotius has observed, makes an
utter destruction of a man's house and family, to be the punishment of
the sin of perjury. Moreover, by the house of the thief and swearer may
be meant the temple, as in the times of Christ, which was become a den
of thieves and perjurers, and for their sins, became desolate, [Mat
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#013.md).

[Zechariah 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zac 5:5</span></span>

Then the angel that talked with me went forth,.... From the place where
he was, and had been interpreting the vision of the flying roll, unto
another more convenient for showing and explaining the following one;
and, as it should seem, took the prophet along with him:

and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what is this that
goeth forth; either out of the temple or out of heaven, into some open
place, where it might be seen.

[Zechariah 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 5:6</span></span>

And I said, What is it?.... After he had lifted up his eyes and seen it,
he desires to know both what it was, and what was the meaning of it:

and he said, This is an ephah that goeth forth; which was a measure much
in use with the Jews, [Exo 16:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#036.md) it is
the same with the "bath", and held above seven wine gallons. The Targum
interprets this of such who dealt in false measures, whose sin is
exposed, and their punishment set forth; but rather it designs the
measure of iniquity filling up, either in Judea, particularly in the
times of Christ, [Mat 23:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#032.md) or in the
whole world, and especially in the antichristian states, [Rev
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#005.md), and

He said moreover, this is their resemblance through all the earth; or
"this is their eye" (z); what they are looking at, and intent upon,
namely, this ephah; that is, to fill up the measure of their iniquity:
or, as Kimchi and Ben Melech interpret it, this ephah, which thou seest,
shows that there is an eye upon them which sees their works; and this is
the eye of the Lord, which sees and takes notice of all the evil actions
of men, not as approving them, but as observing them, and avenging them.
Cocceius, by the "ephah", understands an abundance of temporal good
things bestowed upon the Christian church in Constantine's time and
following, on which the eyes of carnal men were looking.

[Zechariah 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 5:7</span></span>

And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead,.... By the angel;
since he is afterwards said to cast it upon the mouth of the "ephah". A
cicar, or talent of silver, with the Jews, was equal to three thousand
shekels, as may be gathered from [Exo
38:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#024.md) and weighed a hundred and twenty
five pounds (a); or, as others, a hundred and twenty (b), and, according
to the more exact account of Dr. Arbuthnot, a hundred and thirteen
pounds, ten ounces, one pennyweight, and ten and two seventh grains of
our Troy weight. A Babylonish talent, according to Aelianus (c), weighed
seventy two Attic pounds; and an Attic mina, or pound, weighed a hundred
drachmas; so that it was of the weight of seven thousand two hundred
such drachmas. An Alexandrian talent was equal to twelve thousand Attic
drachmas; and these the same with a hundred and twenty five Roman libras
or pounds; which talent is supposed to be the same with that of Moses.
The Roman talent contained seventy two Italic minas, which were the same
with the Roman libras (d). But since the Hebrew word "cicar" signifies
anything plain, and what is extended like a cake, as Arias Montanus
observes (e), it may here intend a plate of lead, which was laid over
the mouth of the "ephah", as a lid unto it; though indeed it is
afterwards called , "a stone of lead", and so seems to design a weight.

And this is a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah; who, in [Zac
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#008.md), is called "wickedness"; and here
represented by a "woman", because, say some, the woman was first in the
transgression; or rather because sin is flattering and deceitful, and
draws into the commission of it, and so to ruin: and this woman,
wickedness, intends wicked men; all the wicked among the Jews, and even
all the wicked of the world; who sit in the "ephah", very active and
busy in filling up the measure of their sins, and where they sit with
great pleasure and delight; very openly and visibly declare their sin,
as Sodom, and hide it not; in a very proud and haughty manner, with
great boldness and impudence, and in great security, without any concern
about a future state, promising themselves impunity here and hereafter.
This woman is a very lively emblem of the whore of Rome, sitting as a
queen upon many waters; ruling over kings and princes; living
deliciously, and in great ease and pleasure filling up the measure of
her sins. Kimchi interprets this woman of the ten tribes, who wickedly
departed from God, and were as one kingdom.

[Zechariah 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zac 5:8</span></span>

And he said, This is wickedness,.... A representation of wicked men, who
are wickedness itself, as their inward part is, [Psa
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#009.md) and particularly of the wicked
one, the man of sin and son of perdition, the Roman antichrist and
apocalyptic beast; who, though he is called by this title, "his
Holiness", his true and proper name is "wickedness"; , that wicked
lawless one, [Th2 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008.md) yea, wickedness
itself, being extremely wicked, a sink of sin and of all abominations,
[Rev 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#005.md).

And he cast it into the midst of the ephah; that is, wickedness; that it
might be kept within bounds, and not exceed its measure to be filled up:
this seems to denote some restraint on sinners, that they may not be
able to go all the lengths they would; and some rebuke upon them, that
they might not lift up their heads with impunity; and some check upon
them, and their furious rage towards the people of God; and also the
putting of an utter end to sin and sinners, and particularly the
followers of antichrist; see [Psa
104:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#035.md).

And he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof; either upon the
mouth of the woman, or of the ephah; and, be it which it will, it was
done to keep the woman within the ephah, and press her down there; and
intends the judgments of God upon sinners; and shows that there is no
escaping divine vengeance; that it falls heavy where it lights, and
sinks to the lowest hell; and that it will continue, being laid on by
the firm, unchangeable, and irrevocable decree of God. Cocceius
understands this of the Saracens and Turks, and the barbarous nations,
being cast into the Roman empire, to restrain the antichristian tyranny;
but it seems better to apply it to the utter destruction of antichrist,
signified by a millstone cast into the sea and sunk there, never to rise
more; see [Rev 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#021.md) and with it
compare [Exo 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#010.md).

[Zechariah 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zac 5:9</span></span>

Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked,.... This is not a new vision,
but a continuation of the former, as appears from the "ephah" seen in
it:

and, behold, there came out two women; out of the same place the "ephah"
did. The Targum explains these "two women" by two provinces; and Kimchi
interprets them of the two tribes of Judah and Benjamin, who had been
carried captive into Babylon; and others of the two kings, Jehoiakim and
Zedekiah, who were the cause of the captivity; but Jarchi understands by
them the Babylonians and Chaldeans, two nations as one, joined in
Nebuchadnezzar's armies, which carried them captive: others think the
two reformers, Ezra and Nehemiah, are meant, who were instruments of
purging the Jews, returned from captivity, though but weak ones, and
therefore are compared to "women"; yet what they did they did swiftly,
and therefore are said to have "wings", and under the influence of the
Spirit of God; hence the "wind", or "spirit" (f), is said to be in their
wings; and they acted from a tender regard to the glory of God and the
good of their country; and therefore their wings were like the "wings of
a stork"; a bird of passage, as appears from [Jer
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#007.md) and so a fit emblem to be used in
the transportation of the "ephah"; of whom Pliny (g) says, from whence
they come, and whither they betake themselves, is yet unknown; and adds,
there is no doubt that they come from afar; as it is plain they must, if
that relation be true, which seems to have good authority, that one of
these creatures, upon its return to Germany, brought a green root of
ginger with it; which must come from the eastern part of the world; from
Arabia, or Ethiopia, or the East Indies, where it grows (h): and as it
is a bird that takes such long flights, it must have wings fitted for
such a purpose; and which are taken notice of in [Job
39:13](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#013.md) to which the wings and feather
of the ostrich are compared; for so Bochart (i) there renders the word,
"the wing of the ostriches rejoices, truly the wing" as of "a stork, and
the feather"; or, as others, "who gave wings to the stork and ostrich?"
both remarkable for their wings: and Vatablus renders the word here an
"ostrich"; which, according to Pliny (k), is the largest of birds, and
almost as big as a beast. In Ethiopia and Africa they are taller than a
horse and his rider, and exceed the horse in swiftness; and their wings
seem to be given them to help them in running; but which are not
sufficient to lift them much above the earth, and so can not be meant
here; but rather the stork, whose wings are black and white; and when
they fly, they stretch out their necks forwards, and their feet
backwards, and with these direct their course; when a tempest rises,
standing on both feet, they spread their wings, lay their bill upon
their breast, and turn their face that way the storm comes (l). The
Targum renders it an eagle, which is the swiftest of birds, and whose
wings are very strong to bear anything upon them, as they do their
young, to which the allusion is, [Deu
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#011.md) and so, if meant here, to lift
up and bear away the ephah between the earth and the heaven; but the
word is never used of that bird. The Harpies or Furies, with the
Heathens, are represented, as women having wings (m) as these women are
said to have; but these are very different women from them. Though some
think the Romans, under Vespasian and Titus, are intended; but it may be
that the two, perfections of God, his power and justice, in punishing
men for their sins, are meant, particularly in the last times, and at
the day of judgment. The power of God will be seen in raising the dead;
in bringing all to judgment; in separating the wicked from the
righteous, and in the execution of the sentence denounced on them: and
the justice of God will be very conspicuous in the judgment and
destruction of them.

And the wind was in their wings; they had wings, as denoting swiftness,
as angels are said to have; hence Maimonides, as Kimchi observes,
thought that angels are here meant; but this denotes, that though God is
longsuffering, and may seem to defer judgment, which is sometimes a
stumbling to the righteous, and a hardening to the wicked; yet, as this
is only for the salvation of his elect, so when once the time is up, and
the commission given forth, power and justice will speedily execute the
sentence: and the "wind" being in their wings shows the greater
swiftness and speed in the dispatch of business, and the great strength
and force with which they performed it:

for they had wings like the wings of a stork; which, being a creature
kind and tender, show that there is no cruelty in the displays of the
power and justice of God in punishing sinners:

and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven; which
denotes the visibility of the whole measure of the sins of wicked men;
they will all be made manifest, and brought into judgment: and also the
visibility of their punishment; they will go into everlasting
punishment, in the sight of angels and men; and which will be the case
of the antichristian beast, [Rev 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#008.md).

Then said I to the angel that talked with me;.... This the prophet said
after he had seen the "ephah" come forth; the woman, wickedness, cast
into it, and the talent of lead upon her; and the two women lifting up
the ephah between heaven and earth:

Whither do these bear the ephah? he neither asks what the ephah
signified, nor who were the women that bore it, but only whither they
bore it.

[Zechariah 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zac 5:11</span></span>

And he said unto me, To build it an house in the land of Shinar,....
That is, in the province of Babylon, as the Targum paraphrases it; for
Babel, or Babylon, was in the land of Shinar, [Gen
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#010.md) whither the Jews were carried
captive, [Dan 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#002.md) [Isa
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011.md), and the bearing of the "ephah"
thither may denote the cause of their captivity, the measure of sins
filled up by them: though this some understand of the like injuries,
oppressions, and vexations, brought upon the Chaldeans in the land of
Shinar, which they before exercised towards and upon the Jews; and
others of the rejection of wicked men from among the Jews, by Ezra and
Nehemiah, transporting them as it were back to Babylon again: others of
the dispersion of the Jews by the Romans, who chiefly settled after that
in the eastern parts of the world; though indeed the whole world was a
land of Shinar, or "shaking out" (n) unto them; they being shook out of
their own land, and scattered about everywhere; which dispersion has
been long and lasting, notorious and conspicuous; and they are now
settled upon their own base, established upon their former principles of
legality and self-righteousness, and rejection of the true Messiah; or
rather this may be understood of the transfer of the ephah, or whole
measure of iniquity, into mystical Babylon. The antichristian church of
Rome is called Babylon; she is represented as a sink of sin, a mystery
of iniquity, [Rev 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#005.md) and a house
being built for this man of sin, antichrist, denotes the continuance of
him; and being established on its own base, shows the false foundation
on which the church of Rome is built, and her carnal security. So
Cocceius, by the "two women", understands the two kingdoms or powers of
antichrist, the civil and ecclesiastical powers; which support the man
of sin, lift him up, and give him the highest place in the church, and
fix his seat where idolatry and persecution reign, as formerly did in
Babylon, in the land of Shinar. Though the whole may very well be
applied to the last and everlasting punishment of sin and sinners, when
the whole measure is filled up. The end of sin and sinners is death and
everlasting destruction. The ephah, and the woman in it, are carried,
not upwards to heaven, nor to the New Jerusalem, but to the land of
Shinar, the land of shaking; to hell, where are utter darkness, weeping,
wailing, and gnashing of teeth; where a house is built for them, which
denotes their continuance there; and which, being established on its own
base, shows their punishment shall forever remain; their worm never
dies; their fire is not quenched; the smoke of it ascends for ever and
ever; their destruction is an everlasting destruction.
