INTRODUCTION TO PSALM 51

To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came
unto him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba. The occasion of this psalm
was the sin of David with Bathsheba, signified by "going in to her"; an
euphemism for "lying with her"; which sin was a very aggravated one, she
being another man's wife, and the wife of a servant and soldier of his,
who was at the same time exposing his life for his king and country's
good; and David besides had many wives, and was also king of Israel, and
should have set a better example to his subjects; and it was followed
with other sins, as the murder of Uriah, and the death of several
others; with scandal to religion, and with security and impenitence in
him for a long time, until Nathan the prophet was sent to him of God, to
awaken him to a sense of his sin; which he immediately acknowledged, and
showed true repentance for it: upon which, either while Nathan was
present, or after he was gone, he penned this psalm; that it might
remain on record, as a testification of his repentance, and for the
instruction of such as should fall into sin, how to behave, where to
apply, and for their comfort. The history of all this may be seen in the
eleventh and twelfth chapters of the second book of Samuel.

[Psalms 51:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 51:1</span></span>

Have mercy upon me, O God,.... David, under a sense of sin, does not run
away from God, but applies unto him, and casts himself at his feet, and
upon his mercy; which shows the view he had of his miserable condition,
and that he saw there was mercy in God, which gave him hope; and upon
his bended knees, and in the exercise of faith, he asks for it;

according to thy lovingkindness; not according to his merits, nor
according to the general mercy of God, which carnal men rely upon; but
according to his everlasting and unchangeable love in Christ; from which
as the source, and through whom as the medium, special mercy comes to
the children of men. The acts of special mercy are according to the
sovereign will of God: he is not moved to mercy neither by the merits
nor misery of men, but by his free grace and favour; it is love that
sets mercy to work: this is a most glaring gleam of Gospel light, which
none of the inspired writers besides, except the Apostle Paul, saw, [Eph
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#004.md);

according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my
transgressions; for his sin was complicated, attended with many others;
and, besides, upon a view of this, he was led to observe all his other
sins; and particularly the corruption of his nature, his original sin,
which he mentions, [Psa 51:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#005.md). These he
desires might be "blotted out"; out of the book of account, out of God's
debt book; that they might not stand against him, being debts he was not
able to pay or make satisfaction for; and out of the table of his own
heart and conscience, where they were ever before him, and seemed to be
engraven; that they might be caused to pass from him, and he might have
no more conscience of them; or that they might be blotted out, as a
cloud by the clear shining of the sun of righteousness, with the healing
of pardoning grace in his wings; or that they might be wiped away, as
any faith is wiped from any person or thing: and all this "according to
the multitude of his tender mercies". The mercy of God is plenteous and
abundant; he is rich in it, and various are the instances of it; and it
is exceeding tender, like that of a father to his children, or like that
of a mother to the son of her womb; and from this abundant and tender
mercy springs the forgiveness of sin, [Luk
1:77](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#077.md). The psalmist makes mention of
the multitude of the mercies of God, because of the multitude of his
sins, which required a multitude of mercy to forgive, and to encourage
his hope of it.

[Psalms 51:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 51:2</span></span>

Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity,.... Which supposes defilement by
sin, and that very great, and such as none can remove but the Lord
himself; who, when he takes it in hand, does it effectually and
thoroughly; see [Eze 36:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#025.md). David's
sin had long lain upon him, the faith of it had as it were eaten into
him, and spread itself over him, and therefore he needed much washing:
"wash me much", all over, and thoroughly:

and cleanse me from my sin: which only the blood of Christ can do, [Jo1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007.md). The psalmist makes use of three
words to express his sin by, in this verse [Psa
51:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#001.md); which signifies "rebellion", as
all sin has in it rebellion against God the lawgiver, and a contempt of
his commandments; "perverseness", "crookedness", sin being a going out
of the plain way of God's righteous law; and "a missing the mark"; going
besides it or not coming up to it: and these he makes rise of to set
forth the malignity of sin, and the deep sense he had of the exceeding
sinfulness of it; and these are the three words used by the Lord in [Exo
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#007.md); when he declares himself to be a
sin forgiving God; so that David's sin came within the reach of
pardoning mercy.

[Psalms 51:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 51:3</span></span>

For I acknowledge my transgressions,.... Before God and man.
Acknowledgment of sin is what the Lord requires, and promises
forgiveness upon, and therefore is used here as a plea for it; and
moreover the psalmist had done so before, and had succeeded in this way,
which must encourage him to take the same course again; see [Psa
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#005.md);

and my sin is ever before me; staring him in the face; gnawing upon his
conscience, and filling him with remorse and distress; so that his life
was a burden to him: for though God had put away sin out of his own
sight, so that he would not condemn him for it, and he should not die;
notwithstanding as yet it was not caused to pass from David, or the
guilt of it removed from his conscience.

[Psalms 51:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 51:4</span></span>

Against thee, thee only, have I sinned,.... All sin, though committed
against a fellow creature, being a transgression of the law, is against
the lawgiver; and, indeed, begins at the neglect or contempt of his
commandment, as David's sin did, [Sa2
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#009.md); and being committed against God,
that had bestowed so many favours upon him, was a cutting consideration
to him, which made his sorrow appear to be of a godly sort; wherefore he
makes his humble and hearty confession to the Lord, and who only could
forgive his sin;

and done this evil in thy sight; for with respect to men it was secretly
done; and was only known to God, with whom the darkness and the light
are both alike;

that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when
thou judgest; not that David committed this sin that God might be just,
and pure, and holy; but this was the event and consequence of it: God,
by taking notice of it, resenting it, and reproving for it, appeared to
be a righteous Being, and of purer eyes than to behold sin with
pleasure; see [Exo 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#027.md). Or these
words may be connected with his acknowledgment and confession of sin;
which were done to this end and purpose, to justify God in his charge of
it upon him, and in threatening him with evils on account of it, by the
mouth of Nathan the prophet: or with his petitions for pardoning grace
and mercy; that so he might appear to be just to his promise, of
forgiving iniquity, transgression and sin, to humble penitents; and
particularly that he might appear to be just and faithful to his Son, in
forgiving sin for his sake; whom he had set forth, in his purposes and
promises, to be the propitiation for sin, to declare his righteousness,
[Rom 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025.md); see [Rom
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#004.md).

[Psalms 51:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 51:5</span></span>

Behold, I was shapen in iniquity,.... This cannot be understood of any
personal iniquity of his immediate parents; since this respects his
wonderful formation in the womb, in which both he and they were wholly
passive, as the word here used is of that form; and is the amazing work
of God himself, so much admired by the psalmist, [Psa
139:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#013.md); and cannot design any
sinfulness then infused into him by his Maker, seeing God cannot be the
author of sin; but of original sin and corruption, derived to him by
natural generation: and the sense is, that as soon as ever the mass of
human nature was shaped and quickened, or as soon as soul and body were
united together, sin was in him, and he was in sin, or became a sinful
creature;

and in sin did my mother conceive me; by whom cannot be meant Eve; for
though she is the mother of all living, and so of David, yet could not,
with any propriety, be said to conceive him: this only could be said of
his immediate parent, not even of his next grandmother, much less of
Eve, at the distance of almost three thousand years. Nor does the sin in
which he was conceived intend any sin of his parents, in begetting and
conceiving him, being in lawful wedlock; which acts cannot be sinful,
since the propagation of the human species by natural generation is a
principle of nature implanted by God himself; and is agreeably to the
first law of nature, given to man in a state of innocence, "increase and
multiply", [Gen 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#028.md). Marriage is the
institution of God in paradise; and in all ages has been accounted
"honourable in all, when the bed is undefiled", [Heb
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#004.md). Nor does it design his being
conceived when his mother was in "profluviis", of which there is no
proof, and is a mere imagination, and can answer no purpose; much less
that he was conceived in adultery, as the contenders for the purity of
human nature broadly intimate; which shows how much they are convicted
by this text, to give into such an interpretation of it, at the expense
of the character of an innocent person, of whom there is not the least
suggestion of this kind in the Holy Scriptures; but on the contrary, she
is represented as a religious woman, and David valued himself upon his
relation to her as such, [Psa 86:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#016.md).
Besides, had this been the case, as David would have been a bastard, he
would not have been suffered to enter into the congregation of the Lord,
according to the law in [Deu 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#002.md);
whereas he often did with great delight, [Psa
42:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#004.md). Moreover, it is beside his scope
and design to expose the sins of others, much less his own parents,
while he is confessing and lamenting his own iniquities: and to what
purpose should he mention theirs, especially if he himself was not
affected by them, and did not derive a corrupt nature from them? Nor is
the sin he speaks of any actual sin of his own, and therefore he does
not call it, as before, "my" iniquity and "my" sin; though it was so, he
having sinned in Adam, and this being in his nature; but "iniquity" and
"sin", it being common to him with all mankind. Hence we learn the
earliness of the corruption of nature; it is as soon as man is conceived
and shapen; and that it is propagated from one to another by natural
generation; and that it is the case of all men: for if this was the case
of David, who was born of religious parents, was famous for his early
piety, and from whose seed the Messiah sprung, it may well be concluded
to be the case of all. And this corruption of nature is the fountain,
source, and spring of all sin, secret and open, private and public; and
is mentioned here not as an extenuation of David's actual
transgressions, but as an aggravation of them; he having been, from his
conception and formation, nothing else but a mass of sin, a lump of
iniquity; and, in his evangelical repentance for them, he is led to take
notice of and mourn over the corruption of his nature, from whence they
arose. The Heathens themselves affirm, that no man is born without sin
(c).

[Psalms 51:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 51:6</span></span>

Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts,.... With delight and
pleasure, as the word (d) signifies: meaning either Christ, the truth
and the life, formed and dwelling in the hearts of his people; or the
Gospel, the word of truth, which has a place there; and particularly
that branch of it which proclaims pardon to sensible sinners, and is the
ground of hope within them: or else a true and hearty confession of sin,
which David now made; or rather internal holiness and purity of heart,
in opposition to the corruption of nature before acknowledged: this is
what is agreeable to the nature of God, is required by his holy law, and
is wrought in the hearts of his people in regeneration; and this is
"truth", real, and not imaginary, genuine and unfeigned; where it is
there is a true sense of sin, a right sight of Christ, unfeigned faith
in him, sincere love to him, hope in him without hypocrisy, and a
reverential fear of God upon the heart; the inward parts are the seat of
all this, and in the exercise of it the Lord takes great delight and
pleasure;

and in the hidden part thou shall make me to know wisdom; either Christ,
the wisdom of God; or the Gospel, and particularly that part of it which
concerns the pardon of sin; or a true knowledge of sin, and of the way
of life and salvation by Christ, which is the truest and highest wisdom:
and the phrase "hidden" or "secret" may either denote the nature of the
wisdom made known, which is hidden wisdom, the wisdom of God in a
mystery; or the manner in which it is made known; it is in a hidden way,
privately, and secretly, and indiscernibly like the wind, by the Spirit
and grace of God; or the seat and subject of it, "the hidden part", as
we supply it; the hidden man of the heart. David begins to rise in the
exercise of his faith in the grace of God, "thou shall make me to know",
&c. unless the words should be rendered as a prayer, as they are by
some, "make me to know" (e), &c. and as are the following.

[Psalms 51:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 51:7</span></span>

Purge me with hyssop,.... Or "thou shalt purge me with hyssop" (f); or
"expiate me"; which was used in sprinkling the blood of the paschal lamb
on the door posts of the Israelites in Egypt, that the destroying angel
might pass over them, [Exo 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#022.md); and
in the cleansing of the leper, [Lev
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#004.md); and in the purification of one
that was unclean by the touch of a dead body, &c. [Num
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#006.md); which the Targum on the text has
respect to; and this petition of the psalmist shows that he saw himself
a guilty creature, and in danger of the destroying angel, and a filthy
creature like the leper, and deserving to be excluded from the society
of the saints, and the house of God; and that he had respect not hereby
to ceremonial sprinklings and purifications, for them he would have
applied to a priest; but to the sprinkling of the blood of Christ,
typified thereby; and therefore he applies to God to purge his
conscience with it; and, as Suidas (g) from Theodoret observes, hyssop
did not procure remission of sins, but has a mystical signification, and
refers to what was meant by the sprinkling of the blood of the passover;
and then he says,

and I shall be clean; thoroughly clean; for the blood sprinkled on the
heart by the spirit clears it from an evil conscience, purges the
conscience from dead works, and cleanses from all sin;

wash me; or "thou shall wash me" (h); alluding to the washing at the
cleansing of a leper, and the purification of an unclean person, [Lev
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#008.md); but had in view the fountain of
Christ's blood, in which believers are washed from all their sins, [Zac
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#001.md);

and I shall be whiter than snow; who was black with original corruption,
and actual transgressions; but the blood of Christ makes not only the
conversation garments white that are washed in it; but even crimson and
scarlet sins as white as wool, as white as snow, and the persons of the
saints without spot or blemish, [Rev
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#014.md), [Eph
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025.md); "whiter than the snow" is a
phrase used by Homer (i), and others, to describe what is exceeding
white.

[Psalms 51:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 51:8</span></span>

Make me to hear joy and gladness,.... Which he had not heard for some
time; sin had sadly broke in upon and interrupted his spiritual peace
and joy; for though the love and favour of God cannot be lost, yet his
sensible presence, which puts joy and gladness into the heart, may; and
though an interest in Christ ever continues, and union to him is always
the same; yet a view of interest in him, which fills with joy
unspeakable and full of glory, and communion with him, may not be had
for a time: and though justification by his righteousness, from whence
flows much peace, is an invariable blessing; yet the comfortable
perception of it may be taken away: and though salvation by Christ is a
certain thing, yet the joy of it may be lost for a season; which was now
the case of the psalmist: and when he desires that God would cause him
to hear joy and gladness, his meaning is, that he might have that made
known unto him; namely, the forgiveness of his sins, which would give
him joy: not by an articulate voice from heaven, which he did not
expect; nor by an angel from thence, which was not usual; but by the
prophet, who as yet might not have declared to him that God had put away
his sin; or, if he had, he might desire to have it repeated, for his
fuller assurance, and greater joy; or by his Spirit, in an impulse on
his mind, saying to him, thy sins are forgiven thee; which would give
him great joy, fulness of it, even what is inconceivable and
inexpressible, signified by these two words, "joy" and "gladness";

that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice: a backsliding
believer is not only like a bone out of joint, [Gal
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001.md); but his falls are sometimes both
to the bruising of him, and to the breaking of his bones; of which when
he is sensible, the quick sense of his sin is as the pain of a broken
bone; see [Psa 38:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#003.md); and here the
breaking of them is ascribed to God; not that he is the cause or
occasion of falling into sin, which breaks the bones, [Jam
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#013.md); but of afflictions, corrections,
and chastisements for sin, which are sometimes expressed by this phrase,
[Isa 38:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#013.md); and which David was
threatened with, and gave him great uneasiness; and of the menaces and
threatenings of the law, which being let into his conscience, worked
wrath and terror there; and also of that true contrition of heart, and
brokenness of spirit, which the Lord produces, and can only cure, by the
discoveries of pardoning grace; which affects the whole frame of nature,
the report of which makes the bones fat, and all of them to say, who is
a God like unto thee? [Pro 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#030.md).

[Psalms 51:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 51:9</span></span>

Hide thy face from my sins,.... In whose sight they were committed,
being now ashamed of them himself, and ashamed that any should see them,
and especially his God; and being filthy and nauseous, he knew they must
be abominable to him, who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity; and
being breaches of his law, must be offensive to him, and provoke the
eyes of his glory; and were such that he knew would not bear the
examination of justice; and that if God was strict to mark them, he
could not stand before him: moreover, in this petition the psalmist
deprecates a severe chastisement of them, which is sometimes expressed
by setting sins before him, [Psa 90:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#008.md);
and entreats the pardon of them, or oblivion and non-remembrance of
them, that they might be cast behind his back, and into the depths of
the sea;

and blot out all mine iniquities; as in [Psa
51:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#001.md); here repeated, to show his deep
sense of them, and his great importunity for the forgiveness of them;
and adds the word all, including all his other sins, with those he had
lately committed; for he knew that, if anyone, was left unpardoned, he
could never answer for it.

[Psalms 51:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 51:10</span></span>

Create in me a clean heart, O God,.... Which was now defiled with sin,
and of which being convinced, he was led more and more to see the
impurity of his heart and nature, from which all his evil actions
flowed; and being sensible that he could not make his heart clean
himself, and that this was the work of God, and a work which required
creating power, he entreats it of him: for as the first work of
conversion is no other than a creation, or a production of something
new, which was not before; so the restoring of a backslider, as it goes
by the same name, it requires the same power; and as the implantation of
grace at first, and particularly of faith, is a work of almighty power;
so the same power must be put forth to bring it into exercise, after
falls into sin; that it may afresh deal with the heart purifying blood
of Christ, which only can make it clean, and is what is here meant;

and renew a right spirit within me; by which is designed, not the Holy
Spirit of God (k); for he is the renewer; nor the spirit or soul of man
as to its essence; but with respect to the qualities of it; and here it
signifies a renewing of the inward man, or an increase of grace, and
causing it to abound in act and exercise; and intends a spirit of
uprightness and integrity, in opposition to dissimulation and hypocrisy;
a spirit "prepared and ready" (l) to every good work, [Mat
26:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#041); "one firm" (m.md) and unmoved from
obedience to the Lord, by sin, temptations, and snares; a heart fixed,
trusting in the Lord, and comfortably assured of an interest in
pardoning grace and mercy.

[Psalms 51:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 51:11</span></span>

Cast me not away from thy presence,.... As abominable; as a vessel in
which he had no pleasure; with indignation and wrath; as one that is
angry with another, cannot bear him in his sight, but bids him be gone
from him. Nothing is more desirable to a child of God than the presence
of God; and nothing gives him more sensible pain than his absence; and
even to be deprived of or denied the means of enjoying his presence the
word and ordinances, makes them very uneasy: to be utterly, and for ever
deprived of it, is the case of the damned in hell, and is the punishment
of loss they sustain; and, on the other hand, the happiness of the
saints in heaven is to enjoy it without interruption. The people of God
are never cast away from his favour, or out of his heart's love; but
they may for a while be without his gracious presence, or not see his
face, nor have the light of his countenance, nor sensible communion with
him, which is here deprecated. David might call to mind the case of
Cain, [Gen 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#014.md); or rather the more
recent one of Saul, whom the Lord rejected, and from whom he departed
upon his sinning, and which he might fear would be his case, [Sa1
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#015.md);

and take not thy Holy Spirit from me; or "the Spirit of thine holiness";
the third Person in the Trinity; so called, not because this epithet of
"holy" is peculiar to him; for it is used also of the Father, and of the
Son, [Joh 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#011.md); but because he is
equally holy with them, and is the author of holiness in his people,
which is therefore called the sanctification of the Spirit, [Pe1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002.md); and without whom David knew that
purity and holiness of heart and spirit he had desired could not be
renewed and increased in him; and therefore deprecates the taking of him
away; which shows that he was not as yet removed from him, not with
standing he had fallen into great sins; and his sense of sin, and
confession of it, and his fervent application for pardoning grace, and
purity of heart, abundantly prove it. The Spirit of God is a gift of
his, which is without repentance, and where he once is as a spirit of
regeneration and sanctification, he ever abides: his external gifts may
be taken away; but internal grace is an incorruptible seed, and always
continues. By sin the Spirit of God may be grieved, so as to withdraw
his gracious influences, and his powerful operations may not be felt;
and this is what is here deprecated. The Targum interprets this of the
spirit of prophecy which David had, by which he composed psalms and
songs prophetic of Christ, and of Gospel times, and which was not taken
away from him; see [Sa2 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#001.md).

[Psalms 51:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 51:12</span></span>

Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation,.... Not temporal, but
spiritual and eternal; and designs either Christ himself, who is God's
salvation, of his appointing and providing, in the view of whom, as
such, David had much spiritual joy; or the salvation he was to work out,
which God the Father had contrived the scheme of in him, had covenanted
with him to do, and had appointed his people to: salvation itself is a
sure thing, and can never fail, being founded upon the purpose and
counsel of God, which shall ever stand; and is secured in the covenant
of grace, which can never be removed; and is now completely wrought out
by Christ, and is applied by his Spirit to the heirs of it, who shall
certainly and fully enjoy it; otherwise the glory of all the three
Persons in it would be lost: but the joy of it may be interrupted and
discontinued for a while, through falls into sin, as this case of David,
and the case of Peter, show; and therefore a restoration of it is
desired, by showing a fresh interest in this salvation; and particularly
by an application of pardoning grace and mercy; see [Psa
35:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#003.md);

and uphold me with thy free Spirit: or "let thy free Spirit uphold me"
(n); the same with the Holy Spirit of God; called "free", because he is
a most free and munificent giver: he gives his grace, and bestows his
gifts severally, as he pleases, and liberally, and upbraids not; and
because he is freely given of God; his graces are freely given, as
faith, hope, love, &c. and because he frees them to whom he is given
from the bondage of sin and corruption, and makes them Christ's free
men, and delivers them into the liberty of the children of God; and so
is a spirit of adoption, in opposition to a spirit of bondage, by which
they have freedom and boldness to call God their Father; and by whom
also they have liberty of soul at the throne of grace, and can freely
make known their requests, and spread their cases before God; see [Rom
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015.md); also he may be so called,
because he makes the saints ready and willing to obey the will of God,
and to run with cheerfulness the way of his commandments; and is
moreover "a princely spirit" (o), or beneficent, as some choose to
render the words; and which becomes such who are set among princes, and
are made kings and priests unto God: and with this spirit the psalmist
desires to be "upheld", to be strengthened by it, to do the will and
work of God, that so he might not stumble and fall into sin as he had
done; that he might be stayed, supported, and comforted with it, as the
Holy Spirit of promise; that so he might not faint and sink under his
present sense of sin, and the guilt of it; and that he would be not only
a guide unto him in the ways of God, but that he would hold up his
goings in them, that so he might walk both at liberty and in safety. The
Targum interprets this also of the spirit of prophecy.

[Psalms 51:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 51:13</span></span>

Then will I teach transgressors thy ways,.... David was a prophet as
well as a king; see [Act 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#030.md); and
taught men the fear of the Lord, [Psa
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#011.md), and instructed them in his
ways, as he here promises he would; by which are meant, either the ways
which God prescribes and directs men to walk in, as the paths of faith,
holiness, and truth, and the ways of his commandments; or which he
himself has walked in; meaning not the ways of his providence, which are
sometimes past finding out; but the ways of his grace, the steps and
methods he has taken in the salvation of men, by forming the scheme of
it, by choosing unto it, by making a covenant with his Son, and
appointing him to effect it; and particularly his ways and methods in
receiving and pardoning backsliders, when returned by repentance to him;
and who may be meant by "transgressors" here: and then the sense is,
that David, upon his being received and pardoned, would teach others
like himself how graciously God had dealt with him; how plenteous he is
in mercy; how ready to forgive, and how faithful to his promises; and so
encourage them to go to him, and acknowledge their transgressions, and
seek pardoning grace at his hands, who does abundantly pardon, and whose
ways are not as theirs; see [Isa 55:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#007.md);

and sinners shall be converted unto thee: or "that sinners may be
converted unto thee" (p); this being the end of teaching by the word,
and the means of the conversion of profane and unregenerate sinners,
through the power of divine grace; though rather this seems to be
understood of the conversion of God's own people after backslidings, and
not of first conversion; see [Luk
22:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#032.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 51:14</span></span>

Deliver me from blood guiltiness,.... Or "from bloods" (q); meaning not
the corruption of nature; see [Eze
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#006.md); though to be rid of that, and to
be free from the guilt and condemnation of it, is very desirable, [Rom
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#024.md); but either from capital
punishment in his family, the effusion of blood and slaughter in it,
threatened him on account of his sin, [Sa2
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#010.md). So the Targum is,

"deliver me from the judgment of slaying or killing;''

or rather from the guilt of the blood of Uriah, and other servants of
his, he had been the occasion of shedding, and was chargeable with,
being accessary thereunto, [Sa2 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#015.md);
which lay heavy upon his conscience, pressed him on every side, as if he
was in prison, and brought upon him a spirit of bondage to fear; and
therefore he prays to be delivered from it, by the application of
pardoning grace, which would be like proclaiming liberty to the captive;

O God, thou God of my salvation; who has contrived it for his people,
chosen them to it, secured it for them in covenant, and provided his Son
to be the author of it, and sends his Spirit to apply it. The psalmist
knew, that being God he could pardon his sin, remove his guilt, and free
him from obligation to punishment, which none else could; and being the
"God of his salvation", and his covenant God, he had reason to hope and
believe he would;

and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness; goodness, grace,
and mercy, in forgiving sin; for "righteousness" sometimes designs
clemency, goodness, and mercy; see [Psa
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#001.md); and faithfulness in making good
the divine promise to forgive such who are sensible of sin, and repent
of it, acknowledge it, and ask for mercy; or the righteousness of
Christ, well known to David, [Rom 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#006.md);
which justifies from all sin, removes the guilt of it, and fills the
soul with joy and gladness, [Isa
61:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010.md).

[Psalms 51:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 51:15</span></span>

O Lord, open thou my lips,.... The Targum adds, "in the late"; which
were shut with a sense of sin, with shame of it, and sorrow for it; and
though they were in some measure opened in prayer to God for the
forgiveness of it, as appears by various petitions in this psalm, yet he
still wanted a free spirit and boldness at the throne of grace, which
the believer has when his heart is sprinkled from an evil conscience by
the blood of Christ; and especially his lips were shut as to praise and
thanksgiving; the guilt of sin had sealed up his lips, that he could not
sing the praises of God as he had formerly done; and only a discovery of
pardoning grace could open them, and for this he prays:

and my mouth shall show forth thy praise: the praise of his mercy,
grace, goodness, truth, and faithfulness, in psalms, hymns, and
spiritual songs; see [Psa 103:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#001.md).

[Psalms 51:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 51:16</span></span>

For thou desirest not sacrifice,.... Legal sacrifice; for there was no
sacrifice appointed under the law for murder and adultery;

else would I give it; he would gladly have offered it up;

thou delightest not in burnt offering; at least such kind of sacrifices,
though they were of divine appointment, and at that time in full force
and use; yet they were not the only and principal sacrifices God desired
and delighted in; nor were they at all acceptable to him without faith
in Christ, and an humble sense of sin; and when offered in the best
manner, yet spiritual obedience, acts of mercy, and sacrifices of praise
and thanksgiving, were more pleasing to him, [Sa1
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#015.md); wherefore the psalmist proposed
to offer praise in [Psa 51:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#015.md), and
adds what follows.

[Psalms 51:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 51:17</span></span>

The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit,.... That is humbled under a
sense of sin; has true repentance for it; is smitten, wounded, and
broken with it, by the word of God in the hand of the Spirit, which is a
hammer to break the rock in pieces; and that not merely in a legal, but
in an evangelical way; grieving for sin as committed against a God of
love; broken and melted down under a sense of it, in a view of pardoning
grace; and mourning for it, while beholding a pierced and wounded
Saviour: the sacrifices of such a broken heart and contrite spirit are
the sacrifices God desires, approves, accepts of, and delights in;

a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise; but regard,
and receive with pleasure; see [Psa
102:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#017.md); the Lord binds up and heals
such broken hearts and spirits, [Psa
147:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#003.md); he is nigh to such persons,
looks upon them, has respect unto them, and comes and dwells among them,
[Psa 34:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#018.md).

[Psalms 51:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 51:18</span></span>

Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion,.... This verse, and [Psa
51:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#019.md), are thought, by a Spanish Rabbi
mentioned by Aben Ezra, to have been added by one of the holy men that
lived in the time of the Babylonish captivity; though rather it is
thought, by the latter, to be written by David, under a spirit of
prophecy, concerning, times to come; and so Kimchi thinks they are
prophetic of future things; of the destruction of the first and second
temple, and of the acceptableness of sacrifices in the times of the
Messiah: and by Zion is meant the church, under the Gospel dispensation,
[Heb 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022.md); and the "good" prayed for
includes all the good and glorious things spoken of the church of Christ
in the latter day; such as an increase of its numbers, the bringing in
the fulness of the Gentiles, the conversion of the Jews, and the
kingdoms of this world becoming the kingdoms of our Lord and of his
Christ; the spread of the Gospel all over the world, the purity of
Gospel doctrine, worship, and ordinances, the spirituality of religion,
the power of godliness, and an abounding of brotherly love, and the
like. The "good pleasure" of God, in which this is desired to be done,
may denote either , "the acceptable time"; or "time of good pleasure";
the Gospel dispensation, so called [Isa
49:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#008.md), in which it has been foretold,
and may be expected these things shall be done; or else the cause,
source, and spring of them, which is the sovereign good will and
pleasure of God, from whence flow all the blessings of grace and
goodness;

build thou the walls of Jerusalem; not literally taken; for these do not
appear to have stood in need of being repaired or rebuilt in David's
time; but the church of God, which is a spiritual house, built up of
lively stones, true believers; which may be said to be more and more
built up by an addition of such unto it: it is as a city compact
together, whose walls are salvation, and its gates praise, [Isa
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#001.md); of the wall of the new
Jerusalem, see [Rev 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#012.md).

[Psalms 51:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 51:19</span></span>

Then shall thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness,....
Which must be different from the legal ones he desired not, and did not
delight in, [Psa 51:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#016.md); but design
sacrifices under the Gospel dispensation, as the word "then" shows,
which connects this verse with [Psa
51:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#018.md), and in the first place intend
the sacrifice of Christ, which is of a sweet smelling savour to God; and
his righteousness, with which he is well pleased, because the law is
magnified and made honourable by it; and next the saints themselves, who
present their bodies to him a holy, living, and acceptable sacrifice,
they being accepted with him in Christ the beloved; as also their good
works, particularly acts of charity and beneficence, with which
sacrifices God is well pleased; and especially the spiritual sacrifices
of praise and thanksgiving, which are acceptable to him through Jesus
Christ; as all are that are offered in faith through him, and from love,
and with a view to the glory of God; see [Eph
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002.md), [Rom
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001.md);

with burnt offering, and whole burnt offering; the difference between
these two, according to Aben Ezra and Kimchi, was, that the "olah", or
"burnt offering", was the daily sacrifice; and the additional ones,
which were of beasts and birds, [Lev
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md), and the "calil", was the meat
offering of the priests, which was wholly consumed, [Lev
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#022.md); though this also is sometimes
used of beasts, [Sa1 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#009.md); and both may
signify love to God, and to our neighbour; or a man's devoting himself
to the Lord in the flames of love, as a whole burnt offering to him, and
which is better than all burnt offerings, [Mar
12:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#033.md);

then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar; or "calves" (r);
meaning the calves of the lips, [Hos
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#002.md); interpreted the fruit of the
lips, even giving thanks to the name of God, [Heb
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#016.md); which sacrifices of praise
being offered up on the altar Christ, come with acceptance before God,
[Heb 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#010.md).
