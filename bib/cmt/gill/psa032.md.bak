INTRODUCTION TO PSALM 32

A Psalm, of David, Maschil. This is the first of the psalms that bears
this title: some think it is the name of a musical instrument, on which
this psalm was sung; others the first word of a song, to the tune of
which it was sung, as Aben Ezra; some say it is so called, because it
was explained by an interpreter, as Jarchi; and the Rabbins (k) say,
that every psalm that is called "Maschil" was dictated by an
interpreter: the Targum renders it "a good understanding"; and the word
properly signifies "instruction", or "causing to understand" (l); and it
may be the apostle has some reference to this title in [Co1
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#015.md); It is an instructive psalm; a
didascalic ode, as Junius renders it: it gives an account how the
psalmist was instructed under a dispensation of Providence; and was
brought to a sense of sin, and acknowledgment of it; and was favoured
with a discovery of pardoning grace; and in it he takes upon him to
instruct others, [Psa 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#008.md), and does
instruct in the doctrine of the pardon of sin by the grace of God.

[Psalms 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 32:1</span></span>

Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven,.... Or "lifted up" (m);
bore and carried away: sin is a transgression of the law; the guilt of
it charged upon the conscience of a sinner is a heavy burden, too heavy
for him to bear, and the punishment of it is intolerable: forgiveness is
a removal of sin, guilt, and punishment. Sin was first taken off, and
transferred from the sinner to Christ, the surety; and who laid upon him
really and judicially, as the sins of the people of Israel were put upon
the scapegoat typically; and was bore by him, both guilt and punishment,
and taken away, finished, and made an end of; and by the application of
his blood and sacrifice it is taken away from the sinner's conscience;
it is caused to pass from him, and is removed afar off, as far as the
east is from the west; it is so lifted off from him as to give him ease
and peace, and so as never to return to the destruction of him;
wherefore such a man is a happy man; he has much peace, comfort,
calmness, and serenity of mind now can appear before God with
intrepidity, and serve him without fear; no bill of indictment can
hereafter be found against him; no charge will be exhibited, and so no
condemnation to him. The same is expressed, though in different words,
in the next clause;

whose sin is covered; not by himself, by any works of righteousness done
by him; for these are a covering too narrow; nor by excuses and
extenuations; for prosperity and happiness do not attend such a conduct,
[Pro 28:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#013.md); but by Christ; he is the
mercy seat, the covering of the law; who is the covert of his people
from the curses of it, and from the storm of divine wrath and vengeance,
due to the transgressions of it; his blood is the purple covering of the
chariot, under which the saints ride safe to heaven; the lines of his
blood are drawn over crimson and scarlet sins, by which they are blotted
out, and are not legible; and being clothed with the robe of Christ's
righteousness, all their sins are covered from the eye of divine
Justice; not from the eye of God's omniscience, which sees the sins of
all men, and beholds those of his own people; and which he takes notice
of, and corrects for, in a fatherly way; but from vindictive justice,
they are so hid as not to be imputed and charged, nor the saints to be
condemned for them; such are unblamable and unreproveable in the sight
of God, and are all fair in the eyes of Christ; and their sins are
caused to pass away from themselves, and they have no more sight and
conscience of them; and though sought for at the last day, they will not
be found and brought to light, nor be seen by men or angels. There is
something unseemly, impure, nauseous, abominable, and provoking in sin;
which will not bear to be seen by the Lord, and therefore must be
covered, or the sinner can never stand in his presence and be happy.

[Psalms 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 32:2</span></span>

Blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity,.... Or "does
not think of it" (n); with respect unto men, at least to the harm of
them; his thoughts are thoughts of peace, and not of evil; their sins
and iniquities he remembers no more; he does not charge them with them,
he does not reckon them, or place them to their account, having imputed
them to his Son; see [Co2 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019.md). The
Apostle Paul interprets this as inclusive of the imputation of
righteousness without works; even of the righteousness of Christ, in
which the blessedness of a man lies, [Rom
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#006.md); for such an one is accepted with
God, is justified in his sight, and is secure from condemnation and
wrath; it is well with him at all times, in life, at death, and at
judgment; he is an heir of eternal life, will enter into it, and be for
ever glorified;

and in whose spirit there is no guile: for being thoroughly convinced of
sin, he is sincere in his repentance for it, without deceit and
hypocrisy in his confession of it; as David, the Apostle Paul, and the
publican were, when they acknowledged themselves sinners; his faith, in
looking to Christ for pardon and righteousness, is from the heart, and
is unfeigned, and so is his profession of it before God, angels, and
men; and whatever hypocrisy and guile are remaining in the old man,
there is none in the new spirit put into him; in the new man, which is
created in him, and which sinneth not: as the other phrases are
expressive of pardon and justification, this points at internal
sanctification, and which serves to complete the description of the
happy man; such an one as David himself was; and this happiness he
illustrates from his own experience in the following verses.

\(n\) "cogitat", Piscator; "cogitando reputavit", Gejerus; so Ainsworth.

[Psalms 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 32:3</span></span>

When I kept silence,.... Was unthoughtful of sin, unconcerned about it,
and made no acknowledgment and confession of it to God, being quite
senseless and stupid; the Targum adds, "from the words of the law";
which seems to point at sin as the cause of what follows;

my bones waxed old; through my roaring all the day long; not under a
sense of sin, but under some severe affliction, and through impatience
in it; not considering that sin lay at the bottom, and was the occasion
of it; and such was the violence of the disorder, and his uneasiness
under it, that his strength was dried up by it, and his bones stuck out
as they do in aged persons, whose flesh is wasted away from them; see
[Psa 102:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#003.md).

[Psalms 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 32:4</span></span>

For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me,.... Meaning the afflicting
hand of God, which is not joyous, but grievous, and heavy to be borne;
especially without his gracious presence, and the discoveries of his
love: this continued night and day, without any intermission; and may
design some violent distemper; perhaps a fever; since it follows,

my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. That is, the radical
moisture in him was almost dried up, as brooks in the summer season; his
body was parched, as it were, with the burning heat of the disease; or
with an apprehension of the wrath of God under it, or both: and so he
continued until be was brought to a true sense of sin, and an
acknowledgment of it, when he had the discoveries of pardoning love, as
is expressed in [Psa 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#005.md). The
Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions read, "I am turned into distress,
through a thorn being fixed"; and so Apollinarius paraphrases the words,

"I am become miserable, because thorns are fixed in my skin;''

reading for and which Suidas (o) interprets "sin", that being like the
thorn, unfruitful and pricking; see [Co2
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007.md).

Selah; on this word; see Gill on [Psa
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#002.md).

\(o\) In voce

[Psalms 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 32:5</span></span>

I acknowledged my sin unto thee,.... The sin of Adam, in which he was
concerned; original sin, the corruption of his nature, the sin that
dwelt in him, his private and secret sins, which none knew but God and
himself; even all his sins, which were many, with all their aggravated
circumstances; wherefore he uses various words to express them by, in
this and the following clauses; as "sin", "iniquity", and
"transgressions"; the same that are used in the doctrine of pardon in
the preceding verses; his confession being of the same extent with
pardon, and all these he calls his own; as nothing is more a man's own
than his sins are; and these the psalmist acknowledged to the Lord; or
"made", or "will make known" (p) to him: not that any sin is unknown to
God, even the most secret ones; but they may be said to be made known to
God, when a sinner makes a sincere and hearty acknowledgment of them
before him, and expresses his own sense of them; how that they are with
him, and ever before him, what knowledge rather he has of them, how much
he is affected with them, and concerned for the commission of them; and
such an acknowledgment the Lord expects and requires of his people, [Jer
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#012.md);

and mine iniquity have I not hid; by retaining it as a sweet morsel
under his tongue; for he not only acknowledged it, but forsook it; or by
not confessing it, as Achan; for not confessing sin is the of hiding it;
or by denying it, as Gehazi, Ananias and Sapphira; or by palliating and
extenuating it; or by casting the blame on others, as did Adam and his
wife; see [Job 31:33](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#033.md); or by covering
it with a guise of sanctify and religion;

I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; not unto men,
though in some cases confession of sin is to be made to men; a
confession of it in general is to be made to the churches, and
administrators of ordinances, in order to admission into a church state,
and to the ordinances of Christ, [Mat
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#006.md); and in case of private offences,
faults are to be confessed one to another, and forgiveness granted; and
in case of public offences, a confession should be made to a church
publicly; partly for the satisfaction of the church, and partly for the
glory of divine grace; but confession is not to be made to a priest, or
to a person in a ministerial character, in order for absolution; but to
the Lord only, against whom sin is committed, and who only can pardon
it: and this the psalmist saith in his heart he would do, and did do it;
he not only confessed facts, but the fault of them, with their evil
circumstances, and that he justly deserved punishment for them; and this
he did from his heart, with abhorrence of the sins committed by him, and
in faith, with a view to the pardoning mercy of God in Christ;

and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. That is, either the guilt of
his sin, which he took away from him; or the punishment of it, which he
delivered him from: moreover, this phrase may denote the exceeding
sinfulness of sin, and so may both express the sense which the psalmist
had of it, and exalt the grace of God in the forgiveness of it; by which
must be meant a fresh manifestation and application of pardon to his
soul: now, when confession of sin, and remission of it, are thus put
together, the sense is not that confession of sin is the cause of
pardon; it is not the moving cause of it, that is the grace and mercy of
God; nor the procuring and meritorious cause of it, that is the blood of
Christ: it is not for the sake of a sinner's confession of sin, but for
Christ's sake, that sin is forgiven; but this is the way in which it is
enjoyed; and such as truly repent of sin, and sincerely confess it, are
the persons to whom the Lord manifests his forgiving love; such may
expect it, [Pro 28:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#013.md).

Selah; on this word; see Gill on [Psa
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#002.md).

\(p\) "cognoscere feci te", Pagninus, Montanus; so Musculus, Vatablus;
so Junius & Tremellius, Piscator, & Gejerus, to the same purport.

[Psalms 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 32:6</span></span>

For this shall everyone that is godly pray unto thee,.... Meaning either
that the success he had met with, in acknowledging his sin, would
encourage others also to take a like step, and make their supplications
to the Lord also; or that every godly person should pray to God for the
same blessing of pardoning grace likewise. Pardon of sin is to be prayed
for; not only Moses, David, Daniel, and other Old Testament saints,
prayed for it; but Christ has directed his disciples and followers,
under the Gospel dispensation, to do the same, [Luk
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#004.md); and which must be understood of
praying for the manifestation of it to their consciences; for God has by
one eternal act forgiven all trespasses at once, for Christ's sake; nor
can any new act of pardon arise in the mind of God, or a fresh one pass
in the court of heaven, nor the blood of Christ be shed again for the
remission of it. Moreover, godly men will, in this sense, pray for it,
as they have daily occasion to do: a godly man is a man that is created
after the image of God, is born of him, and is possessed of internal
powerful godliness, and has all things pertaining to it; and
particularly has a godly sorrow for sin, and the fear of God in his
heart, and before his eyes: and such a man is a praying one; having the
spirit of grace, he has the spirit of supplication, and prays with the
Spirit and with the understanding; and his praying for the pardon of sin
shows that he is not without it, but daily commits it, and so needs
fresh discoveries of forgiving love: and which he prays for

in a time when thou mayest be found; which is to be understood, not of
any particular stated times of prayer, as morning, noon, and night; for
the throne of grace is always open, and God is to be found, and grace
and mercy with him at all times; and much less does this respect a day
of grace for particular persons, which, if improved, and the opportunity
taken, they may have pardon; but if neglected till it is over, then
there is no pardon for them; for there is no such day of grace: the
whole Gospel dispensation is a day of grace; and that will not be over
until all the elect of God are gathered in; and until then it is, and
will be; now is the accepted time, now is the day of salvation; but it
designs a time of need, of soul distress, in which, when persons call
upon God in truth, and seek him with their whole heart, he is found by
them, and they find grace and mercy with him to relieve them in their
distress; the Targum is,

"in an acceptable time;''

surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him;
that is, unto the godly man; not but that afflictions, which are
comparable to great floods of waters, do reach godly persons; but not so
as to overwhelm them and destroy them; they are delivered out of them.
The phrase seems to denote safety in the greatest calamities; that
though even a deluge of vengeance and awful judgments should come upon
the world, yet the godly man is safe; his place is the munition of
rocks; he is in the hands of Christ, and is enclosed in the arms of
everlasting love, from whence he can never be taken by men or devils:
the Targum interprets these "waters of many people"; and adds, so as "to
do any evil", or "hurt".

[Psalms 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 32:7</span></span>

Thou art my hiding place,.... In time of trouble; see [Psa
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#005.md); so Christ is said to be, [Isa
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#002.md). "Thou shall preserve me from
trouble"; not from having it; for in this world the saints must have
tribulation, and through it enter the kingdom, but from being swallowed
up with it; the Lord will bring them safe out of it, and of them it
shall be said, "these are they that came out of great tribulation", [Rev
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#014.md);

thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance; or gird with
gladness, as in [Psa 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#011.md); the
meaning is, that God would give him abundant reason for praise and
thankfulness; and an opportunity of attending him with songs of praise
for deliverance out of the hands of his enemies, and from trouble; and
that both in his house below, where the saints, his loving people and
faithful subjects, would join with him, in the midst of whom he should
stand encompassed with their songs of praise; or in heaven above, where
he should sing the song of Moses, and of the Lamb, and be surrounded
with the hallelujahs of angels and glorified saints; Aben Ebra
interprets these songs of the voices of angels.

Selah; on this word; see Gill on [Psa
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#002.md).

[Psalms 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 32:8</span></span>

I will instruct thee,.... Or "cause thee to understand" (q). These are
by many thought to be the words of the Lord, who gives to a man an
understanding of spiritual things; he instructs by his providence, and
even by afflictive dispensations of providence; and by his word, which
is written for the learning of men, and is profitable for doctrine and
instruction in righteousness, and by the ministers of it, who are
therefore called instructors in Christ; and by his Spirit, when he
instructs effectually and to purpose; by him he instructs men in the
knowledge of themselves, and of himself in Christ, and of peace, pardon,
righteousness, and salvation by Christ; and leads into all truth as it
is in Jesus; and opens the understanding to understand the Scriptures,
and the doctrines contained in them;

and teach thee in the way which shall go; the path of duty, from whence
men are apt to wander; when the Lord hedges up the way they would go
with thorny providences, and by his ministers, word, and Spirit, directs
them in the right way; saying, this is the way, walk in it; and the way
of truth, which is clearly pointed to in the Scriptures of truth, and by
the Spirit of truth; and also the way of life and salvation by Christ,
revealed in the Gospel and which the preachers of it show to the sons of
men;

I will guide thee with mine eye; as a master guides his scholar; or as
"mine eye" (r): with as much care and tenderness as if thou wert the
apple of mine eye; see [Deu 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#010.md); or
the words may be rendered, "I will counsel", or "give counsel"; as he
does, who is wonderful in counsel, and that by his Son, who is the
wonderful Counsellor; and by his word and testimonies, which are the
delight of his people, and the men of their counsel: "mine eye is upon
thee" (s); as the eye of the Lord is upon the righteous, to watch over
them for good, to provide for them, guide and direct them. These words
may very well be considered as the words of David, in which he
determines to act a part, agreeable to the title of the psalm,
"Maschil"; which signifies instructing, or causing to understand; and as
he thought himself bound in duty to do, under the influence of the grace
and mercy he had received from the Lord, in the forgiveness of his sins;
and which he elsewhere resolved to do in a like case, and which is an
instance parallel to this, [Psa 51:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#013.md);
he here promises to "instruct" men in the way of attaining to the
blessedness he had been speaking of, by directing them to take the steps
he did; namely, to go to the, Lord, and acknowledge and confess their
sins before him, when they might expect to find pardoning mercy and
grace, as he did; and to "teach" them the way of their duty upon this,
to fear the Lord and his goodness, and to serve him in righteousness and
holiness all the days of their lives; and to "guide them with his eye";
by declaring to them the gracious experiences he had been favoured with,
by telling them what he himself had seen and known.

\(q\) "intellectum tibi dabo", V. L. Musculus; "intelligere faciam te",
Pagninus, Montanus; so Ainsworth. (r) "consulam tibi sicut oculo meo",
Drusius. (s) "Consulam, super te est oculus meus", Cocceius, Gejerus,
Ainsworth; so the Targum.

[Psalms 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 32:9</span></span>

Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding,....
The design of this exhortation is to direct men how to behave under the
instructions given; not as brutes, which have no rational faculties, but
as men; that they should not show themselves thoughtless, stupid, and
unteachable, as these animals, or worse than they; nor stubborn and
obstinate, refractory and untractable, resolving not to be taught,
stopping the ear, and pulling away the shoulder; nor ill natured and
mischievous; not only hating instruction, casting away the law of the
Lord, but kicking and spurning at, and persecuting such who undertake to
instruct them; as these creatures sometimes attempt to throw their
riders, and, when down, kick at them;

whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near
unto thee; to do mischief, bite or kick; or "because they do not come
near to thee" (t); and that they may come near, and be brought into
subjection, and become obedient; therefore such methods are used; see
[Jam 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#003.md); there is in the words a
tacit intimation, that men are commonly, and for the most part, like
these creatures, stupid, stubborn, and mischievous; and therefore severe
methods are used by the Lord, sore chastenings, to humble and instruct
them; see [Jer 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#018.md); the mule, more
especially, is remarkable for its stupidity (u); and though the horse is
docile, yet he is sometimes stubborn and refractory.

\(t\) "quia non accedunt ad te", Grotius. (u) "Mule, nihil sentis----",
Catullus.

[Psalms 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 32:10</span></span>

Many sorrows shall be to the wicked,.... Who will not be instructed and
reformed, but are like the horse and mule, without understanding; many
outward sorrows or afflictions attend them; loathsome and consuming
diseases come upon their bodies by intemperance and debauchery; and they
and their families are brought to a piece of bread, through their
vicious courses; and inward sorrows, horror and terror of mind, seize
them when their consciences are at any time awakened, and are open to
conviction; when a load of guilt lies on them, what remorse of
conscience they feel! and what severe reflections do they make! and how
are they pierced through with many sorrows! And though indeed, for the
most part, wicked men have their good things in this life, and are in
prosperous circumstances, and are not in trouble, as other men; yet what
they have is with a curse; and they have no true peace, pleasure, and
satisfaction in what they enjoy; and the curses of a righteous law; and
everlasting destruction is prepared for them in the other world, when
they will have many sorrows indeed; their worm will not die, and the
fire of divine fury will not be quenched; there will be for ever
indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man
that does evil;

but he that trusteth in the Lord; not in his wealth and riches, in his
wisdom and strength, in himself, and his own righteousness; for such are
wicked persons; but in the Lord; in his righteousness to justify him, in
his blood to pardon him, in his strength to support him, and in his
grace to supply him with everything necessary for him;

mercy shall compass him about; not only follow him and overtake him, but
surround him; he shall be crowned with lovingkindness and tender
mercies: the phrase denotes the abundance of mercies that shall be
bestowed upon him here and hereafter, as both grace and glory.

[Psalms 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 32:11</span></span>

Be glad in the Lord,.... The Targum renders it, "in the Word of the
Lord"; in Christ the essential Word; in him as the Lord their
righteousness, and because of his righteousness imputed to them, by
which they become righteous; and in him as their Saviour and Redeemer,
and because of the salvation which he has wrought out for them; see [Isa
61:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010.md);

and rejoice, ye righteous; in the Lord, as before; for this is not a
carnal, but spiritual joy, which is here exhorted to, the same as in
[Phi 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#004.md); and "righteous" ones, who
are excited to it, are such who are not righteous in appearance only, or
in their own conceit, or by the deeds of the law, or in and of
themselves; for there is none righteous this way: but who are made
righteous by the obedience of Christ, and are righteousness itself in
him; under a sense of which grace they live soberly, righteously, and
godly; and these have great reason to rejoice and be glad;

and shout for joy all ye that are upright in heart: who have the truth
of grace, and the root of the matter in them, oil in the vessels of
their hearts, with their lamps; whose faith is unfeigned, whose hope is
without hypocrisy, and whose love is without dissimulation; and who
worship the Lord in spirit and in truth, and draw nigh to him with true
hearts, and call upon him in the simplicity of them; these ought to
rejoice, and even shout for joy, because of the grace that is wrought in
them, and bestowed upon them, and the glory they shall be partakers of;
for both grace and glory are given to these, and no good thing is
withheld from them; the end of these upright souls is peace; and when
they have done their work, they shall lie down and rest in their beds,
and each one shall walk in his uprightness, [Psa
84:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#011.md).
