INTRODUCTION TO NUMBERS 29

In this chapter an account is given of the various offerings on the
several remarkable days in the seventh month of the year; at the feast
of blowing the trumpets on the first day of the month, [Num
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#001.md), at the great fast or day of
atonement, which was the tenth of the month, [Num
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#007.md), and at the feast of tabernacles,
which began on the fifteenth day of the same month, and continued eight
days, and the sacrifices of every day are particularly mentioned; of the
first day, [Num 29:12](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#012.md), of the second
day, [Num 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#017.md), of the third day,
[Num 29:20](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#020.md), of the fourth day, [Num
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#023.md), of the fifth day, [Num
29:26](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#026.md), of the sixth day, [Num
29:29](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#029.md), of the seventh day, [Num
29:32](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#032.md), and of the eighth day, [Num
29:35](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#035.md), which sacrifices were to be
offered, besides their vows and freewill offerings, of which Moses gave
a faithful account, according to the command of God, [Num
29:39](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#039.md).

[Numbers 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 29:1</span></span>

And in the seventh month,.... The month Tisri, as the Targum of
Jonathan, which answers to part of our September and October; a month
famous for days to be religiously observed, having more of them in it
than any other month in the year:

on the first day of the month, ye shall have a holy convocation; see
[Lev 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#024.md),

ye shall do no servile work; therefore, in the place referred to, is
called a sabbath:

it is a day of blowing the trumpets unto you; of which; see Gill on [Lev
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#024.md).

[Numbers 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 29:2</span></span>

And ye shall offer a burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the
Lord,.... Which was as follows:

one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year without
blemish, which was the same, only one bullock less, with the offerings
on the first day of the month, the seven days of unleavened bread, and
the day of the firstfruits, [Num
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#011.md), [Num
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#019.md), [Num
28:27](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#027.md).

[Numbers 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 29:3</span></span>

And their meat offering,.... Which went along with the creatures offered
for a burnt offering; the quantity of flour and oil used in it was the
same, for a bullock, a ram, and each lamb, as in the offerings at the
new moons, feast of unleavened bread and the day of firstfruits, [Num
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#010.md) and a kid of the goats was also
offered for a sin offering at this time, as in those seasons, and for
the same purpose, to make atonement for the sins of their holy things.

[Numbers 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 29:6</span></span>

Beside the burnt offering of the month, and his meat offering,.... The
bullock, ram, and seven lambs, were offered on this day, besides the two
bullocks, one ram, and seven lambs, which were offered on it, on account
of its being the first day of the month and besides the meat offering
that went along with them; these were not omitted on account of those
additional sacrifices:

and the daily burnt offering; the two lambs of the daily sacrifice;
these also were offered as usual, so that there were offered on this day
three bullocks, two rams, and sixteen lambs:

and his meat offering, and their drink offerings, according to their
manner; these also were offered with the daily sacrifice, according to
the law and rule prescribed for the making of them, and all were

for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the Lord; for they
were burnt sacrifices, and very acceptable to the Lord, as they were
types of the better sacrifice, with which he is infinitely well pleased;
and it is with respect to that that such a number of sacrifices were
appointed.

[Numbers 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 29:7</span></span>

And ye shall have on the tenth day of the seventh month an holy
convocation,.... The month Tisri, as before; so the Targum of Jonathan:

and ye shall afflict your souls; or persons; their bodies by fasting,
and their souls by repentance and humiliation; for this was a grand
fast, as it is called [Act 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#009.md),

ye shall not do any work therein; see [Lev
23:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#028.md).

[Numbers 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 29:8</span></span>

But ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the Lord,.... Which is the same
as ordered to be offered on the first day, [Num
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#002.md). Aben Ezra is of opinion that the
ram here is different from those in [Lev
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#003.md).

[Numbers 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 29:9</span></span>

And their meat offering,.... Which was of the same quantity of flour and
oil, for a bullock, a ram, and a lamb, as for the meat offering on the
first day of the month.

[Numbers 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 29:11</span></span>

One kid of the goats for a sin offering,.... This also, as it was
different from that which was offered for the service of the day, so it
was offered after it; as is observed by the Jewish writers, that the
goat, which was offered without, though of the Musaphim, or additions,
could not go before the service of the day for it is said as follows:

beside the sin offering of atonement; hence, say they, we learn, that
the goat within, which was of the service of the day, went before it
(n); after that the ram of Aaron, and the ram of the people, and after
that the fat of the sin offering:

and the continual burnt offering, and the meat offering of it, and their
drink offerings; which were never omitted on account of the service of
any day, though ever so solemn, as this was: hence it appears that there
were offered on this day of atonement two bullocks, three rams, three
goats, and two lambs.

\(n\) Bartenora in Misn. Yoma, c. 7. sect. 3.

[Numbers 29:12](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 29:12</span></span>

And on the fifteenth day of the seventh month ye shall have an holy
convocation,.... Of the same month Tisri, which was the seventh from
Nisan or Abib, though it was formerly the first month of the year:

ye shall do no servile work, and ye shall keep a feast unto the Lord
seven days; the feast of tabernacles, which began on the fifteenth day
of this month.

[Numbers 29:13](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 29:13</span></span>

And ye shall offer a burnt offering,.... That is, on the first of the
seven days, which was as follows:

thirteen young bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs of the first year,
they shall be without blemish; a very large sacrifice indeed, for these
were offered besides one kid of the goats, for a sin offering, and the
two lambs of the daily sacrifice, which were not omitted on account of
this extraordinary offering; so that there were no less than thirty two
animals sacrificed on this day: the meat and drink offerings for each,
according to the kind of them, were as usual, and as before frequently
observed; and the same sacrifices, meat offerings, and drink offerings,
were offered on the six following days of the feast, only with this
difference, that there was one bullock less every day; which it is
thought may denote the decrease of sin in the people, and so an increase
of holiness, or rather the gradual waxing old and vanishing away of the
ceremonial law, and the sacrifices of it; and these bullocks ending in
the number seven, which is a number may lead us to think of the great
sacrifice these all typified, whereby Christ has perfected them that are
sanctified.

[Numbers 29:35](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">num 29:35</span></span>

On the eighth day ye shall have a solemn assembly,.... The day after the
seven days of the feast of tabernacles were ended; for this was not
properly a part of that feast, but was a sort of appendage to it:

ye shall do no servile work therein; See Gill on [Lev
23:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#036.md).

[Numbers 29:36](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">num 29:36</span></span>

But ye shall offer a burnt offering,.... Which was the same that was
offered on the first and tenth days of this month, [Num
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#002.md) and the meat and drink offerings
for each of the creatures were the same, as often expressed; and on this
day a goat for a sin offering was also offered, besides the daily
sacrifice, and what went along with that.

[Numbers 29:39](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">num 29:39</span></span>

These things ye shall do to the Lord, in your set feasts,.... Or rather
in the times set and appointed to you, as the Jewish writers (o)
interpret it; and so Jarchi interprets it of a fixed time, which seems
better; since these were not all feast days, on which the above
sacrifices were to be offered, for one of them was a fast, even the day
of atonement:

besides your vows, and your freewill offerings: which might be offered
up at any time, notwithstanding the above sacrifices, which were
necessary and obligatory; but these were at their own option:

for your burnt offerings, and for your meat offerings, and your drink
offerings, and for your peace offerings; of which see [Lev
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#011.md).

\(o\) Maimon. & Bartenora in Misn. Pesach, c. 7. sect. 4.

[Numbers 29:40](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">num 29:40</span></span>

And Moses told the children of Israel,.... All these things; repeated
the several laws unto them concerning the above sacrifices, with the
additions unto them, and explanations of them:

according to all that the Lord commanded Moses; being a faithful servant
to the Lord in all his house, and in all things appertaining to it.
