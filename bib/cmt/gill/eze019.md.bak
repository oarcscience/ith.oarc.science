### [Ezekiel Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 19:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO EZEKIEL 19

The subject matter of this chapter is a lamentation for the princes and
people of the Jews, on account of what had already befallen them, and
what was yet to come, [Eze 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#001.md). The
mother of the princes is compared to a lioness, and they to lions; who,
one after another, were taken and carried captive, [Eze
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#002.md); again, their mother is compared
to a vine, and they to branches and rods for sceptres, destroyed by an
east wind, and consumed by fire, [Eze
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#010.md).

[Ezekiel 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 19:1</span></span>

Moreover, take thou up a lamentation,.... These words are directed to
the Prophet Ezekiel, to compose a doleful ditty, a mournful song, such
as was used at funerals; and by it represent the lamentable state of the
nation of the Jews and their governors, in order to affect them with it,
with what was past, and present, and yet to come:

for the princes of Israel; or, "concerning them" (s); the princes meant
are Jehoahaz, Jehoiakim, Jeconiah, and Zedekiah, who were kings, though
called princes, these words being synonymous; or, if so called by way of
diminution, the reason might be, because they were tributary, either to
the king of Egypt, or king of Babylon.

\(s\) "de principibus Israel", Junius & Tremellius, Piscator, Polanus,
Starckius; so Ben Melech.

[Ezekiel 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 19:2</span></span>

And say, what is thy mother?.... That is, say so to the then reigning
prince, Zedekiah, what is thy mother like? to what is she to be
compared? by whom is meant, not the royal family of David only, or
Jerusalem the metropolis of the nation, but the whole body of the
people; and so the Targum interprets it of the congregation of Israel.
The answer to the question is,

a lioness; she is like to one, not for her strength and glory, but for
her cruelty and rapine; for her want of humanity, mercy, and justice:

she lay down among lions; that is, kings, as the Targum interprets it
Heathen princes, the kings of the nations about them, as of Egypt and
Babylon, [Jer 50:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#017.md); so called for
their despotic and arbitrary power, tyranny, and cruelty: now this
lioness, the people of the Jews, lay down among them, joined with them
in leagues and marriages, and learned their manners, and became of the
same temper and disposition:

she nourisheth her whelps among young lions; princes, as the Targum
explains it; either the princes of Judah, who were become like young
lions, fierce and cruel; or the princes of other nations, among whom the
children of the royal family were brought up; or, however, they were
trained up in the principles of such, even of arbitrary and despotic
power, and were taught to oppress their subjects, and not execute
justice and mercy among them.

[Ezekiel 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 19:3</span></span>

And she brought up one of her whelps,.... Or sons, as the Targum: or,
"made him to ascend" (t), as the word signifies; to mount the throne;
this was Jehoahaz, whom the people of the land took and anointed him,
and made him king in the stead of Josiah his father, [Kg2
23:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#030.md);

it become a young lion; that is, a king, as the same Targum explains it,
and a tyrannical and arbitrary one:

and it learned to catch the prey; being instructed by evil counsellors,
he soon learned to oppress his subjects, to get their substance from
them, and do many evil things, as he is said to do, [Kg2
23:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#032.md);

it devoured men; or a man, Adam, the people of Israel, so called, [Eze
34:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#031.md); as the Jews frequently observe;
it ate up and destroyed their liberties, privileges, and property.

\(t\) "et ascendere fecit", Pagninus, Montanus, Tigurine version.

[Ezekiel 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 19:4</span></span>

The nations also heard of him,.... The neighbouring nations,
particularly the Egyptians; the fame of his behaviour reached them; they
were informed how he used his own subjects, and what designs he had
formed, and what preparations he was making against his neighbours;
wherefore they thought it proper to oppose his measures in time, and to
hinder him from proceeding and putting his projects into execution, by
coming out against him, and fighting with him, as they did:

he was taken in their pit; alluding to the manner of hunting and taking
lions, and such like beasts of prey; which was done by digging pits, and
covering the mouths of them with straw, as Jarchi observes, into which
in their flight they fell unawares: so Pharaohnecho king of Egypt came
out against Jehoahaz, and took him, and put him in bonds at Riblah in
the land of Hamath, that he might reign no more in Jerusalem, after he
had been on the throne but three months, [Kg2
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#031.md);

and they brought him with chains into the land of Egypt; or, "with
hooks" (u); in his nose, as in [Isa
37:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#029.md); or with a bridle, as the
Septuagint; or with branches, as the Syriac version, in his jaws; the
Targum renders it in chains, as we do: it is certain that Jehoahaz was
put in bonds or fetters, and carried into Egypt, where he died, [Kg2
23:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#033.md).

\(u\) "in, vel cum hamis", Montanus, Tigurine version, Cocceius,
Starckius.

[Ezekiel 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 19:5</span></span>

Now when she saw,.... That is, his mother, as the Syriac version
expresses it; not his natural mother; as the mother of Sisera looked out
and waited for him; but the congregation of Israel, as Jarchi interprets
it, the body of the Jewish people:

that she had waited; for the return of Jehoahaz out of Egypt, which was
expected for some time: or, "that she was become sick"; or "weak" (w),
and feeble, and brought to a low estate by his captivity, and by the tax
the king of Egypt put upon her:

and her hope was lost; of his return to her any more, and so of being
eased of the tribute imposed, and of being restored by him to liberty
and glory; for the Lord had declared that he should return no more to
his native country, but die in the place where he was carried captive,
[Jer 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#010.md);

then she took another of her whelps; or sons, as the Targum:

and made him a young lion: a king, as the same Targum paraphrases it;
that is, Jehoiakim, the brother of Jehoahaz, who before was called
Eliakim, but his name was changed by Pharaohnecho; and though he is said
to make him king, yet it was by the consent of the people of the Jews.

\(w\) "quod infirmatus esset", Cocceius, Starckius.

[Ezekiel 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 19:6</span></span>

And he went up and down among the lions,.... The kings, as the Targum;
kings of neighbouring nations, as Pharaoh king of Egypt, and
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and sometimes he was subject to the one,
and sometimes to the offer: and his going up and down among them may
denote his continuance as a king; for whereas his brother reigned but
three months, he reigned eleven years:

he became a young lion; an oppressive prince, a cruel and tyrannical
king:

and learned to catch the prey, and devoured men; he was notorious for
his acts of injustice and arbitrary power; for the detaining the wages
of workmen, and for his oppression, violence, and rapine, and shedding
of innocent blood, [Jer 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013.md).

[Ezekiel 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 19:7</span></span>

And he knew their desolate palaces,.... He took notice of the palaces or
seats of the richest men of the nation, and pillaged them of their
treasure and wealth, and so they became desolate: it may be rendered, he
"knew their widows" (x): or, "his own widows"; whom he made so; he slew
the men to get their substance into his hands, and then defiled their
widows:

and he laid waste their cities; by putting the inhabitants to death; or
obliging them to leave them, and retire elsewhere, not being able to pay
the taxes he imposed upon them, partly to support his own grandeur and
luxury, and partly to pay the tribute to the king of Egypt:

and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, by the noise of his
roaring; by his menaces and threatenings, edicts and exactions, he so
terrified the inhabitants of the land, that though it was full of men
and riches, it became in a great measure destitute of both; the people
left their houses, both in city and country, and fled elsewhere with the
remainder of their substance that had not fallen into his hands: his
menacing demands being signified by roaring agrees with his character as
a lion, to which he is compared, [Pro
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#012.md).

\(x\) "et cognovit viduas ejus", Pagninus, Montanus, Cocceius; "viduas
eorum", Vatablus, Starckius; so R. Joseph Kimchi. Which sense is
approved by Gussetius, Ebr. Comment. p. 312. R. Jonah interprets it, "he
broke their palaces"; so Calvin, and some in Vatablus, and R. Sol.
Urbin. Ohel Moed, fol. 96. 1.

[Ezekiel 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 19:8</span></span>

Then the nations set against him,.... Or, "gave against him" (y); that
is, their voice, as Kimchi; they called to one another, to gather
together against him; they gave their counsel against him; they, joined
together, agreed, and combined against him, and disposed their armies,
and set them in array against him:

on every side from the provinces; Nebuchadnezzar and his auxiliaries,
which consisted of the people of the provinces all around, who were
brought together, and placed round about Jerusalem, at the siege of it;
particularly the bands of the Chaldeans, Syrians, Moabites, and
Ammonites, [Kg2 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001.md);

and spread their net over him; which may be expressive both of the
policy, crafty and secret contrivances and designs, of Jehoiakim's
enemies; and of their external force and hostile power against him:

he was taken in their pit; which they dug for him, or by the means which
they contrived for his ruin, and which they put in execution and
effected: the metaphor of a lion is carried on, and the manner of taking
one is alluded to, which is commonly in pits, as Pliny (z) says; and the
Arabs now dig a pit where lions are observed to enter, and covering it
over slightly with reeds, of small branches of trees, they frequently
decoy and catch them (a).

\(y\) "et ediderunt vocem"; Vatablus. (z) "Capere eos ardui erat quondam
operis, foveisque maxime". Plin. Nat. Hist. l. 8. c. 16. (a) Dr. Shaw's
Travels, p. 172. Ed. 2.

[Ezekiel 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 19:9</span></span>

And they put him in ward in chains,.... Or "in an enclosure"; or "in a
collar with hooks" (b); put a collar of iron, as is said, about his
neck, which had hooks in it, and to those hooks chains were put, in
which he was led a prisoner; and it is certain that he was bound in
fetters, in order to be carried to Babylon though it is thought he never
reached thither, but died by the way [Ch2
36:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#006.md);

and brought him to the king of Babylon; to Nebuchadnezzar, who came up
against him with his army of many nations, he having rebelled against
him; and, being taken by his soldiers, was brought to him in chains,
wherever he was, whether without the gates of Jerusalem, or at any other
place; for it is not certain where he was: however,

they brought him into holes; places of confinement, one after another,
in his way to Babylon; where, it seems, before he came thither, he died,
and was cast out on a dunghill, and had no burial, as Jeremiah foretold,
[Eze 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#018.md);

that his voice should no more be heard in the mountains of Israel; in
the kingdom of Israel, to the terror of its inhabitants, threatening
them with death, if they did not answer his exorbitant demands; nor was
it ever heard any more: the allusion still is to a lion traversing the
mountains, and roaring after its prey, to the terror of other creatures.

[Ezekiel 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 19:10</span></span>

Thy mother is like a vine in thy blood,.... Another simile is here made
use of, relating to the same persons; the same that were compared to a
lioness are here compared to a vine, as the people of the Jews
frequently are, [Psa 80:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#008.md); the same
person is here addressed, the then reigning prince, Zedekiah, whose
mother, the Jewish people, from whence he sprung, had been in times
past, and still was, like a vine; and especially with respect to his
blood, the royal family from, chore he descended: the allusion is to the
use of blood laid to the roots of vines, by which they became more
fruitful. It may have regard; as Calvin thinks, to the original of the
Jewish nation, who, when in their blood, or as soon as they were born,
that is, as soon as they became a nation, were at first like a
flourishing vine. Some render the words, "in thy likeness"; so Jarchi,
Kimchi, and Ben Melech; to which the Targum agrees,

"the congregation of Israel, when it did according to the law, was like
to a vine, &c.''

planted by the waters; for in those hot countries vines required water,
and thrived the better for bring near to them, or for being in watery
places; this may denote the many privileges, blessings, laws, and
ordinances, which were for the advantage of the Jewish people; both in
their civil and ecclesiastical state:

she was fruitful and full of branches, by reason of many waters; grew
populous, rich, and wealthy.

[Ezekiel 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 19:11</span></span>

And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bear rule,....
That is, many sprung from her, and rose up in that nation who were fit
to hold sceptres to be kings, rulers and governors, and were such. So
the Targum.

"and there were in her strong rulers, kings that were, highly to subdue
kingdoms;''

such as David, Solomon, and at hers after them: or this may refer to the
times of Josiah, and at his death, who left behind him several sons, who
became kings, besides other princes of the blood; as his brother
Mattaniah, who also was king: and some even carry this to Zedekiah
himself, who had many children, who seemed to be strong rods, fit for
sceptres, or sceptre bearers; that is, to be kings. The allusion seems
to be to the sceptres of the ancients, which were no other than walking
sticks, cut off of the stems or branches of trees, and decorated with
gold, or studded with golden nails. Thus Achilles is introduced by Homer
(c) as swearing by a sceptre; which, being cut off of a trunk of a tree
left on the mountains, and stripped of its bark and leaves, should never
more produce leaves and branches, or sprout again: and such an one, he
observes, the Grecian judges, carry in their hands. Sometimes they were
made of the "oleaster" (d), or wild olive, the same as a shepherd's
staff; for what shepherds were to their flocks, that were kings to men;

and her stature was exalted among the thick branches; as the body and
trunk of a tree rises up higher than the branches, which are thickest
about the middle of it, and so more eminent and conspicuous; thus it was
with the nation of the Jews, and the royal family in it, that appeared
more glorious and excellent among the nobles and princes of it; or, as
the Targum expresses it,

"it was lifted up in its strength above its own kingdom;''

or rather the sense is, that in the days of David and Solomon, and some
others, it greatly exceeded all the kingdoms of the nations round about
it:

and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches; was
seen and taken notice of for the multitude of her people, and the
grandeur of her state.

\(c\) Iliad. 1. l. 234, &c. (d) Paschal. de Coronis, l. 6. c. 19. p.
406, 407.

[Ezekiel 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 19:12</span></span>

But she was plucked up in fury,.... This vine being turned into a
degenerate plant of a strange vine; or the people of the Jews becoming
wicked, disobedient to God, and disregarding his laws and ordinances,
the wrath of God came upon them, and let in the Assyrians among them,
who carried off ten tribes at once; and the tribes of Judah and Benjamin
not taking warning hereby, but continuing and increasing in sinful
courses, great part of them were carried captive into Babylon, with
their king Jeconiah, who succeeded Jehoiakim before mentioned; when the
kingdom seemed to be utterly ruined and destroyed, and is what is here
referred to:

she was cast down to the ground; a phrase expressive of, he entire
overthrow of the nation; for a vine, though plucked up, yet, if
immediately planted again, might grow; but being plucked up, and left on
the ground, and there lie, there is no hope of it; so that this denotes
the desperate case of this people at this time, being in captivity. So
the Targum paraphrases both clauses,

"and it was rooted up with strength out of the land of the house of the
Shechinah, and translated into another land;''

and the east wind dried up her fruit; Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,
and the Chaldean army, compared to an east wind, because hurtful and
pernicious, as that is to trees and fruit, and because Babylon lay
northeast of Judea; the people of, he land are meant by the fruit of the
vine, with their wealth and riches, which were seized upon and wasted,
or carried into Babylon. So the Targum,

"and a king strong as the east wind slew her people;''

her strong rods were broken and withered; or, "strong rod"; the singular
for the plural; which may design King Jeconiah particularly, who with
his mother, wives, princes, and officers, and the mighty of the land,
even all the mighty men of valour, with the craftsmen and smiths, were
taken and carried captive, [Kg2 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#014.md);

the fire consumed them; the wrath of God, which is often compared to
fire, the same with fury in the beginning of the verse; which shows that
it was for sin, which had provoked the Lord to wrath and anger, that all
this ruin came upon the Jewish nation. The Targum is,

"her strong governors removed, and were carried captive; and the people
which are strong, as fire consumed them.''

[Ezekiel 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 19:13</span></span>

And now she is planted in the wilderness,.... In the land of Babylon,
which though a very fruitful country, yet, because of the hardships and
miseries which the Jews were exposed unto in it, was a wilderness to
them:

in a dry and thirsty ground; which is a periphrasis or description of a
wilderness, [Psa 63:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#001.md); and designs the
same place as before; where the Jews were deprived of their liberties,
and had not the opportunities of divine worship, the word and
ordinances; and were destitute of the comforts both of civil and
religious life. Unless this is to be understood of the land of Judea,
which by the devastation made in it by the king of Babylon, and the
multitudes that were carried captive by him out of it, it became like a
desert, a dry and thirsty land; and so the vine planted in it signifies
the remainder of the people left in it, alter this great destruction;
when it looked like a vine plucked up, and thrown down, and left on the
ground, dried up with the east wind, and burnt with fire; and thus it
fared with the remnant in a little time after, as the next words show.

[Ezekiel 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 19:14</span></span>

And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches,.... By "her branches" are
meant the rest of the Jews left in the land; and by the "rod" of them
King Zedekiah, now on the throne, when this prophecy was given out; the
"fire" said to go out of him signifies his rebellion against the king of
Babylon, his breaking covenant and oath with him, which greatly provoked
the Lord, and brought down the fire of his wrath upon him, [Kg2
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#020.md);

which hath devoured her fruit; destroyed the people by sword, famine
pestilence, and captivity; yea, the city and temple of Jerusalem, with
the palaces and houses therein, were burnt with material fire; their
king was taken, and his eyes put out; his sons were slain, and all the
princes of Judah:

so that she hath no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule; none to be king,
or succeed in the kingdom; and there never was a king after of the
family of David, or of the tribe of Judah, till Shiloh the Messiah came;
though there were princes and governors, yet no sceptre bearer, no king.
The Targum of the whole is,

"and there came people who were strong as fire, and, because of the sins
of her pride, slew her people; and there were not in her strong rulers,
kings that are mighty to subdue kingdoms;''

this is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation; that is, this
prophecy, as the Targum, is a lamentation, or matter of lamentation;
what of it had been already fulfilled occasioned lamentation; and, when
the rest should be fulfilled, it would be the cause of more. Lamentable
was the case of the Jews already, but it would be still more so when all
that was foretold of them should be accomplished. It denotes the
continuance of the sad estate of that people; and perhaps may refer to
their present condition, which will continue till they are turned to the
Lord.
