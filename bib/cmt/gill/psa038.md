INTRODUCTION TO PSALM 38

A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance. This psalm was composed by
David under some sore affliction, and when in great distress of mind by
reason of sin, perhaps his sin with Bathsheba; and was written as a
memorial of his sense of sin, of his great afflictions, and deliverance
from them; and therefore is said to be "to bring to remembrance", or to
refresh his memory with the said things. Kimchi and Ben Melech think the
psalm was made for the sake of such as are in distress, to put them in
mind and teach them how to pray. The Targum calls the psalm,

"a good remembrance concerning Israel;''

and Jarchi says it was to remember the distress of Israel before the
Lord, and that it is said with respect to all Israel; though others
think the word "lehazcir" is the name of a psalm tune; and Aben Ezra was
of opinion that it was the first word of some pleasant poem. The
Septuagint version adds,

"concerning the sabbath,''

as if it was wrote to put persons in mind of that day; whereas there is
nothing in the whole psalm that has any such tendency.

[Psalms 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 38:1</span></span>

O Lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot
displeasure,.... This and the following clause are the same as in [Psa
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001.md), only instead of wrath there it is
anger; See Gill on [Psa 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001.md).

[Psalms 38:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 38:2</span></span>

For thine arrows stick fast in me,.... Meaning either words with which
as a father the Lord rebuked him; and which were sharp and cutting,
entered into him and abode with him, and gave him much pain and
uneasiness; and by which he concluded that his rebukes were in wrath and
hot displeasure; such as those in [Sa2
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#011.md); so the words of men are
compared to arrows, [Psa 57:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#004.md) or
outward afflictions, attended with inward trouble of soul; for as
judgments are the arrows of God, such as famine, pestilence, &c. [Eze
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#016.md), [Deu
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021.md); so the chastening dispensations
of Providence, under which the people of God themselves are, are so
called, because they oftentimes come swiftly, suddenly, and at unawares,
and are very pungent and distressing; and sometimes stick fast and
continue long, by reason of which they are inwardly wounded, and
conceive of God as sorely displeased with them; see [Job
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#004.md);

and thy hand presseth me sore; the afflicting hand of God, which lay
heavy upon him; and is a mighty hand when laid on such worms as mortal
sinful men are, who cannot bear up under it, unless they have divine
supports; see [Job 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#021.md). This is by
some supposed to be some bodily disease inflicted on him; some have
thought of the leprosy, which was a stroke from the hand of God; but
this is not likely, since he must have been deposed and shut up; the
Jews indeed say (e) that he was a leper six months, and that the divine
Presence was taken from him; a late learned man (f) thinks it was the
smallpox, from the unsoundness of his flesh, the soreness of the
disease, the stench of it, temporary blindness, and his friends standing
aloof from him; though perhaps no other than affliction of mired for
sin, comparable to the disease described, is meant.

\(e\) In R. Obadiah in loc. (f) De Laney's Life of King David, vol. 2.
p. 146.

[Psalms 38:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 38:3</span></span>

There is no soundness in my flesh, because of thine anger,.... Such was
the nature of the affliction the psalmist laboured under, and which he
took to be an effect of the anger of God towards him, that the whole
frame of nature was affected with it, and from the crown of the head to,
the soles of the feet there was no health or soundness, as in [Isa
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#006.md); where the same word is used as
here; some think the word (g) here used has the signification of man;
and that the sense is, that through, the violence of the distemper he
had not so much, as the form of a man, as his antitype in [Isa
52:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#014.md); and as this led him to a view
of his sins, as the cause of his affliction, he was so far from thinking
himself sound and whole, or perfect in a spiritual sense, that he saw he
was all over diseased with sin, and that in his flesh dwelt no good
thing;

neither is there any rest in my bones, because of my sin; or "peace" (h)
there; sin breaks the believer's rest, and disturbs his peace; nor can
he, in a view of it, find any rest in himself, nor in any creature, nor
in any service or duty, only in Jesus Christ, his blood, righteousness,
and sacrifice.

\(g\) "non superest amplius ulla forma seu figura hominis", Amama; so
Joseph Kimchi. (h) "non (est) pax", Pagninus, Montanus, Vatablus,
Tigurine version, Junius & Tremellius, Piscator, Musculus, Cocceius,
Gejerus, Michaelis; so Ainsworth.

[Psalms 38:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 38:4</span></span>

For mine iniquities are gone over mine head,.... Like an inundation of
waters, as the waves and billows of the sea; for the waters to come up
to the neck or chin shows great danger; but when they go over the head
the case is desperate, and a person is sinking and drowning; compare
with this [Psa 69:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#001.md); the simile may
denote both the number and weight of sins, and also signifies the
overwhelming distress the psalmist was in, under a view of them;

as an heavy burden, they are too heavy for me; the guilt of sin upon the
conscience, without a view of pardon, lies heavy indeed, and makes a man
a burden to himself, as it did Job, [Job
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#020.md); yea, sin is not only grieving
and afflicting to pardoned ones, and who know they are pardoned, but it
is a burden to them under which they groan; nor is it possible for any
so to bear it as to satisfy and make atonement for it; none but Christ
could ever do this, and he has done it; nor is there any relief for
burdened souls, but by looking to a sin bearing and sin atoning Saviour,
and by casting the burden upon him, who invites them to him for rest.

[Psalms 38:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 38:5</span></span>

My wounds stink, and are corrupt,.... Meaning his sins, which had
wounded him, and for which there is no healing but in a wounded Saviour,
and by his stripes we are healed, [Isa
53:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#005.md); where the same word is used as
here; Christ's black and blue stripes and wounds, as the word signifies,
are the healing of ours, both of sins, and of the effects of them;
which, to a sensible sinner, are as nauseous and loathsome as an old
wound that is festered and corrupt;

because of my foolishness: as all sin arises from foolishness, which is
bound in the hearts of men, and from whence it arises, [Mar
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#022.md); perhaps the psalmist may have
respect to his folly with Bathsheba, which had been the occasion of all
the distress that is spoken of both before and afterwards.

[Psalms 38:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 38:6</span></span>

I am troubled,.... Discomposed and perplexed in mind; his thoughts were
disturbed and irregular, and in the utmost confusion and distress: this
trouble was not only on account of the affliction that was upon him, but
chiefly because of his sin; and which was increased by the view he had
of the displeasure of God, concluding he was come forth against him in
wrath and fury;

I am bowed down greatly; not in his body, at least not in that only, as
if he was bowed together by his disorder, that he could not lift himself
up; for he is said to walk in the next clause: or rather he bowed down
his head as a bulrush voluntarily, and through sorrow and shame could
not lift it up before the Lord; though it may chiefly design the
pressure of his mind, that his soul was cast down within him, and with
all his spiritual reasonings he could not erect himself; it is the Lord
that raiseth up those that are bowed down in this sense; see [Psa
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005.md);

I go mourning all the day long; or "I go black", or "in black" (i);
meaning either that his skin was black, through the disease upon him,
and the trouble that was in him, [Job
30:30](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#030.md); or that he was clothed in black
garments, as a token of mourning; as white garments were of joy and
cheerfulness, [Ecc 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#007.md); and he was
blacker still in his own apprehension, by reason of inward corruptions
and outward transgressions, which appeared in a very black hue, attended
with aggravating circumstances; see [Sol
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#005.md).

[Psalms 38:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 38:7</span></span>

For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease,.... The word here used
has the signification of burning (k); and the Targum renders it, "my
loins are filled with burning"; a burning fever was upon him, or there
was an inflammation in those parts; a hot burning ulcer, which might be
nauseous; and so was true in both senses. Aben Ezra interprets it
abominable and vile; something not fit to be mentioned; and so Kimchi
and Ben Melech. The word is rendered sometimes "lightly esteemed"; as in
[Sa1 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#023.md); and Jarchi thinks it has
this sense here; and the meaning is, that he was vile in his own eyes,
and mean in his own esteem. Doubtless the psalmist has reference to
something more than a bodily disease; at least not to that only, but to
the disease of his soul also, sin, which has the nature of a disease; it
is an hereditary one, which is derived from one to another by
propagation; it is universal, and reaches to all men, and to all the
parts of the body and powers of the soul; it is a complication of
disorders: it is in its own nature mortal, and ever incurable but by
Christ; and, as here, it is a loathsome one; it is loathsome to God, and
to all sensible sinners: and when the psalmist says his loins were
filled with it, it may signify that it was an internal disorder that was
in him; sin that dwelt in him, a law in his members; and may denote the
aboundings of sin in him, the swarms of corruptions that were in him; as
also the pain it gave him, and the quick sense he had of it;

and there is no soundness in my flesh: which is repeated, see [Psa
38:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#003.md); partly for confirmation's sake,
and partly to show the continued sense of it, as persons under a
disorder are continually making mention of it.

[Psalms 38:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 38:8</span></span>

I am feeble,.... Both in body, natural strength being weakened by the
affliction, and dried up like a potsherd by the heat of the distemper;
and in soul, being weak in the exercise of faith and other graces. The
word is used of Jacob, fainting at and disbelieving the news of his son
Joseph being alive, [Gen 45:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#026.md);

and sore broken; in his constitution with the disease, and in his mind
with trouble; especially for his sin, and under a sense of the divine
displeasure; his bones were broken by his fall, and his heart broken
with a sense of sin, [Psa 51:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#008.md);

I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart: which was like
the raging of the sea, as the word (l) rendered disquietness here
signifies; and to which the uneasiness and restlessness of wicked men is
sometimes compared, [Isa 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#030.md); and so
great was the disquietude of this good man under affliction, and sense
of sin and wrath, that he had no rest night nor day; and could not
forbear crying out, in a very hideous manner, like the roaring of a
lion.

[Psalms 38:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 38:9</span></span>

Lord, all my desire is before thee,.... To be delivered from his
afflictions, to have a discovery and application of pardoning grace, and
to have communion with his God: the desire of his soul was unto these
things; and it was some satisfaction to him that it was before the Lord,
and known unto him, before whom all things are naked and open;

and my groaning is not hid from thee; under the weight of his
affliction, the burden of his sin, and which he expressed in prayer to
the Lord, and which is often done with groanings which cannot be
uttered: but even these are known and understood by the Lord.

[Psalms 38:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 38:10</span></span>

My heart panteth,.... Or "goes about" (m); runs here and there, and
finds no rest; as Aben Ezra interprets the word from the Targum he
cites; though the Targum we have renders it, "my heart shakes with
fear", or dread, as persons in a fever. Jarchi interprets the word,
surrounded with grief; it denotes the panting or palpitation of the
heart, through sorrow and dread, and the failing of it, even as at
death;

my strength faileth me, or "forsakes me" (n); bodily strength and
spiritual strength; the strength of faith, hope, and confidence;

as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me; which is often
the case of persons under bodily disorders, their eyes grow dim, and
sight fails them; and this might be true in a spiritual sense of the
psalmist, who had lost sight of God as his covenant God; of his interest
in his love, in the blessings of his grace, and in eternal salvation,
and was walking in darkness, and saw no light.

\(m\) "circuivit", Pagninus, Montanus, Vatablus. (n) "dereliquit me",

[Psalms 38:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 38:11</span></span>

My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore,.... As if it was a
plague sore, lest they should be infected with it; or because they could
not bear the stench of his wounds, and the loathsomeness of his disease,
or to see him in his agonies, and hear his roaring and his groans, [Psa
38:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#002.md); or as taking his case to be
desperate, as if he was just dying, and no help could be given him, [Psa
38:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#010.md); If it was the leprosy, as some
Jewish writers have affirmed, the word translated "sore", being used for
the plague of the leprosy, they were obliged by the ceremonial law to
keep at a distance from him: but this rather seems to be voluntary, and
to proceed from neglect and contempt. These "lovers" and "friends" were
such for whom David had had an affection, and had been friendly to, and
therefore it was ungrateful in them to act the part they did; and such
who had pretended love and friendship to him in his health and
prosperity, but now had deserted him, which is a common case; see [Job
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#013.md). Afflictions try men's friends;
and as that is a time when friendly visits are most wanting and most
useful, so it is an aggravation of the affliction, and makes it the
heavier when such are denied;

and my kinsmen stand afar off; that were near to him by the ties of
nature or friendship.

[Psalms 38:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 38:12</span></span>

They also that seek after my life,.... His avowed and implacable
enemies, whom nothing would satisfy but the taking away of his life:
these came too near him; for these, he says,

lay snares for me, as Satan does for the souls of men, as the Jews did
for Christ, and as wicked men do for the saints, [Psa
124:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#007.md);

and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things; to the injury of
his character and reputation:

and imagine deceits all the day long; contrive artful schemes to
deceive; see [Psa 35:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#020.md).

[Psalms 38:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 38:13</span></span>

But I, as a deaf man, heard not,.... He acted the part of a deaf man,
and made as if he did not hear the mischievous things his enemies spoke;
as Saul, when the sons of Belial spoke against him and despised him,
[Sa1 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#027.md); and as our Lord when his
enemies accused him, [Mat 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#012.md);

and I was as a dumb man, that openeth not his mouth; made no reply to
what they said, and did not render railing for railing; in which Christ
was the antitype of him, [Isa 53:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#007.md).

[Psalms 38:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 38:14</span></span>

Thus I was as a man that heareth not,.... Any thing that is said unto
him; he took no more notice of it than if he had never heard it; but
bore all the railings and calumnies of men with calmness and patience;

and in whose mouth are no reproofs; as if he had nothing to say for
himself, in vindication of his character, and to the refutation of his
enemies; as if he had no arguments to make use of, for the conviction
and reproof of his adversaries.

[Psalms 38:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 38:15</span></span>

For in thee, O Lord, do I hope,.... That he would plead his cause
against his accusers and revilers, and who sought his hurt; that he
should be delivered out of their hands, and out of all his afflictions;
that he should be healed of his diseases, both of soul and body, under
which he laboured; and should again enjoy the light of God's
countenance, and have the discoveries of his pardoning grace and mercy;
and this was the reason why he was so calm and quiet amidst the
unkindnesses of his friends, and the cruel usage of his enemies;

thou wilt hear, or "answer",

O Lord my God; in the midst of all his distresses of body and mind, he
had not given up his interest in God, as his God and Father; which is
the great blessing of the covenant of grace, and which ever continues;
and is the great support of believers, under whatsoever they meet with
in soul and body, from friends or foes; this his God the psalmist
believed would not only hear his cries in his sore distress, but hear
the reproaches of his enemies, and answer them in a providential way in
his own time, by terrible things in righteousness to their conviction
and confusion; and therefore he himself was silent.

[Psalms 38:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 38:16</span></span>

For I said, hear me,.... This he had expressed in prayer to God; he had
committed his cause to him, and entreated him that he would hear and
answer him; giving this as a reason,

lest otherwise they should rejoice over me; at his misfortunes and
calamities, at the continuance of his trouble and distress, both of body
and mind;

when my foot slippeth; as it sometimes did through the corruptions of
nature, the temptations of Satan, and the snares of the world; which is
more or less the case of all the people of God, who are all subject to
slips and falls, though they shall not finally and totally fall away;

they magnify themselves against me; that is, his enemies exulted and
triumphed over him: this was what he found by experience; and therefore
makes use of it as an argument with God, that he would hear and answer
and deliver him out of his trouble, and preserve him from falling.

[Psalms 38:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 38:17</span></span>

For I am ready to halt,.... Meaning either that there was a proneness in
him to sin; see [Jer 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#010.md); or that he
was subject to affliction and adversity, as the same word is rendered in
[Psa 35:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#015.md); and the words are either a
reason and argument used with the Lord, to hear and keep his foot from
slipping, that so his enemies might not rejoice over him, and magnify
themselves against him; as they would do should he fall into sin or into
any calamity, both which he was liable to: or they are a reason why he
was so calm and quiet under the ill usage he met with from friends and
enemies, because he was "ready for halting", or "prepared" (o) for it;
he considered that he was born for trouble and adversity; that God had
appointed him to it, and it was appointed for him, and therefore he was
quiet under it; see [Job 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#006.md); he was
prepared to meet it; he expected it, it being the common lot of God's
people; and therefore when it came upon him it was no strange thing to
him. The Septuagint version, and those that follow that, render the
words, "I am ready for scourges"; and Jerom applies them to Christ, who
was ready to undergo scourges, sufferings, and death itself, for his
people;

and my sorrow is continually before me; that is, for his sin, which was
ever before him, stared him in the face, lay heavy on his conscience,
and appeared very terrible and loathsome to him; his sorrow for it was
without intermission, and was a godly sorrow, a sorrow for sin, as
committed against a God of love, grace, and mercy: or he may mean, that
his affliction, which was grievous to him, was continually upon him
night and day: our Lord himself, David's antitype, was a man of sorrows
all his days.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 38:18</span></span>

For I will declare mine iniquity,.... Either to men, to ease his mind,
justify God in his proceedings with him, and for their caution and
admonition: or rather to God, against whom he had sinned, and who only
could pardon him; with a view to which he was determined to make a free
and open confession of it before him:

I will be sorry for my sin, or "careful" (p) about it; that is, how he
committed it for the future: true repentance for sin produces a
carefulness to abstain from all appearance of it; see [Co2
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#010.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 38:19</span></span>

But mine enemies are lively,.... Or "living" (q) or "live"; not in a
spiritual sense; for they had no lively hope, nor living faith, but were
dead in trespasses and sins; nor merely in a natural sense, or
corporeally, so David was living himself; but in great prosperity and
worldly happiness, and so were brisk and cheerful, and lived a merry and
pleasent life;

and they are strong; not only hale and robust in body, but abounded in
riches and wealth, which are the strength of wicked men;

and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied; that is, such as hated
him without a cause, and made lies and falsehoods the reasons of it:
these increased in numbers, or in their outward state and circumstances;

They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries,.... See Gill
on [Psa 35:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#012.md);

because I follow the thing that good is; or "follow good"; a good God,
whom his soul followed hard after, [Psa
63:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#008.md); the good Shepherd of the sheep,
who led him into green pastures, whither he followed him, [Psa
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001.md); the good Spirit of God his
guide, whom he walked after, [Rom 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#001.md);
good and holy men of God, whom he took for examples and copied after;
and every good work, which he pursued with eagerness and pleasure; and
all this drew upon him the hatred of his adversaries.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 38:21</span></span>

Forsake me not, O Lord,.... Or continue not to forsake; for he seems to
have been under divine desertion, and might be under apprehensions that
God had utterly forsaken him; which he entreats he would not, though his
friends had forsook him, and his own strength had failed and left him,
[Psa 38:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#010.md);

O my God, be not far from me; as to his gracious presence, and with
respect to help and deliverance, otherwise God is not far from any of
his creatures, being omnipresent.

[Psalms 38:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 38:22</span></span>

Make haste and help me,.... Or, "for my help"; his case required haste,
and God does help his people when none else can, and that right early;

O Lord, my salvation; by which it appears that his prayer was a prayer
of faith; he saw that his salvation was in the Lord, and in no other;
and though he had been and was in such a low condition, both in soul and
body, yet his faith was not lost; that is an abiding grace, and will
continue under the influence of the author and finisher of it, until the
end of it is received, the salvation of the soul. R. Moses (r) thinks
the phrase "make haste" is to be repeated here, and read thus, "make
haste, O Lord, to my salvation".
