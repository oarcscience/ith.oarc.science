INTRODUCTION TO 1 CORINTHIANS

This was not the first epistle that was written by the apostle to the
Corinthians, for we read in this of his having written an epistle to
them before, [Co1 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#009.md), but this is the
first epistle of his unto them, that is now extant; and has been
received by the churches, as of divine authority, being written by the
inspiration of God, of which there has been no doubt in any age. The
apostle himself was nearly two years at Corinth; where he preached with
great success; and was the instrument of converting many persons, who by
him were formed into a church state, consisting both of Jews and
Gentiles, as is clear from many passages in this epistle, and whom be
left in good order, and in great peace and harmony; but quickly after
his departure, false teachers got in among them, and bad principles were
imbibed by many of them, and evil practices prevailed among them, and
they fell into factions and parties, which occasioned the apostle to
write this epistle to them, as well as their writing to him concerning
certain things, they desired to have his judgment and opinion of, [Co1
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#001.md), It is thought to be written about
the year of Christ 55, and in the first year of Nero, though some place
it in the year 59. It was written not from Philippi, as the subscription
added to it affirms, but from Ephesus, as appears from [Co1
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#008.md), and, it may be, after the uproar
raised there by Demetrius, as should seem from a passage in [Co1
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#032.md). The matter of it is various.
The apostle first rebukes them for their schisms and divisions; suggests
that their regard to the wisdom of men, and the philosophy of the
Gentiles, had brought the simplicity of the Gospel into contempt with
them; blames them for their conduct in the case of the incestuous
person, and urges them to put him away from them; reproves them for
going to law with one another before Heathen magistrates, and warmly
inveighs against fornication; and then answers several questions, and
resolves several cases concerning marriage; treats of things offered to
idols, and of the maintenance of ministers; and dissuades from idolatry,
and all appearance of it; takes notice of the unbecoming conduct of the
members of the church at the Lord's supper; and discourses concerning
the nature and use of spiritual gifts, and commends charity above them;
observes and corrects some irregularities in the use of their gifts;
proves by various arguments the doctrine of the resurrection of the
dead, which some of them denied; exhorts to a collection for the poor
saints, and to several other things, and concludes the epistle with the
salutations of others, and of himself.
