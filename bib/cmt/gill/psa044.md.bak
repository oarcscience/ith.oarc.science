[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 44:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO PSALM 44

To the chief Musician for the sons of Korah, Maschil. It is not certain
who was the writer of this psalm, nor when it was written, and to what
time it belongs: some have thought it was composed by one of the
Babylonish captivity, and that it gives an account of the church and
people of God in those times; but what is said in [Psa
44:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#017.md) does not seem to agree with [Dan
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#005.md). It is most likely it was written
by David, and to him the Targum ascribes it; though it does not respect
his times; since what is said in [Psa
44:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#009.md) cannot agree with them; yet he
being a prophet might, under a prophetic influence, speak of future
times, and represent the church in them. Some are of opinion that he
prophetically speaks of the times of the Maccabees and of Antiochus,
when the church and people of God suffered much for the true religion,
and abode steadfast in it; so Theodoret: but rather the whole may be
applied to the times of the New Testament, since [Psa
44:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#022.md) is cited by the Apostle Paul,
[Rom 8:36](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#036.md), and is applied to his
times, and as descriptive of the suffering state and condition of the
church then; and which seems to be the guide and key for the opening of
the whole psalm.

[Psalms 44:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 44:1</span></span>

We have heard with our ears, O God,.... The church being in distress
calls to mind the past favours of God to his people, in order to
encourage her faith and hope; and this expression, delivered in such a
form, shows the clearness, evidence, and certainty of what was heard;
and which was heard not only as a tradition from father to son; but
being recorded in the writings of Moses and the prophets, and these
things read both in private and in public, were heard with the ear;

our fathers have told us what works thou didst in their days, in the
times of old: such as the signs and wonders in Egypt, the slaying of the
firstborn there, and the bringing of the people of Israel from thence
with a mighty hand and outstretched arm; which fathers were used to tell
in the ears of their sons, and sons' sons; and of which there were
memorials continued in future ages, which led children to ask their
parents the meaning of them; when they informed them of the wondrous
works of Providence done in former times, and by which means they were
handed down from age to age: see [Exo
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#002.md).

[Psalms 44:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 44:2</span></span>

How thou didst drive out the Heathen with thy hand,.... Of power; that
is, the Canaanites, as the Targum; the seven nations which inhabited the
land of Canaan before the children of Israel came into it, [Deu
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001.md);

and plantedst them: not the Canaanites elsewhere; but, as the same
Targum explains it the house of Israel in their land; which, like a
vine, was removed from one place, and planted in another; and the
settlement of the children of Israel in the land of Canaan is frequently
expressed by this metaphor, [Exo
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#017.md), [Jer
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#021.md);

how thou didst afflict the people; the Egyptians, according to Arama;
rather the Canaanitish nations by wars and desolating judgments;

and cast them out; that is, the same nations out of their land; though
some render this clause, "and didst send them out"; the captive
Israelites, as Arama; or "didst propagate them" (q); meaning the people
of Israel; who being like a vine planted in the and, sent out its boughs
and branches, and became very flourishing and fruitful; see [Psa
80:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#009.md); and so the Syriac version
renders it, "and thou confirmedst them"; but the former sense seems
best, agreeably to which is the Targum, "thou hast broken the nations,
and hast consumed them"; and that all this was the Lord's work appears
by what follows.

\(q\) "has autem germinare fecisti", Tigurine version; "propagasti
ipsos", Piscator; so Ainsworth; but rejected by Gussetius, Ebr. Comment.
p. 859.

[Psalms 44:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 44:3</span></span>

For they got not the land in possession by their own sword,.... There
were many things which show that the possession of the land of Canaan
was not of the Israelites themselves, but of the Lord; as their passing
over into it through Jordan as on dry land; the manner in which Jericho,
the first city of it, was taken, and the smiting of the Israelites by
the men of Ai;

neither did their own arm save them; from their enemies, and deliver
them into their hands: they were too apt to ascribe things to their own
righteousness, merit, and power; but such methods were taken by the Lord
as to prevent such attributions to themselves; see [Deu
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#016.md);

but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance; the
mighty power of God, his outstretched arm in their favour, and which
arose from his pure good will to them;

because thou hadst a favour unto them; was well pleased, and took
delight in them; chose them to be a special people to himself, above all
people on the face of the earth.

[Psalms 44:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 44:4</span></span>

Thou art my King, O God,.... Besides the favours God had done for his
people in time past, the church takes notice of her interest in God as
her King, who was able to protect and defend her, and to deliver her out
of all her distresses, in order the more to strengthen her faith and
hope in him; and, claiming her interest in him, she draws nigh to him
with an holy boldness, and desires him as a King, that by a word of his
(for where the word of a king is, there is power) he would

command deliverances for Jacob; not literally, but mystically
understood; the spiritual Jacob, and people of God; all Israelites
indeed, in whom there is no guile; meaning herself and members: the
blessing desired is "deliverances", or "salvations"; so called, because
the, deliverance or salvation the Lord commands grants, and works out
for his people, is of different kinds, both spiritual and, temporal, and
is a deliverance from various things; from sin, Satan, the present evil
world, wrath to come, and all enemies; and out of various temptations
and afflictions, and which follow successively one upon another; and at
last it is complete and perfect.

[Psalms 44:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 44:5</span></span>

Through thee will we push down our enemies,.... The Chaldee paraphrase
renders it, "through the Word": the essential Word of God, the Lord
Jesus Christ, who is the church's King and God, and has wrought out
complete deliverance and salvation for his people; and he is the horn of
salvation, by which, though weak in themselves, they push down their
enemies, which are many and mighty, and they are more than conquerors
over them: the metaphor is taken from creatures pushing with their horns
those that oppose them, and in defence of themselves; and there seems to
be an allusion to [Deu 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#017.md);

through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us; in
the name of the Lord the saints set up their banners, and in his name
they come forth and fight with their spiritual enemies, that rise up
against them, as sin, Satan, and wicked men; and in the name, and
through the power of the Lord, they tread them down as mire in the
streets; and before long Satan will be wholly bruised under them; and
the antichristian party shall be trodden down by them, and be as ashes
under the soles of their feet; see [Rom
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#020.md).

[Psalms 44:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 44:6</span></span>

For I will not trust in my bow,.... In any carnal weapon, in any
creature help and assistance, or in an arm of flesh, but in the word of
the Lord, and in his name; see [Psa
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#007.md);

neither shall my sword save me; that is, I will not ascribe salvation to
it; the church's weapons are not carnal, but spiritual; not the sword of
the civil magistrate, but the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of
God; Christ's kingdom, being not of this world, is not supported and
defended by worldly means, or carnal weapons.

[Psalms 44:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 44:7</span></span>

But thou hast saved us from our enemies,.... Spiritual ones, and not we
ourselves; and therefore will not trust in ourselves, nor in anything of
ours, but in the Lord, and give him the glory of salvation;

and hast put them to shame that hated us; the men of the world, the seed
of the serpent, and the serpent himself, when his works were destroyed,
and his principalities and powers spoiled by Christ upon the cross;
hence the following boasting of the Lord, and glorying in him.

[Psalms 44:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 44:8</span></span>

In God we boast all the day long,.... Or, as the Targum, "in the word of
the Lord", in Christ, who is God over all, and who of God is made to his
church and people wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption;
so that there is always matter of glorying and boasting in him;

and praise thy name for ever and ever; in this world, as long as life
continues; and in the other world to all eternity; both for the works of
providence and of grace; for deliverances commanded, and for salvation
from all enemies wrought out.

Selah; of this word See Gill on [Psa
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#002.md).

[Psalms 44:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 44:9</span></span>

But thou hast cast off,.... This, with what follows to [Psa
44:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#017.md), describe the desolate and
afflicted state of the church, under the Gospel dispensation, in some
parts and ages of it; and in the light in which it was viewed by the
church, previous to the encouragement she took from the consideration of
favours and benefits formerly bestowed, and of her covenant interest in
God, related in the preceding verses. She looked upon herself as cast
off, because afflicted and persecuted, and the Lord did not arise to her
immediate help and deliverance; this may regard the ten persecutions
under Rome Pagan; See Gill on [Psa
43:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#002.md);

and put us to shame; before men, at the taking of the ark, as Arama;
rather for their faith in God, and boasting of him, when he did not
appear for them, but suffered them to continue in their afflictions and
distresses; which occasioned their enemies to triumph over them, and say
unto them, where is your God? and also before God, who being forsaken by
him, could not come before him with that holy boldness and confidence
they were wont to do; see [Sol 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#014.md);

and goest not forth with our armies; as the Generalissimo of them; see
[Sa1 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#020.md); not leading them forth, and
going before them; not teaching their hands to war and their fingers to
fight; nor inspiring them with courage and valour; nor giving success
and victory to them as formerly; but seeing that Christians, at least in
the first ages of Christianity, had no armies in a literal sense, this
may rather be understood of the lack of success of the Gospel in some
period of it, and of the power and prevalence of antichrist, the man of
sin. The Gospel ministry is a warfare; the preachers of it are good
soldiers of Christ under him; their weapons are not carnal, but
spiritual; great success attended the word in the first times of the
Gospel; Christ went forth with his armies conquering and to conquer; and
multitudes were subdued by him, and became subjects of him; but in some
ages there has been but little success, few have believed the report of
the Gospel, and been converted by it; Christ's ministers have laboured
in vain, Satan's kingdom, though attacked, yet not weakened, nor
Christ's kingdom enlarged, but rather all the reverse; antichrist has
been suffered, as to make war with the saints, so to prevail and
overcome, and will do so, [Rev 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#004.md);
but it will not be always the case, Christ will go forth with his
armies, and make great conquests again, [Rev
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015.md); this may refer to the wars of
the Papists with the Waldenses and Albigenses, who were vanquished by
the former.

[Psalms 44:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 44:10</span></span>

Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy,.... In the times of Eli,
according to Arama; but may he understood of some of the visible members
of the church, and professors of religion, not being valiant for the
truth, and deserting the cause of God and Christ, by reason of
tribulation and persecution arising because of the word;

and they which hate us spoil for themselves; by seizing on the goods and
substance of those they persecuted; enriching themselves by confiscating
their estates and possessions to their own use; or by spoiling others of
them, they deceived with their corrupt doctrines and soul destroying
principles, whereby they became slaves to the antichristian party; this
may respect the same wars as before.

[Psalms 44:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 44:11</span></span>

Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat,.... To be butchered,
and then eaten as sheep are; and therefore are called "the flock of
slaughter", [Zac 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#004.md); as the church
was, not only under the ten persecutions of Rome Pagan, but through the
butcheries and massacres of Rome Papal; who have worried many of
Christ's sheep, have eaten their flesh and drank their blood, and have
become drunken with it; it has been their meat and drink to persecute
the saints of the most High;

and hast scattered us among the Heathen: the Pagan world, as the first
Christians were, who were scattered up and down in the Gentile world
everywhere; see [Pe1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001.md); or the
Papacy, who are sometimes called Gentiles, [Rev
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#002.md); because much of the Gentile
idolatry is introduced into the Popish religion; and among these many of
the true members of Christ and of his church have been carried captive
and scattered; and such will be found there a little before the
destruction of Babylon, and will be called out from thence; see [Rev
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#010.md).

[Psalms 44:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 44:12</span></span>

Thou sellest thy people for nought,.... So God, when he is said to
deliver up his people into the hands of their enemies, is said to sell
them to them; see [Jdg 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#014.md); and
selling them for nought suggests, that in their apprehensions he had no
esteem of them and value for them; just as men, when they have any
person or thing to dispose of they have no regard unto, but choose to be
rid of, will part with it for nothing: and as it follows,

and dost not increase thy wealth by their price; get nothing by the
bargain. This must be understood after the manner of men, and in the
opinion of the church, and not as in reality; no otherwise than as it
has been true, that God has suffered some of his people to be in the
bondage and slavery of mystical Babylon, called Egypt, one part of whose
wares and merchandises are slaves and souls of men, [Rev
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#008.md).

[Psalms 44:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 44:13</span></span>

Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours,.... Which is the common lot
of Christians: Christ and his apostles have given reason for the saints
in all ages to expect it, and have fortified their minds to bear it
patiently, yea, to esteem it an honour, and greater riches than the
treasures of the antichristian Egypt;

a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us; being always
represented as mean and despicable, and reckoned ignorant and accursed,
and as the faith of the world, and the offscouring of all things.

[Psalms 44:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 44:14</span></span>

Thou makest us a byword among the Heathen,.... Among the Papists, as the
Jews were among the Gentiles, [Deu
28:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#037.md); calling them schismatics,
heretics, fanatics, and what not?

a shaking of the head among the people; by way of indignation, scorn,
and contempt; see [Psa 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#007.md).

[Psalms 44:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 44:15</span></span>

My confusion is continually before me,.... Meaning that which is the
occasion of it;

and the shame of my face hath covered me; not by reason of sin, which is
often the cause of confusion and shame in God's people; see [Jer
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#025.md); but on account of what follows.

[Psalms 44:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 44:16</span></span>

For the voice, of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth,.... That is,
antichrist, to whom a mouth speaking blasphemies has been given, and
which he has opened in blasphemy against God, attributing that to
himself which belongs to God; blaspheming his name, his tabernacle, and
them that well in heaven; see [Rev
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#005.md);

by reason of the enemy and avenger; which are very proper characters of
antichrist, who is the enemy of Christ and of his people, and breathes
out vengeance against them; as the same titles are also given to the
Scribes and Pharisees, the implacable enemies of Christ, [Psa
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#002.md).

[Psalms 44:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 44:17</span></span>

All this is come upon us,.... Not by chance, but according to the
purpose and counsel of God; not for sin, and as a punishment of it, but
for Christ's sake and his Gospel; for a profession of faith in him, and
for the trial of it;

yet have we not forgotten thee; not the being and perfections of God, on
which they often meditated, especially as displayed in the affair of
salvation by Jesus Christ; nor the works of God, which were remembered
to encourage faith and hope in their present circumstances, [Psa
44:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#001.md); nor the benefits and favours
bestowed upon them by him; nor his word, worship, and ordinances; their
reproach, afflictions, and persecutions, did not move them from the hope
of the Gospel, and the service of God;

neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant; by disbelieving their
interest in God as their covenant God; by disregarding or not coming to
and making use of Christ the Mediator of it; and by calling in question
their interest in the blessings and promises of the covenant; for
nothing can be more called dealing falsely in or with respect to the
covenant of grace than unbelief about it; which remains firm and sure
notwithstanding all the afflictions that may come on such who are
interested in it: moreover, as this may respect the formal exhibition of
the covenant under the Gospel dispensation, by the ministry of the word,
and the administration of ordinances, the sense may be, that though the
church and her members met with so much reproach and persecution from
men, yet did not drop nor deny any of the truths of the Gospel, nor
corrupt the ordinances of Christ, nor neglect an attendance on them; but
were virgins, pure and incorrupt in doctrine and practice, and followed
the Lamb whithersoever he went.

[Psalms 44:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 44:18</span></span>

Our heart is not turned back,.... To its original hardness, blindness,
and bondage, to its former sin and folly, to cherish, gratify, and
fulfil its lusts and desires; not from God, from love to him, faith in
him, and desires after him; nor from his worship and service; their
trials had no such influence upon them as to cause them to apostatize
from God, neither in heart, nor in action;

neither have our steps declined from thy way; from the way of his
commandments, from the paths of holiness, truth, and faith, being
directed and guided therein by the counsel of the Lord, and kept and
preserved by his power.

[Psalms 44:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 44:19</span></span>

Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons,.... Where men,
comparable to dragons or their poison and cruelty, dwell; particularly
in Rome, and the Roman jurisdiction, both Pagan and Papal, the seat of
Satan the great red dragon, and of his wretched brood and offspring, the
beast, to whom he has given his power; here the saints and followers of
Christ have been sorely afflicted and persecuted, and yet have held fast
the name of Christ, and not denied his faith; see [Rev
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#013.md); the wilderness is the habitation
of dragons; and this is the name of the place where the church is said
to be in the times of the Papacy, and where she is fed and preserved for
a time, and times, and half a time, [Rev
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#006.md);

and covered us with the shadow of death; as the former phrase denotes
the cruelty of the enemies of Christ's church and people, this their
dismal afflictions and forlorn state and condition; see [Psa
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#004.md), [Isa
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#002.md); and may have some respect to the
darkness of Popery, when it was at the height, and the church of Christ
was covered with it, there being very little appearances and breakings
forth of Gospel light any where. According to Arama, the "place of
dragons" denotes the captivity of Egypt, which is the great dragon; and
the "shadow of death", he says, was a name of Egypt in ancient times, as
say the Rabbins; and observes that [Psa
44:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#025.md) explains this; see [Gen
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#014.md).

[Psalms 44:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 44:20</span></span>

If we have forgotten the name of our God,.... As antichrist, and the
antichristian party did in those times, [Dan
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036.md);

or stretched out our hands to a strange god; as not to any of the
Heathen deities under the Pagan persecutions, so not to any images of
gold, silver, brass, and wood, under the Papal tyranny; not to the
Virgin Mary, nor to angels and saints departed; nor to the breaden God
in the mass, never heard of before; see [Dan
11:38](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#038.md).

[Psalms 44:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 44:21</span></span>

Shall not God search this out?.... Undoubtedly he would, was it so, and
expose it, and punish for it; as he will the Balaamites and children of
Jezebel, [Rev 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#018.md); this seems to be
an appeal to God for the truth of all that the church had said
concerning her steadfastness and integrity under the most trying
exercises;

for he knoweth the secrets of the heart; whether the heart is turned
back, or there is any inclination to apostatize from God, or his name is
forgotten in it; as well as whether in fact the hand has been stretched
out, or prayer made to a strange god, [Jer
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#009.md).

[Psalms 44:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 44:22</span></span>

Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long,.... These words are
cited by the Apostle Paul in [Rom
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#036.md); and are applied to his times,
showing the then close attachment of the saints to Christ, and their
strong love and affection for him; and they have the same sense here,
being an instance and proof of the church's integrity and faithfulness
in the cause of God, amidst the sorest afflictions and persecutions; for
the truth of which she appeals to the searcher of hearts; and had their
accomplishment in the ten persecutions under the Heathen emperors, and
under the Papal tyranny; and may be understood of their being threatened
with death, being in danger of it, and exposed unto it continually, [Co1
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#031.md); or of their being in such
troubles and afflictions, which may be called death, [Co2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#008.md); or of the actual slaying them:
and what was done to many of the members of the church she attributes to
herself, because of the union between them; and for the sake of the
worship of the true God, because they would not worship the gods of the
Heathens, nor the image of the beast, multitudes of them were put to
death; and that all the day long, and every day, and that for a long
series and course of time, or continually; and indeed, ever since the
Gospel day or dispensation began, this killing work has been more or
less; and it will continue during the reign of antichrist, until the
measure of his iniquity is filled up, and the afflictions of the saints
are accomplished;

we are counted as sheep for the slaughter; or "as sheep of slaughter"
(q); see [Zac 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#004.md); that is, either as
sheep to be slaughtered for food, their enemies delighting to eat their
flesh and drink their blood; See Gill on [Psa
44:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#011.md), or for sacrifice, they
reckoning it doing God good service to take away their lives, as though
they sacrificed a lamb or a sheep unto him; and which, like sheep, they
have patiently endured: this is the account made of them, not by the
Lord, in whose sight their death is precious; nor by the saints, with
whom their memory is dear; but by their furious persecutors, among whom
they are as sheep among wolves; see [Co1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#013.md).

[Psalms 44:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 44:23</span></span>

Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord?.... Not that sleep properly falls upon
God: the Keeper of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps; his eyes are
always upon his people; he never withdraws them from them, and he
watches over them night and day: but sometimes he seems and is thought
to be asleep; as when wicked men flourish and triumph over the
righteous, and go on in sin with impunity; when their judgment seems to
linger, and their damnation to slumber, though it does not; and when the
saints are under sore afflictions, and the Lord seems to disregard them,
and does not appear for their deliverance; and when things are as when
the disciples were in a storm, and Christ was asleep, to whom they said,
"carest thou not that we perish?" and the Lord may be said to awake, and
it is what is here prayed for, when he stirs up himself and takes
vengeance on his enemies, as he will before long on antichrist and his
followers; and when he takes in hand the cause and judgment of his
people, and pleads it thoroughly, and delivers them out of the hands of
all their oppressors, and gives them the dominion and kingdom under the
whole heaven; see [Isa 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#009.md);

arise; to revenge the blood of his people, and to have mercy on his
Zion;

cast us not off for ever; as he might seem to do, by suffering their
enemies to triumph over them; but in reality he does not; much less with
loathing and abhorrence, as the word (r) used signifies, since his
church is his Hephzibah, in whom he delights, [Isa
62:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#004.md); and still less for ever, since
his love to them is from everlasting to everlasting, and they shall be
for ever with him; See Gill on [Psa
43:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#002.md).

[Psalms 44:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">psa 44:24</span></span>

Wherefore hidest thou thy face?.... See [Psa
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#001.md);

and forgettest our affliction and our oppression. Not that the Lord does
really forget either the persons of his people, which he cannot, since
they are engraven on the palms of his hands, and a book of remembrance
is written for them: nor the afflictions of his people; he knows their
souls in adversity; he chooses them in the furnace of affliction; he
makes all afflictions work together for good, and delivers out of them.
But because deliverance is not immediately wrought, and they sometimes
continue long under their afflictions and oppressions, they seem to be
forgotten by him, as during the ten persecutions and the long reign of
antichrist.

[Psalms 44:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 44:25</span></span>

For our soul is bowed down to the dust,.... Which may signify great
declension in spiritual things, much dejection of mind, and little
exercise of grace, [Psa 119:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#025.md); or a
very low estate in temporals; subjection to their enemies; they setting
their feet upon their necks, and obliging them to lick the dust of them:
and even it may signify nearness to death itself; see [Jos
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#024.md);

our belly cleaveth to the earth; as persons that lie prostrate, being
conquered and suppliants.

[Psalms 44:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">psa 44:26</span></span>

Arise for our help,.... Or, "arise our help" (s). God is the help of his
people, and he is a present help in time of trouble; and he is the only
one; and he can help and does, when none else can;

and redeem us for thy mercies' sake; not for the sake of her integrity
and faithfulness; nor for her sufferings for Christ's sake; but for his
grace and mercy's sake, which is the source and spring of redemption or
deliverance, both temporal and spiritual; and to that the saints ascribe
it, and not to any merit of theirs, or works of righteousness done by
them.
