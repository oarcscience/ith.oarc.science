[3 Kings (1 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001.md)

INTRODUCTION TO 1 KINGS 4

As in the preceding chapter we have a proof of the wisdom and
understanding which the Lord gave to Solomon, as promised, so in this an
account is given of the riches and honour he was possessed of; of him,
as king over all Israel, and of his princes, [Kg1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#001.md); of the providers of food for his
household in the several parts of the land, [Kg1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#007.md); of the largeness and extent of
his dominions, and of the peace and prosperity thereof, [Kg1
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#020.md); of his daily provisions for his
household and for his cattle, [Kg1
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#022.md); and of his superior wisdom and
knowledge to all others in all nations, which brought some out of all to
hear it, [Kg1 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#029.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 4:1</span></span>

So King Solomon was king over all Israel. As David his father was not at
first, only over Judah, and as Solomon's successors were not, after the
division of the kingdom under his son Rehoboam; though this seems to
have a particular respect to what is related in the preceding chapter
concerning the wisdom of Solomon, for which he was so famous, that he
reigned by the consent of all, and in the hearts of all the people of
Israel.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 4:2</span></span>

And these were the princes which he had,.... That were in office about
him, in the highest posts of honour and trust:

Azariah the son of Zadok the priest: or rather his grandson, since
Ahimaaz was the son of Zadok, and Azariah the son of Ahimaaz, [Ch1
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#008.md); though another Zadok may be
meant, and his son not a priest but a prince, as the word may be
rendered, and was Solomon's prime minister of state, and the rather,
since he is mentioned first.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 4:3</span></span>

Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes,.... Their father
Shisha, the same with Sheva, was scribe only in David's time; and he
being dead very probably, both his sons were continued in the office as
secretaries of state, Solomon having more business for such an office,
see [Sa2 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#025.md);

Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder; who was in the same office
in the times of David, and now held it under Solomon, [Sa2
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#016.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 4:4</span></span>

And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host,.... General of the
army in the room of Joab, [Kg1 2:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#035.md);

and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests; so they were when Solomon came
to the throne; but Abiathar was deposed by him after some time, though
he might retain the name afterwards, and be employed, as Ben Gersom
thinks, in case of necessity, in the room of Zadok, or, however, be
employed as a common priest at Jerusalem, upon a reconciliation with
Solomon; though Kimchi thinks another Abiathar is meant, which is not so
likely.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 4:5</span></span>

And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers,.... The twelve
officers who provided food for Solomon's household after mentioned:

and Zabud the son of Nathan; another of the sons of Nathan the prophet:
for he being a principal instrument of settling Solomon on the throne,
had interest enough to promote his sons to the chief places of honour
and trust: and this here

was principal officer, and the king's friend; a chief minister about
him, very intimate with him, that kept him company, privately conversed
with him, was in his secrets, and admitted to great privacy and nearness
to him.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 4:6</span></span>

And Abiathar was over the household,.... Steward of the household:

and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the tribute, over those that
collected the tribute, as the Targum, whether from the people of Israel
or other nations, or both; this man was in the same post in David's
time, [Sa2 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#024.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 4:7</span></span>

And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel,.... Not with respect to
the twelve tribes of Israel, for it does not appear that they had each
of them a tribe under them, but some particular places in a tribe; but
with respect to the twelve months of the year, in which each took his
turn:

which provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his
month in a year made provision; furnished food of all sorts out of the
country in which they presided for the space of one month in a year; by
which means there was always a plenty of provisions at court for the
king's family, and for all strangers that came and went, and no one part
of the land was burdened or drained, nor the price of provisions raised;
these seem to be the twelve "phylarchi", or governors of tribes,
Eupolemus (r), an Heathen writer, speaks of, before whom, and the high
priest, David delivered the kingdom to Solomon; though in that he was
mistaken, that they were in being then, since these were officers of
Solomon's creating.

\(r\) Apud Euseb. Praepar. Evangel. l. 9. c. 30.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 4:8</span></span>

And these are their names,.... Or rather the names of their fathers; for
of many of them not their own names but their fathers' names are given,
as being well known:

the son of Hur, in Mount Ephraim; a fruitful country in the tribe of
Ephraim, from whence this officer was to furnish the king with
provisions for one month in the year.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 4:9</span></span>

The son of Dekar in Makaz,.... A place in the tribe of Dan, on the
borders of it:

and in Shaalbim, and Bethshemesh, and Elonbethhanan; all in the same
tribe, see [Jos 19:41](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#041.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 4:10</span></span>

The son of Hesed in Aruboth,.... Which seems to have been in the tribe
of Judah by the places that follow:

to him pertained Sochoh; there were two places of this name in that
tribe, [Jos 15:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#035.md);

and all the land of Hepher: there was an Hepher in the land of Canaan,
which was a royal city in the times of the Canaanites, [Jos
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#017.md); and there was an Hepher, the
name of a man, a descendant of Judah, to whom, very probably, this land
belonged, [Ch1 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#006.md); unless it can be
thought to be the portion of land given to the daughters of Hepher, [Jos
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#003.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 4:11</span></span>

The son of Abinadab in all the region of Dor,.... The same with Dor and
her towns, belonged to the half tribe of Manasseh, on this side Jordan,
[Jos 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011.md);

which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife; not when he was first
put into this office, when, in all probability, Solomon had not a
daughter marriageable; but behaving well in it, in process of time he
bestowed a daughter of his on him.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg1 4:12</span></span>

Baana the son of Ahilud, to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo, and all
Bethshean,.... All which were places in the tribe of Manasseh, [Jos
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011.md);

which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel; so described, to distinguish it,
as is thought, from Zaretan in [Jos
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#016.md); and the country this officer
presided over reached also

from Bethshean to Abelmeholah, even unto the place that is beyond
Jokneam; the two first of these were in the tribe of Manasseh, and the
last in the tribe of Zebulun, [Jos
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#011.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 4:13</span></span>

The son of Geber in Ramothgilead,.... A city in the tribe of Gad, and
was a city of refuge, [Jos 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#008.md);

to him pertained the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in
Gilead; of which see [Num 32:41](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#041.md);

to him also pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan,

threescore great cities with walls, and brasen bars; called by Josephus
(s) Ragaba, beyond Jordan; See Gill on [Deu
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#004.md).

\(s\) Antiqu. l. 13. c. 15. sect. 5.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 4:14</span></span>

Ahinadab the son of Iddo had Mahanaim. Another city on the other side
Jordan, where both Ishbosheth and David sometimes dwelt, [Sa2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#008.md); this and the places adjacent must
be very fruitful, since this officer was to furnish the king with
provisions for a month once a year from hence,

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 4:15</span></span>

Ahimaaz was in Naphtali,.... Out of that tribe he made a monthly
provision annually:

he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomon to wife; another daughter
of Solomon's, in course of time; See Gill on [Kg1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#011.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 4:16</span></span>

Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher,.... In the tribe of Asher; a very
plentiful tribe, particularly for oil; this officer was perhaps the son
of Hushai, the Archite, David's friend, and, it may be, promoted for his
sake:

and in Aloth; which signifies ascensions, mountains went upon by steps;
near to this place was an high mountain, called the ladder of Tyre (t);
perhaps that and the parts adjacent may be meant here.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 4:17</span></span>

Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah in Issachar. In the tribe of Issachar; he
had the whole tribe at his command to make a monthly provision out of
for the king once a year, as had the preceding officer and the following
one.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg1 4:18</span></span>

Shimei the son of Elah in Benjamin. So described, to distinguish him
from that Shimei that cursed David, who was of the same tribe; See Gill
on [Sa2 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#005.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 4:19</span></span>

Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead,.... Which was beyond
Jordan, and inhabited by the tribes of Reuben and Gad and the half tribe
of Manasseh; this must be understood of all the country, excepting what
was under the jurisdiction of the son of Geber, [Kg1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#013.md); and which had been

the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan;
until it was taken from them by Moses, [Num
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#025.md);

and he was the only officer which was in the land; which is not true of
Geber; for there was another officer in the land of Gilead besides him,
the son of Geber before observed, unless it should be rendered "in that
land", in that part of the land he had; but then the same might have
been observed of all the rest of the officers: the words may be rendered
best, "and there was one officer in the land"; which some understand of
one officer over all the rest, Azariah the son of Nathan, [Kg1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#005.md); but it seems best what other
Jewish writers say (u), that this was another officer appointed for the
intercalated month; when there were thirteen months in the year, there
was an officer in the land fixed for that month to make provision out of
the land; perhaps any where, where he pleased, being not limited to any
certain place. These twelve providers for Solomon's family were emblems
of the twelve apostles of Christ, appointed to provide food for his
family, the church; and if you add to them the Apostle Paul, it will
make thirteen, as this officer did.

\(u\) T. Bab. Sanhedrin, fol. 12. 1.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg1 4:20</span></span>

Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in
multitude,.... Being blessed with great fruitfulness in their families,
and having no pestilential disease among them, nor wars to lessen their
number, and so the promise to Abraham was fulfilled, [Gen
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#017.md); and which was an emblem of
Christ's spiritual subjects, especially in the latter day, whom Solomon
was a type of, see [Hos 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#010.md);

eating, and drinking, and making merry; having a large increase of the
fruits of the earth, and in no fear of any enemies; expressive of the
spiritual joy of believers in the kingdom of Christ, and under the word
and ordinances, [Sol 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#003.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 4:21</span></span>

And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms,.... Not only over Judah and
Israel, but all people round about him, they standing in fear of him; or
who brought him presents, or paid tribute to him, which was an
acknowledgment of superiority over them, and doing homage to him:

from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of
Egypt; that is, from the river Euphrates, as the Targum, which was the
border of his proper domains to the east, to Palestine, inhabited by the
Philistines, which lay to the west, and as far as the border of Egypt,
which was the southern boundary; a like and larger extent of Christ's
kingdom is given, [Psa 72:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#008.md);

and they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life;
this explains in what sense other kingdoms besides were ruled by
Solomon, and subject to him; of Christ his antitype, see [Psa
72:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#010.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 4:22</span></span>

And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine
flour,.... The measure here used was the "corus", or "cor", the same
with the homer, which was equal to ten ephahs, and, according to Bishop
Cumberland (w), held seventy five wine gallons and five pints, and
somewhat more; by which may be known how many gallons of fine flour
these thirty measures held, which were all consumed in one day:

and threescore measures of meal: sixty measures of a coarser sort, for
the servants, not so finely dressed; the same measure is here used as
before; and it is observed by some, that one cor is equivalent to six
hundred forty eight Roman pounds, and allowing to one man two pounds a
day for his food, there would be food enough for 29,160 men out of 90
times 648, or 58,320 pounds (x). Others exaggerate the account;
Vilalpandus says it would have sufficed 48,600 persons; Seth Calvisius
54,000, and Salianus 70,000 (y); the Jews say (z) that he had 60,000
that ate at his table; that is, who were maintained at his court.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 4:23</span></span>

Ten fat oxen,.... Such as were kept up in the stall and fatted:

and twenty oxen out of the pastures; which were killed as they were
taken from thence, and not put up to be fed:

and an hundred sheep; out of the folds:

beside harts, and roebucks, and fallow deer; which were clean creatures,
according to the Levitical law, [Deu
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#005.md); these were hunted in fields, or
taken out of the park, or were presents from other countries; so that
here was plenty of beef, mutton, and venison: for the spiritual
application of this to the antitypical Solomon, and his provisions, see
[Mat 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#004.md);

and fatted fowl; such as we call capons (a); some Jewish writers (b),
because of the likeness of sound in the word here used, take them to be
Barbary fowls, or such as were brought from that country: there is a
sort of birds called which were without a voice, that neither heard men,
nor knew their voice (c).

For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river,.... Or
beyond the river Euphrates, in the sense before given, [Kg1
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#021.md); which accounts for the plenty of
provisions he had, and the revenue with which he supported such a table
he kept:

from Tiphsah even to Azzah; or Gaza, one of the five principalities of
the Philistines. Tiphsah is thought to be the Thapsacus of Pliny (d)
which both he and Ptolemy (e) place near the river Euphrates, since
called Amphipolis; the former places it in Syria, the latter in Arabia
Deserta; and which Strabo (f), from Eratosthenes, describes as 4800
furlongs or six hundred miles from Babylon, and from the place where
Mesopotamia begins not less than two thousand furlongs or two hundred
and fifty miles:

over all the kings on this side the river; the river Euphrates, or
beyond it, in the sense before explained, as the kings of Syria, Arabia,
&c.

and he had peace on all sides round about him; in which he was a type of
Christ, the Prince of peace.

And Judah and Israel dwelt safely,.... Without fear of any injury done
to their persons or properties by any enemy; which is, and will be, more
abundantly fulfilled in Christ, the antitype of Solomon, [Jer
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005.md);

every man under his vine, and under his fig tree; which were principal
trees in the land of Judea, put for all the rest; and the phrase denotes
the happy, safe, quiet, full, and peaceable enjoyment of all outward
blessings, and is used of the times of the Messiah, [Mic
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#004.md);

from Dan even to Beersheba; which were the two extremities of the land
of Israel, north and south:

all the days of Solomon; so long this peace and safety continued, there
being no wars in his time.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg1 4:26</span></span>

And Solomon had forty thousand stalls for horses,.... In [Ch2
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#025.md); it is only four thousand; and
therefore some think that here is a mistake of the copier, of "arbaim",
forty, for "arbah", four; which it is thought might be through divine
permission, in such lesser matters, without any prejudice to the
authority of the Scriptures in matters of faith and practice; but
without supposing this, a reconciliation may be made, by observing, that
here the writer, as Ben Gersom notes, gives the number of the horses
that were in the stables, which were forty thousand, there the stables
themselves, which were four thousand, ten horses in a stable; or here he
numbers the stalls, which were forty thousand, and there the stables,
which were four thousand, there being ten stalls in each; and the word
there has the letter "yod" in it more than here, which is the numerical
letter for "ten", and may point thereunto; or here the writer speaks of
all the stalls for horses Solomon had throughout the kingdom, there of
those only he had in Jerusalem. Benjamin of Tudela (g) affirms, that
these stalls, or stables, which Solomon built very strong of large
stones, are still in being in Jerusalem, and that there is no building
to be seen like it any where; but no other writer speaks of them; nor is
it at all probable that they should remain:

for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; some of the said stalls
of horses were for his chariots, to draw in them for various uses, of
which had 1400, [Kg1 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026.md); and others
to mount twelve thousand horsemen, who were placed in various parts, to
defend kingdom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 4:27</span></span>

And these officers provided victuals for King Solomon,.... The twelve
before mentioned; and this is repeated here, after the account of his
horses, to observe, that they provided for them also, as well as for the
sake of what follows; that the large provision made by them was not only
for Solomon's family and domestic servants, but for strangers from
different arts, who came upon messages to him, or to visit him, and to
behold the splendour of his court:

and for all that came to Solomon's table; which was an open table for
all comers, as there were some from all parts of the earth, [Kg1
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#034.md);

every man in his month; each of the twelve officers provided food in the
month assigned to him:

they lacked nothing; they always had enough to supply the king with, and
they failed not in the performance of their duty, nor came short of
their salaries, being fully and punctually paid them.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 4:28</span></span>

Barley also, and straw for the horses and dromedaries,.... Or rather
mules, by comparing the passage with [Ch2
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#024.md); the particular kind of creatures
meant is not agreed on; though all take them to be a swifter sort of
creatures than horses; or the swifter of horses, as race horses or posts
horses: barley was for their provender, that being the common food of
horses in those times and countries, and in others, as Bochart (h) has
shown from various writers; and in the Misnah (i) it is called the food
of beasts; and Solomon is said to have every day his own horses two
hundred thousand Neapolitan measures of called "tomboli" (k); so the
Roman soldiers, the horse were allowed a certain quantity of barley for
their horses every morning, and sometimes they had money instead of it,
which they therefore called "hordiarium" (l) and the "straw" was for the
litter of them: these

brought they unto the place; where the officers were; not where the king
was, as the Vulgate Latin version; where Solomon was, as the Arabic
version, that is, in Jerusalem; nor

where the officers were; in their respective jurisdictions, as our
version supplies it, which would be bringing them to themselves; but to
the place where the beasts were, whether in Jerusalem, or in any, other
parts of the kingdom:

every man according to his charge: which he was monthly to perform.

And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much,.... In
things natural, moral, divine, and spiritual, and that not slight and
superficial, but exceeding deep, and large beyond expression; and this
he had not from the acuteness of his genius merely, nor from his
industry and diligence; but by the gift of God, as whatsoever solid
wisdom and understanding is in any man, it is from the liberal hand of
God, the fountain of wisdom, [Jam 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#005.md);

and largeness of heart, even as sand that is on the seashore; he had a
genius and capacity to receive anything; his knowledge was vast and
comprehensive; it reached to and included things innumerable, as the
sand of the sea; there was scarce anything under the heavens, or on the
earth, and in the sea, but came within the compass of it, as what are
later mentioned show.

And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the
east,.... The Arabians, and Persians, famous for wisdom, and who lay to
the east of the land of Judea; whose wisdom lay in the knowledge of the
stars, in divination by birds, and soothsaying (m):

and all the wisdom of Egypt; which it was eminent for in the times of
Moses, and in which he was learned and well-skilled, [Act
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#022.md); and hence in later times the
philosophers of the Gentiles travelled to get knowledge, as Pherecydes,
Pythagoras, Anaxagoras, Plato, and others to Egypt, said to be the
mother of arts and sciences (n).

For he was wiser than all men,.... Not only that lived in his time, but
in ages past since the fall of Adam, and in times to come, especially in
natural wisdom and knowledge, in all the branches of it; for though some
men excel in some part of knowledge, yet not in all, as Solomon did:

than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of
Mahol; men of the same names are said to be sons of Zerah, grandson of
Judah, [Ch1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#006.md); wherefore these are
either other men, or their father had two names; or Mahol here may be an
appellative, and describe the character of these then, and point at what
they were famous for, as that they were sons of music, piping, and
dancing, as Mahol may signify; the Jews have a tradition (o), that Ethan
is Abraham, and Heman Moses, and Chalcol Joseph:

and his fame was in all nations round about; not for his riches and
grandeur only, but chiefly for his wisdom.

And he spake three thousand proverbs,.... Wise sayings, short and pithy
sentences, instructive in morality and civil life; these were not
written as the book of Proverbs, but spoken only, and were taken from
his lips, and spread by those that heard them for the use of others, but
in process of time were lost; whereas the above book, being written
under divine inspiration, is preserved: and

his songs were a thousand and five; some things that were useful to
improve the minds and morals of men he delivered in verse, to make them
more pleasant and agreeable, that they might be the more easily received
and retained in memory; but of all his songs, the most: excellent is the
book of Canticles, called "the Song of Songs", being divine and
spiritual, and dictated by the inspiration of the Spirit of God: he was
both a moral philosopher and poet, as well as a botanist and naturalist,
and well-skilled in medicine, as the following words suggest, [Kg1
4:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#033.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg1 4:33</span></span>

And he spake of trees,.... Of all trees, herbs, and plants, of the
nature, virtues, and use them:

from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon: a mountain on the northern
border of Judea, famous for cedars, the tallest and largest of trees:

even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall; which grew about
Jerusalem, and in the mountains of it, as an Arabic writes testifies
(p), the lowest and least herb; so that what is between the cedar and
hyssop include trees and plants of every kind and sort: whether the same
herb we call hyssop is meant, is not certain; some take it to be mint;
others marjoram; some houseleek; others the wallflower; Levinus Lemnius
(q) supposes it to be Adiantum, or maiden hair: the Targum interprets it
allegorically, that he prophesied of the kings of the house of David in
this world, and in the world to come of the Messiah:

he spake also of beasts, and of fowls, and of creeping things, and of
fishes; he understood the nature of all sorts of animals in the earth,
air, and sea, and discoursed of their names, kinds, qualities, and use,
with the greatest ease and perspicuity; the Jews fancy that Aristotle's
History of Animals is his, which that philosopher came upon, and
published it in his own name. Suidas (r) says it was reported that
Solomon wrote a book of medicines for all diseases, which was fixed to
the entrance of the temple, which Hezekiah took away, because sick
people applied to that for cure of their disorders, and neglected to
pray to God.

And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon,

from all kings of the earth,.... Who sent their ambassadors to his court
to know the truth of what was reported, and bring them some proofs and
specimens, by which they might judge of the truth of the relations that
had been told them; which perhaps might seem to them to be beyond all
belief:

which had heard of his wisdom; for the fame of it was spread everywhere
by merchants and travellers, and such sort of persons, who had been at
Jerusalem, and were masters of various anecdotes relating to Solomon;
which they industriously spread in the several parts of the world they
had dealings in.
