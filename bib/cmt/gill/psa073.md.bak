[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

INTRODUCTION TO PSALM 73

A Psalm of Asaph. It seems by the title that Asaph was the penman of
this psalm, as it is certain that he was a composer of psalms and hymns;
see [Ch2 29:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#030.md), though it may be
rendered, "a psalm for Asaph", or "unto Asaph" (a); and might have David
for its author, as some think, who, having penned it, sent it to Asaph,
to be made use of by him in public service; see [Ch1
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#007.md), and so the Targum paraphrases
it,

"a song by the hands of Asaph;''

the occasion of it was a temptation the psalmist fell into, through the
prosperity of the wicked, and the afflictions of the righteous, to think
there was nothing in religion, that it was a vain and useless thing;
under which he continued until he went into the house of God, and was
taught better; when he acknowledged his stupidity and folly, and penned
this psalm, to prevent others falling into the same snare, and to set
forth the goodness of God to his people, with which it begins.

[Psalms 73:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 73:1</span></span>

Truly God is good to Israel,.... To Israel, literally understood; in
choosing them to be his people above all people on earth; in bringing
them into a good land; in favouring them with many external privileges,
civil and religious; in giving them his word, statutes, and ordinances,
as he did not to other nations: or, spiritually understood, the Israel
whom God has chosen, redeemed, and called by his special grace; verily
of a truth, God is good to these; there is abundant proof and evidence
of it; See Gill on [Psa 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#008.md),

or "only" God is good to such; though he is good to all in a
providential way, yet only to his chosen and redeemed ones in a way of
special favour; the goodness others share is but a shadow of goodness,
in comparison of what they do and shall partake of; they are blessed
with blessings indeed, and are only blessed; so this particle is
rendered in [Psa 62:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#002.md), or "but", or
"notwithstanding" (b), God is good, &c. that is, though he suffers the
wicked to prosper, and his own people much afflicted, yet he is good to
them; he supports them under their afflictions, and makes all to work
for their good; gives them grace here, and glory hereafter;

even to such as are of a clean heart; this character excludes the carnal
Israelites, who were pure in their own eyes, but not cleansed from their
filthiness, and describes the true Israel of God, and explains who are
meant by them, such as are pure in heart, inwardly Jews, Israelites
indeed, in whom there is no guile; this is not natural to men, their
hearts are by nature unclean, nor is it in their power to make them
clean: this is God's work, he only can create a clean heart, and renew a
right spirit; which is done by the sanctifying influences of his grace,
and by the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus, and thus purifying their
heart's by faith; yet so as not to be free from all impurity of spirit,
but as to have a conscience purged from the guilt of sin, and to have
the heart sincere and upright towards God.

[Psalms 73:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 73:2</span></span>

But as for me,.... Who am one of the Israel of God whose heart has been
renewed and purified by the grace of God, and to whom he has been kind
and good in a thousand instances; yet, ungrateful creature that I am,

my feet were almost gone; out of the good ways of God, the ways of truth
and holiness just upon the turn, ready to forsake them, and give up all
religion as a vain thing:

my steps had well nigh slipped, or "poured out" (c) like water; the
allusion is to standing on wet and slippery ground, where a man can
scarcely keep upon his feet. It may be observed, that good men are
liable to slips and falls, to fall into sin, snares, and temptations,
and from their steadfastness in the faith, but not totally and finally;
their feet may be "almost", but not "altogether", gone: their steps may
"well nigh" slip, but not "quite"; they may fall, but not be utterly
cast down; at least they rise again, and are made to stand; for God is
able to keep them, and does keep them, from a total and final falling
away.

[Psalms 73:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 73:3</span></span>

For I was envious at the foolish,.... The atheists, as in [Psa
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md), who deny the creation, as Arama;
the wicked, as after explained, as all wicked men are, how wise soever
they may be in things natural and civil, yet in religious things, in
things of a spiritual nature, they have no understanding; they are proud
boasters, glory in themselves, and in their outward attainments, as the
word (d) here used signifies; the external happiness of these, their
riches, health, and ease, were envied by the psalmist; see [Psa
37:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#001.md),

when I saw the prosperity of the wicked, or "the peace of the wicked"
(e); with an evil eye. This was the occasion of his slip and fall, this
was the temptation he was left unto for a while.

glorious fools", Ainsworth. (e) "pacem", Pagninus, Musculus, Piscator.

[Psalms 73:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 73:4</span></span>

For there are no bands in their death,.... Nothing that binds and
straitens them, afflicts and distresses them; they have no pain of mind
nor of body, but die at once, suddenly, in a moment, wholly at ease and
quiet, without any bitterness of soul; see [Job
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#013.md), or "there are no bands until
their death" (f); they have no straits nor difficulties all their life
long, no distempers nor diseases which may be called "bonds", [Luk
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#012.md), till they come to die: the
Vulgate Latin version is, "there is no respect to their death"; they
take no notice of it, they have no care or concern about it; or, as the
Targum,

"they are not terrified nor troubled because of the day of their
death;''

they put it away far from them, and think nothing about it: but their
strength is firm; they are hale and robust, healthful and sound, to the
day of their death; their strength is not weakened in the way by
diseases and distempers. Some take the word rendered "strength" to
signify a porch or palace, and translate it, they are strong as a
palace, or in a palace, or their palace is strong (g) their houses are
well built, and continue long.

\(f\) "usque ad mortem eorum", Junius & Tremellius, Piscator, Gejerus,
Michaelis. (g) "palatium vel sicut palatium"; so some in Piscator;
"porticus", Schmidt; so R. Jonah, Arama, and Jerom.

[Psalms 73:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 73:5</span></span>

They are not in trouble, as other men,.... Either of body or of mind, as
the saints are, who through many tribulations enter the kingdom; or are
not in "labour" (h), do not labour for food and raiment, or get their
bread by the sweat of their brow, as poor men do; nor are weary, so
Arama: "neither are they plagued like other men"; smitten of God,
corrected, and chastised by him, as his children are; the rod of God is
not upon them, [Job 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#009.md).

\(h\) "in labore", V. L. Pagninus, Montanus, Musculus, Junius &
Tremellius, Gejerus.

[Psalms 73:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 73:6</span></span>

Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain, Which was the sin of
the devils, and of our first parents, and of Sodom, and is the sin of
antichrist; and which, of all sins, is most hateful to God; this arises
from, at least is increased by, outward prosperity. Jeshurun waxed fat
and kicked; pride and fulness of bread went together in Sodom; and,
where it is predominant, it binds as a chain; such who are under the
power of it are slaves unto it, they are chained and fettered by it, and
it possesses them wholly; it shows itself in the several members of
their bodies, in their eyes and feet, their walk and gait, and in their
conduct and behaviour, and in the several actions of their lives, and is
rightly called "the pride of life"; or rather they bind it about
themselves as a chain, fancying it to be an ornament to them, what sets
them off, and makes them look great in the eyes of others; whereas the
reverse is what is of great price, and in high esteem with God and good
men; namely, the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit:

violence covereth them as a garment; wicked men that are prosperous and
proud are generally oppressive to others; and are very often open in
their acts of violence, which are as openly done and to be seen of all
men, as the clothes upon their backs; and frequently the clothes they
wear are got by rapine and oppression, so that they may properly be
called garments of violence; see [Isa
59:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#006.md).

[Psalms 73:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 73:7</span></span>

Or their face, the eyes being put for the whole face; so the Targum,

"their face is changed, because of fatness;''

see [Job 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#027.md), otherwise through
fatness the eyes are almost enclosed: or "it goes forth out of the
fatness of their eyes" (i); that is, either "pride", which shows itself
in haughty looks and scornful airs, through the abundance possessed; or
"violence", seen in the fierceness of the eyes, and fury of the
countenance; or "their eyes go out through fatness" (k) that is, through
the plenty they enjoy, their eyes go out in lust after lawful objects:

they have more than heart could wish; that they themselves could have
wished for heretofore, though not now; for what is it that a worldly
covetous heart cannot and does not wish for? if it had all the world, it
would not satisfy it: or "the imaginations of the heart go on" (l); that
is, after more, not being content with such things as they have; or
"they", i.e. their pride and violence,

exceed the imaginations of the heart (m); they are more than can be
conceived of, they overpass the deeds of the wicked, [Jer
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#028.md) or "they transgress by the
imaginations of the heart" (n); which are evil, and that continually.

\(i\) "prodit vel exit e pinguedine oculorum eorum", Michaelis. (k)
"Exivit prae adipe oculus eorum", Montanus; "egreditur prae pinguedine",
Gejerus. (l) "pergunt cogitationes cordis eorum", Piscator. (m)
"Excesserunt imaginationes cordis", Cocceius; "excedunt", Michaelis. (n)

[Psalms 73:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 73:8</span></span>

They are corrupt,.... In themselves, in their principles, and in their
practices, being shapen and conceived in sin, and born of the flesh; and
are corrupters, or "corrupt" themselves, and their ways, and also others
by their corrupt speech, evil communications, and bad examples: or "they
consume away"; like smoke, or into it, as [Psa
37:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#020.md) or as wax melteth at the fire,
[Psa 68:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#002.md), where the same word is used
as here: or "they cause to consume away" (o); "they melt or dissolve
others"; they consume them, and waste their estates by their oppression
and violence; they make their hearts to melt with their threatening and
terrifying words; or they make them dissolute in their lives by keeping
them company:

and speak wickedly concerning oppression; they speak oppression and
revolt, threaten with it, [Isa 59:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#013.md),
and speak in vindication of it, and in a boasting glorying manner; so
Arama; which is speaking wickedly concerning it:

they speak loftily: proudly, arrogantly, in a haughty and imperious
manner: or "from on high" (p); as if they were in heaven, and above all
creatures, and even God himself; and as if what they said were oracles,
and to be received as such, without any scruple and hesitation. Thus
Pharaoh, Sennacherib, and Nebuchadnezzar spake, [Exo
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#002.md) and the little horn, or
antichrist, [Dan 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#020.md).

[Psalms 73:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 73:9</span></span>

They set their mouth against the heavens,.... Against God in heaven, see
[Dan 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#026.md), against his being, saying,
there is no God; against his perfections, thinking him to be such an one
as themselves; against his purposes and decrees, replying against him,
and charging him with insincerity, cruelty, and unrighteousness; and
against his providence, either denying it, or affirming it to be
unequal; and against his doctrines, ordinances, and ministers. Aben Ezra
interprets it also of the angels of heaven, who are spoken against, when
it is denied that there are any such beings, as were by the Sadducees;
and blasphemed, when the worshipping of them is introduced. The Targum
understands it of the saints of heaven, with which compare [Rev
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#006.md) it may be applied to civil
magistrates, the higher powers, who represent on earth God in heaven;
and there are some that despise dominion, and speak evil of such
dignities:

and their tongue walketh through the earth: sparing none, high nor low,
but injures all sorts of persons with their lies and calumnies. This
denotes the unbridled liberty which wicked men take with their tongues;
there is no restraint upon them, no stopping of them; see [Psa
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#005.md) the universal mischief they are
continually doing, and the diabolical influence of their detraction and
falsehood; like Satan, their tongues walk to and fro in the earth, doing
all the injury to the credit and characters of men they possibly can.

[Psalms 73:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 73:10</span></span>

Therefore his people return hither,.... Either the true people of God,
and so the Targum, the people of the Lord, and whom the psalmist owned
for his people; for the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic, and
Ethiopic versions, read "my people"; who seeing the prosperity of the
wicked, and feeling their own afflictions, return to the same way of
thinking, and fall by the same snare and temptation as the psalmist did;
or such who were only the people of God by profession, but hypocrites,
who observing the trouble that attends a religious life, and the
prosperity of wicked men, return from the good ways of God they have
outwardly walked in for some time, to the conversation of these men, and
join themselves to them: or else, "his" being put for "their", the sense
is, the people of these wicked men, of everyone of them, return unto
them, and flock about them, and caress and flatter them, because of
their prosperous circumstances, and join with them in their evil
practices of oppression and slander; which sense seems best to agree
with what goes before and follows after:

and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them; meaning either to the
people of God, and to be understood either of the abundance of their
tears, on account of their afflictions inward and outward; see [Psa
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#006.md), so the Targum,

"and many tears flow unto them;''

or of their afflictions themselves, which are oftentimes compared to
waters in Scripture; see [Psa 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#007.md),
which are given them in measure: it is a cup of them that is put into
their hands, and in full measure; they have a full cup of them; many are
their tribulations, through which they enter the kingdom, and they are
all of God; it is he that wrings them out to them with his fatherly
hand: or else, taking the people to mean the followers and companions of
the wicked, the words are to be understood of the plenty of good things
which such men enjoy in this life, their cup runs over; and indeed these
seem to be the persons who are introduced speaking the following words.

[Psalms 73:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 73:11</span></span>

And they say, how doth God know?.... Owning there is a God, but
questioning his knowledge; for the words are not an inquiry about the
way and manner of his knowing things; which is not by the senses, as
hearing and seeing; eyes and ears are improperly ascribed to him; nor in
a discursive way, by reasoning, and inferring one thing from another;
for he knows things intuitively, beholding all things in his own eternal
mind and will: but they are a question about his knowledge itself, as
follows:

and is their knowledge in the most High? they acknowledge God to be the
most High, and yet doubt whether there is knowledge in him; and indeed
the higher with respect to place, and at the greater distance he was
from them, the less they imagined he knew of affairs below; see [Job
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#013.md) for the knowledge called in
question is to be understood of his providential notice of human
affairs, which they thought he did not concern himself with, as being
below his regard; see [Eze 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#009.md) and
therefore concluded that their acts of oppression and violence, and
their insolent words against God and men, would pass unobserved, and
with impunity. If these are the words of good men, of the people of God
under affliction, they are to be considered as under a temptation from
their affliction, and the prosperity of the wicked, to call in question
the providence of God in the government of the world, and his love to
them, which is sometimes expressed by his knowledge of them, [Psa
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#006.md).

[Psalms 73:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 73:12</span></span>

Behold, these are the ungodly,.... Who say and do as before declared;
such as these must be without the knowledge of God, the fear, love, and
worship of him: who prosper in the world; in worldly and temporal
things, in their bodies and outward estates, but not in their souls and
spiritual things: "in this world", as the Targum is; all their
prosperity is here; their good things are in this life, their evil
things will be in that to come; though ungodly, they prosper in the
world, and as long as they are in it; or they are at peace and in case,
and are quiet; they have nothing to disturb them, they are not in
outward trouble, and their sins do not distress them, and they have no
concern about another world:

they increase in riches; which they are in the pursuit of, and overtake
and enjoy in great abundance; whereby they become mighty and powerful,
as the word (o) for "riches" signifies: these words are the observation
of the psalmist, and which was the occasion of the following temptation
he was led into.

\(o\) "vires", Junius & Tremellius; "potentiam", Piscator.

[Psalms 73:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 73:13</span></span>

Verily, I have cleansed my heart in vain,.... Which supposes that his
heart had been unclean, as every man's is, and which appears by what is
in it, and by what comes out of it; that it was now cleansed, not in an
absolute and legal sense, as if it was wholly free from sin, for this no
man can say; but in an evangelical sense, being purified by faith in the
blood of Christ; that he had himself some concern in the cleansing of
his heart, which seems to be contrary to [Pro
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#009.md) and besides, this is the Lord's
own work, [Psa 51:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#010.md) wherefore this
may be considered as a wrong and rash expression of his; for as he was
wrong in one part of it, its being cleansed in vain, so he might be in
the other, in ascribing it to himself; though it may be allowed,
consistent with what is before observed, that a believer has a concern
in the cleansing of his heart; for, being convinced of the impurity of
it, he owns and laments it before the Lord; and, seeing the fountain of
the Redeemer's blood opened, he applies to it, and to him for cleansing;
and expresses a love unto, a great and studious concern for purity of
heart as well as life; and, under the influence of divine grace, is
enabled to keep a watch over it, whereby, through the same grace, it is
preserved from much pollution; and by fresh application to the blood of
Christ, is cleansed from what it daily contracts:

and washed my hands in innocency: that is, "in vain", as before; which
denotes the performance of good works, a course of holy life and
conversation, which when right springs from purity of heart; See Gill on
[Psa 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#006.md), now the psalmist under
temptation concluded that all his religion and devotion were in vain,
all his hearing, and reading, and attending on ordinances, all his
concern for purity of heart and life; since those who showed no regard
to these things prospered in the world, and increased in riches,
abounded in ease and plenty, and seemed to be rather the favourites of
heaven than religious men; and this temptation was strengthened by the
following observation.

[Psalms 73:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 73:14</span></span>

For all the day long have I been plagued,.... "Smitten or scourged" (p),
as in [Psa 73:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#005.md), that is, afflicted of
God; which is no ways inconsistent with his love, nor with his covenant,
nor with an interest in him, as a covenant God and Father; see [Psa
89:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#029.md),

and chastened every morning; not in wrath, but in love, and for good;
not with the chastisement of a cruel one, but of a loving and tender
father; and therefore not to be improved in such a manner, as if on this
account there was nothing in religion; whereas the daily notices the
Lord takes of his people this way show his regard unto them, and care of
them.

\(p\) "flagellatus", V. L. Pagninus, Montanus; "percussus", Gejerus.

[Psalms 73:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 73:15</span></span>

If I say, I will speak thus,.... Either as the wicked do, [Psa
73:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#008.md) or rather as he had thought in
his own mind, [Psa 73:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#013.md), wherefore he
kept it all to himself, and did not make known to others the reasonings
of his mind, and the temptations he laboured under:

behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children; of whom
care should be taken, above all things, that they be not offended, [Mat
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#006.md), or "should condemn"; as the
Targum; or as Jarchi,

"I should make them transgressors, and wicked persons;''

should represent them as if they were men hated and rejected of God,
because of their afflictions: the words may be rendered, "behold the
generation of thy children, I have transgressed" (q); by giving way to
the above temptation, which might have been prevented by considering the
church, children, and people of God, and the care he has taken of them,
the regard he has shown to them, and the preservation of them in all
ages. The words are an apostrophe to God, who has children by adopting
grace, and which appear so by their regeneration; and there is a
generation of them in all ages; when one goes, another comes; there is
always a seed, a spiritual offspring, to serve him, which is counted for
a generation.

\(q\) "ecce generatio filiorum tuorum, praevaricatus sum", Pagninus,

[Psalms 73:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 73:16</span></span>

When I thought to know this,.... How to reconcile the prosperity of the
wicked, and the afflictions of the righteous, to the perfections of God,
and his wise providence in the government of the world, by the mere dint
of reason, without consulting the sacred oracles, or his own and others'
experience:

it was too painful for me: too laborious and toilsome, a work he was not
equal to; "hic labor, hoc opus"; see [Ecc
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#017.md).

[Psalms 73:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 73:17</span></span>

Until I went into the sanctuary of God,.... The tabernacle or house of
God, where the Word of God was read and explained, prayer was made, and
sacrifices offered up, and where fellowship was had with the saints, and
communion with God himself; which for one hour or moment is preferable
to all the prosperity of the wicked, during their whole life. This shows
that though the psalmist was beset with the temptation, yet not
overcome; it did not so far prevail as to cause him to neglect public
worship, and relinquish the house of God, and the ordinances of it; and
it is right, under temptations, doubts, and difficulties, to attend the
public ministrations, which is the way and means to have relief under
temptations, to have doubts resolved, and difficulties removed: some by
"the sanctuary of God" understand the Scriptures, which are holy and of
God, and are profitable for instruction, and are to be consulted and
entered into by a serious reading of and deep meditation on them;
whereby may be known the happiness that is prepared for the saints in
the other world, and the misery of the wicked, and hereby judgment may
be made of the present case and condition of each: others interpret it
of the world of spirits, which may be entered into by contemplation;
when it may be observed that the spirits of just men upon their
dissolution possess unspeakable joys and glories, and the souls of the
wicked are in inconceivable torments:

then understood I their end; both of the godly and of the wicked; that
the end of the righteous is peace, rest, salvation, and eternal life,
and the end of the wicked is ruin, destruction, and death; see [Psa
37:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#035.md).

[Psalms 73:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 73:18</span></span>

Surely thou didst set them in slippery places,.... In which a man cannot
stand long, and without danger; and the higher they are the more
dangerous, being slippery, and such are places of honour and riches. The
phrase denotes the uncertainty and instability of these things, and the
danger men are in who are possessed of them of falling into destruction
and misery. The Targum is,

"thou didst set them in darkness;''

to be in slippery places, and in the dark, is very uncomfortable,
unsafe, and dangerous indeed; See [Psa
35:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#006.md) and it may be observed, that all
this honour, promotion, and riches, are of God; it is he that sets them
in these places of honour and profit; and he that sets them up can pull
them down, as he does; so it follows,

thou castest them down into destruction: into temporal destruction, by
removing them from their high stations into a very low, mean, and
contemptible state, as were Shebna and Nebuchadnezzar, [Isa
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#015.md) and into everlasting
destruction, from whence there is no recovery; see [Psa
55:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#023.md).

[Psalms 73:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 73:19</span></span>

How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment?.... Very suddenly,
which is often the case of wicked men, who cry Peace and safety, and
sudden destruction comes upon them, [Th1
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#003.md), so as in a moment were the
punishment of Sodom and Gomorrah, of Pharaoh and his host, and of Korah
and his company, [Lam 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#006.md), the words
are expressed with admiration, as wondering at the sudden and amazing
turn of things:

they are utterly consumed with terrors: their destruction is not only
sudden, but entire; it is like the breaking in pieces of a potter's
vessel; a shard of which cannot be gathered up and used, or like the
casting of a millstone into the sea, which will never rise more; such
will be the destruction of antichrist; see [Rev
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#027.md) and this is done "with terrors";
either by terrible judgments inflicted on them from without; or with
terrors inwardly seizing upon their minds and consciences; as, at the
time of temporal calamities, or at death, however at judgment, when the
awful sentence will be pronounced upon them; see [Job
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#020.md).

[Psalms 73:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 73:20</span></span>

As a dream when one awaketh,.... So will be all the temporal felicity of
wicked men, all an illusion, all a dream; when they lift up their eyes
in hell, and awake in the resurrection, they will find themselves
destitute of all their riches and honours, and it will be as if they had
only dreamed of them, and never enjoyed them; see [Job
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#006.md) so, "O Lord, when thou awakest";
to judgment, to take vengeance on wicked men, and vindicate his own
people; and who seems sometimes to be as it were asleep, and to take no
notice of things, when the judgment of the ungodly, and their damnation,
seem to slumber, though it does not; see [Psa
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#006.md) or when he awakes the dead at the
time of the resurrection. Death is often compared to sleep in Scripture,
and the resurrection to an awaking out of it, which is the Lord's work,
[Isa 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#019.md), and so the Targum,

"O Lord, when thou shalt raise them from their graves:''

thou shalt despise their image; the image of the earthly man, of sin and
of Satan, which is upon both their souls and bodies; which will both be
destroyed in hell: or their riches and honour, the vain show in which
they have walked, their outward pomp and splendour; which was only a
show, an outward appearance, and no solidity and substance; and which
will not be esteemed in the great day of account, but despised; see [Job
36:18](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#018.md), the wicked will awake, and
arise to everlasting shame and contempt, [Dan
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002.md).

[Psalms 73:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 73:21</span></span>

Thus my heart was grieved,.... Not with his own sins, nor with the sins
of the wicked, but at their prosperity; for this is an account of
himself, while under the temptation, and before he went into the
sanctuary of the Lord; or when he was "leavened" (r), with the old
leaven of wickedness, and envy, and indignation; he was in a ferment, so
Plautus (s) uses the phrase for being in anger and wrath; he swelled, as
what is leavened does, against God and his providence: or was "soured"
(t); he was out of humour and angry with God, or was exasperated and
provoked at the favours bestowed upon the wicked. Some render it
"inflamed" (u), made hot; not with the love of God, and meditation upon
it, but with wrath and indignation:

and I was pricked in my reins; disturbed and distracted in his thoughts,
felt a great deal of pain in his mind, while he was considering the
prosperity of the wicked; which was as a sword in his bones, and as an
arrow shot into his reins; see [Lam
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#013.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 73:22</span></span>

So foolish was I,.... To envy the prosperity of the wicked, which is of
so short a continuance; to arraign the providence and perfections of
God, and to conclude so hastily that there was nothing in religion:

and ignorant; or, "I knew not" (w); what he attempted to know, [Psa
73:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#016.md), nor the end of the wicked, till
he went into the sanctuary of the Lord; nor the counsel and design of
God, in his methods of providence towards wicked men:

I was as a beast before thee, or "with thee" (x); in the knowledge of
the ways and works of God, even those of providence; see [Psa
92:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#005.md), unteachable, untractable,
kicking against God and his providential dispensations; not behaving
like a man, much, less like a saint; but even as the worst of brutes, as
the behemoth in [Job 40:15](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#015.md), for the
same word is here used; he concluded that God, who saw all the
wickedness of his heart, the workings and reasonings of his mind, which
were so vain and foolish, could esteem him no other than as a beast; so
the Targum,

"as a beast I am accounted with thee:''

the words may be rendered, "I was the veriest beast before thee"; there
being no note of similitude in the text; the word for "beast" being in
the plural number, may be used for a superlative; Plautus (y) uses the
word "bellua", beast, for a stupid man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 73:23</span></span>

Nevertheless, I am continually with thee,.... Upon the heart of God, in
his hands, under his eye, under his wings of protection and care, and
not suffered to depart from him finally and totally; he could not be
disunited and removed from him by the above temptation; nor was he left
to cast off the fear of the Lord, and to forsake his worship and
service; nor altogether to lose his love and affection for him, which
still continued; see [Psa 73:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#025.md), or "I
shall be always with thee" (z); not now, for though the saints are
always in union with the Lord, yet they have not always communion with
him; but hereafter, in heaven, to all eternity:

thou hast holden me by my right hand; as an instance of condescension,
respect, and familiarity; see [Act
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#019.md), as a parent takes his child by
the hand, and learns it to go, so the Lord takes his children by the
hand, and teaches them to walk by faith in him, [Hos
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#003.md) or in order to keep them from
falling, and bear them up under temptations and exercises; as well as to
lead them into more intimate communion with himself in his sanctuary,
and to raise them up out of their low estate to an exalted one; see [Isa
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001.md), and likewise to put something
into their hands, to supply their wants, and fill them with his good
things; see [Eze 16:49](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#049.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">psa 73:24</span></span>

Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel,.... Which is wise and prudent,
wholesome, suitable, and seasonable, hearty, sincere, and faithful, and
which is freely given, and when taken, infallibly succeeds: or
"according to thy counsel" (a); the determinate counsels, purposes, and
will of God, which were of old faithfulness and truth; who does all
things after the counsel of his own will in providence and grace: or "by
thy counsel" (b); by the Scriptures of truth, the revealed word, which
contains the will of God, and directions for a holy walk and
conversation; by the Gospel and truths of it, called the whole counsel
of God, [Act 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#027.md), and by his Holy
Spirit, which is a spirit of counsel as well as of might; and by which
the Lord guides his people in the ways of peace, truth, righteousness,
and holiness, through this world, to the heavenly glory, as follows:

and afterward receive me to glory; into a glorious place, an house not
made with hands, a city whose builder and maker is God, into a kingdom
and glory, or a glorious kingdom; and into glorious company, the company
of Father, Son, and Spirit, angels and glorified saints, where glorious
things will be seen, and a glory enjoyed both in soul and body to all
eternity; for this glory is eternal glory, a glory that passes not away:
or "in glory" (c); in a glorious manner: some render it, "after glory
thou wilt receive me" (d); that is, after all the glory and honour thou
hast bestowed upon me here, thou wilt take me to thyself in heaven; so
the Targum,

"after the glory is completed, which thou saidst thou wouldst bring upon
me, thou wilt receive me:''

but rather the sense is, "after" thou hast led and guided me by thy
counsel through the wilderness of this world; "after" all the
afflictions and temptations of this present life are over; "after" I
have passed through the valley of the shadow of death, or "after" death
itself, thou wilt receive me into everlasting joy and happiness; see
[Pe1 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#010.md).

[Psalms 73:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 73:25</span></span>

Whom have I in heaven but thee,.... Which includes God the Father, Son,
and Spirit; God the Father, as his only covenant God and Father; Christ
as his only Mediator, Saviour, and Redeemer, Head, Husband, Advocate,
and Intercessor; the Spirit as his only sanctifier, Comforter, earnest,
and sealer; and is expressive of their being the one and only Lord God,
the sole object of worship, trust, and confidence; his only helper and
guide; and in whom his supreme happiness and glory lay; and it excludes
the sun, moon, and stars, in the lower heavens, from being the object of
worship and trust; and angels and glorified saints in the highest
heavens: the words may be rendered, "who is for me in heaven?" (e) on my
side, my protector and defender; see [Rom
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#031.md).

and there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee; or "with thee"
(f); there are many things on earth desirable, as riches, health,
friends, food, raiment, &c. but not to be compared with God and Christ,
and the blessed Spirit; with the love of God, the grace of Christ, and
the communion of the Holy Ghost; there are none to be loved and
delighted in as they, nor anything so desirable as fellowship with them:
or "with thee I desire not the earth" (g); the whole world, and all
things in it, are nothing in comparison of God; if a man was possessed
of the whole of it, and had not interest in the Lord, he would be
miserable; and if he has an interest in him, he has enough without it;
for all things are his, God is all in all; wherefore he is willing to
leave all, and be with him for ever: the Targum is,

"who is like unto thee, that is, mine in heaven but thee? and with thee
I do not desire a companion on earth.''

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">psa 73:26</span></span>

My flesh and my heart faileth,.... Either through vehement desires of
communion with God deferred, see [Psa
84:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#002.md) or through afflictive
dispensations of Providence, being smitten and chastened continually,
[Psa 73:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#014.md), or through inward trials
and exercises, by reason of indwelling sin, temptations, and desertions:
or rather the words are expressive of the body being emaciated by
sickness and diseases; and the heart fainting through fear of death, or
rather failing at it, being at the point of death; the heart being, as
philosophers say, the first that lives, and the last that dies:

but God is the strength of my heart, or "the rock of my heart" (h); when
overwhelmed with distress through outward trouble, or in the lowest
condition with respect to spiritual things; when grace is weak,
corruptions strong, temptations prevail, and afflictions are many; then
does the Lord support and sustain his people, and strengthens them with
strength in their souls; and in the moment of death, by showing them
that its sting is taken away, and its curse removed; that their souls
are going to their Lord, and about to enter into his joy; and that their
bodies will rise again glorious and incorruptible:

and my portion for ever; both in life and at death, and to all eternity;
this is a very large portion indeed; such who have it inherit all
things; yea, it is immense and inconceivable; it is a soul satisfying
one, and is safe and secure; it can never be taken away, nor can it be
spent; it will last always; see [Psa
142:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#005.md).

For, lo, they that are far from thee,.... Who are alienated from the
life of God, far from the law of God, and subjection and obedience to
it; and from righteousness either moral or evangelical, and from the
love and fear of God, and worship of him:

shall perish; not merely at death, as even righteous men do, but be lost
eternally:

thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee; that follow
after other gods, and worship them; which is spiritual adultery and
fornication, the Scriptures often speak of, and intend by it idolatry;
see [Deu 31:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#016.md) or who set their hearts
and affections upon the creature, and have them alienated from God; and
love the creature more and besides the Creator: the past tense seems to
be put for the future, and so some render it, "thou shalt destroy", or
"cut off" (i); destroy them soul and body, and punish them with an
everlasting destruction in hell; the Targum is,

"that wander from thy fear;''

that is, from the worship of God.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">psa 73:28</span></span>

But it is good for me to draw near to God,.... In prayer, and other acts
of religious worship; to attend the word and ordinances in the
sanctuary, where the psalmist had lately been delivered out of a sore
temptation, and so had a recent experience, which was fresh in his mind,
of the advantages of such exercises; for it is both an honourable good,
what is becoming and commendable, and a pleasant good, what yields
delight and satisfaction, and a profitable good, to draw nigh to God by
Christ, the new and living way, assisted by the Holy Spirit; which, when
done aright, is with faith, sincerity, reverence, and a holy boldness:

I have put my trust in the Lord God; as the rock of his refuge and
salvation, as his portion and inheritance:

that I may declare all thy works; of providence and grace, by
proclaiming the wisdom, power, goodness, and faithfulness of God in
them; by giving him the glory of them, and by expressing thankfulness
for them, both by words and deeds.
