INTRODUCTION TO DEUTERONOMY 20

In this chapter rules are given to be observed in times of war. When a
battle was near, a priest was to address the soldiers, and encourage
them to fight, [Deu 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#001.md), then the
officers were to declare who might return home, [Deu
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#005.md) when an enemy's city was
approached, peace was to be proclaimed on certain conditions, which, if
accepted of, the inhabitants were to be tributaries and servants, but if
not, when taken, all were to be put to the sword, excepting women,
children, and cattle, [Deu 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#010.md), but
those of the seven nations were to be utterly destroyed, [Deu
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#016.md), and, during a siege, no trees
bearing fruit fit for food were to be cut down, [Deu
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#019.md).

[Deuteronomy 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 20:1</span></span>

When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies,.... There were two
sorts of war the Israelites were engaged in, one commanded and another
permitted, as Maimonides (c) distinguishes; one was by the order and
appointment of God, as against the seven nations of Canaan; the other
was voluntary and arbitrary, which was left to their own discretion and
will, as they saw fit, when they were provoked or distressed, or were
invaded by their enemies, or they saw reason to go out against them, and
either act the offensive or defensive part, or both; and of each of
these some things are said in this chapter:

and seest horses and chariots, and a people more than thou; the
Israelites had no horses, and so no chariots, their armies were all
infantry; but their neighbouring nations that made war with them had a
large cavalry, and multitudes of chariots, which made them very
formidable; thus Shishak, king of Egypt, in the times of Rehoboam, came
against Jerusalem with 1200 chariots and 60,000, horsemen, and people
without number; and Zerah the Ethiopian, in the times of Asa, came
against him with an host of 100,000 men, and three hundred chariots,
[Ch2 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#002.md).

be not afraid of them; because of the strength of their cavalry, the
terrible approaches of their chariots, and the number of their men:

for the Lord thy God is with thee; hence, as Hezekiah says, more would
be with them than with their enemies, with whom was an arm of flesh, but
with them the Lord their God, [Ch2
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#007.md) and so the Targum of
Jonathan,"for all of them shall be reckoned as one horse and one chariot
before the Lord your God;''with whom numbers are nothing; and which
adds,"for his Word shall be your help;''the eternal Logos, or Word of
God; so Onkelos; and if God and his Word, his only begotten Son, are on
the side of his people, they have nothing to fear from enemies, though
ever so many and mighty:

which brought thee out of the land of Egypt; which is observed for the
encouragement of their faith and confidence in him; for he that did that
for them, what is it he cannot or will not do?

\(c\) Hilchot Melachim, c. 7. sect. 1.

[Deuteronomy 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 20:2</span></span>

When all things are preparing for it, and it seems unavoidable:

that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people; not any
priest, but one appointed for this service; who is called

the anointed of war, as Jarchi and Aben Ezra observe, and concerning
whom Maimonides (d) is more particular; he says,"they appoint a priest
to speak to the people at the time of war, and they anoint him with the
anointing oil, and he is called the anointed of war; twice the anointed
of war speaks unto the people, once in a book at the time they go forth,
before they set in battle array, he says to the people, "what man is
there", &c. and when he has caused his words to be heard, he returns; at
another time, when they are set in array, he says, "fear not", &c.''this
man seems to be an emblem of Gospel ministers, who are anointed with the
gifts and graces of the Spirit of God, and whose business it is to
encourage the people of God to fight the Lord's battles against sin,
Satan, and the world, and not to be afraid of their spiritual enemies;
directing them to take to them the whole armour of God, and to endure
hardness as good soldiers of Christ, to follow him the captain of their
salvation, assuring them of victory through him who makes them more than
conquerors, and that their warfare is or shortly will be accomplished.

\(d\) Hilchot Melachim, c. 7. sect. 1, 2.

[Deuteronomy 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 20:3</span></span>

And shall say unto them, hear, O Israel,.... Exciting their attention to
what he was about to say, and which, as Jarchi observes, was spoken in
the holy tongue, or in the Hebrew language:

you approach this day unto battle against your enemies; were marching or
ready to march, preparing to engage with them, and a battle seemed near
at hand:

let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye
terrified because of them; many words are made use of to animate them
against those fears which the strength, number, and appearance of their
enemies, would be apt to cause in them. Jarchi observes, that here are
four exhortations, answerable to four things which the kings of the
nations do (in order to inject terror into their enemies); they shake
their shields, to clash them one against another, that hearing their
noise they may be afraid of them and flee; they prance their horses, and
make them neigh, to cause the noise of the hoofs of their horses to be
heard; they shout with their voices, and blow with their trumpets: and
accordingly these several clauses are so interpreted in the Misnah
(e)""and let not your hearts faint"; at the neighing of the horses, and
the brightness of swords: "fear not"; at the clashing of shields: "and
do not tremble"; at the sound of trumpets: "neither be ye terrified" at
the voice of shouting;''and no doubt but it takes in everything that has
a tendency to cause fear, faintness, and dismay, which they are
cautioned against.

\(e\) Misn. Sotah, c. 8. sect. 1.

[Deuteronomy 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 20:4</span></span>

For the Lord your God is he that goeth with you,.... To battle, and
therefore they had no reason to fear and be dismayed, to be
fainthearted, terrified, and tremble:

fear not, I am with thee,.... [Isa
41:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#010.md), this, according to the Misnah
(f), respects the ark, and so Jarchi, which was a symbol of the divine
Presence, and went with them to battle; see [Jos
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#004.md).

to fight for you against your enemies, to save you; to annoy and destroy
the one, and to protect and save the other; thus far the anointed priest
addressed the people in an oration to this purpose: the account
Maimonides gives of it is, that"when they have set their ranks, and are
near to a battle, the anointed of war stands on an high place, and all
the ranks before him, and says to them in the holy tongue, "hear, O
Israel", &c. unto to save you; and then another priest under him causes
it to be heard by all the people with an high voice (g);''he repeated
what the anointed of war had said, and expressed it with a loud voice,
that all might hear.

\(f\) Ut supra. (Misn. Sotab, c. 8. sect. 1.) (g) Hilchot Melachim, c.
7. sect. 3.

[Deuteronomy 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 20:5</span></span>

And the officers shall speak unto the people,.... What these officers
were is not easy to say; they seem not to be officers of the army, for
they are distinguished from captains of the armies, [Deu
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#009.md), unless they can be thought to be
general officers; but the word for them is the same that is used of such
that attended the judges and were ministers to them, [Deu
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#018.md), and perhaps they were a sort of
heralds that published and proclaimed what the anointed of war had said;
and so the above writer (h) affirms, that what here follows was first
spoken by him, and after that (what is said, [Deu
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#003).md) the anointed of war speaks,
saying:

what man is there,.... (to the end of [Deu
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#007).md) thus far the anointed of war
speaks, and then an officer causes all the people to hear it with an
high voice, saying:

what man is there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated
it? or perfected it, as the Targum of Jonathan, not quite finished it,
has not, as that paraphrast says, fixed in it the door posts, or rather
perhaps he means the Mezuzah, or writing, which the Jews thought
themselves obliged to fasten to the door posts of their houses; see [Deu
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#020.md) until this was done, an house
was not thought to be completed; though Jarchi interprets this of
inhabitation; of a man's having built a house, but has not yet dwelt in
it; see [Deu 28:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#030), so Josephus (i.md)
explains it, of its not having been used and enjoyed by a man a full
year; but there seems to be something more than all this in dedication;
for though it does not signify a consecration or dedication of it to
holy uses, as the dedication of the tabernacle and temple, yet there was
something done, some ceremony used at entrance into a new house; a good
man entered into it, no doubt, with prayer and praise, as the thirtieth
psalm was composed by David at the dedication of his house; see [Neh
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#027.md) and perhaps it was usual to have
their friends together, and make a cheerful entertainment on the
occasion. Ben Melech on the place, assures us it was a custom to make a
feast and merriment at eating the first meal in a new house:

let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and
another man dedicate it; or perfect it, as the above Targum, or dwell in
it, as well as have the pleasure of entertaining his friends in it at
the first opening of it; this was either a command, enjoining a man, in
such a circumstance, to return, and so the rest that follow, or a
permission to him, allowing him to do it if he thought fit.

[Deuteronomy 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 20:6</span></span>

And what man is he that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not yet eaten
of it?.... Which he has a right to do, and it is hard for him to be
deprived of it, [Co1 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#007.md) or "hath not
made it common" (k); according to the law in [Lev
19:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#023.md). Three years the fruit of trees,
and so of vines, might not be eaten; in the fourth, they were devoted to
the Lord, and might be redeemed from the priest, and so made common; and
on the fifth year were eaten in course; so the Targums of Jerusalem,
Jonathan, and Jarchi, interpret it: "let him also go and return unto his
house, lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it"; or make it
common, according to the above law: Aben Ezra seems to have another
sense of this passage, deriving the word from another, which signifies
piping and dancing, and observes, that it was a custom to sing, pipe,
and dance in vineyards; and the Septuagint version is, "hath not been
made merry of it"; though that may signify not having drank of the wine
of it, to be made merry with it.

[Deuteronomy 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 20:7</span></span>

And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken
her?.... Home to his house and bedded with her; has only betrothed her,
but is not properly married to her, the nuptials are not completed; this
the Jews understand of anyone betrothed to him, whether a virgin or a
widow, or the wife of a deceased brother (yea, they say, if his brother
is dead in war, he returns and comes home), but not of a former wife
divorced and received again (m):

let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in battle, and another
man take her; or marry her.

\(m\) Misn. Sotah, ib. sect. 2.

[Deuteronomy 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 20:8</span></span>

And the officers shall speak further unto the people,.... According to
Maimonides (n), the priest the anointed of war spoke to the end of [Deu
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#007.md) and which the officers repeated
after him to the people aloud, as before observed; and then after that
an officer speaks of himself, or in his own words, and not in those of
the priest, as follows:

what man that is fearful, &c. and then another officer causes all the
people to hear it:

and they shall say, what man is there that is fearful and fainthearted?
that has not courage to face his enemies, to whom the terrors of war,
and especially of death, are dreadful; the Targum of Jonathan
adds,"because of his sin;''whose sins stare him in the face, and lie
heavy on his conscience; so that he is afraid he shall die in battle,
and in his sins, and suffer divine vengeance; both these senses are
observed in the Misnah (y). According to R. Akiba, a fearful and
fainthearted man is one"that cannot stand in battle array, or behold a
drawn sword; but R. Jose the Galilean says, he is one that is afraid of
the transgressions he has committed; and therefore the law joins to this
all those things for which a man may return;''as having built a new
house, planted a vineyard, and betrothed a wife; that so it might be
thought it was on account of one or other of these that he returned, and
not through faintheartedness, either because of the terrors of war, or
of his own conscience for his sins:

let him go and return to his house, lest his brethren's heart faint as
well as his heart; lest, by his pale looks and trembling joints, his
fainting fits and swoons, he discourage the rest in the same company
with him, and by his example make them unfit for war also.

[Deuteronomy 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 20:9</span></span>

And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the
people,.... By reciting what the anointed of war said unto them, and by
speeches of their own framing, to encourage to the battle; and all were
dismissed that had leave to depart, and chose to take it:

that they shall make captains of armies to lead on the people; on to
battle; that is, either the officers should do this, which may seem to
confirm what has been hinted, that they might be generals of the army,
who constituted captains under them, to lead the people on to battle:
unless this is to be understood of the princes of Israel, or of the king
when they had one, and his ministers; for it does not appear in any
instance that the people chose their own officers over them, to go out
before them, and lead them on to battle; or "to be at the head of them"
(z); which the Jewish writers understand in a very different sense; not
to head them, or be at the head of them, to direct and command them, but
to keep them from deserting: their sense is, that the officers having
dismissed persons in the circumstances before described, and set stout
men before them, and others behind them (i.e. the army of the people),
with iron hatchets in their hands, and every one that sought to return,
they had power to cut off his legs; since flight is the beginning of
falling before their enemies (a).

[Deuteronomy 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 20:10</span></span>

When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it,.... This is to be
understood of an arbitrary war, as Jarchi observes; which they engaged
in of themselves, or were provoked to by their enemies; which was their
own choice, and according to their own will and pleasure; and their
conduct towards their enemies in it was different from that in a war
with the seven nations, commanded by the Lord, and distinguished from
it, [Deu 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#015.md).

then proclaim peace unto it; that is, offer them terms of peace; which
were, that the inhabitants of it should renounce idolatry, and become
their tributaries and servants.

[Deuteronomy 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 20:11</span></span>

And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace,.... Comply with the
terms of peace offered:

and open unto thee; the gates of the city and its garrisons, and deliver
all into their hands:

then it shall be that all the people that is found therein; some having
made their escape before the surrender of the city:

shall be tributaries unto thee: pay a yearly tax imposed upon them, as
the Moabites sometimes did, and which was paid in lambs and rams with
the wool, [Kg2 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#004.md)

and they shall serve thee; not as slaves, or be in continual bondage and
servitude; but upon occasion be called out to any public service, as
joining them against their enemies, rebuilding palaces and cities, or
repairing walls of cities, and the like; and in general acknowledge
their dominion over them, and their own subjection to them, by paying an
annual tribute, or sending gifts unto them; thus the Moabites, Syrians,
and Edomites, became the servants of David, [Sa2
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#002.md).

[Deuteronomy 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 20:12</span></span>

And if it will make no peace with thee,.... Will not accept of terms of
peace offered:

but will make war against thee; come out and fight, or prepare to defend
themselves: then thou shall besiege it; surround and block it up on all
sides with their forces; the Jews say only on three sides, leaving one
for any to flee and make their escape if they thought fit; See Gill on
[Num 31:7](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#007.md).

[Deuteronomy 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 20:13</span></span>

And when the Lord thy God hath delivered it into thine hands,.... When,
what with pressures without, and calamities within, the city is obliged
to surrender: this is not to be imputed to the methods and arts of war
used in besieging, or to the courage and skill of the besiegers; but to
the power and providence of God succeeding means used, and sending
famine or pestilence among the besieged, and inclining their hearts to
deliver up their city:

thou shall smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword; the men
in it, grown persons, as distinguished from little ones in the next
verse; because it was owing to these it was not surrendered at once,
when terms of peace were offered.

[Deuteronomy 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 20:14</span></span>

But the women, the little ones, and the cattle,.... These were to be
spared; women, because of the weakness of their sex, and subjection to
their husbands; and little ones, which take in males as well as females,
as Jarchi observes, because of their tender age; and cattle because of
their insensibility; all these having had no concern in holding out the
siege:

and all that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shall thou take
unto thyself; gold, silver, merchandise, household goods, utensils in
trade, and whatever was of any worth and value to be found in their
houses:

and thou shall eat the spoil of thine enemies, which the Lord thy God
hath given thee; that is, enjoy all their wealth and riches, estates and
possessions; for this is not to be restrained to things eatable only.

[Deuteronomy 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 20:15</span></span>

Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from
thee,.... As all such were reckoned that were without the land of
Israel, even all in their neighbouring nations, the Moabites, Edomites,
Ammonites, Syrians, &c. for the children of Israel never went to war
with any very distant nations, unless they came unto them and invaded
them; nor did they seek to carry their conquests to any great distance,
when the most powerful and victorious, as in the days of David and
Solomon:

which are not of the cities of these nations; of these seven nations, as
the Targum of Jonathan, the seven nations of the land of Canaan; all
that were not of them were accounted foreign cities, and at a distance.

[Deuteronomy 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 20:16</span></span>

But of the cities of those people, which the Lord thy God doth give thee
for an inheritance,.... The cities of the seven nations, six of which
are mentioned by name in the next verse:

thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth; the reason of this
severity was because of their wickedness, the capital crimes and gross
abominations they were guilty of, and for which they deserved to die;
and on account whereof they were reserved to this destruction, when the
measure of their iniquities was full, such as idolatry, incest,
witchcraft, soothsaying, necromancy, &c. see [Lev
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#003.md).

[Deuteronomy 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 20:17</span></span>

But thou shalt utterly destroy them,.... Men, women, and children: some
think this is to be understood only of such cities which did not accept
of terms of peace; for they are of opinion that Joshua made proclamation
of peace to all the cities of Canaan; which being not complied with, he
destroyed them as they fell into his hands; and they suppose that the
Gibeonites had not heard of such a proclamation, and therefore were
spared; and it is certain that there were many who were suffered to live
among them, who it may be thought were allowed on their becoming
proselytes, which was one of the terms of peace, as Rahab and her
household did, and which is the sense of some of the Jewish writers.
Jarchi on the following verse observes, that if they repented, and
became proselytes, they might be received: namely:

the Hittites and the Amorites, the Canaanites and the Perizzites, the
Hivites and the Jebusites; one of the seven nations is here omitted, the
Girgashites, as they are also in [Exo
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#023). It is said (b.md), that"Joshua
sent three letters into the land of Israel before they went into it; in
the first, whoever would turn (and flee) might; in the second, whoever
would make peace might; in the third, whoever would make war might: the
Girgashites, believing God, went to Africa, according to [Isa
36:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#017.md), the land there is Africa; the
Gibeonites made peace and dwelt in the land; thirty one kings made war,
and fell:"

as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee; [Deu
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001.md).

\(b\) T. Hieros. Shebiith, fol. 37. 3. Debarim Rabba, sect. 5. fol. 241.

[Deuteronomy 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 20:18</span></span>

That they teach you not to do after all their abominations,.... This is
another reason why they were to be utterly destroyed, not only because
of the abominations which they committed, but to prevent the Israelites
being taught by them to do the same; wherefore, as before observed from
Jarchi, such as became proselytes were suffered to live among them,
because there was no danger of idolatry from them, which even proselytes
of the gate renounced; and though all other abominations are included,
yet this is particularly respected, as appears from the following
clause:

which they have done unto their gods; to the honour of whom not only
many superstitious rites and ceremonies were performed, and idolatrous
actions committed, but acts of lewdness, and even unnatural uncleanness:

so should ye sin against the Lord your God; a sin the most provoking to
him, as the sin of idolatry was; and cause his anger to rise to such a
degree, as to suffer them to be carried captive from the land he gave
them to inherit; and which afterwards, was the case, and that through
learning the manners and customs of these people; see [Psa
106:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#034.md).

[Deuteronomy 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 20:19</span></span>

When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to
take it,.... Before it will surrender; it holding out the siege a
considerable time: the Hebrew text says, "many days" (c); which the
Targum of Jonathan interprets of all the seven days, to make war against
it, in order to subdue it on the sabbath day. Jarchi observes, that
"days" signify two, and "many" three; hence it is said, they do not
besiege cities of the Gentiles less than three days before the sabbath;
and he also says it teaches that peace is opened or proclaimed two or
three days first:

thou shall not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them;
that is, not cut them down with an axe, such trees as were without the
city, and in the power of the besiegers: what sort of trees are meant
appears by what follows:

for thou mayest eat of them; the fruit of them, which shows them to be
fruit trees, and gives a reason for not cutting them down, since they
would be useful in supplying them with what was agreeable to eat:

and thou shalt not cut them down to employ them in the siege; in
building bulwarks and batteries, and making of machines to cast out
stones, and the like, to the annoyance of the besieged; which might as
well or better be made of other trees, as in the next verse:

for the tree of the field is man's life; by the fruit of which, among
other things, his life is supported and maintained: but some give a
different version and sense of this clause, for the tree of the field is
man (d), or is man's; it is his property; but this is not a sufficient
reason why it should not be cut down, whether the property of the
besieger, in whose hand it is, or of the besieged, to whom it belonged:
or, "for, is the tree of the field a man" (e)? that has given any reason
of being thus used? no; it is no cause of the war, nor of the holding
out of the siege; and had it a voice, as Josephus (f) observes, it would
complain of injury done it, and apologize for itself. Some supply the
negative, "for the tree of the field is not a man"; so the Targum of
Onkelos, as well as makes it a comparative form of speech;"for not as a
man is the tree of the field, to come out against thee in a siege;''the
Targum of Jonathan is,

"for not as a man is the tree of the field, to be hid from you in a
siege;''or, as some in Aben Ezra express it,"it is not as a man, that it
should flee from before thee;''it can neither annoy thee, nor get out of
thy way; and therefore to lift up an axe against it, to cut it down, as
if it was a man, and an enemy that stood in the way, is ridiculous and
weak; though the sense of the said writer himself is the same with that
of our version; but what seems best is to read the words, "for, O man,
of the trees of the field" (there is enough of them) to bring "before
thee for a bulwark" (g); to make use of, without cutting down fruit
trees: though some understand it metaphorically, that as the tree of the
field is, so is man, or should be, bring forth fruit, that he may not be
cut down; see [Mat 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#010). Plutarch (h.md)
relates, that it was forbidden the worshippers of Osiris to destroy
garden trees.

[Deuteronomy 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">deu 20:20</span></span>

Only the trees which thou knowest that they be not trees for meat,....
Which might be known not only by their not having fruit upon them, but
by other tokens, and even at a time of year when there was no fruit on
any, which might be sometimes the season of a siege:

thou shalt destroy and cut them down; if so to do was of any disservice
to the enemy, or of any service to them, as follows; they had a liberty
to destroy them if they would:

and thou shall build bulwarks against the city that maketh war, until it
be subdued; build bulwarks of the trees cut down, and raise batteries
with them, or make machines and engines of the wood of them, to cast
stones into the city to annoy the inhabitants of it, in order to make
them surrender, and until they do it. All this may be an emblem of the
axe being to be laid to fruitless trees in a moral and spiritual sense;
and of trees of righteousness, laden with the fruits of righteousness,
the planting of the Lord, being preserved and never to be cut down or
rooted up; see [Mat 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#010.md).
