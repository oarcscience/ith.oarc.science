### [Proverbs Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 18:1</span></span>

Through desire a man having separated himself, seeketh,.... Or, "a
separated man seeketh desire" (g); his own desire, will, and pleasure.
This is either to be understood in a good sense, of one that has a real
and hearty desire after sound wisdom and knowledge, and seeks in the use
of all proper means to attain it; and in order to which he separates
himself from the world and the business of it, and retires to his study,
and gives up himself to reading, meditation, and prayer; or goes abroad
in search of it, as Aben Ezra: or of a vain man that affects
singularity; and who, through a desire of gratifying that lust,
separates himself, not only from God, as Jarchi interprets it, pursuing
his evil imagination and the lust of his heart; and from his friends, as
the Septuagint and Arabic versions; but from all men, like the Jews, who
"please not God, and are contrary to all men"; so such a man sets
himself to despise and contradict the sentiments and opinions of others,
and to set up his own in opposition to them. This is true of the
Pharisees among the Jews, who had their name from separating themselves
from all others, having an high opinion of their own Wisdom and
sanctify; and also of the Gnostics among the Christians, who boasted of
their knowledge, and separated themselves from the Christian assemblies;
and were sensual, not having the Spirit, being vainly puffed up with
their fleshly mind;

and intermeddleth with all wisdom; the man who is desirous of being
truly wise and knowing grasps at all wisdom, every branch of useful
knowledge; would gladly learn something of every art and science worthy
of regard; and he makes use of all means of improving himself therein;
and covets the company and conversation of men of wisdom and knowledge,
that he may attain to more; he intermingles himself with men of wisdom,
as Aben Ezra interprets it, and walks and converses with them. Or if
this is to be understood of a vain glorious person, the sense is, "he
intermeddles" or "mingles himself with all business" (h), as it may be
rendered; he thrusts himself into affairs that do not concern him, and
will pass his judgment on things he has nothing to do with; or he
monopolizes all knowledge to himself, and will not allow any other to
have any share with him. Jarchi interprets this clause thus,

"among wise men his reproach shall be made manifest;''

and observes, that their Rabbins explain it of Lot separating from
Abraham, following the desires of his heart: but R. Saadiah Gaon better
interprets it of an apostate from religion; that objects to everything
solid and substantial, in a wrangling and contentious manner; and "shows
his teeth" (i) at it, as Schultens, from the use of the Arabic word,
renders it.

\(g\) So the Targum. (h) "immiscet se omni negotio", Munster; "omnibus
quae sunt immiscet se", Junius & Tremellius. (i) "Et in omne solidum
dentes destringei", Schultens.

[Proverbs 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 18:2</span></span>

A fool hath no delight in understanding,.... In natural understanding,
and in the improvement of his mind in it; he delights not in books, nor
in the conversation of men of learning and sense: or in spiritual
understanding, in the understanding of spiritual things; these are
foolishness to a natural man; nor does he delight in reading the
Scriptures, nor in hearing the word, and attendance on it in the house
of God, but is weary of such exercises;

but that his heart may discover itself; and the folly that is in it:
such men only desire to have some knowledge and understanding, to make a
show of it, that they may be thought to be wise, and to be capable of
talking of things as if they understood them, when it is only to the
exposing of themselves and their ignorance; some persons attain to no
more learning and knowledge than just to be capable to show that they
are fools. Or, "but in the discovery of his heart" (k); he delights in
discovering that; not the wisdom, but the folly that is in it.

\(k\) "sed in patefacere cor ejus", Vatablus; "sed in detectione cordis
sui", Piscator; "sed sane ut enudet cor suum", Schultens.

[Proverbs 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 18:3</span></span>

When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt,.... When he comes
into the world, as Aben Ezra; as soon as he is born, he is liable to
contempt, being born in sin; but this is true of all: rather, as the
Vulgate Latin, and with which the Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic
versions agree, when he cometh into the depth of sin, or to the height
of his wickedness; he commences a scoffer at, and condemner of all that
is good: when he comes into the house of God, it may be said, "there
comes contempt"; for he comes not to hear the word, in order to receive
any profit by it, but to contemn it, and the ministers of it;

and with ignominy reproach: or, "with the ignominious man reproach" (l):
he that despises all that is good, and treats divine things in a
ludicrous way, will not spare to reproach the best of men, and speak
evil of them falsely, for the sake of religion. Or the meaning of the
whole is, that wicked men, sooner or later, come into contempt,
ignominy, and reproach, themselves; they that despise the Lord are
lightly esteemed by him; and a vile person is contemned in the eyes of a
good man: such bring shame and disgrace upon themselves and families
while they live; and, when they die, they are laid in the grave with
dishonour; an infamy rests upon their memories, and they wilt rise to
everlasting shame and contempt.

\(l\) "viro ignominioso, venit opprobriunu", Pagninus; "cum ignominioso
probrum", Junis & Tremeilius; "cum probroso opprobrium", Schultens, so
Vatablus, Mercerus, Gejerus.

[Proverbs 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 18:4</span></span>

The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters,.... The words of a great
and mighty man; of an excellent and valuable man, as Jarchi; or of a
wise man, as Aben Ezra. The doctrines which such a man has imbibed, and
his heart is full of and his mouth utters, are like to "waters", pure,
purifying, and refreshing; to "deep waters", which make no noise, and
cannot be easily fathomed: such are the deep mysteries of grace, the
wisdom of God in a mystery, spoken among them that are perfect; of which
a good man makes no boast, but humbly declares; out of the abundance of
his heart, his mouth speaks;

and the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook; there is a spring of
spiritual wisdom and knowledge in him; a well of living water, springing
up unto everlasting life; and from thence it flows freely and
constantly; communicating itself liberally unto others, and ministering
grace to the hearers, for their edification.

[Proverbs 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 18:5</span></span>

It is not good to accept the person of the wicked,.... For a judge to
have respect to a wicked man in a cause before him, and to favour him,
because he is a rich man, or a relation, or he has received some
kindness from him; none of these things should have any influence upon
him

to overthrow the righteous in judgment: though he may be a poor man and
a stranger, and to whom the judge is under no private and personal
obligation; yet justice ought to be done without any respect to persons;
to do otherwise is not only not good, but very bad, very sinful and
criminal; it is contrary to law and justice; it is doing injury to men,
and is repugnant to the will of God, and offensive to him, [Lev
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#015.md).

[Proverbs 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 18:6</span></span>

A fool's lips enter into contention,.... That is, between others, when
he has nothing to do with it; but he must be meddling, and make himself
a party in the contention, which is an argument of his folly; he says
things which occasion disputes, raise contentions among men, and provoke
to wrath and anger. The Septuagint version is, "the lips of a fool lead
him to evils": for, as they lead him to contention and strife, the issue
of that is confusion and every evil work;

and his mouth calleth for strokes: as he stirs up and encourages
contention, so he proceeds to blows, and excites others to them; from
words he goes to blows, and, by the ill and provoking language of his
mouth, gets many a blow to himself. Jarchi seems to understand it of
chastisement, from the hand of God; see [Pro
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#003.md).

[Proverbs 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 18:7</span></span>

A fool's mouth is his destruction,.... The cause of it; for his
contentions, and quarrels, and evil speaking, lawsuits are commenced
against him, which bring ruin upon himself and his family now; as well
as for his idle and wicked words he will be condemned hereafter, [Mat
12:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#035.md); there is a world of iniquity in
the mouth and tongue of a wicked man, which bring destruction upon
himself and others, [Jam 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#006.md);

and his lips are the snare of his soul; from speaking in his own
defence, he says things which should not be said, and by which he is
entangled yet more and more; he is caught by his own words and condemned
by them; or his loquacity, in which he delights, is a snare unto him to
say things which neither become him, nor are for his advantage, but the
contrary; see [Pro 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#013.md).

[Proverbs 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 18:8</span></span>

The words of a talebearer are as wounds,.... Or rather they are wounds;
they wound the credit and reputation of the person of whom the tale is
told; they wound the person to whom it is told, and destroy his love and
affection to his friend; and in the issue they wound, hurt, and ruin the
talebearer himself. Or, they are "as of those that are wounded" (m);
they pretend to be affected with the case they tell, and to be grieved
for the failings and infirmities of those they are secretly exposing,
when at the same time they rejoice at them: or, they are "secret" hidden
ones, as Aben Ezra interprets it; they are spoken secretly, and wound
secretly, in a backbiting way: or, they are "smooth" or flattering (n),
as Kimchi; they are smoother than oil, and glide easily into the minds
of others: rather, "are greedily swallowed down" (o), as the word in the
Arabic language signifies; as Schultens has shown, and so renders it.
Hence it follows:

and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly; go down
pleasantly, and sink deep into the hearts of those to whom they are
told; where they have a place and remain, both to the injury of the
persons that receive them, and of them of whom they are told; and,
though pleasing at first, they are as wounds in the inner parts, which
are mortal.

[Proverbs 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 18:9</span></span>

He also that is slothful in his work,.... Remiss in it; hangs down his
hands, and does not care to make use of them, but neglects his business:

is brother to him that is a great waster: a prodigal man, who spends his
substance in riotous living: the sluggard and the prodigal are brethren
in iniquity; for, though they take different courses, they are both
sinful, and issue in the same manner; both bring to poverty and want.
Or, "brother to a master that wastes" (p); a slothful servant and a
wasteful master are near akin, and come into the same class and
circumstances. Jarchi interprets it,

"he that separateth from the law, though a disciple of a wise man, is a
brother to Satan;''

whose name is Apollyon, the waster and destroyer. A man that is slothful
in spiritual things, though a professor of religion, and has a place in
the house of God, is brother to him that is a waster and persecutor of
it; see [Mat 12:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#030.md).

[Proverbs 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 18:10</span></span>

The name of the Lord is a strong tower,.... By "the name of the Lord"
may be meant, either the attributes and perfections of God, by which he
is made known, and which are the strength and security of his people;
his goodness, grace, and mercy, are their defence; his favour
encompasses them about, as a shield; his justice protects them from all
injuries and insults; his truth and faithfulness preserve them; they are
kept by his power, as in a garrison; and his unchangeableness is a
reason why they are not consumed: or else the Lord himself; his name is
put for himself, [Psa 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#001.md); and may be
well interpreted of the Messiah, as it is by the ancient Jew, (q); in
and by whom God is manifested unto men as the God of grace; in whom he
proclaims his name, a God gracious and merciful; whose name is in him,
and who has the same nature and perfections with him; his name is
Jehovah, our righteousness; Immanuel, God with us; the mighty God, and
Prince of peace; and who is called Jesus, because he saves his people
from their sins, and so is their security from eternal destruction. What
a strong tower is to them that are within it, against an enemy without,
that is the power, strength, and might of Christ to his people; as a
divine Person, he is strong and mighty, the most mighty, the Almighty;
as man, he is the man of God's right hand, made strong for himself and
us; as Mediator, he has all power in heaven and earth: in him is
everlasting strength for his people; he is their Betzer, their fortified
place, or city of refuge, to flee unto on all occasions; he is the
strong hold, whither prisoners of hope are directed to turn to; he is
their place of defence, and the munition of rocks; a strong tower,
inexpugnable; so deeply founded, no enemy can work under it; and plant a
mine to blow it up; so highly built; no scaling ladders can reach it; so
fortified, no cannon balls can break through it, or demolish any of its
walls and bulwarks, which are his salvation; the gates of hell cannot
prevail against it; it is not to be taken by storm, or by the most
violent attack of the whole posse of men and devils;

the righteous runneth into it; not self-righteous persons, they run from
Christ and his righteousness, not to him and that; but such who see
their own righteousness will not justify them; who indeed are sinners,
know and acknowledge themselves to be such; as sinners go to Christ,
who, as such, receives them; and these are righteous through the
righteousness of Christ imputed to them, and live soberly, righteously,
and godly: and it is the continual business or employment of their faith
to betake themselves to Christ upon all occasions; they are continually
coming to him, and exercising faith upon him, as the Lord their
righteousness, which is meant by "running" to him; this supposes
knowledge of him, as the strong tower and city of refuge; of the way
unto him, and of the reception by him which may be expected; it supposes
a principle of spiritual life, and some degree of spiritual strength; a
sense of danger or of want in themselves, and of safety and fulness in
Christ; it is expressive of haste, readiness, and cheerfulness, and is
owing to the drawings of efficacious grace;

and such an one that thus runs

is safe; from the avenging justice of God; from the curse and
condemnation of the law; from sin, and all its dreadful consequences;
from Satan, and all spiritual enemies; from wrath to come, hell, and the
second death: or is "set aloft" (r); is on high; for this tower, as it
is a strong one, it is a high one; a rock of refuge, higher than men, or
angels, or heaven itself; and such who are in it are out of the reach of
all danger and every enemy.

[Proverbs 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 18:11</span></span>

The rich man's wealth is his strong city,.... In which he dwells, over
which he presides; in which he places his trust and confidence, and
thinks himself safe from every enemy and from all trouble: as one (s)
observes,

"the abundance of a rich man's wealth he conceives to be as it were the
abundance of people in a "city"; the telling of his money he imagines to
be the walking of people up and down the streets; his bags standing
thick together to be so many houses standing close one to the other; his
iron barred chests to be so mary bulwarks; his bonds and bills to be his
cannons and demi-cannons, his great ordinance; and in the midst of these
he thinketh himself environed with a "great wall", which no trouble is
able to leap over, which no misery is able to break through.''

As it follows;

and as a high wall in his own conceit: which not only separates and
distinguishes him from others; but, as he imagines, will secure him from
all dangers, and will be abiding, lasting, and durable: but all this is
only "in his own conceit", or "imagery" (t); in the chambers of his
imagery, as Jarchi, referring to [Eze
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#012.md); where the same word is used; for
this wall shall not stand; these riches cannot secure themselves, they
take wing and fly away; and much less the owner of them, not from public
calamities, nor from personal diseases of body, nor from death, nor from
wrath to come.

[Proverbs 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 18:12</span></span>

Before destruction the heart of man is haughty,.... Lifted up with his
riches. Rich men are apt to be highminded, and therefore are to be
charged and cautioned against it; they are apt to look above their poor
neighbours, and with contempt upon them; and very often this haughtiness
of theirs is a presage of their ruin and destruction: and those haughty
airs are put on from the pride of their hearts, when a "breach" is near,
as the word (u) signifies, or when they are ready to break; however,
their haughty spirits are, sooner or later, humbled by one distressing
providence or another; see [Pro 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#018.md);

and before honour is humility; See Gill on [Pro
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#033.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 18:13</span></span>

He that answereth a matter before he heareth it,.... Who is impatient,
and cannot wait to hear it out, but breaks in upon the speaker before he
has finished what he has to say; or is rash and precipitate, and returns
an answer at once, without weighing and considering, and thoroughly
understanding, what is said:

it is folly and shame unto him; his answer must be a foolish one, and
bring shame and confusion upon him; men should be "swift to hear", and
"slow to speak", [Jam 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#009.md).

[Proverbs 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 18:14</span></span>

The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity,.... The spirit of a
mighty man, as Jarchi; a man of spirit, that has a spirit of fortitude,
even of natural fortitude, and especially of Christian fortitude; that
has a spirit of might upon him, of power, and sound mind; a man of a
Christian spirit, that is renewed in the spirit of his mind; who is a
spiritual man, and has the Spirit of God in him, as well as a rational
soul, an immaterial, immortal, and never dying substance. Such a man
will bear up under many trials and exercises of life; will support under
bodily infirmities; will take patiently the loss Of friends and of
substance; endure reproach, and the loss of a good name, credit, and
reputation, cheerfully, for righteousness's sake; and suffer persecution
for the sake of Christ, and his Gospel, with an undaunted and unbroken
spirit: the peace of conscience he feels within; the presence of God
with him; the love of God shed abroad in his heart; seeing all his
afflictions flowing from love, and working for his good; and having in
view the glories of another world; he bears up under and goes through
all afflictions with ease and pleasure; his conscience is clear, his
heart is whole, his mind is easy; his wounds being healed, his sins
pardoned, and his soul saved in Chris;

but a wounded spirit who can bear? or a "smitten" (w) one, smitten by
the Lord; by the word of the Lord, which he uses as a hammer to break
rocky hearts in pieces; by the law of God, which produces wrath, and a
looking for of fiery indignation; by the Spirit of God, awakening the
conscience, and convicting it of sin, righteousness, and judgment; which
smitings are very grievous, though they tend to bring to repentance; are
in order to healing, and are in love. Or, "a broken spirit" (x), as in
[Pro 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#022.md); broken with a sense of
sin, and with an excess of sorrow for it; when a man becomes lifeless
and hopeless, has no hope of life and salvation, and is in the utmost
confusion; all his measures and purposes are broken, as well as his
heart; he knows not what to do, nor what way to take; he is
disconsolate, and refuses to be comforted; and which for the present is
intolerable: though the Lord has a regard to such, is nigh unto them;
has sent his son to bind up their broken hearts; yea, has himself been
broken for them; and happy it is for them that they fall on him and are
broken, and not he on them. Or, "a wounded spirit"; with a view of sin,
as committed against the omniscient and omnipotent Being, a pure and
holy God; a righteous one, whose nature is infinite; and so sin
committed against him requires an infinite satisfaction, which a
creature cannot give; and a God also, who is the author of their beings,
and the Father of their mercies; all which makes sin against him the
more cutting and wounding: likewise they are wounded with a view of the
evil nature of sin, and the aggravated circumstances that attend it; and
with the terrors of the law, that are set in array against them. And
such a spirit "who can bear?" not without the sight of a wounded
Saviour; or without a view of atonement by his sacrifice; or without the
discoveries and applications of pardoning grace; or without a sense of
peace and reconciliation made by the blood of Christ; or without some
hope of salvation by him; and unless the good Samaritan pours in oil and
wine into the wounds, and binds them up.

[Proverbs 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 18:15</span></span>

The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge,.... More knowledge; for he
must have some, and a considerable share, to be denominated "prudent",
whether in things natural, civil, or spiritual: and such will be
heartily desirous of more, and make use of all means to attain it, by
which they do come at a large share of it;

and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge; a wise man seeks to get it by
hearing; he listens to what others say, and especially such that are
wiser and more knowing than himself: so such as are wise to salvation,
as they desire to know more of Christ and of divine things, and make use
of all means for that purpose; among the rest, hearken to what
Christians, of a superior class to themselves, drop in private
conversation; and particularly they constantly attend to the ministry of
the word; and thus seeking it, they find an increase of it.

[Proverbs 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 18:16</span></span>

A man's gift maketh room for him,.... Or "enlarges him" (y); brings him
out of prison, or, or out of straits and difficulties with which he,
has, been pressed; or it makes way for him to a judge, and for a
favourable hearing of his cause; or it enlarges his acquaintance, and
gains him respect among men;

and bringeth him before great men; it opens a way for him into the
presence and company of great men, being a fee to their servants; or
with it he procures a place to wait on them. It is not necessary to
understand it of a gift by way of bribe; but to introduce a person to
another, and render him acceptable, and appease anger; as in the cases
of Jacob and Abigail, [Gen 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#020.md).

[Proverbs 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 18:17</span></span>

He that is first in his own cause seemeth just,.... As perhaps Tertullus
did, before Paul made his defence; and as Ziba, Mephibosheth's servant,
before his master detected him: this often appears true in telling a
tale, in private conversation, in lawsuits before a judge and a court of
judicature, and in theological controversies;

but his neighbour cometh, and searcheth him; his neighbour comes into
the house, where he is telling his tale, and reports it in another
manner, and shows the falsehood of his relation; or he comes into a
court of judicature, and sets the cause in quite another light; or he
comes out into the worm by public writing, and exposes the errors of a
man engaged in a wrong cause, and refutes his arguments. It is generally
understood of judicial affairs, that the first that opens a cause is
very apt to prejudice the judge and court in his favour, and they are
ready to thing at first hearing that he is in the right; but it is not
proper to be hasty in forming a judgment till the other side is heard;
for his antagonist comes and traverses the point, unravels the whole
affair, shows the weakness of his cause, the vanity of his pretences,
and makes void all his allegations; and then "he", the judge, so some
interpret it, "searcheth"; inquires more narrowly into the case, in
order to find out truth, and pass a right judgment and sentence.

[Proverbs 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 18:18</span></span>

The lot causeth contentions to cease,.... When a case cannot be
determined among parties at variance in a private way, nor in a court of
judicature, the lot is cast, and that puts an end to all strife, and
makes each party easy; they submit to it, and acquiesce in it;

and parteth between the mighty; the kings and princes of the earth; men
of great power and authority, and of great riches and affluence; and so
in a capacity of contending with each other, and of prolonging the
contention, which may be attended with bad consequences; and who are not
easily dissuaded from it: or it may intend such who most vehemently
disagree; persons of great spirits, who are obstinate and stubborn, and
will by no means yield, and there is no parting them by arguments or
legal decisions; these the lot parts, and causes them to cease from
their quarrels and contentions, and to rest satisfied with the
distributions the lot makes to them; as the children of Israel were with
their portion of the land of Canaan, assigned them by lot.

[Proverbs 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 18:19</span></span>

A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city,.... A
fortified city may sooner be taken by an enemy, than one brother
offended can be reconciled to another; their resentments against each
other are keener than against another person that has offended them; and
their love being turned into hatred, it is more bitter; and it is more
difficult to compose differences between brethren than between enemies;
wherefore such should take care that they fall not out by the way: this
is true of brethren in a natural sense; as the cases of Abel and Cain,
Jacob and Esau, Joseph and his brethren, Amnon and Absalom, and others,
show; and of brethren in a spiritual sense, as Paul and Barnabas, Luther
and Calvin, and others;

and their contentions are like the bars of a castle: which cannot be
easily broken or cut asunder: so contentions, especially those among
brethren, are with great difficulty made to cease, and their differences
composed; they will stand it out against one another as long as a strong
city, or a barred castle, against an enemy.

[Proverbs 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 18:20</span></span>

A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth,.... With
his own words and discourses, when they are prudent, pious, and savoury;
when they are with grace, and minister it; they are satisfying to
himself, to his own mind and conscience, and to his family; to all
within his house, which is, as it were, his belly; but, if otherwise, it
will not be profitable nor satisfying to either; and therefore, if a man
would keep conscience easy, and be useful to others, he ought to take
care what he says; see [Pro 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#014.md);

and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled; the same thing as
before, expressed in different words, alluding to the sowing, of seed in
the earth, and the increase of it; as a man sows he reaps, and enjoys
the fruits of his labour; according to what a man sows with his lips,
such is his harvest he is afterwards a partaker of.

[Proverbs 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 18:21</span></span>

Death and life are in the power of the tongue,.... Of witnesses,
according to the testimony they bear; of judges, according to the
sentence they pass; of teachers, according to the doctrine they preach;
of all men, who, by their well or ill speaking, bring death or life to
themselves and others. Some, by their tongues, by the too free use of
them, or falsehood they utter, are the cause of death to themselves and
others; and some, by their silence, or by their prudent speech and
prevalent intercession, secure or obtain life for themselves and others;
yea, judgment at the last day will proceed according to a man's words,
"By thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be
condemned", [Mat 12:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#037.md); the tongue is
the instrument either of a great deal of good, or of a great deal of
evil;

and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof; that delight to be
talkative; that love to use the tongue, whether in a good or in a bad
way, shall accordingly be recompensed; shall enjoy the advantages or
disadvantages arising from it.

[Proverbs 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 18:22</span></span>

Whoso findeth a wife,.... A good one; so the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin,
Syriac, and Arabic versions, supply it; and so the Targum, though it
leaves out the word good in the last clause; and no other can be meant,
even a good natured one, wise, prudent, careful, and industrious; a
proper helpmeet, a virtuous woman, as in [Pro
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#010.md); whoso seeks after such an one,
and finds one, especially one that has the grace of God, which he should
seek after among his friends, and by their assistance, and by prayer to
God:

findeth a good thing; that will be good for him, both upon a civil and
spiritual account; the Septuagint version adds,

"he that casts out a good wife casts out good things, but he that
retains a whore is foolish and ungodly;''

which is followed by the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic versions, but
is not in the Hebrew text. Jarchi interprets it of the law in a mystic
sense, but, according to the literal sense, of a good wife;

and obtaineth favour of the Lord; it is from the Lord, and under his
direction and guidance in seeking, that he finds a good wife; and which
he ought to esteem as a favour from the Lord, and as an evidence of his
favour to him, and may encourage himself to hope for others of him (z)
Hesiod says, a man cannot obtain anything better than a good wife.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 18:23</span></span>

The poor useth entreaties,.... Or "supplications" (a); he is an humble
supplicant to others for favours he asks in a submissive and lowly
manner; he does not demand anything, nor prescribe what shall be done
for him, but modestly tells his case, and submits it; so such who are
poor in spirit are humble supplicants at the throne of grace;

but the rich answereth roughly; being proud and haughty, lifted up with
their riches, and in fear of none, they answer others with hard and
rough words, especially their inferiors, and particularly the poor. This
is not what ought to be, but what commonly is. This verse and [Pro
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#024.md) are not in the Arabic version.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 18:24</span></span>

A man that hath friends must show himself friendly,.... Friendship ought
to be mutual and reciprocal, as between David and Jonathan; a man that
receives friendship ought to return it, or otherwise he is guilty of
great ingratitude. This may be spiritually applied; a believer is "a man
of friends" (b), as it may be rendered; he has many friends: God is his
friend, as appears by his early love to him, his choice of him, and
provisions of grace for him; by sending his son to save him; by visiting
him, not only in a way of providence, but of grace; by disclosing his
secrets, showing his covenant to him, and by making him his heir, and a
joint heir with Christ. Christ is his friend, as is evident from his
visiting him at his incarnation; and in a spiritual way, by the
communication of his secrets to him; by his hearty counsel and faithful
reproofs; by his undertaking and doing for him what he has; and
especially by suffering and dying in his room and stead. The Holy Spirit
is his friend, which he has shown by discovering to him his woeful
estate by nature, and the way of salvation by Christ; by working all his
works in him; by acting the part of a Comforter to him; by revealing
divine things to him, by helping him under all his infirmities; by
making intercession for him according to the will of God; and by making
him meet for eternal glory and happiness: angels are his friends, as is
plain by their well pleasedness with the incarnation of Christ for men;
and which they express at their conversion; by their ministering to
them, their protection of them, and the good offices they do them both
in life and at death; and saints are friends to one another: and such
should show themselves friendly to God, their covenant God and Father;
by frequently visiting him at the throne of grace; by trusting in him;
by a carefulness not to offend, but please him; and by a close and
faithful adherence to his cause and interest: to Jesus Christ their
Redeemer, by a ready obedience to his commands; by owning and using him
as their friend; by taking notice of his friends, and showing them
respect, his ministers and poor saints; by cleaving to him, and
renouncing the friendship of his enemies: and likewise to the Holy
Spirit, by not grieving, quenching, and despising him; but by making use
of him, and giving up themselves to his influence and direction; and by
acknowledging him as the author of all their grace: also to angels, by
speaking well of them, owning their good offices, and reckoning it an
honour that they are come and joined to such a company; and to the
saints, by Christian conversation with them, by sympathizing with them
in all conditions, by hearty counsel, faithful reproofs and admonitions,
and by helping them in every distress, inward and outward;

and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother; who is to a
man as his own soul, [Deu 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#006.md); and so
are of one heart and soul, as Jonathan and David, and the first
Christians, were; this is true of Christ, and may be expressive of the
close union between him and his people; and of his close adherence to
their cause and interest; and of his constancy and continuance as a
friend at all times; and of his faithfulness and unchangeableness as
such; see [Pro 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#017.md). The Heathens had
a deity which presided over friendship, which they called Jupiter
Philios (c): the character best agrees with the true God, who is a
friend to men himself, and loves friendship among them.
