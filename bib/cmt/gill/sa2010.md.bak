INTRODUCTION TO SECOND SAMUEL 10

This chapter gives an account of the ill treatment of David's messengers
to the king of Ammon, who were sent to condole the death of his father,
and were basely used by him, which David resented, [Sa2
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#001.md); which the Ammonites perceiving
prepared for war, and got the Syrians to be confederates with them; of
which David being informed, sent Joab and Abishai into their country,
[Sa2 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#006.md); who divided the army
between them, and attacked the Ammonites and Syrians with great courage,
and routed them both, and returned to Jerusalem, [Sa2
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#009.md); after which the Syrians gathered
together again to fight with David, who went out to meet them, and got
an entire conquest over them, and made them servants to him, [Sa2
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#015.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 10:1</span></span>

And it came to pass after this,.... After the wars with the Moabites,
Syrians, and Edomites, being friendly with the children of Ammon, David
sent an embassy to their king, after related; by which it appears what
is said concerning the spoils of the children of Ammon, [Sa2
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#012.md), is by anticipation; for these
spoils were not taken until the following war with them, the occasion of
which is here told:

that the king of the children of Ammon died; whose name was Nahash, as
is clear from [Sa2 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#002.md), and probably
might be the same that came against Jabeshgilead, from whom Saul
delivered the inhabitants of that place, [Sa1
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#001.md),

and Hanun his son reigned in his stead; who, being his son, was heir to
his crown, and succeeded him in his kingdom.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 10:2</span></span>

Then said David, I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash,....
Send him a friendly compliment of condolence on the death of his father:

as his father showed kindness unto me; when David was persecuted by
Saul, he sent him aid, and invited him into his country for protection
it may be, and some way or other showed respect unto him; though not out
of real love and friendship to David, but in enmity to Saul, who had
defeated him at Jabeshgilead, and had often wars with him: the Jews say
(o) the particular kindness was, that when David left his father,
mother, and brethren, with the king of Moab, he slew all but one, who
fled to the king of the children of Ammon, and was by him saved alive:

and David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his
father; for the death of his father; to condole the loss of him, which
was the custom of kings in friendship and alliance in former times, and
still continues:

and David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon; even
to Rabbah, the metropolis of the nation, and the royal city, where the
king kept his court.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 10:3</span></span>

And the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun their lord,....
His nobles and prime ministers, the courtiers that were about him:

thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent
comforters unto thee? could he imagine that David was sincere, and that
he really meant to do honour to the memory of his father, and comfort
him under the loss of him, by sending his ambassadors to him on such an
errand? there was no reason, they thought, to believe this, since an
Israelite was forbidden to seek their peace and prosperity, or ask of
it, nor might Ammonite enter into their congregation unto the tenth
generation, [Deu 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#003.md); and indeed some
have thought that David did not do a right thing in sending this
embassy, and was justly requited; but it is certain he acted according
to the laws of friendship, and was cordial and sincere in what he did,
though these courtiers of Hanun put an ill construction on his conduct,
their minds being filled with enmity against the Israelites:

hath not David rather sent his servants unto thee to search the city,

and to spy it out, and to overthrow it? to reconnoitre the place, to
observe, as they walked about in it, which were the weakest and most
defenceless parts of it, and what avenues there were to it, and which
were most accessible, that they might the better know how to attack it,
and destroy it; these surmises and suspicions they endeavoured to fill
the king's head with, to set him against them, and treat them ill.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa2 10:4</span></span>

Wherefore Hanun took David's servants,.... His ambassadors:

and shaved off one half of their beards; that is, he ordered them to be
shaved off; than which a greater indignity could not have been well done
to them and to David, whom they represented, since the Israelites shaved
not their beards, and were very careful of preserving them; for had it
been the custom to shave, they might have shaved off the other half, and
then they would not have appeared so ridiculous; and with other people
it has been reckoned a very great punishment as well could be inflicted,
and as great an affront as could well be offered, to mar a man's beard,
or shave it off in whole or in part (p). The Lacedemonians, as Plutarch
(q) relates, when any fled from battle, used, by way of reproach, to
shave off part of their beards, and let the other part grow long; and
with the Indians, as Bishop Patrick observes from an ancient writer, the
king used to order the greatest offenders to be shaven, as the heaviest
punishment he could inflict upon them; but what comes nearest to the
case here is what the same learned commentator quotes from Tavernier,
who in his Indian Travels tells us, that the sophi of Persia caused an
ambassador of Aurengzeb to have his beard shaved off, telling him he was
not worthy to wear a beard, and thereupon commanded it should be shaved
off; which affront offered him in the person of his ambassador was most
highly resented by Aurengzeb, as this was by David:

and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks; and as
they wore long garments in those countries, without any breeches or
drawers under them, those parts by these means were exposed to view
which modesty requires should be concealed (r); so that they must be put
to the utmost shame and confusion:

and sent them away; in this ridiculous manner, scoffing and leering at
them no doubt; that since they came with compliments of condolence, it
was proper they should appear in the habit of mourners, with their
beards shaved, and their garments rent; cutting of garments, and
standing in them from morning tonight, was a punishment of soldiers with
the Romans, when they offended (s).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa2 10:5</span></span>

When they told it unto David,.... Not the ambassadors, for they were not
yet arrived, but some of their servants, perhaps, they sent before them
to acquaint David of the usage they had met with:

he sent to meet them: he sent men to meet them with proper garments to
put on, and to assure them how much he resented the indignity done to
them and him, and would avenge it in due and proper time, and to direct
them where to go for the present, as follows:

because the men were greatly ashamed: to proceed on their journey, and
come to court in the condition they were:

and the king said; gave orders by the messengers he sent to them:

tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, or "bud" (t):

and then return; that is, to Jerusalem; Jericho, though not yet built,
might have some cottages at or near the spot on which it had stood, for
the convenience of shepherds, and gatherers of fruit, in the plains of
it; here the ambassadors were directed to go, it being the first place
they came to when they had passed over Jordan, from the country of
Ammon; and being a place where there were scarcely any inhabitants, or
very few, was very proper for them in their present circumstances; and
this confirms what is before observed, that it was now the custom of the
Israelites not to shave their whole beards; or otherwise it was but
shaving off the other half, and being now provided with other clothes,
they would have had no need to have stayed at Jericho, but might have
proceeded on in their journey.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 10:6</span></span>

And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David,.... Or
had made themselves odious to him, as it is rendered in [Ch1
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#006.md); were abominable to him, that he
was incensed against them, and enraged at them, and was determined to be
avenged on them for the affront given, of which they had certain
information: but instead of seeking to appease him, and give him
satisfaction for the affront:

the children of Ammon sent, and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob; a place
near Hamath, [Num 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#021.md); there was a
city of this name in the tribe of Asher, out of which the Canaanites
could not be driven, and perhaps now inhabited by Syrians, or by a
people so called, [Jos 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#028.md),

and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen: that is, out of both
places; this place Hadadezer was king of, with whom David had fought
before, and beat, and who owed him a grudge on that account, and was
ready to assist the Ammonites against him, [Sa2
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#003.md),

and of King Maacah a thousand men; that is, of the king of Maacah, which
was a place in the tribe off Manasseh, from whence the inhabitants could
not be expelled, [Jos 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#011.md); and seems
now to have been inhabited by Syrians, and therefore is called
Syriamaachah, [Ch1 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#006.md),

and of Ishtob twelve thousand men; which is thought to be the same with
the land of Tob, whither Jephthah fled, and dwelt in it, when ill used
by his brethren, [Jdg 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#003.md); these
mercenary soldiers were in all thirty three thousand men; [Ch1
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#006.md), it is said, chariots and
horsemen, even thirty two thousand; these were hired with a thousand
talents of silver.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa2 10:7</span></span>

And when David heard of it,.... Of the preparation made by the Ammonites
to fight with him:

he sent Joab and all the host of the mighty men: he sent out Joab his
general, and an army under his command, consisting of men of strength,
valour, and courage; or all the host and the mighty men, as Kimchi and
Ben Melech, the famous mighty men mentioned in [Sa2
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#008.md); he did not think it advisable to
wait for the Ammonites, but carried the war into their own country, and,
instead of suffering them to invade his dominions, he invaded theirs.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 10:8</span></span>

And the children of Ammon came out,.... Either out of Rabbah their
metropolis, as Josephus (u); or rather out of Medeba, as it seems from
[Ch1 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#007.md); a city that lay on the
borders of their country, and was a frontier town, see [Num
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#030.md);

and put the battle in array, at the entering in of the gate; of the city
of Medeba; they were first within the city, but, upon the approach of
Joab and his army, they came out and drew up in a line of battle at the
gate of it:

and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and Ishtob, and Maacah, were by
themselves in the field; at some distance from the city, the Ammonites
not choosing to trust: mercenaries in it; and perhaps they placed these
ambush in the field, to get Joab between two fires, as we now express
it.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 10:9</span></span>

When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and
behind,.... Or "the face" of it (w); armies appeared both before and
behind, about to attack him both in front and rear; the Targum is,"and
Joab saw that the warriors, or those that made war, were strong against
him before and behind:"

he chose of all the choice men of Israel; the most eminent for strength,
and valour, and military skill, who had been tried, and were famous for
warlike exploits, the flower of the army:

and put them in array against the Syrians; who might be the strongest
party, and the best soldiers; though being but mercenaries, if hard
beset, would sooner give way, as he might suppose, upon which the
Ammonites would do the same.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa2 10:10</span></span>

And the rest of the people he delivered into the hands of Abishai his
brother,.... Who was a commander under him, and a very valiant man; and
thus, as his enemy had two armies, he divided his into two parts, that
he might the better attack them:

that he might put them in array against the children of Ammon: draw them
up in a line, place them rank and file to meet the children of Ammon,
and give them battle.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 10:11</span></span>

And he said, if the Syrians be too strong for me,.... Which he might
perceive by Joab's forces giving way, or by some signal agreed on
between them

then thou shall help me; detach a part of his army to his support and
assistance:

but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come
and help thee; in the same manner.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 10:12</span></span>

Be of good courage, and let us play the men,.... This Joab said, not
only to encourage Abishai and himself, but in the hearing of the rest of
the officers of the army, and of many of the people, to hearten them to
the battle; who might be somewhat intimidated with the number of their
enemies, and the position they were in, being before and behind them;
and therefore he thought proper to make such a speech to them to animate
them to light:

for our people, and for the cities of our God; that the people of Israel
might not be carried captive, and their cities spoiled and plundered;
and instead of being cities where the people of God dwelt, and he was
worshipped, would, if taken, become the habitations of idolatrous
Heathens, and where temples would be erected to idols, and the worship
of them; these were the arguments he used to engage them to fight
manfully for their country, the liberties and religion of it:

and the Lord do that which seemeth him good: tacitly suggesting that
victory was of the Lord, and that it became them to do their part in
fighting courageously, and leave the issue to the Lord, on whom alone
success depended.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 10:13</span></span>

And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto the battle
against the Syrians,.... Fell upon them; attacked them first, began the
battle with them; rightly judging, that if they, being hired soldiers,
were closely pressed, they would give way, which would discourage the
Ammonites, who depended much upon them; and the fight, according to
Josephus (x), lasted some little time, who says, that Joab killed many
of them, and obliged the rest to turn their backs and flee, as follows:

and they fled before him: the Syriac and Arabic versions in this verse,
and in all others in this chapter where the word "Syrians" is used, have
"Edomites", reading "Edom" instead of "Aram", the letters "R" and "D" in
the Hebrew tongue being very similar.

\(x\) Ut supra. (Antiqu. l. 7. c. 6. sect. 2.)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 10:14</span></span>

And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,.... In
whom they put great confidence:

then they fled also before Abishai; without engaging at all with him, as
it seems:

and entered into the city; out of which they came, either Rabbah or
Medeba, for their safety:

so Joab returned from the children of Ammon; did not stay to lay siege
to their city, the season of the year not being proper for it, winter
drawing near; see [Sa2 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#001.md),

and came to Jerusalem; in triumph, to report to David the victory he had
obtained.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa2 10:15</span></span>

And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel,....
Considered it in their minds, and conversed with one another about it,
and fearing what would be the consequence of it:

they gathered themselves together; not only the forces got together
again, that fled before Joab, but all the kings of Syria united their
forces together, as appears from [Sa2
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#019.md); supposing that David would
avenge himself on them for assisting the Ammonites against him; and
therefore judged it advisable to raise a large army, that they might be
in a condition to receive him.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 10:16</span></span>

And Hadarezer sent,.... The same with Hadadezer, [Sa2
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#003.md), who was at the head of this
confederacy, and to whom the rest of the kings of Syria were servants,
[Sa2 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#019.md),

and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river; the river Phrat
or Euphrates, as the Targum; so the Arabic version and Josephus (y), who
says, that he hired them:

and they came to Helam; which, according to the same writer, was king of
the Syrians beyond Euphrates; but it seems to be the name of a place,
where was the general rendezvous of the Syrian army. Junius conjectures
that it is the same with the Alamatha of Ptolemy (z), which he places
with the Trachonite Arabs near the Euphrates:

and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them:
before the whole combined army, which according to Josephus (a),
consisted of eighty thousand foot, and ten thousand horse: this general
is called Shophach, [Ch1 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#016.md) the
letters "B" and "P" being of the same pronunciation in the Hebrew
tongue, as Kimchi observes, though it is there read "Shobach", in the
Syriac and Arabic versions; he was no doubt a very able, valiant, and
skilful general, since he is particularly mentioned by name, and whose
name was then famous; the Arabic version calls him a spear bearer of
Hadarezer.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 10:17</span></span>

And when it was told David,.... What preparations the Syrians were
making to fight him, and where they were:

he gathered all Israel together; all the fighting men in the country:

and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam: which, according to Bunting
(b), was twenty miles from Jerusalem. David seems to have gone himself
in person to this war:

and the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with
him; they formed themselves in a line of battle, and attacked him first,
being eager to fight, and perhaps confident of victory, because of their
numbers.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 10:18</span></span>

And the Syrians fled before Israel,.... After an obstinate and bloody
fight between them:

and David slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians; the
word "men" is rightly supplied, for chariots could not be said to be
slain, but the men in them; in [Ch1
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#017.md), they are said to be seven
thousand, here seven hundred; which may be reconciled by observing, that
here the chariots that held the men are numbered, there the number of
the men that were in the chariots given, and reckoning ten men in a
chariot, seven hundred chariots held just seven thousand men; though
Kimchi takes another way of reconciling the two places, by observing
that here only the choicest chariots are mentioned, there all of them,
but the former way seems best:

and forty thousand horsemen; in [Ch1
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#017.md); it is forty thousand "footmen",
and so Josephus (c); and the same may be called both horse and foot, be
cause though they might come into the field of battle on horseback, yet
might dismount and fight on foot; and so one historian calls them
horsemen, and the other footmen; or the whole number of the slain, horse
and foot mixed together, were forty thousand; Kimchi makes use of
another way of removing this difficulty, and which perhaps is the best,
that here only the horsemen are numbered that were slain, and there the
footmen only, and both true; an equal number of each being slain, in all
eighty thousand, besides the seven thousand in the chariots:

and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who died there; of his
wounds upon the spot.

\(c\) Ut supra. (Antiqu. l. 7. c. 6. sect. 3.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa2 10:19</span></span>

And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer,.... That were
subject to him, and at his beck and command, at least were hired by him
into his service:

saw that they were smitten before Israel; could not stand their ground
against them, being too powerful for them:

they made peace with Israel, and served them; became tributaries to
them, whereby the promise of the land of Canaan made to Abraham and his
seed, as reaching to the river Euphrates, had its accomplishment, [Gen
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018.md),

so the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more; who
standing by themselves, they were soon and easily conquered by David's
forces, as recorded in the following chapters.
