### [2 Chronicles Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

INTRODUCTION TO 2 CHRONICLES 1

This chapter relates, how that Solomon being confirmed in his kingdom,
went to Gibeon to sacrifice [Ch2 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md),
that the Lord appeared there to him, and what passed between them, [Ch2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#007.md) and that when he returned from
thence to Jerusalem, he increased in splendour, wealth, and riches, [Ch2
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#013.md).

[2 Chronicles 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 1:1</span></span>

And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom,.... Well
settled and established on the throne of his father, after the death of
some persons, from whom he might expect trouble, see [Kg1
2:46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#046.md).

and the Lord God was with him; directing and instructing him, prospering
and succeeding him: the Targum is,"the Word of the Lord was his
help:''and magnified him exceedingly; see [Ch1
29:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#025.md).

[2 Chronicles 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 1:2</span></span>

Then Solomon spake unto all Israel,.... To their representatives about
going to Gibeon to sacrifice, as the next words show: so Jarchi and
Kimchi observe:

to the captains of thousands, and of hundreds, to the judges, and to
every governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers; whom he had
convened on this occasion; though some think this is the same
congregation gathered by his father, by whom he was anointed and made
king, and that he spoke of this to them before they broke up, [Ch1
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#001.md) which seems not so probable,
since it was after the death of his father, after he had been king some
time, and even after his marriage with Pharaoh's daughter, that what
follows was done, see [Kg1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#001.md).

[2 Chronicles 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 1:3</span></span>

So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place
that was at Gibeon,.... They agreed to his motion, and went with him
thither, see [Kg1 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#004.md).

for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the
servant of the Lord had made in the wilderness: by the Lord's direction;
where was also the altar of the Lord, and so most proper to offer
sacrifice on, which was what Solomon went thither to do; see [Ch1
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#029.md).

[2 Chronicles 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 1:4</span></span>

But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim,.... See [Sa2
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#002.md).

[2 Chronicles 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 1:5</span></span>

Moreover, the brasen altar that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur,
had made,.... According to the pattern given by Moses, at the direction
of God, [Exo 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#001.md),

he put before the tabernacle of the congregation; either David, or
rather Solomon; though it seems best to read the words as in the
Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions, "and there it was before the
tabernacle"; for it was always there:

and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it; to sacrifice unto it;
or rather sought "unto him", the Lord, before whose tabernacle the altar
was, so Gussetins (a).

[2 Chronicles 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 1:6</span></span>

And Solomon went up thither,.... To the high place at Gibeon:

to the brasen altar before the lord; where he used to be, and accept the
sacrifices of his people, though the ark, the symbol of his presence,
was not there:

which was at the tabernacle of the congregation; that is, which altar
was there; or rather "who", that is, God, was there, as Osiander,
hearing the prayers of his people, and accepting their offerings:

and offered a thousand offerings upon it; by the priests, see [Kg1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#004.md).

[2 Chronicles 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 1:7</span></span>

In that night did God appear unto Solomon,.... From hence to the end of
[Ch2 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#012.md) it is the same with [Kg1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#005.md). See Gill on [Kg1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#005.md), [Kg1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#006.md), [Kg1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#007.md), [Kg1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#008.md), [Kg1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#009.md), [Kg1
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#010.md), [Kg1
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#011.md), [Kg1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#012.md), [Kg1
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#013.md), [Kg1
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#014.md), [Kg1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#015.md)

[2 Chronicles 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 1:13</span></span>

Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at
Gibeon,.... Or rather without the supplement, the words may be read as
in the Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions:

Solomon came from the high places; having sacrificed there, so Vatablus;
being put for as R. Jonah observes (b); but the Targum agrees with us,
he"came to the high place which is in Gibeon, and from thence to
Jerusalem;''and to the same purpose Kimchi; having been there, he came
to Jerusalem:

from before the tabernacle of the congregation; which was at Gibeon,
where he had been sacrificing:

and reigned over Israel in great splendour and prosperity. From hence,
to the end of the chapter, the same things are said as in [Kg1
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026.md). See Gill on [Kg1
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026.md), [Kg1
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#027.md), [Kg1
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#028.md), [Kg1
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#029.md).
