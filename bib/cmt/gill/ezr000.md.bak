INTRODUCTION TO EZRA

This book, in the Vulgate Latin and Arabic versions, is called the
"First" Book of Ezra, Nehemiah being reckoned the "second"; but with the
Jews both were accounted but one book (a); in the Syriac version, it is
called the Writing or Book of Ezra the Prophet; and this title is given
him, both by Jews (b) and Christians (c); in the Arabic version, it is
called the First Book of Ezra the Priest, skilful in the Law; and that
he was a priest is clear, since he was the son of Seraiah the high
priest, who was slain by Nebuchadnezzar, and the younger brother of
Josedech, who succeeded his father as high priest, and uncle to Joshua
that succeeded him; and he was also a ready scribe in the law of Moses,
see [Ezr 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#001.md). That Ezra was the writer
of this book is believed by the Jews (d), and by the generality of
Christians; only Huetius (e) thinks that the six first chapters were
written by another hand, but his reasons are not satisfactory; and it
has been universally received as canonical by all; it agrees with the
prophecies of Haggai and Zechariah, and serves to illustrate them; it is
of use for the continuation of the sacred history, to point at the
fulfilment of prophecies concerning the return of the Jews from
captivity, and the rebuilding of the temple; and to give us an account
of the state of the church in those times, the troubles and difficulties
it met with, and what care was taken to keep the tribes and families
distinct, that it might be known from whom the Messiah sprung; this book
contains an history of seventy years, according to the calculation of
Bishop Usher (f), from A. M. 3468, to A. M. 3538.
