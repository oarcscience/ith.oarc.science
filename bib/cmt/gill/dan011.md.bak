INTRODUCTION TO DANIEL 11

In this chapter the angel makes good his promise to Daniel, that he
would show him what was written in the Scripture of truth, concerning
the monarchies of the earth, and what would befall his people the Jews
in the latter days; and after he had observed that he had strengthened
and confirmed Darius the Mede, who was the first king of the then
present flourishing monarchy, [Dan
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#001.md), he foretells the number of the
kings of Persia, and particularly describes the fourth, [Dan
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#002.md) predicts the rise of the Grecian
monarchy under Alexander the great, and the disposition of it after his
death, [Dan 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#003.md) and then proceeds to
give an account of the two principal kingdoms of that monarchy, into
which it was divided, the Seleucidae and Lagidae; and of their kings,
the king of Egypt, and the king of Syria, under the names of the king of
the south, and the king of the north, and of their power and agreement,
[Dan 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#005.md) and then of their various
wars between themselves and others, and the success of them, [Dan
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#007.md), and particularly of Antiochus,
his character and manner of coming to the kingdom, and of his wars with
the king of Egypt, and the issue of them, [Dan
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#021.md) and of his persecution of the
Jews, and the distress he should bring on them, and the use it should be
of to the godly among them, [Dan
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#030.md), and then his antitype,
antichrist, is described; the western antichrist, his character and
actions, [Dan 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036.md) then the eastern,
his power, wealth and riches, hail and rain, [Dan
11:40](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040.md).

[Daniel 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">dan 11:1</span></span>

Also I, in the first year of Darius the Mede,.... These words more
properly belong to the preceding chapter, and should have concluded
that, and the "eleventh" chapter should have begun in the next verse;
and they are not the words of Daniel, as Jerom and others; but of the
angel telling Daniel, not only what he had been lately doing, and would
do in the court of Persia for his people; but what he had done in the
beginning of that monarchy, the very first year that Darius the Mede
became king of Babylon, and head of the whole monarchy; see [Dan
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#030.md), the Septuagint and Arabic
versions render it, "in the first year of Cyrus"; which was the same
time; for Darius and Cyrus reigned together.

Even I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him; not Michael your Prince,
as Jarchi; for he being no other than the Son of God, an uncreated
Angel, needed not the help and assistance of a created one, nor could
receive any strength and confirmation from such an one; unless this is
to be understood, not with respect to Michael himself abstractly
considered, but as in relation to the people of the Jews, on whose side
Michael was; and so this angel took part with him and them, and as his
minister served them both, in defending them, and taking care of their
affairs at this time; so Jacchiades paraphrases it, to confirm and
strengthen Israel: but it seems rather to design Darius, and the sense
to be, that this angel strengthened Darius and Cyrus in their good
intentions to let the people of Israel go free and give them full
liberty and encouragement to go into their own land, and rebuild their
city and temple; about which some doubts and hesitations might arise in
their minds, and objections be made by some of their nobles and
courtiers to it, being moved and influenced by an evil spirit, the
adversary of this good angel; but he attended them so closely, and so
strongly suggested to them what they should do in this case, that he
carried his point on behalf of the Jews; for this respects not so much
the destruction of the Chaldean monarchy, and the establishing the
Persian monarchy on the ruins of it, and settling Darius on the throne,
and strengthening his kingdom and interest, as the confirmation of him
and Cyrus in their designs in favour of the Jews. The Syriac version is,
"from the first year of Darius the Mede, he rose up to help me, and
assist me"; as if the angel was still speaking of Michael, who came to
his help against the prince of Persia, and was the only one that held
with him, and had done so from the beginning of the Persian empire; but
the Hebrew text will not admit of such a translation.

[Daniel 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">dan 11:2</span></span>

And now will I show thee the truth,.... And nothing but the truth; what
will most certainly come to pass, and may be depended on, even what is
written in the book of God's decrees, "the Scripture of truth", and
which would appear in Providence in later times; and this he proposed to
deliver to him, not in figurative, dark, and obscure expressions, but
clearly and plainly, in language easy to be understood:

behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; which were
Cyrus, who reigned alone after the death of Darius the Mede, his uncle;
Cambyses, the son of Cyrus; and Darius Hystaspes. There was another
between Cambyses and Darius, called Smerdis the magician, who reigned
but seven months, and being an impostor is left out, as he is in
Ptolemy's canon; not that these were all the kings of Persia after
Darius the Mede; for, according to the above canon, there reigned six
more after them; but because these kings had a connection with the Jews,
and under them their affairs had different turns and changes, respecting
their restoration and settlement, and the building of their city and
temple; as also because these kings "stood", and the monarchy under them
was strong and flourishing, whereas afterwards it began to decline; and
chiefly it is for the sake of the fourth king that these are observed,
who laid the foundation of the destruction of the Persian monarchy by
the Grecians.

And the fourth shall be far richer than they all: this is Xerxes, who
exceeded his predecessors in wealth and riches; enjoying what they by
their conquests, or otherwise, had amassed together, to which he greatly
added; Cyrus had collected a vast deal of riches from various nations,
especially from Babylon: God gave him "the treasures of darkness, and
hidden riches of secret places", [Isa
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#003.md), Cambyses increased the store by
his victories, and the plunder of temples wherever he came; out of the
flames of which were saved three hundred talents of gold, and 2300
talents of silver, which he carried away, together with the famous
circle of gold that encompassed the tomb of King Ozymandias (d): and
Darius, the father of Xerxes, laid heavy taxes upon the people, and
hoarded up his money; hence he was called by the Persians (e), the
huckster or hoarder: and Xerxes came into it all, and so became richer
than them all; of whom Justin says (f).

"si regem species; divitias, non ducem laudes: quarum tanta copia in
regno ejus fuit, ut cum flumina multitudine consumerentur, opes tamen
regiae superessent.''

And by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the
realm of Grecia; through his vast riches, which are the sinews of war,
he collected a prodigious army out of all provinces, which he raised to
make war against the Grecians; being moved to it by Mardonius, a
relation of his, who was very ambitious of being at the head of a large
army (g); three years were spent in preparing for this expedition, and
forces were gathered out of all parts of the then known habitable world;
out of all the west, under Hamilcar, general of the Carthaginians, with
whom he made a league; and out of all the east, under his own command:
his army, according to Justin (h), consisted of 700,000 of his own, and
300,000 auxiliaries; Diodorus Siculus (i) makes it much less, to be
about 300,000 men; but Dr. Prideaux (k), from Herodotus and others,
computes, that putting all his forces together by sea and land, by the
time he came to the straits of Thermopylae the number of them were
2,641,610 men; and Grotius, from the same writer reckons them 5,283,000,
to which others add two hundred and twenty (l) with these he marched
into Greece, where, after having done much mischief, he was shamefully
defeated and obliged to retire, and was murdered by Artabanus the
captain of his guards. The words may be rendered (m), "he shall stir up
all, even the realm of Grecia"; by the preparation he made, and the vast
army he brought into the field, he raised all the cities and states of
Greece to combine together to withstand him; and this step of his is
what irritated the Grecians, and put them upon later attempts to avenge
themselves on the Persians for this attack upon them; and which they
never desisted from, till they had ruined the Persian empire, which they
did under Alexander; and so he, in his letter to Darius, says (n),

"your ancestors entered into Macedonia, and the other parts of Greece,
and did us damage, when they had received no affront from us as the
cause of it; and now I, created general of the Grecians, provoked by
you, and desirous of avenging the injury done by the Persians, have
passed over into Asia.''

And it is for the sake of this, the destruction of the Persian empire by
Alexander, that this expedition of Xerxes is here hinted at; and to pave
the way for the account of Alexander and his successors, in the
following part of this prophecy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">dan 11:3</span></span>

And a mighty king shall stand up,.... Not in Persia, but in Greece;
Alexander the great, who rose up a hundred years after the above
expedition of Xerxes, and "stood" and flourished, and conquered all he
attacked, none being able to resist him; and is rightly called a "mighty
king", a very powerful one: this is the notable horn in the he goat,
which being exasperated by the ram, the Persians, and their invasion of
Greece, pushed at them, and destroyed them, [Dan
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#005.md), that shall rule with great
dominion; not in Greece only but in the whole world, at least as he
thought, and really did over a very great part of it; for, as Jerome
says, having conquered the Illyrians, Thracians, Greece, and Thebes, he
passed into Asia; and, having put to flight the generals of Darius, he
took the city of Sardis, and afterwards India.

And do according to his will; not only in his own army, sacrificing his
best friends at his pleasure; but with his enemies, conquering whom he
would, none being able to withstand him; all things succeeded to his
wish; whatever he attempted he performed. His historian (o) says of him,

"that it must be owned he owed much to virtue, but more to fortune,
which alone of all mortals he had in his power;''

since, by the benefit of it, he seemed to do with nations whatever he
pleased; he was sovereign in all things, and set himself to be
worshipped as a deity.

[Daniel 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">dan 11:4</span></span>

And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken,.... When
Alexander was risen up to his highest pitch of grandeur, was sole
monarch of the world, in the height of his ambition, in the prime of his
days, he was cut off by death; his kingdom remained no more one, but
became many, was seized by different persons, his generals, and so broke
to pieces:

and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; which seem to have
respect to the four horns or kings, which came up in his place, [Dan
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#008.md), and among whom his kingdom was
parted; Ptolemy reigned in Egypt to the south; Antigonus in Asia to the
north; Seleucus in Babylon and Syria to the east; and Cassander in
Macedonia to the west:

and not to his posterity; for though he had two sons, one by Barsine,
whose name was Hercules, who was living at his death; and another by
Roxane, born after his death, whose name was Alexander; yet they were
both destroyed by Cassander, or his means, that he might enjoy Macedonia
(p):

nor according to his dominion which he ruled; their dominion was not so
large and powerful as Alexander's was, being divided into several parts;
see [Dan 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#022.md), for his kingdom shall
be plucked up, even for others besides those; either besides his
posterity, who had no share in it, and so, with respect to his family,
was like a tree plucked up by the roots, and, as to their concern in it,
withered away at once; or, besides the four governors before mentioned,
there were others that had, at least for a while, some lesser shares in
the kingdom, as Eumenes, Philotas, Leonnatus, and others; but, at
length, all were reduced to the kings of Egypt and Syria, the Lagidae
and Seleucidae, which the following part of the prophecy chiefly
concerns; and, besides these, for the Romans also, to whom this kingdom
came.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">dan 11:5</span></span>

And the king of the south shall be strong,.... That is, the king of
Egypt, which lay south to Syria, as Syria lay north to Egypt; and
therefore the king of the one is called the king of the south, and the
other the king of the north, throughout this prophecy; and by the king
of the south, or Egypt, is here meant Ptolemy Lagus, one of Alexander's
generals, who had Egypt for his share; and a very powerful king he was;
for he reigned over Egypt, Lybia, Cyrene, Ethiopia, Arabia, Phoenicia,
Coelesyria, Cyprus, and several isles in the Aegean sea, and many cities
in Greece:

and one of his princes; not of Ptolemy king of Egypt, but of Alexander
the great; and this is Seleucus Nicator, afterwards called king of the
north, having Syria for his part, which lay to the north of Egypt, as
before observed:

and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; that is, be a
greater and more powerful prince than Ptolemy king of Egypt:

his dominion shall be a great dominion; even greater than the others;
for he reigned over Macedonia, Greece, Thrace, Asia, Syria, Babylonia,
Media, and all the eastern countries as far as India; even from Taurus
to the river Indus, and so likewise from Taurus to the Aegean sea: these
two are only mentioned, who shared the Persian monarchy, because the
Jews were only affected by them, for the sake of whom this prophecy is
delivered.

[Daniel 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">dan 11:6</span></span>

And in the end of years they shall join themselves together,.... The two
kings of Egypt and Syria; not the two former kings, but their
successors: the king of Egypt was Ptolemy Philadelphus, the second king
of Egypt, the son of Ptolemy Lagus; this is the king of Egypt who
collected such a vast number of books into his library at Alexandria,
and got the law of Moses translated into Greek: the king of Syria was
Antiochus, surnamed Theos; this name was first given him by the
Milesians, upon his delivering them from the tyranny of Timarchus
governor of Caria; he was the third king of Syria; Seleucus Nicator the
first, Antiochus Soter the second, and this the third: there had been
very great wars between these kings for many years; and now, being weary
of them, they entered into confederacies and alliances with each other,
and which were designed to be strengthened by a marriage next mentioned;
this is thought to be about seventy years after the death of Alexander:
(q).

for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north
to make an agreement; this was Bernice, daughter of Ptolemy Philadelphus
king of Egypt, who carried her to Pelusium, and from thence sailed with
her to Seleucia in Syria; where he met with Antiochus king of Syria, to
whom he gave her in marriage, with a vast dowry of gold and silver;
hence she was called and the marriage was celebrated with great
solemnity (r): and this was "to make agreement", or "to make things
right or straight" (s); that were wrong and crooked before; to put an
end to wars and discords; to make peace and cultivate friendship; to
strengthen alliances, and confirm each other in their kingdoms:

but she shall not retain the power of the arm; unite the two kingdoms,
and secure the peace of them, which was the thing in view; nor retain
her interest in her husband, nor her power at court; for, as soon as her
father was dead, Antiochus dismissed Bernice from his bed, and took
Laodice his former wife again, by whom he had had two sons, Seleucus
Callinicus, and Antiochus Hierax (t):

neither shall he stand, nor his arm; neither Antiochus; for Laodice,
knowing that by the late treaty the crown was settled upon the children
of Bernice, who already had a son by him, and sensible of his
fickleness, and fearing he might divorce her again, and take to Bernice,
got him poisoned by his servants: nor Bernice his queen, called "his
arm"; who fleeing to Daphne for shelter, on hearing what was done, was
there slain; or it may be his son he had by her, so it follows:

but she shall be given up; into the hands of Seleucus Callinicus, the
son of Laodice; whom she placed on the throne after the death of his
father; and who sent to Daphne to slay Bernice, which was accordingly
done (u):

and they that brought her; into Syria; that attended her from Egypt at
her marriage, and continued with her in the court of Syria, and fled
with her to Daphne:

and he that begat her: or, "whom she brought forth"; as in the margin;
her little son, who was murdered at the same time with her; for her
father died before:

and he that strengthened her in these times; either her husband, or her
father, who were both dead before, and so stood not, and could not help
her; unless this is to be understood of her brother, and the cities of
the lesser Asia, who, hearing of her distress at Daphne, set out for her
relief, but came too late; she and her son were both slain first (w).

But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate,....
Or, "out of a branch of her roots a shoot thereof shall stand or rise
up" (x); by "her roots" are meant her ancestors, particularly Ptolemy
Lagus; by "a branch" from thence, Ptolemy Philadelphus her father; and
by the "shoot" out of that, or its plantation, as the Vulgate Latin
version, is designed her brother, Ptolemy Euergetes; who succeeded her
father in the kingdom, and stood firm in it; "upon his basis" (y), as
some render it:

which shall come with an army; or, "to an army" (z) as soon as he heard
of his sister's case, he put himself at the head of an army, and marched
to her relief; but coming too late, he, and the forces of the lesser
Asia, which came for the same purpose, joining him, resolved to revenge
the death of his sister and her son, went with his army into Syria, as
next foretold:

and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north; the king of
Syria, Seleucus Callinicus: Ptolemy entered into Syria itself, as
Polybius (a) says, into the fortified cities of it, and took them, the
singular being put for the plural; unless Seleucia itself is
particularly designed, which Ptolemy seized, and put a garrison of
Egyptians in it, which held it twenty seven years (b):

and shall deal against them; besiege and take them at his pleasure; the
king of Syria not being able to stand against him and defend them:

and shall prevail; over the king of Syria, and conquer great part of his
dominions, as he did: he took Syria and Cilicia, and the superior parts
beyond Euphrates, and almost all Asia, as Jerome relates; and had it not
been for a sedition in his own kingdom, which called him home, he had
made himself master of the whole kingdom of Seleucus, as Justin (c)
says.

And shall also carry captive into Egypt their gods, with their
princes,.... Jerom relates, from the historians he conversed with, that
Ptolemy carried captive with him into Egypt two thousand five hundred
images; among which were many of the idols which Cambyses, when he
conquered Egypt, carried from thence; and Ptolemy replacing them in
their proper temples, gained him the affection of his people the
Egyptians, who were much addicted to idolatry; hence they gave him the
name of Euergetes, that is, "the benefactor":

and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; the same writer
reports, that he brought with him out of Syria, and the places he
conquered, forty thousand talents of silver, and precious vessels;
vessels of gold and silver, a prodigious number:

and he shall continue more years than the king of the north; according
to the canon of Ptolemy, this king of Egypt reigned twenty five years;
and, as Dr. Prideaux (d) observes, outlived Seleucus king of Syria four
years.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">dan 11:9</span></span>

So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom,.... Into his own
kingdom, the kingdom of Egypt; or into the kingdom of Syria, the kingdom
of Seleucus, and conquer great part of it, and ravage and spoil it:

and shall return into his own land; the land of Egypt; he shall go and
come with ease, and as he pleases, none to hinder him; and come back
with a great spoil, as before related: Cocceius renders it, and
something "shall come in the kingdom of the king of the south, and he
shall return to his own land"; and thinks this refers to the sedition
raised there, before mentioned, which obliged him to return sooner than
he intended. The Septuagint and Arabic versions render it, "and he shall
enter into the kingdom of the king of the south, and he shall return to
his own land": that is, Seleucus should attempt to enter into the
kingdom of Ptolemy king of Egypt, in revenge of his having entered into
his country and spoiled it; but shall be obliged to return to his own
land without any success: and so Justin (e) says, that he fitted out a
great fleet, which was destroyed by a violent storm; and after this he
raised a great army to recover his dominion, but was defeated by
Ptolemy, and fled in great terror and trembling to Antioch; and this
suits well with what follows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">dan 11:10</span></span>

But his sons shall be stirred up,.... Not of the king of the south, or
Egypt, but of the king of the north, or Syria; the sons of Seleucus
Callinicus, who died, as Justin (f) says, by a fall from his horse;
these were Seleucus Ceraunus and Antiochus, who was afterwards called
the great: these being irritated and provoked by what Ptolemy Euergetes
had done in revenge of his sister, taking part of their father's kingdom
from him, and carrying off so rich a booty, joined together, and exerted
themselves to recover their dominions from him:

and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: or, "a multitude of men,
even large armies" (g); which they put themselves at the head of, in
order to make war with the king of Egypt:

and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through; this is to
be understood of Antiochus; for Seleucus dying in the third year of his
reign, being slain in Phrygia, through the treachery of Nicator and
Apaturius, as Jerom relates; or, as others, poisoned; Antiochus
succeeded him, and alone headed the armies they had collected; and with
which, like an inundation of water, to which armies are sometimes
compared, he attacked Seleucia, and took it; and entered into
Coelesyria, and overran it, being delivered into his hands by the
treachery of Theodotus, who governed there for Ptolemy, whom he had
offended: after this he came to Berytus, entered the province by a place
which the countrymen called "the face of God"; and which Grotius, not
improbably, takes to be Phanuel: took the town of Botris, and set fire
to Trieres and Calamus, or Calene: he next invaded Palestine, and took
several places in it; went as far as Rabata Massane, or Rabatamana, a
city in Arabia, the same with Rabbathammon, which surrendered to him
(h):

then shall he return, and be stirred up even to his fortress: the spring
following he returned with a numerous army, and came to Raphia, a
fortified city in Egypt, which lay between that and Palestine; where, as
Strabo (i) says, Ptolemy the fourth (i.e. Philopator) fought with
Antiochus the great.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">dan 11:11</span></span>

And the king of the south shall be moved with choler,.... This is
Ptolemy Philopator, who succeeded Ptolemy Euergetes in the kingdom of
Egypt; so called ironically, because of his murder of his father and
mother, as Justin (k) relates; the same, though naturally sluggish and
slothful, was provoked and exasperated at the proceedings of Antiochus,
retaking Coelesyria, invading Palestine, and coming up to the borders of
his kingdom:

and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the
north: he assembled an army, and marched with them, from the interior
part of his kingdom, to the border of it, to Raphia, a city between
Rhinocorura and Gaza; where he met with Antiochus, and a battle was
fought, as before observed:

and he shall set forth a great multitude; this is true of both kings,
their armies were very large; that of Ptolemy king of Egypt consisted,
according to Polybius (l), of seventy thousand foot, five thousand
horse, and seventy three elephants and that of Antiochus king of Syria
consisted of sixty two (some say seventy two) thousand foot, six
thousand horse, and a hundred and two elephants: the former army, that
of the king of Egypt, seems rather designed, if the preceding clause is
consulted; though the latter, that of Antiochus, best agrees with what
follows:

but the multitude shall be given into his hand: that is, the multitude
of the army of Antiochus should be delivered into the hands of Ptolemy
Philopator, and so it was; for Antiochus lost ten thousand footmen, and
three hundred horsemen; four thousand footmen were taken, three
elephants slain, and two wounded, which afterwards died, and most of the
rest were taken (m): this victory is ascribed to Arsinoe, the sister and
wife of Ptolemy, who ran about the army with her hair dishevelled, and
by entreaties and promises greatly encouraged the soldiers to fight; of
which see third Maccabees chapter one and with which Polybius (n)
agrees.

That is, when Ptolemy king of Egypt had defeated the large army of
Antiochus, killed great numbers of them, and taken many:

his heart shall be lifted up; with pride, through the victory he
obtained; and so he gave himself up to sensuality and luxury, judging
himself now safe and secure in the possession of his kingdom: or, this
may refer to his insolence, when he entered into Judea, went to
Jerusalem, and forced his way into the holiest of all to offer sacrifice
upon his victory; of which see third Maccabees chapter one:

and he shall cast down many ten thousands; or "many thousands", as the
Vulgate Latin version; or rather "ten thousand" (m), either of the Jews,
when he went into their country; or of the army of Antiochus the king of
the north, as Jacchiades: and it may be rendered, "though he shall cast
down many thousands" (n); that is, cast them down to the earth, slay
them, as he did, even ten thousand of them, the number here mentioned:

yet he shall not be strengthened by it; for Antiochus escaped out of his
hands, nor did he pursue his victory, and take all the advantages of it,
as he might have done; for, as the historian (o) says, had he added
valour to his fortune, he might have spoiled Antiochus of his kingdom;
but, content with the recovery of the cities he lost, made peace, and
greedily took the advantage of ease, and rolled himself in luxury,
uncleanness, and intemperance.

For the king of the north shall return,.... As Antiochus king of Syria
did, upon the death of Ptolemy Philopator, who was succeeded by his son
Ptolemy Epiphanes, a minor of five years of age: Antiochus took the
advantage of this minority, and entered into a league with Philip king
of Macedon, to divide the kingdom of Egypt between them; and marched an
army into Coelesyria and Palestine, and made himself master of those
countries:

and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former; bring a larger
army into the field than he had done before, which Jerom says he brought
out of the upper parts of Babylon; some say it consisted of three
hundred thousand footmen, besides horsemen and elephants:

and shall certainly come (after certain years) with a great army, and
with much riches; with all manner of provisions to supply his numerous
army, and all proper accommodations for it; money to pay his soldiers,
and beasts of burden to carry their baggage from place to place: this
was about fourteen years after the former battle, as Dr. Prideaux (p)
observes; and, according to Bishop Usher's annals, thirteen years.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">dan 11:14</span></span>

And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the
south,.... The king of Egypt, Ptolemy Epiphanes being a minor; and while
he was such, Antiochus king of Syria, and Philip king of Macedon, joined
in alliance together, as before observed, to seize upon his kingdom, and
divide it between them; and accordingly Antiochus began the war in
Coelesyria and Phoenicia, and Philip went against Egypt and Samos, or
Caria, according to Polybius (q). Agathocles and Agathoclea, favourites
of the former king of Egypt, laid a scheme of taking the regency into
their hands during the minority of the young king; and these, being
persons of dissolute lives, were hated by the Egyptians, which caused
insurrections and seditions among themselves; and Scopas, a principal
general in the army of the king of Egypt, formed a design of taking the
government to himself:

also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the
vision: this is directed to the Prophet Daniel, and respects the Jews
his countrymen, at least some of them, refractory persons that broke
through all laws of God and men; seditious men, disturbers of the public
peace, and who lived upon the spoil and plunder of others; these either
took the advantage of the disturbances in Egypt, and went thither, and
plundered what they could, in a bold and audacious manner, and so helped
to fulfil this prophecy; or during the troubles in their own land,
through the kings of Egypt and Syria, took the opportunity of committing
thefts and robberies in a very daring manner, whereby they brought upon
them those evils threatened in the law to such persons; and particularly
when the Egyptians prevailed, they sided with them against Antiochus,
especially such who apostatized from their religion to please the king
of Egypt; but were afterwards punished by Antiochus, as it follows:

but they shall fall: be cut off and destroyed, as those apostates that
were of Ptolemy's party were by Antiochus, when he invaded Judea, and
became master of Jerusalem; see third Maccabees chapter one. Some
understand this of the apostate Jews, who fled with Onias the high
priest to Egypt, and were there honourably received by Ptolemy, and
obtained leave to build a temple there, under pretence of fulfilling the
vision or prophecy in [Isa 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#019.md),
which continued many years to the times of the Romans, by whom it was
destroyed; but this does not agree with the reign of this king of Egypt;
for it was in the times of Ptolemy Philometor that this affair happened,
as Josephus (r) relates. Sir Isaac Newton interprets it of the
Samaritans (s).

So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and take the
most fenced cities,.... That is, Antiochus the great, king of Syria,
should come into Coelesyria and Phoenicia, which was the part of the
kingdom of Egypt he was to have by the league with Philip king of
Macedon; and this is a prophecy of his expedition into those parts, and
the success of it. Scopas, a general of Ptolemy, being sent by him into
Coelesyria, had took many of the cities of it, and the land of Judea;
but Antiochus, coming into those parts with his army, beat Scopas at the
fountains of Jordan, and destroyed great part of his forces, and retook
the cities of Coelesyria that Scopas had made himself master of, and
subdued Samaria; upon which the Jews voluntarily submitted to him, and
received him into their city, as Josephus (t) relates; and Polybius (u),
as quoted by him, says, that Scopas being conquered by Antiochus, he
took Batanea, Samaria, Abila, and Godara, and that the Jews in a little
time surrendered to him; and so Livy says (w), that Antiochus reduced
all the cities that Ptolemy had in Coelesyria into subjection to him;
and these are the most fenced cities pointed at in this prophecy,
against which the king of Syria cast up mounts, in order to take them;
or placed battering engines before them, as the word also signifies, as
Kimchi observes (x), by which stones were cast into the besieged cities:

and the arms of the south shall not withstand, neither his chosen
people, neither shall there be any strength to withstand; all the forces
of the king of Egypt mustered together would not be able to withstand
the power of Antiochus, who would, as he did, carry all before him; not
their most powerful armies, nor most courageous generals, nor valiant
soldiers, the choicest of them, nor any auxiliaries called in to their
assistance; for when Scopas was beaten by Antiochus at Jordan, he fled
to Sidon with ten thousand soldiers, where he was shut up in a close
siege; and though Ptolemy sent his famous and choicest commanders to his
relief, Eropus, Menocles, and Damoxenus, as Jerome relates; yet they
were not able to raise the siege, but by famine were forced to
surrender; and he and his men were dismissed naked.

But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and
none shall stand before him,.... Antiochus the great, who came against
Ptolemy king of Egypt, would do in those parts where he came as he
pleased; take cities, and dispose of them at his pleasure; the army of
the king of Egypt not being able to oppose him, and stop his conquests
in Coelesyria and Phoenicia; nor should they hinder his entrance into
Judea:

and he shall stand in the glorious land; Judea, so called, not only
because of its fertility, but chiefly because of the worship of God in
it; here Antiochus stood as a victorious conqueror; the Jews readily
submitting to him, and received him into their city, and assisted him in
reducing the castle where Scopas had placed a garrison of soldiers:

which by his hand shall be consumed; by his numerous army, and the
foraging of his soldiers, eating up and destroying the fruits of the
earth wherever they came; otherwise the land of Judea, and the
inhabitants of it, were not consumed and destroyed by him at this time;
but rather brought into more flourishing circumstances, having many
favours and privileges bestowed on them by him, on account of the
respect they showed him; for, on his coming to Jerusalem, the priests
and elders went out to meet him, and gladly received him and his army,
and furnished him with horses and elephants, and helped him in reducing
the garrison Scopas had left (y), as before observed: hence some render
the words, "which by his hand was perfected" (z); restored to perfect
peace and prosperity, which had been for some years harassed and
distressed by the Egyptians and Syrians, in their turns being masters of
it; the elders, priests, and Levites, he freed from tribute, gave them
leave to live according to their own laws, granted them cattle and other
things for sacrifice, and wood for the repairing and perfecting of their
temple. The letters he wrote on this account are to be seen in Josephus
(a).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">dan 11:17</span></span>

He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole
kingdom,.... Antiochus, having conquered Coelesyria, Phoenicia, and
Judea, should set his face towards the land of Egypt, having a greedy
desire after it, and bend his mind and forces that way; form a design of
invading it, and for that purpose determine to bring all the forces he
could master together throughout his dominions. So Justin (b) says, that
upon the death of Ptolemy Philopator, Antiochus king of Syria determined
to seize on Egypt. The Vulgate Latin version is, "that he might come to
lay hold on his whole kingdom"; to seize the whole kingdom of the king
of Egypt:

and upright ones with him: meaning, as many think, the Jews, so called
to distinguish them from the Heathens, and even from those Jews who had
took on the side of Ptolemy, and had changed their religion; but these
persevered in it, which Antiochus approved of; and had now a great
opinion of them, and had bestowed many favours upon them, as before
observed; wherefore he might take some of them, and they might choose to
go with him on this expedition, and especially to assist in his intended
agreement with the king of Egypt, and the marriage of his daughter to
him; in bringing about which they were to have a concern, as being
reckoned men of probity and uprightness: or rather the sense is,
according to the Vulgate Latin version,

and he shall do right things; in show and appearance: or "he shall make
agreement", or peace, as Aben Ezra; enter into covenants of alliance and
marriage, upon seeming just conditions, with a great show of sincerity
and uprightness:

thus shall he do; in the following manner: or, "and he shall do" (c);
that is, succeed in his proposals:

and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her; this was
the stratagem he used; finding he could not obtain the kingdom of Egypt
by force of arms, for fear of the Romans, who were the guardians of the
king of Egypt, he proposed to give his daughter Cleopatra to him in
marriage, a beautiful virgin; and therefore called the "daughter of
women"; or rather because she was as yet under the care of the women she
was first committed to, as Gussetius (d) observes; and so he did marry
her, and gave for her dowry Coelesyria, Samaria, Judea, and Phoenicia
(e): this was done at Raphia (f), a fortified city of Egypt, where the
famous battle had been fought between him and Ptolemy Philopator; see
[Dan 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#010.md) and if the former clause is
rendered, as I think it may, "he shall also set his face to enter into
the fortress of the whole kingdom"; this is the place intended, where he
was desirous of going to meet the king of Egypt, and execute this scheme
of his; which, though done under a plausible pretence of peace, and of
putting ahead to their quarrels, was with a view to get his kingdom into
his hands; "corrupting" his daughter to betray the counsels of her
husband; or to put him to death by poison, or otherwise, that he might
seize the kingdom on her behalf; or it may be rendered, to "corrupt" or
"destroy it" (g), the kingdom; he married his daughter to the king of
Egypt with this view, to obtain the kingdom from him:

but she shall not stand on his side, neither be for him; being married,
she forgot her own people, and her father's house, and cleaved to her
husband; took his part, and not her father's, yea, took part with her
husband against her father; for ambassadors were sent out of Egypt by
both her husband and herself, congratulating the Romans on the victory
Acilius gained over Antiochus her father, and that he had drove him out
of Greece, exhorting them to carry their army into Asia (h); and thus he
was disappointed of his design in this marriage: and this may be the
meaning of the expression here; for it may be rendered, "it shall not
stand" (i); his counsel shall not stand, his scheme shall not take
place, but fall to the ground, and come to nothing:

and it shall not be for him; the kingdom shall not be his, he shall
never possess it, as he did not.

After this he shall turn his face unto the isles, and shall take
many,.... Finding himself disappointed in his design on the kingdom of
Egypt, he turned his face, and steered his course another way, and with
a large fleet sailed into the Aegean sea; and, as Jerom relates, took
Rhodes, Samos, Colophon, and Phocea, and many other islands; and also
several cities of Greece and Asia, which lay on the sea coasts; it being
usual with the Jews to call such maritime places islands:

but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him
to cease; the reproach that Antiochus cast upon the Romans, by seizing
on their provinces, taking their cities, doing injuries to their allies,
and treating their ambassadors with contempt: this the Romans wiped off
by taking up arms against him, and gaining victories over him both by
sea and land. The "prince" here may design the Romans in general, who,
on their own behalf, or for their own honour, sent out armies and fleets
against him, to put a stop to his insults over them; or some particular
leader and commander of theirs, not a king, but a general or admiral, as
Marcus Acilius, who beat him at the straits of Thermopylae; also Livius
Salinator, who got the victory over his fleet about Phocea, where he
sunk ten of his ships, and took thirteen; likewise Aemilius Regillus,
who got the better of his fleet at Myonnesus, near Ephesus; and
especially Lucius Scipio, who, in a land fight, beat him at Mount
Siphylus, with an army of thirty thousand against seventy thousand,
killed fifty thousand footmen of Antiochus's army, and four thousand
horsemen, and took fourteen hundred prisoners, with fifteen elephants
and their commanders (k), and so drove him out of lesser Asia:

without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon him; without any
reproach to the Roman general; the reproach which Antiochus cast upon
the Roman nation was turned upon his own head, by the many victories
obtained over him by sea and land, and especially by the last and total
defeat of him; for no other terms of peace could he obtain, but to pay
all the expenses of the war, quit all Asia on that side Taurus, and give
hostages, and his own son was one, in the Apocrypha:

"10 And there came out of them a wicked root Antiochus surnamed
Epiphanes, son of Antiochus the king, who had been an hostage at Rome,
and he reigned in the hundred and thirty and seventh year of the kingdom
of the Greeks.'' (1 Maccabees 1:10)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">dan 11:19</span></span>

Then he shall turn his face towards the fort of his own land,.... After
his defeat he fled with a few to Sardis, and from thence to Apamea, so
Livy; and to Susa, and to the further parts of his dominions, as Jerom;
or rather he betook himself to Antioch his capital city, called here
"the fort of his own land", where he was obliged to continue:

but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found; the expenses of the war
which Antiochus agreed to pay being reckoned at fifteen thousand Euboean
talents, five hundred talents were to be paid down; two thousand five
hundred at the ratification of the treaty by the senate of Rome; and the
other twelve thousand to be paid yearly, at a thousand talents each
year: now, being either in want of money, or through covetousness, he
attempted to rob the temple of Jupiter Elymaeus, and went by night
thither with his army for that purpose; but the thing being betrayed,
the inhabitants got together, and slew him, with all his soldiers, as
Justin (l) relates. Strabo (m) says, that Antiochus the great
endeavouring to rob the temple of Bel, the barbarians near to (Elymais)
rose of themselves, and slew him; and so never returned to Syria any
more, but died in the province of Elymais, being slain by the Persians
there, as related, and was never found more, or was buried; and this was
the end of this great man, of whom so many things are said in this
prophecy, and others follow concerning his successors. He died in the
thirty seventh year of his reign, and the fifty second of his age (n).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">dan 11:20</span></span>

Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the
kingdom,.... This was not Antiochus Epiphanes, as Theodoret, he is
designed in the next verse; nor Ptolemy Epiphanes; as Porphyry, for he
did not succeed Antiochus the great; nor Tryphon, tutor to Antiochus, as
some Jewish writers; but Seleucus Philopator, the eldest son of
Antiochus the great; who succeeded him, and was settled in his kingdom
in his father's room, and stood upon his basis; and might well be called
a raiser of taxes, being not only a covetous man, and a lover of money
above all things; and therefore laid heavy taxes on his subjects, to
gratify his avarice; but was indeed obliged to it, to raise the thousand
talents yearly to pay the Romans, which his father had laid himself
under obligation to do; and this took up the whole life of this his
successor; for as there were twelve thousand talents to pay, a thousand
each year, and Seleucus reigned in all but twelve years at most, he did
nothing but raise taxes yearly to pay this tribute. It may be rendered,
"then shall stand upon his basis": or, "in his room", as the Vulgate
Latin version, in the room of Antiochus the great, "one that causes the
exactors to pass through the glory of the kingdom" (o); that causes tax
gatherers to go through the kingdom, and collect the tax of the people,
who are the glory of the kingdom, especially the rich, the nobility, and
gentry; or money, which is the glory of a nation: or, "shall cause the
exactors to pass over to the glory of the kingdom"; that is, cause a tax
gatherer to go over from Syria to the glorious land, or the glorious
part of his dominion, the land of Judea; and so may have respect
particularly to Heliodorus his treasurer, whom he sent to Jerusalem to
demand the treasure of money he heard was laid up in the temple there;
in the Apocrypha:

"Now when Apollonius came to the king, and had shewed him of the money
whereof he was told, the king chose out Heliodorus his treasurer, and
sent him with a commandment to bring him the foresaid money.'' (2
Maccabees 3:7)

but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in
battle; or, within a few years, as Grotius and Prideaux render it;
"days" being often put for years. Seleucus reigned but twelve years at
most, which were but few in comparison of the long reign of his father,
which was a reign of thirty seven years; and he died not through the
rage of the populace, or through the sedition and rebellion of his
subjects, nor in war, with a foreign enemy; but through the treachery of
Heliodorus his treasurer, by whom he was poisoned, as is supposed;
either for the sake of Antiochus Epiphanes, who was at that very time
returning from Rome, where he had been an hostage ever since the defeat
of his father, the money being now paid, which was stipulated; or rather
on his own account, having a design to seize the kingdom for himself.

And in his estate shall stand up a vile person,.... Upon his basis or
stand, in the same place where Seleucus Philopator stood, succeeded
Antiochus Epiphanes his brother, called "vile", being a very immoral
man, given to drunkenness, lasciviousness, uncleanness, and unnatural
lusts, and a violent persecutor of the church of God. The word signifies
"despicable" (p); he was a vile person, and justly condemned for his
vices, and also for that mean and ignoble life he had lived at Rome,
having been an hostage there for eleven or twelve years; and though the
other hostages were changed at three years' end, yet he remained; which
shows what little account he was of even with his father; and was in no
esteem with the people, among whom, by his freaks and frolics, he made
himself very ridiculous; by rambling about streets with a servant or
two; conversing with tradesmen about their trades; drinking with
strangers, and people of low life; revelling at merry bouts with young
people; putting on strange habits; throwing away his money among the
rabble, and stones at those that followed him; washing at public baths
among the common people; all which, and many others, are reported (q) of
him by historians; hence he was called by some Epimanes the madman;
though he took to himself the title of Epiphanes the "illustrious", the
reverse of his character. This is the little horn in [Dan
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#009.md) and who was an eminent type of
antichrist, with whom his character agrees, as well as other things:

to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom; neither his
father, nor his brother, nor the peers and people of the land of the
kingdom of Syria; they never once thought of making him king; they
neither chose him, nor called him, nor crowned him:

but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries;
pretending to take it, not for himself, but for his nephew Demetrius,
the son of his brother Seleucus, now an hostage at Rome, in his stead;
so that the states opposed him not, but quietly admitted him, thinking
all was safe for the rightful heir and successor; and when he had got
possession for his nephew, he obtained it for himself by his flattering
speeches to the nobles, and his gifts among the citizens, and his great
pretensions to clemency and humanity; or these "flatteries" may refer to
the artifices he used to gain Eumenes king of Pergamus, and Attalus his
brother, to assist him against Heliodorus the usurper; and the promises
of friendship and assistance against the Romans he made to them, and by
whose help he came peaceably to the kingdom.

And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him,
and shall be broken,.... That is, by the help of the forces of Eumenes
and Attalus, which were like an inundation of water, the party that were
on the side of Heliodorus the usurper were bore down, crushed, and
destroyed; and thereby Antiochus had a peaceable settlement in the
kingdom: or, "the arms of a flood shall be overflowed from before him,
and be broken" (r); either the arms of Heliodorus, the forces he had got
together; or the armies of the Egyptians, which, like an overflowing
flood, had used to run over Judea, Coelesyria, Phoenicia, and other
places, and carry all before them, now should be overflowed, and bore
down themselves; of which see more on [Dan
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#025.md),

yea, also the prince of the covenant; which some understand of Judas
Maccabaeus, as Jerome and Jacchiades; others more probably of Onias the
high priest, whom Antiochus deposed in the first year of his reign, and
sold the priesthood to Jason his younger brother for four hundred and
forty talents of silver; and who also promised to give him one hundred
and fifty more for a license to erect a place of exercise for the
training up of youth, according to the fashion of the Greeks; which
Antiochus greedily embraced, the public treasury being empty through the
large tribute paid to the Romans the last twelve years; in the
Apocrypha:

"7 But after the death of Seleucus, when Antiochus, called Epiphanes,
took the kingdom, Jason the brother of Onias laboured underhand to be
high priest, 8 Promising unto the king by intercession three hundred and
threescore talents of silver, and of another revenue eighty talents: 9
Beside this, he promised to assign an hundred and fifty more, if he
might have licence to set him up a place for exercise, and for the
training up of youth in the fashions of the heathen, and to write them
of Jerusalem by the name of Antiochians. 34 Wherefore Menelaus, taking
Andronicus apart, prayed, him to get Onias into his hands; who being
persuaded thereunto, and coming to Onias in deceit, gave him his right
hand with oaths; and though he were suspected by him, yet persuaded he
him to come forth of the sanctuary: whom forthwith he shut up without
regard of justice. 35 For the which cause not only the Jews, but many
also of other nations, took great indignation, and were much grieved for
the unjust murder of the man.'' (2 Maccabees 4)

Others think Seleucus Philopator his brother is meant, which is not
probable, his death being before described; rather Demetrius his nephew,
with whom he covenanted to hold the kingdom for him, or through whom the
covenant and peace with the Romans was continued so long, he being an
hostage at Rome; though others are of opinion that Trypho, a peer of the
realm of Egypt, is designed, who was the principal person concerned in a
covenant made between Antiochus and Ptolemy Philometor king of Egypt;
though it is more likely that Ptolemy himself is the person intended.

And after the league made with him,.... The prince of the covenant;
either Demetrius his nephew, or Ptolemy Philometor king of Egypt, with
whom a league was made in the lifetime of Cleopatra, the sister of
Antiochus, and mother of Ptolemy:

he shall work deceitfully; either with the princes and people of Syria,
by good words and fair speeches, and by gifts and presents, to get the
kingdom for himself, though he had covenanted with his nephew to hold it
for him, and resign it to him at his return; and with the Romans, and
among his friends in the senate, he artfully worked to detain him at
Rome: or else with the king of Egypt, pretending great friendship to
him, and to take the care and tuition of him during his minority; and at
his coronation he sent one Apollonius to be present at it, and to
congratulate him upon it; in the Apocrypha:

"Now when Apollonius the son of Menestheus was sent into Egypt for the
coronation of king Ptolemeus Philometor, Antiochus, understanding him
not to be well affected to his affairs, provided for his own safety:
whereupon he came to Joppa, and from thence to Jerusalem:'' (2 Maccabees
4:21)

for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people;
either he went into the heart of Syria with a small number of men at
first, and gathered together a large army; or into Phoenicia with a
handful of men, where he ingratiated himself into the affections of the
people by words and gifts, and became strong; or he went up into Egypt
accompanied only with a few, lest, the Egyptians should be suspicious of
him; but these it is said were valiant men, whom he placed in the forts
of Egypt, and so became master of it, which is an instance of his
deceitful working; and Sutorius, an ancient historian, as quoted by
Jerom, says that he subdued Egypt to himself with a very small number of
people.

[Daniel 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">dan 11:24</span></span>

He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the
province,.... Or, "into tranquillity, and the fattest places of the
province" (s); that is, into such places as were in great tranquillity,
and men thought themselves safe and secure, and had no suspicion of his
designs upon them, and which abounded in wealth and riches: these were
either the principal cities in the kingdom of Syria, which he visited in
order to establish himself in their good opinion of him; or the chief
places of the province of Phoenicia, where he endeavoured to make
himself acceptable by his munificence; or it may be the best parts of
the kingdom of Egypt are meant, the richest of them, such as Memphis,
and the places about it; where, as Sutorius in Jerome says, he went; and
which places being fat, producing a large increase, and abounding in
wealth, invited him thither; and which wealth he took, and scattered
among his friends and soldiers, as in a following clause:

and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers'
fathers; none of his ancestors, more near or more remote; not Antiochus
the great, nor Seleucus Ceraunus, nor Seleucus Callinicus, nor Antiochus
Theos, nor Antiochus Soter, nor Seleucus Nicator, the founder of the
Syrian empire; for, however greater these might be in power or riches,
they were inferior to him in success; though they all, or most of them,
however, had their eye upon Egypt, and would gladly have been masters of
it; yet none of the kings of Syria prevailed over it, as Antiochus did;
and this may also refer to what follows:

he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and riches; which he
took from the places or rich cities he entered into; and these he
plentifully and liberally dispersed among his followers, his soldiers,
"the small people" he became strong with, [Dan
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#023.md), whereby he gained their
affections, and attached them to his interest; and in this his
liberality and munificence he is said to abound above all the kings that
were before him, in the Apocrypha:

"He feared that he should not be able to bear the charges any longer,
nor to have such gifts to give so liberally as he did before: for he had
abounded above the kings that were before him.'' (1 Maccabees 3:30)

and the character Josephus (t) gives of him is, that he was a man of a
large and liberal heart:

yea, and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds; the
fortresses of Egypt; as he got into the fat and richest parts of it, and
distributed the wealth of them among his favourites and followers, which
answered a good purpose; so he had his eye upon the fortified places of
the kingdom, and contrived ways and means to get them into his
possession, as Pelusium, and other places; and how to keep them when he
had got them, which he did:

even for a time; till Ptolemy Philometor was at age, and freed himself
from him; or till the Romans (u) put a stop to his power.

And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the
south with a great army,.... That is, Antiochus shall arouse himself,
and exert his courage, and gather a large and powerful army, and set out
with them to fight with Ptolemy Philometor, king of Egypt; this is his
second expedition into Egypt, as is observed in the Apocrypha:

"About the same time Antiochus prepared his second voyage into Egypt:''
(2 Maccabees 5:1)

before he went into Egypt more privately, with a few men, under a
pretence of friendship; but now more openly as an enemy, with a large
army; so it is said in the Apocrypha:

"17 Wherefore he entered into Egypt with a great multitude, with
chariots, and elephants, and horsemen, and a great navy, 18 And made war
against Ptolemee king of Egypt: but Ptolemee was afraid of him, and
fled; and many were wounded to death.'' (1 Maccabees 1)

and he entered into Egypt with a great multitude, with chariots, and
with elephants, and with horses, and with a great fleet; which account
exactly agrees with this prophecy, and serves to illustrate it:

and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very
great and mighty army; this is Ptolemy Philometor, king of Egypt, who,
hearing of the preparations of Antiochus, and of his design to enter his
kingdom, gathered a large army together to give him battle:

but he shall not stand; the king of Egypt could not stand against
Antiochus; the two armies met between Mount Casius and Pelusium, where
they came, to a battle, and Antiochus got the victory: upon his second
victory over the forces of Ptolemy, he took Pelusium, and led his army
into the very heart of the kingdom, and had it in his power to have cut
off all the Egyptians, to a man; he made himself master of Memphis, and
all the rest of Egypt, except Alexandria, which held out against him
(w):

for they shall forecast devices against him; Antiochus, and those that
assisted him with their counsels, formed schemes against Ptolemy, which
succeeded: the loss of the battle was not owing to want of the necessary
preparations for it; or to an insufficient number of men; or to a defect
of military skill and courage; but to the treachery of his own courtiers
and commanders, particularly Eulaeus and Lennaeeus to whom the blame was
laid, and to the desertion of Ptolemy Macron; which is more clearly
expressed in the following verse.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">dan 11:26</span></span>

Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him,....
Those of his own household, his familiar friends, his courtiers and
counsellors, and the generals of his army; his destruction, or the loss
of the battle, was owing either to the bad counsels they gave him, or to
their desertion of him, being corrupted by Antiochus:

and his army shall overflow: that is, the army of Antiochus, like a
mighty inundation of water, which carries all before it, should
overflow, or bear down and destroy, the army of Ptolemy, and overrun all
Egypt, as it did, as before related; no more resistance being to be made
to it than to a rapid flood of water:

and many shall fall down slain: of the army of the king of Egypt. The
account given of this affair in the Apocrypha:

"18 And made war against Ptolemee king of Egypt: but Ptolemee was afraid
of him, and fled; and many were wounded to death. 19 Thus they got the
strong cities in the land of Egypt and he took the spoils thereof.'' (1
Maccabees 1)

Josephus says (x), that Antiochus,

"being with a great army at Pelusium, and circumventing Ptolemy
Philometor by fraud, seized on Egypt; and being in the parts near to
Memphis, and taking it, he hastened to Alexandria to besiege it, and got
Ptolemy, reigning there, into his hands.''

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">dan 11:27</span></span>

And both these kings' hearts shall be to do mischief,.... Antiochus
Epiphanes, king of Syria, and Ptolemy Philometor, king of Egypt, the
latter being now in the hands of the former; whether he was taken by
him, or voluntarily came to him, is not certain; but though they seemed
to carry it very friendly to one another, yet at the same time they were
contriving in their minds to do as much mischief to each other as they
could:

and they shall speak lies at one table: at an entertainment at Memphis,
where they met to eat food together, which shows great familiarity; or
at the council table, where they pretended to consult each other's good,
and to secure the peace of both kingdoms, but imposed on each other with
lies. Antiochus pretended a great respect for Ptolemy, and that he had
nothing more at heart than to take care of his affairs, and defend him
against his brother Euergetes, whom the Alexandrians had set up for
king; when his design was no other than to seize the kingdom of Egypt
for himself: on the other hand, Ptolemy seemed greatly satisfied with
his uncle's protection, and to place great confidence in him; when his
view was to disappoint his scheme, and come to an agreement with his
brother; neither of them meant what they said:

but it shall not prosper; the consultations they held, the schemes they
laid, succeeded not; the peace made between them did not last:

for yet the end shall be at the time appointed; by the Lord, by whom all
events are predetermined; whose counsel shall stand, notwithstanding all
the devices in the hearts of men, and of kings themselves: the end of
this peace between these two kings, and the end of the wars between
them, yea, the end of the two kingdoms, when they should cease, and come
into other hands; all was fixed to a time appointed of God, and should
surely come to pass, as he had decreed.

[Daniel 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">dan 11:28</span></span>

Then shall he return into his land with great riches,.... That is,
Antiochus, with the spoils of Egypt, and the gifts and presents he had
received there; so the author of the first book of Maccabees says,

"20 And after that Antiochus had smitten Egypt, he returned again in the
hundred forty and third year, and went up against Israel and Jerusalem
with a great multitude, 21 And entered proudly into the sanctuary, and
took away the golden altar, and the candlestick of light, and all the
vessels thereof,'' (1 Maccabees 1)

that is, of the era of the Selucidae, and the fifth or sixth year of his
reign:

and his heart shall be against the holy covenant; not the covenant he
had made with Ptolemy, which was a fraudulent one; but the covenant
between God and the Jews; whereby they became a distinct and peculiar
people, having a religion, laws, and ordinances, different from all
others; for which reason they were hated by other nations, and
particularly by Antiochus; and his heart was the more enraged against
them at this time, for the following reason; a false rumour being spread
in Judea that Antiochus was dead, Jason took the opportunity to recover
the office of high priest from his brother Menelaus; and, with a
thousand men, took the city of Jerusalem, drove his brother into the
castle, and slew many he took for his enemies. Antiochus, hearing of
this, concluded the whole nation of the Jews had revolted from him; and
therefore took Judea in his way from Egypt, in order to suppress this
rebellion; in the Apocrypha:

"5 Now when there was gone forth a false rumour, as though Antiochus had
been dead, Jason took at the least a thousand men, and suddenly made an
assault upon the city; and they that were upon the walls being put back,
and the city at length taken, Menelaus fled into the castle: 6 But Jason
slew his own citizens without mercy, not considering that to get the day
of them of his own nation would be a most unhappy day for him; but
thinking they had been his enemies, and not his countrymen, whom he
conquered. 11 Now when this that was done came to the king's ear, he
thought that Judea had revolted: whereupon removing out of Egypt in a
furious mind, he took the city by force of arms,'' (2 Maccabees 5)

and he shall do exploits; in Jerusalem, very wicked ones indeed! he
ordered his soldiers to slay all they met, without mercy, old and young,
women and children, virgins and young men; and in three days' time
eighty thousand were slain, forty thousand bound, and no less sold: he
went into the temple, and took all the vessels in it, and all the gold
and silver, and hidden treasures of it, to the value of a thousand and
eight hundred talents, in the Apocrypha:

"12 And commanded his men of war not to spare such as they met, and to
slay such as went up upon the houses. 13 Thus there was killing of young
and old, making away of men, women, and children, slaying of virgins and
infants. 14 And there were destroyed within the space of three whole
days fourscore thousand, whereof forty thousand were slain in the
conflict; and no fewer sold than slain. 15 Yet was he not content with
this, but presumed to go into the most holy temple of all the world;
Menelaus, that traitor to the laws, and to his own country, being his
guide: 16 And taking the holy vessels with polluted hands, and with
profane hands pulling down the things that were dedicated by other kings
to the augmentation and glory and honour of the place, he gave them
away. 21 So when Antiochus had carried out of the temple a thousand and
eight hundred talents, he departed in all haste unto Antiochia, weening
in his pride to make the land navigable, and the sea passable by foot:
such was the haughtiness of his mind.'' (2 Maccabees 5)

"23 He took also the silver and the gold, and the precious vessels: also
he took the hidden treasures which he found. 24 And when he had taken
all away, he went into his own land, having made a great massacre, and
spoken very proudly. 25 Therefore there was a great mourning in Israel,
in every place where they were;'' (1 Maccabees 1)

and return to his own land; having done these exploits, he made what
haste he could to Antioch, with the spoils of Egypt, and the plunder of
the temple at Jerusalem, in the Apocrypha:

"And when he had taken all away, he went into his own land, having made
a great massacre, and spoken very proudly.'' (1 Maccabees 1:24)

"So when Antiochus had carried out of the temple a thousand and eight
hundred talents, he departed in all haste unto Antiochia, weening in his
pride to make the land navigable, and the sea passable by foot: such was
the haughtiness of his mind.'' (2 Maccabees 5:21)

At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south,.... At
the time appointed of God, he should return from Syria again to Egypt;
which was his third expedition thither, and was occasioned by the
Alexandrians setting up the brother of Ptolemy Philometor for king;
wherefore he hastened to Egypt with a large army, under a pretence of
restoring the deposed king; but in reality to seize the kingdom for
himself (y):

but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter; this expedition
should not succeed so well as the two former, as it did not; he could
not carry his point, neither subdue Egypt, nor get any of the two
brothers into his hands, as he had done before; the reason of which
follows:

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">dan 11:30</span></span>

For the ships of Chittim shall come against him,.... Ptolemy king of
Egypt, and his brother, being come to an agreement, sent an embassy to
the senate of Rome, to implore their help and assistance against
Antiochus, who was preparing to besiege them in Alexandria; upon which
they sent their ambassadors Caius Popilius Laenas, Caius Decimus, and
Caius Hostilius, in ships from Macedonia (z), or Greece, to Antiochus,
to require him to desist from making war upon Ptolemy, and that he quit
the land of Egypt; see [Num 24:24](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#024.md).
Macedonia is called the land of Cittim, in the Apocrypha:

"And it happened, after that Alexander son of Philip, the Macedonian,
who came out of the land of Chettiim, had smitten Darius king of the
Persians and Medes, that he reigned in his stead, the first over
Greece,'' (1 Maccabees 1:1)

"Beside this, how they had discomfited in battle Philip, and Perseus,
king of the Citims, with others that lifted up themselves against them,
and had overcome them:'' (1 Maccabees 8:5)

Jarchi, Aben Ezra, Saadiah, and Jacchiades, interpret it of the Romans;
and, according to Gorionides (a), Cittim are the Romans; and Jerom here
interprets them of them; and Bochart has proved at large (b) that they
are meant. The word seems to be used both of Grecians and Romans, and
here of Romans in Grecian ships:

therefore he shall be grieved, and return; being obliged to it, sore
against his will: as soon as he saw Popilius, with whom he had
contracted a friendship while he was an hostage at Rome, he offered his
hand to kiss; but Popilius refused it, and observed that private
friendship should give way to public interest; and then produced the
decree of the senate, and delivered it to him, and required his answer;
but Antiochus delaying, telling him he would consult his friends,
Popilius, with a rod in his hand, drew a circle round him, and bid him
consult his friends directly; adding that he should not stir from that
circle till he had given a positive answer; which roughness struck him,
and, hesitating a little, he replied he would obey the senate, as Justin
(c), Livy (d), Velleius Paterculus (e), and other historians, relate;
and upon which he at once departed with his army, though fretted and
vexed to the last degree:

and have indignation against the holy covenant; the Jews, God's covenant
people; on whom he gratified his revenge, sending Apollonius, with an
army of twenty two thousand men, to whom he gave orders to slay the men,
and sell the women and children; and who committed many outrages in the
city and temple: now it was the daily sacrifice was made to cease, and
the abomination of desolation set up, as in the following verse, and all
that done predicted in [Dan 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#010.md), this
was two years after his former expedition into Egypt, and the havoc he
made upon his return from thence, and in the eighth year of his reign,
and one hundred and forty fifth of the Seleucidae; in the Apocrypha:

"And spake peaceable words unto them, but all was deceit: for when they
had given him credence, he fell suddenly upon the city, and smote it
very sore, and destroyed much people of Israel.'' (1 Maccabees 1:30)

"He sent also that detestable ringleader Apollonius with an army of two
and twenty thousand, commanding him to slay all those that were in their
best age, and to sell the women and the younger sort:'' (2 Maccabees
5:24)

so shall he do; such wicked deeds as before declared, in his wrath and
fury against the Jews, being provoked at his disappointment in Egypt:

he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the
holy covenant: apostate Jews, who had renounced their religion, forsook
the law of God, and the ordinances of his worship, and turned Heathens;
of whom it is said, agreeably to the language of this prophecy, and
seemingly with a view to it,

that they made themselves uncircumcised, and departed from the holy
covenant, in the Apocrypha:

"And made themselves uncircumcised, and forsook the holy covenant, and
joined themselves to the heathen, and were sold to do mischief.'' (1
Maccabees 1:15)

with these Antiochus kept an intelligence, and held a correspondence, in
order not only to know the affairs of the Jews from time to time, but to
draw them off from their religion, and propagate Heathenism among them;
such as Jason, Menelaus, and others; in the Apocrypha:

"12 So this device pleased them well. 13 Then certain of the people were
so forward herein, that they went to the king, who gave them licence to
do after the ordinances of the heathen: 14 Whereupon they built a place
of exercise at Jerusalem according to the customs of the heathen: 15 And
made themselves uncircumcised, and forsook the holy covenant, and joined
themselves to the heathen, and were sold to do mischief. 43 Yea, many
also of the Israelites consented to his religion, and sacrificed unto
idols, and profaned the sabbath. 44 For the king had sent letters by
messengers unto Jerusalem and the cities of Juda that they should follow
the strange laws of the land, 45 And forbid burnt offerings, and
sacrifice, and drink offerings, in the temple; and that they should
profane the sabbaths and festival days:'' (1 Maccabees 1)

And arms shall stand on his part,.... Powerful armies sent by him into
Judea; garrisons of soldiers placed in Jerusalem; mighty generals and
commanders who fought for him, as Lysias, Philip the Phrygian,
Andronicus, Apollonius, Bacchides, and others:

and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength; the temple, which
stood in Jerusalem, a fortified city, and was itself a building strong
and stable; and especially it was so called, because here the mighty God
had his residence, the symbol of which was the ark of his strength, and
here he gave strength unto his people: this holy place, sacred to his
worship and service, the commanders and soldiers of Antiochus defiled by
entering into it, who were men unholy and unclean; by making it a place
of luxury and rioting, of whoredom, and all manner of uncleanness; by
bringing things into it which were not lawful, and filling the altar
with what was abominable, in the Apocrypha:

"4 For the temple was filled with riot and revelling by the Gentiles,
who dallied with harlots, and had to do with women within the circuit of
the holy places, and besides that brought in things that were not
lawful. 5 The altar also was filled with profane things, which the law
forbiddeth.'' (2 Maccabees 6)

particularly by erecting a high place upon the altar, and sacrificing
swine upon it, as Josephus (f) relates; with which agrees what is said
of Antiochus, in the Apocrypha in is written that he ordered:

"46 And pollute the sanctuary and holy people: 47 Set up altars, and
groves, and chapels of idols, and sacrifice swine's flesh, and unclean
beasts:'' (1 Maccabees 1)

and shall take away the daily sacrifice; the sacrifice of the lamb in
the morning, and in the evening, which the priests were hindered from
offering, by the crowds of Heathens in the temple; or prohibited by the
order of Antiochus; for he forbad burnt offerings, sacrifice, and
libation, to be made in the temple, in the Apocrypha:

"Set up altars, and groves, and chapels of idols, and sacrifice swine's
flesh, and unclean beasts:'' (1 Maccabees 1:47)

and Josephus (g) expressly says, that he forbad the daily sacrifices to
be offered, which were used to be offered to God, according to the law:
and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate; either a
garrison of Heathen soldiers in the temple, which drove the priests and
people from it, and made it desolate; or rather an idol in it, it being
usual in Scripture to call idols abominations, as they are to God and
all good men; the image of Jupiter Olympius, as is thought, which was
placed upon the altar of God by Antiochus, on the fifteenth day of the
month Cisieu, in the hundred and forty fifth year of the Seleucidae, and
is called the abomination of desolations, in the Apocrypha:

"And whosoever was found with any the book of the testament, or if any
committed to the law, the king's commandment was, that they should put
him to death.'' (1 Maccabees 1:57)

and the temple itself was ordered to be called the temple of Jupiter
Olympius, in the Apocrypha:

"And to pollute also the temple in Jerusalem, and to call it the temple
of Jupiter Olympius; and that in Garizim, of Jupiter the Defender of
strangers, as they did desire that dwelt in the place.'' (2 Maccabees
6:2)

and what with this and other things that were done, the temple and city
were left desolate; for it is said in the Apocrypha:

"Now Jerusalem lay void as a wilderness, there was none of her children
that went in or out: the sanctuary also was trodden down, and aliens
kept the strong hold; the heathen had their habitation in that place;
and joy was taken from Jacob, and the pipe with the harp ceased.'' (1
Maccabees 3:45)

It may be rendered, "the abomination that maketh astonished" (h); for it
struck the people of the Jews with astonishment; it amazed and stupefied
them, when they saw such an idol placed in their temple. The Karaite
Jews, who by the others are called Sadducees, give a very foreign
interpretation of this passage, which Aben Ezra observes:

"it is marvellous (says he) that the wise men of the Sadducees should
explain this of future time, and say that this sanctuary is Mecca, where
the Ishmaelites or Turks keep a feast; "the daily sacrifice", to be
removed, their five prayers; and the "abomination" set up is their
idolatrous worship.''

Sir Isaac Newton understands all this of the Romans, and their building
a temple to Jupiter Capitolinus, where the temple in Jerusalem had
stood.

And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall be corrupted by
flatteries,.... That forsook the law of God, the book of the covenant,
and did things contrary to it; and particularly violated the covenant of
circumcision, drawing on the foreskin, and becoming uncircumcised; as
well as rejected other ordinances of religious worship the Jews by
covenant were obliged to observe: these apostates Antiochus corrupted by
good words and fair speeches, by gifts and presents; and they became his
tools, to do his pleasure, and were his instruments to seduce the Jews
to renounce their religion, and give in to his idolatry; such as Jason,
Menelaus, and others; in the Apocrypha:

"Now when the kingdom was established before Antiochus, he thought to
reign over Egypt that he might have the dominion of two realms.'' (1
Maccabees 1:16)

"Now such was the height of Greek fashions, and increase of heathenish
manners, through the exceeding profaneness of Jason, that ungodly
wretch, and no high priest;'' (2 Maccabees 4:13)

"Yet was he not content with this, but presumed to go into the most holy
temple of all the world; Menelaus, that traitor to the laws, and to his
own country, being his guide:'' (2 Maccabees 5:15)

"But they that had the charge of that wicked feast, for the old
acquaintance they had with the man, taking him aside, besought him to
bring flesh of his own provision, such as was lawful for him to use, and
make as if he did eat of the flesh taken from the sacrifice commanded by
the king;'' (2 Maccabees 6:21)

but the people that do know their God shall be strong and do exploits;
such who knew the Lord God of Israel to be the true God, and owned and
acknowledged him as such; and not only professed him, but served and
worshipped him, having a spiritual knowledge of him, and communion with
him; and therefore could not be drawn off from him and his worship by
flatteries or frowns, by promises or menaces: these were strong in the
Lord, and in the power of his might; they held fast their religion, and
the profession of it, and were proof against all allurements or
threatenings, and endured racks and tortures, all sorts of punishment,
and death in every shape, with the greatest constancy and courage; such
as Eleazar, the mother and her seven sons, and others; as well as others
did many valiant actions in the defence of themselves and country, as
Mattathias, Judas Maccabaeus, and his brethren; to which heroic actions
the apostle refers in [Heb 11:34](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#034.md), so
Josephus (i) says,

"that many of the Jews indeed, some willingly, and others through fear
of punishment, obeyed the king's commands; but the more approved, and
those of generous minds, had a greater regard to the customs of their
country than to the punishment threatened to the disobedient; and for
this being continually harassed, and enduring grievous punishments,
died; some were scourged, and their bodies mutilated, and being yet
alive and breathing, were crucified; women and their children, whom they
crucified, were by the king's orders strangled, and hanged about the
necks of their parents that were crucified;''

In the Apocrypha:

"60 At which time according to the commandment they put to death certain
women, that had caused their children to be circumcised. 61 And they
hanged the infants about their necks, and rifled their houses, and slew
them that had circumcised them. 62 Howbeit many in Israel were fully
resolved and confirmed in themselves not to eat any unclean thing. 63
Wherefore the rather to die, that they might not be defiled with meats,
and that they might not profane the holy covenant: so then they died. 64
And there was very great wrath upon Israel.'' (1 Maccabees 1)

And they that understand among the people shall instruct many,.... Such
as had a better understanding of divine things than others, had more
light and knowledge in the sacred Scriptures, in the law of God, and in
his mind and will, and were capable of teaching others; and such as
these the Lord raises up among his people in the worst of times, in the
times of the greatest apostasy and declension; and these are enabled to
perform their duty, to instruct the people in theirs, teach them what
they should do, and how they should behave; exhort them to retain the
doctrines and ordinances of their holy religion, and not embrace the
doctrines and inventions of men, will worship, superstition, and
idolatry; and so they instructed the ignorant, strengthened the weak,
and established the wavering; such were Mattathias the priest of Modin,
and Eleazar, one of the chief scribes, in the Apocrypha:

"In those days arose Mattathias the son of John, the son of Simeon, a
priest of the sons of Joarib, from Jerusalem, and dwelt in Modin.'' (1
Maccabees 2:1)

"Eleazar, one of the principal scribes, an aged man, and of a well
favoured countenance, was constrained to open his mouth, and to eat
swine's flesh.'' (2 Maccabees 6:18)

Auk applies this to the times of the apostles, who he thinks are here
meant; so Sir Isaac Newton:

yet they shall fall by the sword; by the sword of Antiochus and his
soldiers; as multitudes of the Jews did, even both the instructors and
the instructed, who would not comply with his orders:

and by flame; some were burnt alive in caves, where they fled for
shelter; and others as the mother and her seven sons, were cast into
heated caldrons of brass; in the Apocrypha:

"And others, that had run together into caves near by, to keep the
sabbath day secretly, being discovered by Philip, were all burnt
together, because they made a conscience to help themselves for the
honour of the most sacred day.'' (2 Maccabees 6:11)

"3 Then the king, being in a rage, commanded pans and caldrons to be
made hot: 4 Which forthwith being heated, he commanded to cut out the
tongue of him that spake first, and to cut off the utmost parts of his
body, the rest of his brethren and his mother looking on. 5 Now when he
was thus maimed in all his members, he commanded him being yet alive to
be brought to the fire, and to be fried in the pan: and as the vapour of
the pan was for a good space dispersed, they exhorted one another with
the mother to die manfully, saying thus,'' (2 Maccabees 7)

by captivity; so it is expressly said of Antiochus, that he carried
captive women and children and at another time ordered the women and
children to be sold for slaves, in the Apocrypha:

"Insomuch that the inhabitants of Jerusalem fled because of them:
whereupon the city was made an habitation of strangers, and became
strange to those that were born in her; and her own children left her.''
(1 Maccabees 1:38)

"He sent also that detestable ringleader Apollonius with an army of two
and twenty thousand, commanding him to slay all those that were in their
best age, and to sell the women and the younger sort:'' (2 Maccabees
5:24)

and by spoil many days; being plundered of their substance, their houses
rifled, and their goods carried away; and this distress lasted "days", a
short time only; Josephus (k) reckons it at three years and a half. All
this Cocceius interprets of the persecutions of the Christians by the
Romans; and likewise Sir Isaac Newton.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">dan 11:34</span></span>

Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help,....
When the Jews shall be thus harassed and distressed by Antiochus and his
armies, to the ruin of many, by the several sorts of punishments
inflicted on them; they should be helped and eased a little by
Mattathias, a priest of Modin, and his five sons, commonly called the
Maccabees; Porphyry himself interprets this of Mattathias: the help and
assistance which he and his sons gave to the Jews was but "little"; if
we consider they were persons of a small figure, began with a handful of
men, and could do but little, especially at first; and though great
exploits were done by them, considering their number and strength, yet
they were not able to restore the land to its former glory and liberty;
nor did this help of theirs last long, but the enemy returned with great
fierceness and cruelty, and sadly afflicted the people of the Jews.
Cocceius understands this of the help the Christians had under
Constantius Chlorus, and Constantine the great; and so does Sir Isaac
Newton, who agrees with him in interpreting this and the preceding
verse: he interprets "arms", in [Dan
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031.md), of the Romans, and so
Jacchiades; and makes this to be the beginning of the fourth kingdom
that should "stand", "after him"; that is, after Antiochus; so the
particle, he observes, is used in [Dan
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#008.md), and it must be owned this is the
sense in which it is sometimes used, of which Noldius (l) has given
instances: and this seems to agree with the thread of history, and
introduces the Romans, who must have a place in this prophecy, in a very
proper manner; and carries on the account of things, through the times
of Christ, his apostles, the first ages of Christianity under
persecution, until the rise of antichrist, [Dan
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036.md) and throws light upon the text
in [Mat 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015.md), the language of which
seems best to agree with [Dan 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031.md),
and, if so, must respect something to be done, not in the times of
Antiochus, but after the times of Christ.

But many shall cleave to them with flatteries; seeing Mattathias and his
sons succeed, some of those, who had been apostates from their religion,
or not heartily friends to it, joined them, but not sincerely; pretended
to be on their side, and commended their bravery and courage; and being
ambitious of honour and fame, took with them, in order to share the
glory of their actions; such were Joseph the son of Zachariah, and
Azarias, in the Apocrypha:

"56 Joseph the son of Zacharias, and Azarias, captains of the garrisons,
heard of the valiant acts and warlike deeds which they had done. 57
Wherefore they said, Let us also get us a name, and go fight against the
heathen that are round about us.'' (1 Maccabees 5)

and those under whose clothes were found idols, or what belonged to
them, at Jamnia, when they were slain, in the Apocrypha:

"Now under the coats of everyone that was slain they found things
consecrated to the idols of the Jamnites, which is forbidden the Jews by
the law. Then every man saw that this was the cause wherefore they were
slain.'' (2 Maccabees 12:40)

and Rhodocus, a soldier of the Jewish army, who betrayed their secrets,
in the Apocrypha:

"But Rhodocus, who was in the Jews' host, disclosed the secrets to the
enemies; therefore he was sought out, and when they had gotten him, they
put him in prison.'' (2 Maccabees 13:21)

Cocceius applies this to antichrist and his followers pretending to be
for Christ and his church, but were not.

And some of them of understanding shall fall,.... Not into sin, or from
the religion they profess; and the doctrines they have an understanding
of, and have instructed others in; but into distresses and calamities
for their steadfast adherence to the word, worship, and ordinances of
God:

to try them, and purge and make them white; to try their faith,
patience, and other graces, and whether they would hold fast their
profession, and persevere in the good ways of God; and to purge and
separate them from others, that were like chaff, hypocrites, that so
they might be manifest, both the one and the other; and these good men
appear to be sincere and upright: moreover, the best of men have their
dross, and chaff, and spots, to be removed from them; and this is one
way of doing it, even by afflictions: the allusion, in the first word,
is to the melting, purifying, and refining of metals, gold and silver;
the second to the winnowing of a grain floor, and separating the chaff
from the wheat; and the third to the cleansing and whitening of cloths,
and taking the spots out of them by the fuller. Afflictions are the
furnace in which the Lord refines and purifies his people; the fan with
which he purges his floor; and the fuller's soap with which he makes his
people white; by all this the iniquity of Jacob is purged, and the fruit
of it is to take away sin, [Isa 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#009.md),
so that afflictions are not hurtful, but beneficial to the saints, even
those more violent ones, severe persecutions.

Even to the time of the end; because it is yet for a time appointed;
these distresses, calamities, and persecutions, would have an end, and
the time for it was appointed of God; as yet it was not come, but
quickly would, and then an end would be put to the third or Grecian
monarchy; a hint of the Roman power over that being given, [Dan
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#030.md), hence we have no further
account of Antiochus or his sons. Very remarkable are the words of
Aemilius Sara (m),

"the Assyrians first were possessors of monarchy; then the Medes;
afterwards the Persians; then the Macedonians; from that time the kings,
Philip and Antiochus, who sprung from the Macedonians, being conquered,
not long after Carthage was subdued, the supreme power of empire came to
the Roman people;''

of whom, under one character or another, the following part of the
prophecy is chiefly to be understood. So another historian says (n),
Antiochus being drove out of Asia, the Romans first set footing there;
and another (o) observes, that Antiochus being defeated by L. Cornelius
Scipio, he took the name of Asiaticus, because he had conquered Asia; as
his brother was called Africanus, from his subduing Africa: wherefore
Asia and Africa being now in the hands of the Romans, the supreme power
might well be said to be with them; and therefore, henceforward, are
only spoken of, and particularly the Roman antichrist.

And the king shall do according to his will,.... Not Antiochus, for he
could not do as he would, being curbed by the Romans, as has been
observed; and there are many things which follow that cannot be applied
to him; rather the Roman people, under the name of a king or kingdom,
rising up to universal monarchy, upon the decline of the Grecian empire,
are meant; and who did what they would, subdued kingdoms at pleasure,
and gave laws to the whole world; and particularly in the little horn,
or Rome Papal, antichrist, [Dan 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008.md),
of which Antiochus was a type, and is called by the same name, [Dan
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#009.md) and the transition is easy from
the type to the antitype, with whom everything said agrees: for the pope
of Rome, claiming infallibility, does, or has done, whatsoever he
pleases; regarding neither the laws of God nor man, but dispensing with
both at his pleasure; coining new doctrines; appointing new ordinances;
setting himself up above councils and princes; taking upon him a power
to depose kings and set them up as he pleases; with many other things
done by him in an arbitrary and despotic way, both civil and religious;
and with none does the character agree as with him, as well as what
follows:

and magnify himself above every god; that is so called, whether angels
whom he commands, or the kings of the earth he claims an authority over,
those gods in heaven, and gods on earth; which is the exact description
of antichrist, as given by the apostle, who has manifestly a reference
to this passage; see Gill on [Th2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004.md),

and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods; the true God,
to whom angels and civil magistrates are subject, being his creatures,
and acting under him; but such is the arrogance of the man of sin, that
he takes upon him to speak against God, and such things as are
astonishing; and it may be extremely wondered at that he should dare to
speak them, as to call himself God on earth; to take such things to
himself, which only belong to God, as by claiming all power in heaven,
earth, and hell; power to bind the consciences of men, and impose what
he pleases on them; to make new articles of faith; to pardon the sins of
men; to open and shut the gates of heaven when he pleases; with other
blasphemies against God, his mouth, given him to speak, utters; see [Rev
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#005.md),

and shall prosper until the indignation be accomplished; the wrath of
God upon the Jewish nation for their rejection of the Messiah; until the
time of their conversion is come; and then antichrist shall be
destroyed, to make way for it; till that time he shall prosper and
flourish, more or less, until the 1260 days or years are ended, the date
of his reign, [Rev 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#002.md),

for that that is determined shall be done; all the decrees and purposes
of God shall be accomplished; all respecting the state and condition of
the people of God under antichrist, particularly the people of the Jews,
and concerning the reign and ruin of antichrist.

Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers,.... Of the apostles of
Christ, from whom he pretends to descend, and whose successor he would
be thought to be: now their God was the Lord Jesus Christ, whom they
worshipped and adored, believed in, embraced, professed, and preached;
but whom antichrist disregards, though he would be thought to be his
vicar on earth; yet slights him, yea, opposes and acts contrary to him,
in his offices of Prophet, Priest, and King, and therefore is rightly
called antichrist:

nor the desire of women; or "wives" (p); not desirous of having wives,
or enjoying women in lawful marriage; but forbidding his priests to
marry, as is notoriously a tenet of antichrist, and foretold by the
apostle, in agreement to this prophecy, [Ti1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#003.md), otherwise, none more lustful or
desirous of women in an unlawful way than the Romish priests:

nor regard any god; either the true God, and his laws, or any god in a
metaphorical sense, any king or potentate on earth; showing no respect
to any authority, or to any laws, divine or human:

for he shall magnify himself above all; above all gods, real or nominal,
as in [Th2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004.md).

But in his estate shall he honour the god of forces,.... Or god Mahuzzim
(q); departed saints and their images, whom the Papists make their
protectors, defenders, and guardians: the word signifies towers, strong
holds, fortresses; and by these titles the martyrs, saints departed, are
called by the ancient fathers, who first introduced the worship of them:
So Basil (r), speaking of the forty martyrs, says,

"these are they, who obtaining our country, like certain towers, afford
us a refuge against the incursion of enemies:''

and a little after thus addresses them,

"O ye common keepers of mankind, the best companions of our cares, the
suffragans of our prayers and wishes, "most powerful" ambassadors with
God, &c.:''

and elsewhere (s) he prays,

"that God would keep the church unmoved, and fortified with the great
towers of the martyrs;''

so Chrysostom (t) calls them patrons and protectors. Or, "with God he
shall honour" (u); these along with him, or besides him; these shall be
the objects of religious worship and honour, as they are: and that "in
his estate"; or in his room and stead, that is, of the true God, our
Lord Jesus Christ, the only Mediator between God and man; and yet angels
and departed saints are set up as mediators in his stead:

and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour; the host, the
wafer, the breaden god, made a god by the words of a muttering priest;
this is such a god as the apostles, and Peter particularly, from whom
the popes of Rome pretend to, derive their succession, never knew, nor
once dreamed of; and yet this is received as a god, bowed unto, and
worshipped, and honoured:

with gold, silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things; with
rich and costly ornaments, with which the pyxis or box, in which it is
carried in procession, is adorned.

"in the strong holds of Mahuzzim" (w) that is, in the temples, churches,
and chapels, dedicated to angels and departed saints; deck and adorn
their images with gold, silver, precious stones, and with desirable
things, which is notorious; as well as commit the grossest idolatries
with this strange breaden god; which they hold up in such places, cringe
and bow to, and pay all religious worship and adoration to it:

whom he shall acknowledge, and increase with glory; as really God; the
wafer being transubstantiated into the very body and blood of Christ, as
is said; and own it as such, as very God, and heap religious honour and
glory upon it, which is due to Christ:

he shall cause them to rule over many; that is, the Mahuzzim, the
departed saints; one shall rule over England, and be the patron and
defender of it, as St. George; another over Scotland, as St. Andrew;
another over Ireland, as St. Patrick; another over France, as St.
Dennis; another over Spain, as St. James:

and shall divide the land for gain; or "price" (x); the whole Romish
jurisdiction, all antichristian states, which are divided among those
tutelar saints; each of them have their proper country assigned them
they are to defend; but this is not done without gain arising to the
pope of Rome from those countries, as by firstfruits, annates, Peter's
pence, &c.

And at the time of the end,.... At the end of the time appointed of God,
when antichrist is arrived to the height of his power and authority:

shall the king of the south push at him; not Philometor king of Egypt;
nor is Antiochus meant in the next clause by the king of the north; for,
after he was required by the Romans to quit the land of Egypt, there was
no more war between him and the king of Egypt; rather therefore the
Saracens are meant by the king of the south, as Mr. Mede (y) and
Cocceius think, who came from the south, from Arabia Felix: and so
Gravius interprets it of the king or caliph of the Saracens, and his
successors; who, extending their empire through Asia and Africa,
repressed the attempts of the Roman antichrist affecting primacy in the
east; and this way goes Mr. Mede, who takes them to be the same with the
locusts in [Rev 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#003.md), that distressed
antichrist:

and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind; not
Antiochus, as before observed; but either emperors, kings, and Christian
princes, the chief of which was Godfrey of Bullain, who was crowned king
of Jerusalem, as Cocceius: or the Turks, as Jacchiades, so Mr. Brightman
on the place, and Mr. Mede; who were originally Tartars or Scythians,
and came from the north, the same with the horsemen at Euphrates, [Rev
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#015.md), who also came against
antichrist; for he seems to be the "him" they both came against; both
the king of the south, and the king of the north, the two woes that came
upon Christendom the Saracens are the first woe, and the Turks the
second; and who chiefly afflicted the antichristian states, and came
like a whirlwind upon them, suddenly, swiftly, and with great rapidity
and force:

with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; which well agrees
with the Turks, whose armies chiefly consist of horse:

and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow, and pass
over; into the countries belonging to antichrist; particularly the Greek
or eastern empire; which they overran like a flood, seized it for
themselves, and set up an empire for themselves, which still continues;
as well as entered into some parts of Europe, and did much damage.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">dan 11:41</span></span>

He shall enter also into the glorious land,.... The land of Israel, as
the Syriac version expresses it; or the land of Judea, which the Turk
entered into, and got possession of, and still retains, notwithstanding
all the attempts made by the European princes to get it out of his hand:

and many countries shall be overthrown; of which the eastern empire
listed as Bithynia, Mysia, Lycaonia, Phrygia, and Carlo, and to the
Hellesport and the Euxine sea, conquered by Ottoman and his son
Urchenes; Callipolis, Hadrianople, by Amurath; Thessalia, Macedonia,
Phocis, Mysia, and Bulgaria, by Bajazet; and at last Constantinople
itself by Mahomet the second, which put an end to the eastern empire:
though perhaps those countries and places may be here more especially
meant which lay near Judea, and fell into the hands of the Turk when
that did; as Comagene of Syria, Antioch, Damascus, Tripolis, Berytus,
Sidon, and all Palestine, and all the sea coast to Egypt:

but these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom and Moab, and the
chief of the children of Ammon; by which according to Jerom is meant
Arabia, left untouched by him; so Mr. Mede interprets them of Arabia and
Petraea, which some of the above people formerly inhabited, as
Jacchiades observes; and which Arabians were never subdued by the Turks,
but are independent of them to this day; yea, the Turks pay a yearly
tribute to them for the passage of their pilgrims to Mecca, as well as
pay for the canyons that pass through their country, as is affirmed (z)
by modern travellers; and yet it may be observed that these countries
did not escape Antiochus, who particularly took Rabbath, the metropolis
of Ammon.

He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries,.... Before
mentioned, and take possession of them and rule over them, as the Turk
does to this day:

and the land of Egypt shall not escape; the hands of the Turk by whom it
was taken from the Mamalucs; and is now a province of the Turkish
empire, and governed by a Turkish basha, with twenty four princes under
him (a). This was not true of Antiochus, who, after he had been checked
by the Romans, never entered into Egypt, and much less became master of
it, as the Turk now is.

But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and silver, and over
all the precious things of Egypt,.... The land of Egypt, as it is a very
large, so a very rich country, abounding with gold, silver, and precious
things; all which came into the hands of the Turk along with it; for
when Selim, the ninth emperor of the Turks, conquered the Mamalucs he
caused five hundred of the chiefest Egyptian families to be transported
to Constantinople; as likewise a great number of Mamalucs' wives and
children, besides the sultan's treasure, and other immense riches (b).

And the Lybians and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps; at his command
and pleasure; shall follow him, being taken captive, or go where he
orders them; that is, in all things shall be obedient to him. So we find
that these very people will be in the army of Gog or the Turk, when he
shall march against the land of Judea, to recover it from the Jews, when
possessed of it, [Eze 38:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#005.md). These
people, the Africans and Ethiopians, are near to Egypt, and therefore
mentioned with it, and never were under the power of Antiochus, as
Jerome observes; but are now subject to the Ottoman empire, and make a
part of it; which is a very strong evidence of the Turk being the king
of the north here spoken of.

But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him,....
This and the following verse respect times and things yet to come, and
the interpretation of them is not so certain: perhaps this clause may
have a regard to the news brought to the Turk, of the Jews, upon their
conversion, being about to return to their own land, from the eastern
and northern parts of the world, where they chiefly are at this day;
which will greatly alarm him, since their land is part of his dominions:
or it may be, out of the east may come tidings of some commotions and
disturbances in the eastern part of the world, as Tartary, &c. which he
may fear would be of bad consequence to the Ottoman empire; and news out
of the north, of the northern Christian princes preparing to assist the
Jews in the repossession of their country; all which may give him great
uneasiness.

Therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to
make away many; hearing the Jews are preparing to return to their own
country, or that they have got possession of it, he will be provoked to
the last degree, and raise a prodigious army, and march out of his own
land with them to Judea;

and will come like a storm, with the utmost rage and fury, and like a
cloud for number, and threaten utter ruin and destruction to the nation
of the Jews; this will be his end in view in coming out, but he will not
be able to accomplish it; of all which see [Eze
38:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#002.md), where the Turk, and this
expedition of his, are prophesied of, and where he goes by the name of
Gog.

[Daniel 11:45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">dan 11:45</span></span>

And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace,.... Or "pavilion" (c);
the tents for his princes and generals that come with him; which shall
be placed about his own, and where he will think himself safe and
secure, and sure of victory. Symmachus renders the words, "the tents of
his cavalry" (d); or the stables of his horses; which agrees well enough
with the Turks, whole cavalry is usually very large, their armies
chiefly consisting of horsemen; such he shall bring into the land of
Judea, and place them as after mentioned, as if he had got the day, and
had obtained a settlement. The word used has the signification of
covering and clothing; hence some translate it, "the tents of his
curtain" (e); tents covered with curtains or veils, such as the tents of
kings, generals, and principal officers, were covered with,
distinguished from others by the splendour and magnificence of them. It
seems to be derived from the same root as the ephod, a curious garment
wore by the high priest among the Jews; hence Saadiah interprets it here
a covering figured and wrought very artificially; and it is by some
rendered "the tents or tabernacles of his tunic or clothing" (f). And it
is an ingenious conjecture of a learned man of our own country (g), that
it may refer to an ancient custom of the Roman emperors, who used before
a battle to have a scarlet coat spread over their tents, or hung up upon
a spear, to give notice of it, as appears from Plutarch, Isidore, and
others; and so this furious enemy of the church of God is here
represented as setting up his bloody flag or ensign, and preparing for
battle, threatening with utter desolation and destruction. And this will
be

between the seas, in the glorious holy mountain; in the mountain or
mountains of the land of Israel, upon which it is certain Gog or the
Turk shall come, and there he shall fall, [Eze
39:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#002.md), particularly the mountains about
Jerusalem, and more especially Mount Zion, or Moriah, as Jacchiades; on
which the temple was built formerly, and was glorious and holy on that
account, and for which reason the epithets may be retained; though it
will now be glorious and holy, through a glorious and holy people, the
Jews, become Christian, residing and worshipping in Jerusalem; whose
situation is between two seas, the Mediterranean sea to the west, and
the sea of Sodom, or the Syrian or Persian sea, to the east, called the
hinder and the former seas in [Zac
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#008.md). Some take the word "Apadno",
translated "palace", for the proper name of a place, Theodoret takes it
to be a place near Jerusalem; and Jerom says it was near Nicopolis,
which was formerly called Emmaus; where the mountainous parts of Judea
begin to rise, and lay between the Dead sea on the east, and the great
sea on the west, where he supposes antichrist will pitch his tent: and
Porphyry, as he relates, who interprets the whole of Antiochus, places
it between the two rivers Tigris and Euphrates; he says that Antiochus
went on an expedition against Artaxis, king of Armenia, and, having
slain many of his army, pitched his tent in the place Apadno, which is
situated between two large rivers, Tigris and Euphrates; and that he
afterwards went to the top of a mountain, in the province of Elymais,
the further part of Persia to the east, with a design to rob the temple
of Diana; but being discovered by the people was obliged to flee, and
that he died with grief in Tabes, a town in Persia: and Father Calmet is
of opinion that a place between those two rivers before mentioned is
meant, and translates the words thus,

"he shall pitch his tents in Apadno of the two seas;''

or in Padan of two rivers, Mesopotamia, situated between the Euphrates
and the Tigris, two large rivers, and justly compared with the sea,
particularly for their inundations. Dr. Goodwin (h) expresses his fears
that our British isles are here invaded, which so eminently stand
between the seas, and which God has made the eminent seat of the church
in these latter days; and his fears would seem to be too well grounded,
were the Romish or western antichrist here designed; but the Turk, or
the eastern antichrist, is manifestly spoken of, as appears by the
context: and the reason why he is so much observed, and so many things
said of him, is, because the Jews have, and will have, the greatest
concern with him, their country being in his hands; and it is for their
sakes chiefly that the whole of this prophecy is delivered out; however,
both antichrists, the one and the other, shall come to utter
destruction, as follows: "yet he shall come to his end, and none shall
help him"; he shall fall upon the mountains of Israel, he and his
princes, his generals, and captains, and mighty men; the whole Ottoman
empire shall be destroyed, signified by the drying up of the river
Euphrates, which is in his dominions, [Rev
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#012.md), and of the vast multitudes that
shall come with him, Persia, Ethiopia, Lybia, Gomer, and Togarmah, [Eze
38:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#005.md) and the numerous provinces he is
master of; none shall be able to help him, or save him from ruin: of the
destruction of the Turk, under the name of Gog, see [Eze
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#001.md).
