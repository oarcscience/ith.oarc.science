INTRODUCTION TO HABAKKUK

This book is called, in the Vulgate Latin and Syriac versions, "the
Prophecy of Habakkuk". Of this prophet, Aben Ezra and Kimchi say, we
know neither his age nor his family; which shows they paid no regard to
a tradition of their nation, mentioned by some of their ancient writers
(a), that he was the son of the Shunammite, whom Elisha raised from the
dead; and find the etymology of his name in the words of the prophet to
her, "about this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt
embrace a son", [Kg2 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#016.md) where the
root of his name is used; and they account for the doubling of the last
radical in his name, because of the two embraces of him, one by his
mother, and the other by the prophet. His name indeed signifies "an
embrace" (b); or, as some, "an embracer" (c); and the last letter being
doubled, it is with others interpreted "the best embracer" (d); to which
name his character and conduct agree; who, in the most tender manner,
embraced the people of God, as parents their children, and comforted
them with the assurance of their preservation, notwithstanding their
captivity, and with the promise of the Messiah's coming; suggesting to
them they should live by faith, to which he led them the way by his own
example, [Hab 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#012.md), [Hab
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003.md) but as this is placing him too
early, to put him in the times of Elisha; so it is fixing him too late,
to make him to be in the times of Daniel, and to feed him in the den of
the lions, as Joseph ben Gorion (e), and the author of the apocryphal
book of Bel and the Dragon, say he did, which was after the Babylonish
captivity was ended; whereas it is certain this prophet prophesied of
it, and must have lived some time before it; for he speaks of the
Chaldeans by name coming against the Jews, and carrying them captive,
[Hab 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#006). The learned Huetius (f.md), and
others, think there were two prophets of this name; one of the tribe of
Simeon, who lived before the captivity; and another of the tribe of
Levi, who lived after it. The Jewish chronologers (g) generally place
this our prophet in the times of Manasseh; with which well enough agrees
the description of the times the prophet lived in, given in [Hab
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#002.md) though some think he lived in the
latter times of Josiah (h), or the beginning of Jehoiakim (i); and it is
probable he was a contemporary of the Prophet Jeremiah, with whom he
agrees in many things, and prophesied of the same. However, there is no
room to doubt of the authority of this book, being always received by
the Jewish church, and agreeing with other parts of Scripture, and
especially with the prophecies of Jeremiah; and may be further confirmed
and established by the quotations out of it in the New Testament, as
[Hab 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#005.md) in [Act
13:41](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#041.md) and [Hab
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004.md) in [Rom
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017.md). The general design of the
prophecy is to comfort the people of God under the afflictions that were
coming upon them, and to encourage them to the exercise of faith and
patience, in the hope and view of the coming of the Messiah. Pseudo
Epiphanius (k) says that Habakkuk died two years before the people of
the Jews returned from Babylon, and was honourably buried in his own
native place, which he says was Bethsocher, in the tribe of Simeon. With
whom Isidore (l) agrees, as to the time of his death; but the place of
his birth, he says, was Bethacat; and of his death, Sabarta. Sozomen (m)
reports, that, in the days of Theodosius, the grave of Habakkuk was
found in Cele, formerly the city Ceila. So Eusebius says it was shown at
Kela, eight miles from Eleutheropolis; though, in another place, he says
it was to be seen at Gabbatha, twelve miles from the same place; which
may be reconciled, by observing that it might be between them both, and
be seen from each, since they were places near to each other (n). But
the Cippi Hebraici (o) say it was at a place called Jakuk in Galilee,
not far from Sephetta, where was an academy of the Jews; and this seems
to agree with what Sanderson, a countryman of ours, as quoted by Van
Till (p), observes; that in his journey from Damascus to Jerusalem,
between Sephet and Chapherchittin, he found a village, in which, the
Jews report, Habakkuk the prophet dwelt and died, the name of which is
Jeakoke. But these things are not to be depended on.
