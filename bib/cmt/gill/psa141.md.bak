[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 141:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO PSALM 141

A Psalm of David. This psalm was written about the same time, and upon
the same occasion, as that going before and what follows after; even
when David was persecuted by Saul, and when he was in great danger of
his enemies, and snares were laid for his life.

[Psalms 141:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 141:1</span></span>

Lord, I cry unto thee,.... With great earnestness, importunity, and
fervency, being in distress; and knowing vain was the help of man, and
that none could deliver him but the Lord, and therefore continued crying
unto him for help (w);

make haste unto me; which shows he was in a desperate condition; that he
could not help himself, nor could any creature, only the Lord; and he
was at a distance from him, as it seemed to him, and he delayed
assistance; and therefore desires he would immediately draw nigh and be
a present help in his time of need, and work speedy deliverance for him,
his case requiring haste;

give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee; a request the psalmist
frequently makes, not contenting himself with prayer, without desiring
and looking for an answer to it.

[Psalms 141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 141:2</span></span>

Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense,.... Which was offered
every morning on the altar of incense, at which time the people were
praying, [Exo 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#001.md); and was an emblem
of it, even of pure, holy, and fervent prayer; which being offered on
the altar Christ, which sanctifies every gift, and by him the High
Priest; through whom every sacrifice is acceptable unto God; and through
whose blood and righteousness, and the sweet incense of his mediation
and intercession, it becomes fragrant and a sweet odour to the Lord; and
being directed to him, it goes upwards, is regarded by him, and
continues before him as sweet incense; which is what the psalmist prays
for; see [Mal 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#011.md);

and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice; the burnt
sacrifice of the evening, according to Ben Melech, the lamb slain every
evening; or else the minchah, as the word is; the meat, or rather the
bread offering made of fine flour, with oil and frankincense on it,
which went along with the former, [Exo
29:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#038.md); and so the Targum,

"as the sweet gift offered in the evening.''

This only is mentioned, as being put for both the morning and the
evening sacrifice; or because the incense was offered in the morning,
from which it is distinguished: or it may be, as Kimchi thinks, this
psalm was composed in the evening; and so the inscription in the Syriac
version is,

"a psalm of David, when he meditated the evening service.''

Or because this was the last sacrifice of the day; there was no other
after it, as Aben Ezra observes; and the most acceptable; to which may
be added, that this was the hour for prayer, [Act
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#001.md). Wherefore "lifting up of the
hands" was a prayer gesture, and a very ancient one both among Jews and
Gentiles (x); Aristotle (y) says, all men, when we pray, lift up our
hands to heaven; and it is put for that itself, [Ti1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#008.md); and is desired to be, like that,
acceptable unto God; as it is when the heart is lifted up with the
hands, and prayer is made in the name and faith of Christ.

[Psalms 141:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 141:3</span></span>

Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth,.... While praying, as Jarchi and
Kimchi; that he might not utter any rash, unguarded, and unbecoming
word; but take and use the words which God gives, even the taught words
of the Holy Ghost; or lest, being under affliction and oppression, he
should speak unadvisedly with his lips, and utter any impatient
murmuring and repining word against God; or express any fretfulness at
the prosperity of the wicked, or speak evil of them; especially of Saul,
the Lord's anointed, for the ill usage of him;

keep the door of my lips; which are as a door that opens and shuts: this
he desires might be kept as with a bridle, especially while the wicked
were before him; lest he should say anything they would use against him,
and to the reproach of religion; and that no corrupt communication, or
any foolish and filthy talk, or idle and unprofitable words, might
proceed from them. The phrase signifies the same as the other; he was
sensible of his own inability to keep a proper watch and guard over his
words, as was necessary, and therefore prays the Lord to do it; see [Psa
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#001.md).

[Psalms 141:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 141:4</span></span>

Incline not my heart to any evil thing,.... Or "evil word" (z), as the
Targum; since out of the abundance of that the mouth speaketh, [Mat
12:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#034.md); or to any sinful thing, to the
commission of any evil action: not that God ever inclines men's hearts
to sin by any physical influence, it being what is repugnant to his
nature and will, and what he hates and abhors; for though he hardens the
hearts of wicked men, and gives them up to the lusts of them; yet he
does not move, incline, or tempt any man to sin, [Jam
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#013.md); but he may be said to do this
when he suffers them to follow their own sinful inclinations, and leaves
them to be inclined by the power and prevalency of their own
corruptions, and by the temptations of Satan, which is here deprecated;
see [Psa 119:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#036.md). So as

to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity; to join with those
that make a trade of sinning; the course of whose life is evil, in their
unfruitful works of darkness; and do as they do, even commit crimes the
most flagitious and enormous: he seems to have respect to great persons,
whose examples are very forcible and ensnaring; and therefore it
requires an exertion of the powerful and efficacious grace of God, to
preserve such from the influence of them, whose business is much with
them;

and let me not eat of their dainties; since their table was a snare to
themselves, it might be so to him; and be a means of betraying him
unawares into the commission of some sins, which would be dishonourable
and grieving to him: the psalmist desires not to partake with them at
their table; but chose rather a meatier table and coarser fare, where he
might be more free from temptation; see [Pro
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#001.md). Or this may be understood of the
dainties and sweet morsels of sin; which are like stolen waters, and
bread eaten in secret, to a carnal heart: though the pleasures of it are
but imaginary, and last but for a season, and therefore are avoided by a
gracious man; by whom even afflictions with the people of God are
preferred unto them, [Heb 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#025.md). The
Targum interprets it of the song of the house of their feasts; which is
ensnaring.

[Psalms 141:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 141:5</span></span>

Let the righteous smite me, it shall be a kindness,.... Or, "smite me in
kindness" (a). In love; in a loving and friendly manner, which makes
reproofs the more agreeable and effectual. Not the righteous God, as
Arama; though he does sometimes smite his people for their sins, [Isa
57:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#017.md); that is, reproves, corrects,
and chastises them, and that in love and for their good; and therefore
such smitings and corrections should be taken in good part by them, and
received as fatherly chastisements, and as instances of his paternal
care of them, and love to them; but rather righteous and good men; who,
when there is occasion for it, should reprove and rebuke one another;
but then it should be in a kind and tender manner, and with the spirit
of meekness; and such reproofs should be as kindly received: "for
faithful are the wounds of a friend, but the kisses of an enemy are
deceitful", [Pro 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#006.md). Or, "let the
righteous beat me with kindness" or "goodness" (b); with precepts of
goodness, by inculcating good things into him; which he should take, as
if he overwhelmed and loaded him with benefits; even though it was like
striking with a hammer, as the word signifies;

and let him, reprove me; which explains what is meant by smiting;

it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head; give no
pain nor uneasiness to his head or his heart, but rather supple and heal
the wounds sin reproved for has made. The Targum is,

"the oil of the anointing of the sanctuary shall not cease from my
head;''

with which he was anointed king; and signifies that he should enjoy the
dignity, and continue in it. The Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic
versions, render it, "the oil of the ungodly", or "sinners": meaning
their flattering words, which, though smooth as oil, were deceitful; and
therefore he deprecates them, "let not the oil of the wicked", &c. as
being hurtful and pernicious;

for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities; that is, when the
righteous, that smote and reproved him for his good, should be in any
distress; such a grateful sense should he retain of their favour in
reproving him, that he would pray for them, that they might be delivered
out of it; which would show that he took it kindly at their hand. Or,
"in their evils", or "against them" (c); which some understand of the
evil practices of wicked men; which the psalmist prayed against, and
that he might be kept and delivered from.

[Psalms 141:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 141:6</span></span>

When their judges are overthrown in stony places,.... The judges of
David's adversaries, the workers of iniquity; meaning Saul, Abner, &c.
Arama refers this to Saul and his sons being slain on the mountains of
Gilboa, [Sa1 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#001.md); which might be here
prophetically spoken of. Or, as it is by some rendered, "when their
judges are let down by the sides of the rock" (d); or let go free, as
Saul was by David more than once; when it was in the power of his hands
to have taken away his life, which his principal friends urged him to
do, [Sa1 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#002.md). Some render the words
as an imprecation or wish, "let their judges be cast down" (e); or as a
prophecy, they "shall be cast dozen in stony places", or "by the sides
of a rock": so the word is used of casting or throwing down, [Kg2
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#033.md); and may allude to the manner of
punishment used in some places, by casting down from a precipice, from
rocks and hills; see [Ch2 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#012.md). Or,
"when they slip by the sides of the rock" (f); endeavouring to get up
it; as ambitious men are desirous of getting to the top of honour,
power, and authority, but stand in slippery places, and often slip and
fall. And when this should be the case of these judges, then should
David be raised up on high; the anointed of the God of Jacob, the sweet
psalmist of Israel. And then

they shall hear my words, for these are sweet: that is, the common
people should hear them, and be pleased with them, who had been set
against him by their judges; by which they would easily perceive that he
had no enmity nor malice, nor ill design against Saul. This may respect
either his very affectionate lamentation at the death of Saul and his
sons, [Sa2 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#017.md); or what he delivered
at the several times he spared the life of Saul, when he could have
taken it away, [Sa1 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#009.md); and it is
especially true of all the words which David spoke by inspiration, or
the Spirit of God spake to him; particularly in his book of Psalms,
concerning the Messiah, the covenant of grace, and the blessings of it;
of the rich experiences of grace he had, and the several doctrines of
the Gospel declared by him; which were sweet, delightful, and
entertaining to those who have ears to hear such things; or whose ears
are opened to hear them, so as to understand them and distinguish them;
but to others not.

[Psalms 141:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 141:7</span></span>

Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth,.... Into which they were
not suffered to be put, but lay unburied; or from whence they were dug
up, and lay scattered about; which is to be understood of such of
David's friends as fell into the hands of Saul and his men, and were
slain: perhaps it may refer to the fourscore and five priests, and the
inhabitants of Nob, slain by the order of Saul, [Sa1
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#018.md). Though the phrase may be only
proverbial, and be expressive of the danger David and his men were in,
and their sense of it, who looked upon themselves like dry bones,
hopeless and helpless, and had the sentence of death in themselves, and
were as it were at the mouth of the grave, on the brink of ruin;

as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth: and the chips fly
here and there, and are disregarded; such was their case: or as men cut
and cleave the earth with the plough, and it is tore up by it, and falls
on each side of it, so are we persecuted, afflicted, and distressed by
our enemies, and have no mercy shown us; so the Targum,

"as a man that cuts and cleaves with ploughshares in the earth, so our
members are scattered at the grave's mouth.''

The Syriac and Arabic versions understand it of the ploughshare cutting
the earth.

[Psalms 141:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 141:8</span></span>

But mine eyes are unto thee, O God the Lord,.... Not only the eyes of
his body, lifted up to God in prayer, this being a prayer gesture, [Joh
11:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#041.md); but the eyes of his mind, or
understanding, especially the eyes of faith and love; for it is
expressive of his affection to God, his holy confidence in him, and
humble hope and expectation of good things from him, in this his time of
distress: his eyes were to him and him only, both for temporal food for
himself and his men; and for spiritual food, for all supplies of grace,
for wisdom and direction, for strength and assistance, for protection
and deliverance;

in thee is my trust; not in himself, nor in his friends, nor in any
creature, prince or potentate, but in the Lord, as the God of nature,
providence, and grace; to which he was encouraged by his lovingkindness
to him; by the everlasting strength in him; by what he had done for
others and for him in times past; by the provisions he has made in his
covenant and promises for those that trust in him, who are of all men
most happy;

leave not my soul destitute; of daily food, of help and assistance, of
the presence, spirit, and grace of God; or "naked" (g), and defenceless,
but let it be surrounded or protected by almighty power and grace; or
"pour not out my soul" (h), that is, unto death; suffer me not to be
taken by enemies and slain; see [Isa
53:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012.md). The Targum is,

"in the Word (of the Lord) I trust, do not empty my soul,''

or "evacuate" (i) it, as Aben Ezra; that is, out of his body; for he
observes, that the soul fills the body.

[Psalms 141:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 141:9</span></span>

Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me,.... Either Saul, who
gave him a wife to be a snare to him, and set men to watch his house and
take him; or the Ziphites, who proposed to Saul to deliver him into his
hands; see [Sa1 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#021.md).

and the gins of the workers of iniquity; the transgressions of wicked
men are snares to others, by way of example; and so are the doctrines of
false teachers, and the temptations of Satan, from all which good men
desire to be kept, [Pro 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#006.md); and it
is the Lord alone that keeps and preserves from them, or breaks the
snare and delivers them, [Psa 124:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#007.md).

[Psalms 141:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 141:10</span></span>

Let the wicked fall into their own nets,.... Which they have laid for
others, as they very often do; see [Psa
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#015); or "into his net" (k.md), either
Saul into his own net, and others with him, so Kimchi and Ben Melech; or
the wicked into the net which God has laid for them; see [Eze
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#013.md);

whilst that I withal escape; or "whilst I together escape", or "pass
over" (l); that is, while he, together with his companions, passed over
the net laid; or,

"till I pass over safe and sound,''

will all mine, as Noldius (m); not only pass over and escape the snares
of the wicked, but pass out of this world into a state of happiness and
glory in another.
