INTRODUCTION TO EZEKIEL 45

This chapter treats of the division of the land in future time, and the
persons and uses for which it is to be made; one part being for the
sanctuary, and the priests that serve in it, and for their houses for
them to dwell in, [Eze 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#001.md), another
for the Levites and their chambers, [Eze
45:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#005.md), and another for the city, for
the Israelites in common, [Eze 45:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#006.md),
and the last for the prince; and of the situation and extent of it, [Eze
45:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#007.md) and of the righteous
administration of civil government in the time of the spiritual reign of
Christ, in abstinence from violence and exactions, and doing justice,
for which orders and directions are given, [Eze
45:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#009.md), then of the oblations of the
people of the land, [Eze 45:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#013.md), and
next of those that are to be prepared by the prince, [Eze
45:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#017.md), and the times of the offering
of them, at the beginning of the year, on the feasts of the passover and
tabernacles, [Eze 45:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#018.md), the rules for
which are so different from the Mosaic law, as show the abrogation of
that; and that all this is to be understood in a spiritual and evangelic
sense.

[Ezekiel 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 45:1</span></span>

Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land, for inheritance,....
This is not to be understood literally of the division of the land of
Israel; which agrees not with the division of it begun by Moses, and
finished by Joshua, upon his conquest of it, and the introduction of the
people of Israel into it; nor was such a division as this made when the
Jews returned from Babylon; nor is there any reason to expect the like
when they shall be converted in the latter day; nor is it meant
typically of the heavenly inheritance, which saints obtain in Christ by
lot, [Eph 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#011.md), of which the earthly
Canaan was a type; though some in this way interpret it: but since the
whole vision respects the church of Christ on earth, it must be meant
mystically and spiritually of the kingdom of Christ, and the settlement
and establishment of it throughout the whole world, according to the
allotment and determination of God; and they are a distinct and special
people that are admitted into this state; it is by the distinguishing
grace of God that they are taken into the Gospel church, and have a part
and share in all the privileges and immunities of it.

Ye shall offer an oblation unto the Lord, an holy portion of the land;
which should be lifted up as the heave offering was, and dedicated to
the Lord: this designs such persons who are separated from the world,
and sanctified by the Spirit of God, who shall be brought by the
ministers of the word to the Lord, as trophies of his efficacious and
victorious grace, ascribing the whole glory of their conversion to him;
and these shall present themselves, souls and bodies, a holy, living,
and acceptable sacrifice to him; see [Isa
66:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#020.md).

The length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds, and
the breadth shall be ten thousand; the kind of measure is not expressed
in the original, so that it is a question whether reeds or cubits are
meant; some think the latter, and the rather, because mention is made of
them, [Eze 45:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#002.md), and it is added,

and of this measure shall thou measure the length of five and twenty
thousand; which, if understood of cubits, will greatly reduce the length
and breadth of this holy portion of the land; wherefore it is best to
take the largest measure, since that seems better to answer the design
of the Holy Ghost in this passage; and the rather, since this measure is
more proper to measure land with, and is that which the measurer is said
to have in his hand, [Eze 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#005.md), and
besides, the measure of the sanctuary, said to be five hundred square,
[Eze 45:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#002.md) was measured with the
measuring reed, and not the cubit, [Eze
42:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#016.md), and which therefore must be
supplied here; and a measuring reed being six cubits, by a cubit and a
hand's breath, [Eze 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#005.md), makes this
portion of land to be more than six times larger than if it was supposed
to be measured by the cubit; and twenty five thousand of this measure,
according to Cornelius Lapide, made five hundred miles, which was three
times as large as the land of Canaan; that being, as Jerom (u) says, a
hundred and sixty miles long, and forty six broad; and is a proof, that
the land of Canaan literally taken is not here meant; but the whole is
designed to set forth the amplitude and large extent of the church of
Christ in the world, in the times the vision refers to.

This shall be holy in all the borders thereof round about; that is, this
portion of land measured out, and distinguished from the rest: holiness
of heart and life shall appear in all the subjects of Christ's kingdom,
and members of his church, which becomes his house for ever.

\(u\) Ad Dardanum, tom. 3. fol. 21. I. K.

[Ezekiel 45:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 45:2</span></span>

Of this there shall be for the sanctuary,.... Or temple, the house
before described in the preceding chapters:

five hundred in length, and five hundred in breadth, square round about:
that is, five hundred reeds square, as is manifest from [Eze
42:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#016.md), and this denotes the largeness,
perfection, and stability of the church of Christ, which the sanctuary
was a type of:

and fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof; which were a void
place of fifty cubits round about the sanctuary, measuring from the wall
to that; this was done in reverence to the holy place, and to show that
we should not rush hastily into the house of God, and church of Christ,
but first pass through the suburbs or open place. Cubits being here
mentioned, show that reeds are to be understood where the kind of
measure is not expressed.

[Ezekiel 45:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 45:3</span></span>

And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty
thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand,.... Not that the sense is,
that of and according to the cubit measure last mentioned, this length
and this breadth should be measured; but "after this measure", as
Starckius renders it, and as the particle is rendered, [Dan
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#023.md) and which Sanctius mentions; and
Jerom seems to have understood it in this light: and the sense is, that
after he had finished the measure of five hundred reeds square, and
fifty cubits round, he should proceed to measure the rest of the twenty
five thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth:

and in it shall be the sanctuary, and the most holy place; that is, in
the midst portion of land, consisting of the above measures, be the holy
place, and the holy of holies; this is, but a further explanation of the
two preceding verses.

[Ezekiel 45:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 45:4</span></span>

The holy portion of the land shall be for the priests, the ministers of
the sanctuary,.... That is, the rest of it, which is not for the
sanctuary, shall be for the use of the priests that minister in holy
things in the sanctuary; either the ministers of the Gospel, who shall
have a sufficient maintenance from the churches of Christ, as the
priests had under the law: or it may be meant of all the saints, who are
priests unto God, and serve and worship him in his sanctuary; who shall
all be satisfied with the goodness and fatness of his house, the word
and ordinances, and the blessings of grace conveyed by them:

which shall come near to minister unto the Lord; these sons of Zadok,
these faithful ones, in the worst of times; see [Eze
44:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#015.md),

and it shall be a place for their houses; in this large spot shall be
many congregated churches, houses of the living God, where his priests
and people dwell, and will be serving and praising him:

and an holy place for the sanctuary; which may denote the church of God
in general, as houses may do particular churches.

[Ezekiel 45:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 45:5</span></span>

And the five and twenty thousand, of length, and ten thousand of
breadth,.... This seems to be another portion of the land, distinct from
the former, though of the same measure; see [Eze
48:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#013.md),

shall also the Levites, the ministers of the house, have for themselves;
separate from the priests, to whom they ministered, and were as
numerous; or more numerous, than they; this is still designed to set
forth the largeness of the church, and the great numbers of its members,
who will all be accommodated and supplied with good things:

for a possession for twenty chambers; which some understand of twenty
rows of chambers; by which may be meant particular congregated churches,
as we have seen all along in this vision, erected for the better use and
convenience of the saints in all places and parts of the world, where
they are called.

[Ezekiel 45:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 45:6</span></span>

And ye shall appoint the possession of the city, Which is something
distinct from the house or temple, which was as the frame of a city,
being so large, and consisting of so many parts, [Eze
40:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#002.md) and seems also different from the
city in [Eze 48:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#030.md), the measures of
the one and of the other not agreeing. Starckius thinks that this city
prefigures the academies that should be among Christians, in which the
priests or ministers of the word should teach those that came out of all
parts unto them; but I am rather of opinion that the civil state of the
people of God is here meant, as it will be in the spiritual reign of
Christ; when all civil power and authority will not as yet be put down,
only it will come into the hands of the saints, and be administered by
Christian kings and princes.

Five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, over against the
oblation of the holy portion; five thousand reeds in breadth are allowed
less for the civil than the church state; and though they are
contiguous, and there is a connection between them, yet are separate
from each other; the material temple was in the city of Jerusalem; but
the holy portion, in which the sanctuary shall be, is without the city,
and the city over against that; hence John seems, to have borrowed his
idea and language, "I saw no temple therein", [Rev
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#022.md), though speaking of another
city: the church and the world shall be no more mixed together; Christ's
kingdom is not of this world, nor to be fixed on a civil establishment:

it shall be for the whole house of Israel; they shall all be under one
and the same form of government; I do not say they shall be all under
one temporal king or prince; but all Christian kings and princes shall
exercise the same kind of rule and government; so that, as their church
state will be uniform, their civil state or polity will be alike.

[Ezekiel 45:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 45:7</span></span>

And a portion shall be for the prince,.... Meaning not the civil
magistrate; though he ought to be supported in his dignity and
authority, and in such manner that he may be under no temptation to
oppress his subjects; and who ought to be, and at this time will be, the
protector of the Lord's people, both in their civil and church state;
but the Prince Messiah, of whom see [Eze
44:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#003.md), to whom God will divide a
portion with the great; Jacob shall be his portion, the Heathen his
inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth his possession, [Isa
53:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012.md),

on the one side and on the other side of the oblation of the holy
portion, and of the possession of the city; on each side, both of the
holy portion, in which are the sanctuary, the houses of the priests, and
the chambers of the Levites, and also of the city for the house of
Israel; so that his portion will lie, or he be placed, on each side both
of the church state and civil state of the Lord's people, and so be the
protector of both; he will be a wall of fire round about them, a covert
and a hiding place for them; he will be near them, and they to him; he
will be on every side of them, and preserve them from persecuting
enemies, and false teachers; they shall enjoy his word, his ordinances,
and Gospel ministers, and be kept in the utmost peace and prosperity of
all kinds; he will protect and defend them, both in their civil and
religious liberties, and none shall make them afraid.

Before the oblation of the holy portion, and before the possession of
the city; or rather, "over against" them (w), as it is rendered, [Eze
41:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#015.md) so, as the possession of the
city was over against the holy portion, the portion of the prince was to
be over against them both:

from the west side westward, and from the east side eastward; which
explains on which sides of them it lay:

and the length shall be over against one of the portions; that is,
against everyone of the portions:

from the west border unto the east border; now as there is no measure
given to the portion of the prince, but the whole space eastward and
westward is left for it, it shows the large extent of Christ's kingdom;
that his dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the river to the
ends of the earth; his Gospel shall be preached everywhere; the Spirit
shall be poured down upon all flesh to make it successful; multitudes
shall be everywhere converted, and churches set up in all places; the
kingdoms of the world will become Christ's, even all the Pagan, Papal,
and Mahometan nations; Christ will be King over all the earth, and his
name shall be one; there will be but one religion everywhere, [Psa
72:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#008.md). Some of the Jewish writers
interpret this of the King Messiah, to whom they suppose is here
allotted the thirteenth part of the land: so Kimchi says,

"to Israel belong twelve parts or portions, and to the prince the
thirteenth part; the portion of the prince is as the portion of one of
the tribes in length and in breadth, excepting that within the
inheritance of the prince should be an oblation,''

as in [Eze 45:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#013), and Maimonides (x.md)
says,

"the King Messiah takes out of all lands, subdued by the Israelites, one
part out of thirteen; and this thing is a statute for him and his sons
for ever;''

which seems plainly to refer to this passage in Ezekiel; though there
are some who understand him of any anointed king of Israel, as being his
right: but the learned Selden (y) is of opinion that he is speaking of
the King Messiah, and has respect to this distribution; and rightly
observes, from the same author (z), that all that was subdued by him was
his own, and he could dispose of it at his pleasure to his servants and
soldiers.

[Ezekiel 45:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 45:8</span></span>

In the land shall be his possession in Israel,.... Or, "as for the land,
it shall be his for a possession in Israel" (a); the people of the land
shall be a people for possession, as in [Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009.md) or a peculiar people of his
throughout all Israel; all the spiritual Israel, whether Jew or Gentile,
shall be Christ's possession and inheritance:

and my princes shall no more oppress my people; neither ecclesiastical
princes, as the Scribes and Pharisees formerly, nor civil magistrates;
not the one with false doctrines, carnal rites and ceremonies; nor the
other with heavy taxes, and rigorous exactions:

and the rest of the land shall they give to the house of Israel
according to their tribes; the spiritual and mystical Israel, Jews and
Gentiles, who shall now inherit the earth, and possess all temporal good
things, as well as spiritual ones.

\(a\) "de terra vel quod attinet ad terram, sive terrae (illud), erit in
possessionem in Israel", Starckius.

[Ezekiel 45:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 45:9</span></span>

Thus saith the Lord, let it suffice you, O princes of Israel,....
Christian kings and princes, for such there shall be in those times; and
who will have large and ample salaries provided for them, as they should
have to support their dignity; and with which they should be content, as
they will be, and not encroach upon the properties of their subjects:

remove violence and spoil; from your administration; the sense is, do
not use violence, and exercise rapine and spoil, let these be far from
you; seize not on the goods of your subjects, or spoil them of them by
heavy taxes and impositions, or by vexatious lawsuits, and unjust
sentences:

and execute judgment and justice; between men; let everyone enjoy his
own property; and when any matter of controversy arises about it, fairly
hear and examine the case, and do justice:

take away your exactions from my people, saith the Lord; such as had
been exacted of them in former times by tyrannical and unjust princes:
or, "your expulsions" (b); driving them from their houses, estates,
fields, and vineyards; either by taking them away from them, and
annexing them to their own, as Ahab did; or by levying such taxes upon
them they could not pay, and so were obliged to leave their inheritances
and possessions. This, and some following verses, contain rules for
regulating the civil state of the people of God in the latter day; which
did not take place upon the Jews' return from Babylon, as appears from
[Neh 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#015.md) but will be strictly
observed by Christian princes in the latter day glory; see [Isa
40:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#017.md).

[Ezekiel 45:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 45:10</span></span>

Ye shall have just balances,.... That is, take care that true weights
and just measures be used in trade and commerce, that so one man may not
impose upon and cheat another; which is the business of the civil
magistrate to look after:

and a just ephah, and a just bath; and not make the ephah small, and the
shekel great, and falsifying the balances by deceit, as some did, [Amo
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#005.md) the "ephah" was a measure for dry
things, as wheat, barley, &c. and the "bath" for liquid things, as wine
oil, &c. as Jarchi and Kimchi observe; see [Lev
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#035.md).

[Ezekiel 45:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 45:11</span></span>

The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure,.... The one held as much
of dry things as the other of liquor; which, according to Bishop
Cumberland, were seven wine gallons, four pints, and a little more:

that the bath may contain the tenth part of an homer, and the ephah the
tenth part of an homer; this "homer" must be carefully distinguished
from another measure, called "omer", written without an "h", which was
but the tenth part of an "ephah", [Exo
16:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#036.md),

the measure thereof shall be after the homer: "as the homer was", so
should the ephah and bath be, just the tenth part of it.

[Ezekiel 45:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 45:12</span></span>

And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs,.... This is a rule for money or
coin; the shekel was a silver coin, and is generally reckoned about the
value of two shillings and six pence of our money, so a gerah about
three half pennies: Bishop Cumberland reckons the shekel more exactly at
two shillings and four pence farthing, and a little more, and the gerah
at eleven grains of silver; see [Lev
27:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#025.md),

twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your
maneh; these were several pieces of money; one was a twenty shekel
piece, which according to the common account was fifty shillings of our
money; another was a five and twenty shekel piece, which was three
pounds, two shillings, and sixpence; and a third was a fifteen shekel
piece, which was one pound thirteen and sixpence; and together made a
maneh or pound, which consisted of sixty shekels, or seven pounds, ten
shillings; by which the other pieces should be tried, whether they were
of just weight: the sense of the whole is, that no adulteration of coin
should be made, which is very prejudicial in civil affairs.

[Ezekiel 45:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 45:13</span></span>

This is the oblation that ye shall offer,.... Not at the dedication of
the temple, to be built in time to come, as Kimchi thinks; nor for the
daily sacrifices, as others; but for the maintenance of the priests,
that is, the ministers of the Gospel; for here begin the rules for the
right ordering of ecclesiastical affairs of those times:

the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of wheat, and ye shall give the
sixth part of an ephah of an homer of barley: this confirms that an
"ephah" was for dry measure, of wheat and barley; and as it was the
tenth part of an homer, a sixtieth part of an homer of wheat and barley
was to be given for this service; that is, if a man had an homer of
wheat or of barley, he was to give a sixtieth part of it for the use of
the ministers of the Lord: the meaning is, that the people should give
freely and liberally, according to their substance, for their support
and maintenance,

[Ezekiel 45:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 45:14</span></span>

Concerning the ordinance of oil, the bath of oil,.... This shows that
the bath was for liquid measure; and as oil was a part of food with the
Jews, as well as used in their offerings, a rule is given for the
distribution of that to the Lord's ministers, that they may have
everything convenient for them:

ye shall offer the tenth part of a bath out of a cor; which was the same
measure with the "homer", only another name for it, as follows:

which is an homer of ten baths, for ten baths are an homer; so that if a
man had an homer or ten baths of oil, he was to give a hundredth part of
it for the use of the priests and Levites, or ministers of the word; a
greater portion of wheat or barley is given than of oil, because there
is a greater expense in families of the one than of the other.

[Ezekiel 45:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 45:15</span></span>

And one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred,.... As provision is
before made for bread and oil, so here for meat for the servants of the
Lord: if a man had two hundred lambs in his flock, one of them was to be
given to them; it may be observed, that this plainly refers to times
when the Mosaic dispensation should be abrogated; not tithes of all
things are to be given to the priests, as heretofore; only the sixtieth
part of wheat and barley, the hundredth part of oil, and but one lamb of
two hundred; and which denotes the moderate maintenance of Gospel
ministers, with which they should be contented, and the people should
not grudge to give; nothing extraordinary or extravagant being required
of them: this lamb was to be taken

out of the fat pastures of Israel; or, out of the watery places (c); out
of those fields which were well watered, and produced good pasture,
which fattened the sheep and lambs that were fed in them; and denotes
that the best of the kind is to be given to the Lord, and to his
servants, or for the support of his interest; not the lean and the lame,
the halt and the blind, [Mal 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#008.md),

for a meat offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings;
not that the lamb was given for all these; but the wheat and the oil for
the meat offering, and the lamb for the burnt offering and peace
offerings. The sense may be, that this provision of wheat and barley,
oil and lambs, or the sufficient maintenance signified by them, was in
the room of the meat offering, burnt offerings, and peace offerings,
which fell to the share of the priests under the legal dispensation:

to make reconciliation for them, saith the Lord God; either to this end,
that the ministers of the Gospel, who have the word of reconciliation
committed to them, might cheerfully and faithfully dispense it to the
people; or that they, by these liberal and generous contributions of
theirs to the maintenance of them, might testify that they have truly by
faith received the atonement by the sacrifice of Christ.

All the people of the land shall give this oblation,.... None shall be
exempted from it; all according to their capacity and ability shall
contribute to the support of the ministry, and the service of religion:

for the prince in Israel; not the high priest, nor the civil magistrate,
but the Prince Messiah: or rather "to the prince in Israel" (d); what
the people shall do in this way, they shall do it as to the Lord, freely
and cordially, and for his honour and glory; and he will take it as done
to himself; see [Mat 10:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#041.md).

provide them; who is not the high priest, as Jarchi; nor the civil
magistrate or king, as Menachem; but Christ, who is both Prince and
Priest; and whose sacrifice of himself is designed by these, and the
other sacrifices after mentioned, of which the sacrifices were all
typical; though he is but one, they many, his answers to them all, and
is one for all; and though his is but once offered up, they often,
because of the fulness of efficacy in the one, and the want of it in the
other; and though in itself infinitely superior to these. Of the burnt
offerings, and of their being typical of Christ; see Gill on [Eze
40:39](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#039.md),

and meat offerings, and drink offerings; the meat offerings, which were
rather bread offerings, were made of fine flour, with oil poured, and
frankincense put thereon, [Lev 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001.md) and
were typical of Christ, compared to a corn of wheat dying in the earth,
and bringing forth fruit, [Joh 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#024.md)
and to wheat as bruised and ground into fine flour, kneaded and baked,
which may denote his various sufferings, and so made bread of; he being
the true and living bread, which gives life to men. The "oil" poured
upon this offering may signify the grace of the Spirit without measure
on Christ; and the "frankincense" how savoury and acceptable he is to
his people. The "drink offering" was of wine, which went along with
other sacrifices, and was very acceptable to God; and may denote the
blood of Christ, which is drink indeed; and his love expressed in
shedding it, which is better than the choicest wine; both these are held
forth, Christ's flesh, which is meat, and his blood, which is drink, in
the ordinance of the supper, administered by his priests, whom he
furnishes with such offerings to set before his saints:

in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, and in all
solemnities of the house of Israel; in the feasts of the passover,
tabernacle, and pentecost, which were all figures of Christ; of his
being the passover sacrificed for us, of his tabernacling in our nature,
and of the effusion of his Spirit; and the "new moons", and "sabbaths",
and "solemn days", are only Old Testament phrases to express the times
of New Testament worship; see [Isa
66:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#023.md), as monthly days for the
administration of the ordinance of the supper, and the Lord's day for
the preaching of the word, and other parts of public worship; in all
which the sacrifice of Christ, his blood, righteousness, and
satisfaction, make a principal part:

he shall prepare the sin offering; which also was a type of Christ; of
which See Gill on [Eze 40:39](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#039.md), and
this, with the

meat offering; and the burnt offering, of which before, were to be
prepared by the prince himself, or our Lord Jesus Christ: and also the
"peace offerings", or thank offerings (f); his own thank offerings for
himself and his people; see [Joh 11:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#041.md)
and the thank offerings of them, or their sacrifices of praise, which
become acceptable through him, [Heb
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015.md), and even himself, for whom the
saints offer thanks to God, [Co2 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#015.md),
and as the end of all the legal sacrifices was

to make reconciliation for the house of Israel; so this is the end and
use of the sacrifice of Christ, typified by them, to make peace for the
Israel of God; which could not be made by them, by their obedience,
repentance, or faith; and yet was necessary to their happiness, to their
communion with God, and enjoyment of him; this Christ has made by his
obedience, sufferings, and death, whereby he has fulfilled the law,
satisfied justice, and made atonement for sin: this is all at his
expense, and is meant by his "preparing" these offerings; which denotes
his ready and cheerful engagement to become a sacrifice; his voluntary
offering up himself unto God, or giving himself an offering and a
sacrifice unto him; and also his furnishing his ministers with proper
matter for their ministrations in all the solemn times and seasons
thereof, which is the doctrine of his sacrifice and satisfaction, or
salvation by a crucified Christ; and so as the people are to offer to
their maintenance, Christ the Prince takes care to furnish them for
their ministry.

[Ezekiel 45:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 45:18</span></span>

Thus saith the Lord God,.... Here begins the account of the times and
seasons in which the above sacrifices should be prepared and offered; or
that which was signified by them be held forth in the ministry of the
word to the faith of God's people:

in the first month, in the first day of the month; the month Nisan, as
Kimchi observes, who adds,

"which is the month of redemption, in which Israel were redeemed out of
Egypt, and in which they shall be redeemed in time to come:''

this month answers to part of our March and part of April; it was the
first month in the year with the Jews for their ecclesiastical affairs;
so that the first day of this month was New Year's Day:

thou shall take a young bullock without blemish, and cleanse the
sanctuary; or, "make a sin offering for it" (g); here the Jews are
puzzled; since, according to the law of Moses, in the beginnings of
their months, they were to offer a burnt offering of two young bullocks
and a ram, &c. [Num 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#011.md), whereas
here only one bullock, and that a sin offering; wherefore R. Jochanan
and R. Judah say, this must be left till Elijah comes to explain it; and
as much at a loss are they how to account for it that Ezekiel should do
this, whom they suppose to be the person spoken to; and therefore
imagine this will be done by him after the resurrection, not being able
to see that this shows the abrogation of the law of Moses; and that not
the Prophet Ezekiel, but Christ the Prince and Priest, is here
addressed; and whose sacrifice is designed by the young bullock without
blemish; a type of him both in his strength and purity; and by which his
sanctuary, his church and people, have all their sins expiated; and
particularly the sins of the year past, this being represented as done
on New Year's Day, which the annual atonement prefigured.

[Ezekiel 45:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 45:19</span></span>

And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering,.... An
emblem of the blood of Christ, who was made sin for his people, and an
offering for their sin; and which blood cleanses from all sin:

and put it upon the posts of the house; of the house of God, the
sanctuary or temple; upon everyone of the posts of it, which stood at
the entrance into it. The Targum is

"upon the threshold of the house:''

and upon the four corners of the settle of the altar; or four horns of
it; see [Eze 43:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#014.md),

and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court; that is, of the
temple: this is also a new rule or law about putting the blood of the
sacrifice into these various places, of which nothing is said in the law
of Moses; and shows that admission into the church of God, and the right
participation of Christ, the altar, and the blessings of his grace, as
well as entrance into heaven itself, are all through the blood of
Christ.

[Ezekiel 45:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 45:20</span></span>

And so thou shall do the seventh day of the month,.... Of the first
month Nisan; here is another new rule or law, as Kimchi owns, of which
no mention is made in the law of Moses:

for everyone that erreth, and for him that is simple: so shall ye
reconcile the house; or, "expiate" it (h); make atonement for it; that
is, for the house of God, the whole church, all his people; particularly
for fallen believers, who have gone astray, either in principle or
practice; through ignorance and simplicity, through the prevalence of
corruption, the temptations of Satan, and the snares of this world; but
are recovered again, and brought to repentance; to whom the doctrines of
peace and reconciliation, of free and full pardon by the blood of
Christ, and of atonement of all their sins by his sacrifice, are to be
preached for the comfort and refreshment of their souls; and they are to
be received into the church, having their consciences sprinkled by the
blood of Christ; the same things being done on this day as on the first.
Jarchi thinks these words are to be transposed thus,

and ye shall reconcile, or "expiate the house from the man that erreth,
and the simple one": quite contrary to the design of the text, which
directs to the reception, and not the exclusion, of such persons.

[Ezekiel 45:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 45:21</span></span>

In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month,.... Of the month
Nisan, that day fortnight from the cleansing of the sanctuary; and that
day week from the expiation of the house, and the recovery and reception
of backsliders:

ye shall have the passover; Christ the passover sacrificed for us; held
forth in the ministry of the word, and in the ordinance of the Lord's
supper; for the passover was a type of Christ: his purity and strength
were signified by the lamb without blemish, a male of the first year;
his separation to his office, his death, and the time of it, by the
taking of this lamb from the flock some time before, and by slaying it
between the two evenings; the manner of feeding on him, with fervent
faith, and as a whole Saviour, attended with true repentance, and being
willing also to suffer for him, by the lamb being eaten not raw, nor
sodden, but roasted, and all of it, and with bitter herbs; and the
security of his people by his blood from wrath and ruin, through the
sprinkling it upon their consciences, by the sprinkling the blood of the
passover on the lintel and door posts of the Israelites, which the Lord
seeing passed by, and destroyed them not; and the new rules of keeping
this passover, after observed, show that this respects not the type, but
the antitype:

a feast of seven days; kept a whole week; and indeed Christ the passover
is by faith to be lived upon throughout the week, as well as on Lord's
days, and indeed in every week:

unleavened bread shall be eaten; and not leavened; with reference to
which the Gospel feast is to be kept, not with old leaven, with the
leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of
sincerity and truth, [Co1 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#007.md).

[Ezekiel 45:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 45:22</span></span>

And upon that day,.... The fourteenth day of the month Nisan; the first
day of the passover, as Kimchi observes:

shall the prince prepare for himself, and for all the people of the
land, a bullock for a sin offering; here everything again is new, as the
above Jewish writer observes; no one circumstance according to the law
of Moses; which shows that this respects Gospel times; when the law
would be null and void, the types and shadows gone, and the antitype
take place, Christ the sum of all; under the law, every family was to
prepare a lamb for themselves; but here the prince is to prepare for
himself, and all the people of the land; by that it was to be a lamb,
here a bullock, and that for a sin offering; whereas not a bullock, but
a goat, was used for a sin offering. Christ himself is this Prince, and
who has prepared himself a sacrifice, even for himself, his church,
which is mystically himself; and to make atonement for all those sins
which he took upon himself by imputation, and made his own; even for all
his chosen people, and for all their sins: of his preparing this
sacrifice, both to be offered up, and to be held forth in the ministry
of the word; see Gill on [Eze 45:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#017.md),
and who is very fitly represented by a bullock for his labouriousness
and strength, in bearing the sins of his people, when he became an
offering for them.

[Ezekiel 45:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 45:23</span></span>

And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the
Lord,.... Which is as follows:

seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days; that
is, a bullock and a ram for each day:

and a kid of the goats daily for a sin offering; all which were typical
of Christ, signified by the "bullock", for his labour and patience; by
the "ram", for his strength; and by the kid of the goats, for his
likeness of sinful flesh, and having the sins of his people reckoned to
him; which made him of ill savour to the justice and holiness of God,
and for which he fell a sacrifice. This is also different from the law
of Moses, which required two young bullocks, one ram, and seven lambs,
[Num 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#019.md) and therefore Jarchi
confesses he knew not how to make this Scripture stand, or establish the
sense of it.

[Ezekiel 45:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 45:24</span></span>

And he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a bullock,.... Of
the meat offering; see Gill on [Eze
45:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#017.md), this was to consist of an ephah
of fine flour; and for every bullock on each of the seven days of the
passover was a meat offering of such a quantity to be made:

and an ephah for a ram; a like quantity of fine flour was to be made
into a meat offering for every ram on the same days:

and an hin of oil for an ephah; to every ephah of fine flour was, to be
allowed an hin of oil, which, according to Bishop Cumberland, was a
gallon and two pints, being the sixth part of an ephah or bath: here
also, as Kimchi observes, will be an innovation in the offerings in
future times, whether we will or not, he says; and Jarchi confesses his
ignorance of these things; since, according to the law, three tenth
parts of an ephah of fine flour were only allowed to make a meat
offering for one bullock, and two tenth parts for a ram, [Num
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#012.md), this may denote the more
abundance of grace, and of the knowledge of Christ, under the Gospel
dispensation, and especially in the latter day glory.

[Ezekiel 45:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 45:25</span></span>

In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month,.... The month
Tisri, which answers to part of our September and October:

shall he do the like in the feast of the seven days; the feast of
tabernacles, which began the fifteenth of Tisri, and was kept seven
days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, which is not here
taken notice of: this feast was in commemoration of the Jews dwelling in
tabernacles in the wilderness; and was typical of Christ's tabernacling
in our nature, or of his incarnation; and which feast is to be kept in
Gospel times, and particularly in the latter day, by believing in the
incarnate Saviour, and in all the blessings flowing from his
incarnation; and by attending the Gospel feast, his word and ordinances,
which hold him forth as the only Saviour; See Gill on [Zac
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016.md), now, the same things are to be
done at this feast as at the feast of the passover:

according to the sin offering, according to the burnt offering, and
according to the meat offering, and according to the oil: that is, so
many bullocks and rams for the burnt offering, and a kid of the goats
for the sin offering, as before; and the same quantity of fine flour and
oil for the meat offering: this also is a new thing, as Kimchi observes;
for, according to the law, the sacrifices at the feast of passover, and
at the feast of tabernacles, were very different; and it might be
further observed, that no notice is taken of the feast of pentecost, or
first fruits; and the whole confirms what has been already observed,
that this shows the abrogation of the Mosaic economy; and that these
things are to be understood in a spiritual and evangelic sense.
