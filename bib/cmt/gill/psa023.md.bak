INTRODUCTION TO PSALM 23

A Psalm of David. Thus psalm was written by David, either when he was in
distressed circumstances, being persecuted by Saul, and was in the
forest of Hareth, [Sa1 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#005.md); as some
think (r); wherefore he comforts himself with the Lord's being his
shepherd, so that he should not want; nor would he fear, was he in worse
circumstances than he at present was; or rather, when he was settled
upon the throne of Israel, and in the most prosperous and flourishing
state of his reign, as the latter part of the psalm shows; he speaks not
in his own person only, but in the name of all believers; for Christ,
who is the shepherd spoken of, is a common shepherd to all the saints,
who are all the sheep of his pasture, as well as David; and the prophet
here makes use of similes very familiar with him; he having been a
shepherd himself, and knew what it was to do all the parts of that
office, which are herein expressed; and very pertinently does this psalm
follow the former; for as there Christ is prophesied of as laying down
his life for the sheep, as the good shepherd does; and of his being
brought again from the dead, as the great shepherd of the sheep, as
Christ has been; so here of his performing his office as such, in all
its parts, to the great comfort, refreshment, and safety of his people.

[Psalms 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 23:1</span></span>

The Lord is my shepherd,.... This is to be understood not of Jehovah the
Father, and of his feeding the people of Israel in the wilderness, as
the Targum paraphrases it, though the character of a shepherd is
sometimes given to him, [Psa 77:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#020.md);
but of Jehovah the Son, to whom it is most frequently ascribed, [Gen
49:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#024.md). This office he was called and
appointed to by his Father, and which through his condescending grace he
undertook to execute, and for which he is abundantly qualified; being
omniscient, and so knows all his sheep and their maladies, where to find
them, what is their case, and what is to be done for them; and being
omnipotent, he can do everything proper for them; and having all power
in heaven and in earth, can protect, defend, and save them; and all the
treasures of wisdom and knowledge being in him, he can guide and direct
them in the best manner; wherefore he is called the great shepherd, and
the chief shepherd, and the good shepherd. David calls him "my
shepherd"; Christ having a right unto him, as he has to all the sheep of
God, by virtue of his Father's gift, his own purchase, and the power of
his grace; and as owning him as such, and yielding subjection to him,
following him as the sheep of Christ do wheresoever he goes; and also as
expressing his faith of interest in him, affection for him, and joy
because of him: and from thence comfortably concludes,

I shall not want; not anything, as the Targum and Aben Ezra interpret
it; not any temporal good thing, as none of Christ's sheep do, that he
in his wisdom sees proper and convenient for them; nor any spiritual
good things, since a fulness of them is in him, out of which all their
wants are supplied; they cannot want food, for by him they go in and out
and find pasture; in him their bread is given them, where they have
enough and to spare, and their waters are sure unto them; nor clothing,
for he is the Lord their righteousness, and they are clothed with the
robe of his righteousness; nor rest, for he is their resting place, in
whom they find rest for their souls, and are by him led to waters of
rest, as in [Psa 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#002.md), the words may
be rendered, "I shall not fail", or "come short" (s); that is, of
eternal glory and happiness; for Christ's sheep are in his hands, out of
which none can pluck them, and therefore shall not perish, but have
everlasting life, [Joh 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#027.md).

[Psalms 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 23:2</span></span>

He maketh me to lie down in green pastures,.... Or "pastures of tender
grass" (t); this is one part of the shepherd's work, and which is
performed by Christ, [Eze 34:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#014.md); by
these "green pastures" may be meant the covenant of grace, its blessings
and promises, where there is delicious feeding; likewise the fulness of
grace in Christ, from whence grace for grace is received; also the flesh
and blood, righteousness and sacrifice, of Christ, which faith is led
unto and lives upon, and is refreshed and invigorated by; to which may
be added the doctrines of the Gospel, with which Christ's
under-shepherds feed his lambs and sheep, there being in them milk for
babes and meat for strong men; and likewise the ordinances of the
Gospel, the goodness and fatness of the Lord's house, the feast of fat
things, and breasts of consolation: here Christ's sheep are made to "lie
down", denoting their satiety and fulness; they having in these green
pastures what is satisfying and replenishing; as also their rest and
safety, these being sure dwellings and quiet resting places, even in the
noon of temptation and persecution; see [Sol
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#007.md);

he leadeth me beside the still waters, or "waters of rest and quietness"
(u); not to rapid torrents, which by reason of the noise they make, and
the swiftness of their motion, the sheep are frightened, and not able to
drink of them; but to still waters, pure and clear, and motionless, or
that go softly, like the waters of Shiloah, [Isa
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#006.md); and the "leading" to them is in a
gentle way, easily, as they are able to bear it; so Jacob led his flock,
[Gen 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#014.md); and Christ leads his, [Isa
40:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#011.md); by these "still waters" may be
designed the everlasting love of God, which is like a river, the streams
whereof make glad the hearts of his people; these are the waters of the
sanctuary, which rise to the ankles, knees, and loins, and are as a
broad river to swim in; the pure river of water of life Christ leads his
sheep to, and gives them to drink freely of: also communion with God,
which the saints pant after, as the hart pants after the water brooks,
and Christ gives access unto; moreover he himself is the fountain of
gardens, and well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon; and the
graces of his Spirit are also as rivers of living water, all which he
makes his people partakers of; to which may be added, that the
Scriptures, and the truths of the Gospel, are like still, quiet, and
refreshing waters to them, and are the waters to which those that are
athirst are invited to come, [Isa
55:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001.md); and in the immortal state Christ
will still be a shepherd, and will feed his people, and lead them to
fountains of living water, where they shall solace themselves for ever,
and shall know no more sorrow and sighing, [Rev
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#017.md).

[Psalms 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 23:3</span></span>

He restoreth my soul,.... Either when backslidden, and brings it back
again when led or driven away, and heals its backslidings; or rather,
when fainting, swooning, and ready to die away, he fetches it back
again, relieves, refreshes, and comforts with the discoveries of his
love, with the promises of his word, and with the consolations of his
Spirit, and such like reviving cordials; see Gill on [Psa
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#007.md);

he leadeth, he in the paths of righteousness; in the plain paths of
truth and holiness, in which men, though fools, shall not err; in right
ones, though they sometimes seem rough and rugged to Christ's sheep, yet
are not crooked; there is no turning to the right hand or the left; they
lead straight on to the city of habitation; and they are righteous ones,
as paths of duty are, and all the commandments and ordinances of the
Lord be; moreover, Christ leads his by faith, to walk on in him and in
his righteousness, looking through it, and on account of it, for eternal
life; see [Pro 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#020.md); and all this he
does

for his name's sake; for his own glory and the praise of his grace, and
not for any merits or deserts in men.

[Psalms 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 23:4</span></span>

Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,.... Which
designs not a state of spiritual darkness and ignorance, as sitting in
the shadow of death sometimes does, since the psalmist cannot be
supposed to be at this time or after in such a condition; see [Isa
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#002.md); nor desertion or the hidings of
God's face, which is sometimes the case of the people of God, and was
the case of the psalmist at times; but now he expressly says the Lord
was with him; but rather, since the grave is called the land of the
shadow of death, and the distresses persons are usually in, under
apprehensions of immediate death, are called the terrors of the shadow
of death; see [Job 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#021.md); the case
supposed is, that should his soul draw nigh to the grave, and the
sorrows of death compass him about, and he should be upon the brink and
borders of eternity, he should be fearless of evil, and sing, "O death!
where is thy sting? O grave! where is thy victory?" [Co1
15:55](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#055.md), though it seems best of all to
interpret it of the most severe and terrible affliction or dark
dispensation of Providence it could be thought he should ever come
under, [Psa 44:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#019.md). The Targum
interprets it of captivity, and Jarchi and Kimchi of the wilderness of
Ziph, in which David was when pursued by Saul; and the latter also,
together with Ben Melech, of the grave, and of a place of danger and of
distress, which is like unto the grave, that is, a place of darkness;
and Aben Ezra of some grievous calamity, which God had decreed to bring
into the world. Suidas (w) interprets this phrase of danger leading to
death; afflictions attend the people of God in this life; there is a
continued series of them, so that they may be said to walk in them;
these are the way in which they walk heaven, and through which they
enter the kingdom; for though they continue long, and one affliction
comes after another, yet there will be an end at last; they will walk
and wade through them, and come out of great tribulations; and in the
midst of such dark dispensations, comparable to a dark and gloomy
valley, covered with the shadow of death, the psalmist intimates what
would be the inward disposition of his mind, and what his conduct and
behaviour:

I will fear no evil; neither the evil one Satan, who is the wolf that
comes to the flock to kill and to destroy, and the roaring lion that
seeks whom he may devour, since the Lord was his shepherd, and on his
side: nor evil men, who kill the body and can do no more, [Psa
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001.md); nor any evil thing, the worst
calamity that could befall him, since everything of this kind is
determined by God, and comes not without his knowledge and will, and
works for good, and cannot separate from the love of Christ; see [Psa
46:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001.md);

for thou art with me; sheep are timorous creatures, and so are Christ's
people; but when he the shepherd is them, to sympathize with them under
all their afflictions, to revive and comfort them with the cordials of
his love and promises of his grace, to bear them up and support them
with his mighty arm of power, to teach and instruct them by every
providence, and sanctify all unto them; their fears are driven away, and
they pass through the dark valley, the deep waters, and fiery trials,
with courage and cheerfulness; see [Isa
41:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#010.md);

thy rod and thy staff they comfort me; not the rod of afflictions and
chastisements, which is the sense of some Jewish (x) as well as
Christian interpreters; though these are in love, and the saints have
often much consolation under them; but these are designed by the valley
of the shadow of death, and cannot have a place here, but rather the rod
of the word, called the rod of Christ's strength, and the staff of the
promises and the provisions of God's house, the whole staff and stay of
bread and water, which are sure unto the saints, and refresh and comfort
them. The Targum interprets the rod and staff of the word and law of
God; and those interpreters who explain the rod of afflictions, yet by
the staff understand the law; and Jarchi expounds it, of the mercy of
God in the remission of sin, in which the psalmist trusted: the allusion
is to the shepherd's crook or staff, as in other places; see [Mic
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#014.md); which was made use of for the
telling and numbering of the sheep, [Lev
27:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#032.md); and it is no small comfort to
the sheep of Christ that they have passed under his rod, who has told
them, and that they are all numbered by him; not only their persons, but
the very hairs of their head; and that they are under his care and
protection: the shepherd with his rod, staff, or crook, directs the
sheep where to go, pushes forward those that are behind, and fetches
back those that go astray; as well as drives away dogs, wolves, bears,
&c. that would make a prey of the flock; and of such use is the word of
God, attended with the power of Christ and his Spirit; it points out the
path of faith, truth, and holiness, the saints should walk in; it urges
and stirs up those that are negligent to the discharge of their duty,
and is the means of reclaiming backsliders, and of preserving the flock
from the ravenous wolves of false teachers: in a word, the presence,
power, and protection of Christ, in and by is Gospel and ordinances, are
what are here intended, and which are the comfort and safety of his
people, in the worst of times and cases.

[Psalms 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 23:5</span></span>

Thou preparest a table before me,.... In a providential way granting a
sufficiency, and even an affluence of temporal good things; the
providence of God lays and spreads a table for his people in the
wilderness, and sets them down at it, and bids them welcome to it; see
[Psa 78:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#019.md); and in a way of grace, the
Lord making large provisions in his house for them, called the goodness
and fatness of his house, and a feast of fat things; and under the
Gospel dispensation, the table of the Lord, on which are set his flesh
and blood for faith to feed upon; see [Pro
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#002.md); and also in heaven, the joys of
which are compared to a feast, and the enjoyment of them to sitting at a
table, and which are prepared by the Lord for his people, from the
foundation of the world; and of which they have some foresight and
foretaste in this world; see [Luk
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#030.md); and all this

in the presence of my enemies; they seeing and envying the outward
prosperity of the saints, whenever they enjoy it, and their liberty of
worshipping God, hearing his word, and attending on his ordinances, none
making them afraid; as they will see, and envy, and be distressed at a
more glorious state of the church yet to come, [Rev
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#012.md); and even, as it should seem
from the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, the glory and happiness of
the saints in the other world will be seen, or by some way or other
known, by wicked men; which will be an affliction to them, and an
aggravation of their misery; though here it seems chiefly to regard the
present life. Some have thought there is an allusion to princes, who,
having conquered others, eat and feast at a well spread table in the
presence of the conquered, and they being under it; see [Jdg
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#007.md);

thou anointest my head with oil; giving him an abundance of good things,
not only for necessity, but for pleasure and delight; especially pouring
out largely upon him the oil of gladness, the Spirit of God and his
graces, the anointing which teaches all things, and filling him with
spiritual joy and comfort; for this refers not to the anointing of David
with material oil for the kingdom, by Samuel, while Saul was living, or
by the men of Judah, and afterwards by all the tribes of Israel, when
Saul was dead. The allusion is to the custom of the eastern countries,
at feasts, to anoint the heads of the guests with oil; see [Ecc
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#007.md). It was usual to anoint the head,
as well as other parts of the body, on certain occasions; hence that of
Propertius (y): and in the times before Homer (z) it was usual both to
wash and anoint before meals, and not the head only, but the feet also;
which, though Pliny (a) represents as luxurious, was in use in Christ's
time, [Luk 7:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#038.md); and spoken of as an
ancient custom by Aristophanes (b) his Scholiast for daughters to anoint
the feet of their parents after they had washed them; which may serve to
illustrate the passage in the Gospel; see [Ecc
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#008.md);

my cup runneth over; denoting an affluence of temporal good things, and
especially of spiritual ones, which was David's case. Such who are
blessed with all spiritual blessings in Christ, to whom the grace of the
Lord has been exceeding abundant, and the Lord himself is the portion of
their cup, their cup may be said to run over indeed.

[Psalms 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 23:6</span></span>

Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me,.... Either the free grace,
love, favour, and mercy of God in Christ, which endures continually, and
is always the same from everlasting to everlasting; or the effects of
it; and these either temporal good things, which flow from the goodness
and mercy of God, and not the merits of men; and which are in great
mercy and loving kindness bestowed on his people, and which follow them:
they do not anxiously seek after them; but seeking the kingdom of God
and his righteousness, these are added to them, they trusting in the
Lord, and he caring for them: or spiritual good things, which arise from
the mere grace and mercy of God; such as the blessings of the covenant,
the sure mercies of David, the discoveries and instances of the love of
God, and the provisions of his house, which follow them, being
undeserving of them; and even when they have backslidden from the Lord,
and in times of distress, when his grace is sufficient for them; and of
all this the psalmist had a comfortable assurance, depending upon the
promise of God, arguing from the blessings he had already bestowed, and
from the constant care he takes of his people, having in view his
unchangeableness and faithfulness, the firmness of his covenant, and the
irreversibleness of the blessings of it: the words may be rendered "only
goodness and mercy", &c. (c) nothing but mere mercy and kindness; for
though afflictions do attend the children of God, yet these are in mercy
and love; there is no fury in the Lord against them; there is nothing
comes in wrath to them, throughout the whole course of their lives;
wherefore it is added,

all the days of my life; the mercies of God are new every morning, they
continue all the day long; temporal goodness abides as long as life
lasts, and ends with it; and spiritual blessings are for ever, they are
the gifts of God, which are without repentance;

and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever; which may denote his
constant attendance on the public worship of God, of which he had been
deprived in time past, being driven out from it, but now he enjoyed it,
and believed he ever should; or it may design his being a member of the
church of God, and a pillar in the house and temple of the Lord, that
should never go out; see [Rev 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012.md); or
it may regard the assurance he had of dwelling in the house not made
with hands, eternal, in the heavens, Christ's Father's house, in which
are many mansions, sure dwellings, and quiet resting places for his
people, and that to all eternity. The Targum interprets it of the house
of the sanctuary; and Kimchi expounds the whole verse in a petitionary
way, "may goodness and mercy", &c.
