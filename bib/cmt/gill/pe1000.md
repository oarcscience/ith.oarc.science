INTRODUCTION TO 1 PETER

That Simon, called Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, was the writer of
this epistle, is not questioned by any; nor was the genuineness and
authenticity of it ever made a doubt of. Eusebius says (a), that it had
been confessed by all, and received without controversy; and that the
ancients, without any scruple, had made use of it in their writings. It
is called his "general", or catholic epistle, because it was not written
to any particular person, or to any particular church, but in general,
to a number of Christians dispersed in several places. The time when
this epistle was written is not certain; some place it in the year of
Christ 44 or 45, and so make it to be the most ancient of all the
epistles, and which is the more commonly received opinion; but Dr.
Lightfoot (b) places it in the year 65, because in it the apostle speaks
of the end of all things being at hand, and of the fiery trial just
coming on them, and of judgment beginning at the house of God, [Pe1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#007.md) all which he applies to the
destruction of Jerusalem; though others fix it to 61, in the seventh
year of Nero (c). The place from whence it seems to be written was
Babylon, [Pe1 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#013.md) which is to be
understood not figuratively, either of Rome or Jerusalem, but properly
of Babylon, the metropolis of Chaldea, or Assyria. The persons to whom
it is written were Jews, at least chiefly; for there might be some
Gentiles among them, who may be taken notice of in some parts of the
epistle; but the principal part were Jews, as appears from their being
called the strangers of the dispersion, or, as James calls them, "the
twelve tribes scattered abroad"; from the mention of the tradition of
their fathers; from their having their conversation honest among the
Gentiles, and their past life among them; from urging subjection to the
civil magistrates among the Heathens, and the right use of their
Christian liberty as to the ceremonies of the law; and from the near
destruction of Jerusalem, which could only affect them; and from the use
made of the writings of the Old Testament, and the authority of the
prophets; see [Pe1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001.md) as well as from
the second epistle, which was written to the same; see [Pe2
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#019.md) in which he seems to refer to the
epistle to the Hebrews, written by Paul, as to these. And besides, Peter
was the minister of the circumcision, or of the circumcised Jews, as
Paul was of the Gentiles; and even those passages in this epistle, which
seem most likely to concern the Gentiles, may be understood of the Jews,
as which speak of their ignorance, idolatry, and having not been a
people, [Pe1 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#014.md) which were true of
them before conversion, and as living among Gentiles. The occasion of
writing it was this; Peter meeting with Sylvanus, a faithful brother,
and who had been a companion of the Apostle Paul, he takes this
opportunity of sending a letter by him to the converted Jews, dispersed
among the Gentile countries, where he, with Paul, and others, travelled:
the design of which is to testify of the true doctrine of grace, in
which they were agreed; see [Pe1 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#012.md).
And accordingly in it he does treat of the doctrine of electing grace,
of redeeming grace, of regenerating and sanctifying grace, and of
persevering grace; and exhorts believers to the exercise of grace, of
faith, hope, and love, and to the discharge of such duties becoming
their several stations, whereby they might evidence to others the truth
of grace in themselves, and adorn the doctrine of the grace of God, and
recommend it to others: and particularly he exhorts them patiently to
bear all afflictions and persecutions they should meet with, for their
profession of the true grace of God, in which he encourages them to
stand steadfast: and this is the general scope and design of the
epistle.
