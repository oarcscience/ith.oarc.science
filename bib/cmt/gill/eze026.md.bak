INTRODUCTION TO EZEKIEL 26

This chapter contains a prophecy of the destruction of Tyre. The time of
the prophecy, [Eze 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#001.md), the cause of
the destruction of it, rejoicing at the ruin of Jerusalem, [Eze
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#002.md), the instruments of it, many
nations, particularly the king of Babylon, [Eze
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#003.md), the manner in which it shall be
done, [Eze 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#008.md), the lamentation of
other isles, and the princes of them, on account of it, [Eze
26:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#015.md), the utter destruction of it, so
as never to be found any more, [Eze
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#019.md).

[Ezekiel 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 26:1</span></span>

And it came to pass in the eleventh year,.... Of Jehoiachin's captivity
and Zedekiah's reign, the same year that Jerusalem was taken:

in the first day of the month; but what month is not mentioned; some
have thought the first month, and so it was the first day of the year;
others the fourth, the same in which the city of Jerusalem was taken;
but more probably the fifth, the first of which was twenty days after
the taking it; in which time the news of it might be brought to Tyre, at
which she rejoiced; and for which her destruction is threatened, and
here prophesied of:

that the word of the Lord came unto me, saying; as follows:

[Ezekiel 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 26:2</span></span>

Son of man, because that Tyrus hath said against Jerusalem, aha,.... As
rejoicing at her destruction, and insulting over her in it; which was
barbarous and inhuman, and resented by the Lord:

she is broken that was the gates of the people; through whose gates the
people went in and out in great numbers; a city to which there was very
popular, not only for religion, from all parts, at their solemn feasts,
but for merchandise from several parts of the world; and was now full of
people before its destruction, the inhabitants of Judea having fled
thither for safety, upon the invasion made by the king of Babylon; but
now the city was broken up, as it is said it was, by the Chaldean army,
[Jer 52:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#007.md), its gates and walls were
broken down, and lay in a ruinous condition. The Targum is,

"she is broken down that afforded merchandise to all people.''

She is turned unto me; either the inhabitants of Jerusalem, which
escaped and fled to Tyre for refuge; or the spoil taken out of it, which
was carried there to be sold; and even the captives themselves to be
sold for slaves, which was one part of the merchandise of Tyre; see [Eze
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#003.md), or the business, trade, and
merchandise carried on in Jerusalem, were brought to Tyre upon its
destruction; so Jarchi and Kimchi. The Targum is,

"she is turned to come unto me;''

which favours the first sense; all may be intended.

I shall be replenished, now she is laid waste; or, "I shall be filled"
(b); with inhabitants, riches, and wealth, with merchants and
merchandise, Jerusalem her rival being destroyed; this was what gave her
joy; and is a common thing for persons to rejoice at the fall or death
of those of the same trade with them; hoping for an increase of theirs
by means of it, which yet is sinful.

[Ezekiel 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 26:3</span></span>

Therefore thus saith the Lord God,.... Who knew the thoughts of the
inhabitants of Tyre, and what joy possessed their hearts, and which
their lips expressed; and who informs the prophet of it, though at a
great distance, and declares his resentment at it:

behold, I am against thee, O Tyrus; and nothing can be more dreadful and
formidable than to have God against a nation, city, or a particular
person: Tyre was a type of antichrist, who will express a like joy at
the death of the witnesses; thinking that the merchandise of Rome will
be increased greatly, and there will be nothing to interrupt it, [Rev
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#010.md), but God will show his
displeasure, and bring sudden destruction on it:

and will cause many nations to come up against thee, as the sea causeth
his waves to come up; the Chaldean army, consisting of soldiers of many
nations; who for their number, noise, and fury, are compared to the
raging waves of the sea. So the Targum,

"I will bring up against thee an army of many people, as the sea
ascendeth in the raging of its waves;''

the ten kings shall hate the whore, and destroy her, even those very
people she reigns over, compared to many waters, [Rev
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#015.md).

[Ezekiel 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 26:4</span></span>

And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus.... Undermining them, or
breaking them down with their battering rams:

and break down her towers; with axes, [Eze
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#009.md) built upon the walls; erected for
the defence of the city, and for watchmen to stand in, to look out from
them for the enemy, and observe his motions, as well as for soldiers to
fight from:

and I will scrape her dust from her, and make her like the top of a
rock; a bare smooth rock, which has not any surface of earth upon it. So
the Targum,

"I will give her for the smoothness of an open rock.''

Tyre was built upon a rock; and whereas the inhabitants had brought
earth thither, and laid it upon it, in order to make gardens and
orchards, and plant flowers and trees; this should be all removed, and
it should become a bare rock, as it was at first. It denotes the utter
destruction of it. It has its name from a word which signifies a rock;
See Gill on [Isa 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#001.md).

[Ezekiel 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 26:5</span></span>

It shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the
sea,.... Where only fishermen would be seen washing their nets, and then
spreading them upon this rock, where Tyre stood, to dry them and this
has been confirmed by travellers, who have seen fishermen spreading and
drying their nets, and having no other habitations on it but the huts of
these men. Huetius (c) relates, that he remembered one Hadrian
Parvillarius, a Jesuit, a candid and learned man, particularly in the
Arabic language, who lived ten years in Syria; and to have heard him
say, that when he saw the ruins of Tyre, its rocks to the sea, and
scattered stones on the shore, and made clean smooth by the sun, waves,
and wind, and only used for drying fishermen's nets, it brought to his
mind this passage of the prophet; as it did to Mr. Maundrell (d) when on
the spot, a few years ago; who says,

"you see nothing here but a mere Babel of broken walls, pillars, vaults,
&c. there being not so much as one entire house left; its present
inhabitants are only a few poor wretches, harbouring themselves in the
vaults, and subsisting chiefly upon fishing; who seem to be preserved in
this place by divine Providence, as a visible argument how God has
fulfilled his word concerning Tyre, viz. "that it should be as the top
of a rock", &c.'':

so Dr. Shaw (e) says, this port, small as it at present, is choked up to
that degree with sand and rubbish, that the boats of these poor
fishermen, who now and then visit this once renowned emporium and "dry
their nets upon its rocks and ruins", can with great difficulty only be
admitted:

for I have spoken it, saith the Lord God; and therefore it should
certainly come to pass, as it has:

and it shall become a spoil to the nations; the army of many nations,
that besieged it for thirteen years under Nebuchadnezzar.

[Ezekiel 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 26:6</span></span>

And her daughters which are in the field shall be slain by the
sword,.... That is, the inhabitants of the cities, towns, and villages,
on the shore near it, and which were subject to it; as such cities are
frequently in Scripture called the daughters of the place to which they
belong: or their daughters literally, that should get out of the city,
and endeavour to make their escape; yet should fall into the enemies'
hands, who would not spare them on account of their sex or age. The
Targum favours the former sense, as most of the Jewish writers do, which
is,

"and the inhabitants of the villages which are in the field shall be
killed by the sword:''

and they shall know that I am the Lord: the true God, and not Hercules
or Apollo, or any other idols they worshipped; when they shall see all
these things exactly accomplished, now prophesied of; which none but the
omniscient God could foretell.

[Ezekiel 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 26:7</span></span>

For thus saith the Lord God,.... What follows; and declares by name the
person that should be the instrument of this ruin, and the manner in
which it should be brought about:

I will bring upon Tyrus Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon; a prince whose
name was terrible, having conquered many nations: the Lord is said to
bring him against Tyre, because, he inclined his heart to steer his
course this way; encouraged him to this work; led and protected his
army; and, at last, gave him success: it held out thirteen years against
him, and then was taken. The siege began, according to Mr. Whiston (f),
A.M. 3650 or before Christ 586; and was taken A.M. 3663 or before Christ
573; according to Bishop Usher, (g), it began A.M. 3419 or before Christ
585; and was taken A.M. 3432 or before Christ 572. The Phoenician
historians make mention of the siege of Tyre by Nebuchadnezzar; and
Berosus speaks of his subduing the whole country of Phoenicia, in which
Tyre was; with whom agree Philostratus and Megasthenes (h):

a king of kings from the north; who had many kings tributaries to him;
the metropolis of whose kingdom lay somewhat, though not fully, north to
Tyre:

with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies, and
much people: with a very numerous army, consisting of a large cavalry;
horses being very numerous in the countries subject to him; and which he
mounted his men on, both for their more easy travelling, and for their
better fighting, and for the terror of their enemies.

[Ezekiel 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 26:8</span></span>

He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field,.... The first
thing he would do would be to destroy the cities, towns and villages on
the continent, near to Tyre, and dependent on it, as in [Eze
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#006.md), and so the Targum is here, as
there:

and he shall make a fort against thee, and cast a mount against thee; a
fort built of wood, and a mount made of earth, from which stones might
be cast out of their engines, and arrows shot from their bows into the
city, to the damaging of the houses, and the hurt of the inhabitants:

and lift up the buckler against thee; or "shield"; that is, as the
Targum paraphrases it,

"set against thee such who are armed with shields;''

to repel the arrows shot out from the city, and so defeat the design of
them.

[Ezekiel 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 26:9</span></span>

And he shall set engines of war against thy walls,.... Which some Jewish
writers understand of crossbows, out of which stones or arrows were
cast; but rather, according to Kimchi and Jarchi, they were warlike
machines, invented to throw large stones against the walls of a place,
to beat them down. Some think they were the same with the battering
rams, used in sieges for the demolishing of walls; which was a late
invention of those times, Ezekiel being the first writer, it is said,
that makes mention of them:

and with his axes he shall break down thy towers; the word here used
signifies anything made of iron, as swords, spears, hammers, and axes;
the latter, being more proper to demolish towers, is here pitched on by
our translators. The Targum renders it, "with stones of iron"; that is,
with iron balls cast out of their engines.

[Ezekiel 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 26:10</span></span>

By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover
thee,.... The dust raised by the feet of the horses so numerous, should
rise in such quantities, and to such a height, as to be like a cloud,
which should cover the city; an hyperbolical way of speaking, as Kimchi
observes; as is also the following clause:

thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wheels,
and of the chariots; at the shouts of the horsemen upon every attack,
and the rattling of the chariot wheels running to and fro, in carrying
on their designs:

when ye shall enter into thy gates; that is, then particularly shall
such a shout be made by the horsemen, and such rattling of the chariots,
as will even make the walls of the city to shake; an excess of
expression, signifying the prodigious noise made at their entrance into
it: as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach; or, "according to
the entrance of a city broken up" (i); when its walls are broken down,
and a gap is made; at which men rush in in great numbers, and with great
force and clamour.

[Ezekiel 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 26:11</span></span>

With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets,....
Such a number of horses running to and fro in the streets, and prancing
upon the pavements, shall break them up, and destroy them, so that they
shall be mere mire and dirt:

he shall slay thy people by the sword; such as would not lay down their
arms and submit; or their principal ones, who encouraged the inhabitants
to hold out the siege to such a length of time as they did; which might
provoke Nebuchadnezzar to use them with more severity:

and thy strong garrisons shall go down to the ground: where their
soldiers were placed for defence; their citadel and other towers: or,
"the statues of thy strengths" (k); their strong statues made of marble,
&c. erected as trophies of victories obtained by them; or to the honour
of some worthy magistrates, and principal citizens; or of their
confederates and allies; or rather of their deities, such as Hercules
and Apollo, their tutelar gods; which, though chained as they were, that
they might not depart, shall now fall to the ground, unable to protect
themselves or their worshippers: all that is here said, concerning the
destruction of Tyre by Nebuchadnezzar, seems to be understood of old
Tyre, which was upon the continent; for this account agrees not with the
isle.

[Ezekiel 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 26:12</span></span>

And they shall make a spoil of thy riches,.... The Chaldean army, when
they entered the city, and got possession of it, would plunder it, and
divide the riches of it among them:

and make a prey of thy merchandise; of the merchants' goods, laid up in
their warehouses for sale, which was greatly hindered by this long
siege; compare with this [Rev 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#011.md),

and they shall break down thy walls; the walls of their houses; mention
being made before of breaking down the walls of the city, towers, and
garrisons:

and destroy thy pleasant houses; or, "houses of thy desire" (l); the
most desirable ones in the city; the houses of their princes and chief
magistrates; their summer houses; or which were most delightfully
situated towards the sea, to have the prospect and advantage of that:

and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst
of the water; of the sea, near unto or about it; into which they cast
the rubbish of the demolished houses, stones, timber, and dust, and so
left it bare and naked: or rather this was fulfilled when Alexander,
with the ruins of old Tyre, its stones, timber, and rubbish, and trees
from Lebanon, made a causeway from the continent to the island; and by
that means took it, after seven months' toil and labour of this sort
(m).

[Ezekiel 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 26:13</span></span>

And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease,.... As this city
abounded with riches, so with carnal mirth and pleasure; it was a
"joyous city", [Isa 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#007.md), the
inhabitants lived merrily and jovially; were much given to music, which
was very diverting and amusing to foreigners that traded with them; but
now it would be all over with them; there would be no more songs, nor
any to sing them:

and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard; neither vocal nor
instrumental music; and this will be one day the case of Rome, of which
Tyre was a type, [Rev 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#022.md).

[Ezekiel 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 26:14</span></span>

And I will make thee like the top of a rock,.... Smooth and bare; See
Gill on [Eze 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#004.md),

and thou shall be a place to spread nets upon; See Gill on [Eze
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#005.md),

thou shalt be built no more: this must be understood with some
restriction and limitation; as that it should not be built any more in
the same stately manner; or be raised to royal dignity, and be governed
in the grand manner it had been; or be built upon the same spot; or
after its last destruction, to which the prophecy may have respect; it
being usual in Scripture for prophecies to regard what is more remote as
well as more near; for, upon the destruction of it by Nebuchadnezzar, it
was to be restored after seventy years, according to Isaiah's prophecy,
[Isa 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#015.md) and, many years after this,
new Tyre was besieged, taken, and destroyed by Alexander; and after this
it was rebuilt; we read of it in the New Testament; See Gill on [Act
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#003.md), and in Jerom's time it was a
most noble and beautiful city, as he on this passage observes; indeed,
as Kimchi says, who lived near a thousand years after Jerom, the city
then built in his time called Tyre was built upon the continent near the
seashore; whereas Tyre destroyed by Alexander was built in the midst of
the sea, and was as the top of a rock. It has since been destroyed by
Saladine, in the year 1291; and now quite uninhabited, unless by
fishermen, who wash, dry, and mend their nets here:

for I the Lord have spoken it, saith, the Lord God; and therefore it
shall be accomplished, as it has been; no more of his returning void,
and becoming of no effect. The Targum is,

"because I the Lord have decreed by my word, saith the Lord God;''

it is a determination and resolution of his, and none can disannul it.
Abendana thinks that hitherto the prophecy is concerning the first
destruction of Tyre by Nebuchadnezzar, and what follows is concerning
the destruction of it by Alexander.

[Ezekiel 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 26:15</span></span>

Thus saith the Lord God to Tyrus,.... By his prophet, who very probably
delivered this prophecy to the ambassadors of Tyre at Babylon; or to
some of their merchants that traded there; or sent it in a letter to
them:

shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall; when they hear the
noise of Tyre being taken, it will make them tremble, as fearing their
turn will be next; that if a city so well fortified by nature and art,
so well supplied with men and money, that had held out the siege so
long, should at last surrender; what should they, the neighbouring
isles, do, if attacked, who were so inferior to it? and besides, they
might have much of their goods in it, in which they traded with the
inhabitants of it, trusting to its great strength, and which would now
give them a sensible concern. The Targum renders it, the suburbs; and
anther Jewish (n) writer, the villages; those that were near to Tyre:

when the wounded cry, when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee?
upon the enemy's entrance, putting to the sword all they meet with; when
those that are wounded shall cry, either to have their lives spared, or
through the pain and distress occasioned by their wounds.

[Ezekiel 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 26:16</span></span>

Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones,....
The kings of the islands of the sea shall lay aside their regalia, all
their royal grandeur, and the ensigns of it; leave their thrones of
state, and sit in an humble posture:

and lay away their robes, and put off their broidered garments; their
royal robes and raiment of needlework curiously embroidered, and richly
wrought, such as princes wear; so did the king of Nineveh in token of
humiliation, [Jon 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#006.md). The Septuagint
and Arabic versions understand the first clause of their taking their
mitres, or diadems, from their heads:

they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall tremble from
head to foot in every joint, as if they were covered with it, as with a
garment; or, being clothed with sackcloth, as mourners used to be, shall
shake and tremble, being used to other and better clothing:

they shall sit upon the ground; as Job did, and his friends, with dust
and ashes on their heads, as persons in distress were wont to do, [Job
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#008.md),

and shall tremble at every moment; continually, every hour, minute, and
moment of the day: or, "at the breaches" (o); so Jarchi; that is, those
made upon Tyre; fearing lest the same should be made upon them; so the
Targum, "because of their breaches"; or at the ruin and destruction they
fear will be their case also:

and be astonished at thee; that a city so wealthy and mighty should be
brought so low; see [Rev 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#009.md).

And they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say unto thee,....
The following mournful song:

how art thou destroyed that wast inhabited of seafaring men; or, "of the
seas": by men who used the seas, and traded by sea to different parts of
the world; and was frequented by persons that came by sea thither, by
the great ocean, by the Red sea, the Mediterranean sea, and others; or,
which was surrounded by the sea. So the Targum,

"that dwellest in the midst of the sea:''

"the renowned city, which wast strong in the sea"; fortified by the sea,
and against it; strong in shipping and naval stores; so as to be
formidable to others, and mistress of the sea. The Targum is,

"which dwell in the strength of the sea;''

and had the strength and riches of it brought unto it; and so was famous
all the world over for its commerce, wealth, and power; but now ruined
and undone:

she and her inhabitants, which cause their terror to be on all that
haunt it! the sea; on all that used the seas; or on all the inhabitants
of the islands of the sea; who all stood in fear of Tyre and her
inhabitants, and were obliged to strike their sails to their ships.

[Ezekiel 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 26:18</span></span>

Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall,.... The isles near
unto it, the isles of the Mediterranean sea; the inhabitants of them,
the merchants who from thence traded with Tyre, the seafaring men of
those places; partly on account of losses sustained hereby, and partly
through fear of the same calamities coming upon themselves; see [Rev
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#011.md), yea, the isles that are in the
sea shall be troubled at thy departure; as at the cry of the wounded,
and the number of the slain; so on account of those that should be
carried away captive by the Babylonians; as well as at the departure of
those that should be obliged to fly to other colonies, [Isa
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#006.md), so that, upon one account or
another, it shall be entirely stripped of its inhabitants.

[Ezekiel 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 26:19</span></span>

For thus saith the Lord God,.... Both to the terror of Tyre, and for the
comfort of his people:

when I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not
inhabited; whose trade is ruined, whose inhabitants are destroyed, and
whose walls are broken down, and become a mere waste and desert; where
no person or anything of value are to be seen:

when I shall bring up the deep upon thee, and the great waters shall
cover thee: the waters of the sea shall rush in and overflow the city,
the walls of it being broken down; just as the old world, and the cities
of it, were overflowed with the deluge, to which the allusion may be;
whether this was literally accomplished on Tyre is not certain; perhaps
it is to be taken in a figurative sense, and to be understood of the
large army of the Chaldeans that should come up against it, and
overpower it. So the Targum,

"when I shall bring up against them an army of people, who are many as
the waters of the deep, and many people shall cover thee; see [Rev

When I shall bring thee down with them that descend into the pit,....
The grave, and make thee like to them:

with the people of old time; either the people of the old world, or,
however, who have been dead long ago:

and shall set thee in the low parts of the earth; where the dead are
laid:

in places desolate of old: long ago unfrequented by men; as such places
be as are for the burial of the dead:

with them that go down to the pit, that thou be not inhabited; all the
inhabitants being free among the dead; a heap of words made use of to
express the same thing, for the confirmation of it; namely, that the
condition of Tyre should be like that of dead men, who have been of old
dead, and are remembered no more. Jarchi interprets the "pit", of hell;
as if this respected their everlasting perdition, as well as temporal
ruin; it may be applied to the beast which goeth into perdition, [Rev
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#008.md),

and I shall set glory in the land of the living; in the land of Israel;
so the Targum; and it is interpreted by the Jewish expositors and others
the same way; and which may be called "the land of the living"; because
the living God was worshipped in it; living men in a spiritual sense
dwelt there, who offered up living sacrifices unto God, and who had the
promise and pledge of eternal life; and which was the "glory" of all
lands, as it is sometimes called, where the same word is used as here,
[Eze 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#006.md), which had its
accomplishment in some respects at the Jews' return from Babylon; but,
as Tyre here is a type of antichrist, it may be observed, that, at the
time of his fall and destruction, God will put a glory upon his church
and people, upon which there shall be a defence; see [Isa
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005.md). This is interpreted by the
Talmudists (p) of the resurrection of the dead, when they that die in
the land of Israel shall live.

I will make thee a terror,.... To all the isles round about, who shall
shake and tremble at the ruin of Tyre, as before observed; or to
herself, being brought into a most terrible and distressed condition:

and thou shall be no more: in the same place and situation, in the same
happy state and condition:

though thou be sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again, saith
the Lord God: this is true of the antitype, Babylon, or antichrist, [Rev
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#021.md).
