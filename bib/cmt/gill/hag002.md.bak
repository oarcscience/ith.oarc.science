INTRODUCTION TO HAGGAI 2

This chapter contains three sermons or prophecies, delivered by the
prophet to the people of the Jews. The design of the first is to
encourage them to go on with the building of the temple, though it might
seem to come greatly short of the former temple, as to its outward form
and splendour. The time of the prophecy, [Hag
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#001.md) an order to deliver it to the
governor, high priest, and all the people, [Hag
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#002.md). A question is put concerning the
difference between this temple and the former; between which it is
suggested there was no comparison; which is assented to by silence, [Hag
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#003.md) nevertheless, the prince, priest,
and people, are exhorted to go on strenuously in the work of building;
encouraged with a promise of the presence of the Lord of hosts, and of
his Word, in whom he covenanted with them at their coming out of Egypt,
and of the blessed Spirit, and his continuance with them, [Hag
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#004.md) and, the more to remove their
fears and faintings, it is declared that in a very short time a most
wonderful thing should be done in the world, which would affect all the
nations of the earth; for that illustrious Person would come, whom all
nations do or should desire; and, not only come into the world, but into
that temple they were building, and give it a greater glory than the
former; yea, a greater glory than if all the gold and silver in the
world were laid out upon it, or brought into it; which being all the
Lord's, could have been easily done by him; but he would give in it
something infinitely greater than that, even the Prince of peace, with
all the blessings of it, [Hag 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#006.md) then
follows the second sermon or prophecy, the time of which is observed,
[Hag 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#010.md) and it is introduced with
some questions concerning ceremonial uncleanness, by an unclean person's
touching holy flesh with the skirt of his garment; and other things,
which is confirmed by the answer of the priests, [Hag
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#011.md) the application of which is made
to the people of the Jews, who were alike unclean; they, their works,
and their sacrifices, [Hag 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#014.md) and
these are directed to consider, that, during the time they had neglected
to build the temple, they were attended with scarcity of provisions;
their fields and vineyards being blasted with mildew or destroyed by
hail, and their labours proved unsuccessful, [Hag
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#015.md) but now, since they had begun the
work of building, it is promised they should be blessed with everything,
though they had nothing in store, and everything was unpromising to
them; which is designed to encourage them to go on cheerfully in their
begun work, [Hag 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#018.md) and the chapter
is concluded with the last discourse or prophecy, the date of which is
given, [Hag 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#020.md) an instruction to
deliver it to Zerubbabel, [Hag 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#021.md)
foretelling the destruction of the kingdoms of the heathen; and the
setting up of the kingdom of the Messiah, of whom Zerubbabel was a type,
precious and honourable in the sight of God, [Hag
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#022.md).

[Haggai 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hag 2:1</span></span>

In the seventh month,.... The month Tisri, which answers to part of
September and part of October:

in the one and twentieth day of the month; being a month, wanting three
days, from the time the Jews came and worked in the house of the Lord,
[Hag 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#014.md) it was toward the close of
the feast of tabernacles: see [Lev
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#034.md),

came the word of the Lord by the Prophet Haggai; the word of prophecy,
as the Targum: this was from the Lord, not from the prophet himself; he
was only the messenger sent with it to deliver it:

saying; to him the prophet, giving him orders as follow:

[Haggai 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hag 2:2</span></span>

Speak now to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah,.... Of
whom, his descent and dignity; see Gill on [Hag
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001.md). The Septuagint version wrongly
renders it "of the tribe of Judah"; in which it is followed by the
Arabic version; for, though he was of the tribe of Judah, this does not
sufficiently distinguish him; nor does it answer to the word here used,
which is expressive of his office and dignity. The Vulgate Latin
version, Luther, and Castalio, omit the particle rendered "now", which
is very emphatic. The prophet is ordered to go and say what he is bid,
directly, immediately, at once, without any delay; the very day before
mentioned, yea, at that very instant or moment, the people being now at
work, under the eye of their governor; in order to remove an offence,
which might discourage them in their work, taken from the meanness of
the building, in comparison of the former temple:

and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to the residue
of the people; these, besides the two former, even the whole body of the
people, the remnant that were come out of the captivity of Babylon:

saying; to the above persons, as follows:

[Haggai 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hag 2:3</span></span>

Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory?.... Not
taken away by death, yet alive, and dwelling among them; and who lived
before the destruction of the first temple, built by Solomon; and has
seen it in all its magnificence; its grand and noble structure; its
stately pillars; its carved work, and decorations of gold. This shows
that it was not in the times of Darius Nothus, but of Darius Hystaspis,
that Haggai prophesied: those who go the former way make these men to
have lived near two hundred years at least, which was greatly beyond the
common time of man's life in that age; or consider these words as a mere
supposition, that, if there were or had been such persons then living,
this building, in comparison of the former, must have appeared mean and
contemptible unto them: but the words manifestly imply that there were
persons among them then living, who had seen Solomon's temple in all its
glory; and who are particularly and personally addressed in the
following clauses; and of whom there might be several at this time,
going the latter way; for the seventy years' captivity are to be
reckoned from the fourth year of Jehoiakim, in which the captivity
began, and which was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar, [Jer
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#001.md) but it was not until the
nineteenth year of his reign that the temple, was burnt by him, [Jer
52:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#012.md) and the time of Haggai's
prophesying being about seventeen or eighteen years after the
proclamation of Cyrus, when the seventy years' captivity ended; this
shows that it was scarcely seventy years from the time the temple was
destroyed; and therefore it may be reasonably supposed there were
several ancient persons living that could remember to have seen it; and
it is certain that there were a great number of such living that
returned from Babylon, who wept when they saw the foundation of the
second temple laid, which was but fifteen years before this, [Ezr
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#012.md) some of whom, in all probability,
were now alive, yea, it is certain there were, to whom the following
questions were put:

and how do ye see it now? is not this that is building very different
from that? does it promise anything like it? what ideas have you of it?
can you conceive in your minds that it will ever rise up to such
grandeur and stateliness as the former? what is your judgment, and what
your sentiments concerning it? can you think of it with equal delight
and pleasure as of the former?

is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing? do not you think
that it is not to be mentioned, or once named, in comparison of the
former temple? or that a man had as good say nothing at all, as to
attempt a comparison of them? or that this building and nothing are
alike? and that the one is a nonentity, as well as the other,
comparatively speaking, when set in competition with the first temple?
and are not you of opinion that the people had as good do nothing, and
that in effect they are doing nothing, and all their labour lost, who
are working in this house? no answer is returned, nor any waited for:
but it is as if the Lord had said, I, who am the omniscient God, the
discerner of the thoughts of men, know that these are your sentiments,
and these the reasonings of your minds; and but now lest discovering
these thoughts of theirs, and speaking out their minds freely as they
might, which would tend to discourage the governors and the people in
carrying on the work they had engaged in; the Lord by the prophet says
to them, as follows:

[Haggai 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hag 2:4</span></span>

Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the Lord,.... Take heart, be of
good courage, do not be dismayed at these things; though, the building
may be contemptible in the eyes of some, nevertheless go on with it
manfully and vigorously; let, none despise the day of small things; for
from these low beginnings great things will arise, and glorious things
will follow, as hereafter predicted; see [Zac
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#009.md) attend this, work diligently,
desist not from it, continue to preside over it, and encourage the
people in it; let not thine heart faint, or thine hands be slack; act
the part of man, of a good man, and of a governor:

and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech the high priest; do not be
disheartened at what the ancients think and say concerning this temple,
in which thou art to officiate as a high priest; and as a type of him
who shall come into this house, and so give it a glory the former never
had; continue to give the necessary instructions to the builders, that
everything may be done in proper order, and to answer their end and use
in the service of the priesthood; faint not, nor be discouraged, but act
according to thy character, and show thyself worthy of the office with
which thou art invested; consider in whose name thou actest?, whose
priest thou art, and in whose service thou art employed:

and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the Lord; let not your
hearts sink, or spirits fail, at hearing what the more ancient among you
say of the difference between this and the former building, which your
eyes never saw; do not desist from your work on this account, but go on
with it; consider what God has done for you, in bringing you out of
captivity, and into your own land, and to the enjoyment of your civil
privileges; consider the obligations you lie under to build a house for
God; that this is not only a piece of gratitude, and shows a sense of
mercies received; but that it is for the glory of God, for your
spiritual profit and advantage, and for the use and good of future
posterity; quit yourselves therefore like men, and be strong; see [Jos
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#006.md),

and work; that is, continue working, for they were at work; but there
was danger of their leaving off working, being discouraged at what the
ancient people said; and therefore they are exhorted to go on in their
work, and go through it, and finish it; for so the word here used
signifies, "and do" (e); that is, the work thoroughly and effectually;
or, as others render it, "and perfect" (f) the work begun, and leave it
not unfinished. Aben Ezra, Jarchi, Kimchi, and Ben Melech, connect this
word with the beginning of the following verse, thus, "and do the word,
or thing, which I covenanted with you", &c. [Hag
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#005.md); that is, observe the law, and do
the commandment then given; but very wrongly: nor is it only to be
considered as directed to the people, but to the prince and priest also;
for they had all work to do in the house of the Lord, as all ranks and
degrees of men now have in the church of Christ; of which that house was
typical: the prince or civil magistrate, not to prescribe laws and rules
to be observed in it, which only belongs to Christ, who is the sole
Head, King, and Lawgiver; but to attend the service of it, to protect
and defend it, to promote the interest of it, and distribute cheerfully
to the maintenance of its ministers, and to the necessities of the poor
saints. Priests or ministers of the word are to work; they are to labour
in the word and doctrine; in preaching the Gospel; administering
ordinances; governing the church; comforting saints; reproving vice, and
refuting error: deacons are to do their work, in taking care of the
poor, and minding the secular affairs of the church: and all private
Christians are to work, to labour in prayer for the good of it; to hear
the word, attend on all ordinances, and hold fast the profession of
their faith; all which is to be done in the strength and grace of
Christ, without dependence on it, or seeking justification and salvation
by it; encouraged, as the Jews are here, with the promise of the divine
Presence:

for I am with you, saith the Lord of hosts; to help in every service,
and to protect from all enemies; and this makes the work and service of
the Lord's house pleasant and delightful, and secures from all doubts
and fears, faintings and misgivings of heart. This is to be understood
of God the Father, the Lord of armies above and below; and if he is for
and with his people, they have nothing to fear from those that are
against them; or to be discouraged in his service. The Targum wrongly
interprets this of the Word of the Lord, since he is meant in the next
verse [Hag 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#005.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hag 2:5</span></span>

According to the Word that I covenanted with you, when ye came out of
Egypt,.... Or rather, "with the Word, in or with whom I covenanted" (g),
&c. as some render it; that is, Christ, the essential Word, who was
promised to the people of Israel at that time, [Deu
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015.md) and in whom all the promises
are, and the covenant of grace itself; and which covenant was indeed
made with him from eternity, but was made manifest, or more clearly
manifest, to the Jewish ancestors, when they came out of Egypt: now it
is here promised, for the encouragement of the Jews to go in the work of
the Lord in building the temple, that this divine Word should be with
them also, to counsel, assist, strengthen, and protect them; even he who
went before their fathers in the wilderness in a pillar of cloud by day,
and of fire by night; the Angel of God's presence, that redeemed, saved,
and carried them all the days of old; the Word that was in the beginning
with God, and was God; and by whom all things were created at first; and
who would, as since he has, become flesh, and dwell among them, and
appear in this very temple they were now building; and who will be with
all his churches, ministers, and people, unto the end of the world:

so my Spirit remaineth among you: or rather, "and", or "also, my Spirit
standeth", continueth "in the midst of you" (h); not only Jehovah the
Father, and his divine Logos or Word, were with them; but his Spirit
also, his Holy Spirit, the third Person in the Trinity, of which these
words are a proof; the same Spirit which was in Moses and others in his
time, for the building of the tabernacle, is now promised unto, and
should continue with, the builders of this temple; as a Spirit of wisdom
and counsel to direct them, and as a Spirit of might and power to
strengthen and assist them: and so he is, and will be, in the churches
of Christ, and in the midst of his people, to assist the ministers of
the word in preaching, the people in hearing, praying, and praising; to
carry on his own work in them; to be the Comforter of them, and the
seal, earnest, and pledge of their future glory; nor does he, nor ever
will he, depart from them; see [Isa
59:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#021.md),

fear ye not: succeeding in the work, and finishing it; nor be dismayed
at what the ancient people had said; nor be afraid of enemies, who did
all they could to hinder and discourage them from going on with their
work; and indeed there is no reason to fear, let the service be what it
will the Lord employs his people in; if he, Father, Son, and Spirit, are
with them; see [Isa 41:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#010.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hag 2:6</span></span>

For thus saith the Lord of hosts;.... For the further encouragement of
the builders of the temple, they are told, from the Lord of hosts, that
in a little time, when such circumstances should meet as are here
pointed at, the Messiah should come, and appear in this house, and give
it a greater glory than ever Solomon's temple had; for that this passage
is to be understood of the Messiah and his times is clear from the
apostle's application of it, [Heb
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#025.md) and even the ancient Jews
themselves understood it of the Messiah, particularly R. Aquiba (i), who
lived in the times of Bar Cozbi, the false Messiah; though the more
modern ones, perceiving how they are embarrassed with it; to support
their hypothesis, shift it off from him:

Yet once, it is a little while: or, "once more", as the apostle in the
above place quotes it; which suggests that the Lord had before done
something of the kind, that follows, shaking the heavens, &c. as at the
giving of the law on Mount Sinai; and would do the same again, and more
abundantly in the times of the Gospel, or of the Messiah. Jarchi
interprets this of one trouble by the Grecian monarchy after the
Persian, which would not last long: his note is,

"yet once, &c. after that this kingdom of Persia that rules over you is
ended, yet one shall rise up to rule over you, to distress you, the
kingdom of Greece; but its government shall be but a little time;''

and not very foreign from this sense does Bishop Chandler (k) render the
words, "after one kingdom (the Grecian) it is a little while; (or after
that) I will shake all the heavens", &c.; and though it was five hundred
years from this prophecy to the incarnation of Christ: yet this was but
a little while with God, with whom a thousand years are as one day; and
indeed with men it was but a short time, when compared with the first
promise of his coming at the beginning of the world; or with the shaking
of the earth at the giving of the law, soon after Israel came out of
Egypt:

and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry
land; which either intends the changes and revolutions made in the
several kingdoms and nations of the world, between this prophecy and the
coming of Christ, and which soon began to take place; for the Persian
monarchy, now flourishing, was quickly shook and subdued by the
Grecians; and in a little time the Grecian monarchy was destroyed by the
Romans; and what changes they made in each of the nations of the world
is well known: or else this designs the wonderful things that were done
in the heavens, earth, and sea, at the birth of Christ, during his life,
and at his death: at his birth a new star appeared in the heavens, which
brought the wise men from the east to visit him; the angels of heaven
descended, and sung Glory to God in the highest; Herod and all the
inhabitants of Jerusalem were shaken, moved, and troubled at the tidings
of his birth; yea, people in all parts of Judea were in motion to be
taxed in their respective cities at this time: stormy winds were raised,
which agitated the waters of the sea in his lifetime; on which he
walked, and which he rebuked; and this showed him to be the mighty God:
at his death the heavens were darkened, the earth quaked, and rocks were
rent asunder: if any particular earthquake about this time should be
thought to be intended, the most terrible one was that which happened A.
D. 17, when Coelius Rufus and Pomponius Flaccus were consuls, which
destroyed twelve cities of Asia (l); and these being near the sea,
caused a motion there also. The apostle applies these words to the
change made in the worship of God by the coming of Christ, when the
carnal ordinances of the law were removed, and evangelical ordinances
instituted, which shall remain until his second coming, [Heb
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#026.md).

[Haggai 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hag 2:7</span></span>

And I will shake all nations,.... By changing their governors, and forms
of government; which was done by the Romans, when subdued by them; and
by bringing in wars among them, which produced those changes; and by
civil wars among the Romans themselves, in the several nations that
belonged to them, which were notorious a little before the coming of
Christ: or else this was to be done, and was done, by the preaching of
the Gospel, both in Judea, and in the Gentile world, when all the
inhabitants thereof were shaken by it, in one sense or another; some had
their hearts and consciences shaken by the Spirit and grace of God
through it, and were brought to embrace it, and profess it; yea, were
brought to Christ, to yield obedience to him, his truths and ordinances;
and others were moved with envy, wrath, and indignation at it, and rose
up to oppose it, and stop the progress of it:

and the desire of all nations shall come; not the desirable things of
all nations, or them with them, as their gold and silver; and which is
the sense of Jarchi, Kimchi, and Aben Ezra; but this is contrary to the
syntax of the words, to the context, [Hag
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#008.md), and to facts; and, if true, would
not have given this temple a greater glory than Solomon's: nor the elect
of God, as others, brought in through the preaching of the Gospel; who
are indeed the desire of God, he takes pleasure in them; and of Christ,
whose delights have been always in them; and of the blessed Spirit,
whose love to them, and esteem of them, are very manifest; and with the
saints they are the excellent in the earth, in whom is all their
delight: yet not they, but one far more glorious and excellent, is
intended, even the Messiah, in whom all nations of the earth were to be
blessed; and who, so far as he was known by good men or proselytes among
the Gentiles, was desired by them, as by Job, and others; and who, when
he came, brought all good things with him; and has all blessings in him,
that may make him desirable to men, being what they want; and though he
is not in fact desired by all, yet of right he should be, and to all
sensible sinners he is; even above all persons and things in the whole
world; on account of his excellencies and glories; his mediatorial
qualifications; his names, offices, and relations; the blessings of
grace in him; the works done by him; his truths and ordinances, people,
ways, and worship: and when it is said, he "shall come", the meaning is,
not only into the world by assumption of nature, to obtain redemption
for his people; but into this temple now building, in that nature
assumed; where he appeared at the presentation of him by his parents;
and at the passover, when twelve years of age; and when he drove out the
buyers and sellers from it; and when he often taught in it. The word
"come" is in the plural number; and may denote his frequent coming
thither, as well as in different respects; his personal coming; his
spiritual coming; his coming to take vengeance on the Jews; and his last
coming, of which some understand the words particularly:

and I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord of hosts; alluding
to the glory which filled the tabernacle of Moses, and the temple of
Solomon, [Exo 40:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#035.md) but that was but a
shadowy glory, this a real one; here Christ appeared in person, who is
the brightness of his Father's glory; here his glorious doctrines were
taught, and glorious miracles wrought; and the Spirit of glory rested on
the disciples, in his gifts and grace bestowed upon them in an
extraordinary manner, on the day of Pentecost.

[Haggai 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hag 2:8</span></span>

The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the Lord of hosts. This
seems designed to anticipate an objection taken from the gold and
silver, with which the first temple was either decorated, or were in
gifts dedicated to it; and which, it might easily be foreseen, would be
wanting in the second temple; and in answer to which the Lord observes,
that all the gold and silver in the world were his, were made by him,
and were at his dispose; and therefore whatever were bestowed upon the
former temple was only giving him his own; what he had a prior right to,
and was no accession of riches or honour to him; and so it would be the
same, let what would be expended on this; and therefore it was an
article very inconsiderable, and of little significance; nor did he
regard, or was he delighted with anything of this kind; and, was he so
disposed, he could easily command all the gold and silver in the world
together, and bring it into this house, to enrich and adorn it, without
doing any injury to any person; but these were things he delighted not
in; and, besides, he had a far greater glory in view to put upon this
house, as follows:

[Haggai 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hag 2:9</span></span>

The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former,
saith the Lord of hosts,.... The "former", or first house, was the
temple built by Solomon, which was a very glorious one, if we consider
the vast treasure of riches laid up by David, and given to Solomon for
the building of it; the great number of workmen employed in it; the
stateliness of the fabric, the like to which was never seen, the model
being drawn by the Lord himself; the decoration of it; the vessels in
it; and, above all, the glory of the Lord that filled it, and continued
in it; and yet this "latter" or second house exceeded it. It must be a
glory very great indeed to exceed this! The Jews (m) themselves own
there were several things wanting in the latter which were in the
former, as the "ark", the "Urim" and "Thummim", the "fire" from heaven,
the "Shechinah" (or, as in some books, the anointing oil, and, in
others, the cherubim), and the "Holy Ghost": by one of their writers
(n), they are reckoned in this order, the ark, the mercy seat, and
cherubim, one; the Shechinah or divine Majesty, the second; the Holy
Ghost, which is prophecy, the third; Urim and Thummim the fourth: and
the fire from heaven the fifth: what could there be in it to compensate
the want of these, and put it upon a level, and even to cause it to
excel the temple of Solomon? the excelling glory did not lie in the
fabric; when the foundation of it was laid, the old men wept, because it
came so short of the other; and, as the building rose, it was in their
eyes as nothing; who were better judges than later Jews, who magnify the
building of the second temple; depending upon the authority of Josephus
ben Gorion, who is not to be trusted: nor did it lie in the duration of
it, it continuing ten years longer, they say (o), than the former;
which, if true, could not answer to the deficiencies before mentioned;
or be an encouragement to the builders to go on in their work: nor in
the riches brought into it by the Gentiles in the times of the
Maccabees, which was very inconsiderable; and could never make it equal
to Solomon's temple, and much less preferable to it; nor by Alexander
the great honouring it with his presence (p); for surely Solomon was
greater than he. It remains, that what gave it the greater glory was the
personal presence of the Messiah in it, his doctrines, and his miracles:

and, or "for",

in this place will I give peace, saith the Lord of hosts; not temporal
peace, for there was little of that during the second temple; witness
the times of the Maccabees, and the wars with the Romans; but spiritual
peace, through the blood and righteousness of Christ; peace with God;
reconciliation for sin, through the sacrifice of the Son of God, in whom
he is well pleased; yea, Christ himself may be meant, the Prince of
peace, the Man the peace, who is our peace, [Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md) the author of peace between God
and men, between Jew and Gentile; the giver of spiritual and eternal
peace: him the Lord gave, "put", and set in this place, the temple, as
before observed; and where the Gospel of peace was preached, and from
whence it went forth into all the world. The Arabic version adds,

"peace of soul, I say, to be possessed by everyone that labours to raise
up this temple.''

[Haggai 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hag 2:10</span></span>

In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month,.... The month Chisleu,
which answers to part of November, and part of December: this was two
months and three days after the former discourse or prophecy, and just
three months from the time the Jews began to work in the house of the
Lord, [Hag 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#014.md)

in the second year of Darius; the same year that all the former
discourses and prophecies were delivered in:

came the word of the Lord by Haggai the prophet; for what he delivered
was not his own, but from the Lord; he was only his minister and
messenger. The Vulgate Latin version, and so Munster, render it, "unto
Haggai the prophet"; and indeed what is said following seems to be
directed to him, and he is the only person that put the questions
directed to:

saying; as follows:

[Haggai 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hag 2:11</span></span>

Thus saith the Lord of hosts,.... To Haggai the prophet:

ask now the priests concerning the law; whose business it was to
understand it, and teach it, and to answer questions, and resolve doubts
concerning it; not of their own heads, and according to their fancies,
will, and pleasure; but according to the rules and instructions given in
the word of God: and as this was their office, they were the proper
persons to apply to; and Haggai, though a prophet, is sent to the
priests to propose questions to them; though it may be not so much for
his own information, as for the conviction of the priests of their
impurity, out of their own mouths, and of the people by them:

saying; putting the following questions to them.

[Haggai 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hag 2:12</span></span>

If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment,.... Or, "carry" it
(q); from one place to another in his pockets or bags, which were in the
skirts of his garments. This is to be understood of the flesh of
creatures offered in sacrifice, which were sanctified or separated for
holy use; part of which belonged to the priests, who might carry it in
their pockets to the proper place of eating it:

and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any
meat: which were not holy, and not separated for holy use, but were
common meats and drinks: now the question upon this is,

shall it be holy? that is, if either of those common things were touched
by the skirt, in the pockets of which the holy flesh were carried,
whether they were made holy by such a touch, and no more remained common
or profane?

and the priests answered and said, No; they were not sanctified; for
though the garment itself was sanctified thereby, and might not be
employed in common use till washed, [Lev
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#027.md) yet a garment so touched could
not convey holiness to whatsoever that touched, or that touched it.

\(q\) "portaverit", Munster; "portet", Varenius, Reinbeck.

[Haggai 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hag 2:13</span></span>

Then said Haggai,.... To the priests; having nothing to object to their
answer; but being satisfied with it, he puts another question:

if one that is unclean by a dead body; by the touch of it, [Num
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#011.md),

touch any of these, shall it be unclean? that is, if such an impure
person, who was so in a ceremonial sense, should touch any of the above
things, bread, pottage, wine, or oil, or any meat, would not they become
unclean thereby, and so not fit for use?

and the priests answered and said, it shall be unclean; which was
rightly answered; for whatsoever such an unclean person touched was
unclean, according to the law, [Lev
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#022.md). Pollution is more easily and
more extensively conveyed than holiness.

[Haggai 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hag 2:14</span></span>

Then answered Haggai, and said,.... To the priests, and before the
people; and made an application of these things to them, which was the
thing in view in putting the questions:

So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith the Lord; not
only those people that were present and at work at the temple, but those
that were absent, even the whole body of the people; who, though they
were pure in their own eyes, yet were not so before the Lord; who knew
their hearts, and the spring of all their actions; what were their ends
and views in all they did: as a garment carrying in it holy flesh could
not sanctify other things touched by it that were common and profane,
but left them as they were; so their ritual devotions, and externally
holy actions, did not and could not sanctify their impure hearts, but
left them as unclean as before; nor did they sanctify their common
mercies, their bread, pottage, wine, and oil: and, on the other hand, as
an impure person made everything impure he touched; so they, being
impure in heart, all their actions, even their religious ones, were
impure also, as follows:

and so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is
unclean; pointing at the altar, which they had built, and offered
sacrifice on ever since they came out of Babylon, though the temple was
not yet built, [Ezr 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#003.md) but all their
outward religious services, and all the sacrifices they offered up, were
in the Lord's account impure and abominable, as well as themselves;
coming from an unsanctified heart, and offered up with unclean hands,
and without repentance towards God, and faith in Christ; and living in
other respects in disobedience to God, and especially while they
neglected the building of the temple; satisfying themselves with
offering sacrifices on the altar, when the house of God lay desolate;
which is the principal thing respected, as appears by what follows.

[Haggai 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">hag 2:15</span></span>

And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward,.... This being
their case, and they so polluted with sin, particularly through their
neglect of building the temple; they are most earnestly and
importunately entreated to "lay" it "to their hearts", to ponder it in
their minds, and thoroughly consider how it had fared with them from
this twenty fourth day of the ninth month, in which the prophet was sent
unto them to encourage them in their work, and upwards or backwards, for
some years past: even

from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the Lord: the
foundation of the temple was laid quickly after the Jews returned from
Babylon, upon the proclamation of Cyrus, [Ezr
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#010.md) but, through difficulties and
discouragements they met with, they desisted from the work, and went no
further; a stone was not laid upon it; or, as the Targum, a row, or
course upon course, until this time: and now all the intermediate space
of time between the first laying the foundation of the temple, and their
present going to work upon it, the prophet would have them take
particular notice of; how it had been with them, as to their outward
circumstances; whereby it would appear, they had sinned, and the Lord
had been offended with them.

[Haggai 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">hag 2:16</span></span>

Since those days were,.... From the time the foundation of the temple
was laid, unto the time they began to work again, which was a space of
about fifteen or sixteen years:

when one came to an heap of twenty measures, there were but ten; when
the husbandman having gathered in his corn, and who was generally a good
judge of what it would yield, came to a heap of it on his corn floor,
either of sheaves not threshed, or grain not winnowed, and expected it
would have produced at least twenty measures, seahs, or bushels;
afterward it was threshed and winnowed, to his great disappointment he
had but ten out of it; there were so much straw and chaff, and so little
grain; or when he came to a heap of grain, wheat, or barley, in his
granary, where he thought he should have twenty bushels of it; but when
he had measured it, proved but ten; being either stolen by thieves, or
eaten by vermin; rather the latter:

when one came to the wine vat for to draw out fifty vessels out of the
press, there were but twenty; by the quantity of grapes which he put
into the press to tread and squeeze, he expected to have had fifty
measures, or baths, or hogsheads of wine; but, instead of that, had but
twenty; the bunches were so thin, or the berries so bad: there was a
greater decrease and deficiency in the wine than in the grain.

[Haggai 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">hag 2:17</span></span>

I smote you with blasting,.... That is, their fields and vineyards, with
burning winds, which consumed them; with blights by east winds: this
shows the reason of their disappointment, and that it was from the Lord,
and for their sins, by way of chastisement and correction:

and with mildew; a kind of clammy dew, which corrupts and destroys the
fruits of the earth; and is a kind of jaundice to them, as the word
signifies; see [Amo 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#009.md),

and with hail; which battered down the corn and the vines, and broke
them to pieces; see [Exo 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#025.md),

in all the labours of your hands; in the corn they sowed, and in the
vines they planted:

yet ye turned not to me, saith the Lord; did not consider their evil
ways as the cause of all this; nor repent of them, and turn from them to
the Lord; to his worship, as the Targum; or to the building of his
house, the thing chiefly complained of. Afflictions, unless sanctified,
have no effect upon men to turn them from their sins to the Lord.

[Haggai 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">hag 2:18</span></span>

Consider now from this day and upward,.... Or forward; for time to come,
as the Vulgate Latin version:

from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month; before observed,
[Hag 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#010.md),

even from the day that the foundation of the Lord's temple was laid,
consider it; not from the time it was first laid after their return upon
the proclamation of Cyrus, but from the time they began to clear that
foundation, and to build upon it; and which having lain so long
neglected, the renewal of it is represented as a fresh laying of it: now
the prophet, as he had directed them to consider what adversity and
calamities had attended them from the time of their neglect unto this
time; so he would have them particularly observe what blessings they
would enjoy from henceforward; by which it would appear how pleasing it
was to the Lord that they had begun and were going on with the building.

[Haggai 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">hag 2:19</span></span>

Is the seed yet in the barn?.... The seed for sowing the land, in order
for the next harvest: this is by some answered in the affirmative, it
was in the barn, it was not yet sown; this being the ninth month, the
month Chisleu, which answers to part of our November; rather it should
be in the negative, no, it was just sown; and therefore no conjecture
could be made, whether it would be a good harvest, or not; yet the
prophet, in the name of the Lord, promises them a good one so long
before hand: for the month Chisleu, which was the ninth month, was the
last for sowing, and even the first half of that; for so say (r) the
Jews,

"half Tisri, all Marchesvan, and half Chisleu, is seed time;''

so that this being that month, seed time must have been just over; and
the sense, is there any seed in the barn? no, it is sown; and so, is
there any remaining in the granary for the support of families until the
next harvest? they knew there were none, or very little: and yet the
Lord promises to bless them, so that they should have enough:

yea, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the
olive tree, hath not brought forth; their various fruits; this not being
the time of their bearing fruit, for it was winter time; and it could
not be said what they would bring forth in their season so long before
hand; yet it is suggested by the prophet that they would be very
fruitful; which were the principal fruit trees the land of Israel
abounded with, [Deu 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#008.md) and on which
their comfortable subsistence depended. Kimchi observes, that it may be
wondered at that the olive tree should be mentioned, because the time of
its bearing fruit were the months of Marchesvan and Chisleu; but perhaps
the time of its bearing fruit was delayed (as he says) because of the
curse upon it:

from this day will I bless you; with plenty of all good things, in their
fields and gardens, in their vineyards and olive yards; so that a
difference between former and present times, and those to come, would
easily be discerned, and the reasons of it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">hag 2:20</span></span>

And again the word of the Lord came unto Haggai,.... Or a "second" (s)
time, even on the same day as the former:

in the four and twentieth day of the month; of the ninth month Chisleu,
[Hag 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#010.md),

saying; as follows:

[Haggai 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">hag 2:21</span></span>

Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah,.... The former discourse or
prophecy chiefly related to the people, for their encouragement in
building; this is directed to the prince over them, to support him under
all the changes and revolutions made in the world; that he should be
regarded by the Lord in a very tender manner, and his government
continued, as a type of Christ and his kingdom:

saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth; make great commotions,
changes, and revolutions in the world, by wars, and otherwise: the
Persian kingdom being subdued by the Grecian; the Grecian by the Romans;
the Roman empire by the Goths and Vandals; and the antichristian states,
both Papal and Mahometan, by the vials of God's wrath poured out upon
them, by means of Christian princes: such revolutions are often designed
by the shaking of the heavens, especially by earthquakes in the book of
the Revelation; see [Rev 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#014.md).

[Haggai 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">hag 2:22</span></span>

And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms,.... The Persian monarchy,
which consisted of various kingdoms and nations, and was destroyed under
Darius Codomannus by Alexander the great, who fought with him three
pitched battles, and overcame him; but the thing was of the Lord,
according to his purpose and will, and by his power and providence; and
therefore the overthrow is ascribed to him. The Jews (t) say that the
Persian monarchy fell by the Grecians thirty four years after the
building of the temple; but very wrongly, it lasted longer:

and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen; the
empire of Alexander, which was a very strong one, and contained in it
many kingdoms and nations, even the whole world, at least as he thought;
and which was divided after his death into several kingdoms; the
strength of which was greatly weakened by one another, and at last
entirely destroyed by the Romans as instruments:

and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the
horses and their riders shall come down; which may refer either to the
chariots and horses, and their riders, belonging to the Grecians, and
used in their wars; or else this may describe the empire of the Romans,
which in its turn should be destroyed, famous for their triumphal
chariots:

everyone by the sword of his brother; by civil wars, which was
remarkably true of the successors of Alexander, as appears from Josephus
(u) and Justin (w): this may be applied to all the kingdoms of this
world, which will all be demolished, and be brought into subjection to
Christ, and his kingdom shall be set up in the world, the son and
antitype of Zerubbabel, of whom the following words are to be
understood; see [Dan 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044.md). Abendana
interprets it of the army of Gog and Magog, who shall fall everyone by
the sword of his brother.

[Haggai 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">hag 2:23</span></span>

In that day, saith the Lord of hosts,.... When all these kingdoms, and
their thrones and strength, are destroyed; which shows that what follows
cannot be understood literally of Zerubbabel, who lived not to see these
things done:

will I take thee, O Zerubbabel my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith
the Lord; that is, the Messiah, as is owned by Abarbinel; who says (x),

"the King Messiah shall come, who is of the seed of Zerubbabel; and he
shall be the seal of the structure, and the end of the kingdoms; as it
is said, "I will make thee as a signet, for I have chosen thee, saith
the Lord of hosts"; for this no doubt is said concerning the days of the
Messiah:''

and another Jewish writer (y), quoting the above author for the sense of
this passage, and [Eze 37:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#025.md), adds,

"for the King Messiah he will be David, and he will be Zerubbabel, that
he may be a rod going out of their stem;''

and another (z) on these words observes,

"without doubt this is said concerning the expected Messiah, who will be
of the seed of Zerubbabel; and therefore this promise was not at all
fulfilled in him; for in the time of this prophecy he was but governor
of Judah, and he never rose to greater dignity than what he then had:''

indeed these writers wrongly suppose the Messiah yet to come, and whom
they in vain expect; and apply this, as they do many other prophecies,
to the coming of Christ in the flesh, which belong to his spiritual
appearance in his churches, or to his personal coming at the last day:
however, this shows the conviction on their minds of the application of
this and such like prophecies to the Messiah, who may be called
Zerubbabel, as he is sometimes David, because he sprung from him, was of
his lineage, and because he was a type of him, in bringing the people of
the Jews out of the Babylonish captivity, in rebuilding the temple, in
the government of the people, and in being chosen of God, and precious;
as well as a servant of the Lord, as here expressed, and which is often
mentioned as a character of the Messiah, [Isa
49:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#003.md),

and will make thee as a signet; preserve, protect and defend, love,
value, and esteem, and advance to great honour and dignity, power and
authority: the signet or seal on a man's right hand, being what he
always wears, is ever in sight, and he is careful of; as well as is what
he greatly esteems, and is dear unto him, and he highly values; and by
which a prince signs his decrees and edicts; see [Isa
49:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#002.md) [Sol
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#006.md),

for I have chosen thee, saith the Lord of hosts; to be the Redeemer and
Saviour of his people; to be their King and Governor, and the Judge of
the world. Christ is peculiarly God's elect, and in whom all his people
are chosen; be is the chosen of God, and precious, [Psa
89:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#019.md). The Targum is,

"for in thee I am well pleased;''

which is said by God the Father concerning Christ more than once, [Mat
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017.md). It is a prophecy of the
exaltation of Christ after he had done his work, as the Lord's servant,
and especially in the latter day, when he shall be King over all the
earth; all which cannot be so well applied to Zerubbabel; unless with
Reinbeck we understand it of the time of his resurrection from the dead
at the last day; when great honour shall be put upon him as a faithful
servant, and great love and affection expressed to him; but that will be
no other than what will be common to all the saints and chosen of God;
Christ, in whom all prophecies terminate, and so this, is doubtless
intended.
