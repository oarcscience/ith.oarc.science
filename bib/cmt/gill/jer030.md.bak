INTRODUCTION TO JEREMIAH 30

This chapter contains a prophecy of the call and conversion of the Jews
in the latter day; which being a matter of moment and importance, and
that it might continue, and be read hereafter, it is ordered to be
written in a book, [Jer 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#001.md); the
thing itself is expressed by a return from captivity to their own land,
[Jer 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#003.md); but previous to this there
would be most dreadful times, as never were the like, [Jer
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#004.md); yet there would be a deliverance
from them, and from the yoke of the oppressor; when the Jews should
serve the Lord God, and the true Messiah, [Jer
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#008.md); of which deliverance and
salvation they are assured in the strongest terms, though all other
nations should be made an end of, among whom they were, [Jer
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#010.md); and though their ease might
seem to be desperate, [Jer 30:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#012.md);
nevertheless they should be brought into a very comfortable and happy
estate; their city rebuilt; their offspring increased; and religious
worship established; and, above all, the Messiah should be made known to
them as their King and Priest, and they appear to be the Lord's covenant
people, [Jer 30:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#018.md); and the chapter is
concluded with threatening utter destruction to the wicked, [Jer
30:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#023.md).

[Jeremiah 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 30:1</span></span>

The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord,.... The word of prophecy,
us the Targum. Some make this to be the "thirteenth" sermon of the
prophet's; it is a consolatory one, as Kimchi observes:

saying; as follows:

[Jeremiah 30:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 30:2</span></span>

Thus speaketh the Lord God of Israel,.... Who is their covenant God; has
not forgotten them; still has a regard for them; and speaks after the
following comfortable manner concerning them:

saying, write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book;
being things of consequence, that they might remain to after ages; and
be read to the use, comfort, and edification of the Lord's people, in
times to come; and be a support to their faith and hope, as well as be a
testimony of the truth and faithfulness of God. Some think this charge
refers to all the prophecies that go before, as well as follow after, to
put them all together in a book or roll, that they might be preserved;
though others think it refers only to the present prophecy; and so
Kimchi interprets it, write all the words "that I am now speaking unto
thee" (o) in a book; which should come to pass in the latter day. So
John is bid to write in a book what he saw; the things that are, and
shall be hereafter, [Rev 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#011.md).

[Jeremiah 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 30:3</span></span>

For, lo, the days come, saith the Lord,.... And they are yet to come;
the prophecy is not yet fulfilled. Kimchi says this belongs to the days
of the Messiah; but not to his first coming, or to his coming in the
flesh, which the Jews vainly expect; but to his spiritual coming in the
latter day:

that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah,

saith the Lord; which cannot be understood of their return from the
Babylonish captivity; for, as Kimchi rightly observes, only Judah and
Benjamin returned from thence; and though there were some few of the
other tribes that came with them, especially of the tribe of Levi, yet
not sufficient to answer to so great a prophecy as this, which refers to
the same time as that in [Hos 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005.md); as
appears by comparing that with [Jer
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#009.md); and when, as the Apostle Paul
says, "all Israel shall be saved", [Rom
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025.md);

and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their
fathers, and they shall possess it; the land of Canaan, given to
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and which shall be again by the Jews their
posterity; for, without that the Jews upon their call and conversion
shall return to their own land, in a literal sense, I see not how we can
understand this, and many other prophecies.

[Jeremiah 30:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 30:4</span></span>

And these are the words that the Lord spake concerning Israel,

and concerning Judah. Which follow in this chapter and the next; first
concerning Israel, the ten tribes; and then concerning the two tribes of
Judah and Benjamin, even concerning all Israel; whereas, if this
prophecy only respects the return from the captivity in Babylon, there
is very little in it which concerns the ten tribes, or but a very few of
them. The words may be rendered, "unto Israel, and unto Judah"; as being
the persons to whom they were directed, as well as were the subjects of
them.

[Jeremiah 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 30:5</span></span>

For thus saith the Lord,.... Yet what follows are the words of others;
wherefore some supply it, "for thus saith the Lord, the nations shall
say" (p); so Kimchi and Ben Melech interpret it as what the Gentiles
will say in the times of the Messiah; but it might be better supplied,
"ye shall say"; that is, Israel and Judah; to whom the words of the Lord
are spoken in [Jer 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#003.md); or else the
Lord here represents his people, saying:

we have heard a voice of trembling, ear, and not of peace; which is to
be understood, of the fear and dread injected into them by the
Babylonians when they besieged their city, and burned that, and their
temple; nor of the fear and dread which came upon the Babylonians at the
taking of their city by Cyrus, upon which followed the deliverance of
the Jews. Kimchi interprets this of something yet future, the war of Gog
and Magog, which he supposes wilt be when their Messiah comes; and
Jarchi sans it is so understood in their Midrash Agadah. This distress,
I think, refers to the slaying of the witnesses, and to that hour of
temptation which shall come upon all the earth to try the inhabitants of
it; and which will be followed with the destruction of antichrist; and
that will make way for the call and conversion of the Jews.

[Jeremiah 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 30:6</span></span>

Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child?.... Look into
the histories of former times, inquire of those most versed in them,
whether ever there was such a thing in the world as that a man should
travail with child; ask one and, another you see in distress, whether
that is their case or not, which looks so much like it; and since there
never was such an instance, nor is it possible that there should:

wherefore do I see every man with his hands his loins, as a woman in
travail; the usual posture of women in such a condition, trying hereby
to abate their pain, and ease themselves. This metaphor is made use of,
both to express the sharpness and shortness of this distress; as the
pains of a woman in travail are very sharp, yet short, and, when over,
quickly forgotten; and so it wilt be at this time; it will be a sharp
trial of the church and people of God; but it will last but for a short
time; and the joy and happy times that will follow will soon cause it to
be forgotten:

and all faces are turned into paleness? at the departure of the blood,
through fear and trembling. The Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions
render it "the yellow jaundice"; their faces were of the colour of such
persons that have that disease upon them; or, as others, the green
sickness. Some render it, "the king's evil" (q).

[Jeremiah 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 30:7</span></span>

Alas! for that day is great,.... For sorrow and distress:

so that none is like it; such were the times of Jerusalem's siege and
destruction by the Romans; and which was an emblem of those times of
trouble from antichrist in the latter day; see [Mat
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#021.md);

it is even the time of Jacob's trouble: of the church and people of God,
the true Israel of God; when Popery will be the prevailing religion in
Christendom; when the outward court shall be given to the Gentiles; the
witnesses shall be slain; antichrist will be "in statu quo"; and the
whore of Rome in all her glory; though it shall not last long:

but he shall be saved out of it; shall come out of those great
tribulations into a very happy and comfortable estate; the spirit of
life shall enter into the witnesses, and they shall live and ascend to
heaven; the vials of God's wrath will be poured upon the antichristian
states; the kings of the earth will hate the whore, and burn her with
fire; the Gospel will be preached everywhere; the Jews will be
converted, and the fulness of the Gentiles be brought in; and an end be
put to all trouble; of which there will be no more, nor any occasion of
it: or, "therefore he shall be saved out of it" (r); as the effect of
the divine compassion to him in such great trouble.

\(r\) "ideo ex eo servabitur", Schmidt.

[Jeremiah 30:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 30:8</span></span>

For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord of hosts,.... When
the time is come for Jacob to be saved out of his trouble:

that I will break his yoke from off thy neck; not the yoke of the king
of Babylon, but of antichrist, and of all the antichristian states, by
whom the people of God have been oppressed; so the Targum,

"I will break the yoke of the peoples (the antichristian nations) from
off your necks.''

Jarchi interprets it of the yoke of the nations of the world from off
Israel; and Kimchi of the yoke of Gog and Magog, or of every nation:

and will burst thy bonds; by which they were kept in bondage, both with
respect to civil and religious things; but now he that led into
captivity shall go into captivity himself, [Rev
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#010.md);

and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him; this shows that
this prophecy cannot be understood of deliverance from the Babylonish
captivity; because, after this, strangers did serve themselves of the
Jews, and they were servants unto them; as to the Persians, and
Grecians, and especially the Romans, by whom they were entirely subdued
and ruined; and to this day all nations almost serve themselves of them;
but when they shall be called and converted, as they shall be free from
the yoke of sin and Satan, and from the yoke of the ceremonial law, and
the traditions of their elders, in a religious sense; so from the yoke
of the nations of the world, in a civil sense.

[Jeremiah 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 30:9</span></span>

But they shall serve the Lord their God,.... And him only, in a
spiritual manner, in righteousness and true holiness, with reverence and
godly fear; having respect to all his precepts and ordinances, and every
branch of religious worship; joining themselves to Gospel churches, and
worshipping along with them, before them, and in the midst of them; see
[Rev 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#009.md);

and David their king; not literally, who shall be raised up from the
dead, and reign over them, which Kimchi supposes possible, though he
does not assert it; nor his successors called by his name, as the kings
of Egypt were called Pharaohs and Ptolemies, and the Roman emperors
Caesars, of which we have no instance; nor were there any kings of
David's line upon the throne of Israel after the Babylonish captivity,
until the Messiah came, and who is the Person here meant; and so the
Targum paraphrases it,

"and they shall hearken to, or obey, Messiah the son of David their
king;''

and Kimchi owns that it may be interpreted of Messiah the son of David,
whose name is called David, as it is in many prophecies, [Eze
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023.md); and this prophecy is understood
of the Messiah by several Jewish writers (s); and in the Talmud (t) it
is said,

"the holy blessed God will raise up unto thee another David; as it is
said, "and they shall serve the Lord their God, and David their king,
whom I will raise up unto them"; it is not said, "he hath raised up",
but "I will raise up";''

and Christ is called David, not only because he is his son, but because
he is his antitype. David was a type of Christ in his birth and
parentage; the son of Jesse, born of mean parents, and at Bethlehem; in
his outward form, ruddy and beautiful; in his inward character, a man of
holiness, wisdom, and courage; in his offices of shepherd, prophet, and
king; in his afflictions and sorrows, and in his wars and victories. The
same Person is here meant as in the former clause, "the Lord their God";
since it is Jehovah that is here speaking; and he does not say "they
shall serve me", but "the Lord their God"; and since the same service is
to be yielded to David as to the Lord their God; and who is, in his
divine nature, the Lord God, and so the object of all religious worship
and service; and, in his human nature, of the seed of David; and by
office a King, appointed by his Father, and owned by his people, as King
of saints; so the words may be rendered, "they shall serve the Lord
their God, even David their King"; see [Tit
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013.md);

whom I will raise up unto them; which is said of him in all his offices,
[Jer 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005.md); and is expressive of his
constitution as Mediator; and includes the Father's pitching upon him,
appointing him, calling him, fitting and qualifying him, and sending him
in the fulness of time, under this character, as a Mediator, Redeemer,
and Saviour; all which was for the good of his people; as a favour to
them, for their profit and advantage: his incarnation is for them; his
obedience, sufferings, and death; his righteousness, and the salvation
he wrought out; he is raised up, and sent to them to bless them, with
all spiritual blessings that are in him, [Act
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#026.md).

[Jeremiah 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 30:10</span></span>

Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the Lord,.... Since
the Messiah, who is the Lord God, should be raised up to thorn, whom
they should serve, and he should save them; and so had nothing to fear
from their enemies; and had no reason to doubt of salvation and
deliverance, seeing so great a person was engaged for them. The language
is very much like the Prophet Isaiah's:

neither be dismayed, O Israel: the same thing in other words; for Jacob
and Israel are the same; and to fear and be dismayed are much alike:

for, lo, I will save thee from afar; from a far country; not from
Babylon only, but from all distant countries where they are dispersed,
east, west, north, or south; distance of place should be no hinderance
to their salvation, and so need be no objection in their minds to it:

and thy seed from the land of their captivity; their children should
come forth with them: it seems to respect future times; that though this
should not be accomplished in the persons of the Israelites then living,
yet should be in their posterity:

and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none
shall make him afraid; which was not fulfilled upon the Jews' return
from the Babylonish captivity; for they quickly met with much opposition
and disturbance in the rebuilding of their city and temple; and
afterwards from Antiochus, in the times of the Maccabees, by whom they
were greatly disquieted; and at last by the Romans, by whom their nation
was subdued and ruined; wherefore this respects the quiet and peaceable
times they shall have when they are converted, and have embraced the
Christian religion.

[Jeremiah 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 30:11</span></span>

For I am with thee, saith the Lord, to save thee,.... Not only from
temporal enemies, but from spiritual ones, sin, Satan, and the world;
and to save them with a spiritual and everlasting salvation, which the
presence and power of God, through his rich grace, will bring all his
people to:

though I will make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered
thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee; a full end has been made
of the Assyrians, Chaldeans, and Egyptians; these people and their names
are no more; and of Rome Pagan, which, upon the opening of the sixth
seal, departed as a scroll that is rolled together; and so will all the
antichristian states be made a full end of, when the vials of God's
wrath are poured out upon them; and yet the people of the Jews, a poor,
mean, and despicable people, have been continued a distinct people,
notwithstanding their dispersion so many hundreds of years; and will
continue so until they are called and converted:

but I will correct thee in measure; or "in", or "according to judgment"
(u); as in [Jer 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#024.md); wisely,
moderately, and with clemency; which the Targum paraphrases "judgment
remitted"; which is not strict and rigorous, but is abated of its
rigour, and is mixed with mercy:

and will not leave thee altogether unpunished; or, "let thee go free";
from correction and chastisement in a merciful way. The Targum is,

"in destroying I will not destroy thee;''

or utterly destroy thee. And Kimchi and Ben Melech interpret it of
cutting off, from the use of the word in [Zac
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#003.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 30:12</span></span>

For thus saith the Lord, thy bruise is incurable,.... By themselves or
others, in all human appearance; there was no help for them from men;
their case seemed desperate; there was no likelihood of their recovery
to their former state and glory, as at this day the case of the Jews
appears to be; there seems to be no probability of their conversion and
restoration; and whenever it is, it will be as life from the dead, [Rom
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#015.md); like quickening Ezekiel's dry
bones, or raising persons from the dead, which none but the hand of
omnipotence can effect:

and thy wound is grievous; an expression signifying the same as before:
the metaphor is taken from a body wounded and bruised in such a manner,
as to be past the skill of the most able surgeon to cure it.

[Jeremiah 30:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 30:13</span></span>

There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up,.... None
that will give themselves the trouble to look into their wound to judge
of it; to consult, and reason, and debate about the nature of it; and
what methods are most advisable to take for the healing and binding of
it up: or, as others, "for the compression" (w) of it; the squeezing out
the corrupt matter, in order to bring it to a cure:

thou hast no healing medicines; either of thine own, or of others,
preparing for thee: the design of all these expressions is to show the
helpless and hopeless state of the people of Israel, before their call,
conversion, and restoration; by which it will appear to be the Lord's
work, and his only; and since he was able to do it, and would do it,
therefore Jacob and Israel had no reason to be afraid and dismayed,
though their case might seem desperate.

[Jeremiah 30:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 30:14</span></span>

All thy lovers have forgotten thee,.... The Egyptians and Assyrians,
whom they sought unto for help, and entered into an alliance with, and
who promised them great things; but forgot their promises and forsook
them:

they seek thee not; to ask of thy welfare, as the Targum adds; they do
not, visit thee, nor inquire after thine health, or how it is with thee,
having no manner of care and concern for thee; this has been the case of
the Jews for many ages:

for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the
chastisement of a cruel one; so it might seem to be; and thus it might
be interpreted by them, as if the Lord acted the part of an enemy, and a
very cruel one, that had no mercy; though he corrected them, as in [Jer
30:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#011.md), in measure, moderation, and
mercy: or else the meaning is, that he wounded them, when their nation,
city, and temple, were destroyed, by the hand and means of an enemy,
even a very cruel and merciless one, the Romans:

for the multitude of thine iniquity; because thy sins were increased; a
very wicked people the Jews were, not only before they went into the
Babylonish captivity, but after their return; and in the times of Christ
and his apostles; who complain of their covetousness, hypocrisy,
adultery, thefts, murders, and sacrilege; and particularly they were in
the above manner chastised by means of the Romans, for their unbelief
and rejection of the true Messiah, and the persecution of his followers.

[Jeremiah 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 30:15</span></span>

Why criest thou for thine affliction?.... Or complainest of the
hardness, and heaviness, and continuance of it, when there was such a
just cause for it? when men have sinned at a high rate, they have no
reason to complain of the punishment of their sins, [Lam
3:39](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#039.md);

thy sorrow is incurable, for the multitude of thine iniquity; such were
the number of their iniquities, that they brought them into such a
sorrowful and wretched estate and condition that there was no recovery
of them, nor hope of recovery of them, by their own power, or by the
help and assistance of others:

because thy sins were increased I have done these things unto thee;
which shows the justice of God, and is a vindication of it under all the
seeming severity of it. The Jews (x) acknowledge, that under the second
temple there was a great increase of capital crimes, such as murders,
adulteries, &c. for which, and other sins, wrath came upon them to the
uttermost by the Romans; and they still continue under the visible marks
of the divine displeasure.

Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured,.... Thus
rendering the words, they are to be connected with [Jer
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#010.md); and all between to be put into
a parenthesis: but rather, in connection with the preceding words, they
should be rendered "nevertheless", or "notwithstanding" (y); though they
had sinned at so great a rate, and were so much afflicted and chastened
by the Lord, yet their enemies should not go unpunished, and mercy in
the issue would be showed to them. Jarchi calls it an oath, that so it
should be; the Romans that devoured them, and ate up their substance,
were devoured by the Goths and Vandals; for this may be carried further
than to the destruction of the Babylonish empire by the Persians;

and all thine adversaries, everyone of them shall, fro into captivity;
or be conquered and subdued, as were the Assyrians, Egyptians,
Chaldeans, Grecians, Romans; and not only Rome Pagan has been destroyed,
but Rome Papal also will go into captivity; see [Rev
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#010.md);

and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee
will I give for a prey: they shall be used according to the law of
retaliation; the same measure they have measured shall be measured to
them again.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 30:17</span></span>

For I will restore health to thee,.... That is, bring thee into a
comfortable and prosperous condition, both in church and state, with
respect to things religions and civil: as the afflictions and distresses
of the Jewish nation are expressed by sickness, wounds, and bruises; so
their prosperity, both spiritual and temporal, is signified by health.
The words may be rendered, "I will cause length to ascend unto thee"; or
a long plaster (z); or rather, that which has been long looked for, and
long in coming, prosperity; or else, that whereas they were before bowed
down with afflictions and sorrows, now they should be as a man in an
erect posture, that rises up in his full height and length, being in a
robust and healthful state;

and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the Lord; pardon their sins,
remove their afflictions, and bring them into a comfortable situation,
into a Gospel church state, and into their own land:

because they called thee an outcast; as the Jews now are, cast out of
their own land, rejected from being the people of God; so they are
reckoned by the nations among whom they are:

saying, this is Zion, whom no man seeketh after: after their good,
either temporal or spiritual; despised by most, pitied and prayed for by
few; and fewer still they are that seek after, and are solicitous about,
or take any methods, or make use of any means, for their conversion; but
though man does not, God will, and his work will appear the more
manifest.

Thus saith the Lord, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob's
tents,.... That is, the captives of Israel, the inhabitants of them;
alluding to the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, dwelling in
tents, and to the Israelites in the wilderness; and fitly expresses the
present unsettled state of the Jews:

and have mercy on his dwelling places; by restoring Israel, or Jacob's
posterity, to their dwelling places in Jerusalem, and other places
rebuilt by them and for them. The Targum is,

"I will have mercy on his cities;''

and the city shall be builded upon her own heap; the city of Jerusalem,
as the Targum expresses it, as it was in the times of Zerubbabel; it was
built in its place, as the same Targum; upon the very spot of ground
where it before stood, which was become by its desolation a heap of
rubbish: or, "upon its hill" (a); Mount Moriah, on which some part of
the city was built; so likewise in the latter day: though Jerusalem was
destroyed by the Romans, and is now in a desolate condition, yet it
shall be rebuilt, as it seems by this prophecy, upon the very spot where
it formerly stood;

and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof; which the Targum
interprets of the house of the sanctuary, the temple; so Jarchi; and it
was true of it in Zerubbabel's time: but as this prophecy has a further
view to future times, something else seems intended. Kimchi says it is
either the king's palace or the temple. The singular may be put for the
plural, and design "palaces", noble and stately buildings; signifying
that the city shall be rebuilt in a very grand manner: and so "shall
remain after the manner of it"; or, "according to its right" or
"judgment" (b); it shall be continued and established by or upon that
justice and judgment that shall be done in it; for it shall be called a
city of righteousness, and a faithful city, [Isa
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#026.md).

[Jeremiah 30:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 30:19</span></span>

And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving, and the voice of them that
make merry,.... That is, out of Jacob's tents and dwelling places, the
city and palaces of Jerusalem; for those who will inhabit them, when
thus rebuilt, sensible of the divine favours, and thankful for them,
will offer not any ceremonial sacrifices, as when before in their own
land, which they will now see are abolished; but the sacrifices of
praise and thanksgiving only, which will be attended with great
spiritual mirth and melody: perhaps this is said in allusion to the
mirth and music used formerly in the solemn and religious festivals; see
[Rev 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#001.md);

and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; the Jews, at the
time of their conversion, will be very numerous, [Hos
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#010.md); especially the number of God's
spiritual Israel will then be very great; though Jacob is now small, he
shall then arise and become a great multitude; the church's converts
will be surprisingly many, [Isa 49:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#018.md);

and I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small; numbers of
converts add to the glory of the church; it will be a glorious time; and
this is what will make a considerable part of the latter day glory;
namely, the conversion of the nation of the Jews at once, and the
bringing in the fulness and forces of the Gentiles. The Targum is,

"I will strengthen them, and they shall not be weak.''

It may be rendered, "I will honour them, and they shall not be little"
(c); or "mean" and contemptible; they shall be honoured with temporal
and spiritual blessings, and be in great esteem, especially among the
Christian nations.

Their children also shall be as aforetime,.... In the streets of
Jerusalem, numerous and free; no more in a strange land, or subject to
others, [Zac 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#005.md); and educated in a
religious manner. Some think it refers to the times of the patriarchs
before the law was given; and that the meaning is, that the law being
abrogated, and they now sensible of it, shall live without it, as their
forefathers did. It may be understood of the church's children in a
spiritual sense; that great numbers should be born again in her as
formerly, who shall profess the Christian religion, and behave according
to it:

and their congregation shall be established before me; the church,
consisting of them; or their church state shall be settled and
confirmed, and no more be destroyed, as it formerly was:

and I will punish all that oppress them; or rather, have oppressed them;
all the antichristian nations, who will now suffer the wrath of God; and
after this there will be no more oppressors and persecutors of the
church of God.

[Jeremiah 30:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 30:21</span></span>

And their nobles shall be of themselves,.... Or, "his noble One" (d);
Jacob's noble One, the Messiah, in whom all the promises centre; and
whose incarnation and priesthood are the foundation of all the things
above predicted. The Targum interprets these words of him;

"their King shall be anointed from them, and their Messiah shall be
revealed from the midst of them.''

And so it is applied to him in the Talmud (e), and in other writings of
the Jews (f). Kimchi on the place says,

"it is known that the King Messiah shall be of Israel.''

He may be called a "noble One", as he is a Nobleman in [Luk
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#012.md); because he descended from
illustrious persons; from David king of Israel, and from a race of kings
in his line, as the genealogy of Matthew shows. Or, "his glorious One"
(g), as it may be rendered; he is glorious in his nature, being the
brightness of his Father's glory; glorious in his perfections, which are
the same with his divine Father's; glorious in his names and titles, the
King and Lord of glory; glorious in his works and worship, which are the
same that are ascribed to God the Father; glorious in his office as
Mediator, which he has so well performed; glorious when he was raised
from the dead, and had a glory given him; and when he ascended on high,
and sat down at his Father's right hand, crowned with glory and honour;
glorious in the eyes of God, and of all his people; and, when his
kingdom shall be in a more glorious condition, he will reign before his
ancients gloriously; and when he comes a second time, he will come in
exceeding great glory. Or, his "mighty One" (h); Christ is the mighty
God, the mighty Mediator, the mighty Saviour; he is the most Mighty, he
is the Almighty. Now, as man, his descent was from them, the Israelites;
from Abraham, from Jacob, from Judah, from Jesse and David, and from the
people of the Jews; see [Rom 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004.md);

and their Governor shall proceed from the midst of them; meaning the
King Messiah, as before; who has the government of the church upon his
shoulders; is worthy of all power and authority and has received it; has
a power of making laws, and of obliging men to keep them; has a power of
pardoning, justifying, and saving men; is the lawgiver that is able to
save, and to destroy; and can subject all to his feet, as he will in a
short time. This seems to refer to a law in Israel, that not a stranger,
but one of their brethren, should be set as king over them, [Deu
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#015.md); which is true of the Messiah;

and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me;
expressive of his priestly office; it being the business of a priest to
draw nigh to God with the sacrifices of the people, and to intercede for
them, [Lev 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#003.md). Christ in eternity
drew nigh to his Father, and offered himself as a surety for his people,
and became one; and the Greek word for surety, has the signification of
being "near": he drew nigh and interposed between them and his father,
and became a Mediator for them; he proposed to do everything for them
law and justice required, and whatsoever was his Father's will should be
done: he drew nigh and struck hands, stipulated and agreed with him,
about the salvation of his people; he asked them of him, and all
blessings of grace and glory for them: he drew nigh in time, having
assumed their nature, and offered himself a sacrifice unto God, made
satisfaction to his justice for them, and redeemed them unto God by his
blood; by which means they are made nigh to God, and draw near to him
with humble boldness; and now he is gone to heaven, and has taken his
place at the right hand of God, where he appears in the presence of God,
and makes intercession for them, presenting himself, his blood,
righteousness, and sacrifice. Now this is ascribed unto God, as causing
him to draw nigh; because he chose, appointed, and called him to be a
priest, Mediator, and surety, to which he was entirely free of himself;
and therefore it follows,

for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the
Lord; his drawing to God in the council and covenant of grace, to be the
surety of his people, and his undertaking for them, were quite free and
voluntary; he came of himself, and surrendered himself into the hands of
justice at the time of his sufferings and death; and his intercession in
heaven flows from his hearty love to his people; his heart has been, and
is, engaged in every branch of his mediatorial work, which is a very
singular and wonderful thing. No mere man could have engaged his heart
to draw nigh to God, who is a consuming fire; no angel in heaven could
have presumed to have done it on the behalf of sinful men; none but
Christ himself could, and which is owing to the dignity of his person,
and to his wondrous love; for this is a marvellous event. Now, though
this is a prophecy of Christ's incarnation and priesthood, yet it is
suitably introduced here; because, at the time of the Jews' conversion,
he will be made known unto them, as being come of them, and as their
Prophet, Priest, and King.

And ye shall be my people,.... For many hundred years the people of the
Jews have been called "Loammi" or, "ye are not my people", [Hos
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#009.md); but now being converted, the
covenant of God's grace shall be renewed, and a fresh manifestation and
application of it made unto them; and they partaking of the grace of it,
shall appear to be, and shall be, called the people of God, and shall
behave as such, and fear and worship the Lord:

and I will be your God; will manifest his love to them, bestow his
favours upon them, and take them under his care and protection. This is
a summary of the covenant of grace, which will visibly take place when
those people shall turn to the Lord, [Rom
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026.md).

[Jeremiah 30:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 30:23</span></span>

Behold, the whirlwind of the Lord goeth forth with fury,.... That is,
the wrath of God, which like a whirlwind comes suddenly, with great
force and strength, and carries all before it; there is no withstanding
it; such is the wrath of God against the enemies of his church and
people:

a continuing whirlwind; whirlwinds, as they come suddenly, are generally
soon over; but this will continue very boisterous and terrible, until it
has done all the execution designed by it:

it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked; according to some,
the wicked Jews, that do not repent and turn to the Lord; but rather the
wicked of the nations, as Jarchi; not the Gentiles in general, as
distinguished from the Jews, which is his sense, but the antichristian
states; for the ruin of antichrist, and the conversion of the Jews, will
be much about the same time; and the vials of God's wrath, which will be
poured upon them, and fall upon their heads, will give them much pain,
both in body and mind; see [Rev 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#010.md);
and which wrath and ruin are expressed by a tempest of thunder,
lightning, and hail, and by an earthquake, [Jer
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#018.md).

[Jeremiah 30:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 30:24</span></span>

The fierce anger of the Lord shall not return,.... This explains what is
meant by the continuing whirlwind in [Jer
30:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#023.md);

until he hath done it; his whole will and pleasure; brought Babylon to
ruin, and destroyed all the antichristian powers:

and until he hath performed the intents of his heart; in a way of grace
and mercy to his people, and in a way of wrath and vengeance on their
enemies:

in the latter day ye shall consider it; this prophecy, and understand
it; and see it wholly and fully accomplished.
