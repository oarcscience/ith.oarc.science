INTRODUCTION TO NUMBERS 3

In this chapter an account is given of the genealogy of the priests and
Levites, and of the gift of the Levites to the priests, of the numbering
of them, and the service they were to perform; and first of the priests,
the sons of Aaron, [Num 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#001.md); and then
of the Levites, as given unto them, to wait upon them, and assist them,
[Num 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#005.md); and these were taken instead
of the firstborn, [Num 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#011.md); and
ordered to be numbered, which was done accordingly by their families,
[Num 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#014.md); and the sum of each is
given, and the particular work assigned to them; of the Gershonites,
[Num 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#021.md); of the Kohathites, [Num
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#027.md); of the Merarites, [Num
3:33](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#033.md); the sum total of them is given,
[Num 3:39](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#039.md); then the firstborn of the
children of Israel, from a month old are ordered to be numbered, and
were, [Num 3:40](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#040.md); and these appearing
to be more in number than the Levites, by two hundred seventy three a
direction is given that the two hundred seventy three should be redeemed
at the rate of five, shekels apiece, and the money paid to Aaron and his
sons, [Num 3:44](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#044.md); which was accordingly
done, [Num 3:49](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#049.md).

[Numbers 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 3:1</span></span>

These also are the generations of Aaron and Moses,.... The descendants
of them, those of the former, who is named first, because the eldest,
were priests, and those of the latter Levites, and who are not very
plainly pointed at, but are included among the Amramites, [Num
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#027.md); the posterity of Moses being
very obscure, only Levites, and these not particularly named but
swallowed up among the Kohathites: find the following account was as it
stood:

in the day that the Lord spoke with Moses in mount Sinai; and not,
altogether as it then, was when he spoke to him in the wilderness, of
Sinai, for then Aaron had four sons, but now two of them were dead as is
after observed; and it seems to be for the sake of this circumstance
chiefly that this clause is so put.

[Numbers 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 3:2</span></span>

And these are the names of the sons of Aaron,.... The Targum of Jonathan
adds, disciples of Moses, the master of the Israelites; none of the
posterity of Moses being expressly, named; Jarchi observes, that the
sons of Aaron are called the generations of Moses, because he taught
them the law; for whoever, he says, teaches his neighbour's son, the
law, the Scripture accounts of him as if he begat him, see [Co1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#015.md),

Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar; as in [Exo
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#023.md).

[Numbers 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 3:3</span></span>

These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests that were
anointed,.... With the holy, anointing oil, with which they were
anointed when, Aaron was and they only, see [Exo
30:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#030.md),

whom he consecrated to minister in the priest's office; that is, whom
Moses consecrated, by anointing them, putting the priest's garments on
them, offering sacrifice for them, and filling their hands with
sacrifices which is the phrase here used for consecration: see [Exo
29:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#015.md).

[Numbers 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 3:4</span></span>

And Nadab and Abihu died before the Lord,...., By flaming fire, as the
Targum of Jonathan adds, see [Lev
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#002.md); and so were not alive at this
time when the account of the priests and Levites was taken:

when they offered strange fire before the Lord in the wilderness of
Sinai; after the tabernacle was set up, and the service of it begun, and
quickly after their unction and consecration: of this strange fire; see
Gill on [Num 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#001.md),

and they had no children; which is observed, partly to show the
punishment of them, and the reproach upon their names, that they died
childless, and had none to succeed them in the priesthood; for as the
Jewish writers (n) observe if they had left any behind them, those would
have come into the office before Eleazar and Ithamar; and partly to show
that all the priests in succeeding ages sprung from those next
mentioned:

and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest's office, in the sight
of Aaron their father; in his presence, under his inspection, and by his
direction, he seeing and observing that they did everything according to
the laws delivered by Moses, relating to, the office of the priesthood;
or while he was yet alive, as Aben Ezra, they were concerned with him,
and acted under him in the priestly office; and so the Septuagint
version renders it, "with Aaron their father" (o); but a Jewish writer
(p) interprets it in a different manner, "in the room of Aaron their
father"; as if it respected not any conjunction with him in the then
present exercise of their office in his lifetime, but their succession
in it after his death; but the former seems most correct.

[Numbers 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 3:5</span></span>

And the Lord spake unto Moses,.... After he had given him the order for
the numbering the children of Israel, and for the manner of their
encampment and journeying:

saying; as follows.

[Numbers 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 3:6</span></span>

Bring the tribe of Levi near,.... Separate them from the rest, set them
apart for special service about, the sanctuary, let them have a place
nearer to it than the other tribes, or offer them, that is, to the Lord,
as in [Num 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#011.md); as well as bring them
near to Aaron; so it follows:

and present them before Aaron the priest; that he may receive them as a
gift unto him, as servants to wait upon him; and! that he may appoint
and declare unto them their work, and set them about it:

that they may minister unto him; in guarding the tabernacle taking care
of the vessels of it, taking it down, carrying it, from place to place,
and setting it up as there was occasion for it.

[Numbers 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 3:7</span></span>

And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole
congregation,.... The charge of Aaron and of all the people of Israel,
which was to secure the sanctuary from being polluted or plundered: this
the Levites were to be employed about, and thereby ease the high priest
and the other priests, and the people, of what otherwise would have been
incumbent on them:

before the tabernacle of the congregation; not within it, neither in the
holy place, nor in the most holy place, where they might not enter, to
do any service peculiar thereunto, but at the door of the tabernacle,
and in the court of it, and in the rooms and chambers in it: and do the
service of the tabernacle; not to offer sacrifices on the altar of the
burnt offering, which stood in the court, and much less to burn incense
on the altar of incense, and to him the lamps, and set on the shewbread
in the holy place; and still less to enter into the most holy place, and
do there what was to be done on the day of atonement; but to do all that
is before observed, and to bring the people's offerings to the priest,
and to assist in slaying them; and to keep all profane and polluted
persons out of it, the tabernacle, as we find in later times; they were
porters at it, and some of them were singers in it, and had the care of
various things belonging to it: see [Ch1
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#014.md).

[Numbers 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 3:8</span></span>

And they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of the
congregation,.... Take care of them that none be lost or come to any
damage, especially while it was moving, and carried from place to place;
then the several parts of it, as well as the vessels in it, were
committed to their care and charge, the particulars of which see in [Num
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#025.md),

and the charge of the children of Israel, to do the service of the
tabernacle; See Gill on [Num 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#007.md).

[Numbers 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 3:9</span></span>

And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons,.... To be
their ministers and servants:

they are wholly given unto him out of the children of Israel: even all
of them entirely, none excepted; the whole tribe which were not in the
priestly office; those were separated from the rest of the tribes of
Israel, and appointed for the service of the priests: or they were
"given, given" (q); which is repeated not only to show that they were
wholly given, as we render it, but to denote the certainty of it, that
they were really given; and especially to declare the freeness of the
gift; the priests had them as free gifts, nor did they pay them any
thing for, their service; they were maintained another way, namely, by
the tithes of the people; and indeed the priests received a tithe out of
the tithe of the Levites; so far were they from contributing any thing
to their support, or in consideration of the service they did them.

[Numbers 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 3:10</span></span>

And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons,.... To the priestly office;
this was done before, but is renewed for the confirmation of it, and
repeated to put them in mind of it, that they be careful to execute it,
as follows:

and they shall wait on their priest's office, to do what was peculiar to
it, both in the holy and in the most holy place, at the altar, and
within, the vail, where the Levites had nothing to do; and this is
observed that the priests might take notice, that by the gift of the
Levites to them, they were not excused from doing any part of service
which was proper to them as priests; for they were given them that they
might more readily attend their office, and be wholly employed in it;
just as, under the Gospel dispensation, deacons were appointed to take
care of the secular affairs of the church, that the apostles might give
up themselves to the word of God and prayer, [Act
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#002.md),

and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death; that comes nigh
to perform any part of the priest's office peculiar to him as to offer
sacrifice, burn incense, &c. whether he be a common Israelite, or even a
Levite, as Korah was; any that was not a priest was reckoned a stranger,
and so to be put to death for intruding into the office, as the above
mentioned person was: so Aben Ezra interprets it of anyone that came
nigh to a priest, to be with him or join with him in the execution of
his office, whether an Israelite or a Levite, he shall die: the Targum
of Jonathan adds, by flaming fire before the Lord.

[Numbers 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 3:11</span></span>

And the Lord spake unto Moses,.... Continued to speak unto him, and give
him the reason of his appointing the Levites to minister to the priests
and serve the tabernacle:

saying: as follows.

[Numbers 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 3:12</span></span>

And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of
Israel,.... Separated them from others, and set them apart for the
service of the sanctuary; this was his own act and deed, and which he
did of his own will and pleasure, who is a sovereign Being, and might
and would do whatsoever he pleased, nor should any object unto him, or
contradict him: and this he did:

instead of all the firstborn that openeth the matrix among the children
of Israel; he made an exchange of those for the Levites; upon the
destruction of the firstborn of Egypt, and saving the firstborn of
Israel, he claimed the latter as his own in a special sense, and now he
gave up his right to them, and instead thereof took the Levites; nor
could the people of Israel reasonably object to this, nor be uneasy at
it, but rather be pleased with it; since hereby they were not only freed
from the charge of redeeming their firstborn, but since they were the
Lord's, he might have appointed them to be servants to the priests; and
every Israelite would choose rather, no doubt, to part with a tribe for
this service than to have their firstborn sons employed in it; and there
were none so fit as the tribe of Levi, not only because it was a small
tribe, but because the priests were of this tribe, to whom they were to
minister; and therefore as there was a connection between them, the
Levites would readily serve them: it is a notion that has obtained both
among Jews and Christians, that the firstborn before this time were
priests in the family, but now the Levites were taken in their room; and
Jarchi particularly observes, that when the firstborn sinned in the
business of the calf, they were rejected, and the Levites, who did not
commit idolatry, were chosen in their room; but it does not appear,
before the fixing the priesthood in Aaron's family, that the firstborn
in a family were priests, and officiated as such, but rather the father
and head of the family for the whole, or everyone for himself, as in
Adam's family, he and his two sons; and moreover, it was a recent thing,
and only among the Hebrews, that the firstborn were in a peculiar manner
the Lord's, not as priests, only to be redeemed, and now the Levites
were redeemed in their room; it was not to be priests, but the servants
of the priests (r):

therefore the Levites shall be mine; whom he gave to the priests to
assist them in their work, which was for him and his glory.

\(r\) Vid. Outram. de Sacrificiis, l. 1. c. 4. sect. 1, 2, 3.

[Numbers 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 3:13</span></span>

Because all the firstborn are mine,.... Not merely in a general way, as
all creatures are his, but in a special manner as his own, and that for
the following reason:

for on the day that I smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt,

I hallowed unto me all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast; that
is, sanctified or set them apart as his own special property, or ordered
the people of Israel so to do, [Exo
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#002.md); for as when he destroyed the
firstborn of the Egyptians, he saved the firstborn of Israel, he had a
special claim upon them as his; and though it was in the night when he
destroyed the firstborn of Egypt, yet it was the night which preceded
that day, and was a part of that day, even the fifteenth of Nisan, when
the instructions were given to sanctify all the firstborn; though, as
Aben Ezra observes, "day" signifies "time", so that it was at or about
the same time that the one and the other were done:

mine they shall be; this was declared when they were ordered to be
sanctified to him, but now they were to be exchanged for the Levites:

I am the Lord; who have sovereign power to do as he would in claiming
the firstborn, and then in exchanging them for the Levites, and
appointing the Levites to minister to the priests, and serve in the
tabernacle.

[Numbers 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">num 3:14</span></span>

And the Lord spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai,.... At the
same time he gave the order, and made the declaration before mentioned,
and in the place where now the children of Israel were, and from whence
they shortly removed:

saying; as follows.

[Numbers 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">num 3:15</span></span>

Number the children of Levi,.... Who were left out of the general muster
of the children of Israel, but now were to be numbered alone, and in a
different manner, and for, a different purpose, the Lord having a
special regard auto, them, and special service for them:

after the house of their fathers, by their families; into which the
tribe was divided; house seems to be put for "houses", which were
principal ones; and these were divided into families, which branched
from them, and according to these, denominated from their fathers, and
not their, mothers, were they to be numbered; for as the Jewish writers
often say, a mother's family is no family; wherefore, if a Levite woman
married into any other tribe, as she might, her, descendants were not
taken into this accounts only such whose fathers were Levites, see [Num
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#002.md),

every male from a month old and upwards shalt thou number them; the
reason of this was, because the firstborn, for whom they were to be
exchanged, were at a month old claimed by the Lord as his, and to be
redeemed; and as this numbering was on, another account than, that of
the children of Israel, who were numbered from twenty years of age and
upwards, that they might on occasion be called out to war, from which
the Levites were exempted, and the numbering of them was for the service
of the sanctuary; so from their youth they were to be brought up and
trained for this, that they might be fit for it, and enter upon it at a
proper age.

[Numbers 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 3:16</span></span>

And Moses numbered them according to the word of the Lord,.... Took the
account of all of a month old in the several houses and families of the
tribe of Levi; though Moses is only here mentioned, yet it seems from
[Num 3:39](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#039.md); that Aaron was concerned
with him in it; yea, in an after numbering of the Levites who were fit
for business from thirty to fifty years of age, the chief of the
children of Israel were assisting to him and Aaron, [Num
4:46](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#046.md),

as he commanded; he was obedient to the divine will in all things, and
so in this, though it was his own tribe and his own posterity, which in
all successive ages were to be no other than ministering servants to the
priests, and to have no inheritance in the land of Israel.

[Numbers 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">num 3:17</span></span>

And these were the sons of Levi, by their names,.... The immediate
offspring and descendants of that patriarch:

Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari; these went down with him into Egypt,
[Gen 46:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#011.md).

[Numbers 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">num 3:18</span></span>

And these are the names of the sons of Gershon, by their families,....
Or to Gershon belonged two families, called after the names of his sons,
who were now numbered, namely:

Libni and Shimei; and who are elsewhere mentioned as his sons, [Exo
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#017.md); and from hence were the families
of the Libnites and Shimites, as in [Num
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#021.md).

[Numbers 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">num 3:19</span></span>

And the sons of Kohath, by their families,.... Who was the second son of
Levi:

Amram, and Izehar, Hebron, and Uzziel; so in [Exo
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#018.md); and from whom were named the
family of the Amramites, to which Moses and Aaron belonged; and the
families of the Izeharites, Hebronites, and Uzzielites, as they are
called, [Num 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#027.md).

[Numbers 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 3:20</span></span>

And the sons, of Merari, by their families,.... The third son of Levi:

Mahli and Mushi; the same as in [Exo
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#019.md); from whom were denominated the
families of the Mahlites and Mushites, who, as the preceding families,
were numbered at this time: these

are the families of the Levites, according to the house of their
fathers; in all eight families.

[Numbers 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 3:21</span></span>

Of Gershon was the family of the Libnites, and the family of the
Shimites,.... The first son of Levi:

these are the family of the Gershonites; that were now, numbered.

[Numbers 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">num 3:22</span></span>

Those that were numbered of them,.... Of the two families that sprung
from Gershon:

according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upwards:
in the said families:

even those that were numbered of them, were seven thousand and five
hundred; 7,500 men, which was neither the least nor the largest number
of the sons of Levi.

[Numbers 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">num 3:23</span></span>

The families of the Gershonites,.... The two before mentioned, the
Libnites and Shimites:

shall pitch behind the tabernacle westward; this was their situation
when encamped; they were placed in the rear of the camp of the Levites,
between the tabernacle and the camp of Ephraim, which was westward also,
[Num 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#018.md).

[Numbers 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">num 3:24</span></span>

And the chief of the house of the fathers of the Gershonites,.... Who
had the chief authority over them, and the chief direction of them in
what they were to do:

shall be Eliasaph the son of Lael; but who he was, or of which family of
the Gershonites, whether of the Libnites or Shimites, is not said here
or elsewhere; nor do the Jewish writers, who affect to know every thing,
pretend to tell us.

[Numbers 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">num 3:25</span></span>

And the charge of the sons of Gershom,.... The Libnites and Shimites:

in the tabernacle of the congregation; or with respect to the things of
it, when it was taken down and committed to them; for otherwise they had
no place in it, nor might they enter into it, or do any service therein:

shall be the tabernacle and the tent; the former intends not the boards
of it, which were the charge of the Merarites, [Num
3:36](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#036.md); but the curtains, as Aben Ezra,
or the under curtains, as Jarchi calls them, which were made of fine
twined linen, [Exo 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001.md); and the
latter is to be understood of the eleven curtains, as Aben Ezra, the
curtains of goats hair, which were made for the roof of the tabernacle,
as Jarchi observes, see [Exo 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#007.md),

the covering thereof: made of rams' skins, and badgers' skins, which
were thrown over the tent, [Exo 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#014.md),

and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation; the
vail, as Jarchi calls it; not what divided the holy and most holy
places, for that fell to the charge of the Kohathites, [Num
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#031.md); but the vail or hanging which
was at the door of the tent, or which led into the holy place, [Exo
26:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#036.md).

[Numbers 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">num 3:26</span></span>

And the hangings of the court,.... Which formed the great open court
that encompassed the tabernacle, and was an hundred cubits long and
fifty broad; [Exo 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#009.md),

and the curtain for the door of the court: which was an hanging of
twenty cubits, of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen, [Exo
27:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#016.md),

which is by the tabernacle, and by the altar round about: this refers to
the court, the hangings, and curtains of the door of it, which are
spoken of; and this court surrounded the tabernacle, and the altar which
was without the tabernacle, as Aben Ezra observes, and which was the
altar of burnt offering that stood within this court; for the particle
sometimes signifies "about" (s), and the word "around", being joined
with it, requires this sense:

and the cords of it; which seem to be the cords of the court, which
fastened the hangings and curtains to brass pins, or stakes fixed in the
ground to keep them tight, that the wind might not move them to and fro;
but Jarchi says, these were the cords of the tabernacle and tent, and
not of the court; and indeed the tabernacle had its cords as well as the
court, [Exo 38:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#018.md); the cords of the
court were in the charge of the Merarites, [Num

which the Gershonites had in their care and custody.

And of Kohath was the family of the Amramites,.... So called from Amram,
the first son of Kohath, and father of Aaron and Moses; so that Moses
and Aaron, and their children, are included in this family:

and the family of Izeharites; of which family was Korah, [Num
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#001.md),

and the family of the Hebronites, and the family of the Uzzielites;
which four families had their names from Kohath's four sons, [Num

In the number of all the males, from a month old and upwards, were eight
thousand and six hundred,.... 8,600 men, which was the largest number of
any of the houses of the Levites; but considering it had double the
number of families in it, the increase was not so large in proportion,
at least to Gershon, whose two families wanted but 1,100 of these four:

keeping the charge of the sanctuary; of the holy and most holy places,
and the vessels and instruments belonging thereunto; not that the males
of a month old were keeping them, but when they were grown up and were
capable of it, they had the charge thereof, in which they were
instructed and trained up from their youth.

The families of the sons of Kohath shall pitch on the side of the
tabernacle southward. Or to the right, which was the more honourable
place, excepting the east or front, which was reserved for Moses and
Aaron, and his sons, and who were one of these families; and is the
reason why this honour was conferred upon them, as well as they had the
more honourable charge, having the holy places and holy things committed
to their care; and one from among them was appointed over all the
Levites, and the chief of them, as they had also, when they came into
the land of Canaan, almost as many cities of refuge as both their other
brethren had: their situation about the tabernacle was between that and
the camp of Reuben, and this accounts for it, how Korah who was of one
of the families of the Kohathites, became so intimately acquainted with,
and joined in a conspiracy with Dathan and Abiram, who were of the tribe
of Reuben, [Num 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#001.md).

his brother Mishael, carried Nadab and Abihu out of the camp, and buried
them, [Lev 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#004.md); he descended from the
last and youngest of the families of the Kohathites; and some think this
was one reason at least of Korah's dissatisfaction, and of his entering
into a conspiracy against Moses and Aaron, because one of a younger
family of his house was preferred to this dignity before him.

And their charge shall be the ark,.... That is, when the tabernacle was
taken down, and carried from place to place, this, and the following
things, were committed to their care and custody, the ark with the mercy
seat, and all appertaining thereunto, which were in the holy of holies:

and the table, and the candlestick, and the altars; the table of
shewbread, and the candlestick of pure gold, with its lamps, and the
altar of incense, all which stood in the holy place, and the altar of
burnt offering, which was in the court, for both altars were their
charge:

and the vessels of the sanctuary wherewith they minister; all the
vessels which belonged to the above things; for the table, candlestick,
and altars, all had vessels appertaining to them:

and the hanging; that is, the vail, as Jarchi interprets it, which
divided between the, holy and the most holy place; all the other
hangings for the court, and the door of it, and for the door of the
tabernacle, were the charge of the Gershonites, [Num

Merarites:

and have the oversight of them that keep the charge of the sanctuary;
the Kohathites, who had the care of the things belonging to the holy and

is, of the Merarites, "the father to the families of Merari"; the common
father to them all, having the chief authority and power over them, and
so in [Num 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#024.md),

shall be Zuriel the son of Abihail; of whom we read nowhere else, nor is

And under the custody and charge of the sons of Merari shall be the
boards of the tabernacle,.... Both of the holy and the most holy place,
which were the walls of the tabernacle, and which were covered with
curtains; these when taken down for journeying were committed to the
care of the Merarites; and because these, with what, follow, were a
heavy carriage, they were allowed wagons to carry them; and who on this
account had more wagons given them than to the Gershonites, for the
Kohathites had none, [Num 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#006.md),

and the bars thereof; which kept the boards tight and close, see [Exo

divided between the holy and most holy place, and, on which the hanging

which was the entrance into the tabernacle:

even before the tabernacle of the congregation eastward; that is, before
the court of the tabernacle, where the people assembled together:

shall be Moses, Aaron, and his sons; Moses the chief ruler, and Aaron
the high priest, and his sons priests under him; these had the most
honourable place of all, beings at the front of the tabernacle, between
that and the camp of Judah. There is an extraordinary prick on the word
Aaron, to show, as Jarchi says, that he was not in the number of
Levites, though of the tribe of Levi, being high priest:

keeping the charge of the sanctuary, for the charge of the children of
Israel; either in their room and stead, which otherwise they must have
kept; or rather for their safety and security, keeping out all persons
from entering into the sanctuary, who had no business there, that they
died not, as it follows:

and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death; that is,
whoever came nigh to enter into the holy place, and did, who was no
priest, though an Israelite, and even a Levite, or into the most holy
place, excepting the high priest, it was death unto him, either by the
civil magistrate, or by the hand of heaven; so the Targum of Jonathan.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">num 3:39</span></span>

All that were numbered of the Levites, which Moses and Aaron,

numbered at the commandment of the Lord, throughout their families,....
Whence it appears, that Moses was not alone, but Aaron with him, in
numbering the Levites, and that by the appointment of the Lord. The word
"Aaron", in the Hebrew text, has a dot on every letter, for what reason
it is not certain; the word itself is left out in the Samaritan and
Syriac versions:

all the males, from a month old and upward, were twenty and two
thousand; 22,000 men; but by putting the sums together they amount to
three hundred more; for of the Gershonites there were 7,500, and of the
Kohathites 8,600, and of the Merarites 6,200, in all 22,300; which
difficulty some endeavour to remove by saying, as Aben Ezra observes,
that the Scripture takes a short way, mentioning the thousands, and
leaving out the hundreds but this, he says, is not right, nor is it the
way of the Scripture in this chapter: and in an after account of the
firstborn of the Israelites, not only the hundreds are mentioned, but
the broken number of seventy three. Others think there is a corruption
crept into the text somewhere in the particular numbers, through the
inadvertency of some copyist; and suppose it to be in the number of the
Kohathites, where they fancy six, is put instead of three: but there is
no occasion to suppose either of these, for which there is no
foundation, since the reason why three hundred are left out in the sum
total may be, because there were so many firstborn among the Levites,
and these could not be exchanged for the firstborn of the other tribes;
they, as such, being the Lord's, and one firstborn could not redeem
another; and so it is said in the Talmud (t), these three hundred were
firstborn, and there is no firstborn redeems a firstborn, or frees from
the redemption price of five shekels.

number all the firstborn of the children of Israel, from a month old and

I am the Lord; who has a right to all, and can claim who he pleases for
himself in a special manner, and therefore could and did take the
Levites to himself:

instead of the firstborn among the children of Israel; these he had
taken to him before, and ordered to be sanctified unto him, and for whom
a redemption price was paid to his priests for the support of them, and
the tabernacle service, and now it was his will to make an exchange of
these for the Levites:

and the cattle of the Levites, instead of all the firstling among the
cattle of the children of Israel: every firstling of clean cattle was
the Lord's, and given to his priests, and the firstlings of unclean
cattle were redeemed with a lamb, and which were given to the same; and
now instead of these he requires the cattle of the Levites; not that
they should be deprived of their use of them, or that they should be
taken and sacrificed, but that they should be with them devoted to him,
and they should possess them in his right.

of those that were numbered of them were twenty and two thousand two

he bids Moses take them, who had numbered them, and give them to Aaron,
instead of the firstborn, whose numbers were also taken for this
purpose:

and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; but not to be
given to Aaron and his sons, or to the priests for their use, but to
remain with the Levites for their use, who were now separated from the
other tribes, and taken into the service of God; and as they were
dedicated to God, so their cattle likewise for their support as his
ministers:

and the Levites shall be mine; in a special manner his, being devoted to
his service:

I am the Lord; who had a right to do this, and expected to be obeyed in
it.

Levites enough to answer to them, and exchange for them:

of the two hundred and threescore and thirteen of the firstborn of the

of the Levites, as given, was but 22,000, [Num

firstborn of Israel were 22,273, [Num

Thou shall even take five shekels apiece the poll,.... Or head; every
firstborn, or his parent for him, was bound to pay five shekels, which
were about eleven or twelve shillings of our money, and which was
afterwards settled as the price of such a redemption, [Num
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#016.md),

after the shekel of the sanctuary shall thou take them; being full
weight according to the standard there kept:

And thou shalt give the money, wherewith the odd number of them is to be
redeemed,.... Or the superfluous number, the number of them that
exceeded the Levites, namely, two hundred seventy three; the price of
their redemption is ordered to be given

unto Aaron, and to his sons; since the Levites were taken in lieu of the
firstborn, whose redemption money belonged to the priests; and seeing
the Levites were given to Aaron and his sons on that consideration, and
there being a deficiency of them to answer to the firstborn, it was but
right and just that the redemption price of the superfluous number
should be paid to them.

And Moses took the redemption money,.... Of five shekels per head:

of them that were over and above redeemed by the Levites; or were more
than those redeemed by them. A Levite redeemed a firstborn, or freed him
from the redemption price, being taken in lieu of him: 22,000 Levites
were answerable to 22,000 firstborn of Israel; but as there were no more
Levites than the above number, there remained two hundred seventy three
firstborn to be redeemed by money, and it was the redemption money of
these Moses took.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">num 3:50</span></span>

Of the firstborn of the children of Israel took he the money,.... Or
"for the firstborn", as the Vulgate Latin version renders it, and so the
Hebrew particle is sometimes used (u); for children of a month old or
little more could not pay the money, but their parents for them, which
was paid by them, and Moses received it for the superfluous number of
two hundred seventy three; but it is a matter of doubt of whom this was
exacted, and by whom paid, and who could be reckoned as this superfluous
number, unless they were the last two hundred seventy three that were
numbered: some have thought this was paid out of the public stock, which
was a ready way of doing it, but whether reasonable is not so manifest,
since these firstborn were the properties of particular persons; the
more commonly received method of doing it with the Jewish writers was,
according to Jarchi and Abarbinel, and so in the Talmud (w) by lot; the
former of which describes the manner of doing it thus, 22,000 pieces (of
paper or parchment) were brought, and on them written, "a son of Levi",
or "a Levite", and two hundred seventy three other pieces, and on them
were written, "five shekels"; these were mixed together and put into an
urn or box, and then they were bid to come and take out the pieces, and
according as the lot was, they were allowed as redeemed by the Levites,
or paid the redemption money: and as this was a method much in use with
the Hebrews, it is not improbable:

a thousand three hundred and threescore and five shekels, after the
shekel of the sanctuary; 1,365 shekels, which is exactly the number of
shekels that two hundred seventy three should pay, reckoning five
shekels per head; which Jarchi counts thus, for two hundred firstborn, a
thousand shekels; for seventy firstborn, three hundred fifty; and for
three firstborn fifteen, shekels, which in all amounted to about an
hundred seventy pounds of our money.

shekels a head:

unto Aaron and his sons; to whom the Levites were given; and this money,

the firstborn exchanged for them:

according to the word of the Lord; [Num

as the Lord commanded Moses; so did he, being a faithful servant in all
things in the house of God; he did not convert it to his own use, or to
any other use than to what God had appointed it.
