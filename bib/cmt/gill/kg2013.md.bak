[4 Kings (2 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg2 13:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO 2 KINGS 13

This chapter gives an account of the wicked reign of Jehoahaz son of
Jehu king of Israel, and of the low estate he was brought into by the
Syrians, [Kg2 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#001.md), and of the reign
of his son Joash, [Kg2 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#010.md), and of
the sickness and death of Elisha; of the visit Joash made him in his
sickness; and of his prediction of the king's success against the
Syrians; and of the reviving of a dead man cast into the prophet's
sepulchre, [Kg2 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#014.md) and of the
success of Joash against the Syrians, according to the prediction of the
prophet, [Kg2 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#022.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 13:1</span></span>

In the twenty and third year of Joash the son of Ahaziah king of
Judah,.... The same year he was so zealous and busy in repairing the
temple, [Kg2 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#006.md),

Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria; whereas
Joash began to reign in the seventh year of Jehu, and Jehu reigned but
twenty eight years, [Kg2 10:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#036.md), and
[Kg2 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#001.md), this could be but the
twenty first of Joash; to reconcile which it must be observed, that it
was at the beginning of the seventh year of Jehu that Joash began to
reign, and at the beginning of the twenty third of Joash that Jehoahaz
began to reign, as the Jewish commentators observe:

and reigned seventeen years; the two last of which were in common with
his son, as Junius, see

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 13:2</span></span>

And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord,.... Committed
idolatry:

and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to
sin; worshipping the golden calves:

he departed not therefrom; from the worship of them.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 13:3</span></span>

And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel,.... They doing as
their kings did:

and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into
the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, all their days; the word "their"
should not be supplied, since it was not true that Israel was delivered
into the hands of both those kings of Syria as long as they lived; for
they were delivered out of the hands of Benhadad, [Kg2
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#025.md), but the word "his" should be
inserted for it as to be understood of the days of Jehoahaz, see [Kg2
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#022.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 13:4</span></span>

And Jehoahaz besought the Lord, and the Lord hearkened unto him,.... He
did not apply in his distress to the calves he worshipped, but to the
Lord; who had a regard to his prayer, not for his sake, or any
righteousness of his, or even his repentance and humiliation, which were
only external; but for the sake of Israel, and because they were
oppressed, who were his people, and he their God, though they had sadly
departed from him:

for he saw the oppression of Israel; not only with his eye of
omniscience, but with an eye of mercy and compassion:

because the king of Syria oppressed them; by his incursions upon them,
and wars with them.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 13:5</span></span>

And the Lord gave Israel a saviour,.... Not an angel sent by him, nor a
captain raised up among them, nor the prophet Elisha, who predicted
their deliverance, nor Jehoahaz himself, but his son Joash, [Kg2
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#025.md).

so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians; were not in
subjection to them, nor harassed by them, nor in fear of them:

and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents, as before time; in
peace and safety.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 13:6</span></span>

Nevertheless, they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam,
who made Israel to sin, but walked therein,.... Continued to worship the
calves still, which was an instance of great ingratitude; the Syriac and
Arabic versions read, "he departed not"; Jehoahaz the king:

and there remained the grove in Samaria; which Ahab made there, [Kg1
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#033.md), neither Jehu nor his son had it
cut down, though Baal was destroyed.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 13:7</span></span>

Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen,....
This is to be connected with [Kg2
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#004.md), the verses [Kg2
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#005.md), being to be read in a
parenthesis, as in our version, and to be understood of the king of
Syria, who left no more to the king of Israel, not of the people of the
land, but of his army, than fifty horsemen, all the rest being either
taken and carried captive by him, or slain:

and ten chariots; military chariots, with the men they carried:

and ten thousand footmen; foot soldiers; to so small a number was his
army reduced through wars with the Syrians:

for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the
dust by threshing: as corn or chaff may be reduced to dust by too much
threshing; or as mire and clay by treading on it.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 13:8</span></span>

Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his
might,.... Which he exerted against the Syrians, being a man of courage,
though not successful, because the Lord was not with him, but against
him:

are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
Israel? where their acts, and the events of their reigns, were recorded.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 13:9</span></span>

And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers,.... Died, as they did:

and they buried him in Samaria; where Omri, and all the kings of Israel,
that descended from him, were buried:

and Joash his son reigned in his stead; of whom a short account is given
in the following verses.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 13:10</span></span>

In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah, began Jehoash the
son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria,.... But inasmuch as his
father began to reign in the twenty third of Joash, and reigned
seventeen years, [Kg2 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#001.md) this king
must begin to reign in the thirty ninth or fortieth of Joash; for the
reconciling of which it may be observed, that two of the years of his
reign may be supposed to be imperfect; or rather that his son reigned
two or three years in his lifetime, being raised up before his father's
death to be a saviour of Israel from the Syrians; and so his father
lived to see his prayer answered, [Kg2
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#004.md),

and reigned sixteen years.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 13:11</span></span>

And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord,.... As his
father did, and his character is described in the same words, see [Kg2
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#002.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 13:12</span></span>

And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did,.... Though none
of his acts as yet are recorded, but his sinful ones:

and his might; or valiant actions in war with the Syrians, [Kg2
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#025.md),

and wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah; of which there is
an account in the following chapter:

are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
Israel? in the history of the transactions of their reigns.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 13:13</span></span>

And Joash slept with his fathers,.... Or died:

and Jeroboam sat upon his throne; who was his son; it is not said that
he began to sit on it, or to reign, nor to reign in his father's stead;
hence it is concluded, as by Kimchi and others, that his father set him
on his throne in his lifetime; and the Jewish chronology (l) expressly
asserts that he reigned with him one year:

and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; see [Kg2
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#009.md), the history of his life and
actions does not cease here, but, after an account of the sickness and
death of Elisha, it is reassumed, which was necessary to interpose to
lead on to it.

\(l\) Seder Olam Rabba, c. 19.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 13:14</span></span>

Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died,.... The
prophets do not live for ever; this sickness was unto death; Elisha
died, and was not translated as Elijah was:

and Joash the king came down unto him; from his palace to the prophet's
house, to visit him in his sickness; which was an instance of great
condescension and respect, and especially in a wicked prince that could
not be reformed by him:

and wept over his face; held his head over him, and wept, perceiving he
was near his end, and sensible that his death would be a public loss;
the nation having often reaped the benefit of his prayers, though his
counsel and advice were neglected and despised:

and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the
horsemen thereof; the same words Elisha said to Elijah, as he went up to
heaven, which very probably Joash had heard of; See Gill on [Kg2
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#012.md), and here, as there, the Targum
is,"my master, my master, who was better to Israel by his prayers than
chariots and horsemen.''

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 13:15</span></span>

And Elisha said unto him, take bow and arrows,.... The usual instruments
of war in those days: and he took unto him bow and arrows; which though
they might not be had in the house of the prophet, he could have some
from his guards that attended him.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 13:16</span></span>

And he said unto the king of Israel, put thine hand upon the bow, and he
put his hand upon it,.... His left hand:

and Elisha put his hands upon the king's hands; on both his hands, which
were put, the one on the bow, the other on the arrow (m); hereby
signifying, that though the king would draw the bow in battle, the Lord,
whom the prophet represented, would give the success; and that it would
be by his help, and through his blessing on his arms, that he would
obtain victory over his enemies.

\(m\) See Virgil. Aeneid. 11. ver. 831, 862.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 13:17</span></span>

And he said, open the window eastward,.... Syria lying east of the land
of Israel, as the Jewish commentators in general observe, and for which
they quote [Isa 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#012.md), but it lay
northeast, or rather more to the north; wherefore this may respect the
eastward part of the land of Israel, which the Syrians had got
possession of, and should be recovered, as this sign showed, see [Kg2
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#033.md),

and he opened it: then Elisha said, shoot, and he shot; the arrow, out
of the window, being opened:

and he said, the arrow of the Lord's deliverance, and the arrow of
deliverance from Syria; meaning, that that arrow was a sign of the
Lord's deliverance of Israel from the Syrians, by whom they had been
sadly oppressed, and reduced very low:

for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek till thou hast consumed them;
not the whole nation, but that army they should bring thither; which was
a city in the land of Israel, where the Syrians were routed in Ahab's
time; 100,000 were slain near it on one day, and 27,000 by the fall of
the wall of it, [Kg1 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#026.md) hence some
read the words here, "as in Aphek."

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 13:18</span></span>

And he said, take the arrows, and he took them,.... The rest of them:

and he said unto the king of Israel, smite upon the ground; the floor of
the room in which the prophet lay:

and he smote thrice, and stayed; made a stop, ceased smiting; he might
think this action trifling, and beneath him, only was willing to please
the prophet, but did not do it with a good will, and therefore smote no
more; though this was an emblem of his smiting the Syrians, which he
might not understand.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 13:19</span></span>

And the man of God was wroth with him,.... Because he ceased smiting,
and smote no oftener; for it was revealed to the prophet, by an impulse
upon his mind, that by the number of times he smote on the ground, it
would be known how often he should get the victory over his enemies; but
this was to be left to the king's own will, how often he would smite,
and thereby the prophet would know also with what spirit he would pursue
his victories, and the advantages he would gain:

and said, thou shouldest have smitten five or six times, then hadst thou
smitten Syria until thou hadst consumed it; as a nation, as well as
routed their several armies:

whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice; beat them only three
times in battle, according to the number of his smitings on the ground.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 13:20</span></span>

And Elisha died, and they buried him,.... In Samaria. Epiphanius says
(n), in Sebastopolis of Samaria, Samaria itself was called Sebaste in
later times; though the Jews say (o) he was buried in Mount Carmel, in
the cave of Elijah; according to the Jewish chronology (p), he died in
the tenth year of Joash, and he prophesied more than sixty years; sixty
six, as Abarbinel, since he began to prophesy in the nineteenth year of
Jehoshaphat; and, according to Clemens (q) of Alexandria, when he was
forty years of age; but it seems rather, as Kimchi observes, that he
died in the beginning of the reign of Joash, and even before his
father's death, when he was a partner with him in the throne, and before
any salvation or deliverance from the Syrians was wrought:

and the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the
year; at the spring of the year, when there was fruit on the earth,
those troops of robbers came to plunder and spoil; several of the Jewish
writers observe, that in the word for "coming", is instead of and so may
be rendered "in that year", in that selfsame year that Elisha died; and
so read the Syriac, Arabic, and the Vulgate Latin versions.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 13:21</span></span>

And it came to pass, as they were burying a man,.... That is, as they
were going to bury him; for as yet they were not come to the place they
designed to bury him at, as appears by what follows:

that, behold, they spied a band of men; one of the bands of the
Moabites, which came to rob and plunder, and which was about the place
where they intended to bury the man; or they supposed would be there by
that time they got to it, or at least before they could bury him, and
therefore being frightened stopped:

and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha; that being nearest,
they opened it, or rather rolled away the stone from it, and threw the
body in great haste:

and when the man was let down, and touched the bone's of Elisha; or
"went and touched" (r); that is, as Kimchi interprets it, being cast in,
he rolled till he came to the body of the prophet, and touched it:

he revived, and stood upon his feet; which might serve to confirm the
faith of Joash in the predictions of the prophet concerning his
victories; is a proof of the resurrection of the dead, and of eternal
life, and an emblem of our being quickened through the death of Christ.
The Jews say (s) this man was Shallum the son of Tikvah, and husband of
Huldah the prophetess, and was a good man, much given to alms, for which
he was rewarded; and they further say, he went to his own house, and
lived many years, and begat children, and particularly Hananeel,
mentioned in [Jer 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#007.md), which is not
likely; though others say (t) he was a wicked man, Zedekiah the son of
Chenaanah, [Kg1 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#024.md) and therefore
not suffered to continue in the prophet's grave; but the former is more
probable; and, according to Josephus (u), it was the band of robbers
that left this man, whom they had murdered, in the grave of Elisha. This
grave seems to have been in the field, where the Jews of old, and in
later times, buried, as in the field of Hebron, the potter's field, &c.
so the Greeks, as Pausanias relates (w), and the Romans also (x), buried
by the wayside.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg2 13:22</span></span>

But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz. That
he reigned alone, at least, before he took his son Joash to reign with
him.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 13:23</span></span>

And the Lord was gracious to them,.... To Israel, notwithstanding their
apostasy from him, and the idolatry of the calves they were guilty of:

and had compassion on them; being in oppression and distress:

and had respect unto them; looked upon them with an eye of pity and
mercy:

because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; made so long ago
he still remembered:

and would not destroy them, neither cast he them from his presence as
yet; or suffered them to be carried captive into another land, as he
afterwards did in the times of Hoshea.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg2 13:24</span></span>

So Hazael the king of Syria died, and Benhadad his son reigned in his
stead. This was Benhadad the third; the first of this name was of the
Damascene kings; but though the kingdom was now in another family, yet
this name, being respectable with the Syrians, was retained in it.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 13:25</span></span>

And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Benhadad
the son of Hazael the cities which he had taken out of the hand of
Jehoahaz his father by war,.... Which were in the countries of Gilead
and Bashan, and belonged to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh,
[Kg2 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#033.md),

three times did Joash beat him: in so many pitched battles, but where is
not said, no doubt one of them was in Aphek, at least, [Kg2
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#017.md), and perhaps the other two on
the other side Jordan; this agrees with the three times he smote the
ground, significant thereof, [Kg2
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#018.md).

and recovered the cities of Israel; those before mentioned; otherwise,
if those had not been recovered, not ten tribes, only seven and a half,
would have been carried captive by the king of Assyria; whereas Josephus
(y) says expressly, the ten tribes were carried captive.
