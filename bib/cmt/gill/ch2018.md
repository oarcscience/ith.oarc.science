### [2 Chronicles Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 18:1</span></span>

Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance,.... Still more and
more, see [Ch2 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#005.md), and which moved
Ahab to desire friendship and affinity with him, to which Jehoshaphat
agreed:

and joined affinity with Ahab; king of Israel, married his son Joram to
Athaliah, a daughter of Ahab by Jezebel of Zidon; which marriage proved
of bad consequence to Jehoshaphat and his family.

[2 Chronicles 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 18:2</span></span>

And after certain years,.... Two years, according to the Syriac and
Arabic versions, or in the third year after the affinity was contracted,
see [Kg1 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#002.md),

he went down to Ahab to Samaria; to pay him a visit upon the alliance,
civil and matrimonial, contracted between them:

and Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people
that he had with him; entertained him and his retinue in a very grand
and liberal manner:

and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramothgilead; from hence, to the
end of the chapter, it is the same with [Kg1
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#004.md).
