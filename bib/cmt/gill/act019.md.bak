### [Acts Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#001.md)

[Acts 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 19:1</span></span>

And it came to pass that while Apollos was at Corinth,.... Whither he
came after the Apostle Paul, and where he watered what the apostle had
planted, and where he became very famous and eminent; insomuch that he
was set up, though not with his will, at the head of a party, in
opposition to the chief of the apostles, Peter and Paul; see [Co1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#012.md).

Paul having passed through the upper coasts; that is, of Phrygia,
Galatia, Pontus, Bithynia, Lydia, Lycaonia, and Paphlagonia;

came to Ephesus; into Ionia, of which Ephesus was the chief city, and
lay near the sea; wherefore the other countries are called the upper
coasts; hither he came, according to his promise in [Act
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#021.md)

And finding certain disciples; such as believed in Christ, made a
profession of him, and had been baptized in his name, for such were
commonly called disciples: these do not seem to be persons, who were
either converted by Paul, when he was at Ephesus before, or by Apollos,
who had been there since, and was gone; but rather some who came hither
from other parts, since the apostle was at this place; though indeed his
stay at Ephesus before was so short, that they might be here, and he not
hear of them, or meet with them.

[Acts 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 19:2</span></span>

He said unto them, have ye received the Holy Ghost,.... Meaning, not the
special regenerating and sanctifying grace of the Holy Ghost, for that
is supposed in their being disciples and believers, but the
extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost, for it follows,

since ye believed? that is, in Christ; which is taking it for granted,
that they had received the special grace of the Spirit of God; for this
believing is to be understood of true, spiritual, special faith in
Christ:

and they said unto him, we have not so much as heard whether there be
any Holy Ghost; by which they could not mean the person of the Holy
Ghost: for they must have known that there was such a divine person as
the Holy Ghost, from the writings of the Old Testament, with which they
were conversant: and from the ministry of John, into whose baptism they
were baptized; who saw the Spirit of God descend on Jesus, and bore
witness of it; and declared, that Christ who was to come after him,
would baptize with the Holy Ghost: nor could they mean the special grace
of the Spirit, which they themselves had received; but the extraordinary
gifts of the Spirit of God, which they at present knew nothing of, and
which were afterwards bestowed upon them: they knew that there were
prophecies in the Old Testament, concerning the effusion of the Spirit
in the last days, in the days of the Messiah; but they had not heard
that these had had their accomplishment; they had heard nothing of the
day of Pentecost, and of the pouring out of the Spirit upon the apostles
then, nor of any instance of this kind since; they did not know that the
Holy Ghost was yet, [Joh 7:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#039.md) they
knew he was promised, but not that he was given; the Ethiopic version,
to avoid the difficulty of the text, renders it, "we have only heard
that there was an Holy Ghost".

[Acts 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 19:3</span></span>

And he said unto them, unto what then were ye baptized?.... The apostle
takes it for granted that they were baptized, since they were not only
believers, but disciples; such as not only believed with the heart, but
had made a profession of their faith, and were followers of Christ; but
asks unto what they were baptized; either in whose name they were
baptized, since Christian baptism was administered in the name of the
Spirit, as well as in the name of the Father and of the Son; or what
attended or followed their baptism, seeing sometimes the Holy Ghost fell
upon persons, either before baptism, or at it, or after it:

and they said, unto John's baptism; some think they had never been
baptized at all with water baptism, only had received the doctrine
preached by John, concerning repentance and remission of sins, and so
were baptized unto him, professing the same doctrine he did, just as the
Israelites were baptized into Moses; others think they were baptized,
but very wrongly, being baptized in the name of John, and not in the
name of Jesus Christ; and so, as it was not Christian baptism they had
submitted to, it was right to baptize them again: but neither of these
are probable, for it is not likely that they should receive John's
doctrine, and not his baptism; that they should be his disciples and
followers, and not attend to the more distinguishing branch of his
ministry; and it is still more unlikely that they should be baptized in
his name, who preached Jesus Christ to his followers, and pointed out to
them the Lamb of God, and declared him to be greater than he; it seems
rather that they were baptized, and that they were baptized in the name
of Christ, as John's disciples were, as the apostle affirms in the
following words.

[Acts 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 19:4</span></span>

Then said Paul,.... In reply to their answer, understanding them that
they were baptized by John, he takes it up, and gives an account of
John's baptism: showing how agreeable it was, and that it was the same
baptism with the baptism of Christ, being administered in his name:

John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance; which required
repentance antecedent to it, and was a fruit and effect, and so an
evidence of it:

saying unto the people; the people of the Jews, the common people, the
multitude that attended on his ministry:

that they should believe on him, which should come after him, that is,
on Jesus Christ; so that he preached faith in Christ, as well as
repentance towards God; and made the one as well as the other a
necessary prerequisite unto baptism; which shows, that his baptism and
Christian baptism are the same.

[Acts 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 19:5</span></span>

When they heard this,.... That is, the people to whom John preached, his
hearers; when they heard of the Messiah, and that Jesus was he, and that
it became them to believe in him:

they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus; not the disciples that
Paul found at Ephesus, but the hearers of John; for these are the words
of the Apostle Paul, giving an account of John's baptism, and of the
success of his ministry, showing, that his baptism was administered in
the name of the Lord Jesus; and not the words of Luke the Evangelist,
recording what followed upon his account of John's baptism; for then he
would have made mention of the apostle's name, as he does in the next
verse; and have said, when they heard this account, they were baptized
by Paul in the name of the Lord Jesus: the historian reports two things,
first what Paul said, which lies in [Act
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#004.md) then what he did, [Act
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#006.md) where he repeats his name, as was
necessary; as that he laid his hands upon them, which was all that was
needful to their receiving the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost,
having been already baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus: which sense
is the more confirmed by the particles and which answer to one another
in verses 4 and 5, and show the words to be a continuation of the
apostle's speech, and not the words of the historian, which begin in the
next verse. Beza's ancient copy adds, "for the remission of sins".

[Acts 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 19:6</span></span>

And when Paul had laid his hands upon them,.... They having been before
baptized, not by him, but by John, or one of his disciples, in the name
of the Lord Jesus; just as Peter and John laid their hands upon the
believing Samaritans, who had been before baptized by Philip, [Act
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#014.md) and the same extraordinary
effects followed:

the Holy Ghost came on them; in his extraordinary gifts, whose special
grace they had before an experience of:

and they spake with tongues; with other tongues, or in other languages,
which they had never learned, or had been used to, as the disciples did
at the day of "Pentecost": and prophesied; preached, having an
extraordinary gift at once, of explaining the prophecies of the Old
Testament, and also foretold things to come.

[Acts 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 19:7</span></span>

And all the men were about twelve. The Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic
versions, have not the word "about"; but affirm, that the men were
twelve; and indeed the number being so small, the historian might be at
a certainty about it: these seem to be the first materials of a Gospel
church at Ephesus, which afterwards was very large and flourishing, and
very likely were some of the elders of it.

[Acts 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 19:8</span></span>

And he went into the synagogue,.... Of the Jews at Ephesus, for it seems
to have been a private house, where he had met with the twelve baptized
disciples, and had laid his hands on them; and these being Jews, as it
seems most likely, by their having been baptized into John's baptism,
the apostle went along with them to the synagogue on the sabbath day, as
was his usual custom; having a very great desire, and an affectionate
concern, for the welfare of his countrymen the Jews:

and spake boldly for the space of three months; that is, he used great
freedom of speech, and showed much courage and intrepidity of mind, in
preaching the Gospel at the synagogue every sabbath day as it returned,
during this space of time; some manuscripts read, "three days":

disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God; the
kingdom of the Messiah, the Gospel dispensation, the doctrines and
ordinances of the Gospel, and the Gospel church state, often signified
by the kingdom of God, and of heaven, in Scripture; and concerning the
glory of a future state, the way and right unto it, and meetness for it;
and these things he reasoned upon in such a strong and nervous manner,
and made use of such powerful arguments, in proof and demonstration of
them, as were very persuasive, and engaged many to believe them, and
give their assent unto them.

[Acts 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 19:9</span></span>

But when divers were hardened and believed not,.... For though some were
affected with and convinced by the arguments the apostle used, others
were but the more hardened and remained incredulous: for the Gospel,
while it is the savour of life unto life to some, it is the savour of
death unto death, to others; as the sun melts the wax, and hardens the
clay:

but spake evil of the way before the multitude; the Syriac version and
Beza's ancient copy read, "before the multitude of the Gentiles": the
unbelieving Jews not only contradicted the Gospel preached by the
apostle, but blasphemed it, and said all the evil things of it they
could, and loaded it with reproaches, and charged it with all the bad
consequences they could think of; and that publicly, before all the
people, in order to prejudice them against it; for by "the way", is
meant the doctrine of the Gospel, which the Vulgate Latin here reads,
"the way of the Lord"; and so some copies; and two of Stephens's copies
read, "the way of God", as does also the Syriac version; and the Arabic
version, "the way of faith"; and the Ethiopic version, "the doctrine";
the doctrine, which shows the way of God's salvation by Jesus Christ:

he departed from them; the hardened, unbelieving, and blaspheming Jews,
as being unworthy of the means of grace; he went out of their synagogue,
and no more entered there: and separated the disciples; from them, the
twelve disciples he had laid his hands on, and others who in this space
of time, the space of three months, had been converted under his
ministry; these he formed into a separate Gospel church state, as well
as engaged them to quit the company and conversation of these
blasphemers, and no more attend with them in their synagogue, that so
they might not be infected and corrupted by them; a separation from such
who contradict and blaspheme the truths and ordinances of the Gospel, is
justifiable:

disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus: which was either built by
him, and so went by his name, or which one of this name possessed, and
made use of; for it seems to be the proper name of a man, and so the
Syriac version renders it, "whose name was Tyrannus"; though by others
it is taken to be an appellative, and to design some great person, who
patronised the apostle, and in whose house he taught; the word "tyrant",
being formerly used for a king, a prince, or nobleman; and so the Arabic
version renders it, "in the dwelling house of one of the great men"; the
chief of Asia, that were his friends, [Act
19:31](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#031.md) and so the Ethiopic version,
"and he taught daily before the court and the governors": some copies
read "Tyrannius"; mention is made of a philosopher whose name was
"Tyrannion", who was so called, because he vexed and disturbed those
that were brought up in the same school with him (f); this man it seems
was a schoolmaster; there was one of his name a bishop of Tyre, a martyr
under Dioclesian; and another whose name was Tyrannus, bishop of Antioch
(g); Beza's ancient copy, and one of Stephens's, add, "from the fifth
hour to the tenth"; as if he spent five hours in public teaching every
day, and rest in his trade and devotion.

[Acts 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 19:10</span></span>

And this continued by the space of two years,.... Reckoning from the end
of the three months, which had been spent in teaching in the synagogue:

so that all they which dwelt in Asia; in the lesser Asia, called the
proconsular Asia, of which Ephesus was the chief city:

heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks; these, as they
came to Ephesus, whether on account of religion, the Asiatic Jews to
their synagogue, and the Greeks or Gentiles to the famous temple of
Diana, or on account of trade and business, or for the sake of seeing
this place, had the opportunity of hearing the Apostle Paul preach,
concerning the person, offices, and grace of Christ; and dispute and
reason concerning the more abstruse and difficult points of the
Christian religion, in the above school, for two years together; so that
the word of the Lord went out from hence, and was spread in all the
cities and towns in Asia.

[Acts 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 19:11</span></span>

And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul. For the
confirmation of the doctrine which he preached, and of his mission, as
an apostle; and these were not any sort of miracles, common and vulgar
ones, and much less things of chance, and what were merely accidental,
as the word may signify; but they were rare and uncommon ones, and in
which there was a visible display of the power of God; to whom as the
efficient cause they are ascribed, the apostle being only an instrument
God made use of.

[Acts 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 19:12</span></span>

So that from his body were brought unto the sick,.... The Ethiopic
version renders it, "from the extremity", or "border of his garment";
and the Syriac version, "from the garments which were upon his body";
were brought and put upon the sick; that is, of the clothes which the
apostle wore, some of them were taken and carried to sick persons, and
used by them: particularly "handkerchiefs" or "aprons"; the former were
such as he might use to wipe his face with, and remove sweat, or any
filth from the body; and the latter, what he might wear as a mechanic,
when working at his trade:

and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of
them; who were afflicted and possessed with them; these were some of the
special and uncommon miracles wrought by the hands of the apostle, and
which were wrought in an uncommon way; and which most clearly showed
that they were wrought by a divine power.

[Acts 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 19:13</span></span>

Then certain of the vagabond Jews,.... Who strolled about from place to
place, pretending to tell fortunes, cure diseases by charms, and
dispossess devils by conjuration, and therefore are called as follows,

exorcists; such there were among the Jews, as Justin Martyr observes
(h), who adjured by the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: these

took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits, the name of the
Lord Jesus; they imitated the Apostle Paul, and attempted to do as he
did, using the same: name; hoping to get money or applause, or both, in
this way; and it may be observed, that there were some who really did
cast out devils in the name of Christ, who did not belong to him, [Mat
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#022.md)

Saying, we adjure you by Jesus, whom Paul preacheth; that is, to come
out the bodies of those men which they had possessed: and the Jews made
use of the name of Jesus for healing diseases; for it is said of one
(i), that

"he swallowed something which almost choked him, and one came, and
muttered to him in the name of Jesus ben Pandira, and he was well''

The Alexandrian copy, Beza's ancient one, and others, the Vulgate Latin
and Syriac versions, read, "I adjure you", &c.

[Acts 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 19:14</span></span>

And there were seven sons of one Sceva a Jew,.... Who strolled about the
country, and used exorcisms: and

chief of the priests; that were at Ephesus; not the high priest of the
Jews, for he would have been at Jerusalem, and not at Ephesus; though
indeed it does not necessarily follow from the words, that Sceva himself
was there, only his seven sons: however, no such name appears in the
catalogue of the Jewish high priests, nor is it reasonable to think,
that seven sons of an high priest should follow such a vagabond course
of life: Beza's ancient copy only calls him "a priest"; and the
Alexandrian copy reads his name, Sceuta, and the Ethiopic version omits
it; it is the same with and signifies a spectator, or observer; see the
Targum on [Sa2 13:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#034.md).

which did so; adjured the devils in the name of Jesus, to come out; at
least they did so in one case, as follows.

[Acts 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 19:15</span></span>

And the evil spirit answered and said,.... The Alexandrian copy, the
Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions, add, "to them"; to the
seven sons of Sceva:

Jesus I know; to be the Son of God and Messiah, and own that he has
power of dispossessing spirits, of which there were many instances in
the days of his flesh:

and Paul I know; and own to be a servant of the most high God, by whom
miracles of this kind have been wrought:

but who are ye? you are not the disciples of Jesus, nor the servants of
God, but the children of the devil, and have no power over us, but on
the other hand are subject to us.

[Acts 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 19:16</span></span>

And the man in whom the evil spirit was,.... Being agitated by him:

leapt upon them; with great agility and force, and laid hold on them,
and struggled with them, and beat and wounded them, and stripped them
naked:

and overcame them, and prevailed against them; the Alexandrian copy,
Beza's most ancient one, and some others, and the Vulgate Latin version
read, "and overcame both"; as if only two of these seven sons had made
this attempt, and were so used; though the Ethiopic version reads, "and
overcame them all"; all the seven sons:

so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded; having their
clothes tore off, and their bodies beat and bruised.

[Acts 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 19:17</span></span>

And this was known to all the Jews,.... These men being Jews: and Greeks
also dwelling at Ephesus: for though it was done in a private house, yet
there might be many spectators and witnesses, both Jews and Greeks, who
spread this fact about the city, and who, were to be depended upon:

and fear fell on them all; on the enemies of Christ and his Gospel, so
that others were deterred from making such an attempt for the future:

and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified; which had such power over
evil spirits, and whose power they themselves acknowledged: this was
done by them that believed in Christ, who thought and spake the more
highly of him; and who more strongly believed in him, and so magnified
him, and gave more glory to him; Christ is great in himself, and he is
magnified and made great, when he is declared to be so, and is treated
as such.

[Acts 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 19:18</span></span>

And many that believed,.... In Jesus Christ, whose name was spoken of
with great respect, and which spread fear in every person:

came; to the apostle:

and confessed; their sins; and acknowledged what a wicked life they had
led:

and showed their deeds; their former evil deeds, which they had been
guilty of; one copy reads, "their sins"; see [Mat
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#006.md).

[Acts 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 19:19</span></span>

Many also of them which used curious arts..... Magic arts, soothsaying,
necromancy, conjuration, and the like, being convinced of the folly and
wickedness of them:

brought their books together; by which they had learned these arts;
Ephesus was famous for this sort of learning; here Apollonius Tyaneus,
in the beginning of Nero's reign, opened a school and taught magic, and
such like things: frequent mention is made of the Ephesian letters,
which were no other than enchantments; and even Diana, the goddess of
the Ephesians, is said to be a magician (k):

and burned them before all men; to show their detestation of them, and
the truth and genuineness of their repentance for their former sins; and
that these books might not be a snare to them for the future, nor be
made use of by others:

and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces
of silver; which is thought to answer to one thousand five hundred sixty
two pounds and ten shillings of our money; reckoning a piece of silver,
an Attic drachma; for such might be the silver pieces at Ephesus, a city
of Greece, and which was of the value of our money seven pence
halfpenny; but if Luke meant by pieces of silver, shekels, according to
the Jewish way; see Gill on [Mat 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#015.md)
then the sum is much larger, for a shekel was about two shillings and
six pence of our money; so that fifty thousand pieces of silver, amount
to six thousand two hundred and fifty pounds; a large sum indeed for
magic books! some manuscripts read "gold" instead of "silver", which
must greatly increase the value.

[Acts 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 19:20</span></span>

So mightily grew the word of God, and prevailed. Over conjuring books,
conjurers themselves, yea, even the devils; the power of God going along
with it, many were converted; which is meant by the increase of it, and
were delivered from the power of darkness, out of the hands of Satan,
and translated into the kingdom of Christ. Beza's ancient copy reads,
the "faith" of God; and the Syriac version, "faith in God".

[Acts 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 19:21</span></span>

After these things were ended,.... After that the apostle had disputed
with the Jews in their synagogue, for the space of three months, and in
the school of Tyrannus about two years; and after many souls had been
converted at Ephesus, and were formed into a church state, and were
established in the faith:

when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia: in the former of which
were the cities of Philippi, Thessalonica, and Berea, and in the latter,
Corinth; where the apostle had already been, and preached the Gospel
with success, and had laid the foundation of a Gospel church state in
each place; but was willing to visit them again, both to confirm them in
the doctrines of the Gospel, and, if it was the will of God, that he
might be the instrument of converting others, and adding them to them,
as well as to make some collections among them, for the poor saints at
Jerusalem: for through these places he intended

to go to Jerusalem; to visit the church there, and distribute to the
poor what he had gathered, or should gather for them among the Gentile
churches:

saying, after I have been there, I must also see Rome; the metropolis of
the empire, and the glory of the whole world; and which to see was one
of Austin's three wishes: but the apostle's desire was not so much to
see the magnificence of the city, as the saints in it; and that he might
impart some spiritual gift unto them, and have some fruit among them;
and be a means of quickening and comforting them, and of gaining others
to them; and it was the will of God that he should go there; and this he
spake by a prophetic spirit, and as being under the impulse of the
Spirit of God; see [Act 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#011.md).

[Acts 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 19:22</span></span>

So he sent into Macedonia,.... To Philippi, or Thessalonica, or Berea,
or some of the places there, to let them know of his coming, and to
prepare for him:

two of them that ministered unto him; that were his assistants in
preaching the Gospel:

Timotheus and Erastus; the former of these was a disciple he found at
Lystra, and took along with him, and to whom he afterwards wrote two
epistles; and the latter seems to be the same with him, who was
chamberlain of the city of Corinth, and is said to abide there, [Rom
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#023.md) The Ethiopic version, instead of
Erastus, wrongly reads Aristarchus; whereas it is certain, he was not
sent into Macedonia, but was with the apostle at Ephesus in the tumult,
[Act 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#029.md).

But he himself stayed in Asia for a season; that is, at Ephesus, as the
following narration shows.

[Acts 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 19:23</span></span>

And the same time there arose no small stir about that way. The Syriac
version reads, "the way of God"; and the Vulgate Latin version, "the way
of the Lord": that is, the Christian religion, and the doctrines and
ordinances of the Gospel, which the saints were directed to walk in; and
the Ethiopic version renders it, "about this doctrine"; which mightily
grew and prevailed, and which such numbers embraced; and how great the
stir was about it, and from whence it arose, who began it, and what were
the consequences of it, are hereafter related.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 19:24</span></span>

For a certain man, named Demetrius, a silversmith,.... Who worked in
silver, not in coining silver money, but in making silver vessels, in
melting silver, and casting it into moulds, and forming it into
different shapes; and particularly,

which made silver shrines for Diana; who Diana was; see Gill on [Act
19:27](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#027.md), these were not coins or medals
of silver, struck by Demetrius, with the figure of the temple of Diana
on them, nor images of Diana, as the Ethiopic version reads; but they
were chaplets, or little temples made of silver, in imitation of the
temple of Diana at Ephesus, with her image included in it; the words may
be rendered, "silver temples": in some manuscripts it is added, "like
little chests": which being sold to the people,

brought no small gain to the craftsmen: who were of the same trade with
him; masters of the same business, who employed others under them, as
appears by what follows.

[Acts 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 19:25</span></span>

Whom he called together,.... That is, the craftsmen; "all his
co-artificers", as the Syriac version reads, all the chief of the trade,
the masters of it, as he himself was:

with the workmen of like occupation; who were employed by him, and the
rest of the masters in the several branches of the business; as
founders, engravers, polishers, &c. some might make the images, and
others the temples, or shrines; some do one part and some another, so
that abundance of persons might be employed in this business:

and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth; the
workmen not only had a comfortable and sufficient livelihood, but the
masters of the trade grew rich: such a demand had they for their goods,
and so profitable was this craft to them: this was a very strong and
moving argument, to influence the masters and workmen; it so nearly
touched them, and their worldly interest, than which nothing sticks
closer to carnal men. Demetrius's way of address was very moving and
persuasive, but his method manifestly betrayed what was his greatest
concern, not religion, but his own secular interest; that which he
should have mentioned last, if at all, he begins with: self is the
leading and governing principle in a natural man.

[Acts 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 19:26</span></span>

Moreover, ye see and hear,.... Demetrius appeals to their senses of
seeing and hearing; they saw what was done in their own city, and they
had heard how things were elsewhere; they might believe what they saw
with their eyes, and they had reason to depend upon the report which was
brought to their ears:

that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul
hath persuaded and turned away much people; by "all Asia" is meant
Ionia, that part of Asia, of which Ephesus was the metropolis; from
whence great multitudes came to Ephesus, and heard Paul in the school of
Tyrannus, [Act 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#010.md) so that not only
many in the city of Ephesus, but even in almost every city and town of
Asia, had heard and received the Gospel preached by Paul; of whom
Demetrius speaks very contemptibly, as if he was a worthless vagabond
fellow, who had the art of persuading and deluding people; he prevailed
upon them to believe in Christ whom he preached, and turned away much
people from the worshipping of idols, to the living God:

saying, that they be no gods which are made with hands; such as was
their Diana, and the images of her, which these workmen made; and
consequently if his doctrine prevailed, as it had much already, their
trade would be worth nothing, and their livelihood be lost, which was
the grand thing they had in view; for one would think they could never
believe themselves, that the images they made were really gods; but
whether they did or not, certain it is, that the apostle's doctrine was
true, that such could not be gods, and which agrees both with reason and
revelation.

[Acts 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 19:27</span></span>

So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought,.... Or
"to come into reproof", as the words may be literally rendered, and as
they are in the Vulgate Latin version; that is, if this notion prevails,
that they are not gods, which are made with hands, this art and business
of making shrines and images for Diana will be brought into contempt,
and come to nothing; who will buy them, when once they believe there is
no divinity in them? they will despise them, and the makers of them;
yea, the latter will be in danger of being taken up, and charged,
convicted, reproved and punished as idolaters, and blasphemers of deity;
to which sense the Ethiopic version inclines, which renders it, "and not
only for this thing we shall be in danger"; of being called to an
account for making these shrines; our business will be put down, and we
shall be treated with disgrace, if not with severity:

but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised;
here religion is pretended, and a concern shown for that; partly on
purpose to cover, as much as could be, the selfish and avaricious
principles from which Demetrius acted; and partly the more to stir up
the meaner and more ignorant sort of people, and irritate and provoke
them, and set them against Paul and his doctrine, who generally speaking
are the most bigoted. Diana is said to be the daughter of Jupiter, by
Latona; she is often called the goddess of hunting, and is said to
preside at births; the moon was worshipped by the Heathens under her
name; she is here called the "great" goddess, for the Gentiles had their
greater and their lesser gods, and she is reckoned among the former,
which were in number twelve; Juno, Vesta, Minerva, Ceres, Diana, Venus,
Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Neptune, Vulcan, and Apollo: the temple of Diana
at Ephesus is reckoned among the seven wonders of the world; it was
about seven furlongs distant from the city (l), and was 425 feet long,
and 220 feet broad, and had in it 127 pillars, 60 feet high; it was
built on marshy ground, that it might not be affected with earthquakes;
and yet that such a pile of building might not stand upon a slippery and
unstable foundation, coals and fleeces of wool were laid in the
foundation and trodden in it, according to Pliny (m), from whom this
account is taken; who says it was two hundred and twenty years in
building, and elsewhere he says it was four hundred years; the architect
who first began it, he makes to be one Chersiphron; but it is commonly
ascribed to the Amazons, and particularly to the Amazon Otrira, the wife
of Mars; though Pausanias (n), as he observes that the temple of Diana
of the Ephesians was built before the Ionians came into these parts, so
he denies that it was built by the Amazons, but affirms that the
builders of it were Cresus, and Ephesus, the son of Caystrus. Solinus
(o), who calls it a fabric of the Amazons, says it was

"so magnificent, that Xerxes, when he burnt all the temples in Asia,
spared this only; but (adds he) this clemency of Xerxes did not preserve
the sacred temple from evil; for Herostratus set fire to this noble
fabric with his own hands, for no other reason, as he confessed, than to
get himself a name.''

At which the Ephesians were so enraged, that they got an order published
by the common council of Asia, throughout all the neighbouring kingdoms
and nations, that his name should not be once mentioned (p); which
however, though it might be regarded for a while, was not always; for
his name has since been both spoken of, and transmitted in writing to
posterity. The above historian observes, that the temple at Ephesus was
burnt, the same day in which Alexander was born at Pella; which
occasioned Timaeus facetiously to say, as is related by Cicero (q).

"it is no wonder that the temple of Diana of the Ephesians should be
burnt the same night that Alexander was born, seeing Diana, being
desirous to be present at the delivery of Olympias, (the mother of
Alexander,) was absent from her own house.''

However, the inhabitants of Ephesus being very rich, and also willing to
communicate to the charge of rebuilding this edifice, the women even
bringing their gold, silver, and other precious ornaments, the work was
set about, and a fabric was raised much more beautiful than the former;
the name of the architect by whom it was rebuilt was Dinocrates; and so
it continued, to this time the apostle was at Ephesus, a very fine and
grand building, and commanded great attention, veneration, and respect
from men; and which Demetrius suggests would fall into contempt, through
the doctrine of the apostle, should he be suffered to go on:

and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world
worshippeth; by "her magnificence" is meant, her deity; which must be
denied her, as well as her temple despised, if Paul's doctrine was true,
and should obtain; so the Syriac version renders it, "the goddess
herself"; and the Ethiopic version, "her divinity": what Demetrius says
of her, that she was worshipped by all Asia, and the world, was fact;
not only all Asia was concerned in building her temple at Ephesus, as
many writers affirm (r); but she was one of the highest class of
deities, and received as such by the whole Gentile world; yea, Diana of
the Ephesians, as distinguished from all other Dianas, was revered by
all nations. There were temples of Diana of the Ephesians in other
places, particularly at Corinth, as Pausanias relates; and who also
affirms, that all the cities celebrate Diana of the Ephesians, and men
in private honour her above other deities; the reasons are, the glory of
the Amazons, from whom according to fame her image was, and because of
the antiquity of the temple: three other things besides these, adds he,
contribute to the glory of it; the magnificence of the temple, which
exceeds whatever was done by man, and the splendour of the city of the
Ephesians, and the renown of the deity in it (s): here the silversmith
suggests the catholicism and universality of their religion, in favour
of it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 19:28</span></span>

And when they heard these sayings,.... Both the masters and the workmen;

they were full of wrath; against Paul and his doctrine:

and cried out, saying, great is Diana of the Ephesians; this goddess is
frequently called in Heathen writers, Diana of the Ephesians, or the
Ephesian Diana, because of her famous temple at Ephesus; and to
distinguish her from all other Dianas: Pausanias makes mention of sixty
Dianas at least, and yet seems not to have taken notice of them all; all
of them had different epithets, by which they were distinguished from
one another; the images were in different shapes, and they were
worshipped with different rites: what seems most of all to distinguish
the Ephesian Diana from others, is her having many paps; hence she is
called, "multi mammia"; so Minutius Felix observes (t), that Diana is
sometimes girt about on high as an huntress, and the Ephesian Diana is
"mammis multis & uberibus extructa"; Just as the Isis of the Egyptians,
which, Macrobius (u) says, signifies the earth; hence the whole body of
the deity is covered with paps, because the whole universe is nourished
by it: the priest of Diana of the Ephesians was an eunuch, and was
obliged to abstain from all company; neither bathed, nor ate, nor drank
with others, nor might he enter into the house of a private person;
there was a feast kept every year in honour of her, at which young men
in the flower of their age, and virgins well dressed, used to go to the
temple in great pomp, keep the feast, and marry with each other. The
temple was a sort of an asylum, as Heathen temples commonly were; and it
had this particular privilege, that those that fled to it were freed
from servitude (w). This goddess is called "great", agreeably to her
name, for, "Diana", signifies "great" and venerable; because of her
birth, being the daughter of Jupiter; and because of her great service,
she was supposed to be of in assisting at births; and because of her
magnificent temple and worship; and because she was worshipped by great
persons: and here greatness is ascribed unto her, and a loud cry made of
it, to animate one another, to gather a mob together, and to incense
them and stir them up against the apostle and his companion: in the
Arabic version, instead of Diana, it is Venus, both here and elsewhere,
but wrongly.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 19:29</span></span>

And the whole city was filled with confusion,.... For the workmen that
made the silver shrines very likely ran up and down in the city, crying
out, great is Diana of the Ephesians, which brought the people out of
their houses to inquire what was the matter; and the mob gathering and
increasing, as they went along, threw the whole city into confusion and
disorder:

and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia; the latter of
these was of Thessalonica in Macedonia, as appears from [Act
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004.md) but of what place the former was,
is not certain; however, being a Macedonian, he could not be the Gaius
of Derbe, mentioned in the same place, nor the Gaius of Corinth, [Co1
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#014.md) but some third person. They are
both Greek names; Aristarchus signifies the chief of princes, or the
prince of chiefs; and Gaius is a name taken from the joy of parents, and
is the same with the Roman name, Caius; they are both reckoned among the
seventy disciples; the former is said to be bishop of Apamea in Phrygia,
and the latter Bishop of Ephesus; See Gill on [Luk
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001.md).

Paul's companions in travel; whom he brought with him out of Macedonia,
and who had been with him to Jerusalem and Antioch, and were now
returned with him to Ephesus, where they had been with him for the space
of two years, or more: it is very much that this mob had not seized on
Paul himself: it may be Paul was within doors, and these were without in
the streets, and so were laid hold upon and carried away in a most
forcible and violent manner by them: who having got them,

they rushed with one accord into the theatre; where the public plays
were acted in honour of the goddess Diana, and where, among other
things, men were set to fight with wild beasts; and very likely the
intention of the mob, in hurrying Paul's companions thither, was to
throw them to the wild beasts. A theatre is a spectacle or show, so
called, because in them fights were shown, plays were acted, games
exercised, and battles fought between men and men, and between men and
beasts, and between beasts and beasts; concerning which, take the
following account (x):

"Theatre, among the ancients, is a public edifice for the exhibiting of
scenic spectacles, or shows to the people--under the word theatre was
comprehended not only the eminence, whereon the actors appeared, and the
action passed, but also the whole area, or extent of the place common to
the actors and spectators: in this sense the theatre was a building
encompassed with porticos, and furnished with seats of stone, disposed
in semicircles, and ascending gradually over one another, which
encompassed a space called the "orchestra"; in the front whereof was the
"proscenium" or "pulpitum", whereon the actors performed the "scena", a
large front adorned with orders of architecture; behind which was
"postscenium", or the place where the actors made themselves ready,
retired, &c. so that the "scena", in its full extent, comprehended all
the part belonging to the actors. In the Greek theatres, the "orchestra"
made a part of the "scena"; but in the Roman theatres, none of the
actors ever descended into the "orchestra", which was taken up by the
seats of the senators.''

For the better understanding the terms used, and the several parts of
the theatre, let it be observed, that the "scena", according to others
(y) was the place from whence the actors first went out; and it reached
from one corner of the theatre to the other, and was threefold;
"tragical", which was adorned in a royal manner with pillars and signs;
"comical", which represented private buildings; and "satirical", which
exhibited trees, caves, mountains, &c. Likewise, the "scena" was either
"versile", when on a sudden the whole scene was turned by some machines;
or "ductile", when by drawing away the boards the inward face of the
scene appeared, or by drawing curtains. The "proscenium" was a place
lower than the scene, in which the actors chiefly spoke and acted: the
"postscenium" was a place in which these things were done, which could
not be done fitly, and with decorum in the scenes: the "pulpitum" was a
higher place in the "proscenium", in which those that recited stood: the
"orchestra" was the last place, in which they danced, and near which the
senators sat. Tarquinius Priscus was the first who introduced plays
among the Romans; and the temple of Bacchus at Athens was the first
theatre in the world, the remains of which are still to be seen. Of this
theatre at Ephesus I have not met with any account; whether it was in
the temple, or without, is not certain; very likely it might be a part
of it, or adjoin unto it.

And when Paul would have entered in unto the people,.... In the theatre,
in order to have preached to the people, and to have removed their
prejudices against him, and the Gospel preached by him, and to have
shown them the error and evil of their idolatrous ways and worship, and
to have reconciled them to him, and his friends, and to have persuaded
them to do them no hurt; which shows the apostle's greatness of soul,
his firmness, constancy, and intrepidity, and his great concern and
affection for his companions, to risk his life in this manner: but

the disciples suffered him not; the believers, the members of the church
at Ephesus would by no means agree to it, but dissuaded him from it; who
hereby, on their part, showed great love to him, and what a value they
had for him, and how much they esteemed the life of so great an apostle,
and faithful preacher of the Gospel. The Ethiopic version renders it,
"the apostles prohibited him"; but there were none of that office with
him.

[Acts 19:31](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 19:31</span></span>

And certain of the chief of Asia,.... Or the Asiarchs; these were not
princes of Asia, rulers or governors of provinces, or cities, or civil
magistrates; but priests who presided over the games and diversions at
the theatre, and had the management and command of things there. Such an
one was Philip the Asiarch, the church of Smyrna makes mention of in
their account of the sufferings and martyrdom of Polycarp (z), whom the
people entreated that he would send out the lion to Polycarp; that is,
out of the theatre which he had the command of; but he replied he could
not do it, because he had finished the theatrical exercises: from whence
it appears that he was the governor of the theatre, and had his title of
Asiarch from thence, as these men had, wherefore this word should not be
rendered, the "princes of Asia", as by the Vulgate Latin; nor the "chief
of Asia", as by the Syriac and Arabic versions, and by ours, but rather
the "Asian priests". The Ethiopic version not knowing who should be
meant by them, only reads, "and some of Asia".

Which were his friends; they had a good opinion of the apostle, and a
good liking of his doctrines, and wished well to his person, and were
concerned for his safety; though they might not have been really
converted, and truly disciples, as those in the preceding verse; for
otherwise one would think they would have relinquished their office and
place. These

sent unto him, messengers or letters,

desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre; they
observed to him the danger he would expose himself to, and entreated he
would show a greater regard to his life than to risk it in such a
manner, a life might be so useful to many; and though they were the
governors at the theatre, yet such was the rage and fury of the mob,
that it was not in their power to restrain them from doing mischief,
till such time as they were appeased.

Some therefore cried one thing, and some another,.... Not in the church
at Ephesus among the disciples, and friends of the apostle, as if they
were divided in their sentiments about his going into the theatre, some
being for it, and others against it; but the people that were gathered
together in the theatre, these were not agreed about the reason of this
tumult, some said it was on account of one thing, and some another:

for the assembly was confused; the multitude of people that were
gathered together were made up of different persons, of different
employments and sentiments, and were in no manner of form or order:

and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together; there was
a noise and a hubbub in the city; but what was the reason and meaning of
it, they were ignorant of; they were got together into the theatre in
great numbers, but what was to be done there they knew not. And this is
too often the case in religious assemblies, that the majority, at least
many, can give no account of the reason, end, and design of their
assembling together.

[Acts 19:33](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 19:33</span></span>

And they drew Alexander out of the multitude,.... Or "some of the
multitude brought forth Alexander"; into the theatre, in order to kill
him, by casting him to the wild beasts. Some think this is the same with
Alexander the coppersmith, who apostatized upon this danger he was
exposed to, and became a blasphemer, and a great enemy of the apostle,
and did him much evil, [Ti1 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#020.md). This
man, though his name was a Greek name, yet was a Jew, as is expressed in
[Act 19:34](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#034.md) and from the times of
Alexander the great, who was at Jerusalem, this name became common among
the Jews; See Gill on [Act 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#006.md).

The Jews putting him forward; being equally enemies to him, as being
under a profession of Christianity, as the Heathens were; or as the
Syriac version reads, "the people of the Jews", that were there, out of
themselves, pitched upon him as a proper person to still the uproar; and
they brought him out of the multitude, to a convenient place, where he
might be heard; and they the rather were forward to this, that he might
lay all the blame of this confusion and uproar upon Paul and his
companions, whom the Jews had an aversion to, as well as the Gentiles:

and Alexander beckoned with the hand; for silence, that he might be
heard:

and would have made his defence unto the people; which looks as if he
was a Christian, or at least was charged with being one, and was in
danger of his life on that account; and therefore was desirous of being
heard, that he might make an apology for the Christians, or remove such
an imputation from himself, if he was not.

[Acts 19:34](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">act 19:34</span></span>

But when they knew that he was a Jew,.... And so equally an enemy to
their idolatry, as Paul and his companions were, whether he was a
Christian or not.

All with one voice about the space of two hours cried out; all that were
in the theatre lift up their voices at once to prevent Alexander's
apology, or at least its being heard; and which they continued about two
hours, which was a long time to keep hallooing out,

great is Diana of the Ephesians; See Gill on [Act
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#028.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 19:35</span></span>

And when the town clerk had appeased the people,.... Caused them to
cease their loud outcry, so as that he could be heard. This person seems
to have been more than a "town clerk", as we render it; or a common
"scribe", as the Vulgate Latin, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions render it;
rather as the Syriac version, "a chief man of the city"; the Septuagint
interpreters in [Exo 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#006.md) use the word
for the Egyptian officers that were over the Israelites; and the
Babylonians used to call the priest of (a) Isis by this name; and
according to some learned men, this man's office was to register the
conquerors' names, and their rewards in the theatre; and who was chosen
into this office by the people, and was a man of some considerable
authority, as it is very apparent by what follows that this man was:

he said, ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that
the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana?
the word "Neocorus", translated "worshipper", signifies an officer in
the temple, one that looked after it, beautified and adorned it; for
"Neocorus" is from which signifies to beautify (b); though some
etymologists would have the word to signify to sweep and clean, as if
this officer was a sexton; rather, he answered to a churchwarden, and to
this agrees the Syriac version; though this office belonged not to a
single person, but to a city. Now to be a worshipper of Diana, was not
peculiar to the city of Ephesus, as appears from [Act
19:27](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#027.md) but to be Neocorus, a sacrist to
the goddess, was a favour granted to some cities, and accounted a great
honour; some had it twice, some thrice, some four times:

and of the image which fell down from Jupiter; or "of Diopetes"; so the
Palladium, or image of Pallas, was called, because it was supposed to
fall down from heaven, which Diomedes and Ulysses are said to take away
from Troy; and here it seems to be something distinct from the goddess
Diana, and her image, and may design another deity worshipped along with
her, and by them, since they make mention of more gods, [Act
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#026.md). The Vulgate Latin version takes
it to be the same with Diana, reading the words in connection with the
preceding, "and the offspring of Jupiter"; she being said to be his
daughter by Latona, as before observed; and the Ethiopic version
understands it of her image, rendering them thus, "and of that molten
image which was sent from Jupiter the great god"; and more expressly the
Syriac version, which reads, "and of her image which fell from heaven";
and so was not made with the hands of men, and could not be objected to
on that account, or denied to be a deity; and this the people might be
the rather induced to believe, since it had been in the temple before
the memory of any man. The Arabic version, reading these words in
connection with the beginning of the next verse, gives a very different
sense, "but neither indeed they that fell from heaven contradict the
faith of this thing"; as if it was to be understood of the fallen
angels, of which it can hardly be thought Demetrius had any knowledge.
This image, Pliny says (c), it was doubted of what it was made; some
said of the vine tree, others of ebony; but Athenagoras says, the old
image of Diana of the Ephesians was made of olive (d).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">act 19:36</span></span>

Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against,.... This officer
intimates, in order to quiet the mob, and make them easy, that these
things were so certain, and well known, that nobody would pretend to
contradict them, and therefore they must be mistaken in the men, whom
they had hurried into the theatre; it was impossible that they, or any
men, should be capable of saying any thing against the truth of these
things: therefore

ye ought to be quiet and do nothing rashly; to these men, to their hurt,
but sit down, and compose yourselves, and think again, and consider of
this matter, and not go into any hasty measures, which may, in the
issue, be prejudicial to yourselves.

[Acts 19:37](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">act 19:37</span></span>

For ye have brought hither these men,.... The Arabic version reads,
"these two men"; that is, Gaius and Aristarchus, whom they had brought
by force into the theatre to fight with wild beasts:

which are neither robbers of churches; or "temples"; or, as the Arabic
version renders it, "robbers of the vessels of the temple", sacrilegious
persons; they have not stolen anything out of the temple of Diana, nor
any other:

nor yet blasphemers of your goddess; they have not made mention of her
name, much less said anything against her, at least this officer did not
know that they had; and if he had, he did not stick to tell an officious
lie to screen them, as did the Egyptian midwives in favour of the Hebrew
women.

[Acts 19:38](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">act 19:38</span></span>

Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him,.... Who
were the ringleaders and encouragers of this tumult:

have a matter against any man; any accusation, or charge, any crime to
accuse him of, and charge him with:

the law is open; or court days are kept; there are certain times fixed
for the hearing and trying of causes, where and when such an affair
should be regularly brought; and not use such disorderly methods, and
throw a city into confusion, and break the peace as these men had done:
the Syriac version renders it, "they are artificers"; that is, Demetrius
and the craftsmen with him; they are tradesmen, and it does not belong
to them, nor should they take upon themselves to judge and determine
what is right or wrong:

and there are deputies; or "proconsuls"; the proconsul and his deputy,
to whom such matters appertain, and who are judges in such cases, and to
whom application should be made, and before whom such cases should be
brought, and heard, and tried: the Syriac version reads in the singular
number, "and there is a proconsul in the city"; a Roman governor and
judge, whose province it is to determine such matters:

let them implead one another; let the plaintiff bring his accusation,
and charge, and let the others defend themselves, and let things proceed
in a due course of law, and so issue.

[Acts 19:39](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">act 19:39</span></span>

But if ye inquire anything concerning other matters,.... Than what
belongs to the craft and business of Demetrius, and the artificers:

it shall be determined in a lawful assembly; that is, called together
according to law, and who have a right to hear, try, and judge causes,
which such a confused lawless assembly as this in the theatre had not.

[Acts 19:40](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">act 19:40</span></span>

For we are in danger of being called in question,.... Or are liable to
be called to an account, reproved, and punished by the Roman proconsul,
appointed over this city, or by the Roman emperor, or the Roman senate:
for this day's uproar; it being capable of being interpreted as a riot,
tumult, and sedition:

there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse:
or no reason can be assigned, why such a number of people should gather
together; none can be given that will justify it, or that can be alleged
in favour of it.

[Acts 19:41](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">act 19:41</span></span>

And when he had thus spoken,.... Or delivered this oration, made use of
the above arguments, reasonings, and expostulations:

he dismissed the assembly; he ordered them to break up, and every one to
return home in peace, and go about his own business; and thus Paul, and
his companions, were delivered from an imminent danger they were exposed
to.
