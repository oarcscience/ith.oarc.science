### [Joshua Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#001.md)

[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md)

INTRODUCTION TO JOSHUA 6

In this chapter Joshua is assured, though Jericho was closely shut up,
it should be delivered into his hands, [Jos
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#001.md); and he is directed, with the
army, to go round the city six days together, seven priests bearing the
ark of the Lord, with seven trumpets sounding; and on the seventh day to
go round it seven times in like manner, when its wall should fall, [Jos
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#003.md); which order Joshua communicated
to the priests, and to the people, and which was put into execution by
them, with some other instructions he gave them, [Jos
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#006.md); particularly that the city, and
all in it, should be devoted to the Lord, and none spared, but Rahab and
her family, [Jos 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#017.md); the success was
according to the assurance given by the Lord, [Jos
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#020.md); when all in the city were
destroyed, and that was burnt with fire, and the gold, silver, brass,
and iron, brought into the house of the Lord, and Rahab and her father's
household were saved alive, [Jos 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#021.md);
and the chapter is closed with an adjuration of Joshua, cursing the man
that should rebuild the city; and with this observation, that the fame
of Joshua upon this was spread abroad throughout the country, [Jos
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#026.md).

[Joshua 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 6:1</span></span>

Now Jericho was straitly shut up, because of the children of Israel,....
Or "it shut up", or "was shutting, and was shut up" (u); that is, the
king and the inhabitants shut it up within; the Targum says with iron
doors, and bars of brass, and it was blocked up without by the children
of Israel:

none went out and none came in; none of their forces went out to make a
sally on the Israelites, or to seek to make peace with them; nor any of
their neighbours went in to them, to carry them any provision, or to
assist them, or to be sheltered by them, not being able to do it because
of the camp of Israel.

[Joshua 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 6:2</span></span>

And the Lord said unto Joshua,.... The same divine Person called in the
preceding chapter the Captain of the Lord's host, [Jos
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#014.md), now with him, and who gave him
the following orders, instructions, and assurances:

see, I have given into thy hand Jericho, and the king thereof: which
might be concluded from the fear that was fallen upon the inhabitants of
the city and their king, and from their shutting themselves up so
closely, not daring to come out against Israel: and especially from this
declaration and promise of the Lord; and which should be done in such a
manner, as that it would clearly appear to be of the Lord, and not men:

and the mighty men of valour; the military men, the soldiers, or army
that were under the command of the king of Jericho; or, as Kimchi reads
it, "though" mighty men, yet they should not be able to defend the city,
or hinder its falling into their hands; for what were they to the mighty
God of Israel?

[Joshua 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 6:3</span></span>

And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war,.... Joshua their chief
commander under the Lord, and all that were able to make war, even all
above twenty years of age; these were to compass the city, not in the
form of a siege, but by a procession around it:

and go round about the city once; or one time, for the first once in a
day, and no more:

thus shall thou do six days; one after another; that is, go round it,
once every day, for such a time. This order was given, according to the
Jews (w), the twenty second of Nisan, after the feast of unleavened
bread was over.

[Joshua 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 6:4</span></span>

And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams'
horns,.... The ark was to be taken up and carried by priests round the
city. Ben Gersom observes, that this was to direct the Israelites to
keep and do according to all that was written in it; that is, in the
law, which was contained in it; but no doubt the design of it was to
show, that the subduing of Jericho, and the miracle that would be
wrought, were owing to the power and presence of God, of which the ark
was a symbol: and before it were to go seven other priests, with
trumpets in their hands; which, according to our version, were made of
rams horns: in the original it is "jobelim", or "jubilee" trumpets. Some
think it means only such as they were to use in the year of jubilee; so
Abarbinel and others, as Masius and Noldius (x); that they had their
name from Jubal, the first inventor of musical instruments, [Gen
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#021.md); for rams' horns are objected to
because they are solid, and not hollow; as if they could not be bored
and made hollow, and fit for such a purpose. The Targum, Jarchi, and
Kimchi, interpret the word by rams horns, as we do (y); and observe what
R. Akiba said,"when (says he) I went into Arabia, I heard them call; a
ram "jobel"; and the trumpet itself is called "jobel", because made of a
ram's horn (z):"

and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times; in the same
manner as on the other days:

and the priests shall blow with the trumpets; which they were to do; and
did every day.

[Joshua 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 6:5</span></span>

And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the
ram's horn,.... Continue blowing, and protracting, and drawing out the
sound a long time; which they did only on the seventh day; on the other
days it was but a short blast they made at a time; so that this being
different, it would be a good sign and token to the people to do what
they are next directed to:

and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet; drawn out to a great length:

all the people shall shout with a great shout; at once, as when an onset
is made in battle, or a victory is obtained:

and the wall of the city shall fall down flat; or "under itself" (a);
which Jarchi interprets, in its place; that is, where it stood, and be
swallowed up in it: so the Targum,"and it shall be swallowed up under
it;''yet so that somewhat of it should be seen, as an attestation and
proof of the miracle, as Kimchi; who says,"it means that it should be
swallowed up in its place under the earth, and a little of it appear
above ground for a memorial of the miracle:"

and the people shall ascend up, every man straight before him; just as
they were in the order of procession; for the wall being fallen
everywhere, they would have no occasion to make up to one certain place,
as when a breach is only made in one place, and the besiegers are
obliged to go so many a breast to enter at it; but in this case they
might go straight up from whence they were, and enter the city without
any obstruction and difficulty.

[Joshua 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 6:6</span></span>

And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests,.... Not the Levites and
Kohathites, whose business it was in common to bear the ark, but upon
this occasion the priests; not all of them, but as many as were
sufficient for the purpose:

and said unto them, take up the ark of the covenant; by putting the
staves into the rings of it, and so carry it, [Exo
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#014.md); see [Num
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#009.md),

and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark
of the Lord: See Gill on [Jos 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#004.md).

[Joshua 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 6:7</span></span>

And he said unto the people, pass on, and compass the city,.... The
women and children, the young men under twenty years of age, the unarmed
part of the camp, as distinguished from the armed men:

and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the Lord; to guard
the ark, protect the priests, and defend the people, should any sally be
made by the enemy upon them. These seem to design all the males that
were above twenty years of age able to bear arms, and fit for war;
though some restrain it to the forty thousand of the tribes of Reuben,
Gad, and Manasseh, [Jos 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#014.md).

[Joshua 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jos 6:8</span></span>

And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken to the people,.... Both
armed and unarmed; had finished the orders and directions he gave them
before mentioned:

that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed
on before the Lord; in his sight, and by his direction, and at his
command given by Joshua, and before the ark, the symbol of his presence:

and blew with the trumpets; a short blast as they went along; this they
did on each of the six days:

and the ark of the covenant of the Lord followed them; being borne by
priests, [Jos 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#006.md).

[Joshua 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 6:9</span></span>

And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the
trumpets,.... Whom Jarchi, Kimchi, and Abarbinel, interpret of Reuben
and Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh; that is, as many of them as
Joshua took with him over Jordan; though rather all the armed men in the
camp are meant; at least along with those mentioned went the standards
of Judah and Ephraim:

and the rereward came after the ark; because the tribe of Dan was the
rereward in journeying, [Num 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#031.md);
hence the Targum paraphrases the words,"and the tribe of the house of
Dan went after the ark;''and so both Jarchi and Kimchi interpret it: but
rather the body of the people unarmed are designed; at least these were
brought up by the standard of Dan; or otherwise no place in this
procession is appointed for them, whose business it was to make the
great shout on the seventh day with the rest:

the priests going on and blowing with the trumpets; the word "priests"
is not in the text, but is rightly supplied; for, as Kimchi and
Abarbinel observe, this is not said of the rereward, but of the priests,
for they only bore and blew the trumpets; and so the Targum reads,"the
priests going on, &c.''

[Joshua 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 6:10</span></span>

And Joshua had commanded the people,.... When he gave them their orders
to pass on, and compass the city, [Jos
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#007.md),

saying, ye shall not shout; that is, on any of the six days as they went
round the city, only on the seventh; for this being a sign of victory,
it was not to be made until the day when it should be obtained;
otherwise, had they shouted, and nothing followed on it, it would have
exposed them to the contempt of the inhabitants of Jericho, and would
have put them in spirit, and hardened them:

nor make any noise with your voice; as laughing, singing, &c. This
profound silence was to be observed, to add to the gravity and solemnity
of the procession; and on account of the surprising miracle that was to
be wrought, and particularly because of the ark, the symbol of the
divine Presence, borne before them; and when God in his providence was
about to speak in so awful a manner, and to do such a surprising work,
it was very fit and decent that they should be silent before him; see
[Hab 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#020.md),

neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth; no conversation or
discourse were to be had with each other as they passed along; for this
is only to be restrained to the procession; when they returned, and in
their camp, they might talk and discourse as at other times:

until the day I bid you shout, then shall ye shout; for as yet it seems
Joshua had not told them how many days they should surround the city in
this manner, and on what day the shout should be made by them.

[Joshua 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jos 6:11</span></span>

So the ark of the Lord compassed the city,.... Being bore by the
priests, who carried it round the city; it may as well be rendered and
interpreted as it is by Kimchi,"he, i.e. Joshua, caused the ark of the
Lord to compass the city;''

that is, he gave orders to the priests to take it up, and go round with
it on the first day:

going about it once; on that day, and no more; keeping at such a
distance, as to be out of the reach of stones or arrows cast from the
walls of the city:

and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp; the night
following; not only the priests that bare the ark, but those that blew
with the trumpets, and all the armed men, and the people.

[Joshua 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jos 6:12</span></span>

And Joshua rose early in the morning,.... Of the second day; to take
care of, direct, and prepare everything for another procession on that
day; so active and diligent was he to do the will and work of God,
exactly and punctually:

and the priests took up the ark of the Lord; and carried it about as
they had done the day before.

[Joshua 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jos 6:13</span></span>

And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark
of the Lord,.... See Gill on [Jos 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#004.md),

went on continually; or, "going they went" (b): kept on going, making no
stop at all, until they had compassed the city:

and blew with the trumpets; as they went along:

and the armed men went before them, but the rereward came after the ark
of the Lord; which the Targum paraphrases as on [Jos
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#009.md),

the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets; See Gill on [Jos
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#009.md).

[Joshua 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 6:14</span></span>

And the second day they compassed the city once,.... Went round it one
time only; as on the first:

and returned into the camp: which was at Gilgal, [Jos
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#010.md),

so they did six days: four more after these two successively, and
proceeded in the same order and manner as on those two days.

[Joshua 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jos 6:15</span></span>

And it came to pass on the seventh day,.... Which Jarchi says was the
Sabbath day, and which is a common notion of the Jews (c); but whether
it was or not, it is certain that one of these seven days must be a
sabbath, in which the several things ordered were done, and the
procession made. Kimchi observes, that their Rabbins say this was the
sabbath day; and he adds, what is pretty remarkable,"though they slew
and burnt on the sabbath day, he that commanded the sabbath commanded to
profane the sabbath in the subduing of Jericho;''with which compare what
our Lord says, [Mat 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#003.md),

that they rose early, about the dawning of the day; having seven times
the work to do they did on the other six days:

and compassed the city after the same manner seven times; after the same
manner as they had done the six preceding days:

only on that day they compassed the city seven times; whereas on the
other days they only went round it once, which distinguished this day
from the rest.

\(c\) Seder Olam Rabba, c. 11. p. 31. Bemidbar Rabba, sect. 14. fol.

[Joshua 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jos 6:16</span></span>

And it came to pass at the seventh time,.... Of their going round the
city on the seventh day: and at the seventh time:

when the priests blew with the trumpets; as they did every time they
compassed the city:

Joshua said unto the people, shout; both those that were armed, and
those that were not; they were to make one grand and general shout at
once, as when victory is obtained, or is sure, and so it follows:

for the Lord hath given you the city; intimating that it would be
presently delivered into their hands, and in such manner, that it would
plainly show it was of the Lord, and no other.

[Joshua 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jos 6:17</span></span>

And the city shall be accursed,.... Or, be a "cherem", devoted to the
Lord, as it follows:

even it and all that are therein, to the Lord; the city and the
inhabitants of it should be devoted to destruction, and the riches and
spoil of it dedicated to sacred uses, and not become the property of the
Israelites; for as this was the first city in the had of Canaan that was
conquered, it was fit the firstfruits of the conquest should be the
Lord's, as an acknowledgment of his gift of the land unto them, and that
the conquest of it was owing to him; though it might be some
mortification to the Israelites, and a trial of their faith and
obedience, that the first and so fine a city should not become their
habitation, but be utterly destroyed, and not to be built more; and all
the riches of it either consumed, or converted to other uses, and not
their own. This Joshua thought fit to declare to the Israelites, before
the taking of the city, that they might know what they had to do. The
Jewish doctors generally suppose that Joshua ordered this of himself, of
his own accord and will; but Kimchi is of opinion that the Lord gave him
this order, which is most probable, yea, certain from [Jos
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#011.md),

only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the
house; she and her father's family, as she requested, and the spies
promised; here the Targum calls her, as elsewhere, Rahab the innkeeper
or victualler; and so in [Jos 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#022.md),

because she hid the messengers that we sent; and so preserved them from
being taken by the messengers of the king of Jericho, who were sent in
pursuit of them. These though sent only by Joshua, without the knowledge
of the people, yet it being on their account, and their good, and by him
as their head and governor, is ascribed to them also. This fact of
Rahab's is observed by him as a reason for sparing her, and those that
were with her, when all the rest would be put to the sword; and is
mentioned as an instance of her faith, and of the evidence of it, [Heb
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#031.md).

[Joshua 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jos 6:18</span></span>

And you in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing,.... From
laying hold on, secreting, and enjoying as their own, what was devoted
to another use:

lest ye make yourselves accursed; or a "cherem", also devoted to
destruction:

when ye take of the accursed thing; any part of it, be it what it will,
gold or any other metal, or raiment, and the like:

and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it; for being done
secretly, and not known who did it, the whole body of the people would
be chargeable with it, and suffer on account of it, unless discovered
and punished, and as more fully appears by an after instance.

[Joshua 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jos 6:19</span></span>

But all the silver and gold, and vessels of brass and iron,

are consecrated to the Lord,.... Or rather, "for all the silver", &c. as
the particle here used sometimes signifies, and is so rendered (d): each
of these metals, and whatsoever were made of them, were set apart for
the Lord, and dedicated to sacred uses, and might not be converted to
any other, unless what were upon their idols, which were to be burnt
with fire, [Deu 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#025.md),

they shall come into the treasury of the Lord; be brought into the
tabernacle, as Kimchi and Abarbinel interpret it, into some apartment
there destined for such service, and which is clear from [Jos
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#024.md); the same where the offering of
the officers was brought after the battle with Midian, [Num
31:54](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#054.md).

[Joshua 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jos 6:20</span></span>

So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets,.... As
Joshua had charged them, [Jos 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#016.md),

and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet,

and the people shouted with a great shout; that is, gave a loud shout,
on hearing the long blast of the trumpets blown by the priests the
seventh time, as they were no doubt directed by Joshua, agreeably to the
order given to him; see [Jos 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#005.md),

that the wall fell down flat; the wall of the city of Jericho, as the
Lord said it should; see Gill on [Jos
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#005.md),

so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him,
and they took the city; they went up to it from the plain, where they
were, and entered it without any difficulty, the wall being fallen, and
that everywhere: so that they went directly from the place where they
were, and went in right over against them, into every quarter and, part
of the city, and seized on it, and possessed it at once. Various things
may be observed concerning this surprising event; as that it was
supernatural, and cannot be ascribed to second causes, there being
nothing in the procession round the city, the blowing of the trumpets,
or shout of the people, that could occasion the wall to fall; and that
no defences or fortifications are anything against God, when it is his
will a city should be taken, with whom nothing is impossible; and that
sometimes unlikely means are appointed and used by him for doing great
things, that the power may appear to be his by which they are done; and
that faith stops at nothing, when it has the word and promise of God to
encourage and support it; and that God does everything in his own time
and way. The falling of the walls of Jericho may be considered as an
emblem of the fall of Babylon; these two cities agree, as in their
greatness, so in their wickedness, [Rev
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#004.md); and as Jericho stood in the way
of Israel's inheriting the land, being a frontier and barrier town; so
mystical Babylon stands in the way of the kingdom of Christ, and its
spread in the world, and particularly of the conversion of the Jews,
[Rev 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#014.md). The fall of Jericho was
very sudden, and when not expected by the inhabitants of it; and so will
be the fall of Babylon, [Rev 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#007.md); and
as Jericho fell at the sound of rams horns, the destruction of
antichrist, or mystical Babylon, will be through the preaching of the
Gospel, [Rev 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#006.md); and as the one was
by the sounding of seven priests, at the seventh time of sounding, on
the seventh day; so the ruin of antichrist will be at the seventh
angel's sounding the seventh trumpet, and pouring out the seventh vial,
[Rev 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#007.md); and as at the destruction
of the one, so of the other, but few saved from the common calamity,
[Rev 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#004.md); and both never to be raised
up and built again, [Rev 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#021.md); And it
may be considered also as an emblem of the subjection of the Gentile
world to Christ; which, like Jericho, or the moon, as some observe the
name signifies, is very changeable; and as that city, and the
inhabitants of it, an enemy to God, and his people, and yet made subject
by the ministry of his word; as particularly it will be when the
kingdoms of this world shall become his: or rather it may be an emblem
of the subjection of particular souls to Christ, and the means thereof;
who are like the walled city of Jericho in their unregenerate state,
their hearts hard, stubborn, and inflexible, and enmity to God; are
self-confident, vainly puffed up in their fleshly minds, and shut up in
unbelief, and kept and guarded by Satan, the strong man armed; but all
these strong holds of sin and Satan are brought down and demolished in
conversion; and that by means of the sound of the Gospel, which is as
despicable with men as the sound of the rams' horns were to the
inhabitants of Jericho; but is a jubilee and joyful sound, a sound of
love, grace, mercy, and salvation; and being accompanied with the Spirit
and grace of God, is the power of God unto salvation; and mighty through
him for the removing the hardness of men's hearts, and bringing them
into subjection and obedience to Christ.

[Joshua 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#021.md)

And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city,.... All the
inhabitants of it, by the direction of Joshua, and according to the
order of the Lord, [Deu 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001.md); being
guilty of capital crimes, which deserved death, as idolatry, incest, &c.

both men and women, young and old; neither sex nor age were spared:

and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword; in which
creatures chiefly lay the substance of the eastern people; see [Job
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#003.md).

But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country,....
Whom he had sent on that errand, [Jos
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#001.md); and what follows he had said unto
them before the people entered into the city, and perhaps before the
walls of it fell; and indeed from [Jos
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#016.md), it appears to have been said at
the time he gave the people orders to shout:

go into the harlot's house: he does not mention her name but they full
well knew who he meant:

and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath; not so much her
substance, as her father's household, she had got together there, that
they might be saved, as had been promised her:

as ye sware unto her; so that this order was partly on account of her
kindness to them, [Jos 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#017.md); and
partly on account of the oath which they had taken, and which Joshua
would have inviolably kept.

And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab,....
Not only went into the city, but into Rahab's house, which they knew
again by the scarlet thread hung out at the window of it. But here a
difficulty occurs, how they could be said to go into her house, when it
was built on the town wall, [Jos 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#015.md);
and that was now fallen down flat. Abarbinel thinks that when the spies
went round the city, they saw the scarlet thread in the window of her
house, and set their eyes on the house, or wistly observed it; and
marked it in such manner, that after the fall of the wall they went to
the place of her house, and brought her out, though her house was broken
down, and no wall standing: but then they could not be said properly to
go into her house, and bring her out. Kimchi is of opinion that not all
the wall of the city fell, but what was over against the camp of Israel;
and that the house of Rahab was on the wall on the other side: but it
seems by the account of it as if the whole wall fell; and the apostle
says, "the walls of Jericho fell down", [Heb
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#030.md); all of them; and so the
Septuagint version of [Jos 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#020.md)."and
the whole wall, or all the wall fell round about:''and I see not why it
may not be thought that the whole wall fell, excepting that small part
alone which Rahab's house stood; and that standing alone would make the
miracle the greater, and show the divine approbation of saving Rahab and
her family: besides, if the wall sunk down in its place all around into
the earth, as the Jews understand the phrase; See Gill on [Jos
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#005.md); the house might continue on it
firm and unmoved, going down with it to the surface of the earth, where
it may be supposed the top of the wall was; and so they might go in and
take her out, and preserve her from being destroyed with the rest of the
inhabitants; and not only her:

but her father and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had;
all other relations that were with her, particularly her sisters, which
are in her request, [Jos 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#013.md); with
all that appertained to her brethren and sisters, which is there
expressed also:

and they brought out all her kindred; before mentioned, or if there were
any other of her relations she had taken into her house for safety; or
"all her families" (e), for her father's household might be branched out
into various families, and become numerous, and so be an emblem of the
number of Gentile sinners saved by Christ the antitype of Joshua:

and left them without the camp of Israel; until they, became proselytes,
and embraced the religion of Israel, as Kimchi remarks. However, being
Gentiles, some external rites and ceremonies were to be performed upon
them, as well as a declaration at least of their renouncing idolatry was
required of them, before they could be admitted into the camp of Israel;
and which was required even of a proselyte of the gate, or of one that
was only a sojourner among them.

And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein,.... As
Babylon the great, of which this city was an emblem, as has been
observed; see Gill on [Jos 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#020.md); will
be burnt with fire also, [Rev 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#008.md),

only the silver and the gold, and the vessels of brass and iron, they
put into the treasury of the house of the Lord; See Gill on [Jos
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#019.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jos 6:25</span></span>

And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive,.... From perishing by the
sword, as the rest of the inhabitants did. Kimchi says, some interpret
it of his giving her food, and an inheritance by which she might live;
and Josephus (f) intimates the same: he says, he gave her fields, and
had her in great honour and esteem; and it is the notion of some Jewish
writers, that he took her to wife, and that this is meant by saving her
alive; which sense Kimchi disapproves of, as being foreign; besides, it
was not Joshua, but Salmon, a prince in Israel, that married her, [Mat
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#005.md),

and her father's household, and all she had; that is, he saved alive all
her relations, and it may be her cattle, if she had any; and those of
her kindred also, as their sheep, oxen, and asses, when those of others
were killed, [Jos 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#021.md). Some also
understand this of intermarriages of principal persons in Israel with
some of her father's fairly; but it only signifies that their lives were
spared, when the whole city was destroyed with the edge of the sword:

and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day; which may be meant either
personally of Rahab, who was living and dwelt in the land of Canaan,
when this history was written; and serves to strengthen the opinion that
Joshua was the writer of it, and to explain the meaning of the phrase
"unto this day", elsewhere used in this book; and to remove any
objection from it against his being the author of it; or else of her
dwelling there in her posterity, and so she might dwell in it unto the
times of the Messiah, who sprang from her, [Mat
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#005.md),

because she hid the messengers which Joshua, sent to spy out Jericho;
this was the reason of her and her father's family being saved alive;
See Gill on [Jos 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#017.md).

And Joshua adjured them at that time,.... When the city was burnt and
spoiled; not that he adjured the people individually, or one by one,
which was not very practicable, but in a general way:

saying, cursed be the man before the Lord; let him be cursed by him with
the curses written in the book of the law; and let him be driven from
him, from his presence, as Cain was:

that riseth up, and buildeth this city Jericho; that rises up in future
time, and rebuilds it; for it cannot be thought that after such an
adjuration anyone would start up quickly, and rebuild it:

he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his
youngest son shall he set up the gates of it; that is, while he is
laying, or as soon as he has laid the foundation of the city, his eldest
son should die; and as he went on with the building, other sons of his,
if he had more than two, should be taken away by death likewise; and by
the time he has finished it, signified by setting up the gates of it,
both for ornament and security, his youngest and last son should die
also; so that his whole posterity should be taken alway, as a curse of
God upon him for rebuilding the city; which was fulfilled in Hiel the
Bethelite, the rebuilder of this city in the times of Ahab, five or six
hundred years after this adjuration was made, when either it was
forgotten, or, however, little regarded: Maimonides observes (g), that
this was made that the miracle might remain in perpetual memory, for
whoever should see the wall sunk in the earth, it would be plain and
clear to him that this was not the form of a building demolished, but
that it fell by a miracle; and yet this city became a very flourishing
one in later times; we soon hear of the school of the prophets in it,
[Kg2 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#005); here, Strabo (h.md) says, was a
royal palace, where, as Josephus (i) relates, Herod died, and who speaks
of an amphitheatre and hippodrome in it; in this city sometimes the
sanhedrim sat, and a great number of the stationary priests dwelt, even
half a station, twelve thousand of them, all which is observed by Dr.
Lightfoot (k); our Lord himself honoured it with his presence, [Luk
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#001.md).

So the Lord was with Joshua,.... Counselling and directing him what to
do, prospering and succeeding him in all that he engaged; the Targum
is,"the Word of the Lord was for the help of Joshua;''the essential
Word, Christ the Son of God, called the Captain of the Lord's host, [Jos
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#014.md); and who, continued with him
speaking to him and giving him orders, [Jos
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#002.md),

and his fame was noised throughout all the country; for his wisdom and
courage, for the wonderful things done for him and by him, and the great
success that attended him, through the power and presence of God with
him; which struck terror into the inhabitants of the land, and made his
conquest of it the more easy.
