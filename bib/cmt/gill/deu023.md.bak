### [Deuteronomy Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 23:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO DEUTERONOMY 23

Orders are here given to restrain certain persons from entering into the
congregation of the Lord, [Deu 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#001.md),
and to take care that there be no unclean person in the camp, or any
indecent thing done in it, [Deu 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#009.md),
to protect fugitive servants, and not deliver them up to their masters,
[Deu 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#015.md) not to suffer a filthy
person to be among them, or any filthy thing to be brought into the
house of God for a vow, [Deu 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#017.md),
then follow some laws against usury, and for the payment of vows, [Deu
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#019.md), and the chapter is concluded
with some directions how to behave in a neighbour's vineyard, or
standing corn, [Deu 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#024.md).

[Deuteronomy 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 23:1</span></span>

He that is wounded in the stones,.... In any of them, not accidentally,
but purposely; which are crushed and bruised by the hands of men, with a
design to make him unfit for generation, or to make an eunuch of him:

or that hath his privy member cut by himself or another, and is a
thorough eunuch by the hands of men; for of such eunuchs that are made
by men, and not born so, the law speaks; so Maimonides interprets it
(f); See Gill on [Mat 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#012.md).

shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord; which is to be
understood not of the sanctuary of the Lord, or of being refused
admittance into the church of God, and to join in religious rites, and
partake of sacred ordinances, which all Israelites, and strangers that
were proselytes, had a right unto; such might bring their offerings,
keep the passover, &c. [Exo 12:48](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#048.md) nor
of the commonwealth of Israel, as if unfit to be members of civil
society; it cannot be thought that such defects should abridge them of
their civil rights and privileges: but by the congregation is to be
understood the elders, judges, and representatives of the people, that
met together in some one place to execute judgment; see [Num
35:12](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#012.md), into which such persons were
not to be admitted; either because disgraceful and dishonourable, or
because of the influence such defects have on their minds, they thereby
becoming effeminate, irresolute, and wanting courage, as well as in
opposition to the customs and usages of the Heathens, with whom it was
common to admit such persons to civil offices; hence the word eunuch is
sometimes used for an officer, [Gen
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#036) and elsewhere; the Jews (g.md)
restrain this law to marriage, but unnecessarily.

[Deuteronomy 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 23:2</span></span>

A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord,.... That is
born of whoredom, as the Targum of Jonathan; and for the sake of
avoiding whoredom and deterring from it was this law made, according to
Maimonides (h), that adulterers might see, as he observes, that they
affect their whole family with an irreparable stain, should they commit
such an infamous action; though the Jews commonly interpret it of one
that is born of any of those incestuous copulations forbidden in [Lev
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#001.md) which they gather from this
following upon, and being near unto one of those incests mentioned in
the last verse of the preceding chapter (i); and it is a rule with them
(k), that persons born of such copulations were reckoned bastards; now
such an one, according to Jarchi, might not marry an Israelitish woman,
or rather might not be admitted into the assembly of elders, or bear any
public office. Jephthah may seem to be an objection to this, who was the
son of an harlot, [Jdg 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#001.md) which
might be owing to the badness of the times, the laws of God being
neglected, or to the providence of God so ordering it, who is not bound
by his own laws, though men are; nor was he the son of a common harlot,
nor of an incestuous person, but of his father's concubine; besides some
think such only are intended who were born of strangers and not
Israelites:

even unto his tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation
of the Lord; which seems as if he might at the eleventh; but it is
generally interpreted never, as is gathered from the following verse,
and from the tenth number being an absolute and perfect one; yet
according to the Jewish writers there were ways and means by which their
posterity became legitimate; so they say, bastards may be purified (or
legitimated), how? if one marries a servant maid, the child is a
servant, who if he becomes free, (his) son is a free man (l).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 23:3</span></span>

An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the
Lord,.... Or marry an Israelitish woman, as Jarchi, and so the Targum of
Jonathan,"the male Ammonites and Moabites are not fit to take a wife of
the congregation of the Lord;''for the Jews restrain this to men,
because it is, as Aben Ezra observes, an Ammonite, not an Ammonitess, a
Moabite, not a Moabitess; they allow that females of those nations might
be married to Israelites, that is, provided they were proselytesses, as
Ruth was (m):

even to their tenth generation, shall they not enter into the
congregation of the Lord for ever; that is, not only to the tenth
generation, but for ever; and this law was understood as in force in
Nehemiah's time, which was more than ten generations from the making of
it; though now, as these nations are no more a distinct people, they
suppose it is no longer binding (n).

[Deuteronomy 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 23:4</span></span>

Because they met you not with bread and with water,.... To supply them
therewith, either as a gift, which was a piece of humanity to strangers
and travellers, or rather to sell unto them, for on no other terms did
the Israelites desire their bread and their water:

in the way when ye came forth out of Egypt; not as soon as they came
forth from thence, for it was near forty years after; but it was while
they were in the way from thence, as they were journeying to the land of
Canaan, and so were travellers, and should have had kindness shown them
as such; for though they needed not bread and water, God providing both
for them, yet this does not excuse the inhumanity of these people: the
words are to be understood by way of distribution; this charge here only
belongs to the Ammonites, for it appears that the Moabites did give them
bread and water for money, [Deu 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#028.md)
as what follows belongs peculiarly to the Moabites and not the
Ammonites:

and because they hired against thee Balaam the son of Pethor of
Mesopotamia, to curse thee; this the Moabites did in conjunction with
the Midianites, but the Ammonites had no concern in it; see [Num
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#007.md), it was not therefore because the
Moabites and Ammonites were born in incest that they were forbidden
entrance into the congregation of the Lord; which might have been
thought to have been the reason of it, these instances following upon
the former, had not these reasons been assigned.

[Deuteronomy 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 23:5</span></span>

Nevertheless, the Lord thy God would not hearken unto Balaam,.... To his
solicitations, and the methods he took to prevail on the Lord to suffer
him to curse Israel, which he gladly would have done for the sake of
Balak's reward:

but the Lord thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee; in the
very mouth of Balaam, as the Targum of Jonathan; for when he opened his
mouth and Balak expected he would have cursed Israel, and he intended
it, could he have been permitted, the Lord overruled his tongue, and put
such words into his mouth, that instead of cursing Israel, he blessed
him; see [Num 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#011.md),

because the Lord thy God loved thee; and therefore would not suffer them
to be cursed; for whom the Lord loves they are blessed, and shall be so
in time and to eternity.

[Deuteronomy 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 23:6</span></span>

Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for
ever. Not that they were to retain malice towards them, or indulge a
spirit of revenge, or not do them any good offices in a private way,
which is contrary to the law of love; nor does this contradict any
offices of kindness and friendship that might be performed in a personal
way: so we find that David had a kindness for Hanun the Ammonite, and
showed it, though ill rewarded for it, yet is not blamed for doing it;
[Sa2 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#002.md) for these words respect not
persons in a private capacity, but the people of Israel as a body
politic, who, as such, were not to carry on trade and commerce with
those people, nor intermarry with them, nor make leagues and enter into
alliances with them; the reason of which was, because being very near
neighbours to them, had there not been such a law, as a wall of
partition between them, they might have become very familiar, and so
have learnt their evil ways and customs, which this was designed to
prevent: the Jews restrain (o) this to overtures and proclamations of
peace, which they were not to make with these nations, as they were
directed to do when they went out to war with others, [Deu
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#010.md).

[Deuteronomy 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 23:7</span></span>

Thou shall not abhor an Edomite,.... Or an Idumean, the descendants of
Esau, whose name was Edom, [Gen 25:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#030.md)
the Targum of Jonathan adds, "that comes to be made a proselyte"; he was
not to be rejected with abhorrence, because of the old grudge between
Jacob and Esau, and which was become national in their posterity:

for he is thy brother; the Israelites and the Edomites were nearest akin
to each other of all the nations; for Jacob and Esau were own brothers
by father's and mother's side, yea, were twin brothers; the relation was
very near:

thou shall not abhor an Egyptian; that comes to be made a proselyte
also, as the same Targum; though the Israelites were so ill used by
them, their lives made bitter with hard bondage, and their male infants
slain by them, and they for a long time refused their liberty to depart:

because thou wast a stranger in his land: and at first received many
favours and kindnesses from them, being supported and supplied with
provisions during a long famine; and had one of the richest and most
fruitful parts of the country assigned them to dwell in; and old favours
were not to be forgotten, though they had been followed with great
unkindness and cruelty.

[Deuteronomy 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 23:8</span></span>

The children that are begotten of them, Of such as became proselytes:

shall enter into the congregation of the Lord in their third generation;
not in the third generation from the time that this law was made, but
from the time that any of them should embrace the true religion; their
sons were the second generation, and their grandchildren the third; and
such might be admitted into the congregation, and be reckoned as of
them, both in their civil and church state, and be capable of serving
even offices among them, and of marriage with them, as the Targum of
Jonathan; which some of the Jews interpret of males only, for females,
according to them, might be married immediately as soon as made
proselytes, in which way they account for the lawfulness of Solomon's
marriage of Pharaoh's daughter (p).

[Deuteronomy 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 23:9</span></span>

When the host goeth forth against thine enemies,.... An army of soldiers
march in order to meet the enemy and fight him:

then keep thee from every wicked thing; the Targum of Jonathan adds, by
way of explanation,"from strange worship, uncovering of nakedness, and
from shedding innocent blood;''that is, from idolatry, uncleanness of
every sort, and murder; and all other wickednesses ought to be abstained
from at all times by all persons, but especially by soldiers in such a
circumstance, just going to battle; since sin committed weakens natural
courage, as it loads the conscience with guilt; and since victory and
success, which depend upon the blessing of God on arms, cannot be
reasonably expected, where vices of all sorts are indulged and abound;
and especially seeing such are about to expose their lives to the utmost
danger, and know not but that in a few hours they must exchange this
life for another, and appear before God, the Judge of all, against whom
they sin; and yet how little are these things thought of by such in
common! it was the wisdom of the Jewish legislature, which was of God,
to inculcate such things into the minds of their soldiers.

[Deuteronomy 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 23:10</span></span>

If there be among you any man that is not clean,.... Any unclean person
in the army, that was even ceremonially unclean in any of the instances
the law makes so, one of which put for the rest is mentioned:

by reason of uncleanness that chanceth him by night; through pollution
by a nocturnal flux, as the Septuagint version, or a gonorrhoea, an
involuntary one, occasioned by impure thoughts and imaginations in
dreams; the same case as in [Lev
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#016.md).

then shall he go abroad out of the camp; out of the army, lest others
should be defiled by such; they not having houses to retire to, and
chambers to keep themselves in separate from others, as when at home:

he shall not come within the camp; that is, not till he has done what is
prescribed him in the next verse. Jarchi says, he might not come into
the camp of the Levites, and much less into the camp of God.

[Deuteronomy 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 23:11</span></span>

But it shall be, when evening cometh on,.... When the day declines, and
it is near sun setting:

he shall wash himself with water; dip himself all over in water, not
only wash his garments but his flesh:

and when the sun is down he shall come into the camp again; and take his
place and rank in the army. Now if all this was necessary on account of
ceremonial uncleanness, which as much as possible was to be avoided, how
much more careful were they to be of moral uncleanness, as fornication,
adultery, and all sorts of debauchery and lewdness? and yet nothing more
frequent among those that are of the military order; it would be well if
there was no occasion for the reproach Maimonides (q) casts upon the
camps of the Heathens, among whom, no doubt, he means Christians, if not
principally; when he observes that these orders were given, that this
might be deeply fixed in the mind of every one, that their camp ought to
be holy as the sanctuary of God, and not like the camps of the Gentiles,
in which abound corruptions of all kinds, transgressions, rapines,
thefts, and other sins.

[Deuteronomy 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 23:12</span></span>

Thou shalt have also a place without the camp,.... A place prepared, as
the Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan, provided on purpose for the use
hereafter suggested; so Ben Melech:

whither thou shalt go forth abroad; to do the necessities of nature,
which they were to do without the camp, not in any place they thought
fit and most convenient, but what was appointed for that purpose.

[Deuteronomy 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 23:13</span></span>

And thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon,.... A nail or spike, some
kind of instrument to make a hole in the ground with, which was fastened
to the sword upon their loins; which was to be instead of a spade or
mattock to dig with:

and it shall be, when thou shall ease thyself abroad; without the camp,
in the place appointed for that use, whenever nature required such an
action to be performed:

thou shall dig therewith; with, the paddle, an hole in the earth: the
Essenes used, according to Josephus, to make it a foot deep with a spade
or mattock, and to everyone that was newly admitted among them, a little
pickaxe was given for that purpose (r):

and shalt turn back; having eased nature:

and cover that which cometh from thee; their dung, with the earth they
dug out of the hole they made. This law was made to preserve modesty and
decency becoming men, and not act like brute beasts, as well as
cleanliness in the camp, and, the health of themselves and their fellow
soldiers; and that, they might not be offensive to the smell, as well as
pernicious to the health of one another; and especially for a reason
that follows in [Deu 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#014.md); so
Maimonides (s) says, the intention of this law is especially
cleanliness, and to avoid nastiness, filthiness, and impurities of every
kind, that men might not be like the brute animals.

[Deuteronomy 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 23:14</span></span>

For the Lord thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp,.... In the
tabernacle, which moved when the host marched after the camps of Judah
and Reuben, and before those of Ephraim and Dan, in the midst of them:
this was the position of it while in the wilderness, and afterwards when
they came into the land of Canaan, and went to war with their enemies,
the ark sometimes went with them, the symbol of the divine Presence; and
here it is made a reason why they should avoid all uncleanness, since
the holy God, or that token of his, presence, was in the midst of them:

to deliver thee, and give up thine enemies before thee: to save them
from falling into the hands of their enemies, and to deliver their
enemies into their hands, which depended not upon their numbers,
strength, and skill, but on the Presence, providence, and power of God
with them; wherefore, as the above writer (t) observes, by these actions
(of purity and cleanliness) God meant to confirm the faith of those that
engaged in war, that the divine Majesty dwelt among them; for which
reason such orders were strictly to be observed by them:

therefore shall thy camp be holy; both in a moral and ceremonial sense:

that he see no unclean thing in thee; whether natural, moral, or
ceremonial; the word here used signifies such nakedness as is forbidden
to be uncovered, [Lev 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#006.md). Hence
Maimonides (u) applies it to whoredom; for he says,"by this phrase God
meant to deter and dehort from whoredom, which is too usual and common
among soldiers, as long as they are absent from their own houses; that
therefore we may be delivered and abstain from those impure works, God
has commanded such things to be done, which may bring to our remembrance
that his glory dwells in the midst of us:"

and turn away from thee; and so they fall into the hands of their
enemies, and become an easy prey to them, their God having forsaken
them; and that this might not be their case, care should be taken not to
offend him, and cause him to depart from them.

[Deuteronomy 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 23:15</span></span>

Thou shall not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from
his master unto thee. That is, one that has been used ill by a cruel and
tyrannical master, and was in danger of his life with him, or of being
lamed by him, and therefore obliged to make his escape from him on that
account; such an one, when he fell into the hands of an Israelite, was
not to be taken and bound, and sent back to his master again, but was to
be retained till his master's anger subsided; or however until inquiry
could be made into the cause of the difference between him and his
master, and matters be made up between them to mutual satisfaction; or
if it appeared that the flight of the servant was just, and it was not
safe for him to return to his master, then he was to be used as
hereafter directed; for it cannot be thought that this law was made to
encourage and protect every idle, disobedient, and fugitive servant,
which would be very sinful and unjust: the Jewish writers generally
understand it of the servants of idolaters fleeing for the sake of
religion; Onkelos renders it,"a servant of the people,''of Heathen
people; the Targum of Jonathan is,"thou shalt not deliver a stranger
(i.e. a proselyte of righteousness, as Maimonides (w) calls this
servant) into the hands of those that worship idols, but he shall be
delivered by you, that he may be under the shadow of my Shechinah,
because that he fled from the worship of his idol.''Jarchi makes mention
of another sense; that it may be understood of"a Canaanitish servant of
an Israelite that flees (from his master) without the land, where he was
not obliged to go with him, and serve him against his will; but I
suppose a proselyte is meant;''and much more then will this hold good of
an Hebrew servant in such circumstances. Aben Ezra interprets this of a
servant not an Israelite, who, in time of war, flees from his master,
not an Israelite also, unto the camp of Israel, and that for the glory
of the divine name which is called upon Israel; such an one, though a
servant, might not be delivered to his master.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 23:16</span></span>

He shall dwell in thee, even among you,.... This seems to confirm the
sense of it, being a stranger, a: proselyte servant that is here spoken
of, since the law provides for his dwelling among the Israelites:

in that place he shall choose, in one of thy gates, where it liketh him
best: he was not to be detained by the person that took him up in his
own house, or be obliged to dwell in any certain place under, a
restraint, but he might take up his abode in any of the cities of
Israel, which would be most for his good, profit, and advantage:

thou shalt not oppress him; by words, as the Targum of Jonathan
adds,"calling him a fugitive servant, or by any opprobrious name.''

[Deuteronomy 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 23:17</span></span>

There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel,.... The word for
"whore" is "kedeshah", which properly signifies an "holy" one; and here,
by an antiphrasis, an unholy, an impure person, one that is defiled by
man; See Gill on [Gen 38:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#018.md). Jarchi
interprets the word, one that makes herself common, that is sanctified,
or set apart; that is, one that separates herself for such service, and
prostitutes herself to everyone that passes by: but some understand this
not of common harlots in the streets, but of sacred whores, or such as
were consecrated to Heathen deities, as such there were to Venus. Strabo
(x) tells us that the temple of Venus at Corinth was so rich, that more
than a thousand of those sacred harlots were kept, whom men and women
had devoted to that goddess; and so a multitude of the same sort were at
Comana, which he calls little Corinth (y); now these of all harlots
being the most abominable are forbidden to be among the daughters of
Israel:

nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel: by the same rule that "kedeshah"
is rendered "a whore" in the preceding clause, "kadesh" should be
rendered "an whoremonger" here, as in the Septuagint and Vulgate Latin
versions; though Aben Ezra interprets it passively, one that is lain
with, and Jarchi one that is prepared to lie with a male, that
prostitutes his body in this unnatural way; and it looks as if there
were such sort of persons sacred to idols, since we read of the houses
of the sodomites, which were by, or rather in the house of the Lord,
[Kg2 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#007.md).

Thou shall not bring the hire of a whore,.... Which was given to her as
a reward for the use of her body:

or the price of a dog; not of the firstborn of a dog, the price for the
redemption of it, as some; nor for the loan of a hunting dog, or a
shepherd's dog for breed, as Josephus (z) interprets this law. Abarbinel
understands it figuratively of a sodomite, comparable to a dog, for his
uncleanness and impudence; see [Rev
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#015.md); and the price of such an one
the gain he got by the prostitution of his body to unnatural lusts; and
so as the hire of a whore answers to one in [Deu
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#017.md), the price of a dog to a
sodomite here; and in this he is followed by some, nor is it a sense to
be despised; though the Jews (a) understand it literally of a dog, and
of the exchange of another creature with that; so Onkelos renders
it,"the exchange of a dog:''now neither of these might a man bring

into the house of the Lord thy God for any vow; that is, when a man
vowed to offer any sacrifice to the Lord, it was not to be anything that
was given to a whore as her hire; as, for instance, as Jarchi, if he
gave her for her hire a lamb, it was not fit to be offered; which agrees
with the Jewish (b) canons,"what is the hire of a whore? if one says to
a whore, take this lamb for thy hire, though an hundred, they are all
forbidden; and so if one says to his neighbour, lo, this lamb is thine,
that thine handmaid may lie with my a servant, Rabbi says it is not the
hire of a whore, but the wise men say it is.--If he gives her money, lo,
this is free; wines, oils, and fine flour, and the like, that are
offered on the altar, are forbidden; (but the commentators say (c),
wheat, olives, and grapes, out of which fine flour, oil, and wine are
made, are free;) if he gives her consecrated things, lo, these are free,
birds, they are forbidden.''Now this law seems to be made in opposition
to the customs and practices of the Phoenicians and Canaanites, whose
land the Israelites were going to inhabit; whose women, as we are told
(d), used to prostitute themselves in the temples of their idols, and
dedicate there the hire of their bodies to their gods, thinking thereby
to appease their deities and obtain good things for themselves; and the
like did the. Babylonians and Assyrians; See Gill on [Mic
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#007); so it is asked (e.md),"what is the
price of a dog? if a man says to his neighbour, take this lamb for that
dog; so if two partners divide, one takes ten (lambs), and the other
nine and a dog; what is in lieu of the dog is forbidden, but those that
are taken with him are free:''a whore and a dog are fitly put together,
because both are libidinous, impure, and impudent; perhaps the vileness
and baseness of the creature is chiefly regarded in this law, to keep up
the credit and veneration of sacrifices as sacred things; and it may be
in reference to the worship of this creature, as by the Egyptians, who
are said to worship a dog, their god Anubis (f), the image of which had
a dog's head on it; or to its being offered in sacrifice to idols, as it
was by others; the Colophonians sacrificed the whelps of dogs to their
goddess Enodius, as others did to Enyalius or Mars (g):

for even both these are an abomination to the Lord thy God; both the
hire of the whore and the price of the dog, when brought as a sacrifice
to him; the one being a breach of the moral law, and the other tending
to bring into contempt the sacrifices of the ceremonial law, if not a
favouring idolatry, than which nothing is more abominable to God, who
cannot endure anything evil, base, and impure.

[Deuteronomy 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 23:19</span></span>

Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother,.... One of the same
nation and religion, and who is in poor and necessitous circumstances,
and wants either food for himself and family, or money to carry on his
husbandry, till such times as the fruits of his ground will bring him in
a sufficiency for his support, and the payment of what he borrows, and
which is to be lent him without any interest: as the Jews were chiefly
employed in husbandry, and not merchandise, they had but little occasion
to borrow, and when they did could not afford to pay interest, as
persons concerned in merchandise, whose gains are great, are able to do;
and it is but reasonable that such persons should; but that the
Israelites, when poor and in distress, might not be bowed down under
their burdens, this law is made for their relief:

usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of anything that is lent upon
usury; this takes in all sorts of usury, whether what is lent be money
or food, or anything else, no interest was to be taken for it; See Gill
on [Lev 25:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#036.md); See Gill on [Lev
25:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#037.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">deu 23:20</span></span>

Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury,.... To any Gentile, though
some Jewish writers except the Edomites and Ishmaelites, as being
brethren, and restrain it to the seven nations of Canaan; but it seems
to design one that was not an Israelite, or a proselyte of
righteousness, and especially to regard such that traded and
merchandised, as the Gentiles very much did, and especially their
neighbours the Phoenicians; and of such it was lawful to take interest,
as it was but reasonable, when they gained much by the money they lent
them, and as it is but reasonable should be the case among Christians in
such circumstances; this is to be regarded not as a precept, but as a
permission:

but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon usury; which is repeated,
that it might be taken notice of, and carefully observed:

that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all that thou settest thine hand
unto, in the land whither thou goest to possess it; for their charity,
humanity, and the kind usage of their poor brethren in distress, would
not pass unnoticed by the Lord; but he would make the land they tilled
fruitful, and their vineyards and oliveyards to produce abundance, and
their flocks and their herds to increase greatly, which would be
sufficient and more than a recompence for all that they had freely lent
unto their brethren, without taking any usury of them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">deu 23:21</span></span>

When thou shalt vow a vow unto the Lord thy God,.... Which must be of
things in a man's power to perform, and of what are lawful to be done,
and according to the mind and will of God revealed in his word, and
agreeably to the manner of worship prescribed by him; as that he will
offer such a sacrifice, a freewill offering to him, and the like,
besides what he was bound to do, or give such and such things for the
repair of the sanctuary, or for the relief of the poor; See Gill on [Num
30:2](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#002.md). This law is thought by Aben Ezra
to be repeated on the mention of the hire of a whore, &c. being
forbidden to be brought for a vow, [Deu
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#018.md),

thou shall not slack to pay it; or delay the payment of it, but do it
immediately; since zeal and affection might abate, and there might not
be hereafter an ability to perform, or death might come and prevent it;
the Targum of Jonathan adds, at the three feasts, that is, of the
passover, pentecost, and tabernacles; and the Jewish writers (h) say,
that no man transgresses this precept respecting the delay of paying a
vow, until the three feasts have passed:

for the Lord thy God will surely require it of thee; exact the payment
of it, and expect it, insist upon the performance of it, and punish for
neglect:

and it would be sin in thee; guilt of sin would be contracted, and
punishment inflicted; Aben Ezra interprets it of the latter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">deu 23:22</span></span>

But if thou shalt forbear to vow,.... That a man might do, though there
was ability; it was expected indeed that men should vow and bring
freewill offerings in proportion to their ability; whether they were of
the greater sort, of the herd and flock, or of fowls, or even of fine
flour, these were acceptable to the Lord: but if they were not vowed and
brought:

it shall be no sin in thee; no charge of guilt be brought or punishment
laid; it should not be reckoned a crime, nor be punishable in any
respect, and especially where there was a willing mind and no ability;
otherwise negligence, niggardliness, and ingratitude, are not well
pleasing in the sight of God.

[Deuteronomy 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">deu 23:23</span></span>

That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and perform,....
Which were in their power to perform and lawful to do; and this is
observed to make them watchful and cautious, and not be rash in making
vows, since, when once they were made, an exact and rigid performance of
them was expected; see [Ecc 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#004.md),

even a freewill offering, according as thou hast vowed unto the Lord thy
God, which thou hast promised with thy mouth; be it what it will, as to
the matter of it, it was to be paid, and in the manner as it was vowed
and promised. Aben Ezra observes, that every vow is a freewill offering,
but not every freewill offering a vow; the Targum of Jonathan enumerates
the several things to be performed, sin offerings, trespass offerings,
burnt offerings, and oblations of holy things, and drink offerings, and
gifts of the house of the sanctuary, and alms to the poor.

[Deuteronomy 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">deu 23:24</span></span>

When thou comest into thy neighbour's vineyard,.... To take a walk in it
for recreation, and to see how the vines flourish, and what sort of
fruit and what quantity of it they bear; being invited thither by the
owner, or occasionally passing that way stepped in, and even it may be
on purpose to taste the fruits of the vine and quench thirst and satisfy
appetite:

then thou mayest eat grapes thy fill, at thine own pleasure; as many as
they would, till nature was satisfied:

but thou shall not put any in thy vessel; to carry away, to be eaten by
them or theirs at another time and place; they were to put none into
their pockets or into their baskets, as the Targum of Jonathan, or
whatsoever vessel they might have with them in the vineyard. Jarchi
says, the Scripture speaks of a workman, and only at the time of
gathering the grapes, when he was putting into his master's vessels, and
might not put any into his own, and carry away; so the Jewish writers
(i) generally interpret it of a workman only, and of his eating those
things in which he works, and not of such as pass by the way; so the
Targums: and there are many traditions in the Misnah (k) concerning this
affair; as that by this law a workman might eat while in his work, as
the ox may while it is treading out the corn, and when his work is
perfect; and that he may eat of what he is employed about; only if he is
at work upon figs, he may not eat of grapes, and if on grapes, he may
not eat of figs; nor might he eat more than his hire came to; and that
he might make a covenant for his son and daughter, servant and handmaid,
adult (that they shall take money and not eat), and for his wife,
because they are endowed with knowledge; but not for his son and
daughter, servant and maidservant, minors, because they are not: but
Josephus (l), their countryman, better interprets this law, who says,
that travellers, of those that passed by the way, were not forbidden
tasting ripe fruits, and even were permitted to fill themselves with
them as if their own, whether they were of the country or strangers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">deu 23:25</span></span>

When thou comest into the standing corn of thy neighbour,.... Passest
through it to go to some other place, the road lying through it, as it
often does through standing corn; so Christ and his disciples are said
to go through the corn, [Mat 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001.md); but
Jarchi says this Scripture speaks of a workman also, and so the Targum
of Jonathan,"when thou goest in to take thine hire according to work in
thy neighbour's standing corn;''but the other sense is best, and is
confirmed and illustrated by the instance given, as well as best agrees
with what follows:

then thou mayest pluck the ears with thine hand; the ears of wheat, and
rub them, to separate the grain from the husk or beard, and eat it, as
did the disciples of Christ; [Luk 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#001.md);
to satisfy hunger: but thou shall not move a sickle unto thy neighbour's
standing corn to cut it down and carry any of it off; which would have
been an unjust thing.
