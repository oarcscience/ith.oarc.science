### [Matthew Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 1:1</span></span>

The book of the generation of Jesus Christ,.... This is the genuine
title of the book, which was put to it by the Evangelist himself; for
the former seems to be done by another hand. This book is an account,
not of the divine, but human generation of Christ; and not merely of his
birth, which lies in a very little compass; nor of his genealogy, which
is contained in this chapter; but also of his whole life and actions, of
what was said, done, and suffered by him. It is an Hebrew way of
speaking, much like that in [Gen 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#001.md)
and which the Septuagint render by the same phrase as here; and as that
was the book of the generation of the first Adam; this is the book of
the generation of the second Adam. The Jews call their blasphemous
history of the life of Jesus, "The book of the generations of Jesus"
(o). This account of Christ begins with the name of the Messiah, well
known to the Jews,

the son of David; not only to the Scribes and Pharisees, the more
learned part of the nation, but to the common people, even to persons of
the meanest rank and figure among them. See [Mat
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#027.md). Nothing is more common in the
Jewish writings, than for "the son of David" to stand alone for the
Messiah; it would be endless to cite or refer to all the testimonies of
this kind; only take the following (p),

"R. Jochanan says, in the generation in which "the son of David" comes,
the disciples of the wise men shall be lessened, and the rest, their
eyes shall fail with grief and sorrow, and many calamities and severe
decrees shall be renewed; when the first visitation is gone, a second
will hasten to come. It is a tradition of the Rabbins (about) the week
(of years) in which "the son of David" comes, that in the first year
this scripture will be fulfilled, [Amo
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#007.md). "I will rain upon one city", &c.
in the second, arrows of famine will be sent forth; in the third there
will be a great famine, and men, women and children, holy men and men of
business will die, and the law will be forgotten by those who learn it;
in the fourth there will be plenty and not plenty; in the fifth there
will be great plenty, and they shall eat and drink and rejoice, and the
law shall return to them that learn it; in the sixth there will be
voices (or thunders;) in the seventh there will be wars; and in the
going out of the seventh the "son of David" comes. The tradition of R.
Judah says, In the generation in which "the son of David" comes, the
house of the congregation (the school or synagogue) shall become a
brothel house, Galilee shall be destroyed, and Gabalene shall become
desolate; and the men of Gabul (or the border) shall go about from city
to city, and shall find no mercy; and the wisdom of the scribes shall
stink; and they that are afraid to sin shall be despised; and the face
of that generation shall be as the face of a dog, and truth shall fail,
as it is said, [Isa 59:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#015.md) --The
tradition of R. Nehorai says, In the generation in which "the son of
David" comes, young men shall make ashamed the faces of old men, and old
men shall stand before young men, the daughter shall rise up against her
mother, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; nor will a
son reverence his father. The tradition of R. Nehemiah says, In the
generation in which "the son of David" comes, impudence will increase,
and the honourable will deal wickedly, and the whole kingdom will return
to the opinion of the Sadducees, and there will be no reproof. --It is a
tradition of the Rabbins, that "the son of David" will not come, until
traitorous practices are increased, or the disciples are lessened or
until the smallest piece of money fails from the purse, or until
redemption is despaired of.''

In which passage, besides the proof for which it is cited, may be
observed, how exactly the description of the age of the Messiah, as
given by the Jews themselves, agrees with the generation in which Jesus
the true Messiah came; who as he was promised to David, and it was
expected he should descend from him, so he did according to the flesh;
God raised him up of his seed, [Rom
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#003.md) it follows,

The son of Abraham. Abraham was the first to whom a particular promise
was made, that the Messiah should spring from, [Gen
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#018.md). The first promise in [Gen
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015.md) only signified that he should be
the seed of the woman; and it would have been sufficient for the
fulfilment of it, if he had been born of any woman, in whatsoever
nation, tribe, or family; but by the promise made to Abraham he was to
descend from him, as Jesus did; who took upon him the seed of Abraham,
[Heb 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#016.md) or assumed an human nature
which sprung from him, and is therefore truly the son of Abraham. The
reason why Christ is first called the son of David, and then the son of
Abraham, is partly because the former was a more known name of the
Messiah; and partly that the transition to the genealogy of Christ might
be more easy and natural, beginning with Abraham, whom the Jews call (q)
the "head of the genealogy", and the root and foundation of it, as
Matthew here makes him to be; wherefore a Jew cannot be displeased with
the Evangelist for beginning the genealogy of our Lord at, Abraham.

[Matthew 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 1:2</span></span>

Abraham begat Isaac,.... The descent of Christ from Abraham is in the
line of Isaac; Abraham begat Ishmael before Isaac, and others after him,
but they are not mentioned; because the Messiah was not to spring from
any of them, but from Isaac, of whom it is said, "in Isaac shall thy
seed be called", [Gen 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#012.md) and who,
as he was a progenitor, so an eminent type of Christ; being Abraham's
only beloved son; and particularly in the binding, sacrifice and
deliverance of him.

Isaac begat Jacob. The genealogy of Christ proceeds from Isaac, in the
line of Jacob. Isaac begat Esau, as well as Jacob, and they two were
twins, but one was loved, and the other hated; wherefore no mention is
made of Esau, he had no concern in the Messiah, nor was he to spring
from him, but from Jacob, or Israel, by whose name he is sometimes
called, [Isa 49:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#003.md)

Jacob begat Judas and his brethren. The lineage of Christ is carried on
from Jacob in the line of Judah; the reason of which is, because it was
particularly prophesied that the Messiah, Shiloh, the prince and chief
ruler, should be of him, [Gen 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md)
[Ch1 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#002.md). And it is evident beyond all
contradiction, that our Lord sprung from his tribe, [Heb
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#014.md). The reason why the brethren of
Judah, who were eleven in number, are mentioned, when the brethren of
Isaac and Jacob are not, is, because though the Messiah did not spring
from them, yet the promise of him was made to the twelve tribes, who all
expected him, and to whom he was sent, and came. These made but one body
of men, and therefore, though the Messiah came from the tribe of Judah,
yet he is said to be of them all, [Rom
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004.md).

[Matthew 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 1:3</span></span>

And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar,.... The genealogical account
of Christ goes on from Judah in the line of Phares, with whom Zara is
mentioned; not because they were twins, for so were Jacob and Esau, and
yet the latter is taken no notice of; but it may be because of what
happened at their birth, see [Gen
38:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#028.md). But the line of the Messiah was
in Phares, and very rightly is he put in the genealogy of Christ, the
Jews themselves being witnesses; who expressly say, that "the Messiah
comes from him." These two are said to be begotten of Thamar,
daughter-in-law to Judah; who, though she was a Canaanitish woman, has
the honour to be named in the genealogy of Christ, who came to save
Gentiles as well as Jews: nor can the Jews reproach our Evangelist for
putting her into the account; since they themselves frequently
acknowledge that the Messiah was to spring from her: they say, (r).

"there are two women from whom come David the king, and Solomon, and the
king Messiah; and these two are Thamar and Ruth.''

Jonathan Ben Uzziel on [Gen 38:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#006.md) says,
that Thamar was the daughter of Shem the great.

And Phares begat Esrom; called Hezron, [Rut
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#018.md) where the same phrase is used as
here. He had another son called Hamul, [Ch1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#005.md) but the account proceeds from
Phares, in the line of Esrom.

And Esrom begat Aram; called Ram in [Rut
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#018.md) where the same way of speaking is
used as here. Esrom also besides him begat Jerahmeel, Chelubai, or
Caleb, and Segub, [Ch1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#009.md) but these
are not in the line. Elihu, who conversed with Job, is said to be of the
kindred of Ram, [Job 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#002.md) whether the
same with Ram or Aram, may be inquired.

[Matthew 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 1:4</span></span>

And Aram begat Aminadab,.... Which, with what follows in this verse,
exactly agrees with the genealogical account in [Rut
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#019.md).

[Matthew 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 1:5</span></span>

And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab,.... That Salmon begat Boaz, is affirmed
in [Rut 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#021.md) but it is not there said,
nor any where else in the Old Testament, as here, that he begat him of
Rahab, that is, of Rahab the harlot. This the Evangelist had from
tradition, or from the Jewish records. That the Messiah was to spring
from Boaz is asserted by the Jewish writers (s); and they also own that
Rahab was married to a prince in Israel, which some say (t) was Joshua:
they pretend that she was ten years of age when the Israelites came out
of Egypt; that she played the harlot all the forty years they were in
the wilderness, and was married to Joshua upon the destruction of
Jericho. To excuse this marriage with a Canaanitish woman, they tell us,
she was not of the seven nations with whom marriage was forbid; and
moreover, that she became a proselyte when the spies were received by
her: they own that some very great persons of their nation sprung from
her, as Jeremiah, Maaseiah, Hanameel, Shallum, Baruch, Ezekiel, Neriah,
Seraiah, and Huldah the prophetess. The truth of the matter is, she
became the wife of Salmon, or Salma, as he is called, [Ch1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#011.md). And in the Targum on [Rut
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#020.md) is said to be of Bethlehem; he
was the son of Nahshon or Naasson, a famous prince in Judah, and the
head and captain of the tribe, [Num
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#007.md) [Num
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#012.md). And from Rahab sprung the
Messiah, another instance of a Gentile in the genealogy of Christ; and a
third follows.

And Booz begat Obed of Ruth; who was a Moabitess. It is a notion that
generally obtains among the Jews (u), that she was the daughter of
Eglon, grandson of Balak, king of Moab; and it is often taken notice of
by them (w), that the king Messiah should descend from her; and also
other persons of note, as David, Hezekiah, Josiah, Hananiah, Mishael,
Azariah, and Daniel; wherefore the mentioning of her in this genealogy,
cannot be said by them to be impertinent.

And Obed begat Jesse. Jesse is thought to be, not the immediate son of
Obed, but to be of the fourth generation from him; though no others are
mentioned between them in Ruth, any more than here. A Jewish writer
observes (x), that

"the wise men of the Gentiles say, that there were other generations
between them; perhaps, says he, they have taken this from the wise men
of Israel, and so it is thought.''

Now notwithstanding this, Jesse may be said to be begotten by Obed, as
Hezekiah's posterity, who were carried captive into Babylon, are said to
be begotten by him, [Isa 39:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#007.md) though
they were a remove of several generations from him. However, Jesse is
rightly put among the progenitors of Christ, since the Messiah was to be
a rod of his stem, and the branch of his roots, and is called the root
of Jesse, [Isa 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md) which words are
interpreted of the Messiah, by many of the Jewish writers (y); and to
this day the Jews pray for him in their synagogues under the name of ,
"the son of Jesse" (z).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 1:6</span></span>

And Jesse begat David the king,.... The descent of the Messiah runs in
the line of David, the youngest of Jesse's sons, who was despised by his
brethren, and overlooked and neglected by his father; but God chose him,
and anointed him to be king, and set him on the throne of Israel; hence
he is called "David the king"; as also because he was the first king
that was of the tribe of Judah, and in the genealogy of Christ, and was
an eminent type of the king Messiah, who is sometimes called by the same
name, [Eze 34:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#024.md) and who was to be his
son, as Jesus is, and also right heir to his throne and kingdom.

And David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;
which was Bathsheba, though not named; either because she was well
known, or because of the sin she had been guilty of, which would easily
be revived by mentioning her name: our translators have rightly
supplied, "that had been", and not as the Vulgate Latin, which supplies
it, "that was the wife of Urias", for Solomon was begotten of her, not
while she was the wife of Uriah, but when she was the wife of David.

[Matthew 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 1:7</span></span>

And Solomon begat Roboam,.... Called Rehoboam, [Kg1
11:43](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#043.md) of Naamah an Ammonitess, [Kg1
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#021.md).

And Roboam begat Abia, sometimes called Abijam, as in [Kg1
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#031.md), sometimes Abijah, [Ch2
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#016.md) and sometimes, as here, Abia,
[Ch1 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#010.md). Him Rehoboam begat of
Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom, [Kg1
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#002.md) called Michaiah, the daughter of
Uriel, [Ch2 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#002.md). Maachah and Michaiah
being the same name; or else she went by two names, as her father did.

And Abia begat Asa, who was a good king; his mother's name is the same
with the name of his father's mother; and perhaps it is not his proper
mother, but his grandmother who is meant in [Kg1
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#010.md). He is wrongly called Asaph in
the Persic and Ethiopic versions, and in one copy.

[Matthew 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 1:8</span></span>

And Asa begat Josaphat,.... Called Jehoshaphat, [Kg1
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#024.md) whom Asa begat of Azubah, the
daughter of Shilhi, [Kg1 22:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#042.md). He
also was a very good prince.

And Josaphat begat Joram; called Jehoram, [Kg1
22:50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#050.md) to whom his father gave the
kingdom, because he was the firstborn, [Ch2
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#003.md).

And Joram begat Ozias; called Uzziah, [Ch2
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#001.md) and Azariah, [Kg2
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#001.md). He was not the immediate son of
Joram; there were three kings between them, Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah,
which are here omitted; either because of the curse denounced on Ahab's
family, into which Joram married, whose idolatry was punished to the
third or fourth generation; or because these were princes of no good
character; or because their names were not in the Jewish registers. Nor
does this omission at all affect the design of the Evangelist, which is
to show that Jesus, the true Messiah, is of the house of David; nor
ought the Jews to complain of it, as they do (a) since such omissions
are to be met with in the Old Testament, particularly in [Ezr
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#002.md) where six generations are omitted
at once; and which is taken notice of by one of their own genealogical
writers, whose words are these (b);

"we see in the genealogy of Ezra that he hath skipped over seven
generations (perhaps it should be "six" and not "seven", since six are
only omitted) from Ahitub to Ahitub.''

Nor is it any objection that Joram is said to beget Ozias, which he may
be said to do in the like sense, as has been before observed of
Hezekiah, [Isa 39:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#007.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 1:9</span></span>

And Ozias begat Joatham,.... Called Jotham, [Kg2
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#007.md) him Ozias begat of Jerushah, the
daughter of Zadok, [Kg2 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#033.md).

And Joatham begat Achaz, or Ahaz, [Kg2
15:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#038.md) to him the sign was given, and
the famous prophecy of the Messiah, [Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014.md).

And Achaz begat Ezekias, or Hezekiah, [Kg2
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#020.md) him Ahaz begat of Abi, the
daughter of Zachariah, [Kg2 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#002.md). He
was a very religious king, and had that singular favour from God to have
fifteen years added to his days, [Isa
38:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#005.md).

And Ezekias begat Manasses,.... Or Manasseh, [Kg2
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#021.md). Him Hezekiah begat of
Hephzibah, [Kg2 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#001.md). He was very
remarkable both for his sins, and for his humiliation on account of
them.

And Manasses begat Amon, of Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of
Jotbah, [Kg2 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#019.md). He was a very
wicked prince.

And Amon begat Josias, or Josiah of Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of
Boscath, [Kg2 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#001.md). He was a very
pious king, and was prophesied of by name some hundreds of years before
he was born, [Kg1 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#002.md).

And Josias begat Jechonias,.... This Jechonias is the same with
Jehoiakim, the son of Josias, called so by Pharaohnecho, when he made
him king, whose name before was Eliakim, [Kg2
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#034.md) begat of Zebudah, the daughter
of Pedaiah of Rumah, [Kg2 23:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#036.md).

and his brethren. These were Johanan, Zedekiah, and Shallum. Two of them
were kings, one reigned before him, viz. Shallum, who is called
Jehoahaz, [Kg2 23:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#030.md) compared with
[Jer 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#011.md), the other, viz. Zedekiah,
called before Mattaniah, reigned after his son Jehoiakim: these being
both kings, is the reason why his brethren are mentioned; as well as to
distinguish him from Jechonias in the next verse; who does not appear to
have had any brethren: these were

about the time they were carried away to Babylon, which is not to be
connected with the word "begat": for Josiah did not beget Jeconiah and
his brethren at that time, for he had been dead some years before; nor
with Jechonias, for he never was carried away into Babylon, but died in
Judea, and slept with his fathers, [Kg2
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#006.md) but with the phrase "his
brethren": and may be rendered thus, supposing understood, "which were
at", or "about the carrying away to Babylon", or the Babylonish
captivity.

[Matthew 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 1:12</span></span>

And after they were brought to Babylon,.... Not Jechonias, but the
father of Jechonias, and the Jews.

Jechonias begat Salathiel. Not Jechonias mentioned in the former verse,
but his son, called Jehoiachin, [Kg2
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#006.md) and Coniah, [Jer
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#024.md) both which are rendered
Jechonias by the Septuagint in [Ch2
36:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#008.md) and he is so called, [Ch1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#016). Abulpharagius (c.md) calls him
Junachir, and says he is the same who in Matthew is called Juchonia; and
he asserts him to be the father of Daniel the Prophet. But here a
considerable difficulty arises, how he can be said to beget Salathiel,
called Shealtiel, [Hag 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001.md) when he was
pronounced "childless", [Jer 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#030.md). To
remove which, it may be observed, that the sentence pronounced may be
considered with this tacit condition or proviso, if he repented not. Now
the Jews have a tradition (d) that he did repent in prison, upon which
the sentence was revoked; but there is no need to suppose this, though
it is not an unreasonable supposition; for the sentence does not imply
that he should have no children, but rather that he should, as will
appear upon reading the whole; "thus saith the Lord, write ye this man
childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days; for no man of his
seed shall prosper, sitting on the throne of David, and ruling any more
in Judah". Besides, the Hebrew word rendered "childless", comes from
which signifies "to make naked" or "bare" and so denotes not only such
as have no children, or are bereft of them, but such as are by any
providence stripped of the blessings of life, and are left bare,
destitute, and unhappy, as Jechonias and his posterity were: however,
the Jews have no reason to find fault with our Evangelist, since
Salathiel is expressly called Jechonias's son, [Ch1
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#017.md) either he was his proper natural
son, or, to use their way of speaking, "the son of the kingdom" (e),
that is, his heir and successor in the kingdom, as some have thought;
since it looks as if he was the son of Neri, [Luk
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#027.md) though the chronicle of Jedidaeus
of Alexandria (f), or Philo the Jew, says, that Jechonias was called
Neri, because Ner, or the lamp of David, shined in him, which had been
almost extinguished.

And Salathiel begat Zorobabel. This account perfectly agrees with many
passages in the Old Testament, where Zorobabel is called the son of
Shealtiel or Salathiel, [Ezr 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#002.md) [Hag
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001.md) which is sufficient to justify the
Evangelist in this assertion. There is indeed a difficulty which as much
presses the Jews as the Christians, and that is, that Zorobabel is
reckoned as the son of Pedaiah, [Ch1
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#019.md) for the solution of which a noted
Jewish commentator (g) observes, that

"in Haggai, Zachariah and Ezra, Zorobabel is called the son of
Shealtiel, because he was his son's son; for Pedaiah was the son of
Shealtiel, and Zorobabel the son of Pedaiah; and do not you observe
(adds he) that in many places children's children are mentioned as
children?''

No doubt there are many instances of this; but to me it seems that
Pedaiah was not the son of Shealtiel, but his brother, [Ch1
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#017.md). And I greatly suspect that
Shealtiel had no children of his own, since none are mentioned; and that
he adopted his brother Pedaiah's son Zorobabel, and made him his heir
and successor in the government of Judah. However, it is certain, as a
genealogical writer (h) among the Jews observes, that he was of the
son's sons of Jechonias, king of Judah, from whom our Evangelist makes
him to descend.

And Zorobabel begat Abiud,.... The children of Zorobabel are said in
[Ch1 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#019.md), to be Meshullam, and
Hananiah, and Shelomith their sister, but no mention is made of Abiud:
he seems to be the same with Meshullam the eldest son, who might have
two names; nor is this unlikely, since it was usual, especially about
the time of the Babylonish captivity, for men to have more names than
one, as may be observed in Daniel and others, [Dan
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#007.md) where they went by one, and in
Judea by another.

And Abiud begat Eliakim, &c. From hence to the 16th verse the genealogy
is carried down to Joseph, the husband of Mary; which account must be
taken from the genealogical tables of the Jews, to which recourse might
be had, and with which it agrees; or otherwise the Jews would have
cavilled at it; but I do not find any objections made by them to it.
That there were genealogical books or tables kept by the Jews is
certain, from the following instances (i);

"Simeon ben Azzai says, I found in Jerusalem, , "a volume of
genealogies", and there was written in it, &c.''

Again (k), says R. Levi,

"they found a "volume of genealogies" in Jerusalem, and there was
written in it that Hillell came from David; Ben Jarzaph from Asaph; Ben
Tzitzith Hacceseth from Abner; Ben Cobesin from Ahab; Ben Calba Shebuah
from Caleb; R. Jannai from Eli; R. Chayah Rabba from the children of
Shephatiah, the son of Abital; R. Jose be Rabbi Chelphetha from the
children of Jonadab, the son of Rechab; and R. Nehemiah from Nehemiah
the Tirshathite.''

Once more (l), says R. Chana bar Chanma, when the holy blessed God
causes his

"Shechinah to dwell, he does not cause it to dwell but upon families,
"which are genealogized" in Israel.''

Now if Matthew's account had not been true, it might easily have been
refuted by these records. The author of the old (m) Nizzachon takes
notice of the close of this genealogy, but finds no fault with it; only
that it is carried down to Joseph, and not to Mary; which may be
accounted for by a rule of their own (n), "the mother's family is not
called a family", whereas the father's is. It is very remarkable that
the Jewish Targum (o) traces the descent of the Messiah from the family
of David in the line of Zorobabel, as Matthew does; and reckons the same
number of generations, wanting one, from Zorobabel to the Messiah, as
the Evangelist does, from Zorobabel to Jesus; according to Matthew, the
genealogy stands thus, Zorobabel, Abiud, Eliakim, Azor, Sadoc, Achim,
Eliud, Eleazar, Matthan, Jacob, Joseph, Jesus; and according to the
Targum the order is this,

"Zorobabel, Hananiah, Jesaiah, Rephaiah, Arnon, Obadiah, Shecaniah,
Shemnigh, Neariah, Elioenai, Anani; this is the king Messiah, who is to
be revealed.''

The difference of names may be accounted for by their having two names,
as before observed. This is a full proof, that, according to the Jews
own account, and expectation, the Messiah must be come many years and
ages ago.

And Jacob begat Joseph,.... According to an old tradition mentioned by
(p) Epiphanins, this Jacob, the father of Joseph, was named Panther, and
which name perhaps is originally Jewish; and it may be observed, that
Joseph is sometimes called by the Jewish writers Pandera (q), and Jesus
, the son of Pandira (r). It has created some difficulty with
interpreters that Jacob should be here said to beget Joseph, when Joseph
in Luke is said to be the son of Eli. Some have thought Joseph's father
had two names, one was Jacob, and the other Eli; others take them to be
two different persons, and suppose that Joseph was the natural son of
the one, and the legal son of the other, either by marriage, or by
adoption, or by the law of the brother's wife, [Deu
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005.md). But the truth of the matter is,
that not Joseph, but Jesus, is by Luke called the son of Eli, as will be
made to appear in its proper place. Joseph, who is here called the
husband of Mary, because he not only espoused her, but, upon the advice
and encouragement of the Angel, took her to be his wife, was, as is
evident by this genealogy, of the house and lineage of David; though a
mean and obscure person, and by trade a carpenter. Mary, which is the
same name with Miriam in Hebrew, was a poor virgin that dwelt at
Nazareth, a city of Galilee; yet also of the family of David, and
belonged to the city of Bethlehem;

of whom was born Jesus who is called Christ, or Messiah; being that
illustrious person, who was spoken of by the Prophets of the Old
Testament under that name, and whom the Jews expected. We may learn from
hence, what a low condition the family of David was in, when the true
Messiah came; according to ancient prophecy, it was like a stump of a
tree, or like to a tree cut down to the root, [Isa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md) and Christ who sprung from it was
like a root out of a dry ground, [Isa
53:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002.md). From the whole of this genealogy
it appears, that Jesus was of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of
Judah, and of the family of David; whereby several ancient prophecies
have their accomplishment, and therefore he ought to be acknowledged as
the true Messiah: and also that he was of the blood royal, and had his
descent from the kings of Judah, and was heir apparent to the throne and
kingdom of his father David. The Talmudic Jews own that Jesus, or Jesu,
as they call him, was put to death because he (s), "was nigh to the
kingdom", or nearly related to it. Yea, even in that malicious book (t)
they have written of his life, they represent him as akin to queen
Helena, who they say, on that account, would have saved his life. And
this was so clear a point, and their forefathers were so thoroughly
convinced of this matter, that they would have took him by force and
made him a king, [Joh 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#015.md) but his
kingdom was to be of another kind, a spiritual, and not a temporal one.

So all the generations from Abraham,.... The Evangelist having traced
the genealogy of Christ from Abraham, which he divides into "three"
parts, because of the threefold state of the Jews, "first" under
Patriarchs, Prophets, and Judges, "next" under Kings, and "then" under
Princes and Priests, gives the sum of each part under its distinct head;
"so all the generations", that is, the degrees of generation, or the
persons generated from Abraham to David, both being included, "are
fourteen generations"; as there were, and no more, and are as follow,
Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, Phares, Esrom, Aram, Amminadab, Naasson,
Salmon, Boaz, Obed, Jesse, David.

And from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen
generations. Here David who closed the first division must be excluded
this, and it must be observed, that the Evangelist does not say as
before, that "all" the generations from David to the captivity were
fourteen, for there were seventeen, three kings being omitted by him at
once; but, the generations he thought fit to mention, in order to reduce
them to a like number as before, and which were sufficient for his
purpose, were fourteen; and may be reckoned in this order, Solomon,
Roboam, Abia, Asa, Josaphat, Joram, Ozias, Joatham, Achaz, Ezekias,
Manasses, Amon, Josias, Jechonias, or Jehoiachin.

And from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen
generations. This must be understood as before; for there might be more
generations in this interval, but these were enough to answer the design
of the Evangelist; and which he thought proper to mention, and may be
numbered in this manner; Jechonias, or Jehoiachin, Salathiel, Zorobabel,
Abiud, Ehakim, Azor, Sadoc, Achim, Eliud, Eleazar, Matthan, Jacob,
Joseph, Christ. This way of reckoning by generations was used by other
nations as well as the Jews (u), particularly the Grecians; so (w)
Pausanias says,

"From Tharypus to Pyrrhus the son of Achilles, , were fifteen
generations of men.''

And Herodotus (x) speaking of those who had reigned in Babylon, says,
among them were two women, one whose name was Semiramis, who reigned
before the other , five generations; many other instances of the like
kind might be given.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 1:18</span></span>

Now the birth of Jesus Christ,.... The Evangelist having finished the
genealogy of Christ, proceeds to give an account of his birth, which
includes both his conception and bringing forth; and which he says

was on this wise, so, "after this manner", and which was very wonderful
and astonishing;

when as, for his mother Mary was found with child, not of man, no, not
of Joseph her husband; Christ had no real father as man, Joseph was
only, as was supposed, his father; but

of the Holy Ghost, according to [Luk
1:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#035.md). "The Holy Ghost shall come upon
thee", &c. and this was done that the human nature of Christ might be
clear of original pollution; that so being the immediate produce of the
Holy Ghost and without sin, it might be fit for union with the Son of
God, and for the office of Mediator he had undertook. When Mary is said
to be

found with child, the meaning is, it appeared by evident signs, it was
observed by Joseph particularly, who might know not only that she was
with child, but with child of the Holy Ghost; by conversation with her,
who might relate to him what passed between the Angel and her, [Luk
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#028.md) though it looks as if as yet he
did not know this, or at least was not fully satisfied about it; since
he had a mind to have put her away, before he was assured of the truth
of it, by the appearance of an angel to him. Now Mary's being with
child, and its being known, were facts, at the time when she was

espoused to Joseph, and thereby the outward credit both of Mary and
Jesus were secured; for had this appeared before the espousals, the Jews
would have fixed a brand of infamy on them both; and both the espousals
and her being found with child, were

before they came together; that is, before they cohabited together as
man and wife, before he brought her home to his own house and bed. The
espousals were before they thus came together. It was usual with the
Jews first to espouse or betroth, and then to marry, or rather
consummate the marriage, by bringing the woman home to her husband's
house, between which there was some space of time. The account and
manner of betrothing is given by Maimonides (y) in the following words.

"Before the giving of the law, if a man met a woman in the street, if he
would, he might take her, and bring her into his house and marry her
between him and herself, and she became his wife; but when the law was
given, the Israelites were commanded, that if a man would take a woman
he should obtain her before witnesses, and after that she should be his
wife, according to [Deu 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#013.md) and
these takings are an affirmative command of the law, and are called
"espousals" or "betrothings" in every place; and a woman who is obtained
in such a way is called "espoused" or "betrothed"; and when a woman is
obtained, and becomes "espoused", although she is not yet "married, nor
has entered into her husband's house", yet she is a man's wife.''

And such a distinction between a married woman and a betrothed virgin,
which was Mary's case, may be observed in [Deu
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#022.md) moreover, her being found or
appearing to be with child, was "before they came together"; which it is
likely, as Dr. Lightfoot (z) observes, was about three months from her
conception, when she was returned from her cousin Elizabeth. It is
probable that as soon as she was espoused to Joseph, or quickly after,
she went and paid her visit to Elizabeth, with whom she stayed about
three months, and then returned home, [Luk
1:56](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#056.md). Upon her return home, she
appears to be with child, with which she had gone three months, a proper
time for the discovery of such a matter, [Gen
38:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#024.md) and which is assigned by the
Jewish doctors for this purpose. In the Misna (a) such a case as this is
put,

"If two men should espouse two women, and at the time of their entrance
into the bride chamber, the one should be taken for the other--they
separate them for three months, because they may prove with child;''

that is, as Bartenora observes upon it,

"they separate them that they may not return to their husbands; and that
if they should be with child, they may distinguish between a legitimate
and an illegitimate offspring; and that the children which they may
bring forth may not be ascribed to the wrong persons.''

Now Mary being gone three months from the time of her espousals to
Joseph, and he and she not being yet come together, it was a clear case,
that the child she was gone three months with, was none of his; hence it
follows,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 1:19</span></span>

Then Joseph her husband,.... To whom she had been betrothed, and who was
her husband, and she his wife according to the Jewish law, [Deu
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#023.md) though not yet come together,

being a just man, observant of the law of God, particularly that which
respected adultery, being wholly good and chaste, like the Patriarch of
the same name; a character just the reverse of that which the Jews give
him, in their scandalous (b) book of the life of Jesus; where, in the
most malicious manner, they represent him as an unchaste and an
unrighteous person:

and not willing to make her a public example, or to deliver her, i.e. to
the civil magistrate, according to Munster's Hebrew edition. The Greek
word signifies to punish by way of example to others, to deter them from
sinning; and with the ancients it (c) denoted the greatest and severest
punishment. Here it means either bringing her before the civil
magistrate, in order to her being punished according to the law in [Deu
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#023.md) which requires the person to be
brought out to the gate of the city and stoned with stones, which was
making a public example indeed; or divorcing her in a very public
manner, and thereby expose her to open shame and disgrace. To prevent
which, he being tender and compassionate, though strictly just and good,

was minded to put her away privily: he deliberately consulted and
determined within himself to dismiss her, or put her away by giving her
a bill of divorce, in a very private manner; which was sometimes done by
putting it into the woman's hand or bosom, see [Deu
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001.md). In Munster's Hebrew Gospel it is
rendered, "it was in his heart to forsake her privately."

But while he thought on these things,.... While he was revolving them in
his mind, considering what was most fit and proper to be done, whether
to dismiss her publicly or privately; while he was consulting within
himself the glory of God, the peace of his own conscience, and the
credit of Mary,

behold the Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream; probably the
same Angel which appeared to Zacharias, and brought him tidings that his
wife should have a son, and who also appeared to Mary, and acquainted
her that she should conceive, and bring forth the Messiah, Whose name
was Gabriel, [Luk 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#011.md). If we will
believe the Jews, this Angel must be Gabriel, since he is the Angel who
they say (d) "is appointed over dreams"; for he appeared to

Joseph in a dream, which is one of the ways and methods in which the
Lord, or an Angel of his, has appeared to the saints formerly, and has
answered them, see [Gen 31:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#011.md) and is
reckoned by the Jews (e) one of the degrees or kinds of prophecy: and so
the Angel here not only encourages Joseph to take to him his wife,

saying Joseph, thou son of David; which is said partly to attest his
being of the house and lineage of David, and partly to raise his
expectations and confirm his faith, that his wife should bring forth the
promised son of David; and chiefly to engage his attention to what he
was about to say,

fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife; do not be afraid either that
thou shalt offend the Lord, or bring any reproach or scandal upon
thyself as if thou didst connive at an adulteress; but as she is thine
espoused wife, solemnly betrothed to thee, take her home to thyself,
live with her as thy wife, and openly avow her as such. To which he is
encouraged by the following reason or argument,

for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost; she has not
been guilty of any criminal conversation with men; this conception of
her's is of the Holy Ghost, and entirely owing to his coming upon her,
and overshadowing her in a wonderful and miraculous manner. I say, the
Angel not only encourages Joseph after this manner, but delivers
something to him by way of prophecy, in the following verse.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 1:21</span></span>

And she shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Jesus. For
though she was with child, it could not be known any otherwise than by
prediction or divine revelation, that she should have a son, whose name
should be called Jesus; a name of the same signification with Joshua and
Hosea, and may be interpreted a "Saviour", [Act
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#023.md) for the word Jesus, comes from
which signifies "to save." And to this agrees the reason of the name
given by the Angel,

for he shall save his people from their sins. The salvation here
ascribed to him, and for which he is every way fit, being God as well as
man, and which he is the sole author of, is to be understood, not of a
temporal, but of a spiritual and everlasting salvation; such as was
prophesied of, [Isa 45:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#017.md) and which
old Jacob had in his view, when he said, "I have waited for thy
salvation, O Lord", [Gen 49:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#018.md) which
by the Jewish (f) Targumist is paraphrased thus:

"Jacob said when he saw Gideon the son of Joash, and Samson the son of
Manoah, that they would rise up to be saviours, not for the salvation of
Gideon do I wait, nor for the salvation of Samson do I look, for their
salvation is "a temporary salvation"; but for thy salvation, O Lord, do
I wait and look, for thy salvation is "an everlasting salvation", or
(according to another copy) but for the salvation of Messiah the son of
David, who shall save the children of Israel, and bring them out of
captivity, for thy salvation my soul waiteth.''

By "his people" whom he is said to save are meant, not all mankind,
though they are his by creation and preservation, yet they are not, nor
will they be all saved by him spiritually and eternally; nor also the
people of the Jews, for though they were his nation, his kinsmen, and so
his own people according to the flesh, yet they were not all saved by
him; many of them died in their sins, and in the disbelief of him as the
Messiah: but by them are meant all the elect of God, whether Jews or
Gentiles, who were given to him by his Father, as a peculiar people, and
who are made willing in the day of his power upon them, to be saved by
him in his own way. And these he saves from "their sins", from all their
sins, original and actual; from secret and open sins; from sins of
heart, lip and life; from sins of omission and commission; from all that
is in sin, and omission upon it; from the guilt, punishment, and damning
power of it, by his sufferings and death; and from the tyrannical
government of it by his Spirit and grace; and will at last save them
from the being of it, though not in this life, yet hereafter, in the
other world, when they shall be without spot or wrinkle, or any such
thing.

Now all this was done,.... These are not the words of the Angel, but of
the Evangelist; observing that Mary's being with child of the Holy
Ghost, and her conception in such an extraordinary manner, whilst a pure
virgin, before she and Joseph came together, who though espoused to him,
was untouched by him, were all brought about in this way, and with such
circumstances,

that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet;
that is, the Prophet Isaiah, and so some copies read. The passage
referred to is in [Isa 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014.md) what is
there spoken was by divine inspiration; it was spoken of the Lord by the
Prophet; the Spirit of the Lord spake by him. Prophets and holy men
formerly, spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost; so that what they
said is to be looked upon as the word of God. Now between the prophecy
of Isaiah referred to, and the fact here recorded by the Evangelist, is
an entire agreement: the prophecy shows the will, counsel, and
determination of God about this matter; the accomplishment of it, the
faithfulness and veracity of God in his word; the prediction declares
that the thing would be, and the thing itself was done, that what was
spoken might be fulfilled; not merely by way of accommodation, or in a
typical and mystical, but in a strict, proper and literal sense.

Behold, a virgin shall be with child,.... These words are rightly
applied to the virgin Mary and her son Jesus, for of no other can they
be understood; not of Ahaz's wife and his son Hezekiah, who was already
born, and must be eleven or twelve years of age when these words were
spoken; nor of any other son of Ahaz by her or any other person since no
other was Lord of Judea; nor of the wife of Isaiah, and any son of his,
who never had any that was king of Judah. The prophecy is introduced
here as in Isaiah with a "behold!" not only to raise and fix the
attention, but to denote that it was something wonderful and
extraordinary which was about to be related; and is therefore called a
"sign", wonder, or miracle; which lay not, as some Jewish writers (g)
affirm, in this, that the person spoken of was unfit for conception at
the time of the prophecy, since no such thing is intimated; or in this,
that it should be a son and not a daughter (h), which is foretold; for
the wonder lies not in the truth of the prediction, but in the
extraordinariness of the thing predicted; much less in this (i), that
the child should eat butter and honey as soon as born; since nothing is
more natural and common with new born infants, than to take in any sort
of liquids which are sweet and pleasant. But the sign or wonder lay in
this, that a "virgin" should "conceive" or "be with child"; for the
Evangelist is to be justified in rendering, by "a virgin"; by the
Septuagint having so rendered it some hundreds of years before him, by
the sense of the word, which comes from and which signifies to "hide" or
"cover"; virgins being such who are unknown to, and not uncovered by
men, and in the Eastern countries were kept recluse from the company and
conversation of men; and by the use of the word in all other places,
[Gen 24:43](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#043.md). The last of these texts
the Jews triumph in, as making for them, and against us, but without any
reason; since it does not appear that the "maid" and the "adulterous
woman" are one and the same person; and if they were, the vitiated woman
might be called a maid or virgin, according to her own account of
herself, or in the esteem of others who knew her not, or as antecedent
to her defilement; see [Deu 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#028.md).
Besides, could this be understood of any young woman married or
unmarried, that had known a man, it would be no wonder, no surprising
thing that she should "conceive" or "be with child", and "bring forth a
son". It is added,

and they shall call his name Emmanuel. The difference between Isaiah and
Matthew is very inconsiderable, it being in the one "thou shalt call",
that is, thou virgin shalt call him by this name; and in the other "they
shall call", that is, Joseph, Mary, and others; for, besides that some
copies read the text in Matthew "thou shalt call", the words both in the
one and the other may be rendered impersonally, "and shall be called";
and the meaning is, not that he should be commonly known and called by
such a name, any more than by any, or all of those mentioned in [Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md), but only that he should be so,
which is a frequent use of the word; or he should be that, and so
accounted by others, which answers to the signification of this name,
which the Evangelist says,

being interpreted is God with us: for it is a compound word of "God" and
"with us", and well agrees with Jesus, who is God in our nature, the
word that was made flesh and dwelt among us. [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md), and is the one and only Mediator
between God and us, [Ti1 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005) (k.md). So
the Septuagint interpret the word in [Isa
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#008.md).

[Matthew 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 1:24</span></span>

Then Joseph being raised from sleep,.... That is, being awaked out of
sleep, "that sleep", into which he either naturally fell, whilst he was
meditating on the affair of Mary's being with child; or rather into
which he was cast by the Lord, on purpose that he might have a
revelation of the will of God to him in a dream; and rising up from his
bed or place where he was, immediately and without any delay,

did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him; firmly believing that it
was a messenger of God that was sent to him, and that this matter was of
the Lord. Wherefore he

took unto him his wife, that is, he publicly married her, whom he had
before espoused, took her to his house, or continued her there, lived
with her as his wife, and owned her to be such, and henceforwards had no
more thoughts of putting her away.

[Matthew 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 1:25</span></span>

And knew her not,.... Or "but he knew her not", answering to the Hebrew
that is, had carnal knowledge of her, or copulation with her, though his
wife. The words are an euphemism, or a modest way of expressing the
conjugal act, and is a very ancient one, see [Gen
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#001.md) and what has been used in nations
and languages. And this conduct of his was necessary,

till she had brought forth her firstborn; that it might be manifest not
only that she conceived, being a virgin, but also that she brought
forth, being a virgin: for both are signified in the prophecy before
related, "a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a son"; which is all
one as if it had been said, a virgin shall conceive, and "a virgin"
shall bring forth a son. The "firstborn" is that which first opens the
womb of its mother, whether any follows after or not, [Exo
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#012.md). Christ is called Mary's
firstborn, because she had none before him, whether she had any after
him or not; for her perpetual virginity seems to be no necessary article
of faith: for when it is said,

Joseph knew her not till she had brought forth, the meaning is certain
that he knew her not before. But whether he afterwards did or not, is
not so manifest, nor is it a matter of any great importance; the word
"until" may be so understood as referring to the time preceding, that
the contrary cannot be affirmed of the time following, [Sa2
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#023.md) and which may be the case here,
and is indeed generally understood so; and it also may be considered as
only expressive of the intermediate time, as in [Mat
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#026.md) as Beza observes. Christ was "her
firstborn" as he was man, and the firstborn of God, or his first and
only begotten, as the Son of God. It is further observed, that she
"called his name Jesus", as was foretold to her, or ordered her by the
Angel, [Luk 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#031.md) and to Joseph, [Mat
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021.md).
