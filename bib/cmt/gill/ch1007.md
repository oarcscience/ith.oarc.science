[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 7:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO 1 CHRONICLES 7

In this chapter are given the genealogies of the tribes of Issachar,
[Ch1 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#001.md) of Benjamin, [Ch1
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#006.md) Naphtali, [Ch1
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#013.md), of Manasseh, [Ch1
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#014.md) of Ephraim, [Ch1
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#020.md) and of Asher, [Ch1
7:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#030.md), even of the chief men of them;
and their numbers are reckoned as in the times of David. The tribes of
Dan and Zebulun are omitted.

[1 Chronicles 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 7:1</span></span>

Now the sons of Issachar were Tola, Puah, Jashub, and Shimron, four. The
same number is given, [Gen 46:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#013.md) with
a small variation of two of their names, there called Phuvah and Job,
from whence so many families sprang, mentioned [Num
26:23](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#023.md), where the names are the same as
here.

[1 Chronicles 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 7:2</span></span>

And the sons of Tola,.... The eldest son of Issachar, whose posterity
are only reckoned by name:

Uzzi, and Rephaiah, and Jeriel, and Jahmai, and Jibsam, and Shemuel,
heads of their father's house, to wit, of Tola; the principal man of his
family:

they were valiant men of might in their generations, famous for their
courage and military exploits, though they sprang from Tola, whose name
signifies "a worm"; and which name Bochart (k) conjectures was given him
by his parents, because he was so weakly that they had no hopes of
raising him; and yet from him sprung such mighty men, and from them such
a numerous race, as follows:

whose number was, in the days of David, two and twenty thousand and six
hundred; besides those of the posterity of Uzzi, after mentioned. This
was at the time Joab took the number of Israel, by the order of David,
[Ch1 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#005.md).

\(k\) Hierozoic. par. 2. l. 4. c. 21. col. 630.

[1 Chronicles 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 7:3</span></span>

And the sons of Uzzi; Izrahiah,.... Including his posterity:

and the sons of Izrahiah; Michael, and Obadiah, and Joel, Ishiah, five;
together with their father, all reckoned the sons of Uzzi:

all of them chief men; in their father's house, heads of families.

[1 Chronicles 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 7:4</span></span>

And with them, by their generations, after the house of their fathers,
were bands of soldiers for war,.... Companies of men of military courage
and skill, who could and did go out to war upon occasion:

six and thirty thousand men; besides the 22,600 Tolaites, [Ch1
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#002.md),

for they had many wives and sons; having many wives, they had many sons;
polygamy was the cause of their large numbers; and that they gave into
for the sake of the multiplication of Abraham's seed, according to the
divine promise.

[1 Chronicles 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 7:5</span></span>

And their brethren among all the families of Issachar,.... As those of
Puah, Jashub, and Shimron, [Ch1 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#001.md).

were men of might; valiant and courageous:

reckoned in all, by their genealogies, fourscore and seven thousand;
that is, including with these those of Tola and Uzzi before given.

[1 Chronicles 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 7:6</span></span>

The sons of Benjamin; Bela, and Becher, and Jediael, three. Benjamin had
ten sons, but three only are mentioned first; the latter of these seems
to be the same with Ashbel, [Gen
46:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#021.md).

[1 Chronicles 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 7:7</span></span>

And the sons of Bela; Ezbon, and Uzzi, and Uzziel, and Jerimoth, and
Iri, five,.... These are thought by some to be the grandsons of Bela,
because of the different names in [Ch1
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#003.md),

heads of the house of their fathers, mighty men of valour; principal men
in their tribe and families, and of great courage:

and were reckoned by their genealogies twenty and two thousand and
thirty and four; who sprung from these men.

[1 Chronicles 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 7:8</span></span>

And the sons of Becher,.... Another son of Benjamin, [Ch1
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#006.md),

Zemira, and Joash, and Eliezer and Elioenai, and Omri, and Jerimoth, and
Abiah, and Anathoth, and Alameth; the two last of these, according to
Kimchi, gave names to two cities in Benjamin, built by them; Anathoth,
the native place of Jeremiah the prophet, and Alameth, the same with
Bahurim, [Sa2 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#005.md).

all these are the sons of Becher; before named.

[1 Chronicles 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch1 7:9</span></span>

And the number of them,.... Of the posterity of the sons of Becher:

after their genealogy by their generations, heads of the house of their
fathers, mighty men of valour; as they increased in succeeding ages, and
at the time of David:

was twenty thousand and two hundred.

[1 Chronicles 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 7:10</span></span>

The sons also of Jediael,.... The third son of Benjamin before
mentioned, [Ch1 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#006.md). Bilhan, including
his posterity, as follows:

and the sons of Bilhan; Jeush, and Benjamin; called so after his great
grandfather:

and Ehud; who was the second judge in Israel, [Jdg
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#015.md).

and Chenaanah, and Zethan, and Tharshish, and Ahishahar; of whom we
nowhere else read.

[1 Chronicles 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch1 7:11</span></span>

All these the sons of Jediael, by the heads of their fathers, mighty men
of valour, were seventeen thousand and two hundred soldiers, fit to go
out for war and battle. Which, with the above sums put together, make of
the tribe of Benjamin, besides what follow, 59,430; who, if numbered by
Joab, the account was not given in by him, [Ch1
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#006.md).

[1 Chronicles 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch1 7:12</span></span>

Shuppim also, and Huppim, the children of Ir,.... The same with Iri,
[Ch1 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#007.md) so that these were not sons
of Benjamin, as they seem to be, if they are the same with Muppim and
Huppim in [Gen 46:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#021.md) but his
great-grandchildren, and are the same with Shupham and Hupham, from whom
families of the tribe of Benjamin sprung, [Num
26:39](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#039.md) the Targum calls them the
inhabitants of a city, but of what is not said, unless Geba should be
meant, [Ch1 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#006.md) and

Hushim, the sons of Aher: either the same with Aharah, the third son of
Benjamin, [Ch1 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#001.md) or Ahiram, [Num
26:38](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#038.md), though some read the words,
"the sons of another"; whom they suppose to be Dan, who otherwise is
omitted; and Hushim is the only son of Dan, [Gen
46:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#023.md), where the same plural word is
used as here; who, they think, is called another, by way of detestation,
that tribe being guilty of gross idolatry; but he rather seems to belong
to Benjamin.

[1 Chronicles 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch1 7:13</span></span>

The sons of Naphtali: Jahziel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shallum,....
Called Shillem, [Gen 46:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#024.md),

the sons of Bilhah; Jacob's concubine; her grandsons; for Naphtali, the
father of them, was her son; from these sprung so many families, after
their names, [Num 26:48](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#048.md).

[1 Chronicles 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch1 7:14</span></span>

The sons of Manasseh; Ashriel, whom she bare,.... The wife of Manasseh,
as distinguished from his concubine in the next clause; though the
Targum reads, in connection with that,"whom his Aramitess (or Syrian)
concubine bare;''

and then adds:

who also bare Machir the father of Gilead; so that Ashriel and Machir
were brethren; from which Ashriel sprung the family of the Ashrielites,
[Num 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#029.md) as from Machir the
Machirites, [Num 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#029.md).

[1 Chronicles 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch1 7:15</span></span>

And Machir took to wife the sister of Huppim and Shuppim, whose sister's
name was Maachah,.... He married into the tribe of Benjamin, a sister of
the persons mentioned, [Ch1 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#012.md) whose
name was Maachah:

and the name of the second was Zelophehad; the second son of Manasseh,
or of his posterity mentioned; for he was not his immediate son; for he
was the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of
Manasseh, [Num 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#001.md).

and Zelophehad had daughters; but no sons, the names of his daughters
are given, [Num 26:33](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#033.md).

[1 Chronicles 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 7:16</span></span>

And Maachah the wife of Machir bare a son, and she called his name
Peresh; and the name of his brother was Sheresh,.... He had both these
sons by her:

and his sons were Ulam and Rakem, that is, either the sons of Peresh or
Sheresh, the nearest, as Kimchi observes.

[1 Chronicles 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 7:17</span></span>

And the sons of Ulam: Bedan,.... See [Sa1
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#011.md).

these were the sons of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh;
that is, were of his posterity, or belonged to his family; for Ulam and
Rakem were sons of a brother of Gilead, [Ch1
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#016.md).

[1 Chronicles 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 7:18</span></span>

And his sister Hammoleketh,.... The sister of Gilead so named; though
the Targum renders it "that reigned"; and so Kimchi, that reigned in
some part of Gilead; and the Vulgate Latin version translates it, "a
queen bare Ishod, and Abiezer, and Mahalah"; Abiezer is the same with
Jeezer, from whom a family sprung of that name, [Num
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#030.md), of which Gideon was, [Jdg
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#011.md).

[1 Chronicles 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch1 7:19</span></span>

And the sons of Shemida,.... Another son of Gilead's sister, unless the
same with Ishod; from him sprung the family of the Shemidaites, [Num
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#030.md).

were, Ahian, and Shechem, and Likhi, and Aniam; from Shechem came the
family of the Shethemites, as from Likhi, if he is the same with Helek,
as probably he may be, was the family of the Helekites, [Num
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#030.md).

[1 Chronicles 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 7:20</span></span>

And the sons of Ephraim,.... A son of Joseph, and father of a tribe of
this name, whose genealogy through five generations follows: Shuthelah,
Bered, Tahath, Eladah, Tahath; the second.

[1 Chronicles 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch1 7:21</span></span>

And Zabad his son,.... Not the son of Tahath the second last mentioned,
but the son of Ephraim, a second son of his:

and Shuthelah; his son, the son of Zabad, called after his uncle's name,
[Ch1 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#020.md).

and Ezer, and Elead; two other sons of Zabad:

whom the men of Gath that were born in that land slew: that is, Zabad
and his three sons; these the men of Gath slew, who were Philistines
that dwelt there, and were originally of Egypt, and were born in that
land, but had removed into Palestine, which had its name from them, of
which Gath was one of its cities; and this bordering upon the land of
Goshen, or being near it, where the Israelites dwelt, they made inroads
upon them, and plundered them:

because they came down to take away their cattle; and the sons, the
grandsons of Ephraim, resisted them, and so were slain: and that the
aggressors were not the Ephraimites, who went out of Egypt before their
time, and fell upon the men of Gath, born in the land of the
Philistines, in order to dispossess them of their land and substance,
and were slain by them, which is the sense of the Targum and other
writers, both Jewish and Christian; but the men of Gath, as is clear
from this circumstance, that they

came down, as men did when they went from Palestine to Egypt, not when
they went from Egypt to Palestine, then they "went up"; which would have
been the phrase used, if this had been an expedition of the Ephraimites
into Palestine; besides, it is not reasonable to think, that the
Ephraimites, addicted to husbandry and cattle, and not used to war,
should engage in such an enterprise; but rather the men of Gath, or the
Philistines, who were a warlike people, and given to spoil and plunder;
this, according to a learned chronologer (l), was seventy four years
after Jacob went down to Egypt, and one hundred and forty years before
the children of Israel came from thence.

\(l\) Nic. Abrami Pharus, l. 9. c. 21. p. 242.

[1 Chronicles 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 7:22</span></span>

And Ephraim their father mourned many days,.... For the loss of his son
and grandchildren for the above fact was done while the Israelites were
in Egypt, and Ephraim the patriarch yet alive; nor is there any need to
suppose another Ephraim, different from him:

and his brethren came to comfort him; some of the heads of the other
tribes of Israel, particularly Manasseh, with some of his family.

[1 Chronicles 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch1 7:23</span></span>

And when he went in to his wife,.... After his grief and sorrow in part
at least had subsided:

she conceived and bare a son; which in some measure made up for the loss
he had sustained:

and he called his name Beriah; which signifies being "in evil" or
calamity, he being born in an evil time:

because it went evil with his house; or evil was in his house, as
Noldius (m), in his family; a great calamity had befallen it.

\(m\) Ebr. Concord. Part. No. 750. p. 165.

[1 Chronicles 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch1 7:24</span></span>

And his daughter was Sherah,.... That is, the daughter of Beriah; not an
immediate daughter, but a descendant of his, otherwise she could not
have reached the times of Joshua, as she did by what follows:

who built Bethhoron the nether, and the upper; which were cities on the
border of the tribe of Ephraim; which the Israelites having taken from
the Canaanites, and destroyed, she rebuilt, see [Jos
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#003.md).

and Uzzensherah; which was called after her own name, and to distinguish
it from another place called Uzzen; though of neither of them do we read
elsewhere.

[1 Chronicles 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch1 7:25</span></span>

And Rephah was his son,.... The son of Beriah, whose genealogy from him
is traced down to Joshua in this and the two following verses, and
stands thus: after Rephah, Resheph, Telah, Tahan, Laadan, Ammihud,
Elishama, who was prince of the tribe of Ephraim in the wilderness, [Num
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#010.md), then Non or Nun, whose son was
Jehoshua or Joshua.

[1 Chronicles 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">ch1 7:28</span></span>

And their possessions and habitations,.... That is, of the sons of
Ephraim, when come into the land of Canaan:

were Bethel, and the towns thereof; the villages belonging to it, which
was formerly called Luz, and was the border of Ephraim, [Jos
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#007.md).

and eastward Naaran: the same with Naarath, [Jos
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#007.md).

and westward Gezer, with the towns thereof; of which see [Jos
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#003.md),

and Shechem also, and the towns thereof; which was a city of refuge in
Mount Ephraim, [Jos 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#007.md)

unto Gaza, and the towns thereof; not Gaza, a city of the Philistines,
for the tribe of Ephraim did not reach so far; the Targum calls it Aiah;
it may be read Adaza, as in the margin of our Bibles.

[1 Chronicles 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">ch1 7:29</span></span>

And by the borders of the children of Manasseh,.... Of the half tribe of
Manasseh on this side Jordan: near to them the Ephraimites dwelt, even
near to

Bethshean and her towns, Taanach and her towns, Megiddo and her towns,
Dor and her towns; of all which places see [Jos
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011.md),

in these dwelt the children of Joseph the son of Israel; the
Ephraimites, in those mentioned in [Ch1
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#028.md), and the Manassites, in those
that are here mentioned; who were both the children or posterity of
Joseph, the beloved son of Israel.

[1 Chronicles 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">ch1 7:30</span></span>

The son of Asher,.... Which, and his two grandsons born before Jacob
went down to Egypt, are here reckoned as in [Gen
46:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#017.md) only it is here added Malchiel
his second grandson:

who is the father of Birzavith; which Jarchi interprets, prince of a
city of this name, which signifies pure oil; which it might have from
the abundance of olives about it, Asher being a tribe which abounded
with them, see [Deu 33:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#024.md) though some
of the Rabbins take it to be the name of a man, whose daughters, they
say, as Jarchi observes, were very beautiful, having much oil to anoint
with, and were married to kings and priests anointed with oil.

[1 Chronicles 7:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">ch1 7:32</span></span>

And Heber,.... The other grandson of Asher; and son of Beriah:

begat Japhlet, and Shomer, and Hotham, and Shuah their sister; a place
on the borders of Ephraim is called the coast of Japhleti; but whether
from this Japhlet is uncertain.

[1 Chronicles 7:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">ch1 7:33</span></span>

And the sons of Japhlet; Pasach, and Bimhal, and Ashvath; these are the
children of Japhlet. Of whom we read not elsewhere,

[1 Chronicles 7:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">ch1 7:34</span></span>

And the sons of Shamer,.... Or Shomer, the brother of Japhlet, [Ch1
7:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#032.md).

Ahi, and Rohgah, Jehubbah, and Aram; of whom nothing is known but their
names.

[1 Chronicles 7:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">ch1 7:35</span></span>

And the sons of his brother Helem,.... Or Helem his brother, that is,
the brother of Shomer, who, according to Hillerus (n), is Hotham, [Ch1
7:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#032.md).

Zophah, and Imna, and Shelesh, and Aram; nowhere else mentioned.

[1 Chronicles 7:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">ch1 7:36</span></span>

And the sons of Zophah,.... The eldest of the sons of Helem:

Suah, and Harnepher, and Shual, and Beri, and Imrah, Bezer; and Hod, and
Shamma, and Shilshah, and Ithran, and Beera; in all eleven.

[1 Chronicles 7:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">ch1 7:38</span></span>

And the sons of Jether,.... The same with Ithran, the last of Zophah's
sons but one, [Ch1 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#037.md),

Jephunneh, and Pispah, and Ara; not Jephunneh the father of Caleb; he
was not of the tribe of Asher, but of Judah.

[1 Chronicles 7:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">ch1 7:39</span></span>

And the sons of Ulla,.... Who either was the son of Ara, last mentioned,
or another son of Jether:

Arah, and Haniel, and Rezia; here ends the genealogy of Asher; the last
of the tribes; Dan and Zebulun not being reckoned at all.

[1 Chronicles 7:40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">ch1 7:40</span></span>

All these were the children of Asher, heads of their father's house,....
Principal men in their tribe, and respective families:

choice and mighty men of valour; these were some selected from others,
