### [Deuteronomy Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

INTRODUCTION TO DEUTERONOMY 1

The time and place when the subject matter of this book was delivered to
the Israelites are observed by way of preface, [Deu
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md), and it begins with reminding them
of an order to them to depart from Mount Horeb, and pass on to the land
of Canaan, which the Lord had given them, [Deu
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#006.md), and with observing the very great
increase of their number, which made it necessary for Moses to appoint
persons under him to be rulers over them, whom he instructed in the duty
of their office, [Deu 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#009.md), and he goes
on to observe, that when they were come to the mountain of the Amorites,
they were bid to go up and possess the land; but, instead of that, they
desired men might be sent to search the land first, which was granted,
[Deu 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#019.md), and though these men upon
their return brought of the fruits of the land, and a good report of it,
particularly two of them; yet being discouraged by the report of the
rest, they murmured, distrusted, and were afraid to enter, though
encouraged by Moses, [Deu 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#024.md), which
caused the Lord to be angry with them, and upon it threatened them that
they should die in the wilderness, and only two of them should ever see
and enjoy the land, and therefore were bid to turn and take their
journey in the wilderness, [Deu 1:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#034.md),
but being convinced of their evil, they proposed to go up the hill, and
enter the land, which they attempted against the commandment of the
Lord, but being repulsed by the Amorites, they fled with great loss, to
their great grief, and abode in Kadesh many days, [Deu
1:41](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#041.md).

[Deuteronomy 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 1:1</span></span>

These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel,.... Not what are
related in the latter part of the preceding book, but what follow in
this; and which were spoken by him, not to the whole body of the people
gathered together to hear him, which they could not do without a
miracle; but to the heads of the people, the representatives of them,
who were convened to hear what he had to say, in order to communicate it
to the people; unless we can suppose that Moses at different times to
several parties of them delivered the same things, until they had all
heard them:

on this side Jordan; before the passage of the Israelites over it to the
land of Canaan; for Moses never went in thither, and therefore it must
be the tract which the Greeks call Persea, and which with respect to the
Israelites when in the land of Canaan is called "beyond Jordan", for
here now Moses was; and the children of Israel had been here with him a
considerable time in the wilderness, the vast wilderness of Arabia,
which reached hither:

in the plain; the plains of Moab, between Bethjeshimoth and.
Abelshittim, where the Israelites had lain encamped for some time, and
had not as yet removed; see [Num
33:49](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#049.md).

over against the Red sea: the word "sea" is not in the text, nor is
there anything in it which answers to "Red"; it should be rendered
"opposite Suph", which seems to be the name of a place in Moab, not far
from the plains of it, and perhaps is the same with Suphah in [Num
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#014.md) for from the Red sea they were
at a considerable distance:

between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab; these
are names of places which were the boundaries and limits of the plains
of Moab, or lay very near them; for Paran cannot be understood of the
Wilderness of Paran, which was too remote, but a city or town of that
name. Tophel and Laban we read of nowhere else; a learned man (a)
conjectures Tophel is the name of the station where the Israelites
loathed the manna as light bread, because of the insipidness of it,
which he observes this word signifies; but that station was either
Zalmonah, or Punon, or this station must be omitted in the account of
their journeys, and besides was too remote. Jarchi helps this conjecture
a little, who puts Tophel and Laban together, and thinks they signify
their murmuring because of the manna, which was white, as Laban
signifies; but the above writer takes Laban to be a distinct station,
the same with Libnah, [Num 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#020.md), and
Hazeroth to be the station between Mount Sinai and Kadesh, [Num
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#016.md). But both seem to be too remote
from the plains of Moab; and Dizahab he would have to be the same with
Eziongaber, [Num 33:35](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#035.md), which he says
the Arabs now call Dsahab, or Meenah el Dsahab, that is, "the port of
gold"; and certain it is that Dizahab has the signification of gold,
and, is by Hillerus (b) rendered "sufficiency of gold", there being
large quantities of it here; perhaps either through the riches of the
port by trade, or by reason of a mine of gold at it, or near it; so the
Vulgate Latin version renders it, "where there is much gold", and the
Septuagint version "golden mines", Catachrysea; and Jerom (c) makes
mention of a place of this name, and says they are mountains abounding
with gold in the wilderness, eleven miles from Horeb, where Moses is
said to write Deuteronomy; elsewhere (d) he calls it Dysmemoab, i.e. the
west of Moab, near Jordan, opposite Jericho.

[Deuteronomy 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 1:2</span></span>

There are eleven days' journey from Horeb, by the way of Mount Seir, to
Kadeshbarnea. Not that the Israelites came thither in eleven days from
Horeb, for they stayed by the way at Kibrothhattaavah, a whole month at
least, and seven days at Hazeroth; but the sense is, that this was the
computed distance between the two places; it was what was reckoned a man
might walk in eleven days; and if we reckon a day's journey twenty
miles, of which See Gill on [Jon 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#003.md),
the distance must be two hundred and twenty miles. But Dr. Shaw (e)
allows but ten miles for a day's journey, and then it was no more than
one hundred and ten, and indeed a camp cannot be thought to move faster;
but not the day's journey of a camp, but of a man, seems to be intended,
who may very well walk twenty miles a day for eleven days running; but
it seems more strange that another learned traveller (f) should place
Kadeshbarnea at eight hours, or ninety miles distance only from Mount
Sinai. Moses computes not the time that elapsed between those two
places, including their stations, but only the time of travelling; and
yet Jarchi says, though it was eleven days' journey according to common
computation, the Israelites performed it in three days; for he observes
that they set out from Horeb on the twentieth of Ijar, and on the twenty
ninth of Sivan the spies were sent out from Kadeshbarnea; and if you
take from hence the whole month they were at one place, and the seven
days at another, there will be but three days left for them to travel
in. And he adds, that the Shechinah, or divine Majesty, pushed them
forward, to hasten their going into the land; but they corrupting
themselves, he turned them about Mount Seir forty years. It is not easy
to say for what reason these words are expressed, unless it be to show
in how short a time the Israelites might have been in the land of
Canaan, in a few days' journey from Horeb, had it not been for their
murmurings and unbelief, for which they were turned into the wilderness
again, and travelled about for the space of thirty eight years
afterwards. Aben Ezra is of opinion, that the eleven days, for the word
"journey" is not in the text, are to be connected with the preceding
words; and that the sense is, that Moses spake these words in the above
places, in the eleven days they went from Horeb to Kadesh.

[Deuteronomy 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 1:3</span></span>

And it came to pass in the fortieth year,.... That is, of the coming of
the children of Israel out of Egypt:

in the eleventh month; the month Shebet, as the Targum of Jonathan,
which answers to part of January and part of February:

in the first day of the month, that Moses spoke unto the children of
Israel according to all that the Lord had given him in commandment unto
them; repeated to them the several commandments, which the Lord had
delivered to him at different times.

[Deuteronomy 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 1:4</span></span>

After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in
Heshbon,.... Either Moses, speaking of himself in the third person, or
rather the Lord, to whom Moses ascribes the victory; of this king, and
his palace, and the slaughter of him, see [Num
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#024.md),

and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Ashtaroth in Edrei; or near
Edrei; for Edrei was not the name of a country, in which Ashtaroth was,
but of a city at some distance from it, about six miles, as Jerom says
(g); hither Og came from Ashtaroth his palace to fight with Israel, and
where he was slain, see [Num 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#033.md).
Ashtaroth was an ancient city formerly called Ashtaroth Karnaim, and was
the seat of the Rephaim, or giants, from whom Og sprung; see Gill on
[Gen 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#005.md), see also [Deu
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#011). Jerom says (h.md) in his time there
were two castles in Batanea (or Bashan) called by this name, nine miles
distant from one another, between Adara (the same with Edrei) and Abila;
and in another place he says (i) Carnaim Ashtaroth is now a large
village in a corner of Batanea, and is called Carnea, beyond the plains
of Jordan; and it is a tradition that there was the house of Job.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 1:5</span></span>

On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab,.... On that side of Jordan in
which the land of Moab was, and which with respect to the land of Canaan
was beyond Jordan; this the Vulgate Latin version joins to the preceding
verse:

began Moses to declare this law: to explain it, make it clear and
manifest; namely, the whole system and body of laws, which had been
before given him, which he "willed" (k), as some render the word, or
willingly took upon him to repeat and explain unto them, which their
fathers had heard, and had been delivered unto them; but before he
entered upon this, he gave them a short history of events which had
befallen them, from the time of their departure from Horeb unto the
present time, which is contained in this and the two next chapters:

saying; as follows.

[Deuteronomy 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 1:6</span></span>

The Lord our God spoke unto us in Horeb,.... The same with Sinai, as
Aben Ezra observes; while the Israelites lay encamped near this
mountain, the Lord spoke unto them:

saying, ye have dwelt long enough in this mount: or near it; for hither
they came on the first day of the third month from their departure out
of Egypt, and they did not remove from thence until the twentieth day of
the second month in the second year, [Exo
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#001.md) so that they were here a year
wanting ten days; in which space of time the law was given them, the
tabernacle and all things appertaining to it were made by them, rulers
both ecclesiastical and civil were appointed over them, and they were
numbered and marshalled in order under four standards, and so ready to
march; and all this being done, they must stay no longer, but set
forward for the land of Canaan. It is well for persons that they are not
to stay long under the law, and the terrors of it, but are directed to
Mount Zion; [Heb 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#018.md).

[Deuteronomy 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 1:7</span></span>

Turn you and take your journey,.... That is, remove from Horeb, where
they were, and proceed on in their journey, in which they had been
stopped almost a year:

and go to the mount of the Amorites; where they and the Amalekites
dwelt, in the south part of the land of Canaan, and which was the way
the spies were sent, [Num 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#017.md),

and unto all the places nigh thereunto; nigh to the mountain. The Targum
of Jonathan and Jarchi interpret them of Moab, Ammon, Gebal, or Mount
Seir: "in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale"; such was the
country near this mountain, consisting of champaign land, hills, and
valleys:

and in the south; the southern border of the land of Canaan, as what
follows describes the other borders of it:

and by the sea side: the Mediterranean sea, the western border of the
land, which Jarchi out of Siphri explains of Ashkelon, Gaza, and
Caesarea, and so the Targum of Jonathan:

into the land of the Canaanites; which was then possessed by them, the
boundaries of which to the south and west are before given, and next
follow those to the north and east:

and unto Lebanon; which was on the north of the land of Canaan:

unto the great river, the river Euphrates; which was the utmost extent
of the land eastward, and was either promised, as it was to Abraham,
[Gen 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018.md) or enjoyed, as it was by
Solomon, [Kg1 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#021.md).

[Deuteronomy 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 1:8</span></span>

Behold, I have set the land before you,.... Described it to them, and
set its bounds, as well as had given them a grant of it:

go in and possess the land, which the Lord sware unto your fathers,
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and their seed after them:
and which being thus made sure unto them, they had nothing more to do
than to go and take possession of it.

[Deuteronomy 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 1:9</span></span>

And I spake unto you at that time,.... About that time; for it was after
the rock in Horeb was smitten, and before they encamped at Mount Sinai,
that Jethro gave the advice which Moses took, and proceeded on it, as
here related; see [Exo 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#001.md).

saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone; to rule and govern them,
judge and determine matters between them. Jethro suggested this to
Moses, and he took the hint, and was conscious to himself that it was
too much for him, and so declared it to the people, though it is not
before recorded; see [Exo 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#018.md).

[Deuteronomy 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 1:10</span></span>

The Lord your God hath multiplied you,.... Which was the reason why he
could not bear them, or the government of them was too heavy for him,
because they were so numerous, and the cases brought before him to
decide were so many:

and, behold, you are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude;
whereby it appeared that the promise to Abraham was fulfilled, [Gen
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#005.md), they were now 600,000 men fit
for war, besides women and children, and those under age, which must
make the number of them very large.

[Deuteronomy 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 1:11</span></span>

The Lord God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as
ye are,.... This prayer he made, or this blessing he pronounced on them,
to show that he did not envy their increase, nor was any ways uneasy at
it, but rejoiced in it, though he gave it as a reason of his not being
able to govern them alone:

and bless you, as he hath promised you: with all kind of blessings, as
he had often promised their fathers.

[Deuteronomy 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 1:12</span></span>

How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your
strife? His meaning is, that he could not hear and try all their causes,
and determine all their law suits, and decide the strifes and
controversies which arose between them; it was too heavy for him, and
brought too much trouble and incumbrance upon him.

[Deuteronomy 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 1:13</span></span>

Take ye wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes,....
Not only whose persons were well known, but their characters and
qualifications, for their probity and integrity, for their wisdom and
prudence in the management of affairs, for their skill and knowledge in
things divine and human, civil and religious, and for their capacity in
judging and determining matters in difference; see [Exo
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#021.md).

and I will make them rulers over you; the people were allowed to choose
their own officers, whom they were to bring to Moses, and present before
him, to be invested with their office. A like method was taken in the
choice and constitution of deacons in the Christian church, when the
secular affairs of it lay too heavy upon the apostles, [Act
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#003.md).

[Deuteronomy 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 1:14</span></span>

And ye answered me and said,.... As the speech of Moses to the people is
not expressed before, so neither this answer of theirs to him:

the thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do; to look out for
and present persons to him as before described; this they saw was for
their own good and profit, as well as for the ease of Moses, and
therefore readily agreed to it.

[Deuteronomy 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 1:15</span></span>

So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known,.... The
principal persons among them, that were remarkable and well known for
their wisdom and understanding, whom the people presented to him:

and made them heads over you; rulers of them, as follows:

captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over
fifties, and captains over tens; see [Exo
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#021.md).

and officers among your tribes; which Jarchi interprets of such that
bind malefactors and scourge them, according to the decree of the
judges, even the executioners of justice; and so the Jews commonly
understand them to be, though some have thought they were judges also.

[Deuteronomy 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 1:16</span></span>

And I charged your judges at that time,.... When they were appointed and
constituted, even the heads and rulers before spoken of; this charge is
also new, and not recorded before:

saying, hear the causes between your brethren; hear both sides, and all
that each of them have to say; not suffer one to say all he has to say,
and oblige the other to cut his words short, as the Targum of Jonathan
paraphrases it; but give them leave and time to tell their case, and
give the best evidence they can of it:

and judge righteously; impartially, just as the case really appears to
be, and according to the evidence given:

between every man and his brother; between an Israelite and an
Israelite:

and the stranger that is with him; between an Israelite and proselyte,
whether a proselyte of the gate, or of righteousness; the same justice
was to be done to them as to an Israelite.

[Deuteronomy 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 1:17</span></span>

Ye shall not respect persons in judgment,.... Or pass judgment, and give
sentence according to the outward appearances, circumstances, and
relations of men; as whether they be friends or foes, rich or poor, old
or young, men or women, learned or unlearned; truth and justice should
always take place, without any regard to what persons are:

but you shall hear the small as well as the great; persons in low, life,
and in mean circumstances, as well as great and noble personages; or
little causes and of no great moment, as well as those of the utmost
importance; all must be attended to, a cause about a "prutah" or a
farthing, as well as one about a hundred pounds, in which Jarchi
instances, and if that came first it was not to be postponed:

ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; of the frowns and
threatenings of rich men, and of such as are in power and authority; not
be awed or intimidated by them from doing justice; see [Job
31:34](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#034.md),

for the judgment is God's; judges stand in the place of God, are put
into their office by him, and act under him, and for him, and are
accountable to him; and therefore should be careful what judgment they
make, or sentence they pass, lest they bring discredit to him, and
destruction on themselves:

and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will
hear it; which is said for their encouragement, as well as was an
instruction to them not to undertake a cause too difficult for them; see
[Exo 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#022.md).

[Deuteronomy 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 1:18</span></span>

And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.
Delivered to them all the laws, moral, ceremonial, and judicial, which
were then given him at Mount Sinai.

[Deuteronomy 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 1:19</span></span>

And when we departed from Horeb,.... As the Lord commanded them to do,
when they were obedient:

we went through all the great and terrible wilderness; the wilderness of
Paran, called "great", it reaching from Mount Sinai to Kadeshbarnea,
eleven days' journey, as Adrichomius (l) relates; and "terrible", being
so hard and dry as not to be ploughed nor sown, and presented to the
sight something terrible and horrible, even the very image of death; to
which may be added the fiery serpents and scorpions it abounded with,
[Deu 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#015.md),

which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites; that is, in the
way that led to the mountain:

as the Lord our God commanded us; to depart from Horeb, and take a tour
through the wilderness towards the said mountain:

and we came to Kadeshbarnea; having stayed a month by the way at
Kibrothhattaavah, where they lusted after flesh, and seven days at
Hazeroth, where Miriam was shut out of the camp for leprosy during that
time.

[Deuteronomy 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">deu 1:20</span></span>

And I said unto you, you are come unto the mountain of the Amorites,....
Which was inhabited by them, and was one of the seven nations the
Israelites were to destroy, and possess their land, and which lay on the
southern part of the land of Canaan:

which the Lord our God doth give unto us; not the mountain only, but the
whole country of that people, and even all the land of Canaan.

[Deuteronomy 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">deu 1:21</span></span>

Behold, the Lord thy God hath set the land before thee,.... The land of
Canaan, on the borders of which they then were; See Gill on [Deu
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#008.md),

go up; the mountain, by that way of it which was the way the spies went,
and up to which some of the Israelites presumed to go when forbidden,
they not complying with the call of God:

and possess it, as the Lord God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; as
in [Deu 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#008.md),

fear not, neither be discouraged; though the people of the land were
numerous and strong, and their cities large and walled.

[Deuteronomy 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">deu 1:22</span></span>

And ye came near unto me everyone of you,.... Not every individual of
them, but the heads of their tribes, that represented them; this is not
to be understood of the present generation personally, but of their
fathers, who all died in the wilderness, save a very few of them; but
they being the same people and nation, it is so expressed:

and said, we will send men before us; that is, they thought it was
proper and prudent so to do, and came to Moses to consult him about it;
for we are not to suppose that they had determined upon it, whether he
approved of it or not:

and they shall search us out the land: that they might know what sort of
land it was, whether good or bad, fruitful or not, and whether woody or
not: see [Num 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#019.md).

and bring us word again by what way we must go up; or, "concerning the
way (m) in which we must go"; which is the best way of entering it, most
easy and accessible, where the passes are most open and least dangerous:

and into what cities we shall come; which it would be the most proper to
attack and subdue first.

[Deuteronomy 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">deu 1:23</span></span>

And the saying pleased me well,.... Taking it to be a rational and
prudent scheme, not imagining it was the effect of fear and distrust:

and I took twelve men of you out of a tribe; whose names are given in
[Num 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#004.md).

[Deuteronomy 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">deu 1:24</span></span>

And they turned and went up into the mountain,.... As they were ordered
and directed by Moses, [Num 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#017.md).

and came unto the valley of Eshcol; so called from the cluster of grapes
they cut down there, as they returned:

and searched it out; the whole land, and so were capable of giving a
particular account of it.

[Deuteronomy 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">deu 1:25</span></span>

And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands,.... Besides the
cluster of grapes, which was carried between two men on a staff; even
pomegranates and figs, [Num 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#023.md),

and brought it down unto us; who lay encamped at the bottom of the
mountain:

and brought us word again; what sort of a land it was:

and said, it is a good land which the Lord our God doth give us; that
is, Caleb and Joshua, two of the spies, said this, as the Targum of
Jonathan expresses it, and so Jarchi; yea, all of them agreed in this,
and said at first that it was a land flowing with milk and honey, [Num
13:27](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#027.md).

[Deuteronomy 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">deu 1:26</span></span>

Notwithstanding, ye would not go up,.... And possess it, as the Lord had
bid them, and Moses encouraged them to do, as well as Joshua and Caleb,
who were two of the spies sent into it:

but rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God; disregarded
the word of the Lord, and disobeyed his command, and thereby bitterly
provoked him, which rebellion against him, their King and God, might
well do.

[Deuteronomy 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">deu 1:27</span></span>

And ye murmured in your tents,.... Not in a private manner; for though
the murmurs began there, they having wept all night after the report of
the spies; yet it became general and public, and they gathered together
in a body, and openly expressed their murmurs against Moses and Aaron,
[Num 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#001.md),

and said, because the Lord hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the
land of Egypt; a strange expression indeed! when it was such a plain
amazing instance of his love to them, as could not but be seen by them;
being done in such a remarkable and extraordinary manner, by inflicting
judgments on their enemies in a miraculous way, giving them favour in
their eyes, to lend them their clothes and jewels, and bringing them out
with such an high hand, openly and publicly in the sight of them, where
they had been in the most wretched slavery for many years; yet this is
interpreted an hatred of them, and as done with an ill design upon them,
as follows:

to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us; which now,
under the power of their fears and unbelief, they thought would be
quickly their case; see [Deu 4:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#037.md).

[Deuteronomy 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">deu 1:28</span></span>

Whither shall we go up?.... What way can we go up into the land? where
is there any access for us? the mountain we are come to, and directed to
go up, is possessed by the Amorites, a strong and mighty people, who
keep and guard the passes, that there is no entrance:

our brethren have discouraged our hearts; ten of the spies; for Joshua
and Caleb encouraged them with very powerful arguments, which had they
listened to, it would have been well for them:

saying, the people is greater and taller than we; more in number, larger
in bulk of body, and higher in stature:

the cities are great, and walled up to heaven; an hyperbolical
expression; their fears exaggerated the account of the spies; they told
them they were great, large, and populous, walled, and strongly
fortified; which appeared in their frightened imaginations as if their
walls were so high as to reach up to heaven, so that it was impossible
to scale them, or get possession of them:

and, moreover, we have seen the sons of the Anakims there; the giants so
called from Anak, the son of Arba, the father of them; their names are
given, [Num 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#022.md).

[Deuteronomy 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">deu 1:29</span></span>

Then I said unto you, dread not, neither be afraid of them. With such
like words he had exhorted and encouraged them before the spies were
sent, and he still uses the same, or stronger terms, notwithstanding the
report that had been made of the gigantic stature and walled cities of
the Canaanites. This speech of Moses, which is continued in the two
following verses, is not recorded in [Num
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#005.md), it is only there said, that
Moses and Aaron fell on their faces, but no account is given of what was
said by either of them.

[Deuteronomy 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">deu 1:30</span></span>

The Lord your God, which goeth before you,.... In a pillar of cloud by
day, and in a pillar of fire by night:

he shall fight for you; wherefore, though their enemies were greater and
taller than they, yet their God was higher than the highest; and cities
walled up to heaven would signify nothing to him, whose throne is in the
heavens:

according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes: which is
observed to encourage their faith in God; for he that wrought such
wonders in Egypt for them, which their eyes, at least some of them, and
their fathers, however, had seen, what is it he cannot do?

[Deuteronomy 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">deu 1:31</span></span>

And in the wilderness,.... Where he had fed them with manna, brought
water out of rocks for them, protected them from every hurtful creature,
had fought their battles for them, and given them victory over Amalek,
Sihon, and Og:

where thou hast seen how the Lord thy God bare thee as a man doth bear
his son; in his arms, in his bosom, with great care and tenderness:

in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place; supplying
their wants, supporting their persons, subduing their enemies, and
preserving them from everything hurtful to them; and therefore having
God on their side, as appeared by so many instances, of his favour to
them, they had nothing to dread or fear from the Canaanites, though ever
so mighty.

[Deuteronomy 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">deu 1:32</span></span>

Yet in this thing ye did not believe the Lord your God. That they might
go up and possess the land at once, and that he would fight for them,
and subdue their enemies under them; or notwithstanding the favours
bestowed upon them, and because of them, they did not believe in the
Lord their God, and which was a great aggravation of their unbelief, and
was the cause of their not entering into the good land, [Heb
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#019.md).

[Deuteronomy 1:33](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">deu 1:33</span></span>

Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your
tents in,.... For when the cloud was taken up they journeyed, and when
that rested, there they pitched their tents; and hereby they were
directed to places the most convenient for water for them and their
flocks, or for safety from those that might annoy them:

in fire by night, to show you by what way ye should go; which otherwise
they could not have found in dark nights, in which they sometimes
travelled, and in, a wilderness where there were no tracks, no beaten
path, no common way:

and in a cloud by day; to shelter them from the scorching sun, where
there were no trees nor hedges to shade them, only rocky crags and
hills.

[Deuteronomy 1:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">deu 1:34</span></span>

And the Lord heard the voice of your words,.... Of their murmurings
against Moses and Aaron, and of their threatenings to them, Joshua and
Caleb, and of their impious charge of hatred of them to God for bringing
them out of Egypt, and of their rash wishes that they had died there or
in the wilderness, and of their wicked scheme and proposal to make them
a captain, and return to Egypt again:

and was wroth, and sware; by his life, himself; see [Num
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#028.md),

saying; as follows.

[Deuteronomy 1:35](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">deu 1:35</span></span>

Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see the
good land,.... The land of Canaan; not only not one of the spies that
brought the ill report of that land, but of that body of people that
gave credit to it, and murmured upon it:

which I sware to give unto your fathers; Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; see
[Deu 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#008.md).

[Deuteronomy 1:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">deu 1:36</span></span>

Save Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, he shall see it,.... Enter into it,
and enjoy it:

and Joshua also; who was the other spy with him, that brought a good
report of the land; see [Deu 1:38](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#038.md),

and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his
children: not the whole land of Canaan, but that part of it which he
particularly came to and searched; and where the giants were, and he saw
them, and notwithstanding was not intimidated by them, but encouraged
the people to go up and possess it; and the part he came to
particularly, and trod on, was Hebron, [Num
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#022.md) and which the Targum of
Jonathan, Jarchi, and Aben Ezra, interpret of that; and this was what
was given to him and his at the division of the land, [Jos
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#013.md),

because he hath wholly followed the Lord; see [Num
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#024.md).

[Deuteronomy 1:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">deu 1:37</span></span>

Also the Lord was angry with me for your sakes,.... Not at the same
time, though, as some think, at the same place, near thirty eight years
afterwards, they provoking him to speak unadvisedly with his lips; see
[Num 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#010.md),

saying, thou shalt not go in thither: into the land of Canaan; and
though he greatly importuned it, he could not prevail; see [Deu
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#025.md).

[Deuteronomy 1:38](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">deu 1:38</span></span>

But Joshua, the son of Nun, which standeth before thee,.... His servant
and minister, which this phrase is expressive of:

he shall go in thither: into the good land, instead of Moses, and as his
successor, and who was to go before the children of Israel, and
introduce them into it, as a type of Christ, who brings many sons to
glory:

encourage him; with the promise of the divine Presence with him, and of
success in subduing the Canaanites, and settling the people of Israel in
their land; and so we read that Moses did encourage him, [Deu
31:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#007.md).

for he shall cause Israel to inherit it; go before them as their
captain, and lead them into it; fight their battles for them, conquer
their enemies, and divide the land by lot for an inheritance unto them;
so the heavenly inheritance is not by the law of Moses, and the works of
it, but by Joshua, or Jesus, the Saviour, by his achievements,
victories, and conquests.

[Deuteronomy 1:39](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">deu 1:39</span></span>

Moreover, your little ones, which ye said should be a prey,.... To the
Amorites, into whose hands they expected to be delivered, [Deu
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#027.md) see [Num
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#003.md).

and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and
evil; not being at years of understanding, and which is a common
description of children; it is particularly expressed "in that day", for
now they were the very persons Moses was directing his speech unto, and
relating this history, it being thirty eight years ago when this affair
was, so that now they were grown up to years of discretion:

they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall
possess it: the relation of which now might serve greatly to encourage
their faith, as well as it would be a fulfilment of the promise of the
land made unto Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, which was not made of none
effect through the unbelief of the Israelites, whose carcasses fell in
the wilderness, since their posterity was to enjoy it, and did.

[Deuteronomy 1:40](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">deu 1:40</span></span>

But as for you, turn ye,.... From the mountain of the Amorites, the
border of the land of Canaan:

and take your journey into the wilderness, by the way of the Red sea:
see [Num 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#025.md). Jarchi says this
wilderness was by the side of the Red sea, to the south of Mount Seir,
and divided between the Red sea and the mount; so that now they drew to
the side of the sea, and compassed Mount Seir, all the south of it, from
west to east.

[Deuteronomy 1:41](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">deu 1:41</span></span>

Then ye answered, and said unto me,.... Not being willing to go into the
wilderness again, though they wished they had died in it; nor to go the
way of the Red sea, which was their way back again to Egypt, though they
had been for appointing a captain, and returning thither; but now they
repented of what they had said and done:

we have sinned against the Lord; by murmuring against his servants, and
disobeying his commands:

we will go up and fight according to all that the Lord our God hath
commanded us; which is more than they were bid to do; they were only
ordered to go up and possess the land, and it was promised them the Lord
would fight for them:

and when ye had girded on every man his weapon; his sword upon his
thigh; a large number of them, for all of them were not so disposed,
though many were:

ye were ready to go unto the hill; though before backward enough, when
they were bid to do it. De Dieu, from the use of the word (n) in the
Arabic language, renders it, "ye reckoned it easy to go up unto the
hill"; before it was accounted very difficult, by reason the passes were
kept and guarded by the Amorites; but now there was no difficulty, when
they were bid to go another way, but were ready at once to go up, which
comes to the same sense; he further observes, that the word, in another
conjugation in the same language, signifies to make light of, or despise
(o); and so may be rendered, "and ye despised"; that is, rejected and
despised the order given them to go into the wilderness by the way of
the Red sea in the preceding verse, by their attempting to go up the
hill; though the word so taken will bear another sense, agreeable to the
first, that they now made a light matter of it, as if it was nothing,
and there was no difficulty in it to go up the hill, which before was
too hard and heavy for them.

[Deuteronomy 1:42](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">deu 1:42</span></span>

And the Lord said unto me,.... When the people had armed themselves, and
were in motion, or ready to set forward to ascend the hill:

say unto them, go not up, neither fight; neither go up the hill, and if
they did, contrary to this order, and should meet with enemies, not
fight them, but retreat:

for I am not among you: the ark of the covenant, the symbol of his
presence, was then among them, but it did not go with them, it continued
in the camp, [Num 14:44](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#044.md) nor did the
Lord exert his power, or show himself present with them, or to be on
their side, but left them to themselves, and to their enemies:

lest ye be smitten before your enemies; God not being with them to fight
for them, protect and defend them, and give them victory.

[Deuteronomy 1:43](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">deu 1:43</span></span>

So I spake unto you,.... The words, the orders he had received from the
Lord to deliver to them:

and ye would not hear; so as to obey them, and act according to them:

but rebelled against the commandment of the Lord: as before, by not
going up when he would have had them gone, and now by attempting it when
he forbid them:

and went presumptuously up into the hill; that is, of themselves, in
their own strength, disregarding the commandment of God, and what they
were threatened with; this they endeavoured to do, for they were not
able to effect it; the Amorites, perceiving them to make up the hill,
came pouring down upon them in great numbers, and stopped them, and
obliged them to retreat; see [Num
14:45](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#045.md).

[Deuteronomy 1:44](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">deu 1:44</span></span>

And the Amorites which dwelt in the mountain,.... Elsewhere called
Canaanites, being one, and a principal one of the seven nations of
Canaan, and who were joined and assisted in the attack by the
Amalekites, [Num 14:45](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#045.md).

came out against you, and chased you, as bees do; which being disturbed
in their hives come out in great numbers, and with great fury and ardour
(for, though a small creature, it has a great deal of spirit); and
pursue the aggressor, and leave him not till they have stung him, though
thereby they lose their stings, and quickly their lives, at least their
usefulness; so these Amorites, being irritated at the approach of the
Israelites on their borders, came out in great numbers and with great
wrath, and fell upon them and smote them, and pursued them a long way,
as is after expressed, though these in the issue were destroyed
themselves. The Syriac version renders it, "as bees that are smoked": or
irritated by smoke; which is a method that has been used, and was
anciently: to dispossess them of their hives, and get their honey, as
Bochart (p) from various writers has shown, as from Virgil (q), Ovid
(r), and others; and when they are too much smoked become exceeding
angry as Aristotle (s) and Pliny (t) observe; and which same writers
take notice of the strength and force of their stings, as that they will
kill with them the largest animals, even horses have been killed by
them; and, though such small feeble creatures, are not afraid to attack
men and beasts; yea, sometimes people have been obliged to leave their
habitations, and have been driven out of their country by them, of which
Aelianus (u) gives an instance; all which shows the aptness and
propriety of this simile; see [Psa
118:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#012.md) and destroyed you in Seir, even
unto Hormah; pursued them as far as Mount Seir, even to another place on
the borders of Edom, which was called Hormah, either from the
destruction now or afterwards made here; See Gill on [Num
14:45](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#045.md), though some take it not to be
the proper name of a place, but an appellative, and render it, "even
unto destruction"; so the Jerusalem Targum; that is, destroyed them with
an utter destruction.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">deu 1:45</span></span>

And ye returned and wept before the Lord,.... Those that remained when
the Amorites left pursuing them, returned to the camp at Kadesh, where
Moses and the Levites were, and the rest of the people; and here they
wept at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and hence said
to be "before the Lord"; they wept because of the slaughter that had
been made among them, and because of their sin in going contrary to the
will of God, and because they were ordered into the wilderness; and very
probably they cried and prayed unto the Lord, that they might not be
turned back, but that he would go with them, and bring them now into the
promised land:

but the Lord would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you; was
inexorable, and would not repeal the order to go into the wilderness
again, where he had sworn in his wrath their carcasses should fall; the
sentence was irrevocable.

[Deuteronomy 1:46](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">deu 1:46</span></span>

So ye abode in Kadesh many days,.... Yea, some years, as some think:

according to the days that ye abode there; that is, according to Jarchi,
as they did in the rest of the journeys or stations; so that as they
were thirty eight years in all at several places, they were nineteen
years in Kadesh; the same is affirmed in the Jewish chronology (w).
Maimonides says (x) they were eighteen years in one place, and it is
very probable he means this; but Aben Ezra interprets it otherwise, and
takes the sense to be, that they abode as many days here after their
return as they did while the land was searching, which were forty days,
[Num 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#025.md), but without fixing any
determinate time, the meaning may only be, that as they had been many
days here before this disaster, so they continued many days after in the
same place before they marched onward into the wilderness again.
