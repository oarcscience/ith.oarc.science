### [Proverbs Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 15:1</span></span>

A soft answer turneth away wrath,.... Mild words, gentle expressions,
delivered with kindness and tenderness, humility and submission; these
will work upon a man's passions, weaken his resentments, and break and
scatter the storm of wrath raised in his breast, just breaking forth in
a very boisterous and blustering manner; so high winds are sometimes
laid by soft showers. Thus the Ephraimites were pacified by Gideon's
mild answer; and David by Abigail's very submissive and respectful
address, [Jdg 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#001.md);

but grievous words stir up anger; such as are rough and menacing,
scornful and sneering, reproachful and reviling, proud, haughty, and
overbearing; like those of Jephthah to the Ephraimites; and of the
Ephraimites to the Gileadites; and of Nabal to David's servants,
concerning him; and of Rehoboam, who answered the people roughly: in all
which instances anger was stirred up, and either were or like to have
been attended with bad consequences, [Jdg
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#001.md). Or a "word" causing, or rather
expressing, "grief" (r); upbraiding others with being the cause of grief
to them.

[Proverbs 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 15:2</span></span>

The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright,.... As the heart of a
wise and good man is filled with useful knowledge, civil, moral,
spiritual, and evangelical; so he takes care to communicate it, at
proper times and seasons, in proper places, and to proper persons;
adapting it to their case and circumstances, so as it may be for their
comfort, edification, and instruction, and minister grace unto them;
which is using knowledge "well", as the word (s) signifies: such an use
of it recommends it, and makes it appear beautiful and lovely, decorates
and adorns it. Thus every good man, out of the good treasure of
knowledge in his heart, brings forth his good things seasonably, to the
use of edifying; in like manner, ministers of the word, scribes well
instructed in the things of God, bring forth both new and old, to the
profit of those to whom they minister; so Christ, as man and Mediator,
had the tongue of the learned, to speak a word in season to weary souls;

but the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness; their knowledge, as they
take it to be, but it is no other than folly; this they throw out in
great plenty, in a hurry, without fear or wit; they "babble" it out, as
the word (t) signifies, as water out of a fountain; their hearts are
full of it, and their mouths proclaim it, [Pro
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#023.md).

[Proverbs 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 15:3</span></span>

The eyes of the Lord are in every place,.... Which are expressive of his
omniscience, of the full, clear, distinct, and perfect knowledge, which
he has of all creatures and things; so that nothing is hid from him, but
all open and manifest to him; as they are to Christ the essential Word,
[Heb 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#013.md); and also of the providence
of God with respect to all persons in general, and to his own people in
particular; and as he is infinite and immense, omnipresent and in all
places of the world, so his omniscience and providence reach everywhere,
to places most distant and secret, and to persons in them, who cannot be
concealed from him, since he fills heaven and earth, [Jer
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#023.md);

beholding the evil and the good; meaning not evil things and good
things, though that is true; the one he beholds with dislike, the other
with pleasure; but evil men and good men: he beholds them as from a
watch tower, as the word (u) signifies, from above, from heaven, where
he is; see [Psa 33:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#013.md). By "evil" men
may be meant both profane sinners and carnal professors; such as are
more openly wicked, and declare their sin, as Sodom, or more secretly
so; he sees into all the wickedness there is in their hearts, all their
secret devices against his people; the works done by them in the dark,
as well as their more open ones; and his eyes are upon all of them, to
bring them into judgment at the last day: his eyes are particularly on
the proud, to abase them; such as are under a disguise of religion, and
have a form of godliness, he has his eyes upon; he sees through all
their disguises; he knows on what foot they took up their profession; he
discerns between that and true grace; he sees how they retain their
lusts with their profession; observes the springs and progress of their
apostasy; and will fix his eyes on the man without a righteousness, not
having on the wedding garment, and order him into outer darkness. He
also beholds "good" men; he sees all their bad things, their sins, and
corrects them for them; their good things, their graces, and the
exercise of them; their good works, the fruits of his own grace; their
weaknesses, and supports and strengthens them; their wants, and supplies
them; their persons, and never withdraws his eyes from them: these are
on them continually, to protect and defend them; nor will he leave them
till he has brought them safe to heaven; see [Ch1
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#009.md).

[Proverbs 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 15:4</span></span>

A wholesome tongue is a tree of life,.... A tongue that delivers out
salutary instructions, wholesome advice and counsel; a "healing tongue"
(w), as it may be rendered, which pacifies contending parties, and heals
the divisions between them; to have the benefit of such a man's company
and conversation is like being in paradise. Such is the tongue of a
Gospel minister, which delivers out the wholesome words of our Lord
Jesus Christ; sound speech and doctrines, which cannot be condemned;
healing truths to wounded consciences, such as peace, pardon,
righteousness, and atonement by the blood of Christ. These are the means
of quickening dead sinners, reviving and comforting distressed ones, and
show the way of eternal life unto them;

but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit; impure, unchaste,
unsavoury, and corrupt language, does mischief to the spirits of men;
evil communications corrupt the heart and manners, defile the soul and
the conversation; these and unsound doctrines eat as a canker; and as
they make the heart of God's people sad, whom he would not have made
sad; so they bring distress and despair into the spirits of others, and
make sad wounds and breaches there, which are never healed, and that
both in the spirits of speakers and hearers; for damnable heresies bring
swift destruction on the propagators of them, and them that receive
them.

[Proverbs 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 15:5</span></span>

A fool despiseth his father's instruction,.... They are fools that
despise any instruction that is wise, good, and profitable; and
especially a father's instruction, whose love, tender affection, and
care, will not suffer him, knowingly, to give any but what is good and
wholesome: wherefore to despise it is not only a contempt of his
authority, but a slight of his love; which are both very aggravating,
and sufficiently demonstrate his folly; and of which he may be himself
convinced when it is too late, and say, "how have I hated instruction
and despised reproof?" [Pro 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#012.md). He
is a fool that despises the instruction of anyone superior to him in
years and experience; of ministers of the word; and especially of our
Father which is in heaven, declared in the sacred Scriptures, which are
written for instruction in righteousness;

but he that regardeth reproof is prudent; the reproof of a father, whose
corrections are to be submitted to, and received with reverence; and
especially of the Father of spirits, whose rebukes are in love, and for
profit and advantage; yea, he is a wise man that regards the reproof of
the word of God, and the ministers of it; and indeed of any Christian,
whether his superior, equal, or inferior, as David did, [Psa
141:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#005.md).

[Proverbs 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 15:6</span></span>

In the house of the righteous is much treasure,.... God sometimes
blesses the righteous with great riches, as he did Abraham; or, however,
if they have but little, it is better than the riches of many wicked;
because they have what they have with a blessing, and they are content
with it: and they have abundance of spiritual treasure; they have God
for their portion; Christ, and all good things along with him; the rich
graces of the Spirit; a rich experience of the grace of God; and all
this is but a pledge and earnest of what they shall possess hereafter;

but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble; they have much trouble in
getting their riches, by which they pierce themselves through with many
sorrows; they have much trouble in keeping them; cannot rest nor sleep
because of their abundance, lest it should be taken away from them; and
they have much trouble in parting with them, when they are, by one
providence or another, stripped of them; and, besides, they have them
with a curse, and are ever attended with uneasiness, on one account or
another.

[Proverbs 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 15:7</span></span>

The lips of the wise disperse knowledge,.... Scatter it about for the
benefit of others; they are communicative and diffusive of it unto
others, that fruit may abound to their account: so the first ministers
of the Gospel diffused the savour of the knowledge of Christ and his
Gospel in every place; their words went into all the earth, and their
sound to the end of the world; and so every Gospel minister will speak
according to the oracles of God, and according to the abilities and
measure of the gift which he has received; and to the utmost of his
power feeds souls with knowledge and understanding;

but the heart of the foolish doth not so; does not disperse knowledge,
for he has no solid substantial knowledge in him: or, "the heart of the
foolish is not right" (x); it is full of folly and wickedness: or "the
heart of the foolish does not disperse that which is right" (y); true
and right things, and the knowledge of them; but, on the contrary, as in
[Pro 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#002.md), "pours out foolishness".

\(x\) "non erit rectum", Pagninus, Baynus; "non est rectum", Piscator,
Mercerus. (y) "Spargit quod abest a recto", Junius & Tremellius, Amama;

[Proverbs 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 15:8</span></span>

The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord,.... Even
those sacrifices which were of divine appointment under the former
dispensation, when offered by wicked men, without faith in Christ,
without any sense of sin, repentance for it, and reformation from it;
when these were used as a cloak for sin, under which they sheltered and
satisfied themselves, and went on in sin; when they brought them "with a
wicked mind", as in [Pro 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#027.md); when
either what they brought were not according to the law, the lame and the
blind; or were not their own, but robbery for burnt sacrifice; or
supposing that these would atone for their sins of themselves; when
either of these, or all this, was the case, it was an abomination to the
Lord; see [Isa 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#011.md). Wherefore much
more must Pagan sacrifices be an abomination to him; which were not of
his appointing, and were offered to devils, and not to him; and which
were many of them very inhuman and shocking; as giving a man's firstborn
for his transgression, and the fruit of his body for the sin of his
soul: and so likewise Papal sacrifices, the sacrifice of the mass; the
bloodless sacrifice, the offering up again of the body and blood of
Christ, they pretend to; which, as it is wicked and blasphemous, is an
abomination to the Lord, and perhaps is chiefly intended. Sacrifice may
stand for every religious duty performed by a wicked man, being
hypocritically done, and with no good view; and all their good works,
which seem to be so; and are either not according to the word and will
of God, being never commanded by him, of which sort are many among the
Papists; or they are not done in faith, and so sin, and do not spring
from love to God; but are done with a heart full of enmity to him, and
are not directed to his glory: in short, whatever is done by them, let
it have ever such an appearance of devotion and goodness; yet if it is
placed in the room of Christ, and used to the setting aside of his
righteousness, satisfaction, and sacrifice, it is an abomination to the
Lord;

but the prayer of the upright is his delight: the prayer of such, whose
hearts are right with God; who have right spirits renewed in them; are
Israelites indeed; have the truth of grace and root of the matter in
them; are honest, sincere, and upright in heart: the prayer of such,
which is an inwrought one, wrought in his heart by the Spirit of God,
and so comes from God, and is his own breathing in him, must be well
pleasing to him; that which is fervent, earnest, and importunate, which
cometh not out of feigned lips, but from the heart, and is put up with a
true heart, in the sincerity of it; the prayer of faith, the cry of the
humble; the prayer which is addressed to God as a Father, in the name of
Christ the Mediator, which comes perfumed with the incense of his
mediation, introduced with the celebration of the divine perfections,
contains humble confessions of sin and unworthiness, ascribes all
blessings to the grace of God, and expresses thankfulness for favours
received, is very acceptable and delightful to God; though it is the
prayer of a poor, mean, despicable creature in his own eyes, and in the
eyes of others, [Psa 102:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#017.md). This
stands opposed to the pompous rites and ceremonies, the gaudy worship
and costly sacrifices, of wicked men; such as used by the Papists.

[Proverbs 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 15:9</span></span>

The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the Lord,.... The way his
heart devises, which he chooses and delights in, in which he walks; nor
will he leave it, nor can he be diverted from it, but by the powerful
grace of God. This is a way not good, but evil, and so an abomination to
the Lord; and the whole tenor and course of his life, which is meant by
his way being evil: hence his sacrifices, and all his external duties of
religion performed by him, are abominable to the Lord; for, while he
continues in a course of sin, all his religious exercises will be of no
avail, cannot be pleasing and acceptable to God;

but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness; either after a
justifying righteousness; not the righteousness of the law, which the
carnal Jews followed after, but did not attain unto; nor is
righteousness to be had by the works of the law, nor any justification
by it, nor can a man be acceptable to God on account of it; but the
righteousness of Christ, which he has wrought out, and is revealed in
the Gospel: to follow after this supposes a want of one; a sense of that
want; a view of the glory, fulness, suitableness, and excellency of
Christ's righteousness; an eager desire after it, sometimes expressed by
hungering and thirsting after it, as here by a pursuit of it; which
means no other than an earnest and importunate request to be found in
it: and such, as they shall be satisfied or filled with it, so they are
loved by the Lord, and are acceptable to him through the righteousness
they are seeking after: or else it may be understood of following after
true holiness of heart and life, without which there is no seeing the
Lord; and though perfection in it is not attainable in this live, yet a
gracious soul presses after it, which is well pleasing in the sight of
God.

[Proverbs 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 15:10</span></span>

Correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way,.... The right
way, the way of God; the way of his commandments: the Vulgate Latin
version is, "the way of life"; the same with the way of righteousness,
which apostates, having known and walked in, turn aside from; see [Pe2
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#015.md). And such deserve severe
correction, the chastisement of a cruel one, correction in wrath and hot
displeasure; which, when they have, is very disagreeable to them; they
behave under it like a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke, and yet they
are but dealt righteously with. Or the words may be rendered, "he has
had bad discipline" or "instruction (z) that forsakes the way"; due care
has not been taken of him; he has not been properly instructed, nor
seasonably corrected; had he, he would not easily have departed from the
way in which he should go; see [Pro
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#006.md). The Targum is,

"the discipline of an evil man causes his way to err;''

or him to err from his way;

and he that hateth reproof shall die; that hates the reproof of parents,
masters, and ministers of the word; as he may be said to do that
neglects and rejects it, and does not act agreeably to it: and such a
man, dying in impenitence and without faith in Christ, dies in his sins;
and sometimes shamefully, or a shameful death, as the Septuagint and
Arabic versions, or an untimely one; as well as dies the second death,
an eternal one.

[Proverbs 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 15:11</span></span>

Hell and destruction are before the Lord,.... Or "the grave" (a), which
is the pit of destruction; where bodies being put, putrefy, and are
destroyed by worms: this is known by the Lord, even the grave of
everyone from the beginning; the graves of Adam, Abel, Abraham; he knows
where their dust lies, and will raise it up again at the last day.
Hades, or the invisible state of the departed, as the Septuagint has it,
is manifest before him; he knows where departed spirits are; what their
condition and employment be; and so the place and state of the damned,
known by the name of "hell"; and may be called "destruction", where soul
and body are destroyed by the Lord with an everlasting destruction; and
is the destruction which the broad way of sin leads unto. Now though we
know not where this place is, who are there, and what the torments
endured in it; yet all is before the Lord, and known to him: "tophet" is
ordained of old; everlasting fire is prepared by the Lord for devils and
wicked men; see [Job 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#006.md);

how much more then the hearts of the children of men? which, though
desperately wicked, are known by him; who is the searcher of the hearts
and the trier of the reins of the children of men: he to whom hell is
naked, and can look into that outer darkness, the blackness of darkness,
can look into a man's heart, a second hell, in which all manner of
wickedness is, and observe it all; he needs no testimony of man; he
knows what is in man, all his secret thoughts, wicked purposes, designs,
and devices; see [Jer 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#009.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 15:12</span></span>

A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him,.... He that makes a jest of
religion; scoffs at godliness and godly men; treats the Gospel and the
ministers of it with contempt; makes a mock at good men, and all that is
good; a pestilent fellow, as the Vulgate Latin version: such an one not
only does not love, for more is intended than is expressed; but hates
him that reproves him, and especially if publicly, [Amo
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#010.md); he thinks ill of him; bears him
a grudge, and abhors him; and speaks evil of him, and reproaches him;
and does all he can to the injury of his person and name; hence the
advice of the wise man, [Pro 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#007.md). Some
render it, he "loves not reproving himself", or "to reprove himself"
(b); he does not care to look into his own heart and ways, or to call
himself to an account for what he does; nor to check himself in the
pursuit of sin, nor argue with and reprove himself for it;

neither will he go unto the wise; to the private houses of wise and good
men; nor to the house of wisdom, or place of public instruction, where
wise dispensers of the word give good advice and counsel; scorners do
not choose to go to either, lest they should be reproved for their evil
ways, and be advised leave them; neither of which is agreeable to them;
see [Joh 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#020.md).

[Proverbs 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 15:13</span></span>

A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance,.... Or, a "joyful heart"
(c); that is joyful in the God of its salvation; that rejoices in Christ
Jesus; is filled with joy and peace through believing in him, in his
person, blood, righteousness, and sacrifice; that has a comfortable view
of his justification by his righteousness, of peace and pardon by his
blood, of the atonement of his sins by his sacrifice; to whom he has
said, "be of good cheer, thy sins are forgiven thee", [Mat
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#002.md); who has peace in him, though
tribulation in the world: as such a man's heart must be made glad, this
will make his countenance cheerful, or cause him to lift up his head
with joy; as it is in natural things, so it is in spiritual ones;

but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken; a man is dejected, his
spirits sink, and it is seen in his countenance: there is a great
sympathy between the body and mind, the one is much affected by the
other; when the heart is full of sorrow, the animal spirits are low, the
nerves are loosened, the whole frame, of nature is enfeebled, and the
body emaciated; this is often the case through outward troubles (d):
physicians say (e) that grief weakens the strength, and destroys the
spirits, more than labour does. "The sorrow of the world worketh death",
[Co2 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#010.md); and sometimes, through
spiritual troubles, a sense of sin and guilt of it, a legal sorrow,
which produces a legal contrition of spirit; and such "a wounded spirit
who can bear?" [Pro 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#014.md). This is the
effect of a mere work of the law upon the conscience; and stands opposed
to the spiritual joy, and the effects of it, the Gospel brings.

[Proverbs 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 15:14</span></span>

The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge,.... He that
has in his heart an understanding of divine and spiritual things, of the
Gospel and of the truths of it, will seek earnestly and diligently in
the use of proper means after more knowledge; as he will desire to know
more of Christ, his person, offices, and grace, he will follow on to
know him, and not be content with the present degree of knowledge he has
attained unto; he will hear and read the word, and pray and meditate, in
order to come to a more perfect knowledge of the son of God, and of
those things which relate to his spiritual peace and eternal welfare;

but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness; on foolish talking and
jesting; on foolish and unlearned questions; on foolish and false
doctrines; on foolish and hurtful lusts; on wind and ashes, a deceived
heart having turned them aside: they take pleasure and satisfaction in
those things; feed their fancy with them and feast upon them, which
shows what fools they are; and such all unregenerate men be.

[Proverbs 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 15:15</span></span>

All the days of the afflicted are evil,.... And some are afflicted all
their days, from their youth up; so that not only the days of old age
are evil days, in which they have no pleasure, but even the days of
their youth; all their days, as Jacob says, "few and evil have the days
of the years of my life been", [Gen
47:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#009.md); because they had been filled up
with affliction and trouble of one sort or another. Or, "all the days of
the poor" (f); either in purse, who want many of the good things of
life; or in knowledge, as Gersom and Aben Ezra observe;

but he that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast; a heart that has
"the kingdom of God" in it, which lies "not in meat and drink, but in
righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost", [Rom
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#017.md), which has the love of God shed
abroad in it by the Spirit, where Christ dwells by faith; and that lives
by faith on him, and on the provisions of his grace; all this is a
constant continual feast to a gracious soul, made joyful hereby.

[Proverbs 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 15:16</span></span>

Better is little with the fear of the Lord than great treasure and
trouble therewith. Not that a "little" is better than "much" of that
which is good, as the things of this world are in themselves; poverty is
not better than riches, simply considered; but as these are attended
with different circumstances: if a man has but little of worldly
substance, yet if he has "the fear of God" in his heart, and before his
eyes; that fear which has God for its author and for its object, and
which is itself a treasure; and may be here put for all grace, for the
riches of grace saints are partakers of; such a man's little is better
than another man's abundance without the fear of the Lord, as the
Septuagint and Arabic versions render it: for such a man, though he has
but little, which is the common portion of good men, yet he does not
lack; be has enough, and is content; what he has he has with a blessing,
and he enjoys it, and God in it, and has communion with him; and has
also other bread to eat, the world knows nothing of: and particularly
having the fear of God, the eve of God is upon him with pleasure; his
heart is towards him, and sympathizes with him in all his troubles; his
hand communicates unto him both temporal and spiritual meat, which is
given to them that fear the Lord; his angels encamp about him, his power
protects him; his secrets are with him, and inconceivable and
inexpressible goodness is laid up for him: wherefore he is better off
with his little, having the fear of God, than another with his great
abundance and affluence, being destitute of it: and besides, having a
great deal of "trouble" along with his treasure; trouble in amassing and
getting it together; trouble in keeping it from being lost, or taken
away by thieves and, robbers, for fear of which he cannot sleep; trouble
through an insatiable desire of having more; he has no rest nor peace
because he has not so much as he would have, or others have. Besides, he
has what he has with curse; God sends upon him cursing, vexation, and
rebuke, in all he sets his hand to, [Deu
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#002.md); where the same word is used as
here: and he has it also with the cry of the poor; so some render the
word, "a noise" or "tumult" (g); and interpret it of the cries and tears
of those that are oppressed and injured; so Jarchi and Gersom; or, "with
terror" (h), as some render it; with the terrors of a guilty conscience,
with the fear of hell and everlasting damnation. Better have a little
with a good conscience, than ever so much attended with such
circumstances; it is not any man's little, but the good man's little,
that is preferable to the wicked man's much; see [Psa
37:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#016.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 15:17</span></span>

Better is a dinner of herbs, where love is,.... What Plautus (i) calls
"asperam et terrestrem caenam", "a harsh and earthly supper", made of
what grows out of the earth; which is got without much cost or care, and
dressed with little trouble; a traveller's dinner, as the word (k)
signifies, and a poor one too to travel upon, such as is easily
obtained, and presently cooked, and comes cheap. Now, where there are
love and good nature in the host that prepares this dinner; or in a
family that partakes of such an one, having no better; or among guests
invited, who eat friendly together; or in the person that invites them,
who receives them cheerfully, and heartily bids them welcome: such a
dinner, with such circumstances, is better

than a stalled ox, and hatred therewith; than an ox kept up in the stall
for fattening; or than a fatted one, which with the ancients was the
principal in a grand entertainment; hence the allusion in [Mat
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#004.md). In the times of Homer, an ox was
in high esteem at their festivals; at the feasts made by his heroes,
Agamemnon, Menelaus, and Ajax, an ox was a principal part of them, if
not the whole; the back of a fat ox, or a sirloin of beef, was a
favourite dish (l). Indeed in some ages, both among Greeks and Romans,
an ox was abstained from, through a superstitious regard to it, because
so useful a creature in ploughing of the land; and it was carried so far
as to suppose it to be as sinful to slay an ox as to kill a man (m): and
Aratus (n) represents it as not done, neither in the golden nor silver
age, but that in the brasen age men first began to kill and eat oxen;
but this is to be confuted by the laws of God, [Gen
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#003.md); and by the examples of Abraham
and others. Now if there is hatred, either in the host, or in the guests
among themselves, or in a family, it must stir up strifes and
contentions, and render all enjoyments unpleasant and uncomfortable; see
[Pro 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#001.md); but where the love of God
is, which is better than life, and the richest enjoyments of it; which
sweetens every mercy, and cannot be purchased with money; and secures
the best of blessings, the riches of grace and glory, and itself can
never be lost; where this is, the meanest diet is preferable to the
richest and most costly banquets of wicked men; who are hated and
abhorred by the Lord, for their oppression and injustice, their luxury,
or their covetousness; for poor men may be loved of God, and the rich be
abhorred by him, [Psa 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#004.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 15:18</span></span>

A wrathful man stirreth up strife,.... A man of a wrathful disposition,
of a furious spirit, of an angry temper; that is under the power and
dominion of such a passion, and indulges it, and takes all opportunities
to gratify it; he stirs up strife and contention where there was none,
or where it was laid; as a man stirs up coals of fire and raises a
flame; see [Pro 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#021.md). He stirs up
strife in families, sets one relation against another, and the house in
an uproar; he stirs up contentions in neighbourhoods, and sets one
friend and neighbour against another, whence proceed quarrels and
lawsuits: he stirs up strife in churches, breaks brotherly love, and
causes animosities and divisions; he stirs up strife in kingdoms and
states, whence come wars and fightings, confusion, and every evil work;

but he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife: a man of a quiet and
peaceable disposition, possessed of the true grace of charity; who is
not easily provoked, longsuffering, bears and endures all things; he
allays the heat of anger; he quenches the coals of contention; he calms
the storm and makes it quiet, as the word (o) signifies; he

"mitigates strifes raised,''

as the Vulgate Latin version renders it; he composes differences,
reconciles the parties at variance, and makes all hush and still; and so
prevents the ill consequences of contention and strife.

The way of the slothful man is as an hedge of thorns,.... Or, "strewed
with thorns", as the Septuagint and Arabic versions; the Targum is,

"the ways of the slothful are briers and thorns.''

Either really being made so by his own conduct; who, by his
slothfulness, has implicated and entangled himself in such difficulties,
that he cannot extricate himself; his way is not passable, at least not
very easily; it is as it were hedged up with thorns; see [Hos
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#006.md); or in his own apprehensions; who
raises such difficulties about doing business, which to him seem
insurmountable; at least which discourage him from attempting it, it
being like breaking through thorns and briers; hence he will not plough
because of the cold, nor go abroad because there is a lion in the
streets, [Pro 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#004.md); or the way of his
duty, especially of virtue and religion, is as troublesome and
disagreeable to him as breaking through a thorn hedge, or treading upon
briers and thorns; to attend the duties of public worship, prayer, and
hearing the word, is very irksome to him; to be present at family
worship, at prayer, and hearing the Scriptures or religious discourses
read, is like sitting upon thorns unto him. This, as Aben Ezra observes,
is to be understood of a wicked man, as the opposition in the next
clause shows;

but the way of the righteous is made plain: it is a castup way, as the
word (p) signifies; a causeway, a highway, and a plain one, in which a
truly righteous and good man finds no difficulty; yea, it is so plain,
that men, though fools in other respects, shall not err therein, [Isa
35:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#008.md); nor is it grievous and
troublesome, but, on the contrary, very delightful, as the ways of
Christ and wisdom are; his commandments are not grievous, his yoke is
easy, and his paths pleasant; and the righteous man walks at liberty and
with pleasure in them; and without offence or stumbling, as the Vulgate
Latin version renders it.

A wise son maketh a glad father,.... See Gill on [Pro
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001.md);

but a foolish man despiseth his mother; that bore him and brought him
up, and perhaps was too indulgent to him; which aggravates his sin and
her sorrow; See Gill on [Pro 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001.md); or
causes her to be despised by others, as Jarchi interprets it; such a
man's sin, which is great folly, and shows him to be a foolish man, is
highly resented by the Lord, and will be severely punished; see [Pro
30:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#017.md). The Targum is,

"a foolish son despises his mother;''

and so the Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic versions, which makes the
antithesis more clear; and the Hebrew text designs one grown up to man's
estate.

[Proverbs 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 15:21</span></span>

Folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom,.... Or "that wants a
heart" (q), a wise and understanding one; by "folly" is meant sin, for
all sin is folly; and that is very pleasing and joyous to a wicked he
chooses it and delights in it; instead of being ashamed of it, and sorry
for it, he glories in it, and makes his boast of it; and not only takes
pleasure in committing it himself, but also in those that do it; see
[Pro 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#023.md);

but a man of understanding walketh uprightly; he who has his
understanding enlightened by the Spirit of God; who has an understanding
given him by the Son of God; who has a spiritual and experimental
understanding of the Gospel, and the truths of it: he walks according to
the rule of the divine word; he walks as he has Christ for an example,
and by faith on him; and after the spirit, and not after the flesh: or
"directs himself in walking" (r), his goings, as the Vulgate Latin
version, according to the above rule, example, and guidance, by the
assistance of the spirit and grace of God; otherwise it is not in man
that walketh of himself to direct his steps, [Jer

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 15:22</span></span>

Without counsel purposes are disappointed,.... If a man determines and
resolves upon a matter, and at once hastily and precipitately goes about
it, without mature deliberation, without consulting with himself, and
taking the advice of others in forming a scheme to bring about his
designs, it generally comes to nothing; see [Luk
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#028); or "without a secret" (s.md)
without keeping one; if a man divulges his intentions, it is much if
they are not frustrated; so the Targum,

"vain are the thoughts (or designs) where there is no secret;''

if a man makes no secret of what he designs to do, he is easily
counterworked, and his purposes disappointed;

but in the multitude of counsellors they are established; his purposes
are, as in [Pro 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#018.md); having the
advice of others, and these many, he is confirmed that he is right in
what he has thought of and purposed to do; and therefore goes about it
with the greater spirit and cheerfulness, and is most likely to succeed,
and generally does; see [Pro 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#014.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 15:23</span></span>

A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth,.... When his advice is asked,
and he gives good and wholesome counsel, and that being taken succeeds;
it is a pleasure to a man that he is capable of assisting his friend,
and doing him service, or a common good, whether it be in things
natural, civil, or religious; when his speech is with salt, seasoned
with grace, and he knows how he ought to answer every man; when that
which is good proceeds from him, and is to the use of edifying, and
ministers grace to the hearers, and is acceptable to them; when with
readiness he gives an answer to every man that asks him a reason of the
hope that is in him, with meekness and fear, [Col
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#006.md), [Eph
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#029.md);

and a word spoken in due season, how good is it? whether by way of
advice and counsel to such who stand in need of it, or of exhortation
and instruction to those that want it, or of comfort to those that are
distressed; such is a word of promise spoken and applied by the Spirit
of God to the hearts of his people in a time of need; and such is the
Gospel of peace, pardon, righteousness, and salvation, as spoken by
Christ and his ministers to weary and wounded souls; it cannot be well
and fully expressed how sweet, how good, how suitable, as well as
seasonable, it is: see [Pro 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#011.md).

[Proverbs 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 15:24</span></span>

The way of life is above to the wise,.... Of "the way of life"; See Gill
on [Pro 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#017.md); this is said to be
"above", or it tends "to what is above"; it leads to heaven and
happiness above; the life itself it is the way of or to is above, it is
hid with Christ in God; eternal life, glory, and happiness, is above; it
is a house eternal in the heavens, an inheritance reserved there, and
will be there enjoyed by the saints: the way to it is above; Christ is
the way, and he is in heaven, at the Father's right hand, through whom
only men can come at this life; wherefore those who are in the way of it
have their thoughts, their hearts, their affections and conversations,
above, [Mat 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#021.md). Faith, which deals
with Christ the way, and by which men walk in him, is signified by
soaring aloft, mounting up with wings as eagles, by entering within the
vail, and dwelling on high, and by looking upwards, and at things
unseen, and being the evidence of them. The Vulgate Latin version
renders it, "the way of life is above the learned man", or wise man; the
man that has no other than natural learning and wisdom, this way of life
and salvation by Christ lies out of his knowledge; it is what the most
sagacious and penetrating man could never discover; it is hid from the
wise and prudent, and revealed to babes; or this is only known to such
who are truly wise unto salvation; it is plain to them, and they highly
esteem it, and choose to walk in it; it is an "ascent to him that
understands", as the Syriac version renders it; it is a going up hill,
it is an ascending upwards and heavenwards; such a man is continually
looking upwards unto Christ, the author and finisher of his faith;
pressing towards him, the mark for the prize; keeping his eye, not on
things on earth, things temporal, which are seen here below, but on
things above, things unseen, which are eternal in the heavens;

that he may depart from hell beneath; not from the grave, as "sheol"
sometimes signifies: for wise men die as well as fools, and come to the
grave, which is the house appointed for all living; even those who are
in the way of life that is above do not escape death and the grave: but
such are secured from everlasting ruin and destruction, from being
destroyed soul and body in hell; they steer quite a different course and
road from that; every step they take upwards carries them so far off
from hell; which is the contrary way; the broad road of sin is the lower
way, or what leads to hell and destruction beneath; the narrow way of
faith in Christ is the upper way, and that leads to eternal life above.

[Proverbs 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 15:25</span></span>

The Lord will destroy the house of the proud,.... To whom he has the
utmost aversion; he sets himself against them and resists them, and will
not only destroy them, but their stately houses too, which their have
fancied shall continue for ever; and also their families, their children
and posterity; these shall be as stubble, and shall be burnt up in his
wrath, and neither root nor branch left. Moreover, the man of sin, the
son of perdition, may be more especially intended, that exalts himself
above all that is called God, with all the sons of pride supported by
him; his house, which is the house of the foolish and adulterous woman,
the idolatrous church of Rome, shall be rooted up; the city of Rome, the
seat of the beast itself, where his house or palace is, shall be
destroyed, and all that belong unto him, even all they that have
destroyed the earth, [Rev 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#018.md);

but he will establish the border of the widow; whose advocate, judge,
and defender he is; when men, rich, proud, and oppressive, attempt to
remove the landmark of the widow's border, and so lessen her land and
enlarge their own, God will not suffer it to be done, but will establish
it in its place; that is, such who are weak and helpless, as widows are,
and cannot defend themselves and their property, he will protect them
and secure it for them. So the church of Christ, during the reign of
antichrist, being obliged to flee into the wilderness, looks like a
widow deprived of her husband, and has but "little strength" to support
and defend herself, as is said of the church of Philadelphia, [Rev
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#008.md); yet the Lord will secure and
preserve her, and firmly settle and establish her, yea, enlarge her
borders, and make them of pleasant stones; spread the kingdom of Christ
from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth. Frequent
mention is made of the establishing of the church in the latter day,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 15:26</span></span>

The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the Lord,.... They are
known unto the Lord, who is the searcher of the heart, and a discerner
of the thoughts and intents of it; he knows they are vain and sinful,
yea, that they are only evil, and that continually, and therefore are
hateful and abominable to him; it may be rendered "the thoughts of
evil", as by the Targum; or evil thoughts, as the Septuagint, Vulgate
Latin, and the Oriental versions; but Aben Ezra interprets as we, the
thoughts of a wicked man, which are never otherwise but evil; whereas in
a good man, though there are many evil thoughts which are abominable to
himself, yet there are some good thoughts, and which are pleasing to the
Lord, as follows;

but the words of the pure are pleasant words; that is, unto the Lord;
which are the same with their thoughts, and are the effect of them, and
so stand opposed to the thoughts of the wicked; these, expressed either
in a way of prayer or of praise, are sweet and pleasant, and acceptable
unto God through Christ; as likewise their words and discourse in
religious conversation, which also minister grace unto the hearer, and
are very delightful and pleasing to saints; the words may be supplied
thus, "but the thoughts of the pure", of such who are pure in heart,
whose hearts are purified by faith in the blood of Christ, are "words of
pleasantness", so Gersom; there is a language in thought which is known
to a man's self, and by the Lord; there is the meditation or discourse
of the heart, and this being about divine and spiritual things is
pleasing to God; he hearkens to it, and writes a book of remembrance for
them that fear him, and have thought on his name; see [Psa
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#014.md).

He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house,.... Or "that covets a
covetousness" (t), an evil one, as in [Hab
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#009.md); that seeks riches by unlawful
means, that gathers the mammon of falsehood, or unrighteousness, as the
Targum; he entails a curse and brings ruin and destruction upon his
family; the Septuagint and Arabic versions are, he "destroys himself";
or "his own soul", as the Syriac version; it may be understood of a man
that is over anxious and eager to be rich, and hurries on business, and
gives his servants no proper time for food and rest; See Gill on [Pro
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#029.md);

but he that hateth gifts shall live; that rejects them with abhorrence,
when offered to bribe him to pervert judgment, or to do an unjust thing;
otherwise gifts may be lawfully received from one friend by another; the
sin is when they are given and taken for the sake of doing what is base
and sinful; and a man that shakes his hand from receiving gifts on such
a basis, he and his family shall prosper and increase in worldly things;
and, doing this from a right principle of grace, shall live comfortably
in a spiritual sense, and thrive and flourish in his soul, and live an
eternal life hereafter; see [Psa 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 15:28</span></span>

The heart of the righteous studieth to answer,.... He thinks before he
speaks, meditates what he shall say, what answer to give to men; whether
in things civil, natural, or religious; and what to return to the Lord
when he is reproved by him; or what to say in prayer to him, or by way
of thankfulness for mercies received from him; see [Pro
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#006.md); though our Lord advises his
disciples, when summoned before their persecutors, not to meditate
beforehand what they should answer, since they should have immediate
assistance, [Luk 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#014.md); but this was
in extraordinary cases; in common ones the observation of the wise man
should be attended to. A Jewish (u) writer renders the words, "the heart
of the righteous meditates wormwood", or bitter things; see [Pro
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#004.md); as the judgment of God, death,
and hell; this sense is mentioned by Aben Ezra, but rejected;

but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things; without any
previous thought and consideration, without fear or wit; in great
abundance, as water out of a fountain; thus an evil man out of the evil
treasure of his heart brings forth evil things readily and at once,
having no concern about the consequences of things, [Mat
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#025.md); See Gill on [Pro

The Lord is far from the wicked,.... Not as to his essence or powerful
presence, which is everywhere, for he is God omnipresent; but with
respect to his favour and good will, he is far from helping in distress,
and from hearing their cries when they apply unto him in desperate
circumstances; nor does he admit them to nearness and communion with him
now, as he does the righteous; nor will he receive them to himself at
the last day, but bid them depart from him; they are far from him and
from his law, and from all righteousness; and he is far from them, and
keeps them at a distance from him;

but he heareth the prayer of the righteous; they draw nigh to him, and
he draws nigh to them; he is nigh to all that call upon him in truth;
and there is none like them that has God so nigh them as they have; his
eyes are upon them, and his ears are open to their cries; he is a God
hearing and answering their prayers, and bestows upon them the favours
they ask for, and stand in need of.

[Proverbs 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">pro 15:30</span></span>

The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart,.... Not so much the visive
power, the faculty of seeing, a strong and clear eyesight; though this
is a great mercy, and from the Lord, and to be prized, and does give joy
of heart; but rather the objects seen by the light of the eyes, as
Jarchi; as green gardens, flowing rivers, pleasant meadows, rising
hills, lowly vales, herbs, plants, trees, birds, beasts, and creatures
of every kind; nor is the eye ever satisfied with seeing; especially
light itself beheld rejoiceth the heart, and particularly that grand
luminary and fountain of light, the sun. "Light is sweet", says the wise
man, [Ecc 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#007.md), "and a pleasant thing
it is for the eyes to behold the sun", which is a proper comment on this
text: and much more pleasant and delightful, cheering and rejoicing,
must be the spiritual light of the eyes of the understanding, when
opened by the Spirit of God at conversion; it is marvellous light souls
are then called into, and wonderful things do they then behold, which
rejoice their hearts; as Christ the sun of righteousness himself, the
light of the world, the glories of his person and office, the fulness of
grace that is in him, pardon of sin by his blood, justification by his
righteousness, and free and full salvation through him for the worst and
chief of sinners: in the light which is thrown into them they see light;
the light of God's countenance, his face and favour, which put gladness
into them; the light of the divine word, and the precious truths of it;
yea, the light, joy, and happiness of the world to come, in the hope of
which their hearts rejoice. Jarchi mystically interprets this of the
light of the eyes in the law; but it is much better to understand it of
the light of the eyes in the Gospel, and the mysteries of it;

and a good report maketh the bones fat; or "a good hearing" (w); not the
sense of hearing, or a quick exercise of that, though a very great
blessing; but things heard. Some understand this of a good or "fame"
(x), which is sometimes the sense of the phrase; either a good report
which a man hears of himself, which makes his spirit cheerful; and this
affects his body and the juices of it, which fill his bones with marrow,
and cover them with fatness; or which he hears of his friends, and is
pleasing to him, as it was to the Apostle John that Demetrius had a good
report of all men, [Jo3 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#012.md). But
rather this is to be understood of the good news, or good hearing, from
a far country, as the same phrase is rendered in [Pro
25:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#025.md); and here in the Arabic version
is so translated, even the Gospel, which is a report; see [Isa
53:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md); a report concerning God, the
perfections of his nature, the purposes of his heart, the covenant of
his grace, his love, grace, and mercy towards men in Christ Jesus; a
"report" concerning Christ, concerning his person and offices,
concerning his incarnation, obedience, sufferings, and death; concerning
his resurrection, ascension, sitting at the right hand of God,
intercession for his people, and second coming to judgment; and
concerning salvation, peace, pardon, righteousness, and eternal life by
him; a report concerning the good land, the heavenly Canaan, and the
glories of it, the way unto it, and the persons that shall possess it:
and this is a "good" report; it is good tidings of good things, a report
of good things laid up in covenant, which are come by Christ the great
High Priest, which saints are interested in, and shall partake of here
and hereafter; it is a true report, and to be believed, since it is made
by God himself, by Jesus Christ the faithful witness, and by the
apostles of Christ, who were eye and ear witnesses of the things they
reported; and such a report being heard, received, and embraced, greatly
contributes to the spiritual health and prosperity of the children of
God, it makes them fat and flourishing; such pleasant words are as the
honeycomb, sweet to the soul, make glad the heart, and are marrow and
health to the bones; see [Pro 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#008.md).

[Proverbs 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">pro 15:31</span></span>

The ear that heareth the reproof of life,.... That is given according to
the word of life, in a warm, fervent, and lively manner, with zeal, and
in good earnest; which reproves the life of another by his own, as well
as by words; and which tends to the spiritual and eternal life of the
person reproved; being taken, a man that diligently hearkens to, kindly
and cordially receives, and cheerfully obeys such reproof given him,

abideth among the wise; he not only chooseth to be among them, that he
may have the advantage of their wise counsels and reproofs, but he
becomes wise himself thereby, and attains to the character of a wise
man, and is numbered among them; such a man abides in the house of
wisdom, the church of God, and attends upon and has conversation with
the wise dispensers of the word, and shall have a part with them in the
church above, in the kingdom of heaven, where the wise will shine as the
firmament; the word here used does not denote a lodging for a night, as
it sometimes signifies, but a perpetual abiding.

[Proverbs 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">pro 15:32</span></span>

He that refuseth instruction,.... The instruction of parents, masters,
ministers, and of God himself; or "correction" (y), instruction either
by the word or by the rod; he that withdraws himself from it, will not
be in the way of it, that shuns, neglects, and despises it, or
carelessly and contemptuously attends it:

despiseth his own soul; shows that he makes no account of it, has no
regard for it or care about it, when it is so precious a jewel, and the
loss of it irreparable; not that a man can strictly and properly despise
his soul, but comparatively, having a greater regard for his body, and
especially for his carnal lusts and pleasures, than for that; or as a
man diseased and refuses proper medicines may be said to despise his
health;

but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding; or "a heart" (z); he
gets understanding by listening to reproof, and behaving according to
it; he better understands himself and his case, what he should shun and
avoid, what he should receive, embrace, and do; instead of losing his
soul, as the man that refuses correction does, he finds the life of it,
and possesses it, and with it a large share of experience and spiritual
wisdom.

castigatione", Piscator. (z) "cor", Pagninus, Piscator, Schultens,
Michaelis.

[Proverbs 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">pro 15:33</span></span>

The fear of the Lord is the instruction of wisdom,.... It is "the
beginning of wisdom", [Pro 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#010.md); it
leads unto it, instructs a man in it; by means of it he attains to true
spiritual and evangelical wisdom; it teaches him to abstain from sin,
and to serve the Lord; and to seek the salvation of his soul in the way
God has appointed, which is by his Son Jesus Christ, which to do is the
highest wisdom;

and before honour is humility; the fear of God and humility go together,
where the one is the other is; and as the one is the way to wisdom, the
other is the way to glory; Christ's humiliation was before his
exaltation; men are first humbled and laid low in their own eyes, and
then they are raised out of their low estate, and are set among princes;
and shall inherit the throne of glory, being made kings and priests unto
God; it is a frequent saying of Christ's, "he that humbleth himself
shall be exalted", [Luk 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#011.md); such an
one is raised to a high estate of grace, and at last to eternal glory.
