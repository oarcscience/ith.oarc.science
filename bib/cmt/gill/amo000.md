INTRODUCTION TO AMOS

This book in the Hebrew Bibles is called "Sepher Amos", the Book of
Amos; and, in the Vulgate Latin and Syriac versions, the Prophecy of
Amos. This is not the same person with the father of Isaiah, as some
have ignorantly confounded them; for their names are wrote with
different letters; besides, the father of Isaiah is thought to have been
of the royal family, and a courtier; whereas this man was a country
farmer and herdsman. His name signifies "burdened": the Jews (a) say he
was so called, because burdened in his tongue, or had an impediment in
his speech, and stammered; but rather because his prophecies were
burdens to the people, such as they could not bear, being full of
reproofs and threatenings; however, his prophecy in this respect agrees
with his name. What time he lived may be learned from [Amo
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md); by which it appears that he was,
contemporary with Isaiah and Hosea; but whether he lived and prophesied
so long as they did is not certain. The author of Seder Olam Zuta (b)
makes him to prophesy in the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and
Hezekiah. R. Abraham Zacut (c), and R. David Ganz (d), place him later
than Hosea, and prior to Isaiah; they say that Amos received the law
from Hosea, and Isaiah from Amos. Mr. Whiston (e) makes him to begin to
prophesy in the year of the world 3231 A.M. or 773 B.C.; and Mr. Bedford
(f) earlier, in 802 B.C.; and, from some passages in his prophecy, he
appears to be of the land of Judah; see [Amo
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md); though he prophesied in the land
of Israel, and against the ten tribes chiefly; the occasion of which
was, Jeroboam had been very successful and victorious, and the people
under him enjoyed great plenty and prosperity, and upon this grew
wanton, luxurious, and very sinful; wherefore this prophet was sent to
reprove them for their sins, to exhort them to repentance, and threaten
them with captivity, in case of impenitence; and to comfort the truly
godly with promises of the Messiah's coming and kingdom. The
authenticity of this book is not to be questioned, since many passages
out of it were taken by following prophets, as the words in [Amo
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#002.md), by Joel, [Joe
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#016.md), and by Jeremiah, [Jer
25:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#030.md); [Amo
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#009.md), by Haggai, [Hag
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#017.md); [Amo
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#013.md), by Joel, [Joe
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#018.md); and others are quoted by the
writers of the New Testament as divinely inspired, as [Amo
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#025.md), in [Act
7:42](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#042.md); nor is there any room to doubt
of his being the writer of this book, as is manifest of his speaking of
himself as the first person in it; though Hobbes (g) says it does not
appear. Some have thought that his language is rustic, suitable to his
former character and employment; but certain it is there are masterly
strokes and great beauties of eloquence in it; and which shows that it
is more than human. According to some writers, he was often beat and
buffeted by Amaziah, the priest of Bethel; and at last the son of the
priest drove a nail into his temples, upon which he was carried alive
into his own country, and there died, and was buried in the sepulchre of
his ancestors at Tekoa (h).
