INTRODUCTION TO 2 KINGS 23

This chapter treats of Josiah's reading the book of the law, and of him
and the people renewing the covenant with God, [Kg2
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#001.md), and of his removing idols and
idolatry in every shape, and witchcraft, out of the land, which he did
in the sincerity of his heart, [Kg2
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#004.md), yet the wrath of God was still
determined upon the land, [Kg2 23:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#026.md)
and Josiah was taken away by an untimely death, [Kg2
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#029.md) and was succeeded by two sons of
his, one after another, whose reigns were wicked, [Kg2
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#031.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 23:1</span></span>

And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of Judah
and of Jerusalem. Josiah sent messengers throughout the land, and
convened all the principal men in it at Jerusalem.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 23:2</span></span>

And the king went up into the house of the Lord,.... To the temple, from
his palace:

and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him:
they met him there:

and the priests, and the prophets; the prophets Jeremiah, Zephaniah, and
Uriah, who, though they might not be at Jerusalem when the book of the
law was found, yet, upon this message of the king's, might come up
thither from the countries where they were; the Targum interprets the
word "scribes": and some take them to be the sons of the prophets, their
disciples; in [Ch2 34:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#030.md) they are
called Levites:

and all the people, both small and great; a very numerous assembly:

and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant
which was found in the house of the Lord: that is, he caused it to be
read by others, and perhaps by more than one, the congregation being so
large.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 23:3</span></span>

And the king stood by a pillar,.... As the manner of kings was, [Kg2
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#014.md) and is thought to be the brasen
scaffold erected by Solomon, on which he stood at the dedication of the
temple, and now Josiah at the reading of the law, [Ch2
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#013.md), it is said to be his place, [Ch2
34:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#031.md); see Gill on [Kg2
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#014.md).

and made a covenant before the Lord: agreed and promised in the presence
of God, both he and his people:

to walk after the Lord: the worship of the Lord, as the Targum; closely
to attend to that:

and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes: all
the laws of God, moral, civil, and ceremonial:

with all their heart, and all their soul: cordially and sincerely:

to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book:
lately found, and now read unto them:

and all the people stood to the covenant: agreed to it, and promised to
keep it; so the Targum,"all the people took upon them the
covenant,''engaged to observe it.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 23:4</span></span>

And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the
second order,.... Or the second course of the priests; the course of
Jedaiah, [Ch1 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#007.md) as some think; or
rather, the two chief priests next to the high priest, who were of the
line both of Eleazar and Ithamar; though the Targum interprets it of the
Sagan of the priests, a deputy of the high priest, such as in later
times the high priest had always appointed for him on the day of
atonement (r):

and the keepers of the door: the porters at the door and gates of the
temple; or rather the treasurers, as the Targum; such as were appointed
over the vessels of the sanctuary, as the Jewish writers generally
interpret it, and which best agrees with what follows:

to bring forth out of the temple of the Lord all the vessels that were
made for Baal: used in burning incense, or offering sacrifices to him:

and for the grove: the idol of the grove, or Asherah, that is,
Ashtoreth, or Astarte, the same with Venus, or the moon, as Baal was the
sun, the one the husband, and the other the wife, according to the Jews
(s):

and for all the host of heaven: the stars:

and he burnt them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron; or plain of
Kidron, as the Targum; through which the brook Kidron ran:

and carried the ashes of them unto Bethel; where one of Jeroboam's
calves was set, and was the source of idolatry; and this he did in
contempt of that place; and, to show his detestation of the idolatry
there, he made it a dunghill of ashes of things used in idolatrous
service; this he could do, that place being in the hands of the kings of
Judah from the times of Ahijah, [Ch2
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#019.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 23:5</span></span>

And he put down the idolatrous priests,.... The Cemarim, so called,
because they wore black clothes, as Kimchi and others, whereas the
priests of the Lord were clothed in white linen; see Gill on [Zep
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#004.md).

whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places,
in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; for
though those high places were destroyed by Hezekiah, they were rebuilt
by Manasseh his son, and priests put in them to officiate there, whom
Josiah now deposed, [Kg2 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#003.md),

them also that burnt incense unto Baal; in the same high places; these
were the priests, and the others in the preceding clause are thought to
be ministers unto them:

to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets; the five planets
besides the sun and moon, as Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, and Venus;
or to the twelve celestial signs in the firmament, as some (t); though
Theodoret takes it to be a single star, the evening star:

and to all the host of heaven; or even to the host of heaven, all the
stars thereof: this part of worship:

burning incense, which was peculiar to the most high God, yet was
frequently made by idolaters to their deities; and from the word (u) by
which it is here and elsewhere expressed may "nectar" be derived, so
much spoken of by the Heathen poets as of a sweet smell (w), and as
delicious to their gods; and so Porphyry (x) represents the gods as
living on smoke, vapours, and perfumes; and frankincense is said, by
Diodorus Siculus (y), to be most grateful to them, and beloved by them;
this therefore is a much better derivation of the word "nectar" than
what Suidas (z) gives, that is, as if it was "nectar", because it makes
those young that drink it; or than the account Athenaeus (a) gives of
it, that it is a wine in Babylon so called.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 23:6</span></span>

And he brought out the grove from the house of the Lord,.... Not a real
grove of trees, but a carved one, as some think; or rather the image of
the grove, [Kg2 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#007.md) that is, the idol
Ashtoreth, or Astarte, which was set up there; so Theodoret says; some
interpreters call it Astoreth, the name of Venus, whom they call
Astarte: this Josiah ordered to be brought

without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burnt it at the brook
Kidron; the black brook, where the filth of the sacrifices was carried:

and stamped it small to powder; as Moses did the golden calf:

and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the
people; the common people, see [Jer
26:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#023.md) or rather on the graves of the
worshippers of idols, as it seems from [Ch2
34:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#004.md) the Targum is,"on the graves of
the children of Galia,''which, Kimchi says, is the name of an idol; this
was done partly in contempt of the idol, groves being, according to law,
impure; and partly to the reproach of the deceased, and the memory of
them, for their idolatry, and to deter from it those that survived them.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 23:7</span></span>

And he brake down the houses of the Sodomites that were by the house of
the Lord,.... Near the temple were apartments, in which men, the
worshippers of idols, prostituted their bodies to each other; committing
that unnatural sin with one another, which has its name from Sodom, and
from which those are so called, and which sin they committed in honour
of the idols they worshipped; to such vile affections were they, in a
judicial manner, delivered up, because of their idolatry; see [Rom
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#027.md) the word signifies "Holy Ones",
they being called so by an antiphrasis; though Abarbinel thinks these
were the idolatrous priests, whom the worshippers of idols reckoned
"holy", and so built houses for them near the temple to lodge in; the
Targum is,"and broke down the houses of things consecrated to
idols,''where they were put; and Theodoret on the place observes, that
by an homonymy, they called the demons or idols themselves "Holy Ones";
and it is not likely, indeed, that the Sodomites should be

where the women wove hangings for the grove; that is, for Astarte, as
the same writer observes: or "curtains", as the Jewish writers generally
interpret it, in which either the idol was enclosed, or these made
apartments for the idolaters to commit their abominable wickedness
privately; though the Syriac and Arabic versions are,"they wove garments
for the idols that were there;''and so the Septuagint version, of the
Complutensian edition; that is, they wove garments for the goddess
Astarte, which they dressed her with: the word signifies "houses", and
may mean the shrines of the idol made of woven work.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 23:8</span></span>

And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah,.... Who were
of the sons of Aaron, and had served in the high places there:

and defiled the high places where the priests had burnt incense; by
casting dead carcasses, or the bones of dead men, or dung, or anything
that was unclean, into them, by way of contempt:

from Geba to Beersheba; which were the northern and southern boundaries
of the land of Judah:

and brake down the high places of the gates: of the cities where some
think tutelar gods were placed to be worshipped by persons as they went
in or out of them: and particularly that

which were in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the
city, which were on a man's left hand at the gate of the city; of the
city of Jerusalem, where this Joshua was chief magistrate under the
king; at whose door stood an high place, which, Kimchi thinks, might he
greater than the rest, and therefore mentioned alone, yet was not spared
on account of its greatness, or of the person to whom it belonged.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 23:9</span></span>

Nevertheless, the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of
the Lord at Jerusalem,.... To sacrifice there, as the Targum; though
they were removed from the high places, they were not admitted to
officiate at the altar of the Lord, having offered in forbidden places:

but they did eat of the unleavened bread with their brethren; the
priests that were pure, as the sons of Zadok; though they might not
offer sacrifices, they were allowed to partake of the holy things with
the priests, as the meat offerings made of flour unleavened, [Lev
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#004.md) which are here meant, and put for
all the rest on which the priests lived, see [Eze
44:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#010.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 23:10</span></span>

And he defiled Topheth,.... A place so called, as is generally thought,
from the beating of drums or timbrels in it, that the shrieks of the
infants sacrificed here to Molech might not be heard by their parents,
and they repent of delivering them to him, and take them away. So the
Indians in India now, at the burning of wives with their deceased
husbands, attend them with drums and trumpets; and at such time as the
fire is put to the wood, the drums and trumpets make a terrible noise
for fear their cries should be heard (b); See Gill on [Isa
30:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#033.md), [Jer
7:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#031.md) this he defiled by casting any
sort of filth or unclean thing into it, in contempt of the idolatry
there committed, and to alienate the minds of men from it:

which is the valley of the children of Hinnom; a valley that belonged to
the posterity of a man of this name, near to Jerusalem, see [Jos
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#008.md), hence the Greek word "geenna"
for hell, in the New Testament:

that no man might make his son or his daughter pass through the fire to
Molech; which piece of idolatry used to be committed in this place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 23:11</span></span>

And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the
sun,.... Consecrated to it; these were not images of horses, as some
have thought, but real living ones; and the kings that gave them for the
service of the sun, and for sacrifice to it, very probably were Manasseh
and Amon: that horses were sacred to the sun with many Heathen nations,
as the Massagetae, a people in Scythia, and the Persians, and
Babylonians, and Ethiopians, is affirmed by various writers (c): and
from them the Jews received this notion. According to the Jewish
commentators, these were horses provided for the worshippers of the sun
to ride upon, and meet the sun in the morning at its rising, and pay
their homage to it; but certain it is that the Heathen nations before
mentioned slew the horses, and sacrificed them as burnt offerings to the
sun, as is asserted by Herodotus (d), Xenophon (e), Strabo (f),
Pausanias (g), Philostratus (h), and other writers (i); and so the
Indians of India (k) sacrificed them to Apollo, the same with the sun;
these being the swiftest of creatures, they offered them to the swiftest
of their gods, as Herodotus and Heliodorus observe, in the places before
referred to. The stables in which these horses were kept were

at the entering of the house of the Lord, by the chamber of Nathanmelech
the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs; so that they reached from the
temple to the suburbs of Jerusalem, to that part of them where this
officer had a chamber, or lodgings, being in some place of power and
authority there; though, according to L'Empereur (l), it is the same
with Parbar, [Ch1 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#018.md) and should not
be rendered "suburbs", it being between the compass or wall of the
temple, and the court:

and burnt the chariots of the sun with fire; these were either chariots,
in which the king and his nobles rode, when they went to meet and
worship the rising sun; or rather such as were sacred to the sun, as
well as the horses, or Josiah would not have burnt them; they seem to be
such in which the images of the sun were carried. Herodotus (m) makes
mention as of sacred horses, so of a sacred chariot. Xenophon (n) speaks
of the chariot of the sun as being of a white colour, and drawn in
procession at the worship of the sun; as does also Pausanias (o) of a
chariot, in which were the sun, Jupiter, and Juno, and near them other
deities; which notion of sacred chariots the Heathens might take from
the chariot of the cherubim Jehovah sat and rode in, [Ch1
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#018.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 23:12</span></span>

And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which
the kings of Judah had made,.... Which were on the roof of the royal
palace; the roofs of houses in Judah being flat, [Deu
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#008.md) altars might be built upon them;
so, in Arabia, altars were built on the tops of houses to offer incense
thereon daily to the sun (p); as here by Manasseh and Amon very
probably, which might be chosen because nearer the heavens; for which
reason the Heathens made use of high places to worship in, see [Jer
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#013.md).

and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of
the Lord; [Kg2 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#005.md).

did the king beat down; ordered to be demolished:

and brake them down from thence, and cast the dust of them into the
brook Kidron; that there might be no remains of them to be put to any
superstitious use.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 23:13</span></span>

And the high places that were before Jerusalem,.... Not only that were
within the city, and at the gates of it, but what were without it:

which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption: the mount of
Olives, so called from the idolatry and corrupt worship performed in it,
by way of reproach, with a small alteration of the letters of the word
for at the right hand, or south of this mountain, as the Targum; though
others say (q), on the north side of the mount of Olives, four furlongs
or half a mile from Jerusalem, were high places:

which Solomon king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination
of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and
for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon; of which See Gill
on [Kg1 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#005.md), [Kg1
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#007.md).

did the king defile; by casting unclean things into them. Rauwolff (r)
says,"before Mount Zion toward the south, at the other side of the
rivulet Kidron, lies the mount of transgression, called Mashith, [Kg2
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#013.md), this is higher and steeper than
any hereabout; there you still see some old walls of habitations,
wherein the concubines of Solomon did live;''and Mr. Maundrell (s)
observes, that below the hill stands now a village called Siloe, where
it is said he kept them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 23:14</span></span>

And he brake in pieces the images,.... Of Ashtoreth, Chemosh, and
Milcom, in the above high places; which as these high places had been
rebuilt by Manasseh or Amon, so new images of these deities were placed
there:

and cut down the groves; in which they were set:

and filled their places with the bones of men; of idolatrous priests and
worshippers, buried in parts adjacent; these he dug up and scattered in
the high places and groves to defile them, bones of the dead being by
law unclean, [Num 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#015.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 23:15</span></span>

Moreover, the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which
Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made. For the
worship of the calf there:

both that altar, and the high place, he brake down; according to an
ancient prophecy of the man of God, [Kg1
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#003.md) and of Amos in later times, [Amo
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#001.md).

and burnt the high place, and stamped it small to powder; that there
might be no remains of it:

and burnt the grove; either the grove of trees on it, or the idol that
was in it.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 23:16</span></span>

And as Josiah turned himself,.... From the high place, and the altar at
Bethel; for he not only gave orders for the destroying of idolatrous
places and idols, but he saw them executed himself:

he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount; the graves of
idolatrous priests and worshippers, who chose to be buried near those
places of idolatry; nor was it unusual for persons to be buried on hills
and mountains, see [Jos 24:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#030.md) and this
was a custom in other nations formerly (t), particularly among the
Indians (u) now, who in many things agree with the Jews:

and sent and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burnt them upon
the altar; where they had sacrificed to idols:

and polluted it; with their bones, which, according to the law, were
defiling, and which was done in contempt of their idolatrous worship
there:

according to the word of the Lord which the man of God proclaimed, who
proclaimed these words; or things; foretold that such a king by name
would arise, and burn men's bones upon the altar, and which had been
foretold more than three hundred and fifty years before this time.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 23:17</span></span>

Then he said, what title is that that I see?.... A high and large
monument over a grave, with an inscription on it, more remarkable than
any of the rest, which made Josiah take notice of it; and the Jews have
a tradition, as Kimchi observes, that on one side of the grave grew
nettles and thistles, and on the other side odoriferous herbs; which is
not to be depended on; but what he further observes may be right, that
the old prophet, as he gave orders to his sons to lay his body in the
same grave with the man of God, believing his words would be fulfilled,
so he likewise gave orders to have a distinguished monument or pillar
erected over the grave; and which people in later times took care to
support, in memory of the man of God, that thereby it might be known; by
which means not only the bones of the man of God were preserved from
being burnt, but those of the old prophet also, buried with him:

and the men of the city told him, it is the sepulchre of the man of God,
which came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done
against the altar of Bethel; see [Kg1
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#001.md).

And he said, let him alone, let no man move his bones,.... Not take them
out of the grave, as they had done the rest:

so they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out
of Samaria; the old prophet, whereby his end was answered in being
buried with him, [Kg1 13:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#031.md).

And all the houses also of the high places,.... The temples of the idols
there, and the houses for the priests to dwell in:

that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made
to provoke the Lord to anger, Josiah took away; particularly in the
cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, unto Naphtali, [Ch2
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#006.md) the Israelites that remained
there acknowledging Josiah as their king; and perhaps, after the defeat
of Sennacherib, many of the cities of Israel might put themselves under
the protection of Hezekiah, and especially upon the destruction of the
Assyrian empire; and Manasseh, with his liberty, might have his kingdom
enlarged by the king of Babylon; and which being continued and increased
in the times of Josiah, might be the reason of his opposing the king of
Egypt in favour of the king of Babylon:

and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel;
defiled them, and broke down the altars in them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 23:20</span></span>

And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there,.... The
idolatrous priests who sacrificed to Baal, and other Heathen deities;
for as for others that burnt incense in high places, yet to the true
God, those he spared, though they were not suffered to officiate at the
altar of God: the others he slew

upon the altars; where they sacrificed:

and burnt men's bones upon them: the bones of the priests, and
worshippers of idols, as he had done at Bethel:

and returned to Jerusalem; after he had gone through the land, both of
Judah and Israel, and abolished idolatrous worship everywhere.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 23:21</span></span>

And the king commanded all the people,.... Not at Jerusalem only, but
throughout the whole kingdom: saying:

keep the passover unto the Lord your God, as it is written in this book
of the covenant; which had been lately found and read, and they had
agreed to observe, and in which this ordinance was strictly enjoined,
and was a commemoration of their deliverance out of Egypt, and a
direction of their faith to the Messiah, the antitype of the passover.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg2 23:22</span></span>

Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the judges
that judged Israel,.... As the king commanded; the people obeyed and
kept the passover, according to the law of the Lord; the manner of its
being kept is not here recorded, but is at large in [Ch2
35:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#001.md) where it is observed there had
not been such an one from the days of Samuel, the last of the judges; so
that the days of the judges here mean the last days of them:

nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;
since the division of the kingdoms; for as for the kings of Israel, they
kept it not; and though it was observed in the times of Hezekiah king of
Judah, yet not universally, and by some in their uncleanness; for it is
a mistake of Clemens of Alexandria (w), that it was not kept in the
times between Samuel and Josiah; in the days of David and Solomon it
might be kept by greater numbers, but not with such purity, and with
such cheerfulness and joy of heart, or with so many other sacrifices
attending it, or so exactly agreeable to the law of God, and with such
munificence and liberality; the king, and the chief of the priests and
Levites, providing out of their own substance for the people and their
brethren.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 23:23</span></span>

But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, wherein this passover was
holden to the Lord in Jerusalem. This shows that Josiah must begin the
reformation very early that year, since he did all that is before
recorded in this and the preceding chapter by the fourteenth of Nisan,
the day on which the passover was kept, which month answers to part of
our March and part of April, see [Kg2
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#003.md) and was the same year the repairs
of the temple were finished.

Moreover, the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards,.... Who
were not to be allowed among the Israelites, [Deu
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#010.md).

and the images; or teraphim: and the idols, and all the abominations;
which were worshipped by the Heathens, and introduced among the Jews,
and forbidden by the word of God:

that were spied in the land of Judah, and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put
away; for which, it seems, diligent search was made, and wherever they
were discovered were removed:

that he might perform the words of the law, which were written in the
book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the Lord; both with
respect to witchcraft and idolatry, see [Lev
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#027.md).

And like unto him was there no king before him,.... The same is said of
Hezekiah, [Kg2 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#005.md), Hezekiah might
excel him in some things, as Josiah might excel Hezekiah in others:

that turned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his soul, and
with all his might; with such sincerity, heartiness, zeal, and
constancy:

according to all the law of Moses; having respect to every commandment,
especially relative to worship, with the greatest precision and
exactness:

neither after him arose there any like him; for all to the captivity
were wicked princes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg2 23:26</span></span>

Notwithstanding, the Lord turned not from the fierceness of his great
wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah,....
Notwithstanding the great reformation wrought among them; for though
Josiah was a sincere reformer, and did what he did heartily, as to the
Lord, according to his will, and for his glory; yet the people were not
sincere in their compliance, they turned to the Lord not with their
whole heart, but feignedly, [Jer 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#010.md).

because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal;
by shedding innocent blood and committing idolatry, which the people
consented to and approved of, and even now privately committed idolatry,
as the prophecies of Jeremiah and Zephaniah show; and it may easily be
concluded that their hearts were after their idols, by their openly
returning to them in the days of the sons of Josiah.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 23:27</span></span>

And the Lord said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have
removed Israel. Not from his all seeing eye, but from being the object
of his special care and protection; the meaning is, that he would suffer
them to he carried out of their land into captivity as Israel was; this
he had said in his heart, was determined upon; the decree was gone
forth, and it was irrevocable:

and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I have chosen: for the place
of his worship, the people having forsaken his worship there, and
followed after idols:

and the house of which I said, my name shall be there; the temple,
called after his name, and where his name was to be, and had been,
called upon.

Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did,.... For
abolishing idolatry, and restoring the true worship of God:

are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
Judah? and also of Israel, in which an account was kept of the
transactions of their reign; many other of the acts of Josiah are
recorded in the canonical book of Chronicles, [Ch2
34:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#001.md).

In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt,.... Who is called in the Targum
Pharaoh the lame, because he was lame in his feet, perhaps gouty;
Herodotus (x) also calls him Necos the son of Psammiticus; now it was in
the last days of Josiah this king reigned in Egypt, or however that the
following event was:

that he went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates; to
Carchemish, a city situated upon it; see [Ch2
35:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#026.md), the king he went against was
the king of Babylon, who had conquered the Assyrian monarchy, and
therefore called king of it; some take him to be Nabopolassar; according
to Marsham (y), he was Chyniladanus:

and King Josiah went against him; to stop him, that he might not pass
through his country, and attack the king of Babylon, whose ally,
perhaps, Josiah was; or, however, thought himself obliged to him by the
privileges, power, and authority he allowed him to exercise in the land
of Israel:

and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him; as soon as they came
face to face, and engaged in battle, see [Kg2
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#008.md) that is Pharaoh slew Josiah at
the first onset. Megiddo was a city in the tribe of Manasseh, [Jos
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011). Herodotus (z.md) calls it
Magdolus, which seems to be a city on the borders of Egypt, the same
with Migdol, [Jer 44:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#001.md) where he says
Pharoahnechoh conquered the Syrians; in Josephus (a) it is called Mendes
very wrongly. Josiah seems to have engaged in this action without
consulting the Lord and his prophets.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg2 23:30</span></span>

And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo,.... They
took him out of the chariot in which he was wounded, and put him into
another, where he died of his wounds by the way; being mortally wounded,
he is said to be dead, or a dead man, see [Ch2
35:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#024.md).

and brought him to Jerusalem; which, according to Bunting (b), was forty
four miles from Megiddo:

and buried him in his own sepulchre; which either he had provided for
himself in his lifetime, or which in common belonged to the kings of
Judah, see [Ch2 35:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#024.md).

and the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed
him, and made him king in his father's stead; though he was not the
eldest son, Jehoiakim, who was afterwards placed in his room, being two
years older, as appears from [Kg2
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#031.md) and this is the reason, as the
Jewish commentators in general agree, that he was anointed; which they
say was never done to the son of a king, unless there was a competitor,
or some objection to, or dispute about, the succession, as in the case
of Solomon and others.

Jehoahaz was twenty three years old when he began to reign,.... Who
seems to be the same with Shallum, [Jer
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#011.md).

and he reigned three months in Jerusalem; a short reign, being deposed
by the king of Egypt, as after related:

and his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah; a
city in the tribe of Judah, [Jos
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#029.md).

And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord,.... Committed
idolatry:

according to all that his fathers had done; his grand father and great
grandfather, Amon and Manasseh; so soon after Josiah's death was the
revolt to idolatry.

And Pharaohnechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath,....
Places in Syria; Hamath was formerly a kingdom in Syria, and Riblah is
said by Jerom (c) to be Antioch of Syria, near to which was the fountain
of Daphne; and in the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem on [Num
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#011.md). Daphne is put for Riblah; and
Josephus (d) says Antioch was by Daphne of Syria; and in the
Apocrypha:"Which when Onias knew of a surety, he reproved him, and
withdrew himself into a sanctuary at Daphne, that lieth by Antiochia.''
(2 Maccabees 4:33)Daphne is said to be by Antioch; with which place
Pompey was greatly delighted, because of the pleasantness of it, and the
abundance of waters about it (e): hither, it is probable, Jehoahaz went
with an army to avenge his father's death on the king of Egypt, or to
assist the king of Babylon, or both; and here Pharaoh met with him, and
took him, and bound him; he seems to be of a martial spirit, from [Eze
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#003.md).

that he might not reign in Jerusalem; whither afterwards the king of
Egypt came, and took it; and so Herodotus (f) says that after he had
conquered the Syrians at Migdol, he took Cadytis, a great city of Syria,
which seems to be Jerusalem, the holy city:

and put the land to a tribute of one hundred talents of silver, and a
talent of gold; the land of Judah; and one hundred talents, according to
Bunting (g), amounted to 37,500 pounds of our money; and a talent of
gold, according to Brerewood (h), was 4,500 pounds; but Bishop
Cumberland (i) makes it 5,067 pounds, three shillings, and ten pence; a
talent of gold could not be so large in Homer's time, since he speaks of
seven of them given at once in a way of hospitality (k).

And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of
Josiah his father,.... Not in the room of Jehoahaz; for he did not allow
him to be a king, and to have any lawful right to the throne; but,
deposing him, set up his elder brother:

and turned his name to Jehoiakim; to show his subjection to him, and
that he held his government by him:

and took Jehoahaz away: with him, from Jerusalem, when he departed
thence:

and he came to Egypt, and died there: and never returned to Jerusalem,
according to the prophecy of Jeremiah, [Jer
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#011.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">kg2 23:35</span></span>

And Jehoiakim gave the silver and gold to Pharaoh,.... The one hundred
talents of silver and the talent of gold, which he imposed as a tribute
upon the land:

but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of
Pharaoh; he did not take it out of his own treasures nor the treasures
of the house of the Lord, which perhaps might be exhausted, but levied
it of the people of the land:

he exacted the silver and gold of the people of the land, required them
to pay it in:

of everyone according to his taxation, to give it unto Pharaohnechoh:
everyone was taxed according to his abilities, in proportion to what he
was worth, or to the estate he was possessed of.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">kg2 23:36</span></span>

Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign,.... And
therefore must be two years older than his brother Jehoahaz, who was
deposed:

and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and therefore must die at the
age of thirty and six:

and his mother's name was Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah;
which Josephus (l) calls Abuma; but he speaks of a village in Galilee
called Ruma (m); but whether the same with this is not certain.
