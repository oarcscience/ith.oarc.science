INTRODUCTION TO EZEKIEL 47

This chapter gives an account of the vision of the holy waters, and of
the borders of the holy land, and the division of it to Israelites and
strangers. The waters are described by the original and spring of them,
[Eze 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#001.md), by the progress and
increase of them, [Eze 47:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#003.md), by the
healing and quickening nature of them, and the places where they were
so, and were not, [Eze 47:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#008.md), and by
the trees which grew upon the banks of them, [Eze
47:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#006.md). The borders of the holy land are
fixed, [Eze 47:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#013.md), the northern
border, [Eze 47:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#015.md), the eastern
border, [Eze 47:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#018.md), the southern, [Eze
47:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#019.md), and the western, [Eze
47:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#020.md), which is to be divided by lot
to the tribes of Israel, and the strangers that sojourn among them, [Eze
47:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#021.md).

[Ezekiel 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 47:1</span></span>

Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house,.... The door
of the temple, even of the holy of holies; hither the prophet is said to
be brought again, or "brought back" (x); for he was last in the corners
of the outward court, viewing the kitchens or boiling places of the
ministers; but now he was brought back into the inner court, and to the
door that led into the holiest of all:

and, behold! for it was matter of admiration, as well as of observation
and attention:

waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward; this
is a new thing, to which there was nothing like it, either in the first
or second temple. Ariateas (y) indeed relates what he himself saw,

"a never failing conflux of water, as of a large fountain, naturally
flowing underneath, and wonderful receptacles under ground; to each of
which were leaden pipes, through which the waters came in on every side,
for about half a mile about the temple, and washed away the blood of the
sacrifices;''

and so the Talmudists (z) say, there was an aqueduct from the fountain
of Etam, and pipes laid from thence to supply the temple with water, for
the washing and boiling of the sacrifices, and keeping the temple clean:
but these waters are quite different; they are such as came out of the
temple, and not what were carried by pipes into it; nor were they a
common sewer to carry off the filth of it, but formed a delightful and
useful river. The fountain of them is not declared, only where they were
first seen to issue out,

under the threshold of the house eastward; the threshold of the door of
the most holy place; so that they seem to take their rise from the holy
of holies, the seat of the divine Majesty, and throne of God, with which
agrees [Rev 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#001.md), and so the
Talmudists (a) say, that this fountain came first from the house of the
holy of holies, under the threshold of the door of it, which looked to
the east:

for the fore front of the house stood toward the east; the holy of
holies was at the west end of the temple; but the front of it, and so
the door into it, was to the east, and from hence these waters flowed:

and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house;
they are said to "come down", because the temple was high built upon the
top of a mountain; and "from under", that is, the threshold of the door
of it; or rather in subterraneous passages, till they appeared from
under that; and this was "on the right side of the house"; that is, on
the south side: for, suppose a man standing with his face to the east,
as the prophet did, when he turned himself to see which way the waters
flowed, having his face to the west when he first saw them come out; the
south then must be on his right hand, and so it follows:

at the south side of the altar; of the altar of burnt offerings, which
stood before the house.

[Ezekiel 47:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 47:2</span></span>

Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward,.... Out of the
inward court where he was, by the way of the north gate, the eastern
gate being shut:

and led me about the way without unto the utter gate, by the way that
looketh eastward; and from thence he had him round to the outward
eastern gate, where he was at first, [Eze
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#006.md), to meet the flow of waters that
came through the inward and outward courts eastward:

and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side; that is, on the
south side of the gate, in a small quantity, and in a very still and
easy way, like water out of the mouth of a vial, as the word (b)
signifies. So Bartenora (c), who understands this gate of the water
gate, interprets the right side of the south; and observes, that the
prophet first saw the waters come out very small, like the horns of a
locust; but when they came to this gate, they became like water as it
flows out of the mouth of a small pitcher: and from this whole account
of the waters, it is plain they cannot be understood literally, but
figuratively; and which confirm this to be the sense of the whole
vision. They may be applied unto, and serve to illustrate, the love of
God; the secret spring of which is in the heart and will of God; ran
under ground from all eternity; channelled in Christ; broke up and
issued forth in the mission of him into the world, under the threshold
of him, the door of the church; and in and by him, the altar, sacrifice,
and propitiation; wherein the love of God in an especial manner is
manifested; and which has its heights and depths, immeasurable and
unfathomable, [Eph 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#018.md), these waters
also may be applied to the grace of the Spirit of God in regeneration
and conversion; which is compared to water, for its cleansing,
fructifying, and refreshing nature; to "waters", for the abundance of
it; and this flows from the God of all grace through Christ, and out of
his fulness is gradually increased, and becomes a well, yea, rivers of
living water, [Joh 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037.md), but it seems
best to understand them of the Gospel, and the doctrines of it; which,
like water, cools those who are inflamed with the heat of the fiery law;
extinguishes the thirst of sensible sinners, and refreshes them;
cleanses and purifies their souls, which is instrumentally done with the
washing of water by the word; and makes them fruitful and flourishing:
this is not of men, but God; comes from heaven, the holy of holies; and
out of the house and church of God; from Zion and Jerusalem, by Christ
the door, and points to him the way; and is chiefly concerning him, the
altar, his sacrifice and satisfaction, peace, atonement, and
propitiation by him; see [Isa 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003.md).

[Ezekiel 47:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 47:3</span></span>

And when the man that had the line in his hand,.... The same as in [Eze
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#003.md) and is no other than Christ, who
appeared in a human form to the prophet; and who hitherto had only made
use of the measuring reed in taking the dimensions of the house, and
what appertained to it; but now he uses the line of flax he had in his
hand, in measuring the waters as they ran; by which line is meant the
Scriptures, the word of God, by which all doctrines are to be measured:
this is the rule that both preachers and hearers are to go by; and, as
by the direction of this person the waters flowed where he would have
them, so the doctrines of the Gospel are preached by the order of Christ
where he pleases; see [Luk 24:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#047.md), and
these move in a direct line, as those waters did; error is crooked, and
has its windings and turnings; but truth is straight and even; all the
words of Wisdom are right, and there is nothing froward, perverse, or
crooked in them, [Pro 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#008.md),

went forth eastward; which was the course the waters took by his
direction; the Gospel was first spread in the eastern part of the world,
in Asia, where many churches were planted by it; it has been since in
the south, in Africa, particularly in the times of Austin, when these
waters, the doctrines of grace, flowed largely; and they have been since
in the north and west, in Europe, in our northern climes; all which
perhaps may be signified by the right side, or south side, by which
these waters flowed, and by the prophet's going to the north gate, and
about, to see them; but in the latter day they will move eastward again,
when the kings of the east and their kingdoms shall become Christ's; see
[Rev 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#012.md),

he measured a thousand cubits; or, "a thousand by the cubit (d)"; the
Targum is,

"a thousand cubits by the cubit;''

with his line from the eastern gate of the house, at the right side of
which the waters ran out; this was about half a mile:

and he brought me through the waters: not the thousand cubits he had
measured; but when he came to the end of them, he made the prophet to
cross the waters, to go through them across, that he might observe the
depth of them:

and the waters were to the ankles; were ankle deep, a few inches: or,
"to the soles"; for, as R. Jonah thinks, may be additional; and in the
Syriac language, signifies a part of the hand, [Dan
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#005.md), and, applied to the feet, designs
the soles of them; and then the sense is, the waters were so shallow,
that they only covered the soles of the feet: this may signify the
ministry of John the Baptist, who, though greater than the prophets, yet
the least in the kingdom of heaven was greater than he; and of the
disciples of Christ, before the effusion of the Spirit: or may design
the more easy doctrines of the Gospel; those waters which Christ's lambs
may wade in; that milk which new born babes desire, and are fed with;
those plain truths of the word, which those of the weakest capacity are
able to take in, receive, and embrace; in the knowledge of which, though
fools, they err not; such as salvation by Christ alone; justification by
his righteousness; peace and pardon by his blood; which are so plain, as
to be understood by every truly gracious soul, though of ever so mean a
capacity: or it may intimate the small spread of the Gospel at first in
Judea, Samaria, and Galilee.

[Ezekiel 47:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 47:4</span></span>

And again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters; the
waters were to the knees,.... The man with his line measured another
thousand cubits straight on from the first; and then bid the prophet
cross and ford them again, and then they were knee deep:

again he measured a thousand, and brought me through; the waters were to
the loins; a third time he measured a thousand cubits still onward, and
ordered the prophet to wade through them, when they were risen so high
as to reach his loins. The waters to the knees and loins may signify the
greater knowledge of the Gospel, and the mysteries of it, the apostles
had after the Spirit was poured forth; and the greater spread of it in
the world, among Jews and Gentiles: or else may design those doctrines
of the Gospel, and mysteries of grace, which are more sublime, and more
difficult to understand; which require some pains to search into, and
get the knowledge of; as concerning predestination, election, the
covenant of grace, and the eternal transactions between the Father and
the Son, &c. which are meat for strong men, who have their senses
exercised to discern between good and evil.

[Ezekiel 47:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 47:5</span></span>

Afterward he measured a thousand,.... A fourth time a thousand cubits.
Some think these four measurings respect the preaching of the Gospel in
the four parts of the world; but rather they refer to four remarkable
seasons of the ministry of it; as in the times of John the Baptist, and
the disciples of Christ before his death; in the primitive churches of
the three first centuries; at the time of the Reformation; and in the
latter day glory, which is the fourth and last measuring:

and it was a river that I could not pass over; the prophet could not set
his foot on the bottom, and wade through it, and cross over it, as he
had done before:

for the waters were risen, waters to swim in; not to walk in:

a river that could not be passed over; by any man, on his feet; only by
swimming, and perhaps not by that, at least not without difficulty: this
may signify the large spread of the Gospel in the latter day, when the
earth shall be filled with it, as the waters cover the sea; and the
great light into it, and knowledge of it, that men shall then have, [Isa
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#009.md), and yet that there are some
doctrines exceeding deep, out of the reach and penetration of men,
called the deep things of God, which human reason cannot attain, and
where it cannot fix its foot, [Co1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009.md), and which are only to be reached
and embraced in the swimming arms of faith; and, though believed, cannot
be accounted for, as to the modus of them, and are not to be dived into;
such as the trinity of Persons in the Godhead, and the distinct manner
of their subsisting in it; the generation of the Son; the procession of
the Spirit; the incarnation of Christ; the union of the two natures in
his person; the resurrection of the dead, &c.

[Ezekiel 47:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 47:6</span></span>

And he said unto me, son of man, hast thou seen this? &c. That is, the
man that measured the waters said to the prophet, hast thou carefully
observed all this from whence the waters flowed? from what small
beginnings they rose, and gradually increased? how they first issued
forth, as out of a vial; and now, in the space of about two or three
miles, are become a deep river, and impassable? it is right and
profitable to observe the rise and progress of the Gospel; what a spread
it has had in the world, and what it will have:

then he brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river;
there to stand and observe the nature of the waters, and the course of
them; the multitude of fish in them; and the trees which grew upon the
banks of them; of all which some account is given in the following
verses.

[Ezekiel 47:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 47:7</span></span>

Now when I had returned,.... To the brink of the river:

behold, at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side,
and on the other; here was a new wonder observed, which had not been
before; and therefore this note of admiration, "behold!" is prefixed; on
a sudden sprung up trees on each side of the river, of a perfect
stature, and full of fruit; which the prophet had not seen when he went
along with the man on the bank of it, as he measured the waters; but now
being returned, sees this wonderful sight; an emblem of true Christians,
believers, and regenerate persons, who are trees of righteousness,
planted by the river of divine love; watered with the grace of God, and
doctrines of the Gospel; whereby they become fruitful in good works, and
are to be seen wherever the Gospel comes with power and efficacy; see
[Psa 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003.md), or, "an exceeding large
tree" (e); so John saw but one tree, which was on each side of the
river, which he calls the tree of life, [Rev
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#002.md), but here it seems to be put for
many, as appears from [Eze 47:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#012.md).

[Ezekiel 47:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 47:8</span></span>

Then said he unto me,.... The man that measured the waters spoke to the
prophet again, and showed him the course of the waters; the quickening
and healing virtue of them, and the multitude of fish in them:

these waters issue out toward the east country; the Gospel was first
preached in the eastern parts of the world; See Gill on [Eze
47:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#003.md), or "towards the first, or east
Galilee" (f); in Galilee Christ began to preach, and wrought his first
miracle; here he called his disciples, and chiefly conversed; and here
he had the greatest followers, and some of the first Christian churches
were formed here after his ascension, [Mat
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#012.md),

and go down into the desert; or wilderness, the wilderness of the
people, the Gentiles; to whom the Gospel was carried when rejected by
the Jews, and who before were like a desert, but now became as a
fruitful field, [Isa 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001.md). The Jews
(g) interpret this of the plain, or the sea of Galilee or Tiberius, at
which Christ called his disciples; near to this he delivered his
discourses concerning himself, the bread of life, and eating his flesh,
and drinking his blood; here he met with his disciples after his
resurrection, and enjoined Peter to feed his sheep and lambs; see [Mat
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#018.md),

and go into the sea; the Dead sea, or sea of Sodom, the lake
Asphaltites, where nothing is said to live; an emblem of dead sinners;
and may represent the worst of sinners, as the Sodomites were; and to
such the Gospel was sent, and became effectual to salvation: or it may
rather design the great ocean, and may signify the whole world, and all
the nations of it, to which the Gospel, by the commission of Christ, was
to be preached; see [Dan 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#002.md). The
Targum is,

"and go through the sea into the great sea;''

it may be rendered, "and go toward the west" (h); the Mediterranean sea
being to the west of Judea, it is often put for the west; and so the
sense may be, that these waters should flow east and west, as the living
waters in [Zac 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#008.md), the same with
those, are said to do; and all the Jewish writers think there is such a
division of the waters intended, and that they had two streams or
rivers; which may receive some confirmation from the next verse, where
the word for rivers is of the dual number, and signifies two rivers. The
sense of the whole is, that the Gospel should be first preached in Judea
and Galilee; then among the Gentiles throughout the Roman empire; and in
the latter day especially throughout the world, when it shall be covered
with it as the waters cover the sea, [Isa
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#009.md),

which being brought forth into the sea, the waters shall be healed; that
is, which waters of the river being directed and brought into, either
the Dead sea, or the great ocean, the waters of the one, or of the
other, were healed; and of bituminous and bitter waters were made clear,
sweet, and wholesome; and signify the change made in sinful men by means
of the Gospel, who are thereby quickened, made partakers of the grace of
God, and have their sins pardoned, which is often meant by healing in
Scripture, [Psa 103:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#002.md), pardon of sin
flows from the love and grace of God; is the great doctrine of the
Gospel, and by which the Lord speaks peace and pardon, and communicates
healing of all spiritual diseases to sinners sensible of them; see [Psa
107:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#020.md).

[Ezekiel 47:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 47:9</span></span>

And it shall come to pass that everything that liveth, which moveth,....
That is, every living man; everyone that lives naturally or corporeally,
that lives, moves, and has his being in God, as all men have, [Act
17:28](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#028.md),

whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live; or, "the two rivers"
(i); the waters divided as before, east and west; not the two
Testaments, Old and New; nor the two ordinances of baptism and the
Lord's supper; but the Gospel, which, wherever it shall come with power,
and to whomsoever it so comes, they shall live spiritually; not to
whomsoever it is preached, for to some it is not profitable; see [Eze
47:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#011.md), but is the savour of death unto
death; but to all to whom it is accompanied by the Spirit of God it is
the savour of life unto life; the Spirit that gives life, and is the
means of it: indeed, the love of God is the river of water of life, [Rev
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001.md), it is the spring of spiritual
life to dead sinners, and what revives drooping saints, quickens their
graces, faith, hope, and love; enlivens and cheers their spirits, and
greatly influences true religion and godliness, and very much promotes
the life and power of it: and so the grace of the Spirit is living
water, by which dead sinners are quickened; the work of grace in saints
is revived, and which always continues and issues in eternal life, [Joh
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#010.md), but the Gospel, and its
doctrines, are rather intended; which are the means of quickening those
who are dead in trespasses and sins; serve greatly to invigorate the
graces of the Spirit in the hearts of God's people; to influence their
lives and conversations; to support them under afflictions, and to
nourish them up to everlasting life; and point out the way to eternal
life, and give a true account of it.

And there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters
shall come thither; that is, a multitude of fish in the Dead sea, where
none lived before, and owing to those waters coming thither: it
signifies the great number of living Christians, true believers, who
shall appear wherever the Gospel is truly, purely, and powerfully
preached; of these see more in the next verse:

for they shall be healed; See Gill on [Eze
47:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#008.md),

and everything shall live whither the river cometh; not only shall live
as before, but continue to live, shall never die; their graces shall not
die, nor shall they themselves die the second death, but shall have
eternal life; because of the purpose of God, who has ordained them to
it; and the promise of God, who is faithful to it; and because of the
security of their life in Christ, to whom they are united; and because
of the indwelling of the Spirit of life in them. So the Targum,

"they shall remain in every place where the waters of the river come.''

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 47:10</span></span>

And it shall come to pass,.... In Gospel times: what follows had a
fulfilment in the first times of the Gospel, and will have a greater in
the latter times of it:

that the fishers shall stand upon it; upon the brink of the river, or
the shore of the sea, whose waters will be healed by this river running
into them. These "fishers" are the apostles of Christ, who, of
fishermen, were made fishers of men by him; to whom he gave a call, and
a commission, and gifts qualifying them to preach the Gospel; whereby
they caught men, and brought them to Christ; and so were the instruments
of saving them, even of great numbers, both in Judea, and in the Gentile
world; of which some instances of their fishing, after their call to the
ministry, were emblematical; [Mat
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#018.md), likewise all other ministers of
the Gospel are here meant, especially those that will be in the latter
day; compared to fishers for the meanness and contemptibleness of their
employment in the eyes of the world; for their labouriousness in it, and
for their patient waiting for success therein; and for the bad weather,
storms, and tempests, they are exposed unto, the reproach and
persecution of men; and their being the happy means of drawing souls out
of the abyss of sin and misery unto Christ, for life and salvation: and
their "standing" upon the brink of the waters to catch fish may denote
their constancy their work; their strict attachment to the doctrines of
the Gospel, and their waiting for success in it.

From Engedi even unto Eneglaim; two places, which, according to Jerom,
lay, the latter one at the entrance of the Dead sea, and the former at
the end of it; but Reland (k) observes that this could not be, if
Josephus is to be credited, who makes Engedi to be about forty miles
from Jerusalem (l); therefore could not be far from the beginning of the
Dead sea, and not where it ended; since the Dead sea, or the lake of
Asphaltites, was in length seventy three miles, and, consequently,
Engedi must be more than seventy five or ninety miles from Jerusalem;
but that it was at the beginning of it is still further manifest from
the same writer making the lake to be just such a number of miles from
Jerusalem (m) as he does Engedi; and whereas Engedi was on the western
shore of the lake, as appears from Pliny (n), it is probable there was
another city on the eastern shore, opposite to it, called Eneglaim; and
there was a city on that side, the name of which was Agallim, which,
according to Eusebius, was eight miles from Areopolis: and so it may
signify the extent of the Gospel ministry, which, in the latter day,
will be from one end of the earth to the other; and which took a large
circuit in the times of the apostles, and particularly by the Apostle
Paul, [Rom 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#019.md).

They shall be a place to spread forth nets; that is, the above said
places shall be made use of for that purpose; which design the Gospel,
and the ministry of it, compared to a net, for its meanness in the
esteem of the world; and yet is a piece of curious artifice and wisdom,
even the manifold wisdom of God, and is contrived for the gathering in
of sinners to Christ; and, though it may be like a net "per accidens",
the means of troubling the world, and drawing out the corruptions of the
men of it; yet its principal design, and the use that is made of it, is
to draw souls out of the depths of sin unto the grace of Christ; see
[Mat 13:47](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#047.md), the spreading and casting
of nets design the preaching of the Gospel, and the opening and
explaining the doctrines of it, which are shut up and hidden to men; and
to do which requires wisdom and skill, strength, diligence, and
patience, and is done at a venture; and sometimes is cast where fish
are, and sometimes not; but here, and at this time, with great success.

For their fish shall be according to their kind, as the fish of the
great sea, exceeding many: that is, there shall be fish of all sorts,
small and great, and in large numbers, as in the great ocean, or as in
the Mediterranean sea. These signify regenerated persons, who are born
of water and the Spirit by the word of God, which is their element; they
cannot live but in these waters of the sanctuary, and where the
doctrines of grace are preached. Now many of all nations, and men of all
ranks, will be called; kings, princes, nobles, as well as peasants; men
high and low, rich and poor, and multitudes of them, like the fishes of
the sea; which will be the case when the Jews will be converted, and the
fulness of the Gentiles brought in.

But the miry places thereof, and the marshes thereof,.... That is, of
the sea; the waters of which were healed, by the waters of the sanctuary
coming into them: but the ditches and lakes, the miry and marsh ground,
separate from the sea, which lay near it, and upon the borders of it,

shall not be healed; these design the reprobate part of the world,
obstinate and perverse sinners, that abandon themselves to their filthy
lusts, and sensual pleasures; that wallow like swine in the mire and
dirt of sin; are wholly immersed in the things of this world, mind
nothing but earth and earthly things, and load themselves with thick
clay; whose god is their belly, and who glory in their shame: also
hypocrites and apostates may be here meant, who, despising the GospeL,
and the doctrines of it, put it away from them, and judge themselves
unworthy of everlasting life, and so receive no benefit by it; but, on
the contrary, it is the savour of death unto death unto them; see [Isa
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#009.md),

they shall be given to salt; left to the hardness of their hearts; given
up to the lusts of them; devoted to ruin and destruction and remain
barren and unfruitful, as places demolished and sown with salt are; see
[Deu 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#023.md), or made an example of, as
Lot's wife was; that others may learn wisdom, and shun those things that
have been the cause of their ruin. The Targum is,

"its pools and lakes shall not be healed; they shall be for salt pits.''

[Ezekiel 47:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 47:12</span></span>

And by the river on the banks thereof, on this side and on that
side,.... On each side of the river, on the banks of it:

shall grow all trees for meat; such as bear fruit, that may be eaten,
and is good for food: by these "trees" are meant truly gracious souls,
converted persons, real Christians, true believers in Christ; who like
trees have a root, are rooted in the love of God, in the person and
grace of Christ, and have the root of the matter in them, the grace of
the blessed Spirit; and who also is their sap, of which they are full,
and so grow in grace, and in the knowledge of Christ; grow up in him,
and grow upwards and heavenwards in their affections and desires, and in
the exercise of faith and hope: they are the trees of the Lord, trees of
righteousness, good trees, that bring forth good fruit; and are often in
Scripture compared to trees the most excellent, as palm trees, cedars,
olives, myrtles, &c. and wherever the Gospel comes, these trees arise,
and are watered and made fruitful by it; sometimes in lesser, and
sometimes in greater numbers, as in the first times of the Gospel, and
as they will in the latter day; see [Psa
92:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#012.md),

whose leaf shall not fade; as the leaves of trees in autumn do, and drop
off and fall; to which some professors of religion are compared, who
bear no fruit, only have the leaves of a profession, and this they drop
when any trouble or difficulty arises, [Jde
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#012.md), but true believers, as they take
up a profession on principles of grace, they hold it fast without
wavering; their root, seed, and sap, remain, and so never wither and die
in their profession; see [Psa 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003.md),

neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed; which are the graces of the
Spirit, and good works flowing from them: the graces of the Spirit are
abiding ones, as faith, hope, and love; these never die, are an
incorruptible seed, a well of water springing up unto everlasting life;
and good works, which are fruits meet for repentance, and evidences of
faith, and by which trees are known to be good, always continue to be
wrought by believers, in the strength and grace of Christ, from whom
they have all their fruits of every kind, [Hos
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#008.md),

it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months; or, "first
fruits" (o); that is, everyone of these trees, or every true believer,
shall be continually in the exercise of grace, and the performance of
duty; they shall be constant and immovable, always abounding in the work
of the Lord; they shall never cease from yielding fruit, or doing good;
they shall still bring it even in old age; see [Psa
92:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#014.md),

because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary; because the
waters, which issued out of the sanctuary, ran by these trees, and
watered them, and made them fruitful, and therefore called their waters:
the fruitfulness of these trees, true believers, is not owing to
themselves, to their free will and power; to their own industry,
diligence, and cultivation; but to the supplies of grace they receive by
means of the Gospel, and the doctrines of it; which bring forth, or
cause to bring forth fruit, wherever they come with power, [Col
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#006.md),

and the fruit thereof shall be for meat; not for saints themselves, who
live not, neither on their graces, nor their works; though indeed they
do eat the fruits of their doings, [Isa
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#010.md), that is, enjoy good things,
consequent on their works, through the free favour and good will of God;
but for meat for others; for their fruit, which appears in their words
and actions, are very beneficent to others; their fruit is a tree of
life, [Pro 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#030.md) and their lips feed
many, [Pro 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#021.md), with knowledge and
understanding; with the Gospel, and the doctrines of it; and with the
comfortable experience they have of its truths and promises: yea, their
fruit are meat and food for Christ himself; who comes into his garden,
and eats his pleasant fruits, feeds and feasts, and delights himself
with his own grace in his people, and the exercise of it, [Sol
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#009.md),

and the leaf thereof for medicine; or, "for bruises" (p); for the
healing of them, which is only done by the blood of Christ; who is the
only physician, the sun of righteousness, that rises with healing or
pardon in his wings; and the whole language of this passage is borrowed
from hence by John, and applied to Christ the tree of life, [Rev
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#002.md) and the Gospel professed by true
believers directs to him for healing, or for the remission of sin, and
is the means of applying it, [Psa
107:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#020.md) and a cheerful constant
profession of Christ and his Gospel, which is the Christian's leaf, does
good like a medicine, both to the Christian himself, and to others; who
are animated and encouraged thereby to go on with pleasure in the ways
of God.

[Ezekiel 47:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 47:13</span></span>

Thus saith the Lord God, this shall be the border,.... Of the land of
Israel, as described in the following verses; which being different
from, and much larger, and more extensive, than it was in the times of
Moses or Joshua, or than it was either before or after the captivity in
Babylon, shows that this must be understood either of the land of
Canaan, as it will be when possessed and inhabited by the Jews, upon
their conversion in the latter day; or rather of the church of Christ,
which is far greater than it was under the former dispensation; and
especially it will be still more extensive hereafter, when Christ's
kingdom will be from sea to sea, and his dominion from the river to the
ends of the earth; and from the rising of the sun to the setting of the
same, his name shall be great among the Gentiles. This subject is
reassumed from [Eze 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#001.md) after the
insertion of various things of moment and importance there, a reserve
upon the division of the land is made of a holy portion of it, for the
sanctuary; for the priests, the ministers of it; for the Levites, the
ministers of the house; and for a possession of the city, and of the
prince; and the rest to be given to the house of Israel, the boundaries
of which, are here fixed:

whereby ye shall inherit the land, according to the twelve tribes of
Israel; by which are meant, not literal Israel, or according to the
flesh, these being not all Israel, or the children of God, and so not
heirs, and shall not inherit; but spiritual Israel, or the special
people of God, that shall dwell in the church, and enjoy all the
privileges of it; these are the sealed ones of all the tribes of Israel,
an equal number out of each tribe; see [Rev
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#004.md). Joseph shall have two "portions"
for his two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, and in virtue of the birthright
which fell to him on the forfeiture of it by Reuben; he was an eminent
type of Christ, with whom the saints are joint heirs; and who has two
portions, one for himself as Mediator, and another for them.

[Ezekiel 47:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 47:14</span></span>

And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another,.... That is, the twelve
tribes shall equally inherit it; one tribe shall not have more, and
another less, but each alike: this was not the case, at the division of
the land, in the times of Moses and Joshua; for to such tribes as were
very numerous a greater inheritance was given; and to those that were
fewer in number a lesser inheritance, [Num
26:54](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#054.md), and upon the return from the
Babylonish captivity, as the tribes of Judah and Benjamin were the
largest, and indeed the only tribes that returned as such, they had the
share of the land; but as this respects the dispensation, it signifies,
that those who are true Israelites indeed shall share in the same Gospel
church state, the privileges and immunities of it alike, with all the
blessings of grace and eternal glory; they being all one in Christ
Jesus, [Gal 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#028.md),

concerning the which I lifted up my hand to give it unto your fathers;
that is, swore that he would give unto them the land of Canaan; typical
of the Gospel church state and the heavenly glory; which are as sure to
all the seed, by the word and oath of God, as that was:

and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance; by lot, by the
appointment of God, and a goodly one it is, [Psa
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#006.md).

[Ezekiel 47:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 47:15</span></span>

And this shall be the border of the land toward the north side,.... The
description of the borders of the land begins on the north side; because
the Gospel, and the interest of Christ, would be, as they now are,
chiefly in the northern part of the world, before the latter day glory
takes place, and from thence spread into the other parts of it:

from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as men go to Zedad; the line of
this border shall begin at the Mediterranean sea, commonly called the
great sea, and so proceed to Hethlon, a city in Syria Damascene, and
from thence to Zedad; of which see [Num
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#008.md), the description is taken all
along from the places which were on the border of Canaan, or in
countries adjacent to it, which plainly point out the enlargement of it.

[Ezekiel 47:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 47:16</span></span>

Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim,.... The line of the northern border should be
drawn on by Hamath, the same with Antiochia in Syria, since called
Epiphania, as Jerom observes, from Antiochus Epiphanies; and go on by
Berothah, a city of Hadadezer king of Zobah, [Sa2
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#008.md), the same with the Barothena of
Ptolemy (q), placed by him in Syria; and from thence the line would be
carried on to Sibraim, a city in Arabia Deserta:

which is between the border of Damascus; the chief city in Syria: and
the border of Hamath; before mentioned. Calmet (r) imagines it to be
that which Ishmael Abulfeda calls Hovvarin; which he says is a village
of the country of Ems or Hamath, to the southeast of the city.

Hazarhatticon, which is by the coast of Hauran; this seems to be
explanative of Sibraim, which lay between the border of Damascus and the
border of Hamath; and therefore is called the middle town or village, as
"Hazarhatticon" signifies; and lay by the coast of Hauran, which Jerom
calls a town of Damascus, with which it is mentioned, [Eze
47:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#018.md), from whence the country
adjacent is called Auranitis, as this place is here by the Septuagint.
The Targum calls Hazar the fish pool of the Agbeans; but for what
reason, and what is meant by it, I know not.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 47:17</span></span>

And the border from the sea shall be Hazarenan, the border of
Damascus,.... Which was the furthermost part and end of the northern
border, as fixed by Moses, [Num 34:9](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#009.md),

and the north northward, and the border of Hamath; if this is carrying
on the border further, it seems to be another Hamath, distinct from the
former, [Eze 47:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#016.md),

and this is the north side: of the land, and the description of the
northern border of it, from the Mediterranean sea to Hazarenan.

[Ezekiel 47:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 47:18</span></span>

And the east side ye shall measure Hauran,.... The line of the eastern
border of the land shall begin at Hauran or Auranitis; see [Eze
47:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#016), which lay to the south (s.md) of
Damascus: and it follows,

and from the land of Israel by Jordan, from the border unto the east
sea; and so from Damascus, the metropolis of Syria; and likewise from
Gilead, a mountain and country beyond Jordan; and also from that part of
the land of Israel near to Jordan; and so from the northern border to
the east sea, or sea of Galilee or Tiberias:

and this is the east side: of the land, or the eastern border of it,
reaching from Hauran to the lake of Gennesaret, or to the Salt sea, the
sea of Sodom; see [Num 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#010.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 47:19</span></span>

And the south side southward from Tamar,.... Not Jericho, as the Targum,
Jarchi, and Kimchi, called by this name from the palm trees which grew
near it; according to Jerom, this is Palmyra, so called for the same
reason; but it is rather Engedi, called Hazazontamar, [Ch2
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#002.md), the line of the southern border
began here, and went on,

even to the waters of strife in Kadesh; to the waters of Meribah in
Kadesh; so called, from the strivings of the children of Israel with the
Lord there, [Num 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#001.md),

the river to the great sea; it proceeded by the river of Egypt, the
river Sihor, the Nile, which is before Egypt, [Jos
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#003.md) and so on to the Mediterranean
sea:

and this is the south side southward; the south side of the land, and
the southern border of it.

[Ezekiel 47:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 47:20</span></span>

The west side also shall be the great sea from the border,.... From the
border of Egypt, and the river of it, to the Mediterranean sea, is the
west side of the land, and the western border of it; hence the western
point is often expressed in Scripture by the sea:

till a man come over against Hamath; Antioch in Syria; see [Eze
47:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#016.md).

this is the west side; of the land, and of the western border of it.

[Ezekiel 47:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 47:21</span></span>

So shall ye divide this land unto you,.... As thus bounded, east, west,
north, and south:

according to the tribes of Israel; See Gill on [Eze
47:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#013.md).

[Ezekiel 47:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 47:22</span></span>

And it shall come to pass,.... In the last days, under the Gospel
dispensation:

that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you; who were
Israelites, both by natural descent, and by the Spirit and grace of God:
the Gospel was first preached to Israel after the flesh, and made
effectual to the conversion of many of them; and the first churches were
made up of them, and they shared all the blessings and privileges
thereof; as they also will in the latter day, when converted:

and to the strangers that sojourn among them; not such as were strangers
to spiritual and divine things; for this would contradict the rule in
[Eze 44:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#009.md), but converted Gentiles, so
called because of their natural descent and civil state, being, with
respect to both, aliens from the commonwealth of Israel; yet were to be,
as they have been, and will be, taken into the same Gospel church state
with the believing Jews:

which shall beget children among you; not only in a natural, but in a
spiritual sense; be the means of begetting many souls again to the
lively hope of a glorious inheritance:

and they shall be unto you as born in the country among the children of
Israel; that is, the children begotten by the Gentiles shall be
considered all one as those of the children of Israel, being born again
of the same Spirit and grace; and so have an equal right to the same
privileges, and to which they shall be admitted:

they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel; this is
a new thing, and what in a literal sense was never granted; for though
in the times of Moses and onward, and by his direction from the Lord,
such as have been called proselytes of the gate, and proselytes of
righteousness, have been admitted to various privileges, by conforming
to certain rules, rites, and ceremonies, yet never were allowed to have
any inheritance in the land; and, after the captivity, Ezra and Nehemiah
drove out the strangers, who by affinity with some had got among them:
but this respects Gospel times, and the coalition of Jews and Gentiles
in the same church state; where there is no difference, but Christ is
all in all; where they are admitted to the same ordinances of baptism
and the Lord's supper; partake of the same blessings of grace, and
promises of the word, and have an equal right to the heavenly
inheritance: [Eph 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#006.md), is the best
commentary on this passage; which contains the same mystery the Apostle
Paul was acquainted with,

that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and
partakers of his promise in Christ by the Gospel; See Gill on [Eph
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#006.md). See [Eph
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012.md).

[Ezekiel 47:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 47:23</span></span>

And it shall come to pass, that in what tribe the stranger
sojourneth,.... Whatsoever particular congregation or church these
strangers and sojourners (as all the Lord's people are in this world,
and even in their church state), or those Gentiles before described,
shall be nearest unto, and to which they shall propose themselves for
communion, they shall be readily admitted:

there shall ye give him his inheritance, saith the Lord God; allow him a
name and a place; put him in the possession of all church privileges and
immunities; look upon him as a member, a brother, a fellow citizen, as
an heir together of the grace of life, and as equally entitled to the
inheritance of the saints in light; and for this they have the authority
and order of Jehovah himself.
