INTRODUCTION TO NEHEMIAH

This book is, by the authors of the Vulgate Latin and Arabic versions,
called the "Second" Book of Ezra, it being a continuation of the same
history, and was by the Jews reckoned as one book with Ezra; Kimchi on
[Isa 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007.md), calls it Ezra, so the Talmud
(a); and it has been quoted by Christian writers under his name; see the
argument of the book of Ezra; but not as if it was written by him; for
it is a clear case it was written by Nehemiah, whose name it bears, as
appears from [Neh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001.md) and throughout
Nehemiah speaks of himself under the first person; and the style also is
very different from that of Ezra, being plainer and easier than his. It
has always had a place in the canon of Scriptures, both with Jews and
Christians; and is of use to show the fulfilment of the prophecy of
Zechariah, and especially of Daniel concerning the building of the wall
of Jerusalem in troublesome times; to carry on the history of the Jews,
and describe the state of the church in those times, what opposition was
made to it, and what enemies it had, and what must be expected when any
work of God is set about; it is the last of the historical books that
was written, as is thought, and contains an history of the space of
about twelve years, from the twentieth of Artaxerxes to the thirty
second of his reign, see [Neh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001.md).
