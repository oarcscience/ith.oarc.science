INTRODUCTION TO JUDE

That this epistle was written by Jude, one of the twelve apostles of
Christ, and not by Jude the fifteenth bishop of Jerusalem, who lived in
the time of Trojan, a little before Bar Cocab, the false Messiah, as
Grotius thought, is evident from his being called, in the epistle
itself, the brother of James, and which is confirmed by all copies; and
its agreement with the second epistle of Peter shows it to have been
written about the same time, and upon the same occasion. As to Jude's
not calling himself an apostle, but a servant of Jesus Christ, it may be
observed, that the latter is much the same with the former, and the
Apostle Paul sometimes uses them both, as in [Rom
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md), [Tit
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#001.md), and sometimes neither, as [Th1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001.md), and sometimes only servant, as
Jude does here, Php 1:1, though in some copies of the title of this
epistle he is called "Jude the Apostle"; and as to Jude's making mention
of the apostles as if he was later than they, and not of their number,
[Jde 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#017.md), it may be returned for
answer to it, that the Apostle Peter expresses himself much in the same
manner, [Pe2 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#002.md), where some copies,
instead of "us the apostles", read "your apostles", [Pe2
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#002.md); moreover, Jude seems to cite a
passage out of Peter, as Peter in the same chapter cites the Apostle
Paul, which only shows agreement in their doctrine and writing; and at
most it only follows from hence, that Jude wrote after some of the
apostles, as Paul and Peter, who had foretold there would be mockers in
the last time; and that Jude had lived to be a witness of the truth of
what they had said; nor does he exclude himself from their number. And
that this epistle is a genuine one appears from the majesty of its
style, the truth of doctrine contained in it, and its agreement with the
second epistle of Peter, and from the early reception of it in the
churches. Eusebius (a) says, it was reckoned among the seven catholic
epistles, and was published in most churches; though he observes, that
many of the ancients make no mention of it: but certain it is, that
several of the ancient writers before him do make mention of it, and
cite it as genuine, as Clemens Alexandrinus (b), Tertullian (c), and
Origen (d): and as for the prophecy of Enoch, cited in this epistle, it
is not taken out of an apocryphal book, that bears that name, for the
apostle makes no mention of any writing of his, but of a prophecy; and
had he cited it out of that book, as it was truth, it can no more
prejudice the authority of this epistle, than the citations made by the
Apostle Paul out of the Heathen poets can affect his epistles: and
whereas there is an account also given in this epistle of a dispute
about the body of Moses, nowhere else to be met with, supposing it to be
understood of his real body, of which [Jde
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#009.md); this can be no more an objection
to the genuineness of this epistle, than the mention of Jannes and
Jambres, who withstood Moses, by the Apostle Paul, [Ti2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#008.md), is an objection to an epistle of
his, whose names are not to be met with in other parts of Scripture; but
were what were known by tradition, as might be the case here. The
epistle is called "catholic", or "general", because it is not written to
any particular person or church, but to the saints in general, and it
may be to the same persons that Peter wrote his; see [Pe1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001.md), and who seem to be chiefly the
believing Jews; see [Jde 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#005.md), though
the Syriac version of [Jde 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#001.md) reads,
"Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ"--ammel, "to the nations", or
"Gentiles, called", &c. the design of the epistle to both is to exhort
them to continue in the faith, and contend for it; and to describe false
teachers, to point out their principles, practices, and dreadful end,
that so they might shun and avoid them.
