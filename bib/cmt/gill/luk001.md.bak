### [Luke Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md)

[Luke 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 1:1</span></span>

Forasmuch as many have taken in hand,.... From hence, to the end of [Luk
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#004.md) is a preface of the evangelist to
his Gospel, setting forth the reasons of his writing it; and which he
wrote and sent to the excellent Theophilus, for the further confirmation
of him in the faith of Christ. It seems that many had took in hand, or
attempteo set forth in order a declaration of those things which are
most surely believed among us; that is, they undertook to write and
publish a very particular and exact narrative of the birth, life,
actions, doctrines, miracles, sufferings, death, resurrection, and
ascension of Jesus Christ; things which Luke, and other Christians, had
the fullest and strongest evidence, and were confidently assured of, and
most firmly believed, even with a full assurance of faith. By these
many, he cannot mean the authentic historians of evangelical facts, as
Matthew and Mark; for they two cannot, with any propriety, be called
many; and besides, it is not so very clear and certain a point, that
they had, as yet, wrote their Gospels; nor would this evangelist suggest
any deficiency, weakness, and inaccuracy in them, as he seems to do: nor
does he intend such spurious writers as the authors of the Gospels
according to the Nazarenes, Hebrews, and Egyptians; of Nicodemus,
Thomas, Matthias, and of the twelve apostles; and still less, the
Gospels of Cerinthus, Basilides, and other heretics; since these would
not have passed without a censure from him, for the falsehood, fabulous,
and trifling stuff in them, as well as for the wicked and heretical
opinions propagated by them; and besides, these pieces were not extant
when this Gospel was written: but he seems to design some honest and
well meaning Christians, who undertook to write, and did write an
account of the above things, which were firmly believed by all; and
which they took from the apostles, and first ministers of the Gospel,
from their sermons and discourses, and from conversation with them; and
which they committed to writing, partly to help their own memories, and
partly for the benefit of others; in which, no doubt, they acted an
upright part, though attended with weakness: wherefore, the evangelist
does not censure them as false, wicked, and heretical, nor approve of
them as divine and perfect for though they honestly meant, and designed
well, yet there might be many things collected by them, which were
impertinent, and not proper to be transmitted to posterity; and what
might be wrote with great inaccuracy and deficiency, and in a style the
Holy Ghost thought improper things of this kind should be delivered in:
and therefore the evangelist, moved and inspired by the Spirit of God,
set about the following work, and under the same influence completed it.
The phrase, , "to set forth in order a declaration", is as Dr. Lightfoot
observes, out of the Talmud (h), agreeably to the Jewish way of
speaking,

"R. Chasdai said to one of the Rabbins, who was , "setting in order a
declaration" before him. &c. or relating in order a story before him.

[Luke 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 1:2</span></span>

Even as they delivered them unto us,.... By whom the evangelist means,
as appears from the after description of them, the twelve apostles, and
seventy disciples; who handed down to others the accounts of the birth,
life, and death of Christ; and according to which the above Christians
proposed to write:

which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word;
either of the Gospel, or rather of Christ himself, the eternal Word of
God; for from the beginning of Christ's preaching the Gospel, or as soon
as he entered upon his public ministry, he called his apostles, as
Simon, Andrew, James, John, &c. and afterwards seventy disciples; who
were eyewitnesses of him, of the truth of his incarnation, and of his
ministry and miracles; saw, and conversed with him after his
resurrection from the dead and beheld his ascension to heaven; and were
ministers that were called, qualified, and sent out by him and waited on
him, and served him. This shows, as is by some rightly observed, that
Luke was not one of the seventy disciples, as some (i) have thought, and
as the title of this Gospel, to the Arabic version of it, expresses; for
then he would have been an eyewitness himself: nor did he take his
account from the Apostle Paul; for he was not a minister of the word
from the beginning, but was as one born out of due time,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 1:3</span></span>

It seemed good to me also,.... Being moved to it by the Holy Ghost; for
he did not undertake this work of himself, merely by the motion of his
own will, but was influenced, and directed to it by the Spirit of God,
as well as by him assisted in it:

having had perfect understanding of all things; relating to the subject
of this Gospel, concerning the conception, birth, ministry, baptism, and
death of John the Baptist; concerning the conception, birth, private and
public life of Christ, together with his sufferings, death,
resurrection, and ascension. The Syriac and Persic versions refer the
word "all" to persons, to the eyewitnesses and ministers of the word;
rendering the clause thus, "who have been studiously near to them all":
and both senses may be taken in, and the meaning be, that Luke had
diligently sought after, and had attained unto a perfect knowledge of
all the affairs of Christ; having studiously got into the company of,
and intimately conversed with all, or as many as he could, who had seen
Christ in the flesh; and were, from the very first of his ministry,
attendants on him, that he might have the most certain and exquisite
account of things, that could be come at:

from the very first; and to the last; from the conception of John, the
forerunner of the Messiah, which is higher than any other evangelist
goes, to the ascension of Christ; though some choose to render the word
here used, "from above", as it may be, and sometimes is; and may
signify, that the evangelist had his perfect knowledge of things by a
revelation from above, by divine inspiration; and this moved him to
write, and which he mentions, that Theophilus, to whom he writes, and
every other reader, may depend, with certainty, on what is said in it.
This clause is omitted in the Syriac, Arabic, and Persic versions, but
is in all copies, and by all means to be retained: this being the case,
these reasons prevailed upon him, as he says,

to write unto thee, in order, most excellent Theophilus; which regards
not so much the order of time, which he does not always strictly
observe, as the particulars of things, related in order, and with great
exactness: who this Theophilus was, to whom he writes his Gospel, cannot
be said; by his title, which is such as was given to governors of
provinces, as to Felix and Festus, [Act
23:26](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#026.md), he seems to be, or to have
been, a civil magistrate in some high office; for though not many rich,
and mighty, yet some have been, and are, called by grace. Theophylact
(k) says, he was of the order of the senators, and perhaps a nobleman,
or prince: however, this name was not a general name, for every "lover
of God", as the word signifies, as Salvian (l) thought; but the name of
a particular man, who believed in Christ, and was an acquaintance of
Luke's; though Epiphanius (m) makes a doubt of it which it should be,

[Luke 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 1:4</span></span>

That thou mightest know the certainty,.... The end the evangelist had in
writing this Gospel, and sending it to Theophilus, was, that he might be
more strongly assured of and more firmly established in the truths of
the Gospel. The Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic versions render it,
"that thou mightest know the truth"; that is, the certain truth of
things: the truth he did in some measure know before, but Luke's view
was, that he might have a more certain knowledge of it; both truth, and
the certainty of it may be intended: so the Hebrew word, signifies both
truth and firmness; and the word here used signifies such a certain
evidence of things, as may be safely depended on; even

of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed; or catechised,
signifying, that he had been hitherto taught, as a catechumen, the
rudiments, and first principles of the Christian religion, by word of
mouth; and he had taken them in upon the evidence they came with, and
the authority of those that instructed him in them; and now he sent him
in writing this account, to increase his knowledge, strengthen his
faith, and to give him such a sure proof of things, as might preserve
him safe in the belief of them, from all doubting and defection. Having
finished his preface, he proceeds to the narrative itself, which begins
as follows.

[Luke 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 1:5</span></span>

There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea,.... This was Herod,
the son of Antipater, sometimes called Herod the Great, and is rightly
here said to be the king of Judea; for, by deputation from the Roman
emperor, he had the government of all Judea, which upon his death was
divided among his sons. The phrase, "in the days of", is an eastern way,
of speaking; see [Gen 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#001.md); and
intends the time of his reign; in which there was

a certain priest named Zacharias: a name famous among the Jews, for an
high priest, who was slain by them the court of the temple, [Ch2
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#020.md), and for one of the later
prophets, [Zac 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001.md), who were of this
name. This man, the father of John the Baptist, was not an high priest,
as this character of him, and the work afterwards ascribed to him, show;
though he has been thought to be so by some; and John himself is so
called by the Jews (n): he was

of the course of Abia. The Ethiopic version reads, "in the days of
Abia": and it has been the opinion of some, that Zacharias and Abia were
two priests, who performed their ministry in succession, one after
another; one ministered one time, and another at another time; but such
betray their ignorance both of Scripture, and of Jewish affairs. In
David's time, there was a division of the sons of Aaron into "twenty
four" orders, or courses; and this of Abia was one, and the "eighth" of
them; see [Ch1 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#001.md). The account the
Jews (o) give of this matter, and in which they are not agreed, is this,

"says Rab Chama bar Guria, says Rab, Moses ordered for the Israelites
eight courses, four from Eleazar, and four from Ithamar; Samuel came and
made them "sixteen"; David came and made them twenty four.--It is a
tradition, that Moses ordered for the Israelites sixteen courses, eight
from Eleazar, and eight from Ithamar; and when the children of Eleazar
increased above the children of Ithamar, they divided them, and
appointed them twenty four.

The account, as given by Maimonides (p), is as follows:

"Moses, our master, divided the priests into eight courses, four from
Eleazar, and four from Ithamar, and so they were until Samuel the
prophet; and in the days of Samuel, he and David, the king, divided them
into twenty four courses; and over every course one head was appointed,
and they went up to Jerusalem to the service of the course every week;
and from sabbath to sabbath they changed; one course went out, and
another came in, till they finished, and returned again.

Now of these there were but four courses returned from the Babylonish
captivity, as appears from [Ezr 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#036.md)
and with this the Jewish accounts agree (q),

"The Rabbins teach, that four courses came up from the captivity,
Jedaiah, Harim, Pashur, and Immer; the prophets that were among them
stood up, and divided them, and appointed four and twenty lots, and put
them into a box: Jedaiah came and took his lot, and the lot of his
companions, six; Harim came and took his lot, and the lot of his
companions, six; and so Pashur and Immer: and so the prophets that were
among them taught, that if Jehoiarib, the first course, came up from
captivity, he should not drive away Jedaiah out of his place; but
Jedaiah should be the principal, and Jehoiarib an appendix to him.

Now, though the course of Abia did not return from captivity, yet its
order and name were retained as the rest of the courses, being divided
between these four by whom they were supplied; and therefore Zacharias
is not said to be of the posterity of Abia, but of his course. To these
courses there were added as many stations; and what they were, and their
use, may be learnt from what follows (r),

"The former prophets offered four and twenty courses; and to every
course there was a station at Jerusalem; consisting of priests, Levites,
and Israelites: and when the time came for the course to go up, the
priests and Levites went up to Jerusalem, but the Israelites, which were
in that course, gathered themselves to their cities, and read in the
history of the creation; and the men of the station fasted four days in
the week, from the second day, to the fifth.

The sense of which, according to their commentators (s), is, that these
stations were substituted in the room of, and represented all Israel;
and their business was to give themselves up to divine worship, prayer,
and sacrifices; and such of them as were near Jerusalem, when the time
of their course came, assisted at the sacrifices; and such as were afar
off, betook themselves to the synagogues in their cities, and there
fasted, prayed, and read. And so another of their authors (t) says,

"there were twenty and four courses of the priests, and so twenty and
four courses of the Levites; and every week the course of the priests
and Levites goes to Jerusalem; and the twenty and four stationary men,
half of them go thither, and half are left in their houses, and pray
over the offerings:

for they had their stationary cities, where these men dwelt (u). Jericho
was one: they say (w),

"Jericho was able to produce a complete station itself; but because of
dividing the glory to Jerusalem, it furnished out but half an one:

hence you need not wonder to hear of a priest and Levite on the road to
Jericho from Jerusalem, as in [Luk
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#031.md) for they say, in the same place,
that twenty four thousand, a station consisted of at Jerusalem, and
there was half a station at Jericho: as for the heads of the courses of
the houses of their fathers,

"there were in a course five, six, seven, eight, nine of them; a course
which had five (heads) in it, three offered three days, and two offered
four days; a course in which were six, five offered five days, and one
offered two days: a course in which were seven, every one offered on his
day; a course in which were eight, six offered six days, and two offered
one day; a course in which were nine, live offered five days, and four
offered two days: and there were some that fixed themselves for ever;
and a course that was (or began) on a sabbath day, was always on a
sabbath; and that which was at the going out of the sabbath, was always
at the going out of the sabbath: and there were some of them that
offered at every course: and there were some that cast lots at every
course (x).

But to say no more of these courses and stations, I conclude with what
Maimonides (y) says of them:

"it is not possible, that a man's offering should be offered up, and he
not stand by it; but the offerings of the congregation are the offerings
of all Israel; and it is not possible that all Israel should stand, in
the court at the time of sacrifice: wherefore the former prophets
ordered, that they should chose out of Israel men that were fit, and
feared to sin, that they may be the messengers of all Israel to stand by
the offerings, and these are called the men of the station; and they
divided them into twenty and four stations, according to the number of
the courses of the priests and Levites; and at every station one of them
was appointed over them all, and he called the head of the station; and
every week the men of the station of that week gather together; and such
of them as are in Jerusalem, or near to it, go into the temple, with the
course of the priests and Levites of that week; and they who are in that
station, that are at a distance, when their station comes, they gather
together to the synagogue, which is in their place.

Then he goes on to give an account, as before, how often they fast in
that week, how many prayers they say, and what they read,

And his wife was of the daughters of Aaron. It is a saying of R.
Jochanan (z),

"he that would be rich, let him join himself to the seed of Aaron; so it
is, that the law and the priesthood make rich.--R. Idi bar Abin married
a priestess, and from him proceeded that were made doctors, R. Shesheth,
the son of R. Idi, and R. Joshua, the son of R. Idi.

This is not so much said in commendation of Zacharias, that he took a
wife of the same tribe, and of the priestly line: for it was lawful for
the tribe of Levi to take a wife of any other, because it did not make
any alteration in the inheritances of tribes; and it a rule with the
Jews (a), that priests, Levites, and Israelites, might marry with one
another; as Mary, who was of the tribe of Judah, was akin to Elizabeth:
but to point the original of John, and show of what extraction he was,
his father and mother being both of the family of Aaron,

And her name was Elizabeth; the same name with "Elisheba", the wife of
Aaron, [Exo 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#023.md), and whom the
Septuagint interpreters there call, as here, Elisabeth: and this being
the name of Aaron's wife, it is very probable it might be a common name
among the daughters of Aaron, in succeeding generations,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 1:6</span></span>

And they were both righteous before God,.... Not as the Pharisees, only
righteous before men, but in the sight of God, who sees the heart, and
whose judgment is according to truth; and therefore were not justified
by the deeds of the law; for by them no man can be justified in the
sight of God; but were made righteous through the righteousness of
Christ, by which the saints were made righteous before the coming of
Christ, as those after it: see [Act
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#011.md). God beheld them in his Son, as
clothed with that righteousness he engaged to bring in, and as cleansed
from all sin in that blood of his which was to be shed: and they
appeared to him, and in the eye of his justice, and according to his
law, righteous persons: though this character may also regard the
internal holiness of their hearts, and the truth and sincerity of grace
in them: which God, who trieth the hearts and reins of the children of
men, knew, took notice of, and bore testimony to: as likewise their
holy, upright walk and conversation before men, and which was observed
by God, and acceptable to him, though imperfect, as arising from a
principle of grace, being performed in the faith and fear of him, and
with a view to his glory, and for the sake, and through the
righteousness of his Son,

Walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord: this was not
the matter of their righteousness before God, but the evidence of it
before men: "by the commandments" are meant, all those that are of a
moral nature, which regarded their duty to God and man, and which are
comprehended in love to both; and by "the ordinances of the Lord", are
intended the injunctions and institutions of the ceremonial law, which
is called the law of commandments, contained in ordinances, which,
though now abolished, were then in force: and it was right and
commendable in them to observe them, who, by their "walking" in them,
showed they loved them, both one and the other; esteemed them,
concerning all things to be right; and had respect to them all, and
observed them, and took pleasure in walking in them, which, by the grace
of God, they continued to do; for walking not only shows that these
commands and ordinances were a way marked out for them, but in which
they took pleasure, and made progress: and were

blameless; not that they were without sin, as none are; and it appears
from this chapter that Zacharias was not, see [Luk
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#020.md) but they were so in the sight of
God; as they were justified by the righteousness of Christ, so they were
without fault before the throne, and unreproveable before God; and as to
their moral and religious character and conduct before men, they did not
indulge themselves in any known sin, but lived in all good conscience
among men: nor were they remiss and negligent in the discharge of duty:
they were not guilty of any notorious breach of the law of God, or of
any remarkable negligence in the business of religious observances: and
though they might observe enough in them to charge themselves with, and
to humble themselves before God and men; yet so strict were they, in
their lives and conversations, that those who were the most intimately
acquainted with them, had nothing very material to blame them for.

[Luke 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 1:7</span></span>

And they had no child,.... Son or daughter: and which was accounted a
great infelicity: but this was not owing to the judgment of God upon
them for any sins they had been guilty of, as the above character of
them shows: and it had been the case of some righteous pairs before them
for a great while, as Abraham and Sarah, Manoah, and his wile, Elkanah
and Hannah:

because that Elizabeth was barren; so that it was peculiarly her case,
and not Zacharias's: and though God had promised the people of Israel
that there should be no male nor female barren among them, [Deu
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#014.md) yet there were instances and
exceptions to this general rule, as before mentioned, when it was the
pleasure of God to make himself known, and magnify his power in the
extraordinary conception and birth of any person; and therefore, though
barrenness was reckoned a reproach to a person, there was, in this case,
a particular hand of God, to answer a special purpose: the signs of
sterility are, according to the Jews (b), when a woman had not breasts
as other women have, her voice gross, so that it could not be discerned,
whether it was a man's or a woman's, &c,

and they both were now well stricken in years; which made the conception
and birth of John the more extraordinary, and even miraculous, and so
the belief of it the more difficult; see [Gen
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#017.md) It may be literally rendered,
"they had proceeded", or had far advanced "in their days": it is an
"Hebraism", and answers to, in [Gen
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#011.md) where the Septuagint render it
by the same phrase as here. The Mahometan writers Beidavi and
Jallallo'din say (c) that Zacharias was "ninety nine" years of age, and
his wife "eighty nine",

And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office,.... To
which he was called and ordained, even to offer gifts and sacrifices for
men; whilst he was in the way of his duty, when oftentimes God appears
to, and in favour of his people; whilst he was performing it,

before God; in the temple, where was the symbol of the divine presence,
before the altar of the Lord; and as having the fear of God before his
eyes; considering himself as in the sight of God, and doing his work
faithfully and sincerely:

in the order of his course; taking his turn in the order of the course
of Abia, to which he belonged; See Gill on [Luk
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#005.md).

[Luke 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 1:9</span></span>

According to the custom of the priest's office,.... In which, every man
took his part in the execution of it by lot; and which was not an
original settled law of God; but a custom, which, in process of time,
through the number of the priests, took place, and prevailed: the
occasion of it was this,

"at first, whoever would, might sweep the altar, or cleanse it----it
happened that two alike ran, and came up to the ascent of the altar, and
one thrust down the other, and he fell, and his leg was broke; and when
the sanhedrim saw that they came into danger, they ordered that they
should not cleanse the altar, but by lot (d).

And so likewise all other sorts of service were settled by lot:

his lot was to burn incense, when he went into the temple of the Lord;
where was the altar of incense, and which was burnt upon it morning and
evening; see [Exo 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#001.md), and was
typical of the continual intercession of Jesus Christ; and this part of
service was assigned him by lot. The priests used to cast lots, what
part they should take in the service of the temple, in the order of the
course, to which they belonged (e),

"There were four lots there, and this was the first lot (i.e. to cleanse
the altar); the second lot was, who should slay (the sacrifice,) who
should sprinkle (the blood), who should remove the ashes from the
innermost altar, who should cleanse the candlestick, who should bring
the members (or parts of the sacrifice) to the ascent of the
altar----the third lot was, ye new ones, to the incense come, and "cast
lots"; and the fourth, ye new ones, with the old ones, who shall bring
up the parts from the ascent of the altar to the altar.

And this was not only the case on the day of atonement, to which these
rules belong; but every day in the daily service and sacrifice, when the
same rules were observed, as appears from the rubric of the daily
sacrifice: (f).

"the president said unto them (the priests), come and cast lots who
shall slay, who shall sprinkle, who shall remove the ashes from the
innermost altar, who shall remove the ashes from the candlestick, who
shall bring up the parts to the ascent of the altar, &c.

Again, (g),

"he says to them, O ye new ones, to the incense come, and cast lots; and
they cast lots, and he is worthy, whom he accounts worthy--and he that
is accounted worthy of the incense, takes a vessel, and the vessel is
like to a large golden bushel, that holds three kabs, and a bowl in the
middle of it, full and heaped up with incense, with a cover, and a sort
of a linen cloth put over it.

And it is afterwards said (h),

"he that is worthy of the incense, takes the bowl out of the vessel, and
gives it to his friend, or he that is near to him; and if it is
scattered from it, in the midst of it, he puts it into his fist; and
they teach him, "saying", take care that thou dost not begin before thy
face, that thou art not burnt: when he begins, he spreads it and goes
out; and he that burns incense, may not do it, until the president says,
burn incense.

The account Maimonides gives (i) of this matter, is as follows,

"all the services that they do every day, they do, by lot; and how do
they do it? All the priests of the houses of the fathers, of the day, go
into the paved chamber, after the pillar of the morning has ascended,
and clothe themselves with the priestly garments; and the president who
is over the lots is with them, and they stand in a circle; and the
president takes a mitre from off the head of one of them, and goes round
with it, and the man from whom he begins to number, and they cast lots,
as has been explained----how do they cast lots? they stand in a circle,
and agree upon a number, eighty, a hundred, or a thousand, or whatsoever
number they may agree upon; and the president says to them, put out your
fingers, and they put out their fingers, one, or two; and if one puts
out three, they number him three; and they do not put out the thumb in
the sanctuary, because of deceivers; for the thumb is short, and easy to
be put out, and to bend; and he that puts out the thumb, they do not
number for him: and the president begins to number from the man that is
known, whose mitre he took off first, and he numbers by their fingers,
and returns in the round, until he has perfected the number they agreed
upon; and the man that completes the number with his finger, he is he
that goes out by the first lot to service: and why does he number the
number they agree upon, by their fingers that they put out, and does not
number them by the men themselves? Because it is forbidden to number
Israel, but by means of another thing; as it is said, [Sa1
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#004.md) "And numbered them in Telaim".
There were four lots they cast every day in the morning; the first lot;
was, who should cleanse the altar: they cast lots, and he was worthy
that was accounted worthy to cleanse it; and he sets the row in order,
and brings up the two pieces of wood to the altar, and he brings in the
censer full of fire, from the outer altar, to the golden altar, to burn
incense upon it: and the second lot, thirteen were worthy of it,
according to the order of their standing; how? the president says to
them, put out your fingers, and he numbers in the way that has been
explained; and he that goes out by the first lot, is he that slays the
daily sacrifice of the morning; and the second that stands by his side,
is he that receives the blood of the daily sacrifice, and sprinkles it;
and the third that is next to the second, receives the ashes from the
innermost altar, which is the altar of incense; and the fourth, that is
by his side, cleanses the candlestick, and trims the lamps; and the
fifth brings up the head of the daily sacrifice, and its leg to the
ascent of the altar: and the sixth brings up the two shoulders; and the
seventh brings up the extreme part of the backbone, and the other leg;
and the eighth brings up the breast and the gullet; and the ninth brings
up the two sides; and the tenth brings up the inwards; and the eleventh
brings up the fine flour, and the drink offerings; and the twelfth
brings up the things that were fried; and the thirteenth brings up the
wine of the drink offerings: the third lot, the president says to them,
"even" to all the men of the house of the father of that day, whoever
has never burnt incense, let him come and "cast lots"; and they gather
together to the president, and cast lots; and he that goes out by the
lot first, he is he that is worthy to burn incense; the fourth lot, they
all gather together, and cast lots to know who shall bring up the parts
from the ascent of the altar, to the altar; they cast lots, and he is
worthy who is accounted worthy: the daily evening sacrifice, they do not
cast another lot for it; but every priest that is worthy of any service
of the services of the morning, is worthy of the evening, except that of
the incense; for they cast another lot for that in the evening; and
every one may come, who has never burnt incense of the men of that house
of the fathers, and cast lots for it; but if they have all of them burnt
incense already, they all of them cast lots, in the morning, at the
third lot; and he that is worthy of it in the morning, burns incense in
the evening.

Hence it appears, that the burning of incense, as other parts of the
priest's service, was by lot; and that they were new priests, or such
who had never burnt incense, that cast lots for it: for it is a
tradition (k), that no man ever burnt incense twice; the reason assigned
for it is, because it makes a man rich; and therefore that every one
might partake of the blessing in their turns, new ones were called unto
it: whether Zacharias had ever burnt incense before, and whether he now
did it in the morning or evening, is not certain,

And the whole multitude of the people were praying without,.... In the
court of the Israelites, whilst Zacharias was in the holy place; though
not in the holy of holies, where only the high priest entered: it looks,
as Dr. Lightfoot conjectures, as if this was on a sabbath day, since
there was such a multitude of people together; for on the weekday, there
were only the priests and Levites of the course, and the stationary men,
which represented the Israelites, and some of the more devout sort of
the people; but here was the whole multitude of the people; or as the
Ethiopic version renders it, "all the people were in a full congregation
praying": prayer, was wont to be made at the time of incense; hence it
is compared to it, [Psa 141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002.md). And
hence it is, that Christ is said to offer up the prayers of all saints,
with his much incense, [Rev 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003.md).

in the time of incense: whether it was morning or evening, the people
were obliged to be at a distance, whilst that was burning; the Jewish
canons confirm this (i):

"in the time they burn the incense in the temple every day, , "they
separate all the people", from the temple, and from between the porch
and the altar; there is not a man there, till he comes out that burns
the incense.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 1:11</span></span>

And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord,.... Gabriel, as seem's
manifest from [Luk 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#019.md) the same angel
that had appeared to Daniel, about the time of the evening oblation,
near five hundred years before, and gave him an account of the time of
the Messiah's coming, [Dan 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#021.md). The
Jews sometimes speak of divine and wonderful appearances to their
priests, at such times, and in such places:

"it is a tradition that R. Ishmael ben Elishah should say, one time I
went in, , "to burn incense": and I saw Actariel (one of the names of
God with them) the Lord, the Lord of hosts, who was sitting on a throne,
high and lifted up. (m).

And so they say of Simeon the just, that there was always an appearance
when he went into the holy of holies; it is related thus (n):

"Simeon the just, ministered unto Israel in the high priesthood, forty
years; and in the last year, he said to them, I shall die this year:
they said to him, from whence dost thou know it? He replied to them,
every year that I have entered into the holy of holies, there was, ,
"one old man" clothed in white, and veiled in white, that went in with
me, and came out with me; and this year he went in with me, but did not
come out with me.

And according to Josephus (o), the high priest Hyrcanus received an
oracle, or answer from God, as he was offering incense; so that the Jews
ought not to discredit such an appearance to Zacharias:

standing on the right side of the altar of incense; of which, see [Exo
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#001.md) the situation of it, according to
the Jews, was this (p):

"the table (of showbread) was in the north, two cubits and a half
distant from the wall; and the candlestick was in the south, two cubits
and a half distant from the wall; and the altar (of incense) was in the
middle, and stood between them.

And to

"this agrees the account of Maimonides (q), who says, the candlestick
was on the south, on the left hand, as you go in; and the table of
shewbread on the right hand, and both of them on the side of the holy of
holies without; and the altar of incense was between them both without.

So that it was on the north side that the angel stood,

And when Zacharias saw him,.... The angel; he was troubled, and fear
fell upon him; for such appearances of angels were not now so common as
formerly: and when they were more usual, generally had such effects on
the minds, even of good men; see [Jdg
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#022.md).

[Luke 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 1:13</span></span>

But the angel said unto him, fear not, Zacharias,.... He calls him by
his name; for holy men are known to angels in person, and by name; to
whom they are ministering spirits, and for whose good they are
concerned; and bid him not be afraid, as the angel also said to the
women at Christ's sepulchre, [Mat 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#005.md)
for he saw by his countenance and gestures, that he was greatly
surprised and terrified at the sight of him:

for thy prayer is heard; which he had many years ago put up for a son;
for it cannot be thought that he had been now praying for one, being in
such an advanced age, and having for years past given up all hopes of
one, and was even unbelieving, when he was told by the angel he should
have one: prayer is sometimes immediately heard, and answered; and
sometimes an answer is deferred a long time, to try the faith and
patience of the saints, and to discover the more the wisdom, power, and
goodness of God: or this may have regard to his present prayer, one
branch of which might concern the coming of the Messiah, which was now
expecting, and therefore is told, that his prayer was heard; since the
angel that appeared to him, brought him the news of the conception and
birth of his forerunner:

and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son; who had been always
barren, and was called so, [Luk 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#007.md).

And thou shalt call his name John; in Hebrew, "Jochanan", and signifies
"gracious": a fit name for one that was filled with the gifts and graces
of the Spirit; and was the harbinger of the Messiah, who is full of
grace and truth; and the ushered in the Messiah's kingdom, which is a
dispensation of grace.

[Luke 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 1:14</span></span>

And thou shalt have joy and gladness,.... Not only because of his having
a son; but because this his son would be the prophet of the Highest;
would go before the Lord, and prepare his ways; give knowledge of
salvation to many, and light to them that were in darkness, and guide
their feet in the way of peace: all which, and more, he afterwards
expresses in his song, whereby this part of the angel's prediction had
its accomplishment:

and many shall rejoice at his birth; as the neighbours and cousins of
his parents did; see [Luk 1:58](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#058.md) and not
only they, but all others, who, afterwards had knowledge of him as
prophet, and as the forerunner of the Messiah.

[Luke 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 1:15</span></span>

For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord,.... Of Jehovah, the
Father; with whom, what is highly esteemed among men, is oftentimes an
abomination; and of the Lord Jesus Christ, before whom he was to go, and
who pronounced him a prophet, and more than a prophet, and even greater
than any born of women, [Mat 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#009.md) and
of the Lord, the Spirit, with whom he was filled from his mother's womb:
he was great, not in birth and blood, in worldly riches and grandeur,
but in gifts and grace, in his work, office, and usefulness, and in the
esteem of God, and even of men too:

and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; which were forbidden the
Nazarites, [Num 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#003.md) where the Jews, by
"wine", understand "new wine"; and by "strong drink", old wine: so all
the "three Targums", of Onkelos, Jonathan ben Uzziel, and the Jerusalem,
paraphrase the words there, "from wine new and old, he shall separate
himself"; and they allow strong drink to a Nazarite, that has no wine in
it: their canon (r) runs thus,

"three things are forbidden a Nazarite, defilement, and shaving, and
whatever proceeds from the vine, whether fruit, or the refuse of fruit;
but strong drink made of dates, or dried figs, and such like, is free
for a Nazarite; and the strong drink which is forbidden him in the law,
is strong drink made of mixture of wine.

But the Hebrew word, and which is here retained by the evangelist,
signifies (s) any sort of liquor, which is inebriating, whether it is
made of fruits, or honey, or what not. The Jews had no such strong drink
as ours, which we call beer or ale; but they speak of the strong drink
of the Medes, which they say was an inebriating liquor, made of barley
(t):

and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb;
or "whilst in his mother's womb", as the Syriac, Arabic, and Persic
versions render it: like Jeremiah, he was sanctified, set apart, and
ordained to be the prophet of the Highest, before he came out of his
mother's womb; and was then under such an influence of the Spirit of
God, as to leap in it for joy, at the salutation of the mother of Christ
to his, [Luk 1:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#041.md) and very early
appeared to have the extraordinary gifts and graces of the Holy Ghost,
qualifying him for his work,

And many of the children of Israel,.... To whom only, or at least
chiefly, he was sent, and came preaching, and administering the
ordinance of baptism; and great multitudes of them flocked unto him,
attended on his ministry, believed in his doctrine, and submitted to his
baptism, but not all; for some slighted his preaching, and rejected his
baptism: however, some there were, and many too, that were converted
under his ministry, confessed their sins, and were baptized by him;
which verified this prediction:

shall he turn to the Lord their God; not Jehovah, the Father; for though
he was the Lord God of the Jews in general, and of those that were
turned by John's ministry in a special manner; yet John cannot be said
"to go before him", as he is in the next verse; but the Messiah is here
meant, who is the Lord Jehovah, and is often so called in the Old
Testament; particularly in a prophecy afterwards respected, [Isa
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003.md) a name peculiar to God alone: and
who also is called God, as he is frequently with additional epithets; as
the mighty God, God over all, the great God, the true God, and eternal
life; and our, your, and their God, the God of his covenant people,
whether Jews or Gentiles; see [Isa
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#009.md). Conversion, which is meant by
turning to God, is not man's work, but God's; and is effected by his
mighty power, which is only equal to it; but John was to be, and was, an
instrument of the conversion of many among the Jews, by preaching the
doctrine of repentance towards God, and faith in the Messiah, that was
just ready to come: he was the means in the hand of God, of turning many
from sin, of bringing them to a true sense of it, and to an hearty and
ingenuous confession and acknowledgment of it; and from trusting to, and
depending upon, their birth privileges, legal duties, and
self-righteousness; and from their gross notions of a temporal Messiah;
and of leading them to believe in Christ as a spiritual Saviour, as the
Lamb of God, that should take away the sin of the world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 1:17</span></span>

And he shall go before him,.... The Lord his God, the Lord Jesus Christ,
whose forerunner he was; the messenger of him, that according to the
prophecies in [Isa 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003.md) was to go
before him, and prepare his ways; as he did by his wonderful conception
and birth, which made way for the more easy belief of the conception and
birth of the Messiah, by a virgin; and by his preaching the doctrine of
repentance, and administering the ordinance of baptism; which, were done
to awaken the people's expectation of the Messiah, and that he might be
made manifest in Israel, and by pointing him out to them in his
preaching:

in the spirit and power of Elias: or Elijah, the Syriac and Persic
versions add, "the prophet"; John the Baptist, and Elijah, were men much
of the same spirit and disposition, and of like power, life, and zeal in
religion; and therefore the one goes by the name of the other: they both
much conversed in the wilderness; agreed in the austerity of their
lives; their habit and dress were much alike; they were both restorers
of religion, when very low, and much decayed; were famous for their
faithfulness in reproving the vices of kings, and for their warm zeal
for true religion, and for the persecution they endured for the sake of
it:

to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children in [Mal
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#006.md) which is the prophecy referred to,
it is added,

and the heart of the children to their fathers; which some understand,
of his turning the degenerate offspring of the Jews, to the sentiments
of their forefathers, and causing them to agree with them in their
notions of the Messiah: others, of the turning of the Jews to Christ,
and his apostles; and others, of his being a means, through his ministry
and baptism, of reconciling Jews and Gentiles together, which is the
great business of the Gospel dispensation, ushered in by John; and who
preached that all men should believe in Christ, and baptized publicans
and Roman soldiers, as well as Jews; and which sense pretty much agrees
with the interpretation the Jews put upon the prophecy, as referring to
Elijah the Tishbite, whom they expect in person, before the coming of
the Messiah: say (u) they,

"Elijah comes to defile and to cleanse (i.e. to pronounce what things
are clean or unclean), and to remove afar off, and to bring near (i.e.
to determine what families are legitimate or illegitimate). R. Simeon
says, "to compose differences"; and the wise men say, neither to remove,
nor to bring near, but , "to make peace" in the world; as it is said,
"behold, I send unto you Elijah the prophet", &c. "and he shall turn the
heart of the fathers", &c.

But the true meaning is, that John the Baptist, who is meant by Elias,
should be an instrument of turning fathers with their children, and
children with their fathers, to the Lord; that he should be a means of
converting both fathers and children, one as well as another; and to
gather persons of every age and station; for the particle which we
render "to", is the same as "with", as Kimchi on the text observes: "and
the disobedient to the wisdom of the just". By the "disobedient" are
meant, either Jews or Gentiles; some understand it of the Gentiles, who
were children of disobedience, before the light of the Gospel came among
them: but rather the former are meant, who were a disobedient,
rebellious, and gainsaying people; who were gone off from the wisdom,
knowledge, and religion, of the just, or righteous ones, their
forefathers; who prophesied of Christ, rejoiced to see his day, longed
for him, and believed in him: now John was to be an instrument of
turning some of the unbelieving Jews, to the true knowledge of salvation
by Christ; which their righteous progenitors waited for, had a right
knowledge of, and an interest in: and of leading them either into the
Gospel of Christ, that wisdom of God is a mystery; the manifold wisdom
of God, in which he has abounded in all wisdom and prudence: and which
the righteous men among the Jews, searched diligently into, attained
some knowledge of, and which even the holy angels desire to look into;
so the patriarchs were called just, or righteous; as righteous Abel,
just Noah, &c. and so the Jewish fathers: hence in the Targum on [Jer
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#005.md) mention is made of thy fathers,
"the just", who were of old: or to Christ himself, who is the wisdom of
God, and in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, to
know him, and believe in him; who in the same Targum on [Jer
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005.md) is called , "the Messiah of the
just",

To make ready a people prepared for the Lord. The Vulgate Latin and
Syriac versions read, "a perfect people"; and the Persic version, "all
the people": not all the people of the Jews, but God's elect among them
who from all eternity were "prepared", as a people in a covenant
relation, as the portion of Christ, and as his spouse and bride, and as
such, given to him; they were in electing grace, vessels of mercy, afore
prepared for glory; and heaven, as a kingdom, was prepared for them from
the foundation of the world: they were provided with all spiritual
blessings, which were prepared for them, and bestowed on them in
heavenly places, in Christ, before the foundation of the world; even all
their grace, and all their glory; yea, even their good works are such,
which God has foreordained, or foreprepared that they should walk in.
Now, the work of John the Baptist, was "to make ready" this people, by
pointing out to them, in a ministerial way, wherein their readiness lay,
to meet the Lord, and be for ever with him in heaven; not in a civil,
moral, or legal righteousness; or in outward humiliation for, and
abstinence from sin; nor in a submission to Gospel ordinances, and in a
mere profession of religion, and in an observance of a round of duties;
but in justification by the righteousness of Christ, and in regeneration
and sanctification, by his Spirit and grace; the one giving a right to,
the other a meetness for the heavenly inheritance: and John; and so any
other Gospel minister, may be said to make ready a people, in this
sense; when they are the instruments of the regeneration and conversion
of sinners, and of leading them to the righteousness of Christ, for
their justification before God, and acceptance with him,

And Zacharias said unto the angel, whereby shall I know this?....
Notwithstanding such an appearance of an angel to him, which in those
times was not so usual, and this in the holy place; and the things
themselves which were told him, and these as the return of prayer; yet
he distrusted, and wanted a sign, whereby he might know the truth of
them, as the Jews were generally desirous of, and as the father of them
was; who expressed himself in much such language, on a certain occasion,
as this his son did; see [Gen 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#008.md).

For I am an old man; at least sixty years of age; for with the Jews,
sixty years were reckoned, "for old age" (w); and a man of these years,
was accounted an old man: and the Jewish Rabbins observe (x), that the
word for old age in [Job 30:2](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#002.md) is by
"gematry, sixty"; that is, the letters of the word, numerically make so
much. The Mahometan writers, as before observed on [Luk
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#007.md) make him to be ninety nine years
of age: he was not discharged from service; the Levites were at fifty,
but not the priests; blemishes, as the Jewish writers say (y), made them
unfit for service, but years did not: and even the law concerning the
Levites, they say (z), only respected the time they carried the
sanctuary from place to place, and not future generations; and that they
are disqualified neither by blemishes, nor by years, only by voice, for
singing of the song; but then they might be among the porters; so that
they were not on that account laid aside from all service:

and my wife well stricken in years. The Mahometan writers, as before,
say, she was "eighty nine"; a like objection Abraham made, though he
afterwards got over it, and was strong in faith, giving glory to God,
believing in his power and faithfulness; see [Gen

And the angel answering, said unto him, I am Gabriel,.... The name of an
angel well known to Zacharias from Daniel's prophecies, [Dan
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#016.md) and is the first time we read of
the name of an angel: the Jews say (a), the names of angels came out of
Babylon, by the means of the Israelites; and it was there that Daniel
became acquainted with this name of Gabriel, and also of Michael.
Frequent mention is made of Gabriel in the Jewish writings (b): were
there a particular angel appointed over conception, as the Jews say (c)
there is, one would be ready to think it should be Gabriel, since he was
sent to declare the conception and birth both of John the Baptist, and
of our Lord Jesus Christ: the name of that angel the Jews indeed say (d)
is Lilah; but yet the Cabalistic doctors (e) affirm, that that angel is
under Gabriel. In what language this angel spoke to Zacharias, and
afterwards to Mary, may be a needless inquiry; but since the Syriac
language was generally spoken, and understood by the Jews at this time,
it is highly reasonable that he spoke to them in that. The Jews have a
notion, that none of the ministering angels understand the Syriac
language, excepting Gabriel; and he, they say, understood seventy
languages (f). Now the angel, by making mention of his name, puts
Zacharias in mind of the prophecy of Daniel concerning the coming of the
Messiah, which he had from him; and whereas his name signified, "a man
of God", or "the power", or "strength of God", or "God is my strength",
he suggests unto him, that he ought not to have distrusted his Words,
since with God all things are possible: he adds,

that stand in the presence of God; beholding his face, hearkening to his
voice, and ministering to him, and so had this affair immediately from
him: and therefore he had no reason to doubt of the accomplishment of
it. Gabriel, according to the Jews, is one of the four angels that
surround the throne of God: their names are Michael, Uriel, Raphael, and
Gabriel (g),

"Michael they place at his right hand, and Uriel at his left hand, and
Gabriel, before him, (in his presence, as he here says of himself,) over
against the kingdom of Judah, and Moses and Aaron, who were in the east
(of the camp of Israel); and why is his name called Gabriel? of Judah it
is written, [Ch1 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#002.md) "for Judah",
"prevailed above his brethren"; and of Moses it is written, [Lev
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md) "and God called unto Moses"; and
it is written, [Isa 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md) "and shall
call his name Wonderful, Counselor, the mighty God, lo! Gabriel".

And am sent to speak unto thee, and to show unto thee these glad
tidings: wherefore, on account of his name, his office, and his mission,
especially the subject of it being welcome news, good tidings, what he
said ought to have obtained credit with him. Gabriel was one of the
ministering spirits sent to minister to them that were heirs of
salvation; his messages were messages of mercy, grace and love; he was
not a minister of the wrath and vengeance of God, but of his favour.
Agreeably to this the Jews say of him, that his name Gabriel is, by
"gematry", or numerically, the same with "merciful" (h): he is called,
in the Talmud (i), "the decisive spirit", and is said to have three
names, Piskon, Itmon, and Sigron. He is called Piskon, because he
decides, or determines judgment against them that are above; and Itmon,
because he stops up the sins of the Israelites; and Sigron, because when
he shuts (the gates of judgment) there is none can open again. Hence
also they say, that he is the angel that is appointed over water which
quenches fire. The Targumist on [Job
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#002.md) paraphrases the words thus:

"Michael on the right hand, who is over fire; and Gabriel on the left
hand, who is over water; and the holy creatures mingle fire and water,
and by his dominion and fear, make peace in his heaven of heavens.

And behold, thou shalt be dumb, &c. Or "silent; and not able to speak",
if he would. Silence is sometimes voluntary; but this was what he could
not help;

until the day that these thing shall be performed; which he had said
concerning the conception and birth of a son, and the imposition of a
name on him; for this dumbness remained upon Zachariah, not only until
his wife had conceived, and the child was born, but until the eighth day
after, when he was circumcised, and his name was given him the angel
directed to: "because thou believest not my words": he was struck both
deaf and dumb, as appears from his friends making signs to him, [Luk
1:62](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#062.md) which they had no need to have
done, could he have heard: he was struck with deafness, because he
hearkened not to the angel's words; and with dumbness, because from the
unbelief of his heart he objected to them. We learn from hence, what an
evil unbelief is, and how much resented by God, and how much it becomes
us to take heed, that it prevails not in us: and especially since it
easily besets us: "which shall be fulfilled in their season"; first the
conception, then the birth; after that the calling him by his name, and
in process of time, the doing of his work and office; so that the
unbelief Zacharias did not make the faith of God of none effect; for
though sometimes the people of God are very unbelieving, yet he abides
faithful to his word and promises. Mahomet, in his Alkoran (k), very
wrongly makes the angel to say these words to Zacharias,

"thy sign shall be, that thou shalt speak unto no man for three days,
otherwise than by gesture.

And elsewhere (l) it is said three nights,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 1:21</span></span>

And the people waited for Zacharias,.... That were without, in the court
of the Israelites, praying there, while he was offering incense: these
were waiting for his coming out, in order to be blessed by him,
according to [Num 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#023.md) and be
dismissed: and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple; beyond
the usual time of burning incense; which might be occasioned either by a
longer discourse of the angel with him than what is here related; or
being struck with amazement at the sight and hearing of the angel, he
might continue long musing on this unexpected appearance and relation;
or he might spend some time not only in meditation upon it, but in
mental prayer, confession, and thanksgiving. The high priest, when he
went in to burn incense on the day of atonement,

"made a short prayer in the outward house, (in the temple,) and he did
not continue long in his prayer, , "that he might not affright" the
Israelites'' (m),

thinking that he was dead; for many high priests that were unfit for, or
made alteration in the service, died in the holy of holies (n),

"It is reported (o) of one high priest, that he continued long in his
prayer, and his brethren, the priests, thought to have gone in after
him; and they began to go in, and he came out; they say unto him, why
didst thou continue long in thy prayer? he replied to them, is it hard
in your eyes that I should pray for you, and for the house of the
sanctuary, that it might not be destroyed? they answered him, be not
used to do so; for we have learned, that a man should not continue long
in prayer, that he may not affright Israel.

This high priest, they elsewhere say (p), was Simeon the just,

benediction they were waiting for:

made them to understand, by the gestures he used: for he beckoned unto
them; nodding his head, or by some motions of his hands the Ethiopic
version adds, "with his hand": or of his lips; for the signs of a dumb
man are distinguished into and (q); the one is a sign which is expressed
by the head and hands; and the other is a sign expressed by the lips:

were accomplished: for though he was deaf and dumb, he was not hereby
disqualified for service. Deafness and dumbness excused persons from
various duties (s) but did not disqualify priests: a Levite, if he had
lost his voice, was disqualified, but not a priest; (t) the reason was
this, because it was one part of the work of the Levites to sing, and
therefore could not perform it without a voice; but such was the work of
the priests, that though deaf and dumb, they could discharge it; as
cleansing the altar, trimming the lamps, carrying the parts to the
altar, laying them upon it, and burning them, or offering any sacrifice,
burning incense, &c. which was the business of Zacharias; which when he
had fulfilled, he departed to his own house; which was not at Jerusalem,
but in the hill country, in a city of Judah there; see [Luk

And after those days,.... The days of his ministration in the temple,
quickly after his return home; the Ethiopic version reads, "after two
days":

his wife Elisabeth conceived; according to the angels prediction, and
notwithstanding her barrenness, and the unbelief of her husband,

and hid herself five months. The Arabic and Persic versions render it,
"hid her size"; but there could be no occasion to take any methods to
hide this, since, if she said nothing of it herself, and there could be
no suspicion of it in one of her years, it could not be much discerned
in her by such a time; but she hid herself, or lived retired, that she
might be fully satisfied that she was with child, before she said any
thing about it; and that she might not discover any pride or vanity on
account of it; and to avoid all discourse with others about it, which
might be rumoured abroad; and chiefly to shun all ceremonial
uncleanness, which one, that bred a Nazarite, was obliged to; see [Jdg
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#014.md) and most of all, that she might
be retired, and spend her time in meditation upon the goodness of God,
and in returning thanks to him for the favour she had received; saying;
as in the following verse.

[Luke 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 1:25</span></span>

Thus hath the Lord dealt with me,.... In a very gracious and bountiful
manner; in giving her strength to conceive a son in her old age, and
such an one that was to be great, and so useful in his day; of which her
husband had doubtless informed her by writing, though he could not
speak:

in the days wherein he looked on me; with a favourable eye, with a look
of love and mercy:

he took away my reproach from among men; as barrenness was accounted,
especially among the Israelites, the seed of Abraham; to whom was
promised a numerous issue, as the stars in the sky, and as the sand on
the sea shore, and particularly the Messiah; see [Gen
30:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#023.md).

And in the sixth month,.... After Elisabeth's conception; for so long
was John the Baptist conceived before Christ, and so long he was born
before him; and it seems as if there was the same distance between the
public ministry of the one, and the other: John was before Christ, as
man, being his forerunner; but Christ was preferred unto him as
mediator, and existed before him, as the eternal Son of God:

the angel Gabriel was sent from God; the same angel, that near five
hundred years before gave Daniel an exact account of the time of the
Messiah's coming, and six months ago acquainted Zacharias with the
conception, birth, character, and office of his forerunner:

unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth; the whole country of Galilee was
mean and contemptible with the Jews: they observe, though through
mistake, that no prophet arose out of it, [Joh
7:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#052.md) and Nazareth particularly was
exceeding despicable in their eye: hence those words of Nathanael, "can
any good thing come out of Nazareth?" [Joh
1:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#046.md) and yet hither an angel was sent
by God; and here dwelt the mother of our Lord. See Gill on [Mat

[Luke 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#027.md)

To a virgin,.... A pure virgin, that never knew man; see Gill on [Luk
1:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#034.md) and yet

espoused to a man whose name was Joseph; but they were not come
together, nor had he taken her for his wife, and home to his house, nor
had they cohabited:

of the house of David; which, according to the grammatical construction
of the words, may be connected either with the virgin, or with Joseph,
to whom she was espoused; and is true of both; for they both were of the
house and lineage of David: and this shows what a low condition David's
family was in, that the persons that were the nearest allied to it were
a carpenter, and a poor virgin; and both residing in so despicable a
place as Nazareth in Galilee:

and the virgin's name was Mary; a name frequent among the Jews, and the
same with Miriam; of which name was the sister of Moses and Aaron.

where she was:

and said, hail; all health, happiness, and prosperity attend thee; [Mat
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#009.md).

thou art highly favoured; or graciously accepted, or hast obtained
grace; not referring to electing, redeeming; justifying, pardoning,
adopting, and sanctifying grace, which she had in common with other
saints; but to that special and particular favour, in being chosen and
singled out from all other women, to be the mother of the Messiah:

the Lord is with thee; so the angel to Gideon, [Jdg
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#012.md) or "be with thee", an usual form
of salutation among the Jews; [Rut
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#004.md).

thou art blessed among women; and will be pronounced so by other women,
as she was by Elisabeth, [Luk 1:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#042.md) and
by another woman, [Luk 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#027.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 1:29</span></span>

And when she saw him,.... The Persic version renders it, "when Mary saw
the angel"; which expresses the true sense of the words, The Vulgate
Latin reads, "when she heard"; i.e. the salutation:

she was troubled at his saying; at his speaking to her; she was
surprised at the sight of him, and more at what he said to her,

and cast in her mind, or thought and reasoned within herself,

what manner of salutation this should be; for it was not usual with the
Jews for a man to use any salutation to a woman; with them it was not
lawful to be done in any shape or form; not by a messenger, nor even by
her own husband (u); so that Mary might well be thrown into a concern
what should be the meaning of this; and especially, that she should be
addressed in such language, and saluted as a peculiar favourite of God,
and blessed among women,

confusion she was in,

fear not, Mary; he calls her by her name, signifying that she was well
known to him, as the saints are to the ministering angels, who are often
sent unto them, encamp about them, and do them many good offices; and
bids her not be afraid, he had no ill design upon her, nor brought any
ill news to her:

for thou has found favour, or "found grace with God"; and what that
particular grace and favour was, is expressed in the following verses.

[Luke 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 1:31</span></span>

And behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb,.... Though a pure virgin,
which never knew a man; and therefore, "a behold", is prefixed to it, as
being what was extraordinary and wonderful; as it is also, in the
prophesy of it, in [Isa 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014.md) to which
the angel manifestly refers, and is, by Matthew cited, as accomplished
hereby; see Gill on [Mat 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#022.md), [Mat

and bring forth a Son, and shalt call his name Jesus; which signifies a
"Saviour"; and a Saviour Christ is of God's appointing, providing and
sending; and a very suitable one, being a spiritual Saviour, and a
complete one, both able and willing to save to the uttermost all that
believe in him; nor is there any other, nor salvation in any other: he
is the Saviour of his people, whom the Father has given him, even of all
the elect, whether of Jews or Gentiles; and of them from all their sins,
and from all their enemies; and whom he saves with a spiritual and
eternal salvation.

He shall be great,.... In his person, as God-man; this child born, and
Son given, being the angel of the great counsel, the mighty God, and
everlasting Father; [Isa 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md) which is
here referred to; and in his offices, in his prophetic office, being
that great and famous prophet Moses spoke of, mighty in word and deed,
in his doctrine and miracles; in his priestly office, being a great high
priest, both in the oblation of himself, and in his prevalent
intercession; and in his kingly office, being the King of kings, and
Lord of Lords; and in the whole of his office, as Mediator, being a
great Saviour, the author of a great salvation for great sinners; in
which is greatly displayed the glory of all the divine perfections:
great also in his works, the miracles that he wrought, as proofs of his
Deity and Messiahship, the work of redemption, the resurrection of
himself from the dead, and of all men at the last day; and in the glory
he is now possessed of in human nature, at the Father's right hand,
where he is highly exalted above all principality and power:

and shall be called the Son of the Highest; that is, of God, of whose
names is "the Most High"; see [Gen
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#018.md) not by creation, as angels and
men, nor by adoption, as saints, nor by office, as magistrates, are
called "the children of the Most High", [Psa
82:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#006.md) but by nature, being the eternal
Son of God; of the same nature with him, and equal to him: for he was
not now to begin to be the Son of God, he was so before, even from all
eternity; but the sense is, that he should now be known, owned, and
acknowledged to be the Son of God, being as such manifested in human
nature, and should be proved to be so by the works he wrought, and
declared to be the Son of God with power by his resurrection from the
dead:

and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David.
Christ, as God, is the Son of God, as man, the son of David; a name
often given to the Messiah, and by which he was well known among the
Jews; and as Christ descended from him as man, in a literal sense, he
had a right to the throne of his father David; and the Jews themselves
say, that he was , "nearly allied to the kingdom" (w): but here it
intends not his throne, in a literal, but in a figurative sense; for as
David was a type of the Messiah in his kingly office, hence the Messiah
is called "David their king", [Hos 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005.md)
so his throne was typical of the Messiah's throne and kingdom; which is
not of this world, but is in his church, and is set up in the hearts of
his people, where he reigns by his Spirit and grace; and this is a
throne and kingdom "given" by the Lord God. The kingdom of nature and
providence he has by right of nature, as the Son of the Highest; the
kingdom of grace, or the mediatorial kingdom, the kingdom of priests, or
royal priesthood, is a delegated one; his Father has set him as king
over his holy hill of Zion; and he is accountable for his government to
him, and will one day deliver it up complete and perfect,

And he shall reign over the house of Jacob,.... Not over the Jews, the
posterity of Jacob, in a literal sense; but over the whole Israel of
God, consisting of Jews and Gentiles. For as his father David reigned
over the Idumeans, Syrians, and others, as well as over the house of
Judah and Israel, so this his son shall reign over both Jews and
Gentiles: his kingdom shall be from one end of the earth to the other,
even over all the elect of God; who in successive generations call
themselves by the name of Jacob, and surname themselves by the name of
Israel, of whatsoever nation they be; and this reign of his shall be

Then said Mary to the angel, how shall this be,.... This she said not as
doubting the truth of what was said; for she required no sign, as
Zacharias did; nor is she charged with, and blamed for unbelief, as he
was; yea, it is expressly said, [Luk
1:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#045.md) that she believed: nor was this a
curious question, as whether she should have this son by a man in a
married state, or in her present virgin state; for she clearly
understood the angel to mean the latter; and therefore her words express
her admiration at it, and also her desire to be informed of the manner
how it should be: as to the matter of fact, she did not dispute it, but
wanted to be resolved by what means it would be brought about: she knew,
by prophecy, that the Messiah was to be born of a virgin, and she
perceived, by the angel's declaration, that she was that virgin, but
could not imagine in what way this amazing thing should be effected; and
therefore proposes this question for the following reason,

seeing I know not a man? "A husband", as the Arabic version renders it;
not Joseph, nor any other man; for though she was espoused to Joseph,
yet he had not taken her to wife; nor were they, as yet; come together;
and before they did, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost, [Mat
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#018.md) she was a pure virgin, untouched
by man. The words are an "euphemism", or a modest way of expressing
carnal copulation; see [Gen 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#001.md).

[Luke 1:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">luk 1:35</span></span>

And the angel answered and said unto her,.... The angel gave her an
account of the manner in which what he had said should be effected, as
well as observed some things for the strengthening of her faith,

The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee. The words, "upon thee", are left
out in the Syriac and Persic versions; but are retained in others, and
in all copies: the formation of Christ's human nature, though common to
all the three persons, yet is particularly, and most properly ascribed
to the Spirit; not to the first person, the Father, lest it should be
thought that he is only the Father of him, as man; nor to the second
person, the Son, since it is to him that the human nature is personally
united; but to the third person, the Spirit, who is the sanctifier; and
who separated, and sanctified it, the first moment of its conception,
and preserved it from the taint of original sin. His coming upon the
virgin must be understood in consistence with his omnipresence, and
immensity; and cannot design any local motion, but an effectual
operation in forming the human nature of her flesh and substance; and
not in the ordinary manner in which he is concerned in the formation of
all men, [Job 33:4](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#004.md) but in an
extraordinary way, not to be conceived of, and explained. The phrase
most plainly answers to , in frequent use with the Jews (x), as
expressive of coition,

And the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee. By "the power of the
Highest" is not meant the Lord Jesus Christ, who is sometimes called the
power of God; but rather the Holy Ghost, as before, who is styled the
finger of God, and power from on high, [Luk
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#020.md) unless it should be thought that
the perfection of divine power common to all the three persons is
intended: and so points out the means by which the wondrous thing should
be performed, even by the power of God; and which should not only be
employed in forming the human nature of Christ, but in protecting the
virgin from any suspicion and charge of sin, and defending her innocence
and virtue, by moving upon Joseph to take her to wife. In the word,
"overshadow", some think there is an allusion to the Spirit of God
moving upon the face of the waters, in [Gen
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002.md) when, he brooded upon them, as the
word may be rendered; and which is the sense of it, according to the
Jewish writers (y) as a hen, or any other bird broods on its eggs to
exclude its young: and others have thought the allusion may be to , (z),
"the nuptial covering": which was a veil, or canopy, like a tent,
supported on four staves, under which the bridegroom and bride were
betrothed; or, as Dr. Lightfoot thinks, it is a modest phrase alluding
to the conjugal embraces, signified by a man's spreading the skirt of
his garment over the woman, which Ruth desired of Boaz, [Rut
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#009) though the Jewish writers say (a.md),
that phrase is expressive of the act of marriage, or taking to wife. The
phrase of being "overshadowed", or "covered with the spirit of
prophecy", as the virgin also was, is used by the Targumist, on [Ch1
2:55](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#055.md).

therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be
called the Son of God. The human nature of Christ is here called a
"thing"; for it was not a person; it never subsisted of itself, but was
taken at once into union with the person of the Son of God, otherwise
there would be two persons in Christ, whereas he is God, and man, in one
person; and it is said to be "holy", being free from that original
pollution and sin, in which all that descend from Adam, by ordinary
generation, are conceived, and brought forth; and is, moreover, said to
be born of a virgin, "of thee", or "out of thee". Christ's flesh was
formed out of the Virgin's; he took flesh of her; his body did not
descend from heaven, or pass through her, as water through a pipe, as
some heretics of old said: nor did his human nature, either as to soul
or body, pre-exist his incarnation; but in the fulness of time he was
made of a woman, and took a true body of her, and a reasonable soul,
into union with his divine person; and "therefore should be called the
Son of God": not that he was now to become the "the Son of God"; he was
so before his incarnation, and even from all eternity; but he was now to
be manifested as such in human nature: nor does the angel predict, that
he should, for this reason, be called the Son of God; for he never was,
on this account, so called, either by himself, or others: nor is the
particle, "therefore", causal, but consequential: the angel is not
giving a reason why Christ should be the Son of God, but why he should
be owned, and acknowledged, as such by his people: who would infer, and
conclude from his wonderful conception and birth, that he is the
"Emmanuel", God with us, the child that was to be born, and the Son
given, whose name should be Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty God, &c.
[Isa 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014.md). Moreover, the word, "also",
is not to be overlooked; and the sense is, that seeing that human
nature, which should be born of the virgin, would be united to the Son
of God, it likewise should bear the same name, being in personal union
with him, who was so from all eternity,

And behold thy cousin Elisabeth,.... For though Elisabeth was of the
daughters of Aaron, or of the tribe of Levi by her father's side, yet
might be of the tribe of Judah by her mother's side, and so akin to
Mary. The Persic version calls her "aunt by the mother's side":
intermarriages between the two tribes of Levi and Judah were frequent;
nor were they at all contrary to the intention of that law, that forbid
the tribes to intermarry, which was to preserve the inheritance in each
tribe, since the tribe of Levi had none at all. Though she might be
called her cousin in a more general sense; it being usual with the Jews
to call all of their own nation their kinsmen and kinswomen, according
to the flesh: but the former sense seems more agreeable; and so Mary is
directed to her own family, and to her own relations, and known friends,
for a sign, by which her faith might be confirmed, in what the angel had
said unto her; for if she found the one to be true, she might conclude
the other was also; which is as follows:

she hath also conceived a son in her old age: though Mary asked no sign,
yet one is given her, whereby she might know the truth of what was
spoken: for if it should appear that Elisabeth had received strength to
conceive, as was declared by the angel; and that a son, too, which he
could not have known without a divine revelation; and that in her old
age, which, was extraordinary and supernatural, she might assure
herself, that the message brought to her was from God; and that she
likewise, though a virgin, might conceive, and bear a son: the angel
adds, as a further testimony of the truth of things,

and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. Elisabeth,
was generally known to be barren, and was, by way of reproach, usually
called so, but was now six months gone with child; so that it was a
plain case, and out of question; the signs of her pregnancy were very
apparent.

[Luke 1:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 1:37</span></span>

For with God nothing shall be impossible. That is consistent with his
nature and perfections, with his counsels, purposes, and promises: every
thing that he has said, purposed, or promised, he is able to do, and
will; every word that he has spoken, every thing predicted by his
prophets, or declared by his angels, and particularly this of a virgin's
conceiving and bearing a Son: so that the angel not only answers her
question, how this should be, but confirms her faith in it; partly by
the instance of her cousin Elisabeth, and partly by observing the
infinite omnipotence of God.

And Mary said, behold the handmaid of the Lord,.... In which words she
expresses her obedience of faith; she owns herself to be the handmaid of
the Lord, and desires to obey him, and be submissive to him as such; and
tacitly acknowledges her meanness, and great unworthiness:

be it unto me according to thy word; she assented to what the angel said
should be unto her; she earnestly desired it might be, and firmly
believed it would be; she set her "Amen" to the angel's message:

and the angel departed from her; to the heavenly regions from whence he
came; to his great Lord and master, that sent him; having dispatched the
business he came about, and which he was accountable to him for.

And Mary arose in those days,.... The Ethiopic version renders it, "in
that day"; directly, immediately, as soon as the angel was gone from
her; partly to know the truth of things, and to make use of the sign
which had been given her, for the further confirmation of her faith,
which was very right and proper for her to do; and partly to converse
with Elisabeth about the great things which God had done for each of
them, and to praise his name together: "and went into the hill country
with haste"; the same which is called the country of the hills, and the
hills, and the mountains, in [Jos
10:40](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#040.md) where the Septuagint use the
same word as here: the land of Judea was divided into three parts, "the
mountain", or hill country, the champaign country, and the valley (b):
from Betboron to Emmaus is "the hill country"; from Emmaus to Lud, or
Lydda, is the champaign country; and from Lydda to the sea, the valley
(c). This place is frequently called, in the Jewish writings (d), the
king's mountain, or the royal mountain, and is said to be very full of
cities: ten thousand cities, they say (e), were in the king's mountain,
and a thousand of them belonged to R. Eleazer ben Harsum: yea, they say
(f), that king Jannai had sixty myriads of cities in the mountain of the
king. The Syriac, Arabic, and Persic versions render it, "went to the
mountain", to this mountain, and which is called the mountain, or, as we
read it, the hill country of Judah, [Jos
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#011.md) on which Hebron was situated;
and seems to be the city next mentioned: into a city of Judah; for that
was given to the children of Aaron and so may reasonably be thought to
be the city where Zacharias dwelt, and not Jerusalem, which was in the
tribe of Benjamin. Hebron was a city peculiar to the priests; whereas
Jerusalem was not; and it was in the hill country of Judea; it was
remarkable for the goodness of its stones. It is said (g).

"you have no stones in all the land of Israel harder than at Hebron;
hence they buried the dead there.

And entered into the house of Zacharias, &c. Which was in the above
city, and might be well known to her: and saluted Elisabeth; not
Zacharias; either because he was not at home; or because he was deaf and
dumb, and could neither hear her salutation, nor return it; or because
it was not usual for women to salute men, nor men to salute women; See
Gill on [Luk 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#029.md), yet one woman might
salute another; and especially Mary saluted Elisabeth, because she came
to pay the visit to her, and it was with her she was principally
concerned.

[Luke 1:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">luk 1:41</span></span>

And it came to pass that when Elisabeth heard the salutation of
Mary,.... Which might be before she saw her, and at some little distance
from her:

the babe leaped in her womb: which motion was not natural, but
supernatural; being made at hearing the voice of Mary, who had now
conceived the Messiah, whose forerunner this babe, John the Baptist, was
to be; and who, by this motion, gave the first notice of his conception,
which his mother Elisabeth took from hence; as he afterwards pointed him
out by his finger, and by his baptism made him manifest to Israel:

and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost not with the ordinary
graces of the Spirit, for these she had been filled with before, but
with extraordinary gifts, with a spirit of prophecy; by which she knew
that the Messiah was conceived, and that Mary was the mother of her
Lord; that many things had been told her; that she had believed them;
and there would be a performance of them; and perhaps it was at this
time that John the Baptist was filled with the Holy Ghost also; see [Luk
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#015.md).

[Luke 1:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">luk 1:42</span></span>

And she spake out with a loud voice,.... So as that all in the house
might hear; she spake with great vehemency of soul, and strength of
affection, being under a very powerful impression of the Spirit of God:
and said,

blessed art thou among women; the same words that the angel had said to
her before, [Luk 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#028.md).

and blessed is the fruit of thy womb: this is a reason why she is called
blessed, because her child was blessed; being in union with a divine
person, who is God over all, blessed for ever; and who has all spiritual
blessings in him, and is that seed, in which all nations of the earth
were to be blessed; and so is both blessed in himself, and the source of
all blessedness to others. The Jews say (h), that the six measures of
barley, Boaz gave to Ruth, [Rut 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#015.md)
signified, that six righteous men should spring from her, and among,
them the Messiah; who should be blessed with six blessings, and they are
these; the spirit of wisdom and understanding, of counsel and of might,
the spirit of knowledge, and of the fear of the Lord; see [Isa
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002.md).

And whence is this to me,..... How comes it to pass, that such notice is
taken of me, such an honour is done me; that besides being favoured with
a child, who shall be great,

that the mother of my Lord should come to me? Elisabeth was far from
envying the superior honour conferred on her kinswoman, who was both
meaner and younger than she; that she esteems it a wonderful favour,
that she should be indulged with a visit from her, who had already
conceived the Messiah: and in due time would be the mother of him, as
man; who, in his divine nature, is Lord of all angels, and men, and
every creature; and in an especial manner was her Lord, and the Lord of
all the saints; by his Father's gift from eternity, by his own purchase
in time, and by the power of his grace on each of their souls. Thus the
virgin is said to be the mother of our Lord, and so may be called the
mother of God; because she was parent of that child, which was in union
with him, who is truly Lord and God: Just in such sense as the Lord of
life and glory is said to be crucified, and God is said to purchase the
church with his own blood,

For lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears,....
This she mentions, as the signal by which she knew that she was the
mother of her Lord; namely, from that unusual and extraordinary motion
of the child, she felt within her:

the babe leaped in my womb for joy; that the mother of her Lord, and
his, was come thither: the Jews ought not to object to this, who affirm,
that the embryos, or infants in their mother's womb, sung the song at
the Red Sea, and praised God. (i).

And blessed is she that believed..... Meaning Mary, a woman, a very
young woman, and who had had things very incredible to nature and reason
told her; and yet she believed, without objecting thereto, or requiring
a sign; tacitly referring to the unbelief of Zacharias, who was a man, a
man in years, a priest by office; and yet had been very incredulous, in
a thing that was much more possible; because there had been instances of
it before, in Sarah, Hannah, and Manoah's wife; than what was related to
the virgin, of which there had been none; and which to reason, and with
men, was impossible: and happy indeed is every one, that has true faith
in any degree; for faith is the faith of God's elect, and is both a
fruit and evidence of electing grace, which is the source of all
blessings; it is the gift of God, and the operation of his Spirit, and
can never be lost: many are the blessings such as believe are in the
possession of, and openly entitled to; as the justification of their
persons, the remission of their sins, their adoption into the household
of God, liberty at the throne of grace, and a right to the eternal
inheritance; they enjoy much solid peace, joy, and comfort in their own
souls; bring much glory to God, and shall be saved in the Lord, with an
everlasting salvation:

for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her
from the Lord: these words may be considered, either as the subject
matter of her faith, and be rendered in connection with the former,
thus, "blessed is she that believed, that there shall be a performance,
&c", being fully persuaded, that what the angel had told her, concerning
the conception and birth of a son, concerning his name, and the
greatness of his person, and the nature, extent, and duration of his
kingdom, should be certainly and punctually fulfilled; or as a reason of
her happiness, because there should be a sure accomplishment of them.
Whatever God has spoken to any of his people, whether it be with respect
to things temporal, spiritual, or eternal, shall be performed; as may be
strongly concluded from the veracity of God, who cannot lie; and from
his power, who is able to do all things; and from his faithfulness,
which he will never suffer to fail; and from instances, and matters of
fact; from the experience of the saints in all ages, who know, and are
conscious to themselves, that not one of the good things the Lord God
has spoken to them, has ever failed, but that all have come to pass; see

And Mary said, my soul doth magnify the Lord. Either Jehovah, the
Father, or the Son; who, as he was David's Lord, according to his divine
nature, though his son after the flesh, was, in the same sense, Mary's
Lord, as well as her son: and by "magnifying" him is meant, not making
him great, for he cannot be made greater than he is; but ascribing
greatness to him, even all the perfections of the Deity, and praising
him on account of them; and also declaring and speaking well of his many
and mighty works of power, goodness, grace, and mercy, and giving him
the glory of them: this Mary did, not in lip and word only, but with her
whole heart and, soul, and with all the powers and faculties of it;
being filled with the Holy Ghost, and under a more than ordinary
influence of his, as her cousin Elisabeth was: and it is to be observed,
that she all along speaks in the prophetic style, of things, as if they
were done, which were doing, or would shortly be done.

And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. Which also, may be
understood, either of God the Father, who was her Saviour, both as the
God of nature and providence; so the Persic version renders it, "in God
that gives me life"; and who had supported, maintained, and preserved
her life; and as the God of grace, who has contrived the scheme of
salvation, fixed upon, and appointed Christ to be the Saviour; and who
saves by him, and therefore is sometimes said to be our Saviour. [Tit
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#004.md) or of Christ, the Son of God, who
being truly and properly God, was fit to be a Saviour; and is a very
suitable, able, and willing one; and which is the great encouragement to
sensible sinners, to look up to him, and be saved; and lays a solid
foundation for rejoicing in him, since what he did as man, had hereby an
infinite virtue and efficacy put into it, as was put into his blood,
sacrifice, and righteousness; whereby the purposes designed were
answered by them; and since he must be able to keep their immortal
souls, which they commit unto him, and must have an interest with his
Father, as their advocate, and a fulness, to supply all their wants: the
consideration of Christ, by Mary, as God her Saviour, as having an
interest in him, as a Saviour, and this her Saviour, God, gave her
greater joy, than being the mother of him as man; and this her joy was
not carnal, nor merely external, but inward and spiritual: it was a joy
in her own spirit, and was excited there by the holy Spirit of God.

For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden,.... Meaning,
either her outward temporal estate, which was very low and mean: David's
family was now very much reduced, it had its seat not at Jerusalem, but
at Nazareth, in Galilee: Mary, of that house, was a poor virgin, and
Joseph, of the same, to whom she was betrothed, was a poor carpenter;
and yet God passed by the rich and noble families of Jewish people, and
pitched upon this poor virgin to be the mother of the Messiah: or her
estate, in a spiritual sense, which, as that of every son and daughter
of Adam, was very low by the fall; for sin has run all mankind into
debt, and they have nothing to pay: it has stripped them of original
righteousness, and clothed them with rags; it has filled them with
diseases, from the crown of the head to the sole of the feet; it has
exposed them to a prison, into which being cast, they must lie, till
they have paid the uttermost farthing; and has left them hopeless and
helpless, poor and miserable, and blind and naked: but God has
remembered his elect, in this their low estate, and has provided a
Saviour for them, and sent him to deliver them out of it; because his
mercy endures forever; and this Mary was sensible, and there rejoiced in
God her Saviour:

for behold, from henceforth all generations; not Jews only, but Gentiles
also,

shall call me blessed; both on account of her son she had now conceived,
and was bearing; because she was the mother of our Lord, who had reason
so to conclude, from the nature of the thing, and from the words of the
angel, and of Elisabeth, [Luk 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#028.md) and
much more than Leah had, who said something like this, at the birth of
her second son, [Gen 30:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#013.md) and also on
account of her interest in Christ, as God her Saviour: in whom she was
blessed, with all spiritual blessings; so that she was truly blessed,
and might well be called so.

For he that is mighty hath done to me great things,.... With respect to
the incarnation of Christ, a new, a great, and unheard of thing; in
causing her, though a virgin, to conceive; and also to bear such a Son,
who should be called Jesus, a Saviour, Immanuel, God with us; and who
was no other than the mighty God, the everlasting Father, and Prince of
Peace: wherefore she describes God the author of it, by a proper
periphrasis of him, "he that is mighty"; since this was a work of
almighty power, and very justly adds,

and holy is his name: seeing this was brought about without any
impurity, through the overshadowing influence of the Holy Ghost; whereby
the human nature was preserved from the infection of sin, was
sanctified, and fit to be united to the Son of God, and to be a
sacrifice for the sins of his people. This may also have regard to the
great things God had done for her in a spiritual sense; in the choice of
her to eternal life, in the redemption of her by the Messiah, and in her
regeneration and sanctification; wherein God had displayed his sovereign
grace and goodness, and his almighty power, in a way consistent with his
justice and holiness.

And his mercy is on them that fear him,.... Not with slavish fear of
hell and damnation, but with reverence and godly fear; with a filial
fear, with a reverential love of God, and affection for him; with that
fear which springs from the goodness of God, which has that for its
object, and is encouraged by it: and though this fear is not the cause
and reason of the mercy of God, yet is descriptive of the persons
towards whom it is exercised in various ways, and to whom it is openly
shown; they hereby appearing to be the vessels of mercy, afore prepared
to glory; and in whose redemption, mercy and truth have met together,
and who, according to the abundant mercy of God the Father, have been
begotten again; whose unrighteousnesses he has been merciful to, and
whose sins he will remember no more: and it may have a particular regard
to the incarnation of Christ, which in this chapter is said to be in
remembrance of mercy; to be the mercy promised, and to come through the
tender mercy of our God, [Luk 1:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#054.md).
And which was a mercy Mary considered, not as peculiar to herself, but
as extended to all that fear the Lord; not in that age only, but from

generation to generation; to the end of the world, to God's elect in all
times and places, who should all be partakers of it, and sharers in it.

travelling in the greatness of his strength; see [Isa

He hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts; whom he
always resists, and both in providence and grace, takes such methods, as
tend to humble and confound them: here particularly, it may regard the
proud and haughty Jews; who imagined nothing less, than that the Messiah
would be born of one of the rich and noble families in Judea; that he
would appear as a temporal prince, and set up a temporal kingdom in
great state and splendour, and make them a free and flourishing people:
when instead of this, he was to be born of a poor virgin, of whom they
disdainfully say, is not his mother called Mary? who was of Nazareth in
Galilee, of which it is said, shall Christ come out of Galilee? or any
good thing out of Nazareth? A virgin betrothed to a carpenter, and her
son of that business also, with which both were flouted; and because of
this meanness, the Messiah was rejected by them; and thus were they
scattered and confounded in their imaginations.

emperors from their thrones, as he often does, in the course of his
providence; setting up one, and putting down another: or the mighty
angels, from their seats of bliss and happiness in heaven; who rebelling
against God, opposing the incarnation of Christ, taking it ill, that the
human nature should be advanced above theirs, were cast down to hell;
and are reserved in chains of darkness, to the judgment of the great
day: or this may have respect to the putting down the monarchies and
kingdoms of this world, by the kingdom of the Messiah to be set up;
which, though at first was mean and despicable, like a stone cut out of
a mountain, will increase, spread, and break in pieces, and destroy all
other kingdoms:

and exalted them of low degree; as David to the throne of Israel, from
the sheepfold, and following the ewes great with young; and now his
house and family, which were sunk very low, by raising of his seed, of a
poor virgin in his family, unto Israel, a Saviour Jesus; in whose days
the poor had the Gospel preached, and received it: these were chosen and
called: the great things of the Gospel were revealed to babes, and hid
from the wise and prudent; and beggars were raised from the dunghill, to
sit among princes, and to inherit the throne of glory: a method, which
God in his infinite wisdom and grace has been pleased to take, more or
less, in all ages of time; for not many mighty and noble are called by
grace; but usually the foolish, the weak, and the base things of the
world.

Christ, and breathe after the forgiveness of their sins through his

pant after his word and ordinances; these are filled, sooner or later,

of the full and free forgiveness of their sins, and with his
righteousness they hunger after; and with every good thing they stand in
need of, with joy and peace, with food and gladness, even to
satisfaction; so that they can say with Jacob, they have enough, yea,
all things; seeing Christ is theirs, and all things with him:

and the rich he hath sent empty away: not the rich in this world's
goods, though such who trust in their wealth, and boast of their riches,
or do not make a proper use of them, God, in his providence, sometimes
strips them of all, and turns them into the world naked and empty; much
less the rich in grace, who are often the poor of the world; and who,
though they seem to have nothing, yet possess all things, and are full:
but such who are rich in their opinion, and in their own works; and
trust in their righteousness, and despise others; these, as they come
full of themselves to the throne of grace, as the Pharisee, are sent
empty away; without any token of the love and favour of God, or any
blessing from him: and as they come to ordinances in their own strength,
and trust in the performance of them, they go away empty, as they came;
these are dry breasts unto them, whilst they are full breasts of
consolation to the poor in spirit, and to all meek and humble souls: and
what is still worst of all, notwithstanding all their good works they
boast of, and trust in, they will be sent away at the last judgment from
the presence of Christ, as not known by him, and as workers of iniquity.

He hath holpen his servant Israel,.... Meaning, not the natural
posterity of Jacob, or Israel in general, but the elect of God among
them; for all were not Israel, who were of Israel; and not them only,
but also the chosen ones among the Gentiles; who, with the former, make
up the whole Israel of God, in a spiritual and mystical sense: these are
the Israel, God has chosen, redeemed, and calls by his grace, and are
here styled his "servant", as Israel is frequently called, [Isa
41:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#008.md). The word signifies a "child", as
well as a "servant": and may design, either the weak and helpless
condition God's elect are in by nature, which calls for, and requires
divine help and assistance; or the relation they stand in to him, being
his adopted children, and which is the reason of his helping them: and
which signifies to take them by the hand, and lift them up, and support
and uphold them; and supposes them to have been fallen down, and unable
to raise themselves up; but God having laid help for them on one that is
mighty, sent him to take upon him their nature; and by obeying,
suffering, and dying for them, to help them out of their state of sin
and misery; and to uphold them with the right hand of his righteousness,
and bring them safe to glory; and all this,

in remembrance of his mercy; which he had in his heart towards them, and
had promised in his covenant to them: the mercy of God, is the spring
and source of redemption; mercy provided a Redeemer, and a ransom; and
it is owing to it, that the Redeemer came; and he, in his love and pity,
performed the work: and therefore salvation is to be ascribed, not to
works of righteousness done by men, but to the abundant mercy of God our
Saviour.

As he spake to our fathers,.... To David, of whose family Mary was; and
to Jacob, or Israel, of whose stock she was; and to Isaac, in whom the
seed was to be, called; and particularly,

to Abraham and to his seed for ever: not his natural, but his spiritual
seed; both among Jews and Gentiles, to the end of the world; to these
God promised this mercy of a Saviour and Redeemer, and to these he
performs it, and will to all generations.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">luk 1:56</span></span>

And Mary abode with her about three months,.... That is, she continued
with Elisabeth, as the Syriac and Persic versions express, about the
space of three months; in which time, she had full satisfaction of the
truth of the sign the angel had given her; namely, of Elisabeth's
conception and pregnancy, for by this time she was ready to give birth;
and she must now be fully assured, that she was with child herself: this
space of three months is a term of time fixed by the Jewish doctors, to
know whether a woman is with child or not, as in case of divorce or
death: the rule runs thus (k),

"every woman that is divorced, or becomes a widow, lo! she may not
marry, nor be betrothed, until she waits, , ninety days (i.e. three
months), exclusive of the day in which she is divorced, or her husband
dies, and of the day in which she is betrothed; that so it may be known
whether she is with child or not, in order to distinguish between the
seed of the former, and the seed of the second husband.

And so in the case of marrying the wife of a brother, that died without
issue (l), and of newly married couples mistaking their spouses (m):

and returned to her own house; at Nazareth, in Galilee; and now it was,
that Joseph, to whom she was betrothed, perceived she was with child;
and suspecting evil, had a mind to put her away privately; but was
informed by an angel of God, in a dream, of the whole matter; and was
advised and encouraged to take her to wife, which he accordingly did;
see [Mat 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#018.md).

Now Elisabeth's full time came,.... The nine months, which is the full
time of a woman's going with child, were now complete; for in the sixth
month of Elisabeth's pregnancy, or when she had been gone six months
with child, the angel acquainted Mary with it, and she had stayed about
three months with her; but now had left her, to shun the company which
would be at the delivery of her; though some think, she stayed till that
time was over, which is not so probable; and so her reckoning being out,
and the time come,

that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son, according to
the angel's prediction both to Zacharias and Mary, [Luk
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#013.md).

And her neighbours, and her cousins,.... That lived in Hebron, and the
parts adjacent, whether of the house of Aaron, or of the tribe of Judah;
to both which she was related, and who dwelt near her, the priests in
the city of Hebron, and the children of Judah in the places about it:

heard how the Lord had showed great mercy upon her; or "had magnified
his mercy with her"; see [Gen 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#019.md) in
removing her barrenness, and so taking away her reproach from among men;
in giving her strength to conceive, and bring forth a son, that was to
be so great, as the prophet of the Highest; and more than a prophet, and
greater than any born of women:

and they rejoiced with her: as the angel had foretold they should, [Luk
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#014.md) The Persic version reads, "with
him, Zacharias"; having rendered the other clause thus, though wrongly,
"hearing that God had poured out his mercy on the house of Zacharias";
see [Rom 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#015.md).

And it came to pass that on the eighth day,.... The precise time fixed
in the normal restitution of the ordinance of circumcision, [Gen
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#012.md) though this was not always
attended to, but circumcision was sometimes deferred to another time;
yet keeping the exact time was judged most commendable and praiseworthy;
see Gill on [Phi 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#005.md).

they came to circumcise the child; that is, the neighbours and cousins
of Elisabeth, who were at the time of her delivery; eight days after
they came again to be at the circumcision of the child: who was the
operator is not known; nor was there any particular person appointed for
this service; but any one might do it, whether ecclesiastic or laic, men
or women, father or mother, or any other friend; for the rule is (n),

"all are fit to circumcise; even an uncircumcised person, and a woman,
and a minor, may circumcise in a place where there is no man; but a
Gentile may not circumcise at all.

The circumcision of John seems to be performed in Zacharias's house, and
by one of those that came; for Zacharias, being dumb, could not say the
blessing which the circumciser was obliged to say: nor indeed could he
say that, which, as the father of the child, belonged to him; concerning
which, take the following account (o):

"the circumciser blesses before he circumcises, "saying", blessed is he
that hath sanctified us by his precepts, and hath commanded us
concerning circumcision: if he circumcises the son of his friend, or if
he circumcises his own son, he blesses him with "this blessing"; and
hath commanded us to circumcise a son: and the father of the son blesses
with another blessing; blessed art thou, O Lord our God, the King of the
world, who hath sanctified us by his precepts, and hath commanded us to
enter him into the covenant of Abraham our father.----If his father is
not there, they do not say this other blessing.----And if there are any
standing there, they say, as he hath brought him into the covenant, so
bring him to the law, and to matrimony, and to good works; and after
that the father of the child, or the circumciser, or one of those that
stand by, bless, "saying", blessed art thou, O Lord our God, the King of
the world, who sanctified the beloved (Isaac) from the womb, &c.

How many of Elisabeth's neighbours and relations were present at this
ceremony, is not related; but the Jews require ten persons as witnesses
of it; for they say (p), that "testimonies worthy of belief, in Israel,
are ten, the witnesses of the covenant of circumcision are ten, the
witnesses of a dead person ten, &c.

and at this time also it was usual to give the child a name, which was
not by divine appointment, but was a custom that prevailed among them;
which took its rise from Abraham, having his name changed at the time
when circumcision was enjoined him, [Gen
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#005.md) and from the naming and
circumcision of Isaac, mentioned together, .

and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father: as the
neighbours of Naomi gave a name to the son of Boaz and Ruth, calling him
Obed, [Rut 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#017.md). This they took upon
them to do, because that Zacharias was deaf and dumb; but why they
should call him by his name, cannot well be accounted for, it not being
usual to call the father, and the son, by the same name; unless they
were desirous of continuing the same name in the family, which had been
famous in Israel for a prophet, and a priest: to call children by
Gentile names was not lawful. In the Targum on [Amo
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001.md) it is said,

"woe to them that name their children after the names of the Gentiles.

And his mother answered and said,.... That is, Elisabeth:

not so, but he shall be called John; knowing that this was the name
wherewith the angel said he should be called; either by divine
revelation, she being filled with the Holy Ghost, [Luk
1:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#041.md) or by information of her husband,
who, doubtless, in writing, gave her an account of all that the angel
had said unto him.

[Luke 1:61](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#061.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_061">luk 1:61</span></span>

And they said unto her,.... Her neighbours and relations, there is none
of thy kindred that is called by this name; from whence it appears, that
it was usual to give names to children after their ancestors, relations,
and friends. The Persic version renders it, "in thine Israel there is
not any one of this name": but this could not be true; for the name of
Jochanan, or John, was a name very common among the Israelites, though
not in Elisabeth's family, or her husband's.

And they made signs to his father,.... Who was deaf, as well as dumb;
otherwise there would have been no occasion to have signs made to him:
and so the word used, in [Luk 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#020.md)
signifies both deaf and dumb. These signs were made by hands or head;
for such used to be made to a dumb man. According to the canon (q), a
dumb man nods, and "and is nodded", or "beckoned to": and which
beckoning one of the commentators (r) says, is a sign which is expressed
either by the hands or head. Such a method as these took with Zacharias,
about the name of his son, is directed to in case of a father's
deafness, in relation to knowing who is his firstborn; (s).

"father that is dumb, they search or examine him in the way they search
for divorces; if he makes signs, or writes, that this is his firstborn,
lo! this takes the double portion.

How he would have him called; by what name, Zacharias or John; and they
were right in applying to him, to whom it most properly belonged, to
give a name to his child,

And he asked for a writing table,.... That is, he made signs for one,
for as yet he could not speak. The Persic version renders it "ink", and
the Ethiopic, a book, and the Vulgate Latin, a notebook. The word
signifies "a little table", such as they used to write not only "upon",
but "in"; and was sometimes of brass (t), sometimes of wood, and
sometimes of wax (u), on which they wrote with a style or pen,

and wrote, saying, his name is John: not that he must be, or shall be,
so called; but this is his name, and no other; being what the angel had
given him before his conception, and Zacharias now confirms:

and they marvelled all; they were astonished, not so much at the new
name brought into the family, as at the agreement between Elisabeth and
Zacharias in this point, when the latter was both deaf and dumb; they
knowing nothing, as yet, of the angel's message to him,

And his mouth was opened immediately,.... As soon as ever the child was
named, and so all things accomplished which the angel had foretold,

and his tongue loosed; the impediments of speech were removed, and the
use of his tongue and lips was restored unto him:

and he spake and praised God; for the safe delivery of his wife; for the
birth of his son, the forerunner of Christ; for the conception of the
Messiah; for God's gracious regards to his church and people, in these
instances; and for the restoration of speech and hearing to himself, of

of God, an awful reverence of the divine majesty; they perceived the
hand of God was in these things, and that these were effects of divine
power; and which made very serious impressions upon their minds, and
they thought, and spoke of them with great solemnity; see [Act
2:43](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#043.md).

and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country
of Judea: the several things relating to the appearance of the angel to
Zacharias in the temple; his message to him; the striking him deaf and
dumb; the conception of Elisabeth, who had been barren; the birth of her
son; the unusual name given him; and the more unusual manner in which it
was given; and the opening of Zacharias's mouth, and the loosening of
his tongue upon this, were reported, and commonly talked of by all

And all they that heard them,.... The above things, laid them up in
their hearts; treasured them up in their memories, and often thought of
them in their minds, what should be the meaning, and what would be the
issue of them:

saying, what manner of child shall this be? what will he be, or come to?
and what is it that he shall do? surely he must be designed in
providence to be put into some high station, and some eminent work and
service; since so many, and such great things, have gone before, and
attended his birth:

and the hand of the Lord was with him; which may intend the special
care, and peculiar providence of God in preserving his life, giving him
health, causing him to grow strong and robust, and in stature of body,
and in endowments of mind; and also the communications of grace unto
him, and the gracious presence of God with him, so soon as he was
capable of enjoying them; as likewise a spirit of prophecy, which is
sometimes signified by the hand of the Lord; and the extraordinary gifts
of the Spirit, which, in process of time, appeared in him, qualifying
him for his high office and work: the hand of the Lord, with the Jews,
is the Holy Ghost: thus they interpret [Ch1

his incarnation and redemption by him; to the accomplishing of the
covenant, oath, promise and mercy of God to his people; and to his son,
the forerunner of Christ; and to his work and office, in the various
parts and branches of it, which he should perform. Whence it appears,
that the following song is of divine inspiration; and that Zacharias
spake it as he was moved by the Holy Ghost, as the prophets of old did.

Blessed be the Lord God of Israel,.... This was a form of blessing of
long standing, [Psa 72:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#018.md) and very
likely was in use, more or less, ever since Israel was distinguished
from other nations, became a body politic, and were settled in the land
of Canaan, in the enjoyment of peculiar privileges, both civil and
religious; see other forms before it in [Gen
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#026.md) and now, this was very near being
antiquated, and out of date; for upon the birth of Christ, the Son of
God manifest in the flesh, the New Testament form of blessing runs, as
in [Co2 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#003.md) The reason of its being
now made use of might be, because the Messiah, the principal subject of
this song, was peculiarly promised unto Israel, was raised up for them,
and sent unto them. To bless God, is not to invoke a blessing on him;
for there is none greater than he to ask one of; nor does he stand in
need of any, being the Creator, who is blessed for ever in himself, and
is the fountain of blessedness to his creatures: and therefore, also,
cannot signify to confer a blessing on him, but to praise and glorify
him, on account of the perfections of his nature, and the works of his
hands; and to give thanks unto him for all mercies, spiritual and
temporal; and especially for Jesus Christ, his mission, incarnation, and
salvation by him, which are the things the God of Israel is blessed for
in this song:

for he hath visited, and redeemed his people; as he did Israel of old,
[Exo 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#016.md) when the Lord looked upon
them, and delivered them out of the bondage of Egypt, and which was a
type and resemblance of redemption by Christ; and to which reference
here seems to be had. The "people" here said to be visited, and
redeemed, design all the elect of God, not only among the Jews, but
Gentiles also; all those whom God has chosen to be his people, and has
in his covenant taken and declared to be such; whom he has given to
Christ, as his people and portion; for whose sins he was stricken, and
made reconciliation, and whom he saves from their sins. The act of
"visiting" them, as previous to redemption, may include God's look of
love upon them from everlasting; his choice of them in Christ unto
salvation; the appointment and provision of a Saviour for them; the
covenant of grace made with them in Christ, the foundation and security
of their salvation; and particularly the mission of Christ in human
nature, in consequence of the council, covenant, and promise of God: or
it designs his incarnation, for he was now actually conceived in the
womb of the virgin: so that God had visited, and looked upon his people,
and remembered his love and mercy, his covenant and promise to them: and
the "redemption" of them, which was now said to be made, or done,
because Christ was now sent to do it, and because it was as sure, as if
it was done, intends the spiritual and eternal redemption of them by the
price of his blood, from the slavery of sin, the bondage of the law, and
curse of it, and the captivity of Satan, and a deliverance out of the
hands of every enemy; a redemption which reaches both to soul and body,
and secures from all condemnation and wrath to come; and includes every
blessing in it, as justification, forgiveness of sins, adoption,
sanctification, and eternal life; and is a plenteous, full, complete,
and everlasting one.

[Luke 1:69](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#069.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_069">luk 1:69</span></span>

And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us,.... Meaning the Messiah,
whom God had now raised up:

in the house of his servant David; in David's family, he being now
conceived by a virgin of his house; and who, in a little time, would be
born in Bethlehem, the city of David. He is called "an horn of
salvation", because he is a powerful Saviour. "Horn" denotes power; it
being that to a beast, as the arm is to a man, by which it defends
itself, and pushes down its enemies; and "salvation" is the work Christ
came to effect, and for which he was raised up, and sent: and a Saviour
he is, and a mighty one, as appears from his doing and suffering what he
has; as bearing all the sins of his people, and making reconciliation
for them; obeying all the precepts of the law, and undergoing the
penalty of it; being made a curse, and becoming obedient to death, even
the death of the cross: as also, from his delivering them from sin,
Satan, and the law, which no other could have done; and from his
grappling with, conquering, spoiling, and destroying all his, and our
enemies. Moreover, the word "horn" signifies regal power, honour, and
dignity; see [Dan 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#024.md) and so may not
only denote the work of Christ as a Saviour, but his office also as a
King, who in the discharge of that is likewise a Saviour; for he not
only rules, and governs, but protects, defends, and preserves his,
people, by his power; see [Sa1 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#010.md).

As he spake, by the mouth of his holy prophets,.... Which shows not only
the veracity and faithfulness of God in his promises, but the early
intimations that were given by him concerning the Messiah: for it
follows,

which have been since world began; or from the beginning of the world;
ever since the first hint of the Messiah, as the seed of the woman, that
should bruise the serpent's head, was given, he was more or less spoken
of. Adam, the first prophet, seems to have respect to him, when he calls
his wife Eve, which signifies life; and because she should be the mother
of all living. Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of him, of his
second coming, which supposes his first; and Lamech may be thought to
have some regard to him, when he named his son Noah, and said what he
did concerning him: Christ was spoken of to Abraham, as his seed, in
whom all nations of the earth should be blessed; and God spake of him by
the patriarch Jacob, under the name of Shiloh, as who should spring from
the tribe of Judah, before the sceptre and lawgiver were departed from
it. Moses foretold that there should arise a prophet from the midst of
his brethren like unto him, to whom the Israelites were to hearken.
David, the prophet, often speaks of him, particularly of his death, his
resurrection from the dead, his ascension to heaven, and session at
God's right hand; and the evangelical prophet Isaiah predicts his birth
of a virgin, and testified beforehand of the sufferings of Christ, and
the glory that should follow. Micah points out the very place of his
birth; and Zechariah describes the manner of his entrance into
Jerusalem, as riding on an ass: to say nothing of what Jeremiah,
Ezekiel, Daniel, and others, have prophesied of him, It is a common
saying of the Jews (x), that "all the prophets, all of them prophesied
not, "but of the days of the Messiah."

The men, by whom God spoke of the Messiah, of the mission of him, and of
raising up this horn of salvation, for his people, were "prophets"; men
endued with a spirit of prophecy; "holy", men, who were sanctified by
the Holy Ghost, and spake, as they were moved by him; and these all
spake as if it were with one "mouth"; they all agree in their accounts
concerning Christ, though they lived in different periods of time, from
the beginning of the world,

That we should be saved from our enemies,.... This, and the two
following verses, either contain and express the sum and substance of
what God spake by the prophets; or point out the end or ends of his
raising up an horn of salvation, or a Saviour for his people; namely,
that they should be saved by him from their enemies: from sin, which
wars against the soul, and threatens the destruction of it; from Satan,
the avowed and implacable adversary of mankind; from the world, the seed
of the serpent, which has always bore an enmity to the seed of the
woman; from the law, the killing letter; and from death, the last enemy
that is to be destroyed,

and from the hand of all that hate us: which is only an illustration of

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_072">luk 1:72</span></span>

To perform the mercy promised to our fathers,.... By "mercy" is meant
salvation by Christ, which springs from the mercy of God; the promise of
which was an instance of mercy to the Jewish fathers under the Old
Testament, and also the performance of it; for they were saved by the
grace of our Lord Jesus, even as we: his blood was shed for the
remission of sins that were past, and for the redemption of
transgressions under the first Testament:

and to remember his holy covenant; which was made between him, and his
Son from all eternity; and was, at various times, dispensed and
manifested to the patriarchs, and eminent saints, as Adam, Noah,
Abraham, &c. This is called an "holy" one; not only because it was made
by, and between holy persons, and provided for the holiness of the
people of God, both here, and hereafter; but because in the article of
redemption and salvation by Christ, which is here more particularly
regarded, care was taken to secure the glory of God's holiness and
justice, as well as to display his grace and mercy. Now raising up, and
sending Jesus a Saviour, showed, that God was mindful of this covenant,
and therefore sent redemption to his people.

[Luke 1:73](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#073.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_073">luk 1:73</span></span>

The oath which he swore to our father Abraham. When he swore by himself,
because he could swear by no greater, that in blessing he would bless
him; that his seed should possess the gates of his enemies, and in it
all the nations of the earth should be blessed: all which have been
fulfilled in Jesus the Messiah; see [Gen
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#016.md).

[Luke 1:74](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#074.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_074">luk 1:74</span></span>

That he would grant unto us,.... What is said in this and the following
verse, is the substance of the promised mercy, covenant, and oath:

that we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, as before, in
[Luk 1:71](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#071.md).

might serve him without fear. One principal end of deliverance from
spiritual enemies by Christ, is the service of God; and nothing lays a
greater obligation on men to serve the Lord, and glorify him, than
redemption by Christ; nor is there any thing that makes men more zealous
of good works: spiritual and evangelical service, in distinction from
the legal service, and worship of God, is here meant; since it is said
to be "without fear", which the threatenings and curses of the law
filled men with; but being delivered from it, they become free from that
spirit of bondage unto fear, it genders to; as being delivered also from
sin and Satan, they are without fear of hell and damnation; and from the
world, they are without fear of men; and from death, they are without
fear of that, through which many under the legal dispensation, were all
their lifetime subject to bondage. It is a saying of the Jews (y), that:

"greater is he that serves from love, than he that serves from fear.

But such sort of service is not of a man's self, or performed by his own
power and strength, but is a "grant" from God, and owing to the
influence of his Spirit and grace,

[Luke 1:75](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#075.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_075">luk 1:75</span></span>

In holiness and righteousness,...., Not in mere outward rites and legal
ceremonies but as the saints serve, from principles of righteousness and
true holiness; in which the new man is created, and of which the kingdom
of God, or spiritual and internal religion consists; so in acts of piety
and devotion towards God, and justice among men, which is the substance
of the perfect and acceptable will of God:

before him; it is one thing to serve the Lord with an outward appearance
of holiness and righteousness before men, and another thing to be
righteous before God, and to walk in all his commandments and
ordinances, as in his sight: all the days of our life; which denotes the
constancy and continuance of this service; it is not for a day or two,
or only on festivals and sabbath days, such as were under the Jewish
dispensation, but every day we live. In the Vulgate Latin, Syriac,
Persic, and Ethiopic versions, and in two copies of Beza's, and two of
Stephens's, and in the Alexandrian copy, it is only read, "all our
days"; but the Arabic version reads, as the generality of copies, and as
we render it.

[Luke 1:76](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#076.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_076">luk 1:76</span></span>

And thou, child, shalt be called the Prophet of the Highest,.... Here
Zacharias turns himself to his son John, though an infant, and incapable
of knowing what was said to him; and for the sake of those that were
present, describes his office and work; and says, that he should be
"called", that is, that he should "be", and be accounted a "prophet":
for he was not only a preacher of Christ and his Gospel, but he also
foretold the coming of the Messiah; and the vengeance that should fall
on the Jewish nation, for their unfruitfulness, impenitence, and
unbelief: and the Prophet "of the Highest"; that is, of God; as the
Persic version renders it, of the most high God; and by whom is meant,
the Lord Jesus Christ, whose prophet, harbinger, and forerunner John
was; and so is a proof of Christ being the supreme, or most high God:

for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord, to prepare his ways; as
the angel had suggested in [Luk 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#017.md)
and as was prophesied of him in [Isa
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#003.md). See Gill on [Mat
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#003.md).

[Luke 1:77](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#077.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_077">luk 1:77</span></span>

To give knowledge of salvation,.... This is still said of John, and
belongs to his work and office; though the Syriac and Arabic versions
read, "that he may give"; as if it was spoken of the Lord, before whose
face John was to go, and whose ways he was to prepare: by "salvation" is
meant, not a temporal salvation, or a deliverance from the Roman yoke,
the Jews were expecting, for John gave no intimation of any such
salvation; but of a spiritual and eternal salvation, and of Christ
himself, the author of it; who is often called Salvation, because he was
appointed to this business, was fitted for it, and has effected it; and
there is salvation in him, and in no other, the "knowledge" of this is
not merely, notional and speculative, but experimental, approbative,
fiducial, appropriating, sure, and certain; and is more excellent, than
any other kind of knowledge whatever: and this is a "gift"; it is not
what is attained unto, and acquired by application, diligence, and
industry, as other sort of knowledge; but is a gift of God, though in
the use of means, and through the ministry of the word: and so John is
said to give it ministerially, he being an instrument in the hand of
God, whereby souls came to the knowledge of salvation by Christ, and
believed in him: it was communicated by God through his ministry,

unto his people: meaning not the people of John the Baptist, the Jews,
though it was true of God's elect among them; but the people of Christ,
and that not all mankind, who are his by creation; but a special people,
whom the Father has given him, and he has purchased by his blood; whom
he conquers by his grace, and makes a willing people, in the day of his
power: to these, and only these, is the knowledge of salvation by Christ
given; for none else are appointed to it, and for no other is it wrought
out. It follows,

by the remission of their sins; the sense of which is, either that
salvation is by the forgiveness of sin, and lies in it, that being a
principal part of it; see [Eph 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#007.md).
Sins are debts; forgiving them is a remitting these debts, a loosing
them, or the obligation to payment, which is done freely and fully, for
Christ's sake, and through his blood; and herein lies the blessedness
and salvation of men; see [Rom 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#006.md). Or
else that the knowledge of salvation was conveyed through the ministry
of John, not by preaching the works of the law, but the doctrine of
remission of sins, by Christ; [Mar 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#004.md)
and which is the sum and substance of the Gospel, as it was ordered to
be preached by Christ, and was preached by his apostles. The Alexandrian
copy reads, "our sins".

[Luke 1:78](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#078.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_078">luk 1:78</span></span>

Through the tender mercy of our God,.... or "bowels of mercy", to which
the forgiveness of sin is owing; the source and spring of pardon, is the
free grace and abundant mercy of God; it takes its rise from thence,
though it is channelled in the blood and sacrifice of Christ; and which
no way derogates from, but rather heightens the riches of God's grace
and mercy: for it was mercy that moved God to enter into a covenant with
his Son, in which forgiveness of sin is promised; and it was mercy to
set forth his Son, in his eternal purposes and decrees; and to send him
forth in the fulness of time, to shed his blood for the remission of
sins; it was the mercy of God to us, that provided a lamb for a burnt
offering, and then accepted of the sacrifice and satisfaction of his
Son, in our room and stead, and forgave all our sins, for his sake; and
whatever the pardon of our sins cost God and Christ, it is all free
grace and mercy to us: it is owing not to the absolute mercy of God, or
to the mercy of God as an absolute God, but to the mercy of "our" God;
our God in Christ, our covenant God and Father, whose bowels yearned
towards us, and whose pity is that of a tender parent: whereby

the day spring from on high hath visited us: the word here used, and is
translated "the day spring", is the same which the Septuagint use, in
[Jer 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005.md) where the Messiah is spoken
of, under the name of the "branch": and undoubtedly the Messiah Jesus,
is intended here, who is the man, that branch, that has grown up out of
his place; not from below, but from above; and who is the phosphorus, or
bringer of light, that bright and morning star, that sun of
righteousness, who has light in himself, and communicates light to
others; even light natural, spiritual, and eternal; and with his rays
and beams of light, life, and love, refreshes, exhilarates, and warms,
the hearts of his people: and by the "visit" he has made in our
"horizon", is meant his assumption of human nature; which, like a
friendly visit, proceeded from pure love to the children of God; and was
a drawing near unto them, for it was a taking on him their nature, in
which he represented their persons; and was done through much difficulty
and great condescension, since he was in the form of God, and thought it
no robbery to be equal with him; and his stay on earth in this nature,
was but for a little while; so that on all accounts, it may be truly
called a "visit": and which, as the remission of sin is wholly owing to
the tender mercy of our God, who put him upon it, called him to it, sent
him forth made of a woman, and in the likeness of sinful flesh, to
obtain eternal redemption, in which mercy and truth met together: the
end and design of this visit, are signified in the next verse; for the
following words belong to the day spring from on high, and not to John
the Prophet of the Highest.

To give light to them that sit in darkness,.... God's elect among the
Jews, who were not only in a state of unregeneracy, which is a state of
darkness, ignorance, and unbelief; but in the darkness of the legal
dispensation, and at this time under more than ordinary darkness and
ignorance; having lost the knowledge of the righteousness of God, and of
the spirituality of his law, the true sense of the Scriptures, and right
notions of the Messiah; being led by blind guides, the Scribes and
Pharisees,

and, were as it were also,

in the shadow of death; in a state seemingly irrecoverable, when Christ,
the great light arose, and shone upon them; and communicated spiritual
light, life, and heat unto them; see [Isa
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#002.md) compared with [Mat
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#013.md) though Christ is also a light, to
lighten his chosen ones among the Gentiles, [Luk
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#032.md) but the Jews seem chiefly to be
intended here:

to guide our feet into the way of peace; which we knew not: not that he
came to teach us how to make our peace with God, but to make peace for
us, by the blood of his cross; and so by his Spirit and word, lead us
into the true way of enjoying spiritual peace here, and eternal peace
hereafter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_080">luk 1:80</span></span>

And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit,.... That is, John, the
son of Zacharias and Elisabeth, grew in stature of body, and increased
in wisdom and knowledge, and fortitude in his soul:

and was in the deserts; or "desert", as the Syriac, Persic, and Ethiopic
versions read; not in the wilderness of Judea, where he came preaching,
but either of Ziph or Maon, which were near to Hebron; see [Sa1
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#014.md) he was not brought up in the
schools of the prophets, nor in the academies of the Jews, or at the
feet of any of their Rabbins and doctors; that it might appear he was
not taught and sent of men, but of God: nor did he dwell in any of the
cities, or larger towns, but in deserts; partly that he might be fitted
for that gravity and austerity of life, he was to appear in; and that it
might be clear he had no knowledge of, nor correspondence with Jesus,
whose forerunner he was, and of whom he was to bear testimony, till such
time he did it; and in this solitude he remained,

till the day of his showing unto Israel; either till the time came that
he was to appear before, and be examined by the sanhedrim, that judged
of persons fitness and qualifications for the priesthood, in order to be
admitted to it; which should have been when he was thirty years of age,
but that he was designed for other service; or rather therefore till he
appeared in his prophetic office, and showed himself to the people of
Israel; to whom he came preaching the doctrine of repentance and
remission of sins, administering the ordinance of baptism, giving notice
of the near approach of the Messiah, and pointing him out unto the
people.
