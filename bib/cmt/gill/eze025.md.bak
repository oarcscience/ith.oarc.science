[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

INTRODUCTION TO EZEKIEL 25

In this chapter the prophet foretells the judgments of God upon the
Ammonites, Moabites, Edomites, and Philistines, for their ill usage of
the Jews; on the Ammonites, [Eze 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#001.md),
on the Moabites, [Eze 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#008.md), on the
Edomites, [Eze 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#012.md), on the
Philistines, [Eze 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#015.md).

[Ezekiel 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 25:1</span></span>

The word of the Lord came unto me,.... After he had done prophesying to
the Jews, he is bid to prophesy against the Gentiles, the nations that
lay nearest the Jews:

saying; as follows:

[Ezekiel 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 25:2</span></span>

Son of man, set thy face against the Ammonites,.... Who were of the
posterity of Lot, implacable enemies of the Jews; who hated their
religion, and envied their wealth and happiness; against these the
prophet is bid to "set his face"; to look that way where they lived, and
to put on a frowning countenance, and a menacing aspect: "strengthen thy
face", as the Septuagint and Arabic versions render it; look boldly at
them:

and prophesy against them; deliver out the following prophecy concerning
them.

[Ezekiel 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 25:3</span></span>

And say unto the Ammonites,.... Either to their ambassadors at Babylon,
or merchants there; or by letters to them, the prophet being in Chaldea,
at a distance from them:

hear the word of the Lord God; not Chemosh their idol, nor their lying
oracles, but the word of the true and living God; which is always
accomplished, and is never frustrated:

thus saith the Lord God, because thou saidst, aha, against my sanctuary,
when it was profaned; that is, expressed joy, as the Targum paraphrases
it, at the destruction of the temple, when it was burnt by
Nebuchadnezzar; it was foreknown by the Lord that they would do so, and
are here threatened before hand; for as yet the temple was not
destroyed; a proof this of God's prescience of future contingencies:

and against the land of when it was desolate; the country of the ten
tribes, which had been desolate from the sixth year of Hezekiah, when
the people of it were carried captive by Shalmaneser king of Assyria;
this also was matter of joy to the Ammonites:

and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity; the two
tribes of Judah and Benjamin, who were carried captive by
Nebuchadnezzar; part of which had already been carried captive under
Jeconiah, and the rest would be, and were, under Zedekiah; which
completed the destruction of Israel and Judah, and gave the utmost
pleasure to their enemies the Ammonites; who were so impious as to
rejoice at the destruction of their temple, the place of their religious
worship, which they abhorred; and so inhuman as to express the delight
and satisfaction they had in the ruin of their fellow creatures and
neighbours, and who were originally related to them; this brutish and
barbarous behaviour of theirs is resented by the Lord.

[Ezekiel 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 25:4</span></span>

Behold, therefore, I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a
possession,.... The Chaldeans and Syrians, which were on the east side,
as Jarchi; or the Medes and Persians, as Kimchi, which lay more
eastward; or it may be the Arabians, who are commonly called the men of
the east; who were a part of Nebuchadnezzar's army, and whom he might
reward with this country, when taken by him; for this prophecy,
according to Josephus (q), was fulfilled five years after the
destruction of Jerusalem:

and they shall set their palaces in thee, and make their dwellings in
thee; or, "their camps and their tents" (r); and so the Syriac version
renders it, their armies and their tents; who should subdue them, and
take possession of their cities and fields, and enjoy what they found
there:

they shall eat thy fruit, and drink thy milk; the fruit of their land,
their vineyards and fields, and the milk of their flocks and herds,
which was commonly drank in those countries; these are put for the whole
of their substance. So the Targum,

"they shall eat the good of thy land, and spoil thy substance.''

[Ezekiel 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 25:5</span></span>

And I will make Rabbath a stable for camels,.... Creatures much used by
the eastern nations, especially the Arabians; who pitching their tents
about Rabbath, the royal city, the metropolis of the children of Ammon,
would convert the houses, and even palaces in it, into stables for their
camels. This city, in Jerom's time, as he says, was called Philadelphia,
from Ptolemy Philadelphus, who rebuilt it.

And the Ammonites a couching place for flocks; that is, the land of the
Ammonites should be made a place for flocks of sheep to lie down in,
which the Arabians would bring and feed upon it:

and ye shall know that I am the Lord; omniscient, and sees and observes
all your insults upon the children of Israel and Judah; and omnipotent,
able to perform all that is threatened; and immutable, bringing about
all that is here prophesied of.

[Ezekiel 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 25:6</span></span>

For thus saith the Lord God,.... Their sin and punishment are further
enlarged upon:

because thou hast clapped thine hands, and stamped with thy feet:
gestures expressive of joy and gladness, [Isa
55:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#012.md), the Ammonites clapped their
hands together, and leaped and skipped for joy, when they heard of the
calamities of the Jews; who yet had more reason to be sorrowful, since
they might expect their turn would be next; for the king of Babylon had
a design against them, at the same time he came against Jerusalem, and
was in doubt for a while which he should attack first; see [Eze
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#020.md),

and rejoiced in heart with all thy despite against the land of Israel;
they had a secret joy in their heart, which they expressed by gestures,
in the most spiteful and scornful manner they were capable of; which
showed the wretched malignity of their dispositions against the children
of Israel; they hated them with a perfect hatred.

[Ezekiel 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 25:7</span></span>

Behold, therefore, I will stretch out mine hand upon thee,.... In just
retaliation for clapping their hands against his people; and which hand
of the Lord they would find to be a heavy one, and which they would not
be able either to resist or bear. The Targum is,

"I will lift up the stroke of my power upon thee:''

and will deliver thee for a spoil to the Heathen; to the Chaldeans
first, and then to the Arabians, to be spoiled and plundered by them of
their wealth and substance: some render it, "for meat" (s) unto them; to
be devoured and consumed by them:

and I will cut thee off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish
out of the countries; so as to be no more a people and a country; or be
reckoned among the people and countries; or have any alliance with them,
or help from them:

I will destroy thee, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord; who has
said and done all this; See Gill on [Eze
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#005.md).

\(s\) "in cibum", Montanus, Gussetius. This is the Cetib or textual
writing; but the Keri or marginal reading is "in direptionem", Pagninus,
Cocceius; "in praedam", Junius & Tremeilius, Piscator. Both come to much
one and the same sense, as Ben Melech observes, for food was of the
spoil; and one word answers to another by "athbash", which is a certain
form of placing the alphabet; See Gill on

[Ezekiel 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 25:8</span></span>

Thus saith the Lord God,.... By his servant the prophet, to whom the
word of the Lord came; as concerning the Ammonites, so likewise
concerning the Moabites, as follows:

because that Moab and Seir do say; that is, the Moabites, and the
Edomites, which latter are meant by Seir, that being the seat of them;
these lived near one another, and bore a like enmity to the Israelites
and Jews, and had the same sentiments concerning them, and said the same
things of them: only Moab is mentioned in the Septuagint and Arabic
versions: the Moabites are first prophesied of, and then the Edomites,
who both joined in saying, behold, the house of Judah is like unto all
the Heathen; it fares no better with them than with the rest of the
nations, who do not profess and serve the same God they do; they are
fallen into the hands of the king of Babylon, as well as others; and
have no more security against him, nor protection from him, than other
people; they pretend to serve and worship the one only living and true
God, and to be his covenant people, and to be favoured with privileges
above all other nations; and yet are brought into the same miserable
circumstances, and left in them, as others are; where is the God they
boast of, and their superior excellence to the rest of the world? thus
blasphemously, as well as wickedly, did they insult them, which was
provoking to the Lord. The Targum renders it interrogatively,

in what do the house of Judah differ from all people?''

and so the Septuagint,

"behold, are not the house of Israel and Judah in like manner as all
nations?''

Jerom, on the place, relates a fable of the Jews, that when the city and
temple were opened, the Ammonites, Moobites, and Edomites, went into the
temple, and saw the cherubim over the mercy seat, and said, as all
nations worship images, so Judah hath the idols of their religion.
Jarchi makes mention of such a Midrash, but with some difference.

[Ezekiel 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 25:9</span></span>

Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities,.... Or,
"the shoulder of Moab" (t); that part of their country where their
greatest strength lay, So the Targum renders it,

"the strength of Moab;''

where their principal cities were, their frontier towns, and fortified
places, as appears by what follows:

from his cities which are on his frontiers; or, "from his Ars" (u),

from his cities which are at his end; at the extreme part of the land,
upon the borders of his countries; the two cities of Ar and Aroer, [Num
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#028.md),

the glory of the country; as the above cities were, and what follow:

Bethjeshimoth; this was formerly in the tribe of Reuben, now in the
possession of the Moabites, and one of their principal cities, [Jos
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#020.md),

Baalmeon; the same with Bethbaalmeon, and which was also of the tribe of
Reuben, [Jos 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#017.md), in Jerom's time it
was a large village in Moab, about nine miles from Heshbon: some think
by Meon is meant Menes, or Osiris the god of the Egyptians, and so this
might be a temple of his; or at least he might have a temple in it, from
whence it had its name:

and Kirjathaim; or the double city, built also by the Reubenites, [Num
32:37](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#037.md), now in the hands of the
Moabites, ten miles from Medeba; on this side of the country of Moab,
and through these cities, the Lord threatens to open a way for their
enemies to enter in and destroy them, as follows:

\(t\) , Sept.; "humerum", V. L. Montanus. (u) "ab ipsis", Haris, Junius
& Tremellius, Polanus.

[Ezekiel 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 25:10</span></span>

Unto the men of the east with the Ammonites, and I will give them in
possession,.... Or, "against the Ammonites", as the Targum; that is, way
should be made for the same people of the east, the Chaldeans or
Arabians, that came against the Ammonites and destroyed them, to enter
into the land of Moab and possess it, as they had done the land of
Ammon:

that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations: the name of
that people, which is entirely lost; and Moab likewise, which underwent
the same fate.

[Ezekiel 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 25:11</span></span>

I will execute judgments upon Moab,.... For though the Chaldeans and
Arabians were the instruments of their ruin, their destruction was of
the Lord; it was his hand that was upon them, and his vengeance that was
executed on them, for their hard sayings against his people; for though
he had spoke against them in his providence, and chastised them for
their sins, yet he will not suffer others to speak against them:

and they shall know that I am the Lord; that takes part with Judah, and
will avenge himself of all their enemies.

[Ezekiel 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 25:12</span></span>

Thus saith the Lord God,.... Concerning Seir or the Edomites, the
prophecy concerning the Moabites being finished:

because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking
vengeance: or, "revenging a revenge" (w); the Edomites bore an old
grudge against the Jews, not only because their father Jacob had got the
birthright and blessing from their father Esau; but because they were
made tributaries to them in David's time, and afterwards severely
chastised by Amaziah; these things they laid up in their minds, and
vowed revenge whenever they had an opportunity; and now one offered at
the destruction of Jerusalem, which they took:

and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them: not only by
rejoicing at the destruction of the Jews, but by encouraging the
Babylonians in it; assisting them therein, joining with them in
plundering the city, and in cutting off those with the sword who
endeavoured to make their escape; see [Psa
137:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007.md).

\(w\) "in ulciscendo ultionem", Montanus, Starckius.

[Ezekiel 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 25:13</span></span>

Therefore thus saith the Lord God,.... Because of such base and
barbarous usage, from a people that were originally brethren:

I will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and
beast from it; by the army of Nebuchadnezzar, by the sword of the
Chaldeans, and by famine and pestilence, and such like sore judgments;
in which the hand of God is manifestly seen:

and I will make it desolate from Teman; a very principal city of Edom,
so called from Teman, the son of Eliphaz, the son of Esau, [Gen
36:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#015.md) it lay in the south of the land
of Idumea; the Targum renders it, "from the south":

and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword; of the Babylonians; this was
another city of Edom, it lay in the north of that country; so that
hereby is signified that destruction should go through it from the
southern to the northern parts of it.

[Ezekiel 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 25:14</span></span>

And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by fie hand of my people
Israel,.... This was fulfilled in the times of the Maccabees, when Judas
Maccabins overthrew and conquered them,

"Then Judas fought against the children of Esau in Idumea at Arabattine,
because they besieged Gael: and he gave them a great overthrow, and
abated their courage, and took their spoils.'' (1 Maccabees 5:3)

and when Hyrcanus took their cities, and subdued them, and they became
Jews, as Josephus (x) relates; though Kimchi thinks this refers to
future time, and is yet to be accomplished; and it is, by the ancient
Jews (y), understood of the times of the Messiah: some choose to
understand the phrase,

by the hand of my people Israel, the same hand by which judgment was
inflicted upon Israel; suggesting that by the same hand vengeance would
be inflicted on the Edomites, namely, by the Babylonians:

and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my
fury; that is, shall execute all the anger and fury, or all that
punishment in anger and fury, which the Lord in righteous judgment has
appointed them to, and has determined shall be performed upon them, by
the children of Israel or the Babylonians, as his instruments:

and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord God; the meaning is,
they shall feel it, and be sensible of it, and know that it comes from
the Lord himself; full of resentment against them, and highly displeased
at their behaviour towards his people Israel.

\(x\) Antiqu. l. 13. c. 9. sect. 1. (y) In Bemidbar Rabba, sect. 2. fol.
179. 3.

[Ezekiel 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 25:15</span></span>

Thus saith the Lord God,.... Once more, and concerning another enemy of
the people of Israel, and who had been of old an implacable one:

because the Philistines have dealt by revenge: for what they suffered in
the times of Saul, when Goliath was slain by David, and their army was
discomfited; and for the overthrow of them by David, when he came to
throne; and for his burning their images, and subduing them, [Sa1
17:51](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#051.md), this revenge they took in the
time of Ahaz, [Ch2 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#018.md), and very
probably also showed their spite at the time of Jerusalem's destruction:

and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy it for the
old hatred; which they bore to the people of Israel, from their first
settlement in Canaan; from the times of the judges, particularly Samson;
and from the times of Saul and David: it was an old grudge they bore,
they had spite and malice in their hearts, and wanted an opportunity to
vent it; having determined to take vengeance when they could, and
utterly destroy them from being a people; very likely, through despite,
they assisted the Chaldean army: or, this they did "with a perpetual
hatred" (z); they did everything they could, in a spiteful and malicious
way, to perpetuate the hatred between them and Israel.

\(z\) "inimictias perpetuas", Pagninus; "iuimietia perpetua", Junius &
Tremellius, Piscator.

[Ezekiel 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 25:16</span></span>

Therefore thus saith the Lord God,.... Because of such wretched malice
and despiteful usage:

behold, I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines; as is
foretold, [Jer 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#001.md),

and I will cut off the Cherethims: one of the tribes of the Philistines,
a principal part of their country, which lay to the south, [Sa1
30:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#014.md), there is a beautiful play on
words (i) in the Hebrew:

and destroy the remnant of the seacoast; as that of Ashdod, Caphtor, and
Ashkelon, formerly spoiled by other persons; what they left should now
be utterly destroyed; see [Isa 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001.md).

\(a\) .

[Ezekiel 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 25:17</span></span>

And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes,....
By way of retaliation for their vengeance and fury, wrath and malice,
against his people; suggesting, that the judgments inflicted on them,
for quantity and quality, should be very great:

and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall lay my vengeance
upon them; they shall see the hand of God in it, acknowledge his
justice, and confess that their gods were idols, and that the God of
Israel is the only true God.
