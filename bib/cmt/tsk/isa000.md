### [Isaiah Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 0:0</span></span>

Isaiah has, with singular propriety, been denominated the Evangelical
Prophet, on account of the number and variety of his prophecies
concerning the advent and character, the ministry and preaching, the
sufferings and death, and the extensive and permanent kingdom of the
Messiah. So explicit and determinate are his predictions, as well as so
numerous, that he seems to speak rather of things past than of events
yet future; and he may be rather called an evangelist than a prophet.
Though later critics, especially those on the continent, have expended
much labour and learning in order to rob the prophet of his title; yet
no one, whose mind is unprejudiced, can be at a loss in applying select
portions of these prophecies to the mission and character of Jesus
Christ, and to the events in his history which they are cited to
illustrate by the sacred writers of the New Testament. In fact, his
prophecies concerning the Messiah seem almost to anticipate the Gospel
history; so clearly do they predict his Divine character. (Compare [Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014.md) with [Mat
1:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#018.md), and [Luk
1:27-35](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#027.md); see [Isa

7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014.md), [Isa
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#015.md); [Isa
53:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#003).md); his sufferings for our sins
([Isa 50:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#006.md); [Isa
53:4-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004).md); his death and burial ([Isa
53:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#008.md), [Isa
53:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#009).md); his victory over death ([Isa
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#008.md); [Isa
53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010.md), [Isa
53:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012).md); his final glory ([Isa
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#007.md), [Isa
49:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#022.md), 33; [Isa
52:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#013.md); [Isa
53:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004.md), [Isa
53:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#005).md); and the establishment,
increase, and perfection of his kingdom ([Isa
2:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002.md); [Isa
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#002.md), [Isa
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007.md); [Isa
11:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004.md); [Isa
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#005.md); [Isa
29:18-24](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#018.md); [Isa

42:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#004.md); [Isa
46:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#013.md); [Isa
49:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#009.md); [Isa
51:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#003.md); [Isa
53:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#006.md); [Isa
55:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001.md); [Isa
59:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#016.md); 60; [Isa
61:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md); [Isa
65:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#025).md); each specifically pointed out,
and pourtrayed with the most striking and discriminating characters. It
is impossible, indeed, to reflect on these, and on the whole chain of
his illustrious prophecies, and not be sensible that they furnish the
most incontestable evidence in support of Christianity. The style of
Isaiah has been universally admired as the most perfect model of
elegance and sublimity; and as distinguished for all the magnificence,
and for all the sweetness of the Hebrew language.
