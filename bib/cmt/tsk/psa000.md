The Psalms have been the general song of the universal Church; and in
their praise, all the Fathers have been unanimously eloquent. Men of all
nations find in these compositions a language at once suitable to their
feelings, and expressive of their highest joys and deepest sorrows, as
well as of all the endlessly varied wishes and desires of their hearts.
Whether the pious believer is disposed to indulge the exalted sentiments
of praise and thanksgiving towards the ALMIGHTY FATHER of his being; to
pour out his soul in penitence or prayer; to bewail, with tears of
contrition, past offences; to magnify the goodness and mercy of GOD; to
dwell with ecstacy on the divine attributes of wisdom and omnipotence;
or to rejoice in the coming of the MESSIAH, the Psalms afford him the
most perfect models for expressing all his feelings.
