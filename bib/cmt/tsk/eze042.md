### [Ezekiel Chapter 42](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#001)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 42:0</span></span>

Overview

[Eze 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#001), The chambers for the
priests; [Eze 42:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#013), The use thereof;
[Eze 42:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#015), The measures of the
outward court.

[Ezekiel 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 42:1</span></span>

he brought: [Eze 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#002), [Eze
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#003), [Eze
40:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#024), [Eze
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#001)

the utter court: [Eze 40:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#020); [Rev
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#002)

chamber: This seems to denote a row of chambers in three stories; which
appear to have been situated in the inner court (here called the outer
court in reference to the temple, [Eze
42:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#013), [Eze
42:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#014)), just before the separate
place, at the entrance from the north. [Eze
42:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#004), [Eze
41:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#009), [Eze
41:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#012)

[Ezekiel 42:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 42:2</span></span>

Before: Perhaps this means, that the north door was 100 cubits from the
entrance into the court; and that the door-way, or portico, was 50
cubits in length; or, that it faced one of the cloisters, the length of
which was 100 cubits, and its breadth 50, which was the proportion of
all the cloisters. [Eze 42:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#002)

[Ezekiel 42:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 42:3</span></span>

Over: One side of these buildings looked upon the void space about the
temple of twenty cubits, and the other toward the pavement belonging to
the outer court.

the twenty: [Eze 41:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#010)

the pavement: [Eze 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#017), [Eze
40:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#018); [Ch2
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#003)

gallery against: [Eze 41:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#015), [Eze
41:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#016); [Sol
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#017), [Sol
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#005)

[Ezekiel 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 42:4</span></span>

before: These seems to have been two rows of these chambers, and a walk
between of ten cubits in width; with an entrance into it from the
chambers, of one cubit in width.

a walk: [Eze 42:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#011)

a way: [Mat 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#014); [Luk
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#024)

were higher than these: or, did eat of these, [Eze
41:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#007)

than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building: or, and the
building consisted of the lower and the middlemost. [Eze
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#006)

[Ezekiel 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 42:6</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 42:8</span></span>

before: Passing from the north to the south side of the temple ([Eze
42:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#011), [Eze
42:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#012)), the prophet was shewn that the
space of ground, which was before the temple on the east, measured 100
cubits. [Eze 42:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#008)

[Ezekiel 42:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 42:9</span></span>

from under: or, from the place of, [Eze
46:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#019)

as one goeth: or, as he came

[Ezekiel 42:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 42:10</span></span>

the thickness: Rather, "the breadth of the wall," that is, the breadth
of ground which it enclosed. [Eze
41:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#012)

over against: These south chambers were exactly like those on the north.

side: Heb. wind

the measuring reed: Estimating the reed at 10+ feet, 500 reeds will be
nearly equal to a mile; so that from this statement we find the temple,
with its outbuildings, was built on a square, nearly an English mile on
each side, and four miles in circumference. This not only far exceeds
the size of Solomon's temple, or that after the captivity, which was
only 500 cubits, or a furlong, on each side, and exactly half a mile in
circuit; but is nearly equal to the whole extent of Jerusalem itself,
which, when greatest, was but 33 furlongs in circumference, somewhat
less than 4+ miles. This seems clearly to intimate, that the vision
cannot be explained of any temple that has hitherto been built, or
indeed of any literal temple, but figuratively and mystically of the
spiritual temple, the church under the gospel, and its spiritual glory.
