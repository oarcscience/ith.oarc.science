[Matthew](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md)

Matthew, being one of the twelve apostles, and early called to the
apostleship, and from the time of his call a constant attendant on our
Saviour, was perfectly well qualified to write fully the history of his
life. He relates what he saw and heard. "He is eminently distinguished
for the distinctness and particularity with which he has related many of
our Lord's discourses and moral instructions. Of these his sermon on the
mount, his charge to the apostles, his illustrations of the nature of
his kingdom, and his prophecy on mount Olivet, are examples. He has also
wonderfully united simplicity and energy in relating the replies of his
Master to the cavils of his adversaries." "There is not," as Dr. A.
Clarke justly remarks, "one truth or doctrine, in the whole oracles of
God, which is not taught in this Evangelist. The outlines of the whole
spiritual system are here correctly laid down. even Paul himself has
added nothing. He has amplified and illustrated the truths contained in
this Gospel - under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, neither he, nor
any of the other apostles, have brought to light one truth, the
prototype of which has not been found in the words and acts of our
blessed Lord as related by Matthew.
