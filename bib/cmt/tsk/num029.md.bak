Overview

[Num 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#001.md), The offering at the feast
of trumpets; [Num 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#007.md), at the day of
afflicting their souls; [Num 29:12](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#012.md),
and on the eight days of the feast of tabernacles.

the seventh: That is, the month Tisri, the seventh month of their
ecclesiastical year, but the first of their civil year, answering to our
September. This, which was their new year's day, was a time of great
festivity, and ushered in by the blowing of trumpets; whence it was also
called the feast of blowing the trumpets. In imitation of this Jewish
festival, different nations began the new year with sacrifices and
festivity. The ancient Egyptians did so; and the Persians also
celebrated their nawee rooz, or new year's day, which they held on the
vernal equinox, and which "lasted ten days, during which all ranks
seemed to participate in one general joy. The rich sent presents to the
poor; all were dressed in their holiday clothes; all kept open house;
and religious processions, music, dancing, a species of theatrical
exhibition, rustic sports, and other pastimes, presented a continued
round of varied amusement. Even the dead, and the ideal beings were not
forgotten; rich viands being placed on the tops of houses and high
towers, on the flavour of which the Peris, and spirits of their departed
heroes and friends, were supposed to feast." After the Mohammedan
conquest of Persia, the celebration of this period sensibly declined,
and at last totally ceased, till the time of Jelaladdin (about ad 1082),
who, coming to the crown at the vernal equinox, re-established the
ancient festival, which has ever since been celebrated with pomp and
acclamations. [Lev 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#024.md), [Lev

the first day of the month: The monthly sacrifices were regulated by the
new moons; and it is probable that the solemn sacrifices were appointed
by God, to prevent the idolatry which was usual among the heathen at
this period; who expressed the most extravagant rejoicings on the first
appearance of the new moon. Moses, however, used the return of the moon
only as one of the most natural and convenient measures of time; and
appointed sacrifices to Jehovah, to prevent the Israelites from falling
into the idolatries of their heathen neighbours. In the serene climate
of Arabia and Judea, its first faint crescent is, for the most part,
visible to all.

the fifteenth day: This was the feast of Tabernacles, kept in
commemoration of their dwelling in tents in the wilderness for forty
years. The first and last days were to be kept as sabbaths, on which
there were solemn assemblies; and for seven days sacrifices were
offered. On the other festivals, two bullocks sufficed ([Num
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#011.md), [Num
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#019.md), [Num
28:27](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#027).md), and on the festival at the
beginning of this month, only one was appointed; but, on the first day
of this festival, thirteen young bullocks were appointed; and so on each
successive day, with the decrease of only one bullock, till on the
seventh day, there were only seven, making in all seventy bullocks. The
lambs, and the rams also, were in a double proportion to the number
sacrificed at any other festival. This was an expensive service; but
more easy at this time of the year than any other, as Bishop Patrick
observes, because now their barns were full, and their wine-presses
overflowed; and their hearts might well be supposed to be more enlarged
than at other times, in thankfulness to God for the multitude of his
mercies. The Jewish doctors give this reason for the daily diminution of
the number of the bullocks. the whole number, say they, was according to
the languages of the seventy nations of the world; and the diminution of
one every day signified, that there should be a gradual diminution of
those nations till all things were brought under the government of the
Messiah; in whose days "no sacrifices shall remain, but those of
thanksgiving, prayer, and praise." [Exo

3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#004.md); [Heb
10:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#012.md); At this feast thirteen
bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs, were to be offered. It is worthy
of remark, that in each of the seven days of this feast one bullock is
to be abated, so that on the seventh day ([Num
29:32](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#032).md) they were to offer seven
bullocks, but the rams and lambs were every day alike; which appointment
might signify a diminishing and wearing away of the legal offerings, to
lead them to the spiritual and reasonable service, by presenting their
own bodies a living sacrifice, holy, and acceptable unto God. [Rom

eighth day: Though this day was properly a distinct festival, and
esteemed the chief or high day of the feast, yet fewer sacrifices are
appointed for it than for any of the foregoing seven. On every one of
them two rams and fourteen lambs were offered; but on this day there
were but half as many; and whereas seven bullocks were the fewest that
were offered on any of those days, on this there was only one. At this
feast, there was an extraordinary ceremony of which the rabbins inform
us, namely, the drawing water out of the pool of Siloam, and pouring it,
mixed with wine, on the sacrifice as it lay on the altar. This they are
said to have done with such expressions of joy, that it became a common
proverb, "He that never saw the rejoicing of drawing of water, never saw
rejoicing in all his life." The Jews pretend to ground this custom on
the following passage of Isaiah ([Isa
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#003).md), "With joy shall ye draw water
out of the wells of salvation;" and to this ceremony Jesus is supposed
to refer, when "in the last day, the great day of the feast, he stood
and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink:
he that believeth on me, as the Scripture saith, out of his belly shall
flow rivers of living water" ([Joh
7:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037.md), [Joh
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#038).md), thereby calling off the people
from their carnal mirth and festive and pompous ceremonies, to seek
spiritual refreshment for their minds. [Lev

do: or, offer

in your set feasts: It appears from the account in these two chapters,
that there were annually offered to God, at the public charge,
independently of a prodigious number of voluntary, vow, and trespass
offerings, 15 goats, 21 kids, 72 rams, 132 bullocks, and 1,101 lambs.
But how little is all this compared with the lambs slain every year at
the passover. Cestius, the Roman general, asked the priests how many
persons had come to Jerusalem at their annual festivals. the priests,
numbering the people by the lambs that had been slain, said,
"twenty-five myriads, 5,000, and 600." [Lev
