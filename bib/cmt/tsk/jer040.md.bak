The word: This, and the four following chapters, record the events which
occurred in Judea from the taking of Jerusalem to the retreat of the
remnant of the people to Egypt; and contain several prophecies of
Jeremiah concerning them there; which were "the word which came to
Jeremiah from the Lord." It appears that Jeremiah, after being freed
from prison, continued among the Jews, till he was bound, with others of
them, and carried to Ramah; where he was set a liberty in the manner
related.

Then: It has been doubted whether Jeremiah acted prudently in this
decision, as the event seems to indicate the contrary, and as it was the
evident meaning of all his predictions that the Jews should not prosper
in their own country till the expiration of seventy years. But he was
evidently influenced by the most unbounded love to his country, for
whose welfare he had watched, prayed, and lived; and he now chose rather
to share her adversities, her sorrows, her wants, her afflictions, and
her disgrace, than to be the companion of princes, and to sit at the
table of kings. His patriotism was as unbounded as it was sincere. he
only ceased to live for country when he ceased to breathe. [Jer

Johanan: Johanan and his companions seem to have acted honestly in this
affair. They had received intelligence of designs formed against
Gedaliah's life, and consequently against the whole new settlement.
Ishmael, being a branch of David's family, was probably displeased that
another was preferred above him; and the king of the Ammonites, out of
hatred to the Jews, employed him to slay Gedaliah. But Gedaliah,
conscious of his own integrity and benevolence, took the portrait of
others from his own mind; and therefore believed evil of no man, because
he felt none towards any in his own breast. He may be reproached for
being too credulous and confiding; but this only serves to shew the
greatness of his soul; for a little mind is always suspicious, and ready
to believe the worst of every person and thing. [Jer
