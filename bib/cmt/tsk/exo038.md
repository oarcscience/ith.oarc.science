<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 38:1</span></span>

the altar: This altar consisted of four boards of shittim (acacia) wood,
covered with brass, and hollow in the middle; but it is supposed to have
been filled up with earth when used, for it is expressly said ([Exo
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#024).md) that the altar is to be of
earth. As it was five cubits long and five cubits broad, and three
cubits high, if the cubit be reckoned at 21 inches, it must have been
eight feet nine inches square, and about five feet three inches in
height. [Exo 27:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#001.md), [Exo

1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005.md), looking glasses, or, brazen
glasses, The word maroth, from raah, to see, denotes reflectors, or
mirrors, of any kind. That these could not have been looking glasses, as
in our translation, is sufficiently evident, not only from the glass not
being then in use, but also from the impossibility of making the brazen
laver of such materials. The first mirrors known among men, were the
clear fountain and unruffled lake. The first artificial ones were made
of polished brass, afterwards of steel, and when luxury increased, of
silver; but at a very early period, they were made of a mixed metal,
particularly of tin and copper, the best of which, as Pliny informs us,
were formerly manufactured at Brundusium. When the Egyptians went to
their temples, according to St. Cyril, they always carried their mirrors
with them. The Israelitish women probably did the same; and Dr. Shaw
says, that looking-glasses are still part of the dress of Moorish women,
who carry them constantly hung at their breasts.

assembling: Heb. assembling by troops, It is supposed that these women
kept watch during the night. Among the ancients, women were generally
employed as door-keepers. See note on [Sa1

Bezaleel: [Exo 31:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#001.md), [Exo
35:30-35](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#030.md), [Exo
36:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#001.md); The supernatural
qualifications of Bezaleel and Aholiab proved their divine appointment;
yet they had an express nomination to their work. they were also
miraculously qualified to instruct their assistants, as well as to
superintend them. Christ alone builds the Temple of the Lord, and bears
the glory; but ministers and private Christians, under his direction and
by his grace, may be fellow-workers together with him. They who, in mean
employments, are diligent and humbly contented, are equally acceptable
with those who are engaged in more splendid services. The women who spun
the goats' hair were wise-hearted, as well as the persons who presided
over the work of the tabernacle, or as Aaron, who burnt incense there,
because they did it heartily unto the Lord. Our wisdom and duty consist
in giving God the glory and use of our talents, be they more or less;
neither abusing nor burying them, but occupying with them until our Lord
shall come; being satisfied that it is better to be a door-keeper in his
service, than the most mighty and renowned of the ungodly. - Scott.

All the gold: If we follow the estimation of the learned Dean Prideaux,
the value of the twenty-nine talents, and 730 shekels of gold, will be
198,347. 12s. 6d. The value of the silver contributed by 603,550;
Israelites, at half a shekel, or 1s. 6d. per man, will amount to 45,266.
5s. The value of the 70 talents, 2,400 shekels of brass, will be 513.
17s. The gold weighed 4,245 pounds; the silver, 14,603 pounds; and the
brass, 10,277 pounds, troy weight. The total value of all the gold,
silver, and brass, will consequently amount to 244,127. 14s. 6d.; and
the total weight of these three metals will amount to 29,124 pounds
troy, which reduced to avoirdupois weight, is equal to fourteen tons,
226 pounds! - It may, perhaps, seem difficult to imagine how the
Israelites should be possessed of so much wealth in the desert; but it
should be remembered, that their ancestors were opulent men before they
came into Egypt; that they were further enriched by the spoils of the
Egyptians and Amalekites; and that it is probable, they traded with the
neighbouring nations who bordered on the wilderness. There appear to be
three reasons why so much riches should have been employed in the
construction of the tabernacle, etc.

1\. To impress the people's minds with the glory and dignity of the
Divine Majesty, and the importance of his service.

2\. To take out of their hands the occasion of covetousness.

3\. To prevent pride and vain glory, by leading them to give up to the
divine service even the ornaments of their persons. [Ch1
