with the: [Num 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#001.md), [Num
32:40](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#040.md); [Jos
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#001.md); [Sa2
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#009.md)

unto the: [Jdg 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#018.md), [Jdg
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#026.md), [Jdg
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#011.md)

in Mizpeh: [Jdg 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#017.md), [Jdg
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#011.md); [Jos
15:38](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#038.md), [Jos
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#026.md); [Sa1
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#005.md), [Sa1
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#006.md), [Sa1
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#017.md); [Kg2
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#023.md); It does not appear that the
Israelites on this occasion, were summoned by the authority of any one
common head, but they came together by the consent and agreement, as it
were, of one common heart, fired with a holy zeal for the honour of God
and Israel. The place of their meeting was Mizpeh; they gathered
together unto the Lord there; for Mizpeh was so very near to Shiloh,
that their encampment might very well be supposed to reach from Mizpeh
to Shiloh. Shiloh was a small town, and therefore, when there was a
general meeting of the people to present themselves before God, they
chose Mizpeh for their head quarters, which was the next adjoining city
of note; perhaps, because they were not willing to give that trouble to
Shiloh, which so great an assembly would occasion; it being the
residence of the priests that attended the tabernacle.

was very equitable in this demand; but perhaps the rulers or elders of
Gibeah ought previously to have been applied to, to deliver up the
criminals to justice. However, the refusal of the Benjamites, and their
protection of those who had committed this horrible wickedness, because
they were of their own tribe, prove them to have been deeply corrupted,
and (all their advantages considered) as ripe for divine vengeance as
the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah had been. Confiding in their own
valour and military skill, they seen to have first prepared for battle
in this unequal contest with such superior numbers.

lefthanded: Itter yad yemeeno, "obstructed in his right hand;" so the
Chaldee Targum, gemid beedaih deyammeena, contracted or impeded in his
right hand." Lev. Clerc observes, that the 700 men left-handed seem
therefore to have been made slingers, because they could not use the
right hand, which is employed in managing heavier arms; and they could
discharge the stones from the sling in a direction against which their
opponents were not upon their guard, and thus do the greater execution.
[Jdg 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#015.md); [Ch1
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#002.md)

sling stones: The sling was a very ancient warlike instrument; and, in
the hands of those who were skilled in the use of it, produced
astonishing effects. The inhabitants of the islands of Baleares, now
Majorca and Minorca, were the most celebrated slingers of antiquity.
They did not permit their children to break their fast, till they had
struck down the bread they had to eat from the top of a pole, or some
distant eminence. Vegetius tells us, that slingers could in general hit
the mark at 600 feet distance. [Sa1

And the: It seems most evident that the Israelites did not seek the
protection of God. When they "went to the house of God," ([Jdg
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#018).md), it was not to enquire
concerning the expediency of the war, nor of its success, but which of
the tribes should begin the attack, and here the question is, "Shall I
go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother?"
Having so much right on their side, they had no doubt of the justice of
their cause, and the propriety of their conduct; and having such a
superiority of numbers, they had no doubt of success. But God humbled
them, and delivered them into the hands of their enemies; and shewed
them that the race was not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong.

Let us flee: This was done, not only because they had placed an
ambuscade behind Gibeah, which was to enter and burn the city as soon as
the Benjamites left it; but it would seem, that the slingers, by being
within the city and its fortifications, had great advantage over the
Israelites by their slings, when they could not come among them with
their swords, unless they got them in the plain country. [Jos

was doubtless a strong place; but it is uncertain where situated. It is
probable however, that it was near, and took its name from, the village
of Remmon, mentioned by Eusebius, fifteen miles north from Jerusalem. It
appears that rocks are still resorted to in the East, as places of
security; and some of them are even capable of sustaining a siege. Deut.
Lam. Roque says, that "The Grand Seignior, wishing to seize the person
of the emir (Fakr-eddin, prince of the Druses), gave orders to the pacha
to take him prisoner. he accordingly came in search of him, with a new
army, in the district of Chouf, which is part of mount Lebanon, wherein
is the village of Gesin, and close to it, the rock which served for a
retreat to the emir. It is named in Arabic, Magara Gesin, i.e., the
cavern of Gessin, by which name it is famous. The pacha pressed the emir
so closely, that this unfortunate prince was obliged to shut himself up
in the cleft of a great rock, with a small number of his officers. The
pacha besieged him there several months; and was going to blow up the
rock by a mine, when the emir capitulated.
