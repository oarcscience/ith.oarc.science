[Joel](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#001.md)

It is generally supposed, that the prophet Joel blends two subjects of
affliction in one general consideration, or beautiful allegory; and
that, under the devastation to be produced by locusts in the vegetable
world, he portrays the more distant calamities to be inflicted by the
armies of the Chaldeans in their invasion of Judea. These predictions
are followed by a more general denunciation of God's vengeance,
delivered in such language as to be in some measure descriptive of the
final judgment of mankind. The prophet intermingles these declarations
with earnest exhortations to repentance, and with promises of returning
prosperity productive of Gospel blessings; foretelling, in the clearest
terms, the general effusion of the Holy Spirit under the Christian
dispensation, and the awful consequences of obstinately rejecting the
sacred influence, especially to the Jews. The state of this nation at
the present day, fully attests the Divine inspiration of the prophecy.
