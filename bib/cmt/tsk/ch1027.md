the chief fathers: The patriarchs, chief generals, or generals of
brigade. This enumeration is widely different from that of the
preceding. In that, we have the order and course of the priests and
Levites, in their ecclesiastical ministrations. in this, we have the
account of the order of the civil service, what related simply to the
political state of the king and kingdom. Twenty-four persons, chosen out
of David's worthies, each of whom had a second, were placed over 24,000
men, who all served a month at a time, in turn; and this was the whole
of their service during the year, after which they attended to their own
affairs. Thus the king had always on foot a regular force of 24,000, who
served without expense to him or the state, and were not oppressed by
the service, which took up only a twelfth part of their time; and by
this plan he could, at any time, bring into the field 12 times 24,000 or
288,000 fighting men, independently of the 12,000 officers, which made
in the whole an effective force of 300,000 soldiers; and all these men
were prepared, disciplined, and ready at a call, without the smallest
expense to the state or the king. These were, properly speaking, the
militia of the Israelitish kingdom.

Shamhuth: If this person was the same as Shammoth the Hararite, or
Shammah the Harodite, it is probable that he took the denomination
Izrahite, from one of his progenitors of the name Izrah, and derived the
other from the place of his residence. [Ch1

Furthermore: These persons, called "princes of the tribes," in [Ch1
27:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#022), and [Ch1
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#001), appear to have been civil rulers
over their several tribes, and honorary men, without pay, not unlike the
lords lieutenants of our counties. In this enumeration there is no
mention of the tribes of Gad and Asher, probably because they were
joined to the neighbouring tribes; or perhaps, the account of these has
been lost from the register.

David took not: It seems probable, from this passage, that Joab began,
by David's order, to number the children, as well as adults, but was
prevented from finishing the account, probably because the plague had
begun. The numbering of the effective men might have been deemed a
political expedient; but pride and ostentation alone could dictate the
numbering of minors and infants, especially as God had pronounced the
seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, innumerable.

And over: [Kg1 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#007)

the sycamore trees: The Hebrew shikmin, Syriac shekmo, and Arabic
jummeez, is the συκομορος, or sycomore, of the Greeks, so called from
συκος, a fig-tree, and μορος a mulberry- tree, because it resembles the
latter in its leaves, and the former in its fruits. "The sycamore," says
Mr. Norden, "is of the height of a beech, and bears its fruit in a
manner quite different from other trees. it has them on the trunk
itself, which shoots out little sprigs, in form of grape stalks, at the
end of which grow the fruit close to one another, almost like a cluster
of grapes. The tree is always green, and bears fruit several times in
the year, without observing any certain seasons; for I have seen some
sycamores that have given fruit two months after others. The fruit has
the figure and smell of real figs, but is inferior to them in the taste,
having a disgusting sweetness. Its colour is a yellow, inclining to an
ochre, shadowed by a flesh colour. In the inside it resembles the common
figs, excepting that it has a blackish colouring with yellow spots. This
sort of tree is pretty common in Egypt; the people, for the greater
part, live on its fruit, and think themselves well regaled when they
have a piece of bread, a couple of sycamore figs, and a pitcher of
water." [Kg1 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#027)
