### [Ruth Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#001)

[Ruth](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">rut 3:0</span></span>

Overview

[Rut 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#001), By Naomi's instruction; [Rut
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#005), Ruth lies at Boaz's feet; [Rut
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#008), Boaz acknowledges the right of a
kinsman; [Rut 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#014), He sends her away
with six measures of barley.

shall I not: [Rut 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#009); [Co1

is not Boaz: [Rut 2:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#020); [Deu

2:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#011)

with whose: [Rut 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#008), [Rut
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#023)

he winnoweth: It is probable that the winnowing of grain was effected by
taking up a portion of the corn in a sieve, and letting it down slowly
in the wind; thus the grain would, by its own weight, fall in one place,
while the chaff, etc., would be carried a distance by the wind. It is
said here that this was done at night; probably what was threshed out in
the day was winnowed in the evening, when the sea breeze set in, which
was common in Palestine.

went to lie: Such was the simplicity of those early times, that the most
wealthy persons looked after their own affairs, both at home and in the
field. These threshing-floors were covered at top to keep off the rain,
but lay open on all sides, that the wind might come in freely, for
winnowing the corn; which being done, it is probable they were shut up
at night, with doors fitted to them, that if any one lay there he might
be kept warm, and the corn be secured from robbers.

spread therefore: Hebrew "spread thy wing;" the emblem of protection;
and a metaphor taken from the young of fowls, which run under the wings
of their mother from birds of prey. Even to the present day, when a Jew
marries a woman, he throws the skirts of his talith over her, to signify
that he has taken her under his protection. [Eze

veil: or sheet, or apron, The word mitpachath has been variously
rendered. The LXX translate it περιζωμα, an apron, and Vulgate, pallium,
a cloak. By the circumstances of the story, it must have been of a
considerable size; and accordingly Dr. Shaw thinks it was no other than
the hyke, the finer sort of which, such as are still worn by ladies and
persons of distinction among the Arabs, he takes to answer to the
πεπλος, or robe, of the ancient Greeks.

he measured: [Isa 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#008); [Gal
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#010)

six measures: The quantity of this barley is uncertain. The Targum
renders it, shith sein, "six seahs." A seah contained about two gallons
and a half, six of which must have been a very heavy load for a woman,
and so the Targumist thought, for he adds, "And she received strength
from the Lord to carry it.
