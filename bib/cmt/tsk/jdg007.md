Jerubbaal: It appears that Jerubbaal had now become the surname of
Gideon. He is mentioned by Sanchoniathon, quoted by Eusebius, who lived
in the reign of Ithobal, king of Tyre, and consequently a little after
the time of Gideon, by the name of Jerombalus, a priest of Jeuo or Jao.

mount Gilead: Gideon was certainly not at mount Gilead, east of Jordan
at this time; but rather near mount Gilboa, west of Jordan. Calmet
thinks there must either have been two Gileads, which does not appear
from Scripture to have been the case, or that the Hebrew Text is
corrupt, and that for Gilead we should read Gilboa. This reading, though
adopted by Houbigant, is not confirmed by an manuscript or version. Dr.
Hales endeavours to reconcile the whole, by the supposition that in
Gideon's army there were many eastern Manassites from mount Gilead, near
the Midianites; and therefore proposes to read, "Whosoever from mount
Gilead is fearful and afraid, let him return (home) and depart early."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jdg 7:5</span></span>

lappeth: The original word yalok, is precisely the sound which the dog
makes in lapping. It appears that it is not unusual for the Arabs to
drink water out of the palms of their hands; and, from this account, we
learn that the Israelites did so occasionally. Dr. A. Clarke, in his
edition of Harmer, has presented us with the following curious
manuscript note from Dr. Russell. "When they take water with the palms
of their hands, they naturally place themselves on their hams, to be
nearer the water; but when they drink from a pitcher or gourd, fresh
filled, they do not sit down on purpose to drink, but drink standing,
and very often put the sleeve of their shirt over the mouth of the
vessel, by way of strainer, lest small leeches might have been taken up
with the water. For the same reason they often prefer taking the water
with the palm of the hand to lapping it from the surface." From the
letters of Busbequius we learn, that the Eastern people are not in the
habit of drinking standing. The 300 men, who satisfied their thirst in
the most expeditious manner, by this sufficiently indicated their
spirit, and alacrity to follow Gideon in his dangerous enterprise; while
the rest shewed their love of ease, self-indulgence, effeminacy, and
want of courage. [Jdg 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#005)

three companies: This small number of men, thus divided, would be able
to encompass the whole camp of the Midianites. Concealing the lamps in
the pitchers, they would pass unobserved to their appointed stations;
then, in the dead of the night, when most of the enemy were fast asleep,
all at once breaking their pitchers one against another, with as much
noise as they could, and blowing the trumpets and shouting; they would
occasion an exceedingly great alarm. The obedience of faith alone could
have induced such an expedient, which no doubt God directed Gideon to
employ. - Scott.

Tabbath: Probably the town of Οηβης, mentioned by Eusebius, 13 miles
from Neapolis, or Shechem, towards Scythopolis.

Oreb: Eusebius and Jerome speak of a small place called Araba, three
miles west from Scythopolis, which is supposed by some to have had its
name from Oreb.

and brought: Among ancient nations, the head of the conquered chief was
usually brought to the conqueror. Thus Pompey's head was brought to
Cesar, Cicero's head to Mark Anthony, and the heads of Ahab's children
to Jehu. These barbarities are seldom practised now, except among the
Mahommedans, or the savages of Africa and America; and for the credit of
human nature, it is to be wished that such atrocities had never been
committed.

on the other side: The words maiaiver lyyarden, may denote at the
passage of Jordan, or from beyond Jordan. Gideon does not appear to have
yet passed the Jordan. [Jdg 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#004)
