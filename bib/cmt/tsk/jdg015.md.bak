[Judges 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 15:3</span></span>

caught three: Dr. Kennicott and others contend, that for shualim,
"foxes," we should read shoalim, "handfuls," or sheaves of corn. But:

1\. The word lachad, rendered caught, never signifies simply to get or
take but always to catch, seize, or take by assault or stratagem.

2\. Though the proposed alteration is sanctioned by seven manuscripts,
yet all the versions are on the other side.

3\. Admitting this alteration, it will be difficult to prove that the
word shoal means either a sheaf or a handful of corn in the ear, and
straw. It occurs but thrice in Scriptures ([Kg1
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#010.md). [Isa
40:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#012.md). [Eze
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#009).md): where it evidently means as
much as can be contained in the hollow of the hand; but when handfuls of
grain in the shock, or sheaves are intended, very different words are
used. See note on [Rut 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#015.md), [Rut
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#016.md), etc.

4\. It is not hinted that Samson collected them alone, or in one day; he
might have employed many hands and several days in the work.

5\. The word shual properly denotes the jackal, which travellers
describe as an animal in size between the wolf and fox, gregarious, as
many as 200 having been seen together, and the most numerous of any in
eastern countries; so that Samson might have caught many of them
together in nets. [Psa 63:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#010.md); [Sol

a thousand: Some would render the words aileph ish, "a chief;" but it is
alluph, and not aileph, which signifies a chief; besides which, the
Hebrew idiom would, even in that case, require it to be ish alluph, "a
man, a chief," and not alluph ish, "a chief, a man." Add to which, that
every version renders it "a thousand men.

chamorathayim, "With the jaw-bone of an ass, a heap upon two heaps."

place called Lehi where a spring was supernaturally opened.

40:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#026.md)

Enhakkore: Samson gave this expressive name to the miraculously
springing water, to be as a memorial of the goodness of God to him.
En-hakkore, the well of him that cried, which kept him in remembrance
both of his own distress which caused him to cry, and the favour of
Jehovah to him in answer to his cry. Many a spring of comfort God opens
to his people, which may fitly be called by the name En-hakkore, and
this instance of Samson's relief should encourage us to trust in God,
for when he pleases he can open rivers in high places. [Isa
41:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#017.md), [Isa
41:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#018.md); Samson at first gave the name
of Ramath-lehi (the lifting up of the jaw-bone) which denoted him great
and triumphant, but now he gives it another name, En-hakkore, which
denotes him wanting and dependent. [Gen
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#013.md), [Gen
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#014.md), [Gen
