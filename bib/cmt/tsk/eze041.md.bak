### [Ezekiel Chapter 41](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 41:0</span></span>

Overview

[Eze 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#001.md), The measures, parts,
chambers, and ornaments of the temple.

[Ezekiel 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 41:1</span></span>

he brought: [Eze 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#002.md), [Eze
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#003.md), [Eze
40:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#017.md)

to the temple: [Kg1 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#002.md); [Zac
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#012.md), [Zac
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013.md); [Eph

21:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#003.md), [Rev
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#015.md)

the posts: These were probably a sort of door-case on each side of the
entrance; and the tabernacle perhaps was a kind of covering to the door,
of the same dimensions.

[Ezekiel 41:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 41:2</span></span>

the door: or, the entrance, This was the door out of the porch into the
sanctuary, which seems to have been wider than that from the court to
the porch. [Exo 26:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#036.md), [Exo
36:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#037.md); [Kg1

the length: [Kg1 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#002.md), [Kg1
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#017.md); [Ch2

[Ezekiel 41:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 41:3</span></span>

two cubits: This was the thickness of the partition wall between the
sanctuary ([Eze 41:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#002).md) and holy of
holies ([Eze 41:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#004).md); the breadth of the
wall on each side of the gate being seven cubits, and the entrance into
the holy place six cubits in width. [Eze
41:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#003.md)

[Ezekiel 41:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 41:4</span></span>

twenty cubits: [Kg1 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#020.md); [Ch2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#008.md); [Rev
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#016.md)

This: [Exo 26:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#033.md), [Exo

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 41:5</span></span>

side chamber: [Eze 41:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#006.md), [Eze
41:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#007.md), [Eze
42:3-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#003.md); [Kg1
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#005.md), [Kg1
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#006.md)

[Ezekiel 41:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 41:6</span></span>

one over another: Heb. side chamber over side chamber, thirty in order.
or, three and thirty times, or feet. We find by Josephus, that around
Solomon's temple were chambers three stories high, each story consisting
of thirty chambers; which are supposed to have been on the north, south,
and east sides of the temple.

and they: [Kg1 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#006.md), [Kg1
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#010.md)

have hold: Heb. be holden, [Pe1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#005.md)

but: That is, the beams or supporters, of the chambers were not let into
the main wall of the temple; but rested on projections of the outer
wall, which became a cubit narrower at every story, leaving a ledge of
one cubit, to support the beams.

[Ezekiel 41:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 41:7</span></span>

there was: Heb. it was, made broader, and went round, [Kg1
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#008.md); [Mat
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#032.md); [Heb
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#001.md)

an enlarging: In the same proportion in which the thickness of the wall
decreased, the chambers increased, so that the middle story was one
cubit larger, and the upper story two cubits larger, than the lower
rooms; and a winding staircase, which widened in the same manner as the
rooms, ascended from the bottom to the top.

was five: [Eze 41:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#005.md)

that which: This appears to have been a walk, or gallery of
communication between the chambers, five cubits broad, into which the
doors opened. [Eze 41:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#011.md), [Eze
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#001.md), [Eze

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 41:10</span></span>

the chambers: As the word rendered chambers is different from that used
before, it is supposed there was another row of buildings, parallel with
the side chambers, with a passage of twenty cubits between. [Eze
41:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#010.md)

[Ezekiel 41:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#011.md)

of the temple.

square cubits. [Eze 41:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#013.md)

covered: Probably either by jutting out of the main wall of the temple;
or by lattice work, or curtains, or by both.

[Ezekiel 41:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 41:17</span></span>

To that: That is, the windows were placed above the height of the door,
at the east end of the temple, and thus continued, at the same height,
and at measured distances, along both sides of the holy place, to the
wall of the inner sanctuary, in which there were no windows.

altar: This must signify the altar of incense; which, both in the
tabernacle and Solomon's temple, was covered with plates of gold. It is
very remarkable, that in this temple described by Ezekiel, there is not
the least mention of gold or silver, though there was such a profusion
of these metals in the former; which may probably imply, that a glory of
a more spiritual nature was intended under these emblems. [Exo
