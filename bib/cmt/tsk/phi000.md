The Church at Philippi in Macedonia was planted by the Apostle Paul
about ad 53 (Acts 16:9-40); and it appears he visited them again, ad 60,
though no particulars are recorded concerning that visit ([Act
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#006)). The Philippians were greatly
attached to St. Paul, and testified their affection by sending him
supplies, even when labouring for other churches ([Phi
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#015), [Phi
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#016); [Co2
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#009)); and when they heard that he was
under confinement at Rome, they sent Epaphroditus, one of their pastors,
to him with a present, lest he should want necessaries during his
imprisonment ([Phi 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#025); [Phi
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#010), [Phi
4:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#014)). The more immediate occasion
of the Epistle was the return of Epaphroditus, by whom the apostle sent
it as a grateful acknowledgment of their kindness; which occurred
towards the close of his first imprisonment, about the end of ad 62, or
the commencement of 63.
