Colosse was a large and populous city of Phrygia Pacatiana, in Asia
Minor, seated on an eminence to the south of the river Meander. It is
supposed to have occupied a site now covered with ruins, near the
village of Konous or Khonas, and about twenty miles nw of Degnizlu. By
whom, or at what time, the church at Colosse was founded is wholly
uncertain; but it would appear from the apostle's declaration, [Col
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001), that he was not the honoured
instrument. It appears from the tenor of this epistle to have been, upon
the whole, in a very flourishing state; but some difficulties having
arisen among them, they sent Epaphras to Rome, where the apostle was now
imprisoned ([Col 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#003)) to acquaint him
with the state of their affairs. It is remarkable for a peculiar pathos
and ardour, which is generally ascribed to the extraordinary divine
consolations enjoyed by the apostle during his sufferings for the sake
of Christ. Whoever, says Michaelis, would understand the Epistles to the
Ephesians and Colossians, must read them together. The one is in most
places a commentary on the other; the meaning of single passages in one
epistle, which, if considered alone, might be variously interpreted,
being determined by the parallel passages in the other epistle.
