### [Luke Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md)

[Luke](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">luk 0:0</span></span>

Luke, to whom this Gospel has been uniformly attributed from the
earliest ages of the Christian church, is generally allowed to have been
"the beloved physician" mentioned by Paul ([Col
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#014).md); and as he was the companion of
that apostle, in all his labours and sufferings, for many years ([Act
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#012.md); [Act
20:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001.md); [Act
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#001.md), [Act
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#002.md); [Act
28:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#013.md). [Ti2
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#011.md). [Plm
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#024).md), and wrote "the Acts of the
Apostles," which conclude with a brief account of Paul's imprisonment at
Rome, we may be assured that he had the Apostle's sanction to what he
did; and probably this Gospel was written some time before that event,
about ad 63 or 64, as is generally supposed. He would appear, from [Col
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010.md), [Col
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#011.md), and his intimate acquaintance
with the Greek language, as well as from his Greek name Λουκας
\[Strong's G3065\], to have been of Gentile extraction; and according to
Eusebius and others, he was a native of Antioch. But, from the Hebraisms
occurring in his writings, and especially from his accurate knowledge of
the Jewish rites, ceremonies, and custom, it is highly probable that he
was a Jewish proselyte, and afterwards converted to Christianity. Though
he may not have been, as some have affirmed, one of the seventy
disciples, and an eye-witness of our Saviour's miracles, yet his
intercourse with the apostles, and those who were eye-witnesses of the
works and ear witnesses of the words of Christ, renders him an
unexceptional witness, if considered merely as an historian; and the
early and unanimous reception of his Gospel as divinely inspired is
sufficient to satisfy every reasonable person.
