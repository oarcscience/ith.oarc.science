[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md)

Leviticus is a most interesting and important book; a book containing a
code of sacrificial, ceremonial, civil, and judicial laws, which, for
the purity of their morality, the wisdom, justice, and beneficence of
their enactments, and the simplicity, dignity, and impressive nature of
their rites, are perfectly unrivalled, and altogether worthy of their
Divine Author. All the rites and ceremonies of the Mosaic law are at
once dignified and expressive. They point out the holiness of their
Author, the sinfulness of man, the necessity of an atonement, and the
state of moral excellence to which the grace and mercy of the Creator
have destined to raise the human soul. They include, as well as point
out, the gospel of the Son of God; from which they receive their
consummation and perfection. The sacrifices and oblations were
significant of the atonement of Christ; the requisite qualities of these
sacrifices were emblematical of his immaculate character; and the
prescribed mode in the form of these offerings, and the mystical rites
ordained, were allusive institutions, calculated to enlighten the
apprehensions of the Jews, and to prepare them for the reception of the
Gospel. The institution of the high priesthood typified Jesus, the Great
High Priest, called and prepared of God, who hath an unchangeable
priesthood, and is able to save to the uttermost all that come unto God
by him.
