St. Jude, says Origen, has written an Epistle in a few lines indeed, but
full of vigorous expressions of heavenly grace - Ιουδας \[Strong's
G2455\], μεν \[Strong's G3303\], εγραψεν επιστολην ολιγοστιχον μεν
\[Strong's G3303\], πεπληρωμενην δε \[Strong's G1161\], ουρανιου χαριτος
ερρωμενων λογων.

He briefly and forcibly represents the detestable doctrines and
practices of certain false teachers, generally supposed to be the impure
Gnostics, Nicolaitans and followers of Simon Magus; and reproves these
profligate perverters of sound principles, and patrons of lewdness, with
a holy indignation and just severity; while at the same time he exhorts
all sound Christians, with genuine apostolic charity, to have tender
compassion on these deluded wretches, and to endeavour vigorously to
reclaim them from the ways of hell, and pluck them as brands out of the
fire. There is a great similarity in sentiment and style between this
Epistle and the second chapter of the second Epistle of Peter. Both
writers are nearly alike in vehemence and holy indignation against
impudence and lewdness, and against those who insidiously undermine
chastity, purity, and sound principles.
