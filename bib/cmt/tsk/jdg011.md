Overview

[Jdg 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#001.md), The covenant between
Jephthah and the Gileadites, that he should be their head; [Jdg
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#012.md), The treaty of peace between him
and the Ammonites is in vain; [Jdg
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#029.md), Jephthah's vow; [Jdg
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#032.md), His conquest of the Ammonites;
[Jdg 11:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#034.md), He performs his vow on his

an harlot: Heb. a woman

an harlot: Probably zonah should be rendered as in [Jos
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#001.md), a hostess, or inn-keeper, so
Targum of Jonathan, wehoo bar ittetha pundekeetha, "and he was the son
of a woman, a tavern-keeper." She was very probably a Canaanite, as she
is called, [Jdg 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#002.md), a strange woman,
ishah achereth, "a woman of another race;" and on this account his
brethren drove him from the family, as not having a full right to the
inheritance.

from his brethren: Heb. from the face of

Tob: Probably the same as Ish-Tob; and appears to have been a part of
Syria, near Zobah, Rehob, and Maachah, east of Jordan, and in the most
northern part of the portion of Manasseh. If so, it could not be far
from Gilead, the country of Jephthah. This country is called Tobie or
Tubin, 1; Mac [Heb 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#013.md); and the Jews
who inhabited this district Tubieni, 2; Mac [Heb

Jephthah uttered: That is, upon his elevation, he immediately retired to
his devotion, and in prayer spread the whole matter before God, both his
choice to the office, and his execution of the office, as one that had
his eye ever toward the Lord, and would do nothing without him; that
leaned not to his own understanding or courage, but depended on the
Almighty God, and his favour. This is an ensample worthy of universal
imitation; in All Our Ways, whether great or apparently subordinate, let
us acknowledge God and seek his direction. So shall we make our way
prosperous, and obtain that peace which passeth all understanding.
Jephthah opened his campaign with prayer.

Mizpeh: This Mizpeh was east of Jordan in the mountains of Gilead ([Gen
31:49](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#049).md); and hence called Mizpeh of
Gilead ([Jdg 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#029).md), to distinguish it
from another place of the same name, west of Jordan, in the tribe of
Judah. [Jos 15:38](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#038.md)

sent messengers: In this Jephthah acted in accordance with the law of
Moses; and hence the justice of his cause would appear more forcibly to
the people. [Num 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#014.md), [Num

But when: The whole of these messages shew, Jephthah had well studied
the book of Moses. His arguments also are very clear and cogent, and his
demands reasonable; for he only required that the Ammonites should cease
to harass a people who had neither injured them, nor intended to do so.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jdg 11:23</span></span>

Jephthah shews that the Israelites did not take the land of the Moabites
or Ammonites, but that of the Amorites, which they had conquered from
Sihon their king; and although the Amorites had taken the lands in
question from the Ammonites, yet the title by which Israel held them was
good, because they took them, not from the Ammonites, but from the
Amorites.

[Judges 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jdg 11:24</span></span>

Wilt not thou possess: This is simply an argumentum ad hominem; in which
Jephthah argues on this principles recognized by the king of Ammon. As
if he had said, "You suppose that the land which you possess was given
you by your god Chemosh; and therefore will not relinquish what you
believe you hold by a divine right. Now we know that Jehovah, our God,
has given us the land of the Israelites; and therefore we will not give
it up."

referred to the person to whom the sacrifice was to be made, than to the
thing to be sacrificed. Unless understood in this way, or as the
marginal reading, it must have been the vow of a heathen or a madman. If
a dog, or other uncleaned animal had met him, he could not have made it
a burnt offering; or if his neighbour's wife, sons, etc., his vow gave
him no right over them. [Lev 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#011.md),

did with: That Jephthah did not sacrifice his daughter, but consecrated
her to the service of God in the tabernacle, in a state of celibacy,
will we imagine be evident from the following consideration -

1\. Human sacrifices were ever an abomination to Jehovah, of which
Jephthah could not be ignorant; and consequently he would neither have
made such a vow, nor carried it into execution.

2\. We are expressly told ([Jdg 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#029).md)
that Jephthah was under the influence of the Spirit of God, which would
effectually prevent him from embruing his hands in the blood of his own
child.

3\. He had it in his power to redeem his daughter ([Lev
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#004).md); and surely his only child must
have been of more value than thirty shekles.

4\. Besides, who was to perform the horrid rite? Not Jephthah himself,
who was no priest, and in whom it would have been most unnatural and
inhuman; and the priests would certainly have dissuaded him from it.

5\. The sacred historian informs us, that she bewailed her virginity,
that she knew no man, and that the Israelitish women went yearly to
comfort or lament with her. [Jdg
