Overview

[Est 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#001), Ahasuerus, reading in the
chronicles of the good service done by Mordecai, takes care for his
reward; [Est 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#004), Haman, coming to sue
that Mordecai might be hanged, gives counsel that he might do him
honour; [Est 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#012), Complaining of
this, his friends tell him of his final destiny.

the horse: Herodotus relates, that the kings of Persia had horses
peculiar to themselves, which were brought from Armenia, and were
remarkable for their beauty; and if the same law prevailed in Persia as

person who turns a Mohammedan, at Algiers: "The apostate is to get on a
stately steed, with a rich saddle and fine trappings. he is also richly
habited, and has a turban on his head, but nothing of this is to be
called his own; only there are given him about two or three yards of
broad cloth, which is laid before him on the saddle. The horse, with him
on his back, is led all round the city, which he is several hours in
doing. The apostate is attended with drums and other music, and twenty
or thirty serjeants. They march in order on each side of the horse, with
naked swords in their hands. The crier goes before, with a loud voice
giving thanks to God for the proselyte that is made.
