The book of Judges forms an important link in the history of the
Israelites. It furnishes us with a lively description of a fluctuating
and unsettled nation; a striking picture of the disorders and dangers
which prevailed in a republic without magistracy; when "the high-ways
were unoccupied, and the travellers walked through by-ways" ([Jdg
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#006)), when few prophets were appointed
to control the people, and "every one did that which was right in his
own eyes" ([Jdg 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#006)). It exhibits the
contest of true religion with superstition; and displays the beneficial
effects that flow from the former, and the miseries and evil
consequences of impiety. It is a most remarkable history of the
long-suffering of God towards the Israelites, in which we see the most
signal instances of his justice and mercy alternately displayed. the
people sinned, and were punished; they repented, and found mercy. These
things are written for our warning. none should presume, for God is
just; none need despair, for God is merciful. Independently of the
internal evidence of the authenticity of this sacred book, the
transactions it records are not only cited or alluded to by other
inspired writers, but are further confirmed by the traditions current
among heathen nations.
