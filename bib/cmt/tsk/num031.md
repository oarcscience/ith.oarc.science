Arm some: [Exo 17:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#009)

avenge the Lord: It was God's quarrel, not their own, that they were now
to take up. These people were idolaters, and had seduced the Israelites
to practise the same abominations. Idolatry is an offence against God;
and the civil power has no authority to meddle with what belongs to Him,
without especial directions, certified, as in this case, in the most
unequivocal manner. Private revenge, ambition, or avarice were to have
no place in this business: Jehovah is to be avenged; and through Him,
the children of Israel ([Num 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#002)),
because they were nearly ruined by their idolatries. If Jehovah, instead
of punishing sinners by earthquakes, pestilence, or famine,is pleased
expressly to command any person or people to avenge his cause, this
commission justifies, nay sanctifies, war, massacre, or devastation.
Though none at present shew such a commission, yet the Israelites could;
and it is therefore absurd to censure Moses, Joshua, and Israel, for the
dreadful slaughter made by them. God himself passed sentence of
condemnation, and employed them merely as ministers of his vengeance;
and unless it could be proved that the criminals did not deserve their
doom, or that God had no right to punish his rebellious creatures, such
objectors only shew their enmity to God by becoming the unsolicited
advocates of his enemies. [Num 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#011),

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 31:6</span></span>

a thousand: Twelve thousand in all - a small number in proportion to all
Israel, or to the forces which they had to encounter. As they were under
the conduct of captains of thousands and hundreds, they probably had no
general; for Phinehas seems to have accompanied them simply to take
charge of "the holy instruments;" probably the ark and silver trumpets.

kill every male: The sword of war should spare women and children, as
incapable of resisting; but the sword of justice knows no distinction,
except that of guilty or not guilty, or more or less guilty. This was
the execution of a righteous sentence upon a guilty nation, in which the
women were the greatest criminals; and it may safely be said, that their
lives were forfeited by their personal transgressions. With respect to
the execution of the male infants, who cannot be supposed to have been
guilty, God, the author and supporter of life, who has a right to
dispose of it when and how he thinks proper, commanded it; and "shall
not the Judge of all the earth do right?" [Jdg

keep alive for yourselves: It has been groundlessly asserted, that Moses
here authorised the Israelites to make concubines of the whole number of
female children; and an insidious objection against his writings has
been grounded upon this monstrous supposition. But the whole tenor of
the law, and especially a statute recorded in [Deu
21:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#010), proves most decisively to
the contrary. They were merely permitted to possess them as female
slaves, educating them in their families, and employing them as
domestics; for the laws concerning fornication, concubinage, and
marriage, were in full force, and prohibited an Israelite even from
marrying a captive, without delays and previous formalities; and if he
afterwards divorced her, he was to set here at liberty, "because he had
humbled her." [Lev 25:44](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#044); [Deu
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#014), [Deu
21:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#010); [Ch2

the booty: It appears from the enumeration here, that the Israelites, in
this war with the Midianites, took 32,000 female prisoners, 61,000
asses, 72,000 beeves, and 675,000 sheep and small cattle; besides the
immense number of males who fell in battle, and the women and children
who were slain by the divine command ([Num
31:17](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#017)). This booty was divided into
equal parts, by which partition a far larger share was justly given to
the warriors employed on the expedition, who were only 12,000, than to
those, who being equally willing to go, were ordered to stay in the
camp. Each party was to give a certain proportion to Jehovah, as their
sovereign, in grateful acknowledgment that to him they owed their
success. The soldiers to give to the Lord one out of every five hundred
persons, beeves, asses, and sheep ([Num
31:28](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#028)), and the people, who by staying
at home risked nothing, and had no fatigue, were to give one out of
fifty of each of the above to the Levites, who were far more numerous
than the priests ([Num 31:30](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#030)). The
booty, its division among the soldiers and people, and the proportion
given by each to the Lord and to the Levites, will be seen at one view
by the following table:

or ass, was required by Moses as his portion; or that there was any
given to him by the people; and though he had a family as well as
others, yet no provision was made for them above the common lot of
Levites!

with gratitude for this most remarkable interposition of Providence in
their favour, they now offer to Jehovah the golden jewels which they had
