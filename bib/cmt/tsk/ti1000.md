### [1 Timothy Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001.md)

[1 Timothy](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ti1 0:0</span></span>

This Epistle bears the impress of its genuineness and authenticity,
which are corroborated by the most decisive external evidence; and its
Divine inspiration is attested by the exact accomplishment of the
prediction which it contains respecting the apostasy in the latter days.
This prophecy is similar in the general subject to that in the second
Epistle to the Thessalonians, though it differs in the particular
circumstances; and exactly corresponds with that of the prophet Daniel
on the same subject ([Dan 11:38](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#038).md). This
important prediction might be more correctly rendered, "Now the Spirit
speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall apostatize from
the faith, giving heed to erroneous spirits, and doctrines concerning
demons, through the hypocrisy of liars, having their consciences seared
with a hot iron, forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from
meats," etc. How applicable these particulars are to the corruptions of
the Church of Rome need scarcely be insisted on. The worship of saints
in that church is essentially the same with the worship of demons among
the heathen; which has been established in the world by books forged in
the name of the Apostles and saints, by lying legends of their lives, by
false miracles ascribed to their relics, and by fabulous dreams and
relations; while celibacy was enjoined and practised under pretence of
chastity, and abstinence under pretence of devotion. None but the SPIRIT
OF GOD could foresee and foretell these remarkable events.
