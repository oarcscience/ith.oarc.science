<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 21:8</span></span>

Jabeshgilead: This place, as its name imports, was situated in Gilead,
east of Jordan. Eusebius and Jerome say it was a great town in their
time, standing upon a hill, six miles south from Pella, in the way to
Geresa, now Djerash. The Wady Yabes, mentioned by Burckhardt, which
empties itself into the Jordan, in the neighbourhood of Bisan or
Beth-shan (see note on [Sa1 31:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#011).md),
and upon which Pella was situated (celebrated by Pliny, 1. v. c. 18, for
its fine waters), seems to have taken its name from Jabesh. Near this
spot, we must therefore look for its site; and the place called Kalaat
Rabbad seems to correspond, very nearly, to the spot; though it probably
still retains among the Arabs its ancient name. [Sa1
11:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#001.md), [Sa1
31:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#011.md); [Sa2

Go and smite: As they had sworn to destroy those who would not assist in
the war ([Jdg 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#005).md), they determined
to destroy the men of Jabesh, and to leave none except the virgins; and
to give these to the 600; Benjamites who had escaped to the rock of
Rimmon. The whole account is dreadful. The crime of the men of Gibeah
was of the deepest dye; the punishment involving both the guilty and
innocent, was extended to the most criminal excess, and their mode of
remedying the evil they had occasioned was equally abominable. [Jdg
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#005.md), [Jdg
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#023.md); [Deu

of the highway: or, on

Lebonah: Maundrell supposes, that either Khan Leban, which is situated
on the eastern side of a "delicious vale," four leagues south from
Shechem, and two leagues north from Bethel, or the village of Leban,
which is on the opposite side, occupies the site of the ancient Lebonah.
It is eight hours, or about 24 miles, from Jerusalem, according to Dr.
Richardson.

and they went: It appears that the Benjamites acted in the most
honourable way to the women they had thus violently carried off, and we
may rest assured, that they took them to an inheritance more than equal
to their own. But this transaction, as well as the indiscriminate
massacre of the people of Jabesh-gilead, as Dr. Gray observes, was
certainly stamped with injustice and cruelty; and must be condemned on
those principles which the Scriptures elsewhere furnish.
