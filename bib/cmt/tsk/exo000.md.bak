[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 0:0</span></span>

The title of this Book is derived from the Septuagint; in which it is
called ΕΞΟΔΟΣ, "Exodus;" or, as it is in the Codex Alexandrinus, ΕΞΟΔΟΣ
Αιγυπτου, "the Exodus or departure from Egypt;" but it is called in
Hebrew Bibles ואלה שׁמות, Weelleh Shemoth, "these are the names," or
merely, שׁמות , Shemoth, "names," from the words with which it
commences.

Moses was undoubtedly the author of this Book, which forms a
continuation of the preceding, and was evidently written after the
promulgation of the law. it embraces the history of about 145 years.
Moses, having in the Book of Genesis described the creation of the
world, the origin of nations, and the peopling of the earth, details in
the Book of Exodus the commencement and nature of the Jewish Church and
Polity, which has very properly been termed a Theocracy (Θεοκρατια, from
Θεος \[Strong's G2316\], God, and κρατεω \[Strong's G2902\], to rule),
in which Jehovah appears not merely as their Creator and God, but as
their King. Hence this and the following books of Moses are not purely
historical; but contain not only laws for the regulation of their moral
conduct and the rites and ceremonies of their religious worship, but
judicial and political laws relating to government and civil life. The
stupendous facts connected with these events, may be clearly perceived
by consulting the marginal references; and many of the circumstances are
confirmed by the testimony of heathen writers. Numenius, a Pythagorean
philosopher, mentioned by Eusebius, speaks of the opposition of the
magicians, whom he calls Jannes and Jambres, to the miracles of Moses.
Though the names of these magicians are not preserved in the Sacred
Text, yet tradition had preserved them in the Jewish records, from which
St. Paul ([Ti2 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#008).md) undoubtedly
quotes. Add to this that many of the notions of the heathen respecting
the appearance of the Deity, and their religious institutions and laws,
were borrowed from this book; and many of their fables were nothing more
than distorted traditions of those events which are here plainly related
by Moses.
