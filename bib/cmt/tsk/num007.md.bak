[Numbers 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 7:3</span></span>

covered wagons: The Hebrew egloth tzav, signifies "tilted wagons;" so
LXX αμαξας λαμπηνικας, with which the Coptic agrees. These were given
for the more convenient exporting of the heavier parts of the
tabernacle. [Num 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#003.md)

[Numbers 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 7:5</span></span>

Take it: [Exo 25:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#001.md), [Exo

4:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011.md); [Tit
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#008.md)

give them: i.e. distribute them among the Levites as they need them;
giving most to those who have the heaviest burdens to bear.

[Numbers 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 7:7</span></span>

Two wagons: [Num 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#025.md), [Num
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#026.md), [Num
4:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#024.md)

sons of Gershon: The Gershonites being fewest in number of able men, had
the less burdensome things to carry; for they carried only the curtains,
coverings, and hangings ([Num 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#025.md),
[Num 4:40](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#040).md). And although this was a
cumbersome carriage, and they needed waggons, yet it was not a heavy
one, and they needed few.

[Numbers 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 7:8</span></span>

four wagons: [Num 3:36](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#036.md), [Num
3:37](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#037.md), [Num
4:28-33](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#028.md)

the sons: Though the Merarites were the most numerous, yet they had the
greatest burden, namely, the boards, bars, pillars, and sockets, to
carry ([Num 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#031.md), [Num
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#032.md), [Num
4:48](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#048).md). Therefore they had double the
number of waggons to what the Gershonites had assigned them.

[Numbers 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 7:9</span></span>

unto the: Because they had the charge of the ark, table, candlestick,
altars, etc. ([Num 4:4-15](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#004).md), which were
to be carried upon their shoulders. for those sacred things must not be
drawn by beasts.

peace: Lev. 3:1-17; [Co2 5:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019.md)

this was the offering: It is worthy of remark, that the different tribes
are represented here as bringing their offerings precisely in the same
order in which they encamped about the tabernacle (see [Num
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#001.md) and [Num
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#001).md), beginning at the East, then
proceeding to the South, then to the West, and ending with the North,
according to the course of the sun. Their order may be thus viewed:

Encampment / Offerings EAST 1. Judah Nahshon 2. Issachar Nathaneel 3.
Zebulun Eliab SOUTH 4. Reuben Elizur 5. Simeon Shelumiel 6. Gad Eliasaph
WEST 7. Ephraim Elishama 8. Manasseh Gamaliel 9. Benjamin Abidan NORTH
10. Dan Ahiezer 11. Asher Pagiel 12. Naphtali Ahira Thus God evinces
that he "is not the author of confusion, but of peace" ([Co1
14:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#033).md). It is also worthy of remark,
that every tribe offers the same kind of offering, and in the same
quantity, to shew, that as every tribe was equally indebted to God for
its support, so each should testify an equal sense of obligation.
Besides, the vessels were all sacrificial vessels, and the animals were
all clean animals, such as were proper for sacrifices; and therefore
everything was intended to point out, that the people were to be a holy
people, fully dedicated to God, and that God was to dwell among them.
Thus, as the priests, altar, etc. were anointed, and the tabernacle
dedicated, so the people, by this offering, became consecrated to God.
Therefore every act here was a religious act.

offering: Num. 7:13-89

charger: Kaârah, in Arabic, kâran, from kuâra, to be deep, a large deep
dish or bowl. It appears by the metal of which this charger and bowl
were made, that they were for the use of the altar of burnt offerings in
the outer court; for all the vessels of the sanctuary were of gold. It
was probably used for receiving the flesh of the sacrifices upon which
the priests feasted, or the fine flour for the meat offerings.

Bowl: Mizrak, from zarak, to sprinkle, a bowl or bason, used in
sprinkling the blood of the sacrifice ([Exo
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#021).md).

was put. Both the metal of which it was made, and that which it
contained, shew that it was for the use of the golden altar in the
sanctuary.

incense: [Psa 66:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#015.md); [Mal

And for a sacrifice: These sacrifices were more numerous than the burnt
offering or the sin offering; because the priests, the princes, and as
many of the people as they invited, had a share of them, and feasted,
with great rejoicing, before the Lord. This custom, as Mr. Shelden
observes, seems to have been imitated by the heathen, who dedicated
their altars, temples, statues, etc., with much ceremony.

On the seventh: Both Jewish and Christian writers have been surprised
that this work of offering went forward on the seventh day (which they
suppose to have been a sabbath), as well as on the other days. But:

1\. There is no absolute proof that this seventh day of offering was a
sabbath.

2\. Were it even so, could the people be better employed than in thus
consecrating themselves and their services to the Lord?

We have already seen that every act was a religious act; and we may rest
assured, that no day was too holy for the performance of such acts as
are here recorded. Here it may be observed, that Moses has thought fit
to set down distinctly, and at full length, the offerings of the princes
of each tribe, though, as we have already observed, they were the very
same, both in quantity and quality, that an honourable mention might be
made of every one apart, and that none might think himself in the least
neglected.

Whether there were any prayers made for the gracious acceptance of the
sacrifices which should be hereafter offered on the altar, we are not
informed; but the sacrifices themselves were of the nature of
supplications, and it is probable, that they who offered them, made
humble petitions along with them.

On the tenth day: When the twelve days of the dedication commenced
cannot be easily determined; but the computation of F. Scacchus seems
highly probable. He supposes, that the tabernacle being erected the
first day of the first month of the second year after the departure from
Egypt, seven days were spent in the consecration of it, and the altar,
etc.; and that on the eight day, Moses began to consecrate Aaron and his
sons, which lasted seven days more. Then, on the fourteenth day of that
month, was the feast day of unleavened bread; which God commanded to be
observed in the first month ([Num
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#001).md), and which lasted till the 22nd.
The rest of the month, we may well suppose, was spent in giving,
receiving, and delivering the laws contained in the book of Leviticus;
after which, on the first day of the second month, Moses began to number
the people, according to the command in the beginning of this book;
which may be supposed to have lasted three days. On the fourth, the
Levites were numbered; on the next day we may suppose they were offered
to God, and given to the Priests; and on the sixth, they were expiated
and consecrated, as we read in the following chapter. On the seventh
day, their several charges were assigned them ([Num
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#001).md); after which, he supposes the
princes began to offer, on the eight day of the second month, for the
dedication of the altar, which lasted till the nineteenth day
inclusively; and on the twentieth day of this month, they removed from
Sinai to the wilderness of Paran ([Num
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#011.md), [Num
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#012).md).

eleventh day: Dr. Adam Clarke remarks, that the Hebrew form of
expression here, and in [Num 7:78](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#078.md), has
something curious in it; beyom âshtey âsar yom, "in the day, the first
and tenth day;" beyom shenim âsar yom, "in the day, two and tenth day."
But this is the idiom of the language; and to an original Hebrew, our
almost anomalous words eleventh and twelfth, would appear as strange.

Num. 7:13-89; The oblations and sacrifices enumerated in vv.13-88 were
simple and plain, though costly and magnificent. On this occasion we
find there were offered 12 silver chargers, each weighing 130 shekels;
12 silver bowls, each 70 shekels; [Num
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#012.md) golden spoons, each 10 shekels;
making the total amount of silver vessels 2,400 shekels, and that of
golden vessels, 120 shekels. A silver charger, at 130 shekels, reduced
to troy weight, makes 75 oz. 9 dwts. 16, 8/31 gr.; and a silver bowl, at
70 shekels, amounts to 40 oz. 12 dwts. 21, 21/31 gr. The total weight of
the 12 chargers is therefore 905 oz. 16 dwts. [Num
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#003.md), [Num
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#003.md)/31 gr.; and that of the 12 bowls,
487 oz. 14 dwts. 20; [Num 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#004.md)/31 gr.;
making the total weight of silver vessels 1,393 oz. [Num
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#010.md) dwts. 23, 7/31 gr. The golden
spoons, allowing each to be [Num 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#005.md)
oz. 16 dwts. 3, 3/31 gr., amount to 69 oz. 3 dwts. 13, 5/31 gr. Besides
these, there were for sacrifice -

Lambs 60 Total 240 By this we may at once see, that though the place in
which they now sojourned was a wilderness as to cities, villages, and
regular inhabitants, yet there was plenty of pasturage; else the
Israelites could not have furnished these cattle, with all the
sacrifices necessary for different occasions, and especially for the
passover, which must of itself have required an immense number of lambs,
when each family of 600,000 males was obliged to provide one ([Num
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#001).md).
