wood of Ephraim: The wood of Ephraim was evidently beyond Jordan, and

in the wood, That is, probably, many more were slain in pursuit through
the wood than in the battle, by falling into swamps, pits, etc., and
being entangled and cut down by David's men. Such is the relation of
Josephus; but the Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic state, that they were
devoured by wild beasts in the wood. [Exo

his head: Riding furiously under the thick boughs of a great oak, which
hung low and had never been cropped, either the twisted branches, or
some low forked bough of the tree, caught him by the neck, or, as some
think, by the loops into which his long hair had been pinned, which had
been so much his pride, and was now justly made a halter for him. He may
have hung so low from the bough, in consequence of the length of his
hair, that he could not use his hands to help himself, or so entangled
that his hands were bound, so that the more he struggled the more he was
embarrassed. This set him up as a fair mark to the servants of David;
and although David would have spared his rebellious son, if his orders
had been executed, yet he could not turn the sword of Divine justice, in
executing the just, righteous sentence of death on this traitorous son.

laid: This was the ancient method of burying, whether heroes or
traitors; the heap of stones being designed to perpetuate the memory of
the event, whether good or bad. The Arabs in general make use of no
other monument than a heap of stones over a grave. Thus, in an Arabic
poem, it is related, that Hatim the father, and Adi the grandfather of
Kais, having been murdered, at a time before Kais was capable of
reflection, his mother kept it a profound secret; and in order to guard
him against having any suspicion, she collected a parcel of stone on two
hillocks in the neighbourhood, and told her son that the one was the
grave of his father, and the other of his grandfather. The ancient
cairns in Ireland and Scotland, and the tumuli in England, are of this
kind. [Jos 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#026.md), [Jos

Absalom's place: Josephus says there was in his time, about two furlongs
from Jerusalem, a marble pillar called Absalom's hand, as it is in the
Hebrew (see note on [Sa1 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#012).md); and
there is one shown to the present day, in the valley of Jehoshaphat,
which, though comparatively a modern structure, probably occupies the
site of the original one set up by Absalom. [Gen

to carry the tidings to David. He was an Ethiopian, as his name
signifies, and some think he was so by birth - a black, who waited on
Joab, probably one of the ten who had helped to dispatch Absalom; though
it was dangerous for one of those to bring the news to David, lest his
fate should be the same with theirs that reported the death of Saul and
Ishbosheth to him.
