[2 Corinthians](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001.md)

The most remarkable circumstance in this Epistle, observes Mr. Scott, is
the confidence of the Apostle in the goodness of his cause, and in the
power of God to bear him out in it. Opposed as he then was by a powerful
and sagacious party, whose authority, reputation, and interest were
deeply concerned, and who were ready to seize on every thing that could
discredit him, it is wonderful to hear him so firmly insist upon his
apostolical authority, and so unreservedly appeal to the miraculous
power which he has exercised and conferred at Corinth. So far from
shrinking from the contest, as afraid of some discovery being made,
unfavourable to him and the common cause, he, with great modesty and
meekness indeed, but with equal boldness and decision, expressly
declares that his opposers and despisers were the ministers of Satan,
and menaces them with miraculous judgments, when as many of their
deluded hearers had been brought to repentance and re-established in the
faith, as proper means could in a reasonable time effect. It is
inconceivable that a stronger internal testimony, not only of integrity,
but of divine inspiration, can exist. Had there been anything of
imposture among the Christians, it was next to impossible but such a
conduct must have occasioned a disclosure of it. Of the effects produced
by this latter epistle we have no circumstantial account; for the
journey which St. Paul took to Corinth, after he had written it, is
mentioned by St. Luke only in a few words ([Act
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#002.md), [Act
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#003).md). We know, however, that St. Paul
was there after he had written this Epistle; that the contributions for
the poor brethren at Jerusalem were brought to him from different parts
to that city ([Rom 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#026).md); and that,
after remaining there several months, he sent salutations from some of
the principal members of that church, by whom he must have been greatly
respected, to the church of Rome ([Rom
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#022.md), [Rom
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#023).md). From this time we hear no more
of the false teacher and his party; and when Clement of Rome wrote his
epistle to the Corinthians, St. Paul was considered by them as a divine
apostle, to whose authority he might appeal without fear of
contradiction. The false teacher, therefore, must either have been
silenced by St. Paul, by virtue of his apostolical powers, and by an act
of severity which he had threatened ([Co2
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#002.md), [Co2
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#003).md); or this adversary of the
apostle had, at that time, voluntarily quitted the place. Whichever was
the cause, the effect produced must operate as a confirmation of our
faith, and as a proof of St. Paul's divine mission.
