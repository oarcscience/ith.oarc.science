whose number: This was probably the number returned by Joab and his
assistants, when they made that census of the people with which God was
so much displeased. We find that the effective men of Issachar amounted
to 87,000 ([Ch1 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#005)); 22,600 of whom
descended from Tola his eldest son; but whether the 36,000 ([Ch1
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#004)) were descendants of Tola by Uzzi,
and the 22,600 his descendants by Tola's other sons; or whether another
of Issachar's sons be intended, does not clearly appear; though the
former seems the more obvious meaning. [Ch1
21:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#001), [Ch1
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#001), [Ch1
27:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#023), [Ch1

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 7:6</span></span>

of Benjamin: In the parallel place of Genesis, ten sons of Benjamin are
reckoned, Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim,
and Ard; and in Numbers, five only are mentioned, Bela, Ashbel, Ahiraim,
Shupham, and Hupham; and Ard and Naaman are said to be the sons of Bela,
and consequently Benjamin's grandsons. In the beginning of the following
chapter, also, five are only mentioned, Bela, Ashbel, Aharah, Nohah, and
Rapha; and Addar, Gera, Abihud, Abishua, Naaman, Ahoha, another Gera,
Shephuphan, and Huram, are all represented as grandsons, not sons of
Benjamin. Hence we see that in many cases, grandsons are called sons,
and both are often confounded in the genealogical tables. It seems,
also, that the persons mentioned in the following verses were neither
sons nor grandsons of Bela and Becher, but distinguished persons among
their descendants. [Ch1 8:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#001); [Gen
46:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#021); [Num
26:38-41](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#038)

Ir: [Ch1 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#007), Iri

Aher: Aher signifies another, and it has been conjectured that these
were Danites, "the sons of another tribe;" especially as Hushim is named
as the only son of Dan, [Gen 46:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#023).
And they suppose that the name of Dan was not mentioned, because his
descendants first established idolatry. But Zebulun, as well as Dan, is
here omitted, perhaps because none of either of these tribes returned at
first from Babylon. Though the Benjamites had been almost destroyed in
the first days of the judges, they soon became numerous and powerful.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch1 7:14</span></span>

The sons: The text in these two verses seems to be strangely corrupted;
and, as it stands, is scarcely intelligible. Probably it should be
rendered, "The sons of Manasseh were Ashriel, whom his Syrian concubine
bore to him; and Machir the father of Gilead, whom (his wife) bore to
him. Machir took for a wife Maachah, sister to Huppim and Shuppim." This
is nearly the version of Dr. Geddes.

Machir: [Ch1 2:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#021); [Gen
50:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#023); [Num

Huppim: [Ch1 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#012)

and the name: It is certain that Zelophehad was not a son, but a
descendant of Manasseh's, three generations having intervened; for he
was the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of
Manasseh.

and Zelophehad: [Num 26:33](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#033), [Num

because they came: Or rather, "when כי \[Strong's H3588\], (kee) they
came down to take away their cattle;" for it does not appear that the
sons of Ephraim were the aggressors, but the men of Gath, who appear to
have been born in Egypt. This is the only place in the Sacred Writings
where this piece of history is mentioned, and the transaction seems to
have happened before the Israelites came out of Egypt; for it appears
from the following verse, that Ephraim was alive when these children of
his were slain.

Beriah: that is, In evil

because: Many similar instances of the naming of children from passing
circumstances, occur throughout the sacred volume. See those of a
similar character with this verse: [Gen
35:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#018), where Rachel, while dying,
names her new-born son Ben-oni, or, the son of my sorrow. So in [Sa1
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#021), the wife of Phinehas, on being
apprised of the death of Eli and her husband, and that the ark was taken
by the Philistines, while in the pains of travail, and dying, named her
son I-chabod, or, there is no glory. So also in [Ch1
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#004) of this book, we read that Jabez,
or, sorrowful, had that name given to him, because his mother "bare him
with sorrow." [Sa2 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#005)

Imnah: This variation only exists in the translation; the original being
uniformly Jimnah, or Yimnah. [Gen
