Overview

[Jdg 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#001), The Danites send five men
to seek out an inheritance; [Jdg 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#003),
At the house of Micah they consult with Jonathan, and are encouraged on
their way; [Jdg 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#007), They search
Laish, and bring back news of good hope; [Jdg
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#011), Six hundred men are sent to
surprise it; [Jdg 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#014), In their way
they rob Micah of his priest and his consecrated things; [Jdg
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#027), They win Laish, and call it
Dan; [Jdg 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#030), They set up idolatry,
wherein Jonathan inherits the priesthood.

[Judges 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#001)

no king: The word mailech, which generally means a king, is sometimes
taken for a supreme ruler, governor, or judge (see note on [Gen
36:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#031), and see note on [Deu
33:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#005)); and it is probable it should be
so understood here, and in the parallel passages. [Jdg
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#006), [Jdg

the Lord: As the Levite uses the word Jehovah, and as the Danites
succeeded according to the oracle delivered by him, some learned men are
of opinion, that the worship established by Micah was not of an
idolatrous kind.

[Judges 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jdg 18:7</span></span>

Laish: [Jos 19:47](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#047), called Leshem

how they: [Jdg 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#027), [Jdg

magistrate: Heb. possessor, or, heir of restraint, [Sa1
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#013); [Kg1

13:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#003); [Pe1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#014)

and had no: In the most correct copies of the LXX this clause stands
thus; και λογος ουκ ην αυτοις μετα Συριας; "and they had no transactions
with Syria;" evidently reading instead of אדם \[Strong's H120\], adam,
man, ארם \[Strong's H758\], aram, Syria; words so nearly similar that
the only difference between them is in the ר, raish, and ד, daleth,
which in both manuscripts and printed books is sometimes indiscernible.
Laish was situated on the frontiers of Syria.

lay thine: This was the token of silence. These men were evidently very
ignorant; and absurdly concluded that they should, by taking Micah's
gods, secure the presence and favour of the God of Israel, in their
expedition and settlement. They perhaps supposed the piety of their
motives, and the goodness of their end, would justify the means. But it
was a base robbery of Micah, aggravated by the Levite's ingratitude, and
their menaces. [Job 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#005), [Job

far from: Probably the people of Laish were originally a colony of the
Zidonians; who being an opulent people, and in possession of a strong
city, lived in a state of security, not being afraid of their
neighbours. In this the Leshemites imitated them, though they appear not
to have had the same reason for their confidence; and though they might
naturally expect help from their countrymen, yet as they lived at a
considerable distance from Sidon, the Danites saw they could strike the
blow before the news of the invasion could reach that city. [Jdg

who was: [Gen 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#006), [Gen
32:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#028); Laish, or Dan, was situated at
the northern extremity of the land of Canaan, in a beautiful and fertile
plain, at the foot of mount Lebanon, on the springs of Jordan, and,
according to Eusebius, four miles from Cesarea Philippi, or Paneas, now
Banias (with which some have confounded it), towards Tyre. Burckhardt
says, that the source of the river El Dhan, or Jordan, is at an hour's
distance from Banias, which agrees with Eusebius.

78:58-61](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#058); God had graciously performed
his promise, in putting these Danites in possession of that which fell
to their lot, obliging them thereby to be faithful to him who had been
so to them; they inherited the labour of the people, that they might
observe his statues. [Psa 105:44](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#044), [Psa
105:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#045). But the first thing they do
after they are settled is to break his laws, by setting up the graven
image, attributing their success to that idol, which, if God had not
been infinitely patient, would have been their ruin. Thus a prosperous
idolater goes on to offend, imputing this his power unto his God.
Instead of Manasseh, some would read Moses; as it is found in some
manuscripts, in the Vulgate and in the concessions of the most
intelligent Jews. But Bp. Patrick takes this to be an idle conceit of
the Rabbins, and supposes this Jonathan to be of some other family of
the Levites. Yet Kimchi acknowledges, that the Jews, deeply concerned
for the honour of their lawgiver, to whom they thought it would be a
great dishonour to have a grandson who was an idolater, suspended the
letter, נ, noon, over the word משׁ \[Strong's H4872\], \[Strong's
H4873\], Moses, thus מנשׁה \[Strong's H4519\], as it is found in the
Hebrew Bibles; which, by means of the points, they have changed into
Manasseh.

the land: Houbigant contends, that, instead of haaretz, "the land," we
should read haaron, "the ark;" for the ו, wav, and ן, noon final, might
easily be mistaken for ץ, tzadday final; which is the only difference
between the two words. This conjecture is the more likely, as the next
verse tells us, that Micah's graven image continued at Dan "all the time
that the house of God was at Shiloh;" which was till the ark was taken
by the Philistines.
