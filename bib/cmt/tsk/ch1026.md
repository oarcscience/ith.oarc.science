Overview

[Ch1 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#001.md), The divisions of the
porters; [Ch1 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#013.md), The gates
assigned by lot; [Ch1 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#020.md), The
Levites that had charge of the treasures; [Ch1
26:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#029.md), Officers and judges.

[1 Chronicles 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 26:1</span></span>

the divisions: There were four classes of these, each of which belonged
to the four gates of the temple, which opened to the four cardinal
points of heaven. The eastern gate fell to Shelemiah; the northern to
Zechariah ([Ch1 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#014).md); the southern
to Obed-edom ([Ch1 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#015).md); and the
western to Shuppim and Hosah ([Ch1
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#016).md). These several persons were
captains of these porter-bands, or door-keepers, at the different gates.
There were probably a thousand men under each of these captains; as we
find, from [Ch1 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#005.md), that their whole
number was four thousand.

the porters: [Ch1 9:17-27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#017.md), [Ch1
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#018.md), [Ch1

49:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#001.md) \*titles

Meshelemiah: שׁלמיה \[Strong's H8018\], Shelemiah, is merely an
abbreviation of משׁלמיה \[Strong's H4920\], Meshelemiah, by the
apheresis of מ, mem. [Ch1 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#014.md),
Shelemiah

Asaph: This variation arises from the rejection of the word אב
\[Strong's H1\], av, "father," and the mutation of י, yood, into א,
aleph; being written in the parallel passages אביסף \[Strong's H43\],
Ebiasaph, and here אסף \[Strong's H623\], Asaph. [Ch1
6:37](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#037.md), [Ch1
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#019.md), Ebiasaph

him: "That is, Obed-edom, as [Ch1

mighty men of valour: They were not only porters, or door keepers, in
the ordinary sense of the word, but they were a military guard to the
gate, as Dr. Delaney suggests that the word shoarim should be rendered
here, and perhaps in this sense alone are we to understand their office,
which appears to have been of considerable dignity, and conferred only
on men of the first rank. They were appointed to attend the temple, to
guard all the avenues to it, to open and shut all the outer gates, and
attend at them, not only for state but for service. They were also
required to direct and instruct those who were going to worship in the
courts of the sanctuary in the conduct they were to observe, to
encourage those who were timid, to send back the strangers and unclean,
and to guard against thieves and others who were enemies to the house of
God. [Ch1 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#008.md), [Ch1

wards: That is, classes against each other. Ward formerly signified a
class or division. we still apply the term to the different apartments

place where either the supplies of the porters, or the offerings made

the charge of the treasures, etc., in [Ch2

Shallecheth: That is, ejection; probably the gate through which all the
filth which from time to time might accumulate in the temple and its
courts, was cast out.

causeway: [Kg1 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#005.md); [Ch2
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#004.md)

ward against ward: That is, their stations were opposite to each other;
as the north to the south, and the east to the west. [Ch1

Parbar: i.e. the outside place; he annulled the corn; a quarter of
Jerusalem (Strong), \[Strong's H6503\], [Ch1
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#018.md), Also, [Kg2
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#011.md) Parbar is most probably the same
as parwar, which denotes suburbs ([Kg2
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#011).md), in which sense it is often
used in the Chaldee Targums; and consequently this may be considered as
leading to the suburbs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch1 26:19</span></span>

Shebuel: The difference between שׁובאל \[Strong's H7619\], Shubael, and
שׁבאל \[Strong's H7619\], Shebuel, simply arises from the elision of ו,
wav and a change of vowels. [Ch1

employed as judges with the two tribes and half on the other side of
Jordan, than with all the rest of the tribes; there were two thousand
seven hundred, whereas on the west side of Jordan there were only one
thousand seven hundred. Either those remote tribes were not so well
furnished as the rest with judges of their own, or because they lay
farthest from Jerusalem, on the borders of the neighbouring nations, and
were thus much in danger of being infected with idolatry, they most
needed the help of Levites to prevent their running into the
abominations of the idolaters.
