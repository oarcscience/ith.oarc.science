appointed: Heb. sanctified

Kedesh: Kedesh, called Cadesa, or Caidesa, by Josephus, was situated in
Upper Galilee, twenty miles south-east from Tyre, according to Eusebius.
The cities of refuge were distributed through the land at proper
distances from each other, that they might be convenient to every part
of the land; and it is said they were situated on eminences, that they
might be easily seen at a distance; the roads leading to them being
broad, even, and always kept in good repair. Kedesh and Hebron were at
the two extremities of the land, the former being in Galilee, and the
latter in Judah, both in mountainous districts, and Shechem was in mount
Ephraim, nearly in the centre. Bezer was east of Jordan, in the eastern
part of the plain opposite Jericho; Ramoth was about the midst of the
country of the two tribes and a half, being about the middle of the
mountains of Gilead; and Golan, the capital of Gaulonitis, was situated
in the tribe of Manasseh, in the land of Bashan. As this institution is
considered as a type of Christ, some expositors observe a significancy
in the names of these cities with application to Him as Our Refuge.
Kedesh signifies holy, and our refuge is the holy Jesus. Shechem, a
shoulder, "and the government is upon his shoulder." Hebron, fellowship,
and believers are called into the fellowship of Christ Jesus our Lord.
Bezer, a fortification, for he is a strong hold to all them that trust
in him. Ramoth, high, or exalted, for him hath God exalted with his own
right hand. Golan, joy, or exultation, for in him all the saints are
justified, and shall glory. [Jos
