a rough valley: As the word nachal signifies both a torrent, and the
valley or glen through which it flows, nachal aithan may be rendered a
rapid torrent. Many torrents in Judea are dry during a great part of the
year; when not only their banks but their beds may be ploughed, and
yield a crop. Hence there is no impropriety in specifying that such a
place should be one that "is neither cared nor sown;" while the
circumstance that the elders were to wash their hands over the heifer,
whose head had been struck off into the stream, confirms this
interpretation. The spot of ground where this sacrifice was made must be
uncultivated, because it was considered as a sacrifice for the atonement
of murder, and, consequently, would pollute the land.

and she shall: This was in token of renouncing her religion, and
becoming a proselyte to that of the Jews. This is still a custom in the
East. when a Christian turns Mohammedan, his head is shaved, and he is
carried through the city, crying, la eelah eela allah wemochammed
resoolu7)llahee, "There is no God but the God, and Mohammed is the
prophet of God." [Co1 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#006); [Eph
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#022)

pare her nails: or, suffer to grow, Heb. make, or dress, Weâsethah eth
tzipparneyha, "and she shall make her nails;" i.e., probably neither
paring nor letting them grow, but dressing or beautifying them as the
Eastern women still do by tinging them with the leaves of an odoriferous
plant called alhenna, which Hasselquist (p. 246) informs us, "grows in
India and in upper and lower Egypt, flowering from May to August. The
leaves are pulverized and made into a paste with water. they bind this
paste on the nails of their hands and feet, and keep it on all night.
This gives them a deep yellow, which is greatly admired by Eastern
nations. The colour lasts for three or four weeks before there is
occasion to renew it. The custom is so ancient in Egypt, that I have
seen the nails of mummies dyed in this manner.

[Jos 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#029), [Jos
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#026); So in [Num
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#004), we read, "And the Lord said unto
Moses, Take all the heads (chief men) of the people, and hang them up
before the Lord against the sun, that the fierce anger of the Lord may
be turned away from Israel." Among the Romans, in after ages, they
hanged, or rather fastened to the tree ALIVE; and such was the cruel
death of our blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. [Deu
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#006), [Deu
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#026); [Sa1

worthy of death: Heb. of the judgment of death, The Hebrews understand
this not of putting to death by hanging, but of hanging a man up after
he was stoned to death; which was done more ignominiously of some
heinous malefactors. We have the examples of Rechab and Baanah, who, for
murdering Ish-bosheth, were slain by David's commandment, their hand and
feet cut off, and then hanged up. [Sa2
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#012)

thou hang: [Sa2 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#006), [Sa2

[Deuteronomy 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">deu 21:23</span></span>

he that is hanged is accursed of God: Heb. the curse of God, That is, it
is the highest degree of reproach that can attach to a man, and
proclaims him under the curse of God as much as any external punishment
can. They that see him thus hanging between heaven and earth, will
conclude him abandoned of both, and unworthy of either. Bp. Patrick
observes, that this passage is applied to the death of Christ; not only
because he bare our sins and was exposed to shame, as these malefactors
were that were accursed of God, but because he was in the evening taken
down from the cursed tree and buried (and that by the particular care of
the Jews, with an eye to this law, [Joh
19:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#031)), in token, that now the guilt
being removed, the law was satisfied, as it was when the malefactors had
hanged till sun-set. it demanded no more. Then he, and those that are
his, ceased to be a curse. And as the land of Israel was pure and clean
when the body was buried, so the church is washed and cleansed by the
complete satisfaction which Christ thus made. [Deu
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#026); [Num
