The Book of Joshua is one of the most important documents in the Old
Testament. The rapid conquest of the Promised Land, and the actual
settlement of the Israelites in it, afford a striking accomplishment of
the Divine predictions to Abraham and the succeeding patriarchs; and at
the same time bear the most unequivocal and ample testimony to the
authenticity of this sacred book. Several of the transactions related in
it are confirmed in a very extraordinary manner, by the traditions
current among heathen nations, and preserved by ancient profane
historians of undoubted character. Thus there are monuments still in
existence, which prove that the Carthaginians were a colony of Syrians
who escaped from Joshua; as also that the inhabitants of Leptis, in
Africa, came originally from the Sidonians, who abandoned their country
on account of the calamities with which it was overwhelmed. Procopius
relates that the Phoenicians fled before the Hebrews into Africa, and
spread themselves abroad as far as the pillars of Hercules; and adds,
"In Numidia, where now stands the city Tigisis (Tangiers), they have
erected two columns, on which, in Phoenician characters, is the
following inscription: "We are the Phoenicians who fled from the face of
Jesus (Joshua) the son of Naue" (Nun).
