he brought: As the outward court inclosed the inner, the prophet was led
from the south gate of the outward court to the south gate of the inner,
which was opposite it, and so into the inner court itself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">eze 40:29</span></span>

the little: The entrance into the inner court seems to have been through
a portico, exactly like that at each gate of the outward court; but the
ascent was by eight steps, instead of seven. [Eze

separated the little chambers, or porters' lodges.

five cubits: Instead of five cubits, it seems evident, from the parallel
places, that we should read twenty-five. the word êsrim appears to have
been lost out of the text.

with sculpture, representing leaves or branches of the palm tree.

measured: The north gate, as well as the east, was built in the same
manner, and of the same dimensions, as the south gate. See the parallel
passages.

denotes.

[Ezekiel 40:38](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">eze 40:38</span></span>

the chambers: [Eze 40:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#012.md), [Eze
41:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#010.md),[Eze
41:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#011.md); [Kg1
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#008.md)

where: This place, where the legs and entrails of the sacrifices,
especially of the burnt offerings, were washed, was just within the
portico of the north entrance to the inner court, or court of the
priests. An allusion to this is most probably made by the inspired
apostle when writing his Epistle to the Hebrews ([Heb
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022).md). "Let us draw near with a true
heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an
evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water." [Lev
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#009.md), [Lev

at the side: Two tables were on each side, as you come into the porch of
the gate; and two on each side of the inner part of the gate that looked
towards the altar; in all eight tables, on which they slew and cut up
the victims. It does not appear that any such tables were used either in
the tabernacle or temple; and this seems to intimate the introduction of
a new and more spiritual dispensation. See the references.

chamber: The word chamber probably here denotes a row of chambers, of
which there seems to have been three. one for the singers; one for the
priests who in their courses took charge of the sacred vessels and
treasures; and one for the priests who attended on the altar and
sacrifices.

court: This was the inner court, or court of the priests, which was of
the same dimensions with each division of the outer court; and the altar
stood directly before the porch of the temple.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">eze 40:48</span></span>

the porch: The length of the porch was twenty cubits, the same as the
breadth of the temple, and the breadth eleven cubits, that is, one cubit
more than in Solomon's temple. Two bivalve, or folding doors, each leaf
of them being three cubits wide, seem to have formed the entrance;
which, with five cubits, perhaps of brick or stone work, one each side,
called "the post of the porch," amount to sixteen cubits; and the other
four cubits may be supposed to have been the distance from these posts
to the outside walls of the temple. [Kg1

the visions: There can be little doubt, that the grand outlines of the
description of the temple, in the following extraordinary vision, were
taken from that of Solomon's, with all the additions made to it in after
ages; and we may suppose that Zerubbabel and the other Jews had respect
to it, as far as circumstances would permit, in rebuilding the temple
after the captivity. There are, however, many circumstances which
conclusively shew, that something infinitely superior to either the
first or second temple was intended; and that the external description
must be considered as a figure and emblem of spiritual blessings.
Probably the more immediate accomplishment of the prophecy will be
subsequent to the conversion and restoration of the Jews, the
destruction of Gog and Magog, and the pouring out of the Spirit,
mentioned at the close of the last chapter; but whether there will be
any external forms analogous to these cannot be determined, though in
some respects it seems improbable. [Eze

they three: The entrance into the outer court seems to have been through
a porch with doors at both ends; and on each side of this porch were
three small chambers, or rooms, for the use of the porters, a reed
square in size, with a passage of five cubits between them. The common
cubit, termed the "cubit of a man," ([Deu
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#011).md), was about 18 inches; but the
cubit used by the angel was, as we learn from [Eze
43:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#013.md), "a cubit and a hand breadth,"
or about three inches more than the common cubit, that is 21 inches.
Hence the measuring reed, which was "six cubits long, by the cubit and
the hand breadth," ([Eze 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#005).md), must
have been about 10+ feet

cubits ([Eze 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#007).md); the spaces before
the rooms, or two cubits ([Eze 40:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#012).md);
and the breadth of the entrance, ten cubits ([Eze

one cubit for the thickness of the walls. [Eze
