stones of ten cubits: Reckoning the cubit at 21 inches, the ten cubits
are 17 feet and a half, and the eight cubits are 14 feet. The magnitude
of these stones was certainly extraordinary; but let us hear M. Volney,
and our surprise will no longer be fixed on these stones, but
transferred from Solomon's house to the ruins of Balbec: "What is still
more astonishing is the enormous stones which compose the sloping wall.
To the west, the second layer is formed of stones which are from 28 to
35 feet long, by about 9 in height. Over this layer, at the north-west
angle, there are three stones, which alone occupy a space of 175 feet
and a half; viz. the first, 58 feet 7 inches; the second, 58 feet 11
inches; and the third, exactly 58 feet; and each of these is 12 feet
thick. These stones are of white granite, with large shining flakes,
like gypsum: there is a quarry of this kind of stone under the whole
city, and another in the adjacent mountains, which is open in several
places. On the right, as we approach the city, there is still lying
there a stone hewn on three sides, which is 69 feet 2 inches long, 12
feet 10 inches broad, and 13 feet 3 inches in thickness.

a widow's son: Heb. the son of a widow woman

tribe: The mother of Hiram (not the Tyrian king mentioned before, but an
intelligent coppersmith, of Jewish extraction by his mother's side) in
Chronicles, is said to have been of "the daughters of Dan;" and she
might have been of Naphtali by her father, and of Dan by her mother; or
she might originally be of the tribe of Dan, and have been first married
to a man of the tribe of Naphtali; and, in either case, she might be
indifferently called "of the tribe of Naphtali," or of "the daughters of
Dan."

Naphtali: [Ch2 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#014)

25:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#017); [Ch2
3:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#015), [Ch2
4:12-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#012); [Jer
52:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#021)

eighteen cubits: That is, nearly thirty feet, English measure. But in
the parallel place in Chronicles, these pillars are said to thirty-five
cubits high. Tremellius reconciles this difference by observing, that
the common cubit was but one-half of the cubit of the sanctuary; so that
eighteen of the one would make thirty-six of the other; from which, if
we deduct one cubit for the base, there will remain thirty-five.
Notwithstanding the names of these pillars, they seem to have supported
no part of the building, and appear to have been formed for ornament;
and were no doubt also emblematical. The right pillar was called Jachin,
which signifies, "He will establish;" while that on the left was named
Boaz, "In it is strength." Some think they were intended for memorials
of the pillars and cloud of fire, which led Israel through the
wilderness; but Henry supposes them designed for memorandums to the
priests and others that came to worship at God's door.

1st. To depend upon God only, and not upon any sufficiency of their own,
for strength and establishment in all their religious exercises.

2nd. It was a memorandum to them of the strength and establishment of
the temple of God among them.

When the temple was destroyed, particular notice is taken of the
breaking up and carrying away of these brazen pillars, [Kg2
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#013), [Kg2
25:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#017), which had been the tokens of
its establishment, and would have been still so, if they had not
forsaken God.

it contained: This immense laver, called a sea from it magnitude, held,
at a moderate computation, 16,000 gallons. Besides this great brazen
laver, there were in the temple ten lavers of brass of a less size,
which moved on wheels, and were ornamented with the figures of various
animals, having, probably, always some relation to the cherubim. These
lavers were to hold water for the use of the priests in their sacred
office, particularly to wash the victims that were to be offered as a
burnt offering, as we learn from [Ch2
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#006); but the brazen sea was for the
priests to wash in. The knops are supposed to have been in the form of
an ox's head ([Ch2 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#003)); and some
think the water flowed out at their mouths.

bases was on: It seems evident that these bases or pedestals rose with
steps, and that the ornaments mentioned in the next verse appeared in
front, forming so many entablatures. But the description of these bases
is very difficult to comprehend: many of the original words are seldom,
if at all, used elsewhere; and it would be impossible to give an
explanation of each particular, without a labour and prolixity
disproportioned to its importance to us. [Kg1

Succoth: [Gen 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#017)

Zarthan: Zarthan is supposed to have been situated in the tribe of
Manasseh, west of Jordan, near Jezreel and Bethshan or Scythopolis, and
not far from the Jordan. Succoth we know was situated east of Jordan, in
the tribe of Gad, and according to Jerome, in the district of
Scythopolis. hence the "plain of Jordan," where Hiram cast the brazen
vessels, must be the plain in which that river runs, Zarthan and Succoth
being probably nearly opposite each other; but whether the precise spot
of his operations was on this side or the other side, is uncertain. In
this place he found that particular clay that was proper for his
purpose; and it being a considerable distance from Jerusalem, that city
would not be annoyed by the smoke and noxious vapours necessarily
occasioned by the process. [Kg1 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#012),
