Is not this David: These words seem to mark no definite time; and may be
understood thus: "Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of
Israel, who has been with me for a considerable time?"

Make this fellow: The princes reasoned wisely, according to the common
practice of mankind; and it was well for David that they were such good
politicians. it was ordered by a gracious Providence that they refused
to let David go with them to this battle, in which he must have been
either an enemy to his country, or false to his friends and to his
trust. Had he fought for the Philistines, he would have fought against
God and his country; and had he in the battle gone over to the
Israelites, he would have deceived and become a traitor to the
hospitable Achish. God therefore delivered him from such disgrace; and
by the same kind Providence he was sent back to rescue his wives, and
the wives and children of his people, from captivity. [Sa1

Jezreel: Jezreel, or Esdrelon, was a city of Issachar, afterwards
celebrated as the residence of the kings of Israel, delightfully
situated in the extensive and fertile plain of the same name, which
extends from Scythopolis or Bethshan on the east to mount Carmel on the
west. Eusebius and Jerome inform us, that it was in their time a place
of considerable consequence, lying between Scythopolis on the east and
Legio on the west; and the latter (on [Hos
1:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001).md). informs us that it was pretty
near Maximianopolis. The Jerusalem Itinerary places it ten miles west
from Scythopolis; and William of Tyre says it was called Little Gerinum
in his time, and that there was a fine fountain in it, whose waters fell
into the Jordan near Scythopolis. See note on [Sa1
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#001.md).
