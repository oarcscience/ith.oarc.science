### [Psalms Chapter 140](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 140:0</span></span>

This Psalm is in its proper place, and so fitly follows [Psa
139:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#001.md) that you might almost read right
on, and make no break between the two. Serious injury would follow to
the whole Book of Psalms if the order should be interferred with as
certain wiseacres propose. It is the cry of a hunted soul, the
supplication of a believer incessantly persecuted and beset by cunning
enemies, who hungered for his destruction. David was hunted like a
partridge upon the mountains, and seldom obtained a moment's rest. This
is his pathetic appeal to Jehovah for protection, an appeal which
gradually intensifies into a denunciation of his bitter foes. With this
sacrifice of prayer he offers the salt of faith; for in a very marked
and emphatic manner he expresses his personal confidence in the Lord as
the protector of the oppressed, and as his own God and Defender. Few
short Psalms are so rich in the jewelry of precious faith.

"To the Chief Musician." - The writer wished this experimental hymn to
be under the care of the chief master of song, that it might neither be
left unsung, nor chanted in a slovenly manner. Such trials and such
rescues deserved to be had in remembrance, and to be set up among the
choicest memorials of the Lord's goodness. We too, have our songs which
are of no ordinary kind, and these must be sung with our best powers of
heart and tongue. We will offer them to the Lord by no other hand than
that of "the Chief Musician."

"A Psalm of David." - The life of David wherein he comes in contact with
Saul and Doeg is the best explanation of this Psalm; and surely there
can be no reasonable doubt that David wrote it, and wrote it in the time
of his exile and peril. The tremendous outburst at the end has in it the
warmth which was so natural to David, who was never lukewarm in
anything; \[let it is to be noticed that concerning his enemies he was
often hot in language through indignation, and yet he was cool in
action, for he was not revengeful. His was no petty malice, but a
righteous anger, he foresaw, foretold, and even desired the just
vengeance of God upon the proud and wicked, and yet he would not avail
himself of opportunities to revenge himself upon those who had done him
wrong. It mail be that his appeals to the great King cooled his anger,
and enabled him to leave his wrongs unredressed by any personal act of
violence. "Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord"; and David
when most wounded by undeserved persecution and wicked falsehood was
glad to leave his matters at the foot of the throne, where they would be
safe with the King of kings.

Hints to Preachers

[Psa 140:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#001.md). -

I. The particular source of David's affliction, it was from men. In this
he was a type of Christ.

1\. Their wickedness: "the evil man."

2\. Their violence: "the violent man."

3\. Their malicious designs: "which imagine mischiefs in their heart."

4\. Their confederacy, "continually are they gathered together for war."

5\. Their false accusations: "They have sharpened their tongues like a
serpent," etc. ([Psa 140:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#003).md).

6\. Their avowed design, "they have purposed to overthrow my goings"
([Psa 140:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#004).md).

7\. Their intrigues ([Psa 140:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#005).md).

II\. His universal remedy, "Deliver me, O Lord"; "preserve" and help me.
His defence is,

1\. In God.

2\. In prayer to God. - G. R.

[Psa 140:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#001.md). - In our position, age,
and country, we are not in danger of violence from men, as was David,
still, no man is absolutely safe from the danger.

I. Mention some cases not yet impossible.

1\. A Christian workman, because he cannot comply with unrighteous
customs, excites the animosity of his fellow workers. They will do him
mischief, spoil his work, steal his tools, speak evil of him, until his
employer discharges him to restore peace in the factory.

2\. A Christian clerk or shop assistant, because his presence is a check
upon his sinful companions, may have snares laid for him, etc.

II\. Suggest advice, useful, should such a case arise.

1\. Resort to God with a "Deliver me," and a "Preserve me."

2\. Maintain integrity and uprightness.

3\. Should the mischievous ones succeed, still trust in God, who can
make their mischief lead to your profit, and make his goodness outwit
their devices. - J. F.

[Psa 140:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#003.md). - The depraved state of
the natural man as to his speech.

[Psa 140:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#004) (first clause.md). - A wise
prayer. The wicked will slander, and oppress, or mislead, flatter and
defile. No one can keep us but the Lord.

[Psa 140:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#005.md). - The Dangers of Society.

I. The secrecy of the attacks of the ungodly: "hid a snare."

II\. The variety of their weapons: "and cords."

III\. The cunning choice of position: "by the wayside."

IV\. The object of their designs: "for me": they desire to destroy the
man himself.

[Psa 140:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#005.md). - "The Net by the
Wayside," or, covert temptations', temptations brought near, and made
applicable to daily life.

[Psa 140:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#006.md). -

I. The language of assurance.

II\. The plea for acceptance in prayer.

[Psa 140:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#006.md), [Psa
140:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#007.md). - David comforted himself,

I. In his interest in God, "I said ... thou art my God."

II\. In his access to God, he had leave to speak to him, and might
expect an answer of peace: "Hear," etc.

III\. In the assurance he had of help from God, and happiness in him
([Psa 140:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#007).md).

IV\. In the experience he had formerly of God's care of him: "Thou hast
covered my head in the day of battle." - Matthew Henry.

[Psa 140:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#006.md). - Three arguments to be
pleaded in a prayer for protection.

I. The believer's covenanted property in God. "I said ... thou art my
God."

II\. The past mercies of God. "Thou hast covered," etc.

III\. The impropriety of the wicked being encouraged in their
wickedness, [Psa 140:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#008.md). - J. F.

[Psa 140:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#006.md), [Psa
140:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#007.md). - The Consolations of the
Believer in Time of Trouble.

I. What he can say.

II\. What he can remember.

III\. What he is assured of.

[Psa 140:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#006.md), [Psa
140:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#007.md), [Psa
140:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#012.md), [Psa
140:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#013.md). - Times of Assault, Slander,
and Temptation should be special times of Prayer and Faith. David here
makes prominent five things.

I. Possession asserted.

1\. The Possession, "My God." Opposed to idols. Beloved by self.

2\. The Claim published.

3\. The Witness selected. Secret. Sacred. Searching.

4\. The Occasion chosen.

II\. Petition presented.

1\. His prayers were frequent.

2\. His prayers were full of meaning.

3\. His prayers were meant for God.

4\. His prayers needed divine attention.

III\. Preservation experienced.

1\. God had been his Armour-bearer.

2\. God had guarded his most vital part.

3\. God had saved him.

4\. God's strength had been displayed.

IV\. Protection expected.

1\. God is a righteous Judge.

2\. God is a compassionate Friend.

3\. God is a well-known Guardian.

V. Praise predicted.

1\. Praise assured by gratitude.

2\. Praise expressed by words.

3\. Praise implied in confidence.

4\. Praise practised by communion.

[Psa 140:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#009.md). - How the sin of
evil-speakers comes home to them. - W. B. H.

[Psa 140:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#011) (first clause.md). -

I. Notice a few varieties of evil speakers,

1\. Liars the common liar, the trade liar, the stock-exchange liar, the
political liar, etc.

2\. Scandal-mongers.

3\. Blasphemers and swearers.

4\. Libertines and seducers.

5\. Sceptics and new theology inventors.

II\. The propriety of the prayer.

1\. Because evil speaking is intrinsically an evil thing.

2\. It is an extensively injurious thing.

3\. He who would have God's truth established must needs desire that
evil speaking must fail.

III\. The limitation of the prayer, "In the earth."

1\. It is certain an evil speaker cannot be established in heaven, nor
in hell.

2\. The earth is the only sphere of his influence; but, alas! men on the
earth are too prone to be Influenced by him.

3\. Then, become righteous and true, by faith in the Righteous One and
the "Truth." - J. F.

[Psa 140:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#011) (second clause.md). - The
Cruel Hunter pursued by his own Dogs.

[Psa 140:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#011) (second clause.md). - Theme -
Sins committed, and not repented of, pursue men to their ruin.

I. Illustrate.

1\. They may raise a force of opposition from men. Tarquin, Napoleon,
etc.

2\. They may precipitate ruin, as Haman was hunted by his own sin to the
gallows.

3\. They may arouse destructive remorse, as in Judas.

4\. Certainly they will pursue to the judgment-seat, and hunt the soul
into hell.

II\. Apply.

1\. How fearful a thing must sin be.

2\. The more terrible because self-created.

3\. Flee from the avenging pursuers to Christ, the only and safe refuge.
- J. F.

[Psa 140:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#011) (second clause.md). - The
hunt and pursuit of the violent sinner.

I. The progress of the chase.

1\. At first the victim is ignorant of it.

2\. But ere long he finds Scripture, conscience, God, Death, at his
heels.

3\. His own sins cry loudest after him.

II\. The issue of the hunt. Hemmed in, overthrown, lost for ever, unless
he repent.

III\. Another Huntsman. "The Son of man is come to seek and save that
which was lost." - W. B. H.

[Psa 140:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#012.md). -

I. The known fact.

II\. The reasons for being so assured of it.

III\. The conduct arising out of the knowledge.

[Psa 140:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#012.md). - Something worth
knowing.

I. By the afflicted and the poor who trust in the Lord.

II\. By the oppressors who afflict and do the wrong.

III\. By all men, that they may trust in the Lord, and praise him for
his compassion towards the needy, and for his even-handed justice. - J.
F.

[Psa 140:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#012.md), [Psa
140:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#013.md). -

I. Trust under all circumstances ([Psa
140:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#012).md).

II\. Gratitude for all things: "The righteous shall give thanks unto thy
name."

III\. Safety at all times: "The upright shall dwell in thy presence." -
G. R.

[Psa 140:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#013.md). - One of the noblest
forms of praise, - dwelling in the presence of God. Or, reverent regard
to God's presence, holy communion with the Lord, confiding rest in God's
dealings, obedient doing of the heavenly will - the best way of giving
thanks to God.

[Psa 140:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#013.md). - Two assertions beyond
contradiction.

I. The righteous are sure to give thanks to God, let others be as
thankless as they will. For,

1\. They recognise all their good as coming from God.

2\. They realise themselves as unworthy of the good they receive.

3\. They are anxious to do right, because they are righteous; and that
involves thanksgiving.

4\. Thankfulness is a part of the joy derived from what they enjoy.

II\. The upright are sure to dwell in God's presence.

1\. In the sense of setting the Lord before them.

2\. In the sense of an abiding, present fellowship with God.

3\. In the sense of enjoying God's approval.

4\. In the sense of dwelling in heaven for ever - J. F.

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Whole Psalm

Another Psalm "of David," to be sung by all saints, even as it was used
by their Head, David's Son. In it we have ([Psa
140:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#001).md) the picture of the wicked,
with a "Selah," that bids us pause over its dark colours. Then we have
([Psa 140:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#004.md), [Psa
140:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#005).md) a view of the snares spread by
the wicked, with another "Selah"-pause. Thereafter, we see a soul in the
attitude of faith ([Psa 140:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#006).md). They
are laying the snares, but calm as Elisha beholding the Syrian host
assembling ([Kg2 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#015).md), the stayed
soul sings -

"I have said to the Lord, My God art thou;"

and then he prays, putting a "Selah" at the close, that we may again
pause and survey the scene. - Andrew A. Bonar.

Whole Psalm

There is no doubt that this Psalm expresses the feelings of David on the
first intelligence of Saul's setting out anew in pursuit of him (comp.
[Psa 140:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#002).md). And then, in [Psa
141:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#001.md) we have his supplication at
the time when this danger was ever approaching nearer. Various things
are said in this Psalm (according to the Hebrew) primarily of a single
person, (Saul:) thus e.g., [Psa 140:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#001.md),
[Psa 140:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#004.md); and the numerous tongues
of which David complains ([Psa 140:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#003).md)
are just the tongues of traitors who again informed Saul of this new
place of residence in the wilderness of Engedi, where he might have
imagined himself so secure. The laying of snares ([Psa
140:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#005).md) agrees perfectly in part with
this treachery, and in part with the search after David by Saul and his
numerous army, mentioned in [Sa1 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#002.md).
In the same way might the burning coals, spoken of in [Psa
140:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#010.md), and likewise the deep pits
(German, floods) mentioned there, have suggested themselves most
naturally to David upon the rocks of Engedi, where he had the Dead Sea
just before him. [Psa 140:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#010.md) seems
also to allude to the events which happened on the night before the
destruction of Sodom. - T. G. Barth, in "The Bible Manual."

Whole Psalm

As in [Psa 138:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#001.md). David set before
his seed God's promise as the anchor of hope (2 Sam. 7); and in Psalm
139, God's omniscience as our consolation in danger and motive for
shunning evil; so in this Psalm he sets forth the danger from calumnious
enemies, and our only safety in Jehovah, our strength. - Andrew Robert
Fausset.

[Psa 140:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#001.md), [Psa
140:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#004.md), [Psa
140:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#006.md), [Psa
140:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#008.md)

Good men live by prayer. He who gets to the throne of grace is covered
by the cloud of glory, through which no sun can smite by day, nor moon
by night. - William Swan Plumer.

[Psa 140:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#001.md), [Psa
140:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#007.md)

On the first reading of this Psalm one is inclined to think that there
is somewhat of fierceness and bitterness in it, which is hardly
consistent with the character of a child of God, and therefore
unbecoming in David.... And yet I really think that a little more
examination of the language of this Psalm will lead us to believe that
we are doing David wrong in affixing anything like a meaning or desire
of vindictiveness to his words.

Assuredly we can find no fault with one who takes his wrongs in prayer
to God; who, like Hezekiah, takes the roll of his cares, and sorrows,
and trials, and spreads it before the Lord. And this is what David does
in [Psa 140:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#001.md), "Deliver me, O Lord,
from the evil man; preserve me from the violent man." I do not think a
person who does this, who, when smarting under a sense of injury and
wrong, goes at once to God and lays open his heart to him, is likely to
go very far wrong; for even though he may have begun in somewhat of an
unkindly spirit, yet prayer opens before us such a sight and sense of
our own guiltiness and wrongs towards God, and thereby exercises such an
abusing, as well as healing and soothing, influence over our feelings
towards others, that we might almost be assured that he whose prayer
might begin even with a vehement enumeration of his own wrongs, would
end with something very like a determination to bless them that cursed,
and to do good to them that hated him.

You will observe, too, how, from first to last, David leaves his cause
in God's hands; it is not "my sword and my bow that shall help me;" he
counted them vain things to help a man; and therefore, as he had so
often said in other Psalms; "The Lord was his shield and his defence,"
and as God had already shielded his head in the day of battle, so he
prays for the same protection against his enemies now. - Barton
Bouchier.

[Psa 140:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#001.md), [Psa
140:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#011.md)

Three special forms of Satanic energy are individualized. The evil or
wicked man, the violent man, and the man of tongue are severally
appealed from by the suppliant speaker of the prayer of faith. - Arthur
Pridham.

[Psa 140:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#002.md)

"Continually are they gathered together for war." Literally, this clause
reads, "who gather wars," and so some understand it. But it is well
known that the prepositions are often omitted in the Hebrew, and no
doubt he means that they stirred up general enmity by their false
information which acted as a trumpet sounding to battle. - John Calvin.

[Psa 140:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#002.md), [Psa
140:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#003.md)

The wicked assault the righteous with three weapons - with the heart, by
conspiracy; with the tongue, by lying; and with the hand, by violence. -
John Lorinus, 1569-1634.

[Psa 140:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#003.md)

"They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent." To sharpen or whet
the tongue imports the keenest and extremest kind of talkativeness, much
more to sharpen the tongue "like a serpent." Naturalists tell us that no
living creature stirs his tongue so swiftly as a serpent, and serpents
are therefore said to have a treble tongue, because, moving their
tongues so fast, they seem to have three tongues. The Psalmist means -
the wicked speak thick and threefold, they sting and poison me with
their tongues. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 140:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#003.md)

"They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent." This is an exact
description of the way in which a serpent darts out his tongue before he
inflicts the wound. See him: his head is erect, and his piercing eye is
wildly and fiercely fixed on the object; the tongue rapidly appears and
disappears, as if by that process it would be sharpened for the contest.
Thus were the enemies of David making sharp their tongues for his
destruction. - Joseph Roberts, in "Oriental Illustrations of the Sacred
Scriptures," 1835.

[Psa 140:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#003.md)

"They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent," etc. Is it not a
fact, that there are many men, the very existence of whom is a baneful
poison, as it were? They dart their livid tongue like the tongue of a
serpent; and the venom of their disposition corrodes every object upon
which it concentrates itself; ever vilifying and maligning, like the
ill-omened bird of night. - Pliny.

[Psa 140:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#003.md)

"They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent." As the adder
skilfully prepares herself for her work of death, so do the unhappy
children of slander and falsehood prepare themselves, by every possible
effort, for injuring their unoffending victims. - John Morison.

[Psa 140:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#003.md)

In St. James's day, as now, it would appear that there were idle men and
idle women, who went about from house to house, dropping slander as they
went, and yet you could not take up that slander and detect the
falsehood there. You could not evaporate the truth in the slow process
of the crucible, and then show the residuum of falsehood glittering and
visible. You could not fasten upon any word or sentence, and say that it
was calumny; for in order to constitute slander, it is not necessary
that the word spoken should be false - half-truths are often more
calumnious than whole falsehoods. It is not even necessary that a word
should be distinctly uttered; a dropped lip, an arched eyebrow, a
shrugged shoulder, a significant look, an incredulous expression of
countenance, nay, even an emphatic silence, may do the work; and when
the light and trifling thing which has done the mischief has fluttered
off, the venom is left behind, to work and rankle, to inflame hearts, to
fever human existence, and to poison human society at the fountain
springs of life. Very emphatically was it said by one whose whole being
had smarted under such affliction, "Adders' poison is under their lips."
- Frederick William Robertson.

[Psa 140:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#003.md)

Slander and calumny must always precede and accompany persecution,
because malice itself cannot excite people against a good man, as such;
to do this, he must first be represented as a bad man. What can be said
of those who are busied in this manner, but that they are a "generation
of vipers," the brood of the old "Serpent," that grand accuser and
calumniator of the brethren, having under their tongues a bag of
"poison." conveying instant death to the reputation on which they
fasten. Thus David was hunted as a rebel, Christ was crucified as a
blasphemer, and the primitive Christians were tortured as guilty of
incest and murder. - George Horne.

[Psa 140:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#003.md)

Man consists of soul and body; the body is but the shadow, or at best
but the bearer of the soul - it's the soul that bears God's image, it's
the soul especially for which Christ died. Now, by how much the soul is
more precious than the body, by so much are the helps more excellent,
and the enemies more dangerous than the body's. The body is fed with
meat; but it is perishing meat ([Co1
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#013).md); but the food of the soul is the
heavenly manna ([Joh 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#027).md).
Answerably, the enemies are more hurtful, for that that hurts or kills
the body toucheth not the soul; but what hurts or kills the soul kills
the body with it, and destroys the whole man. The conclusion is, that
therefore the bane or poison of the soul is much more hideous, horrible
and hateful than that of the body; and of that poison speaks the present
Scripture, "adders' poison is under their lips."

A strange text some may say, and 'tis true; but it is the fitter for
these strange times, wherein the poison both of soul and body so far
prevails. The words do describe in part the malignant and malicious
nature of the unregenerate and sinful man; and to that purpose are they
cited by the apostle to the Romans ([Rom
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#013).md). The asp is but a little
creature; but not a little poisonful. So little a creature hath been the
bane and death of many a great person; let one suffice for all. That
royal and renowned Cleopatra, queen of Egypt, chose rather to die by the
biting of two asps than to be carried in triumph at Rome by Augustus.
The manner of their poisoning is this, robe that is bitten by the asp
falls forthwith into a gentle sweat and a sweet sleep, and his strength
and vital spirits decay and weaken by little till he die; thus the
present pain is little, but the stroke is deadly. And even such stings
are the tongues, and such swords the words of wicked men. And no marvel;
for what can come but poisonful words and actions from them whose very
inward nature is all poison within t

The poison of the soul is only sin, and this is like to poison in many
respects. Poison, wherever it enters, stays not there, but diffuseth
itself all over the body, and never ceaseth till it has infected all.
Such is the nature of sin; enter where it will it creeps from one member
of the body to another, and from the body to the soul, till it has
infected the whole man; and then from man to man, till the whole
family.; and stays not there, but runs like a wildfire, from family to
family, till it has poisoned a whole town, and so a whole country, and a
whole kingdom. Woeful experience proves this true, both for Popish
opinions, idle fashions, vain customs, and ill-examples of all sorts,
which once set on foot, spread themselves over the politic body of
church and commonwealth, like a gangrene or a leprosy over the natural
body or like a poison through all the blood. Poison, having entered
anywhere, as it seeks to creep presently over all, so desires it
especially to seize upon the heart; such a malice and pride lies in the
malignant nature of it, that it aspires to the heart; and such a craft
and cunning lurks in it, that having once entered, it creeps closely and
unfelt till it gets to the heart; but having possessed itself of that
sovereign part of man, then like a tyrant it reigns and rages, and
infecting first the vital blood and noble parts, it diffuseth itself
over all and every part. And such is the nature of sin, the spiritual
poison of the soul; enter where it will, it is the heart it aims at, and
it will never stay till it come there. The truth of this is so clear
that proofs are needless; for who knows not that the senses are but the
doors or windows, but the heart is the throne, and the soul itself the
seat of sin: and hence it is that Solomon adviseth, - "My son, keep thy
heart with all diligence": [Pro 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#023.md).
- William Crashaw, in "The Parable of Poyson," 1618.

[Psa 140:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#003.md)

"Adders' poison is under their lips." The word rendered "adder,"
עכשׁוּב, achsub, occurs here only; and it is perhaps impossible to
determine what species is intended. As the word, in its proper
signification, seems to express coiling, or bending back - an act common
to most serpents - the name has perhaps no determinate reference; or it
may be another name for the pethen, mentioned under Job 20; which seems
also to have been the opinion of the Seventy, as they render both words
by ἀσπίς, and are followed by the Vulgate (aspis).

As to the poison, it will be observed, that in the venomous serpents
there is a gland under the eye secreting the poisonous matter, which is
conveyed, in a small tube or canal, to the end of a fang which lies
concealed at the roof of the mouth. This fang is moveable at the
pleasure of the serpent, and is protruded when it is about to strike at
an antagonist. The situation of this poison, which is, in a manner,
behind the upper lip, gives great propriety to the expression, "adders'
poison is under their lips." The usage of the Hebrew language renders it
by no means improbable that the fang itself is called לשׁון lashon, a
tongue, in the present text; and a serpent might then be said to sharpen
its tongue, when, in preparing to strike, it protruded its fangs. We do
not see any explanation by which a more consistent meaning may be
extracted from the expression here employed. - John Kitto, in the
"Pictorial Bible."

[Psa 140:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#003.md)

Often the tongue of the serpent is spoken of as the seat of its venom.
This is popular, not scientific language. - William Swan Plumer.

[Psa 140:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#003.md)

"Adder." The word acshub (pronounced ak-shoob), only occurs in this one
passage. The precise species represented by this word, is unknown.
Buxtorf, however, explains the word as the Spitter, "illud genus quod
venenum procul exspuit." Now, if we accept this derivation, we must take
the word acshub as a synonym for pethen. We have already identified the
Pethen with the Naja haje, a snake which has the power of expelling the
poison to some distance, when it is out of reach of its enemy. Whether
the snake really intends to eject the poison, or whether it is merely
flung from the hollow fangs by the force of the suddenly-checked stroke,
is uncertain. That the Haje cobra can expel its poison is an
acknowledged fact, and the Dutch colonists of the Cape have been so
familiarly acquainted with this habit, that they have called this
reptile by the name of Spuugh-Slange, or Spitting-Snake, a name which,
if we accept Buxtorf's etymology, is precisely equivalent to the word
acshub. - J. G. Wood, in "Bible Animals."

"Selah." We meet with Selah here for the first time since Psalm 89. From
Psalm 90 to [Psa 140:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#001.md) no Selah
occurs. Why omitted in these fifty we cannot tell any more than why so
often recurring in others. However, there are only about forty Psalms in
all in which it is used. - Andrew A. Bonar.

[Psa 140:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#004.md)

"Keep me," etc. From doing as they do, or as they would have me do, or
as they promise themselves I will do. - Matthew Henry.

[Psa 140:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#004.md)

"Preserve me from the violent man." The second clause of the first
versicle of this verse is the same as the second versicle of [Psa
140:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#001.md), which seems the burden of the
song. - "Speaker's Commentary."

[Psa 140:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#004.md)

"To overthrow my goings." To take my feet from under me, to destroy the
basis of belief, the power of advance in good works, that we may turn
back from the way of salvation, or fall upon it, or, at any rate, may go
very slowly along it. - Neale and Littledale.

[Psa 140:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#005.md)

"The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords." The following story
illustrates how cords have been used by thieves so lately as the year
1822: - "Two skilful leaders of Dacoits, having collected some forty
followers, and distributed among them ten matchlocks, ten swords, and
twenty-five spears, waylaid a treasure going from the native Collector's
treasury at Budrauna to Goruckpore. The prize consisted of 1,200, and
was guarded by a Naik, or corporal, with four sepoys and five troopers.
It had to pass through a dense jungle, and it was settled - said one of
them in after years - 'that the attack should take place there; that we
should have strong ropes tied across the road in front and festooned to
trees on both sides, and, at a certain distance behind, similar ropes
festooned to trees on one side, and ready to be fastened on the other,
as soon as the escort of horse and foot should get well in between
them.' Having completed these preparations the gang laid down on either
side of the road patiently awaiting their prey. 'About five in the
morning,' continued the narrator, 'we heard a voice as if calling upon
the name of God (Allah), and one of the gang started up at the sound and
said, "Here comes the treasure!" We put five men in front with their
matchlocks loaded - not with ball but shot, that we might, if possible,
avoid killing anybody. When we got the troopers, infantry, and treasure
all within the space, the hind ropes were run across the road, and made
fast to the trees on the opposite side, and we opened a fire in upon the
party from all sides. The foot soldiers got into the jungle at the sides
of the road, and the troopers tried to get over the ropes at both ends,
but in vain.' The corporal and a horse were killed; two troopers
wounded, and the treasure carried off in spite of a hot pursuit." - From
James Hutton's "Popular Account of the Thugs and Dacoits of India,"
1857.

[Psa 140:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#005.md)

"The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords." There was "a trap hidden
for him with cords;" a trap being sunk into some frequented path, and
always covered over with grass or brushwood, and having long cords
attached to each side, by which the hunter, lurking at a little
distance, might close it whenever he saw the game stepping on the spot.
But the net spread for him by his enemies extended to the very "side of
the encampment," which indicates, that even among the soldiers lying
around him there were some who had been bribed and persuaded to watch
and betray him. - Benjamin Weiss, in "A New Translation of the Psalms,
with Notes," 1858.

[Psa 140:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#005.md)

"Snare." "Net." "Gins." The several uses to which the contrivances
denoted by the Hebrew words thus rendered were respectively applied, do
not appear to be well ascertained. In general the Psalmist alludes to
the artifices employed for capturing birds or beasts. It is, however, a
curious circumstance, as noticed by Thevenot, that artifices of this
kind are literally employed against men as well as other animals by some
of the Orientals. "The cunningest robbers in the world," says he, "are
in this country. They use a certain slip with a running noose, which
they cast with so much sleight about a man's neck when they are within
reach of him, that they never fail, so that they strangle him in a
trice." - Richard Mant.

[Psa 140:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#006.md)

"The voice of my supplications." The one safety for simple and unlearned
people when assailed by the crafty arguments of heretics and infidels is
not controversy, but prayer, a weapon their adversaries seldom use, and
cannot understand - Bruno of Aste, 1123.

[Psa 140:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#007.md)

"Thou hast covered my head in the day of battle." Hebrew, of armour. For
David had never indeed any battle with Saul, but declined it; but Saul
often armed against him; but then God's providence covered him as a
shield: but the head is only spoken of to set forth his whole body,
because that is chiefly aimed at by the enemy, as where the life
principally lieth. - John Meyer.

[Psa 140:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#007.md)

"Thou hast covered my head," etc. That is, I had no other helmet or
armour but thy Almighty power in the day when I fought with Goliath.
[Sa1 17:39](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#039.md), [Sa1
17:40](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#040.md), [Sa1
17:50](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#050.md). - Thomas Fenton.

[Psa 140:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#007.md)

"Thou hast covered my head in the day of battle." A captain or prince
had always beside him in battle an armour-bearer, whose duty it was "to
cover his master's head," that is, to ward off with the shield the blows
aimed at his head, and which, in the heat of the fight, had escaped his
own notice. - Benjamin Weiss.

[Psa 140:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#008.md)

"His wicked device"; which is to destroy me. "Exalt themselves"; not
only against me, but against thee also, as if by their power and policy
they had frustrated thy design and promise made to me. - M. Pool.

[Psa 140:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#009.md)

"As for the head of those that compass me about," etc. God, he saith,
had covered his head in the day of battle: now contrariwise he showeth
what should cover the head of his enemies, viz., it should come to them
as with their lips they had maliciously spoken against him; for it may
be thus rendered - "The head of my besieger, let the trouble of his lips
cover it": for cursing, let him be covered with cursing as with a cloak.
- John Mayer.

[Psa 140:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#009.md)

"Those that compass me about." For an explanation of this expression we
would refer the reader to "The Treasury of David," vol. 1, where he will
find two very pertinent extracts from J. Stevenson and Dr. Shaw.

[Psa 140:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#009.md)

"The mischief of their own lips." The pride and hauteur of the Jews in
our Lord's day brought the Roman arms upon them, and caused them to fall
into irremediable ruin. They evoked their own fate by exposing
themselves to an invasion from Rome at all; but they did it still more
in that terrific cry - "His blood be upon us and on our children." -
William Hill Tucker, in "The Psalms, with Notes, shewing their Prophetic
and Christian Character," 1840.

[Psa 140:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#009.md), [Psa
140:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#010.md)

Such passages admit of translation in the future, and are rather
predictions than imprecations. - Ingram Cobbin, 1839.

[Psa 140:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#009.md)

The prophet, in these three verses, predicted those just judgments which
heaven will inflict on the slanderers and persecutors of the righteous.
Their lips, which uttered mischief against others, shall be the means of
covering themselves with confusion, when out of their own mouths they
shall be judged. Those tongues which have contributed to set the world
on fire, shall be tormented with the hot burning coals of eternal
vengeance: and they, who, with so much eagerness and diligence have
prepared pits for the destruction of their brethren, shall be cast into
a deep and bottomless pit, out of which they will not rise up again any
more for ever. Evil speakers and false accusers shall gain no lasting
establishment, but punishment shall hunt sin through all its doubles,
and seize it at last as its legal prey. Let these great truths be firmly
rooted in our hearts, and they will keep us steady in the worst of
times. - George Horne.

[Psa 140:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#010.md)

"Let burning coals fall upon them," etc. The Psalmist seems here to
allude to the destruction of the Sodomites. In these imprecations he
considered his enemies as the enemies of God, rather than as his own;
and he thus cursed them, as knowing, in the quality of a prophet, that
God himself had cursed them: and therefore these sorts of imprecations
do not authorize other persons to curse their enemies. - Thomas Fenton.

[Psa 140:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#010.md)

"Let burning coals fall upon them," etc. An imprecation which (with the
similar previous one, [Psa 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#006), etc..md),
is a prophecy; and one which, while it has had no fulfilment in the case
of David's enemies, or any persecutors of the church in times past,
brings again vividly before the mind the fiery judgment of the Lord's
coming, and the awful sentence already pronounced against "the beast and
false prophet," the leaders of the confederation of the kings of the
earth and their armies, then "gathered together to make war against him"
- "these were cast alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone";
[Rev 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#019.md), [Rev
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020.md). So before, [Psa
55:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#015.md); [Psa
63:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#009.md). - William De Burgh.

[Psa 140:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#011.md)

"Let not an evil speaker \[a man full of tongue\] be established," etc.
The man given to talk, the liar, the flatterer, the detractor, the
scold, the brawler, "shall not be established in the earth," for such
people are abhorred by the wicked as well as by the good. - Robert
Bellarmine.

[Psa 140:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#011.md)

"Let not an evil speaker be established," etc. The positions laid down
in this verse will find abundant illustration in every age of the
church. "An evil speaker," who takes delight in wounding the reputation
of others, is seldom established or prospered in the earth. Providence
fights against such an unhappy wretch. "The violent man," the.
Ishmaelite whose hand is against every man, is in general overthrown by
the very same weapons which he wields against others. - John Morison.

[Psa 140:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#011.md)

"An evil speaker." By "a man of the tongue," as the original has It, the
Hebrews express a detractor or sycophant; one who gives his tongue the
liberty to vent what mischief he pleases. The Chaldee here expresses it
by a delator or vile informer with a threefold or three-forked tongue;
because such a man wounds three at once; the receiver, the sufferer, and
himself. - Thomas Fenton.

[Psa 140:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#011.md)

"Evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him." 'Tis an allusion to
hounds that are of a quick scent, and pursue the game with pleasure;
they do not see the deer or the hare, yet they follow upon the scent;
and though they have sometimes a very cold and dead scent, yet they will
follow and work it out. Thus "evil shall hunt the violent man to
overthrow him"; and though sometimes he hath, as it were, got out of the
view or sight of evil, and thinks himself under covert, yet these evils,
like a company of greedy hounds, will pursue till they have overtaken
and overthrown him. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 140:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#012.md)

"I know." For I have a promise of it, and that's infallible. - John
Trapp.

[Psa 140:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#012.md), [Psa
140:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#013.md)

"I know that the Lord will maintain the cause," etc. Why, how comes the
Psalmist so confident? "Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy
name": as if he had said, Thou hast a name for a gracious and faithful
God in thy promise, and this thou wilt never suffer to be blotted by
failing in thy word. Christian, thou mayest venture all thou art worth
on the public faith of Heaven: "His words are pure, as silver tried
seven times in a furnace." He that will not suffer a liar or
covenant-breaker to set foot on his holy hill, will much less suffer any
one thought of falseness or unfaithfulness to enter into his own most
holy heart. - William Gurnall.

[Psa 140:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#013.md)

"Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name," etc. Teacheth us
two things, first, that it becometh the godly to show themselves
continually thankful, because God is continually merciful to them;
secondly, what is the excellent estate and condition of God's children,
which, though it do not yet appear, yet shall it in the end break forth
with fulness of glory." - Thomas Wilcocks.

[Psa 140:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#013.md)

"The upright shall dwell in thy presence." "Sit in thy presence," as thy
friends or guests or favoured servants. Perhaps it may mean sit
(enthroned) before thee. Compare [Mat
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028.md). Some understand the sense to be
shall dwell (in the land) before thee, i.e., under thy protection and
inspection. - Joseph Addison Alexander.

[Psalms 140:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 140:1</span></span>

1 Deliver me, O Lord, from the evil man; preserve me from the violent
man;

2 Which imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually are they gathered
together for war.

3 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders' poison is
under their lips. Selah.

[Psa 140:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#001.md)

"Deliver me, O Lord, from the evil man." It reads like a clause of the
Lord's prayer, "Deliver us from evil." David does not so much plead
against an individual as against the species represented by him, namely,
the being whose best description is - "the evil man." There are many
such abroad; indeed we shall not find an unregenerate man who is not in
some sense an evil man, and yet all are not alike evil. It is well for
us that our enemies are evil, it would be a horrible thing to have the
good against us. When "the evil man" bestirs himself against the godly
he is as terrible a being as a wolf, or a serpent, or even a devil.
Fierce, implacable, unpitying, unrelenting, unscrupulous, he cares for
nothing but the indulgence of his malice. The persecuted man turns to
God in prayer; he could not do a wiser thing. Who can meet the evil man
and defeat him save Jehovah himself, whose infinite goodness is more
than a match for all the evil in the universe? We cannot of ourselves
baffle the craft of the enemy, but the Lord knoweth how to deliver his
saints. He can keep us out of the enemy's reach, he can sustain us when
under his power, he can rescue us when our doom seems fixed, he can give
us the victory when defeat seems certain; and in any and every case, if
he do not save us from the man he can keep us from the evil. Should we
be at this moment oppressed in any measure by ungodly men, it will be
better to leave our defence with God than to attempt it ourselves.

"Preserve me from the violent man." Evil in the heart simmers in malice,
and at last boils in passion. Evil is a raging thing when it getteth
liberty to manifest itself; and so "the evil man" soon develops into
"the violent man." What watchfulness, strength, or valour can preserve
the child of God from deceit and violence? There is but one sure
Preserver, and it is our wisdom to hide under the shadow of his wings.
It is a common thing for good men to be assailed by enemies - David was
attacked by Saul, Doeg, Ahithophel, Shimei, and others; even Mordecai
sitting humbly in the gate had his Haman; and our Lord, the Perfect One,
was surrounded by those who thirsted for his blood. We may not,
therefore, hope to pass through the world without enemies, but we may
hope to be delivered out of their hands, and preserved from their rage,
so that no real harm shall come of their malignity. This blessing is to
be sought by prayer, and expected by faith.

[Psa 140:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#002.md)

"Which imagine mischiefs in their heart." They cannot be happy unless
they are plotting and planning, conspiring and contriving. They seem to
have but one heart, for they are completely agreed in their malice; and
with all their heart and soul they pursue their victim. One piece of
mischief is not enough for them; they work in the plural, and prepare
many arrows for their bow. What they cannot actually do they
nevertheless like to think over, and to rehearse on the stage of their
cruel fancy. It is an awful thing to have such a heart-disease as this.
When the imagination gloats over doing harm to others, it is a sure sign
that the entire nature is far gone in wickedness. "Continually are they
gathered together for war." They are a committee of opposition in
permanent session they never adjourn, but perpetually consider the
all-absorbing question of how to do the most harm to the man of God.
They are a standing army always ready for the fray-they not only go to
the wars, but dwell in them. Though they are the worst of company, yet
they put up with one another, and are continually in each other's
society, confederate for fight. David's enemies were as violent as they
were evil, as crafty as they were violent, and as persistent as they
were crafty. It is hard dealing with persons who are only in their
element when they are at daggers-drawn with you. Such a case calls for
prayer, and prayer calls on God.

[Psa 140:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#003.md)

"They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent." The rapid motion of
a viper's tongue gives you the idea of its sharpening it; even thus do
the malicious move their tongues at such a rate that one might suppose
them to be in the very act of wearing them to a point, or rubbing them
to a keen edge. It was a common notion that serpents inserted their
poison by their tongues, and the poets used the idea as a poetical
expression, although it is certain that the serpent wounds by his fangs
and not by his tongue. We are not to suppose that all authors who used
such language were mistaken in their natural history any more than a
writer can be charged with ignorance of astronomy because he speaks of
the sun's travelling from east to west. How else can poets speak but
according to the appearance of things to an imaginative eye. The world's
great poet puts it in "King Lear".

"She struck me with her tongue,

Most serpent-like, upon the very heart."

In the case of slanderers, they so literally sting with their tongues,
which are so nimble in malice, and withal so piercing and cutting, that
it is by no means unjust to speak of them as sharpened. "Adders' poison
is under their lips." The deadliest of all venom is the slander of the
unscrupulous. Some men care not what they say so long as they can vex
and injure. Our text, however, must not be confined In its reference to
some few individuals, for in the inspired epistle to the Romans it is
quoted by the apostle as being true of us all. So depraved are we by
nature that the most venomous creatures are our fit types. The old
serpent has not only Inoculated us with his venom, but he has caused us
to be ourselves producers of the like poison, it lies under our lips,
ready for use, and, alas, it is all too freely used when we grow angry,
and desire to take vengeance upon any who have caused us vexation. It is
sadly wonderful what hard things even good men will say when provoked;
yea, even such as call themselves "perfect" in cool blood are not quite
as gentle as doves when their claims to sinlessness are bluntly
questioned. This poison of evil-speaking would never fall from our lips,
however much we might be provoked, if it were not there at other times;
but by nature we have as great a store of venomous words as a cobra has
of poison. O Lord, take the poison-bags away, and cause our lips to drop
nothing but honey. "Selah." This is heavy work. Go up, go up, my heart!
Sink not too low. Fall not into the lowest key. Lift up thyself to God.

[Psa 140:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#004.md)

4 Keep me, O Lord, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the
violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings.

5 The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net
by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah.

[Psa 140:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#004.md)

"Keep me, O Lord, from the hands of the wicked." To fall into their
hands would be a calamity indeed. David in his most pitiable plight
chose to fall into the hand of a chastising God rather than to be left
in the power of men. No creature among the wild beasts of the wood is so
terrible an enemy to man as man himself when guided by evil, and
impelled by violence. The Lord by providence and grace can keep us out
of the power of the wicked. He alone can do this, for neither our own
watchfulness nor the faithfulness of friends can secure us against the
serpentine assaults of the foe. We have need to be preserved from the
smooth as well as the rough hands of the ungodly, for their flatteries
may harm us as much as their calumnies. The hands of their example may
pollute us, and so do us more harm than the hands of their oppression.
Jehovah must be our keeper, or evil hands will do what evil hearts have
imagined and evil lips have threatened. "Preserve me from the violent
man." His intense passion makes him terribly dangerous. He will strike
anyhow, use any weapon, smite from any quarter: he is so furious that he
is reckless of his own life if he may accomplish his detestable design.
Lord, preserve us by thine omnipotence when men attack us with their
violence. This prayer is a wise and suitable one. "Who have purposed to
overthrow my goings." They resolve to turn the good man from his
resolve, they would defeat his designs, injure his integrity, and blast
his character. Their own goings are wicked, and therefore they hate
those of the righteous, seeing they are a standing rebuke to them. This
is a forcible argument to use in prayer with God: he is the patron of
holiness, and when the pure lives of his people are in danger of
overthrow, he may be expected to interpose. Never let the pious forget
to pray, for this is a weapon against which the most determined enemy
cannot stand.

[Psa 140:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#005.md)

"The proud have hid a snare for me." Proud as they are, they stoop to
this mean action, they use a snare, and they hide it away, that their
victim may be taken like a poor hare who is killed without warning -
killed in its usual run, by a snare which it could not see. David's
enemies wished to snare him in his path of service, the usual way of his
life. Saul laid many snares for David, but the Lord preserved him. All
around us there are snares of one sort or another, and he will be well
kept, ay, divinely kept, who never falls into one of them. "And cords."
With these they pull the net together and with these they bind their
captive. Thus fowlers do, and trappers of certain large animals. The
cords of love are pleasant, but the cords of hate are cruel as death
itself. "They have spread a net by the wayside." Where it will be near
their prey; where the slightest divergence from the path will bring the
victim into it. Surely the common wayside ought to be safe: men who go
out of the way may well be taken in a net, but the path of duty is
proverbially the path of safety; yet it is safe nowhere when malicious
persons are abroad. Birds are taken in nets, and men are taken by
deceit. Satan instructs his children in the art of fowling, and they
right speedily learn how to spread nets: perhaps they have been doing
that for us already; let us make our appeal to God concerning it. "They
have set gins for me." One instrument of destruction is not enough; they
are so afraid of missing their prey that they multiply their traps,
using differing devices, so that one way or another they may take their
victim. Those who avoid the snare and the net may yet be caught in a
gin, and accordingly gins are placed in all likely places. If a godly
man can be cajoled, or bribed, or cowed, or made angry, the wicked will
make the attempt. Ready are they to twist his words, misread his
intentions, and misdirect his efforts; ready to fawn, and lie, and make
themselves mean to the last degree so that they may accomplish their
abominable purpose. "Selah." The harp needs tuning after such a strain,
and the heart needs lifting up towards God.

[Psalms 140:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 140:6</span></span>

6 I said unto the Lord, Thou art my God, hear the voice of my
supplications, O Lord.

7 O God the Lord, the strength of my salvation thou hast covered my head
in the day of battle.

8 Grant not, O Lord, the desires of the wicked, further not his wicked
device; lest they exalt themselves. Selah.

[Psa 140:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#006.md)

"I said unto the Lord, thou art my God." Here was David's stay and hope.
He was assured that Jehovah was his God, he expressed that assurance,
and he expressed it before Jehovah himself. That had need be a good and
full assurance which a man dares to lay before the face of the
heart-searching Lord. The Psalmist when hunted by man, addressed himself
to God. Often the less we say to our foes, and the more we say to our
best Friend the better it will fare with us' if we say anything, let it
be said unto the Lord. David rejoiced in the fact that he had already
said that Jehovah was his God: he was content to have committed himself,
he had no wish to draw back. The Lord was David's own by deliberate
choice, to which he again sets his seal with delight. The wicked reject
God, but the righteous receive him as their own, their treasure, their
pleasure, their light and delight. "Hear the voice of my supplications,
O Lord." Since thou art mine, I pray thee hear my cries. We cannot ask
this favour of another man's god, but we may seek it from our own God.
The prayers of saints have a voice in them; they are expressive
pleadings even when they sound like inarticulate moanings. The Lord can
discern a voice in our wailings, and he can and will hearken thereto.
Because he is God he can hear us; because he is our God he will hear us.
So long as the Lord doth but hear us we are content - the answer may be
according to his own will, but we do entreat to be heard a soul in
distress is grateful to any one who will be kind and patient enough to
hearken to its tale, but specially is it thankful for an audience with
Jehovah. The more we consider his greatness and our insignificance, his
wisdom and our folly, the more shall we be filled with praise when the
Lord attends unto our cry.

[Psa 140:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#007.md)

"O God the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head
in the day of battle." When he looked back upon past dangers and
deliverances, the good man felt that he should have perished had not the
Lord held a shield over his head. In the day of the clash of arms, or of
putting on of armour (as some read it), the glorious Lord had been his
constant protector. Goliath had his armour-bearer, and so had Saul, and
these each one guarded his master; yet the giant and the king both
perished, while David, without armour or shield, slew the giant and
baffled the tyrant. The shield of the Eternal is better protection than
a helmet of brass. When arrows fly thick and the battle-axe crashes
right and left, there is no covering for the head like the power of the
Almighty. See how the Child of providence glorifies his Preserver! He
calls him not only his salvation, but the strength of it, by whose
unrivalled force he had been enabled to outlive the cunning and cruelty
of his adversaries. He had obtained a deliverance in which the strength
of the Omnipotent was clearly to be seen. This is a grand utterance of
praise, a gracious ground of comfort, a prevalent argument in prayer. He
that has covered our head aforetime will not now desert us. Wherefore
let us fight a good fight, and fear no deadly wound: the Lord God is our
shield, and our exceeding great reward.

[Psa 140:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#008.md)

"Grant not, O Lord, the desires of the wicked." Even they are dependent
upon thee; they can do no more than thou dost permit. Thou dost restrain
them; not a dog of them can move his tongue without thy leave and
license. Therefore I entreat thee not to let them have their way. Even
though they dare to pray to thee, do not hear their prayers against
innocent men. Assuredly the Lord Jehovah will be no accomplice with the
malevolent; their desires shall never be his desires; if they thirst for
blood he will not gratify their cruelty. "Further not his wicked
device." They are so united as to be like one man in their wishes; but
do not hear their prayers. Though hand join in hand, and they desire and
design as one man, yet do not thou lend them the aid of thy providence.
Do not permit their malicious schemes to succeed. The Lord may allow
success to attend the policy of the wicked for a time for wise reasons
unknown to us, but we are permitted to pray that it be not so. The
petition "Deliver us from evil" includes and allows such supplication.
"Lest they exalt themselves." If successful, the wicked are sure to grow
proud, and insult the righteous over whom they have triumphed, and this
is so great an evil, and so dishonouring to God, that the Psalmist uses
it in his pleading as an argument against their being allowed to
prosper. The glory of the wicked is opposed to the glory of God. If God
seems to favour them they grow too high for this world, and their heads
strike against the heavens. Let us hope that the Lord will not suffer
this to be. "Selah." Here let us exalt our thoughts and praises high
over the heads of self-exalting sinners. The more they rise in conceit
the higher let us rise in confidence.

[Psalms 140:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 140:9</span></span>

9 As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of
their own lips cover them.

10 Let burning coals fall upon them; let them be cast into the fire;
into deep pits, that they rise not up again.

11 Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth, evil shall hunt
the violent man to overthrow him.

[Psa 140:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#009.md)

"As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of
their own lips cover them." To the Lord who had covered his head amid
the din of arms the Psalmist appeals against his foes, that their heads
may be covered in quite another sense - covered with the reward of their
own malice. David's foes were so many that they hemmed him in,
encircling him as hunters do their prey. It is little wonder that he
turns to the Lord in his dire need. The poet represents his adversaries
as so united as to have but one head; for there is often a unanimity
among evil spirits which makes them the more strong and terrible for
their vile purposes. The lex talionis, or law of retaliation, often
brings down upon violent men the evil which they planned and spoke of
for others: their arrows fall upon themselves. When a man's lips vent
curses they will probably, like chickens, come home to roost. A stone
hurled upward into the air is apt to fall upon the thrower's head.

David's words may be read in the future as a prophecy; but in this
verse, at any rate, there is no need to do so in order to soften their
tone. It is so just that the mischief which men plot and the slander
which they speak should recoil upon themselves that every righteous man
must desire it: he who does not desire it may wish to be considered
humane and Christlike, but the chances are that he has a sneaking
agreement with the wicked, or is deficient in a manly sense of right and
wrong. When evil men fall into pits which they have digged for the
innocent we believe that even the angels are glad; certainly the most
gentle and tender of philanthropists, however much they pity the
sufferers, must also approve the justice which makes them suffer. We
suspect that some of our excessively soft-spoken critics only need to be
put into David's place, and they would become a vast deal more bitter
than he ever was.

[Psa 140:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#010.md)

"Let burning coals fall upon them." Then will they know that the
scattering of the firebrands is not the sport they thought it to be.
When hailstones and coals of fire descend upon them, how will they
escape? Even the skies above the wicked are able to deal out vengeance
upon them. "Let them be cast into the fire." They have kindled the
flames of strife, and it is fair that they should be cast therein. They
have heated the furnace of slander seven times hotter than it was wont
to be heated, and they shall be devoured therein. Who would have pitied
Nebuchadnezzar if he had been thrown into his own burning fiery furnace?
"Into deep pits, that they rise not up again." They made those ditches
or fosses for the godly, and it is meet that they should themselves fall
into them and never escape. When a righteous man falls he rises again;
but when the wicked man goes down "he falls like Lucifer, never to hope
again." The Psalmist in this passage graphically depicts the Sodom of
the wicked persecutor: fire falls upon him from heaven; the city blazes,
and he is east into the conflagration; the vale of Siddim is full of
slime-pits, and into these he is buried. Extraordinary judgment
overtakes the extraordinary offender: above, around, beneath, all is
destruction. He would have consumed the righteous, and now he is
consumed himself. So shall it be: so let it be.

[Psa 140:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#011.md)

"Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth." For that would be
an established plague, a perpetual curse. Men of false and cruel tongues
are of most use when they go to fatten the soil in which they rot as
carcasses: while they are alive they are the terror of the good, and the
torment of the poor. God will not allow the specious orators of
falsehood to retain the power they temporarily obtain by their deceitful
speaking. They may become prominent, but they cannot become permanent.
They shall be disendowed and disestablished in spite of all that they
can say to the contrary. All evil bears the element of decay within
itself; for what is it but corruption? Hence the utmost powers of
oratory are insufficient to settle upon a sure foundation the cause
which bears a lie within it. "Evil shall hunt the violent man to
overthrow him." He hunted the good, and now his own evil shall hunt him.
He tried to overthrow the goings of the righteous, and now his own
unrighteousness shall prove his overthrow. As he was violent, so shall
he be violently assaulted and hunted down. Sin is its own punishment; a
violent man will need no direr doom than to reap what he has sown. It is
horrible for a huntsman to be devoured by his own hounds; yet this is
the sure fate of the persecutor.

[Psalms 140:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 140:12</span></span>

12 I know that the Lord will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and
the right of the poor.

13 Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name - the upright
shall dwell in thy presence.

[Psa 140:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#012.md)

"I know that the Lord will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and the
right of the poor." All through the Psalm the writer is bravely
confident, and speaks of things about which he had no doubt: in fact, no
Psalm can be more grandly positive than this protest against slander.
The slandered saint knew Jehovah's care for the afflicted, for he had
received actual proofs of it himself. "I will maintain it" is the motto
of the great Defender of the rights of the needy. What confidence this
should create within the bosoms of the persecuted and poverty-stricken!
The prosperous and wealthy can maintain their own cause, but those who
are otherwise shall find that God helps those who cannot help
themselves. Many talk as if the poor had no rights worth noticing, but
they will sooner or later find out their mistake when the judge of all
the earth begins to plead with them.

[Psa 140:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#013.md)

"Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name." The former Psalm
had its "surely," but this is a more pleasing one. As surely as God will
slay the wicked he will save the oppressed, and fill their hearts and
mouths with praises. Whoever else may be silent, the righteous will give
thanks; and whatever they may suffer, the matter will end in their
living through the trial, and magnifying the Lord for his delivering
grace. On earth ere long, and in heaven for ever, the pure heart shall
sing unto the Lord. How loud and sweet will be the songs of the redeemed
in the millennial age, when the meek shall inherit the earth, and
delight themselves in the abundance of peace!

"The upright shall dwell in thy presence." Thus shall they give thanks
in the truest and fullest manner. This abiding before the Lord shall
render to him "songs without words," and therefore all the more
spiritual and true. Their living and walking with their God shall be
their practical form of gratitude. Sitting down in holy peace, like
children at their father's table, their joyful looks and language shall
speak their high esteem and fervent love to him who has become their
dwelling-place. How high have we climbed in this Psalm - from being
hunted by the evil man to dwelling in the divine presence; so doth faith
upraise the saint from the lowest depths to heights of peaceful repose.
Well might the song be studded with Selahs, or uplifters.
