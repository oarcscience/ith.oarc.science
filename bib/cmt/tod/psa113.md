### [Psalms Chapter 113](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 113:0</span></span>

Title and Subject. - This Psalm is one of pure praise, and contain but
little which requires exposition; a warm heart full of admiring
adoration of the Most High will best of all comprehend this sacred hymn.
Its subject is the greatness and condescending goodness of the God of
Israel, as exhibited in lifting up the needy from their low estate. It
may fitly be sung by the church during a period of revival after it has
long been minished and brought low. With this Psalm begins the Hallel,
or Hallelujah of the Jews, which was sung at their solemn feasts: we
will therefore call it the commencement of the Hallel. Dr. Edersheim
tells us that the Talmud dwells upon the peculiar suitableness of the
Hallel to the Passover, "since it not only recorded the goodness of God
towards Israel, but especially their deliverance from Egypt, and
therefore appropriately opened with 'Praise ye Jehovah, ye servants of
Jehovah,' - and no longer servants\_of Phar\_oh." It\_ allusi\_ns to the
poor in the dust and the needy upon the dunghill are all in keeping with
Israel in Egypt, and so also is the reference to the birth of numerous
children where they were least expected.

Division. - No division need be made in the exposition of this Psalm,
except it be that which is suggested by the always instructive headings
supplied by the excellent authors of our common version: an exhortation
to praise God, for his excellency, [Psa
113:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001.md); for his mercy, [Psa
113:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#006.md).

Hints to Preachers

Whole Psalm. - The Psalm contains three parts: -

I. An exhortation to God's servants to praise him.

II\. A form set down how and where to praise him, [Psa 113:2, 19
113:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#002.md).

III\. The reasons to persuade us to it.

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Whole Psalm

With this Psalm begins the Hallel, which is recited at the three great
feasts, at the feast of the Dedication (Chanucca) and at the new moons,
and not on New Year's day and the day of Atonement, because a cheerful
song of praise does not harmonise with the mournful solemnity of these
days. And they are recited only in fragments during the last days of the
Passover, for "my creatures, saith the Holy One, blessed be He, were
drowned in the sea, and ought ye to break out into songs of rejoicing?"
In the family celebration of the Passover night it is divided into two
parts, the one half, [Psa 113:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001.md),
[Psa 114:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#001.md), being sung before the
repast, before the emptying of the second festal cup, and the other
half, Ps. 115-118, after the repast, after the filling of the fourth
cup, to which the ὑμνὴσαντες ([Mat
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#030.md), [Mar
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#026).md), or singing a hymn, after the
institution of the Lord's Supper, which was connected with the fourth
festal cup, may refer. Paulus Burgensis styles Ps. 113 - 118. Alleluja
Judaeorum magnum. (The great Alleluiah of the Jews). This designation is
also frequently found elsewhere. But according to the prevailing custom,
Ps. 113-118, and more particularly Ps. 115-118, are called only Hallel
and [Psa 131:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001.md), with its "for his
mercy endureth for ever" repeated twenty-six times, bears the name of
"The Great Hallel" (הלּל הבּדול). - Frank Delitzsch.

Whole Psalm

The Jews have handed down the tradition, that this Psalm, and those that
follow on to [Psa 118:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#001.md), were all sung
at the Passover; and they are denominated "The Great Hallel." This
tradition shows, at all events, that the ancient Jews perceived in these
six Psalms some link of close connection. They all sing of God the
Redeemer, in some aspect of his redeeming character; and this being so,
while they suited the paschal feast, we can see how appropriate they
would be in the lips of the Redeemer, in his Upper Room. Thus -

In [Psa 113:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001.md), he sang praise to him
who redeems from the lowest depth.

In [Psa 114:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#001.md), he sang praise to him
who once redeemed Israel, and shall redeem Israel again.

In Psalm 115, he uttered a song - over earth's fallen idols - to him who
blesses Israel and the world.

In Psalm 116, he sang his resurrection-song of thanksgiving by
anticipation.

In [Psa 117:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa117.htm#001.md), he led the song of
praise for the great congregation.

In Psalm 118 (just before leaving the Upper Room to go to Gethsemane),
he poured forth the story of his suffering, conflict, triumph and
glorification. - A. A. Bonar.

Whole Psalm

An attentive reader of the Book of Psalms will observe, that almost
every one of them has a view to Christianity. Many, if not most of the
Psalms, were without doubt occasioned originally by accidents of the
life that befell their royal author; they were therefore at the same
time both descriptive of the situation and life, the actions and
sufferings, of King David, and predictive also of our Saviour, who was
all along represented by King David, from whose loins he was descended
according to the flesh. But this Psalm appears to be wholly written with
a view to Christianity. It begins with an exhortation to all true
servants and zealous worshippers of God, to "praise his name," at all
times, and in all places; "from this time forth and for evermore," and
"from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof." And the ground
of this praise and adoration is set forth in the following verses to be,
- first, the glorious majesty of his Divine nature; and next, the
singular goodness of it as displayed to us in his works of providence,
particularly by exalt thy those who are abased, and his making the
barren to become fruitful. His lifting the poor out of the mire, and
making the barren woman to become fruitful, may, at first sight, seem an
odd mixture of ideas. But a right notion of the prophetic language will
solve the difficulty; and teach us, that both the expressions are in
fact very nearly related, and signify much the same thing. For by the
"poor'" are here meant those who are destitute of all heavenly knowledge
(the only true and real riches) and who are sunk in the mire and filth
of sin. So, again, his making "the barren woman to keep house, and to be
a joyful mother of children," is a prophetic metaphor, or allusion to
the fruitfulness of the Church in bringing forth sons or professors of
the true religion. My interpretation of both these expressions is
warrantable from so many parallel passages of Scripture. I shall only
observe that here the profession of the Christian faith throughout the
whole earth is foretold; as also the particular direction or point of
the compass, toward which Christianity should by the course of God's
providence be steered and directed, viz., from East to West, or "from
the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same." - James Bate,
1703-1775.

[Psa 113:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001.md)

"Praise ye the Lord." "Praise." The הללוּ is repeated. This repetition
is not without significance. It is for the purpose of waking us up out
of our torpor. We are all too dull and slow in considering and praising
the blessings of God. There is, therefore, necessity for these stimuli.
Then this repetition signifies assiduity and perseverance in sounding
forth the praises of God. It is not sufficient once and again to praise
God, but his praises ought to be always sung in the Church. - Mollerus.

[Psa 113:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001.md)

"Praise ye the Lord." This praising God rests not in the mere
speculation or idle contemplation of the Divine excellence, floating
only in the brain, or gliding upon the tongue, but in such quick and
lively apprehensions of them as to sink down into the heart, and there
beget affections suitable to them; for it will make us love him for his
goodness, respect him for his greatness, fear him for his justice, dread
him for his power, adore him for his wisdom, and for all his attributes
make us live in constant awe and obedience to him. This is to praise
God, without which all other courting and complimenting of him is but
mere flattery and hypocrisy.... God Almighty endowed us with higher and
nobler faculties than other creatures, for this end, that we should set
forth his praise; for though other things were made to administer the
matter and occasion, yet man alone was designed and qualified to
exercise the act of glorifying God.... In short, God Almighty hath so
closely twisted his own glory and our happiness together, that at the
same time we advance the one we promote the other. - Matthew Hole, 1730.

[Psa 113:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001.md)

"Praise, O ye servants of the Lord." From the exhortation to praise God,
and the declaration of his deserving to be praised; learn, that as it is
all men's duty to praise the Lord, so in special it is the duty of his
ministers, and officers of his house. First, because their office doth
call for the discharge of it publicly. Next, because as they should be
best acquainted with the reasons of his praise, so also should they be
the fittest instruments to declare it. And lastly, because the ungodly
are deaf unto the exhortation, and dumb in the obedience of it;
therefore when he hath said, "Praise ye the Lord," he sub-joineth,
"Praise, O ye servants of the Lord." - David Dickson.

[Psa 113:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001.md)

"Ye servants of the Lord." - All men owe this duty to God, as being the
workmanship of his hands; Christians above other men, as being the sheep
of his pasture; preachers of the word above other Christians, as being
pastors of his sheep, and so consequently patterns in word, in
conversation, in love, in spirit, in faith, in pureness. [Ti1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#012.md). - John Boys.

[Psa 113:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001.md),

Hallelujah, praise the Lord

Praise, ye servants, praise his name!

Be Jehovah's praise ador'd,

Now and evermore the same!

Where the orient sun-beams gleam,

Where they sink in ocean's stream,

Through the circuit of his rays

Be your theme Jehovah's praise.

Richard Mant.

[Psa 113:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#002.md)

"Blessed be the name of the Lord." Let then, O man, thy labouring soul
strive to conceive (for 'tis impossible to express) what an immense debt
of gratitude thou owest to him, who, by his creating goodness called
thee out of nothing to make thee a partaker of reason, and even a sharer
of immortality with himself; who, by his preserving goodness, designs to
conduct thee safe through the various stages of thy eternal existence;
and who, by his redeeming goodness, hath prepared for thee a happiness
too big for the comprehension of a human understanding. Canst thou
receive such endearments of love to thee and all mankind with
insensibility and coldness?... In the whole compass of language what
word is expressive enough to paint the black ingratitude of that man,
who is unaffected by, and entirely regardless of, the goodness of God
his Creator, and the mercies of Christ? - Jeremiah Seed, 1747.

[Psa 113:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#002.md)

"Blessed be the name of the Lord," etc. No doubt the disciples that sat
at that paschal table, would repeat with mingled feelings of
thanksgiving and sadness that ascription of praise. "Blessed be the name
of the Load from this time forth and for evermore." But what Israelite,
in all the paschal chambers at Jerusalem on that night, as he sang the
Hallel or hymn, or which of the disciples at the sorrowing board of
Jesus, could have understood or entered into the full meaning of the
expression, "from this time forth?" From what time? I think St. John
gives us a clue to the very hour and moment of which the Psalmist,
perhaps unconsciously, spake. He tells us, that when the traitor Judas
had received the sop, he immediately went out; and that when he was gone
out to clench as it were and ratify his treacherous purpose, Jesus said,
"Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in Him." From
that time forth, when by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of
God, the Son of man was about to be delivered into the hands of wicked
men, and crucified and slain, as Jesus looked at those around him, as
sorrow had indeed filled their hearts, and as with all-seeing, prescient
eye he looked onwards and beheld all those that should hereafter believe
on him through their word, with what significance and emphasis of
meaning may we imagine the blessed Jesus on that night of anguish to
have uttered these words of the hymn, "Blessed be the name of the Lord
from this time forth and for evermore"! "A few more hours and the
covenant will be sealed in my own blood; the compact ratified, when I
hang upon the cross." And with what calm and confident assurance of
triumph does he look upon that cross of shame; with what overflowing
love does he point to it and say, "And I, If I be lifted up, will draw
all men unto me"! It is the very same here in this Paschal Psalm; and
how must the Saviour's heart have rejoiced even in the contemplation of
those sufferings that awaited him, as he uttered this prediction, "From
the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the Lord's name is
to be praised"! "That which thou sowest is not quickened except it die:"
"and thus from that hour to the present the Lord hath added daily to the
church those whom in every age and in every clime he hath chosen unto
salvation, till, in his own appointed fulness of time, from the east and
from the west, from the north and from the south, all nations shall do
him service, and the earth be filled with the knowledge of the Lord as
the water cover the sea." - Barton Bouchier.

[Psa 113:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#002.md)

"From this time forth and for evermore." The servants of the Lord are to
sing his praises in this life to the world's end; and in the next life,
world without end. - John Boys.

[Psa 113:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#003.md)

"From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same." That is
everywhere, from east to west. These western parts of the world are
particularly prophesied of to enjoy the worship of God after the Jews
which were in the east; and these islands of ours that lie in the sea,
into which the sun is said to go down, which is an expression of the old
Greek poets; and the prophet here useth such a word in the Hebrew, where
the west is called, according to the vulgar conceit, the sunset, or the
sun's going down, or going in. - Samuel Torshell, 1641.

[Psa 113:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#004.md), [Psa
113:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#005.md)

"The Lord is high."..."The lord our God dwelleth on high." But how high
is he? Answer

I. So high, that all creatures bow before him and do homage to him
according to their several aptitudes and abilities. John brings them all
in, attributing to him the crown of glory, putting it from themselves,
but setting it upon his head, as a royalty due only to him. ([Rev
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#013).md).

1\. Some by way of subjection, stooping to him: angels and saints
worship him, acknowledging his highness, by denying their own, but
setting up his will as their supreme law and excellency.

2\. Others acknowledge his eminency by their consternation upon the
least shining forth of his glory; when he discovers but the emblems of
his greatness, devils tremble, men quake, [Jam
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#019.md); [Isa
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#014.md). Thirdly, even inanimate
creatures, by compliance with, and ready subjection to, the impressions
of his power, [Hab 3:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#009.md); [Isa
48:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#013.md); [Dan
4:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#035.md)....

II\. He is so high that he surmounts all created capacity to comprehend
him, [Job 11:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#007.md). So that indeed, in
David's phrase, his greatness is "unsearchable," [Psa
145:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#003.md). In a word, he is so high,

1\. That no bodily eye hath ever, or can possibly see him.

2\. Neither can the eye of the understanding perfectly reach him. He
dwells in inaccessible light that no mortal eye can attain to. -
Condensed from a sermon by Thomas Hodges, entitled, "A Glimpse of God's
Glory," 1642.

[Psa 113:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#005.md)

"Who is like unto the Lord our God?" It is the nature of love, that the
one whom we love we prefer to all others, and we ask, Who is like my
beloved? The world has not his like. Thus love thinks ever of one, who
in many things is inferior to many others; for in human affairs the
judgment of love is blind. But those who love the Lord their God, though
they should glow with more ardent love for him, and should ask, Who is
as the Lord our God? in this matter would not be mistaken, but would
think altogether most correctly. For there is no being, either in heaven
or in earth, who can be in any way likened unto the Lord God. Even love
itself cannot conceive, think, speak concerning God whom we love as he
really is. - Wolfgang Musculus.

[Psa 113:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#005.md)

"Who is like unto the Lord our God," etc. Among the gods of the nations
as Kimchi; or among the angels of heaven, or among any of the mighty
monarchs on earth; there is none like him for the perfections of his
nature, for his wisdom, power, truth, and faithfulness; for his
holiness, justice, goodness, grace, and mercy. Who is eternal,
unchangeable, omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent? Nor for the works
of his hands, his works of creation, providence, and grace; none ever
did the like. What makes this reflection the more delightful to truly
good men is, that this God is their God; and all this is true of our
Immanuel, God with us, who is God over all, and the only Saviour and
Redeemer; and there is none in heaven and earth like him, or to be
desired beside him. - John Gill.

[Psa 113:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#005.md)

"The Lord our God who dwelleth on high." God is on high in respect of
place or dwelling. It is true he is in the arial and starry heaven by
his essence and power; but the heaven of the blessed is his throne: not
as if he were so confined to that place as to be excluded from others,
for "the heaven of heavens cannot contain him"; but in respect of
manifestation he is said to be there, because in that place he chiefly
manifests his glory and goodness. In respect of his essence he is high
indeed, inexpressibly high in excellency above all beings, not only in
Abraham's phrase, "The High God," but in David's, "The Lord most High."
Alas! what are all created beings in respect of him, with all their
excellences, but nothing and vanity?... For these excellences are divers
things in the creatures, but one in God; they are accidents in the
creatures, but essence in God; they are in the creature with some alloy
or other, they are like the moon when they sine brightest, yet are spots
of imperfection to be found in them. In respect to measure, he is
infinitely above them all. Alas, they possess some small drops in
respect to the fountain, some poor glimmering rays in respect to this
glorious sun; in a word, he is an infinite ocean of perfection, without
either brink or bottom. - Thomas Hodges, in a Sermon preached before the
House of Commons, 1642.

[Psa 113:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#005.md)

God is said not only to be on high, but to "dwell" on high; this
intimates calm and composed operation, and it is proper for us to take
this view of the character of God's administration. You recollect that
in all ages unbelief has been in some respect rendered plausible by the
delays of God in the accomplishment of his designs. So, in St. Peter's
time, it would seem that because the apostles and preachers of
Christianity had dwelt much on Christ's coming to judgment, they cried
out, "Where is the promise of his coming, for since the fathers fell
asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the
creation?" What is the apostle's answer to this? His first answer, I
grant, is, that all things have not continued as they were from tile
creation, for there was a flood of waters, and those who said, Where is
the promise of his coming? in the days of Noah were at last answered by
the bursting earth and the breaking heavens.... That was his first
answer; but his second answer contains the principle that, "One day is
with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day." The
Being who is from everlasting to everlasting is under no necessity to
hurry his plans; therefore he hath fixed the times and the seasons -
they are all with him, and he dwelleth on high. - Richard Watson, 1831.

[Psa 113:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#005.md), [Psa
113:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#006.md)

The philosophy of the world, even in the present day, has its elevated
and magnificent views of the Divine Being; yet it would seem uniform,
whether among the sages of the heathen world or among the philosophers
of the present day, that the loftier their views are even of the Divine
nature, the more they tend to distrust and unbelief; and that, just in
proportion as they have thought nobly of God, so the impression has
deepened - that, with respect to individuals at least, they were not the
subjects of his immediate care. The doctrine of a particular providence,
and the doctrine of direct divine influence upon the heart of man, have
by them always been considered absurd and fanatical. Now, when I turn to
the sages of inspiration - to the holy men of old, who thought and spoke
as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, I find quite a different result -
that in proportion to the views they had of the glory of God, so was
their confidence and hope.

That two such opposite results should spring from the same order of
thoughts with respect to the Divine Being, is a singular fact, which
demands and deserves some enquiry. How is it that, among the men of the
world, wise as they are, in proportion as they have had high and exalted
views of God, those lofty ideas tend to distrust; while just in
proportion as we are enlightened on the very same subjects by the
Scriptures of truth, rightly and spiritually understood, that we as well
as the authors of these sacred books, in proportion as we see the glory
and the grandeur of God, are excited to a filial and comforting trust?
There are two propositions in the text which human reason could never
unite. "Who dwelleth on high" - but yet he "humbleth himself to behold
the things that are in heaven, and in the earth." And the reason why the
mere unassisted human faculties could never unite these two Ideas is,
that they could not, in the nature of things, be united, but by a third
discovery, which must have come from God himself, and show the two in
perfect harmony - the discovery that "God so loved the world that he
gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not
perish, but have everlasting life." - Richard Watson, 1831.

[Psa 113:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#005.md), [Psa
113:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#006.md)

The structure of this passage in the original is singular, and is thus
stated and commented on by Bp. Lowth, in his 19th Praelection: -

Who is like Jehovah our God?

Who dwelleth on high.

Who looketh below.

In heaven and in earth.

The latter member is to be divided, and assigned in its two divisions to
the two former members; so that the sense may be, "who dwelleth on high
in heaven, and looketh below on the things which are in earth." -
Richard Mant.

[Psa 113:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#006.md)

"Who humbleth himself." Whatever may be affirmed of God, may be affirmed
of him infinitely, and whatever he is, he is infinitely. So the
Psalmist, in this place, does not speak of God as humble, but as
infinitely and superlatively so, humble beyond all conception and
comparison; he challenges the whole universe of created nature, from the
highest immortal spirit in heaven to the lowest mortal on earth, to show
a being endued with so much humility, as the adorable majesty of the
great God of Heaven and earth.... If some instances of the Divine
humility surprise, the following may amaze us: - To see the great King
of heaven stooping from his height, and condescending himself to offer
terms of reconciliation to his rebellious creatures! To see offended
majesty courting the offenders to accept of pardon! To see God
persuading, entreating and beseeching men to return to him with such
earnestness and importunity, as if his very life were bound up in them,
and his own happiness depended upon theirs! To see the adorable Spirit
of God, with infinite long-suffering and gentleness, submitting to the
contempt and insults of such miserable, despicable wretches as sinful
mortals are! Is not this amazing? - Valentine Nalson, 1641-1724.

[Psa 113:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#006.md)

"Who humbleth himself to behold." - If it be such condescension for God
to behold things in heaven and earth, what an amazing condescension was
it for the Son of God to come from heaven to earth and take our nature
upon him, that he might seek and save them that were lost I Here indeed
he humbled himself - Matthew Henry.

[Psa 113:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#007.md)

"He raiseth up the poor," etc. There is no doubt a reference in this to
the respect which God pays even to the lower ranks of the race, seeing
that "he raiseth up the poor, and lifteth up the needy." I have no doubt
there is reference throughout the whole of this Psalm to evangelical
times; that, in this respect, it is a prophetic psalm, including a
reference especially to Christianity, as it may be called by eminence
and distinction the religion of the poor - its greatest glory. For when
John tile Baptist sent two disciples to Jesus, to know whether he was
the Messiah or not, the answer of our Lord was, "The blind see, the
lepers are cleansed, the dead are raised" - all extraordinary events -
miracles, in short, which proved his divine commission. And he summed up
the whole by saying, "The poor have the gospel preached unto them;" as
great a miracle as any - as great a distinction as any. There never was
a religion but the true religion, in all its various dispensations, that
had equal respect to all classes of society. In all others there was a
privileged class, but here there is none. Perhaps one of the most
interesting views of Christianity we can take is its wonderful
adaptation to the character and circumstances of the poor. What an
opportunity does it furnish for the manifestation of the bright and mild
graces of the Holy Spirit! What sources of comfort does it open to
mollify the troubles of life! and how often, in choosing the poor, rich
in faith to make them heirs of the kingdom, does God exalt the poor out
of the dust, and the needy from tile dunghill! - Richard Watson.

[Psa 113:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#007.md)

"He raiseth up the poor," etc. Gideon is fetched from threshing, Saul
from seeking the asses, and David from keeping the sheep; the apostles
from fishing are sent to be "fishers of men." The treasure of the gospel
is put into earthen vessels, and the weak and the foolish ones of the
world pitched upon to be preachers of it, to confound the "wise and
mighty" ([Co1 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#027.md), [Co1
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#028),.md) that the excellency of the
power may be of God, and all may see that promotion comes from him. -
Matthew Henry.

[Psa 113:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#007.md)

"He raiseth up the poor." The highest honour, which was ever done to any
mere creature, was done out of regard to the lowest humility; the Son of
God had such regard to the lowliness of the blessed virgin, that he did
her the honour to choose her for the mother of his holy humanity. It is
an observation of S. Chrysostom, that that very hand which the humble
John Baptist thought not worthy to unloose the shoe on our blessed
Saviour's feet, that hand our Lord thought worthy to baptize Iris sacred
head. - Valentine Nalson.

[Psa 113:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#007.md)

"And lifteth the needy out of the dunghill"; which denotes a mean
condition, so one born in a mean place, and brought up in a mean manner,
is sometimes represented as taken out of a dunghill; and also it is
expressive of a filthy one; men by sin are not only brought into a low
estate, but into a loathsome one, and are justly abominable in the sight
of God, and yet he lifts them out of it: the phrases of raising up and
lifting out suppose them to be fallen, as men are in Adam, fallen from a
state of honour and glory, in and out of which they cannot deliver
themselves; it is Christ's work, and his only, to raise up the tribes of
Jacob, and to help or lift up his servant Israel. [Isa
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#006.md); [Luk
1:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#054.md); see [Sa1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#008.md). - John Gill.

[Psa 113:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#007.md)

"The poor ... the needy." Rejoice, then, in the favourable notice God
taketh of you. The highest and greatest of beings vouchsafes to regard
you. Though you are poor and mean, and men overlook you: though your
brethren hate you, and your friends go far from you, yet hear! God
looketh down from his majestic throne upon you. Amidst the infinite
variety of his works, you are not overlooked. Amidst the nobler services
of ten thousand times ten thousand saints and angels, not one of your
fervent prayers or humble groans escapes his ear. - Job Orton,
1717-1783.

[Psa 113:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#007.md)

Almighty God cannot look above himself, as having no superiors; nor
about himself, as having no equals; he beholds such as are below him;
and therefore the lower a man is, the nearer unto God; he resists the
proud, and gives grace to the humble, [Pe1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005.md). He pulls down the mighty from
their seat, and exalteth them of low degree. The Most High hath special
eye to such as are most humble; for, as it followeth in our text, "he
taketh up the simple out of the dust, and lifteth the poor out of the
dirt." - John Boys.

[Psa 113:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#007.md)

"Dunghill." An emblem of the deepest poverty and desertion; for in Syria
and Palestine the man who is shut out from society lies upon the mezbele
(the dunghill or heap of ashes), by day calling upon the passers-by for
alms, and by night hiding himself in the ashes that have been warmed by
the sun. - Franz Delitzsch.

[Psa 113:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#007.md)

"Dunghill." The passages of the Bible, in which the word occurs, all
seem to refer, as Parkhurst remarks, to the stocks of cow-dung and other
offal stuff, which the easterns for want of wood were obliged to lay up
for fuel. - Richard Mant.

[Psa 113:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#007.md), [Psa
113:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#008.md)

These verses are taken almost word for word from the prayer of Hannah,
[Sa1 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#008.md). The transition to the
"people" is all the more natural, as Hannah, considering herself at the
conclusion as the type of the church, with which every individual among
the Israelites felt himself much more closely entwined than can easily
be the case among ourselves, draws out of the salvation imparted to
herself joyful prospects for the future. - E. W. Hengstenberg.

[Psa 113:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#008.md)

"Even with the princes of his people." It is the honour that cometh from
God that alone exalts. Whatever account the world may take of a poor
man, he may be more precious in the eyes. of God than the highest among
men. The humble poor are here ranked, not with the princes of the earth,
but with "the princes of his people." The distinctions in this world,
even among those who serve the same God, are as nothing in his sight
when contrasted with that honour which is grounded on the free grace of
God to his own. But here, also, the fulness of this statement will only
be seen in the world to come, when all the faithful will be owned as
kings and priests unto God. - W. Wilson.

[Psa 113:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#009.md)

"He maketh the barren woman to keep house," etc. Should a married woman,
who has long been considered sterile, become a mother, her joy, and that
of her husband and friends, will be most extravagant. "They called her
Malady," that is, "Barren," "but she has given us good fruit." "My
neighbours pointed at me, and said, Malady: but what will they say now?"
A man who on any occasion manifests great delight, is represented to be
like the barren woman who has at length borne a child. Anything which is
exceedingly valuable is thus described: "This is as precious as the son
of the barren woman"; that is, of her who had long been reputed barren.
- Joseph Roberts.

[Psa 113:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#009.md)

"He maketh the barren woman to keep house," etc. As baseness in men, so
barrenness in women is accounted a great unhappiness. But as God lifteth
up the beggar out of the mire, to set him with princes, even so doth he
"make the barren woman a joyful mother of children." He governs all
things in the private family, as well as in the public weal. Children
and the fruit of the womb are a gift and heritage that cometh of the
Lord, [Psa 127:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#003.md); and therefore the
Papists in praying to S. Anne for children, and the Gentiles in calling
upon Diana, Juno, Latona, are both in error, It is God only who makes
the barren women "a mother," and that "a joyful mother." Every mother is
joyful at the first, according to that of Christ, "a woman when she
travaileth hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is
delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy
that a man is born into the world."

Divines apply this also mystically to Christ, affirming that he made the
church of the Gentiles, heretofore "barren," "a joyful mother of
children," according to that of the prophet: "Rejoice, O barren, that
didst not bear; break forth into joy and rejoice, thou that didst not
travail with child: for the desolate hath more children than the married
wife, saith the Lord," [Isa 54:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001.md). Or
it may be construed of true Christians: all of us are by nature barren
of goodness, conceived and born in sin not able to think a good thought
([Co2 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#005).md); but the Father of lights
and mercies makes us fruitful and abundant always in the work of the
Lord ([Co1 15:58](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#058).md); he giveth us grace
to be fathers and mothers of many good deeds, which are our children and
best heirs, eternizing our name for ever. - John Boys.

[Psa 113:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#009.md)

"The barren woman" is the poor, forsaken, distressed Christian church,
whom the false church oppresses, defies, and persecutes, and regards as
useless, miserable, barren, because she herself is greater and more
populous, the greatest part of the world. - Joshua Arndt, 1626-1685.

[Psa 113:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#009.md)

"Praise ye the Lord." We may look abroad, and see abundant occasion for
praising God, - in his condescension to human affairs, - in his lifting
up the poor from the humblest condition, - in his exalting those of
lowly rank to places of honour, trust, wealth, and power; but, after
all, if we wish to find occasions of praise that will most tenderly
affect the heart, and be connected with the warmest affections of the
soul, they will be most likely to be found in the domestic circle - in
the mutual love - the common joy - the tender feelings - which bind
together the members of a family. - Albert Barnes.

[Psa 113:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#009.md)

"Praise ye the Lord." The very hearing of the comfortable changes which
the Lord can make and doth make the afflicted to find, is a matter of
refreshment to all, and of praise to God from all. - David Dickson.

[Psalms 113:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 113:1</span></span>

1 Praise ye the Lord. Praise, O ye servants of the Lord, praise the name
of the Lord.

2 Blessed be the name of the Lord from this time forth and for evermore.

3 From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the Lord's
name is to be praised.

4 The Lord is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens.

5 Who is like unto the Lord our God, who dwelleth on high,

6 Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in
the earth!

7 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of
the dunghill;

8 That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people.

9 He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of
children. Praise ye the Lord.

[Psa 113:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001.md)

"Praise ye the Lord," or Hallelujah, praise to Jah Jehovah. Praise is an
essential offering at all the solemn feasts of the people of God. Prayer
is the myrrh, and praise is the frankincense, and both of these must be
presented unto the Lord. How can we pray for mercy for the future if we
do not bless God for his love in the past? The Lord hath wrought all
good things for us, let us therefore adore him. All other praise is to
be excluded, the entire devotion of the soul must be poured out unto
Jehovah only. "Praise, O ye servants of the Lord." Ye above all men, for
ye are bound to do so by your calling and profession. If God's own
servants do not praise him, who will? Ye are a people near unto him, and
should be heartiest in your loving gratitude. While they were slaves of
Pharaoh, the Israelites uttered groans and sighs by reason of their hard
bondage; but now that they had become servants of the Lord, they were to
express themselves in songs of joy. His service is perfect freedom, and
those who fully enter into it discover in that service a thousand
reasons for adoration. They are sure to praise God best who serve him
best; indeed, service is praise. "Praise the name of the Lord" : extol
his revealed character, magnify every sacred attribute, exult in all his
doings, and reverence the very name by which he is called. The name of
Jehovah is thrice used in this verse, and may by us who understand the
doctrine of the Trinity in Unity be regarded as a thinly veiled allusion
to that holy mystery. Let Father, Son and Holy Spirit, all be praised as
the one, only, living, and true God. Tile close following of the words,
"Hallelujah, Hallelu, Hallelu," must have had a fine effect in the
public services. Dr. Edersheim describes the temple service as
responsive, and says "Every first line of a Psalm was repeated by the
people, while to each of the others they responded by a 'Hallelu Jah' or
'Praise ye the Lord: thus -

The Levites began: 'Hallelujah' (Praise ye the Lord).

The people repeated: 'Hallelu Jah.'

The Levites: 'Praise (Hallelu), O ye servants of Jehovah.'

The people responded: 'Hallelu Jah.'

The Levites: 'Praise (Hallelu) the name of Jehovah.'

The people responded: 'Hallelu Jah.'"

These were not vain repetitions, for the theme is one which we ought to
dwell upon; it should be deeply impressed upon the soul, and
perseveringly kept prominent in the life.

[Psa 113:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#002.md)

"Blessed be the name of the Lord." While praising him aloud, the people
were also to bless him in the silence of their hearts, wishing glory to
his name, success to his cause, and triumph to his truth. By mentioning
the name, the Psalmist would teach us to bless each of the attributes of
the Most High, which are as it were the letters of his name; not
quarrelling with his justice or his severity, nor servilely dreading his
power, but accepting him as we find him revealed in the inspired word
and by his own acts, and loving him and praising him as such. We must
not give the Lord a new name nor invent a new nature, for that would be
the setting up of a false god. Every time we think of the God of
Scripture we should bless him, and his august name should never be
pronounced without joyful reverence. "From this time forth." If we have
never praised him before, let us begin now. As the Passover stood at the
beginning of the year it was well to commence the new year with blessing
him who wrought deliverance for his people. Every solemn feast had its
own happy associations, and might be regarded as a fresh starting-place
for adoration. Are there not reasons why the reader should make the
present day the opening of a year of praise? When the Lord says, "From
this time will I bless you," we ought to reply, "Blessed be the name of
the Lord from this time forth."

"And for evermore" : eternally. The Psalmist could not have intended
that the divine praise should cease at a future date however remote.
"For evermore" in reference to the praise of God must signify endless
duration: are we wrong in believing that it bears the same meaning when
it refers to gloomier themes? Can our hearts ever cease to praise the
name of the Lord? Can we imagine a period in which the praises of Israel
shall no more surround the throne of the Divine Majesty? Impossible. For
ever, and more than "for ever," if more can be, let him be magnified.

[Psa 113:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#003.md)

"From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the Lord's
name is lo be praised." From early morn till eve tile ceaseless hymn
should rise unto Jehovah's throne, and from east to west over the whole
round earth pure worship should be rendered unto his glory. So ought it
to be; and blessed be God, we are not without faith that so it shall be.
We trust that ere the world's dread evening comes, the glorious name of
the Lord will be proclaimed among all nations, and all people shall call
him blessed. At the first proclamation of the gospel the name of the
Lord was glorious throughout the whole earth; shall it not be much more
so ere the end shall be? At any rate, this is the desire of our souls.
Meanwhile, let us endeavour to sanctify every day with praise to God. At
early dawn let us emulate the opening flowers and the singing birds,

"Chanting every day their lauds,

While the grove their song applauds;

Wake for shame my sluggish heart,

Wake and gladly sing thy part."

It is a marvel of mercy that the sun should rise on the rebellious sons
of men, and prepare for the undeserving fruitful seasons and days of
pleasantness; let us for this prodigy of goodness praise the Lord of
all. From hour to hour let us renew the strain, for each moment brings
its mercy; and when the sun sinks to his rest, let us not cease our
music, but lift up the vesper hymn -

"Father of heaven and earth!

I bless thee for the night,

The soft still night!

The holy pause of care and mirth,

Of sound and light.

Now far in glade and dell,

Flower-cup, and bud, and bell

Have shut around the sleeping woodlark's nest,

The bee's long-murmuring toils are done,

And I, the o'erwearied one,

Bless thee, O God, O Father of the oppressed!

With my last waking thought."

[Psa 113:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#004.md)

"The Lord is high above all nations." Though the Gentiles knew him not,
yet was Jehovah their ruler: their false gods were no gods, and their
kings were puppets in his hands. The Lord is high above all the
learning, judgment, and imagination of heathen sages, and far beyond the
pomp and might of the monarchs of the nations. Like the great arch of
the firmament, the presence of the Lord spans all the lands where dwell
the varied tribes of men, for his providence is universal' this may well
excite our confidence and praise. "And his glory above the heavens:"
higher than the loftiest part of creation; the clouds are the dust of
his feet, and sun, moon, and stars twinkle far below his throne. Even
the heaven of heavens cannot contain him. His glory cannot be set forth
by the whole visible universe, nor even by the solemn pomp of angelic
armies; it is above all conception and imagination, for he is God -
infinite. Let us above all adore him who is above all.

[Psa 113:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#005.md)

"Who is like unto the Lord our God?" The challenge will never be
answered. None can be compared with him for an instant; Israel's God is
without parallel; our own God in covenant stands alone, and none can be
likened unto him. Even those whom he has made like himself in some
respects are not like him in godhead, for his divine attributes are many
of them incommunicable and inimitable. None of the metaphors and figures
by which the Lord is set forth in the Scriptures can give us a complete
idea of him' his full resemblance is borne by nothing in earth or in
heaven. Only in Jesus is the Godhead seen, but he unhesitatingly
declared "he that hath seen me hath seen the Father." "Who dwelleth on
high." In the height of his abode none can be like him. His throne, his
whole character, his person, his being, everything about him, is lofty,
and infinitely majestic, so that none can be likened unto him. His
serene mind abides in the most elevated condition, he is never
dishonoured, nor does he stoop from the pure holiness and absolute
perfection of his character. His saints are said to dwell on high, and
in this they are the reflection of his glory; but as for himself, the
height of his dwelling-place surpasses thought, and he rises far above
the most exalted of his glorified people.

"Eternal Power! whose high abode

Becomes the grandeur of a God:

Infinite lengths beyond the bounds

Where stars revolve their little rounds.

"The lowest step around thy seat

Rises too high for Gabriel's feet;

In vain the tall archangel tries

To reach thine height with wond'ring eyes.

"Lord, what shall earth and ashes do?

We would adore our Maker too;

From sin and dust to thee we cry,

The Great, the Holy, and the High!"

[Psa 113:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#006.md)

"Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in
the earth!" He dwells so far on high that even to observe heavenly
things he must humble himself. He must stoop to view the skies, and bow
to see what angels do. What, then, must be his condescension, seeing
that he observes the humblest of his servants upon earth, and makes them
sing for joy like Mary when she said, "Thou hast regarded the low estate
of thine handmaiden." How wonderful are those words of Isaiah, "For thus
saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is
Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a
contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to
revive the heart of the contrite ones." Heathen philosophers could not
believe that the great God was observant of the small events of human
history; they pictured him as abiding in serene indifference to all the
wants and woes of his creatures. "Our Rock is not as their rock"; we
have a God who is high above all gods, and yet who is our Father,
knowing what we have need of before we ask him; our Shepherd, who
supplies our needs; our Guardian, who counts the hairs of our heads; our
tender and considerate Friend, who sympathizes in all our griefs. Truly
the name of our condescending God should be praised wherever it is
known.

[Psa 113:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#007.md)

"He raiseth up the poor out of the dust." This is an instance of his
gracious stoop of love: he frequently lifts the lowest of mankind out of
their poverty and degradation, and places them in positions of power and
honour. His good Spirit is continually visiting the down-trodden, giving
beauty for ashes to those who are cast down, and elevating the hearts of
his mourners till they shout for joy. These upliftings of grace are here
ascribed directly to the divine hand, and truly those who have
experienced them will not doubt the fact that it is the Lord alone who
brings his people up from the dust of sorrow and death. When no hand but
his can help he interposes, and the work is done. It is worth while to
be cast down to be so divinely raised from the dust. "And lifteth the
needy out of the dunghill," whereon they lay like worthless refuse, cast
off and cast out, left as they thought to rot into destruction and to be
everlastingly forgotten. How great a stoop from the height of his throne
to a dunghill! How wonderful that power which occupies itself in lifting
up beggars, all befouled with the filthiness in which they lay! For he
lifts them out of the dunghill, not disdaining to search them out from
amidst the base things of the earth that he may by their means bring to
nought the great ones, and pour contempt upon all human glowing. What a
dunghill was that upon which we lay by nature! What a mass of corruption
is our original estate! What a heap of loathsomeness we have accumulated
by our sinful lives! What reeking abominations surround us in the
society of our fellow men! We could never have risen out of all this by
our own efforts, it was a sepulchre in which we saw corruption, and were
as dead men. Almighty were the arms which lifted us, which are still
lifting us, and will lift us into the perfection of heaven itself.
Praise ye the Lord.

[Psa 113:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#008.md)

"That he may set him with princes." The Lord does nothing by halves:
when he raises men from the dust he is not content till he places them
among the peers of his kingdom. We are made kings and priests unto God,
and we shall reign for ever and ever. Instead of poverty, he gives us
the wealth of princes; and instead of dishonour, he gives us a more
exalted rank than that of the great ones of the earth. "Even with the
princes of his people." All his people are princes, and so the text
teaches us that God places needy souls whom he favours among the princes
of princes. He often enables those who have been most despairing to rise
to the greatest heights of spirituality and gracious attainment, for
those who once were last shall be first. Paul, though less than the
least of all saints was, nevertheless, made to be not a whit behind the
very chief of the apostles; and in our own times, Bunyan, the
blaspheming tinker, was raised into another John, whose dream almost
rivals the visions of the Apocalypse.

"Wonders of grace to God belong,

Repeat his mercies in your song."

Such verses as these should give great encouragement to those who are
lowest in their own esteem. The Lord poureth contempt upon princes; but
as for those who are in the dust and on the dunghill, he looks upon them
with compassion, acts towards them in grace, and in their case displays
the riches of his glory by Christ Jesus. Those who have experienced such
amazing favour should sing continual hallelujahs to the God of their
salvation.

[Psa 113:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#009.md)

"He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of
children." The strong desire of the easterns to have children caused the
birth of offspring to be hailed as the choicest of favours, while
barrenness was regarded as a curse; hence this verse is placed last as
if to crown the whole, and to serve as a climax to the story of God's
mercy. The glorious Lord displays his condescending grace in regarding
those who are despised on account of their barrenness, whether it be of
body or of soul. Sarah, Rachel, the wife of Manoah, Hannah, Elizabeth,
and others were all instances of the miraculous power of God in
literally fulfilling the statement of the Psalmist. Women were not
supposed to have a house till they had children; but in certain cases
where childless women pined in secret the Lord visited them in mercy,
and made them not only to have a house, but to keep it. The Gentile
church is a spiritual example upon a large scale of the gift of
fruitfulness after long years of hopeless barrenness; and the Jewish
church in the latter days will be another amazing display of the same
quickening power: long forsaken for her spiritual adultery, Israel shall
be forgiven, and restored, and joyously shall she keep that house which
now is left unto her desolate. Nor is this all, each believer in the
Lord Jesus must at times have mourned his lamentable barrenness; he has
appeared to be a dry tree yielding no fruit to the Lord, and yet when
visited by the Holy Ghost, he has found himself suddenly to be like
Aaron's rod, which budded, and blossomed, and brought forth almonds. Or
ever we have been aware, our barren heart has kept house, and
entertained the Saviour, our graces have been multiplied as if many
children had come to us at a single birth, and we have exceedingly
rejoiced before the Lord. Then have we marvelled greatly at the Lord who
dwelleth on high, that he has deigned to visit such poor worthless
things. Like Mary, we have lifted up our Magnificat, and like Hannah, we
have said "There is none holy as the Lord; for there is none beside
thee: neither is there any rock like our God."

"Praise ye the Lord." The music concludes upon its key-note. The Psalm
is a circle, ending where it began, praising the Lord from its first
syllable to its last. May our life-psalm partake of the same character,
and never know a break or a conclusion. In an endless circle let us
bless the Lord, whose mercies never cease. Let us praise him in youth,
and all along our years of strength; and when we bow in the ripeness of
abundant age, let us still praise the Lord, who doth not cast off his
old servants. Let us not only praise God ourselves, but exhort others to
do it; and if we meet with any of the needy who have been enriched, and
with the barren who have been made fruitful, let us join with them in
extolling the name of him whose mercy endureth for ever. Having been
ourselves lifted from spiritual beggary and barrenness, let us never
forget our former estate or the grace which has visited us, but world
without end let us praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
