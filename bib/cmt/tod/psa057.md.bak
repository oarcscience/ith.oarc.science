### [Psalms Chapter 57](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 57:0</span></span>

Title - To the Chief Musician - So glad a song as this becomes ere it
closes, should be in the keeping of the most skilled of all the temple
minstrels. Al-taschith, i.e., Destroy. This petition is a very
sententious prayer, as full as it is brief, and well worthy to be the
motto for a sacred song. David had said, "destroy not," in reference to
Saul, when he had him in his power and now he takes pleasure in
employing the same words in supplication to God. We may infer from the
spirit of the Lord's prayer, that the Lord will spare us as we spare our
foes. There are four of these "Destroy not" Psalms, namely, the [Psa
57:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md), [Psa
58:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#001.md), 59th, and [Psa
75:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#001.md). In all them there is a
distinct declaration of the destruction of the wicked and the
preservation of the righteous, and they all have probably a reference to
the overthrow of the Jews, on account of their persecution of the great
Son of David: they will endure heavy chastisement, but concerning them
it is written in the divine decree, "Destroy them not." Michtam of
David. For quality this Psalm is called golden, or a secret, and it well
deserves the name. 'We may read the words and yet not know the secret
joy of David, Which he has locked up in this golden casket. When he fled
from Saul in the cave. This is a song from the bowels of the earth, and,
like Jonah's prayer from the bottom of the sea, it has a taste of the
place. The poet is in the shadow of the cave at first, but he comes to
the cavern's mouth at last, and sings in the sweet fresh air, with his
eye on the heavens, watching joyously the clouds floating therein.

Divisions - We have here prayer, [Psa
57:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md), and praise[Psa
57:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#007.md). The hunted one takes a long
breath of prayer, and when he is fully inspired, he breathes out his
soul in jubilant song.

Hints to Preachers

[Psa 57:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001) (first clause.md) - Repetition
in prayer.

I. Its dangers. May degenerate into "vain repetitions." Carried to
excess painfully suggests the idea, God is unwilling.

II\. Its uses. Eases the soul like tears. Manifests intense emotion.
Enables those of less mental activity to join in a general supplication.

\- R. A. Griffin.

[Psa 57:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md) - Here are -

I. Calamities.

1\. War.

2\. Pestilence.

3\. Privations.

4\. Sin, greatest of all.

5\. Death.

6\. Curse of a broken law.

II\. Here is a refuge from these calamities.

1\. In God.

2\. Specially in the mercy of God.

III\. There is flying to that refuge.

1\. By faith; "My soul trusteth in thee;" "Under the shadow," etc.

2\. By prayer; "Be," etc.

IV\. Here is continuance both in faith and prayer; "until," etc.

\- G. R.

[Psa 57:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md), [Psa
57:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#004.md), [Psa
57:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#006.md), [Psa
57:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#007.md) - Note the varying condition of
the same heart, at the Same time. "My soul trusteth in thee." "My soul
is among lions." "My soul is bowed down." "My heart is fixed."

[Psa 57:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#002.md) - Prayer to the performing
God. He performs all his promises, all my salvation, all my
preservation, all needed between here and heaven. Here he reveals his
omnipotence, his grace, his faithfulness, his immutability; and we are
bound to show our faith, patience, joy, and gratitude.

[Psa 57:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#002.md) - Strange reasons.

I. The Psalmist, in the depths of distress, cries to God, because he is
most high in glory. Surely this thought might well paralyse him with the
fear of divine inaccessibility, but the soul quickened with suffering,
sees through and beyond the metaphor, rejoices in the truth, "Though the
Lord be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly."

II\. He cries to God for help, because God Is performing all things for
him. Why urge him then? Prayer is the music to which "the mighty man of
war" goes forth to battle.

\- R. A. G.

[Psa 57:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#003.md) - The saint's comfort in
adversity.

I. All contingencies are provided for: "He shall (or will) send."

II\. The highest resources are available: "from heaven."

III\. The worst foes will be overcome in the end: "him that would
swallow me up."

IV\. By the holiest mean: "mercy and truth."

\- R. A. G.

[Psa 57:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#003.md) - The celestial messengers.
What they are. The certainty of their being sent. Their effectual
operation. The grateful receiver.

[Psa 57:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#003) (last clause.md) - The harmony
of the divine attributes in salvation. Mercy founded on truth, truth
vindicating mercy. Mercy without injustice, justice honoured in mercy.

[Psa 57:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#004.md) - "My soul is among lions."
How came I there? If for God's sake, then I may remember -

1\. So was my Lord in the wilderness.

2\. The lions are chained.

3\. Their howling is all they can do.

4\. I shall come out of their den alive, unhurt, honoured.

5\. The Lion of Judah is with me.

6\. I shall soon be among the angels.

[Psa 57:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#005.md) -

I. The end which God has in view, both in heaven and earth, in a sinful
and in sinless worlds - his own glory.

II\. Our duty to acquiesce in that end: "Be thou," etc. - not self, not
men, not angels - "Be thou exalted," etc. In this we would acquiesce -

1\. Actively, by seeking that end.

2\. Passively, by submission to his will.

\- G. R.

[Psa 57:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#006) (first clause.md) -

I. Who are they?

1\. Those who lead us into sin.

2\. Who argue from worldly philosophy.

3\. Who proclaim priestly and sacramental superstition.

4\. Who decoy us from the church of God.

5\. Who teach Antinomian doctrine.

II\. How shall we escape them?

1\. Keep out of their way.

2\. Keep to God's way.

3\. Trust daily in the Lord.

[Psa 57:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#006.md) - "My soul is bowed down."

I. The prostration.

1\. Caused by enemies, weakness, fear, pain.

2\. Deep, agonising, self-revealing.

3\. Common to the Head and the members.

II\. The consolation.

1\. Bowed down, but not condemned.

2\. Hoping in the promise.

3\. Trusting in God.

4\. Expecting a blessing from the trial.

[Psa 57:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#007) (first clause.md) - It is
implied that the "heart" is the main thing required in all acts of
devotion; nothing is done to purpose in religion further than it is done
with the heart. The heart must be "fixed;" fixed for the duty, fitted
and put in frame for it; fixed in the duty by a close application;
attending on the Lord without distraction - Matthew Henry.

[Psa 57:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#007.md) -

I. What is fixed? the heart, not the mind merely, but the will, the
conscience, the affections, which draw the mind after them: "My heart is
fixed;" - found an anchorage, a resting-place, not therefore at the
mercy of every gale, etc.

II\. The objects upon which it is fixed.

1\. Upon God.

2\. Upon his word.

3\. Upon his salvation.

4\. Upon heaven.

III\. The fixedness of the heart upon these objects, denotes -

1\. Singleness of aim.

2\. Uniformity of action.

3\. Perseverance to the end.

\- G. R.

[Psa 57:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#007.md), [Psa
57:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#008.md), [Psa
57:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#009.md) -

1\. He that will be thankful must treasure up in his heart and memory
the courtesy that is done him; so had David done, and therefore he
mentions his heart; and to make it more emphatical, he names it again,
"My heart."

2\. After he remembers it, he must be affected with it, and resolve upon
it; so doth David: "My heart is ready," or else, "My heart is fixed;"
confirmed I am in it to be thankful, and I cannot be altered.

3\. 'Tis not enough that a man carry about with him a thankful heart; he
must anunciare, tell it abroad, and make it known publicly what God hath
done for him; yea, and do it joyfully too: "I will," saith David, "sing
and give praise."

4\. He must use all means he can to make it known - "tongue,"
"psaltery," and "harp," all are little enough. Whence, by an apostrophe,
David turns to these. "Awake, my glory:" i.e. Tongue, awake; lute and
harp, awake; I myself will awake.

5\. He must not do it in a sleepy manner, but with intention and
earnestness of spirit: "Awake, awake, I will awake."

6\. He must take the first opportunity to do it, and not hang off and
delay it: "I will awake early."

7\. He must do it in such a place, and such an assembly as may most
redound to God's honour: "I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people:
I will sing unto thee among the nations."

\- William Nicholson.

[Psa 57:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#008.md) - "I myself will wake
early." I will sleep lightly, for I am in an enemy's country; I will ask
God to arouse me; I will set the alarum of watchfulness; I will hear the
cock of providential warning; the light of the Sun shall arouse me; the
activities of the church, the trumpet of my foes, and the bell of duty
shall combine to awaken me.

[Psa 57:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#009.md) - Who? "I." What? "Will
praise." Whom? "Thee, O Lord." Where? "Among the people." Why?

[Psa 57:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#009.md) - Public profession.

I. A necessity.

II\. A privilege.

III\. A duty.

\- R. A. G.

[Psa 57:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#010.md) - The mercy of God reaches
to the heavens -

I. As a throne, God is exalted in our eyes by his mercy.

II\. As a ladder. By mercy we ascend from earth to heaven.

III\. As a rainbow. Present and past mercies argue exemption for the
saints from the wrath of heaven.

IV\. As a mountain. Its base is on the earth though its summit is lost
in clouds. The influence of the cross towers to the heaven of heavens.
Who can tell the glory of the summit of this mountain, whose base is
refulgent with glory!

\- R. A. G.

[Psa 57:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#010.md) - The amazing greatness of
mercy. It is not said merely that it is high as heaven, but great unto
the heavens.

I. It is high as the heavens, over-topping the greatest sin, and highest
thought of man.

II\. It is wide as the far-reaching sky, compassing men of all ages,
countries, classes, etc.

III\. It is deep. Everything of God is proportionate; this, therefore,
is deep in abiding foundation, and infinite wisdom.

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Title

This Psalm was composed, as the title notes, by David prayer-wise, when
he hid himself from Saul in the cave, and is inscribed with a double
title, Al taschith, Michtam of David. Al taschith refers to the scope,
and Michtam to the dignity of the subject-matter. The former signifies
destroy not, or, let there be no slaughter; and may either refer to
Saul, concerning whom he gave charge to his servants not to destroy him;
or rather it hath reference to God, to whom in this great exigence he
poured out his soul in this pathetical ejaculation; Al-taschith, destroy
not. The latter title, Michtam, signifies a golden ornament, and so is
suited to the choice and excellent matter of the Psalm, which much more
deserves such a title than Pythagoras' golden verses did. - John Flavel
(1627-1691), in "Divine Conduct, or the' Mystery of Providence."

Title

A Psalm composed when David fled from Saul in the cave, which is
referred to in [Psa 142:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#001.md), and
which, because it is without any other distinction called "the cave," is
probably that celebrated cave where David with his six hundred followers
lay concealed when Saul entered and David cut off the skirt of his robe.
The king, accompanied by three thousand followers, chased him to the
loftiest alpine heights - "to the sheep-cotes," where the cattle where
driven in the hottest summer months only - to hunt him in every
hiding-place. There was a cave, in the darkened cool of which David and
his men were hid. Such caves in Palestine and the East are frequently
enlarged by human hands, and so capacious that they accommodate
thousands of people. This song of complaint was written during the hours
of suspense which David spent there, to wait until the calamity was
overpast (ver. 2); in which he only gradually gains a stout heart (ver.
8). His life was really suspended by a hair if Saul or any of his
attendants had espied him! - Augustus F. Tholuck, 1856.

Title

"The cave." There appear good grounds for the local tradition which
fixes the cave on the borders of the Dead Sea, although there is no
certainty with regard to the particular cave pointed out. The cave so
designated is at a point to which David was far more likely to summon
his parents, whom he intended to take from Bethlehem into Moab, than to
any place in the western plains.... It is an immense natural cavern, the
mouth of which can be approached only on foot along the side of the
cliff. Irby and Mangles, who visited it without being aware that is was
the reputed Cave of Adullam, state that it "runs in by a long winding,
narrow passage, with small chambers or cavities on either side. We soon
came to a large chamber with natural arches of great height; from this
last there were numerous passages, leading in all directions,
occasionally joined by others at right angles, and forming a perfect
labyrinth, which our guides assured us had never been perfectly explored
- the people being afraid of losing themselves. The passages are
generally four feet high by three feet wide, and were all on a level
with each other." ... It seems probable that David as a native of
Bethlehem, must have been well acquainted with this remarkable spot, and
had probably often availed himself of its shelter, when out with his
father's flocks. It would, therefore, naturally occur to him as a place
of refuge when he fled from Gath. - John Kitto (1804-1854), in "A
Cyclopaedia of Biblical Literature."

Whole Psalm

Mystically this hymn may be construed of Christ, who was in the days of
his flesh assaulted by the tyranny both of spiritual and temporal
enemies. His temporal enemies, Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the
Gentiles and people of Israel, furiously raged and took counsel together
against him. The chief priests and princes were, saith Hierome, like
lions, and the people like the whelps of lions, all of them in a
readiness to devour his soul. The rulers laid a net for his feet in
their captious interrogatories, asking ([Mat
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#017).md), "Is it lawful to give tribute
unto Caesar, or not?" and ([Joh 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#005).md)
whether the woman taken in the very act of adultery should be stoned to
death or no. The people were "set on fire," when as they raged against
him, and their teeth and tongues were spears and swords, in crying,
"Crucify him, crucify him." His spiritual enemies also sought to swallow
him up; his soul was among lions all the days of his life, at the hour
of his death especially. The devil in tempting and troubling him, had
laid a snare for his feet; and death, in digging a pit for him, had
thought to devour him. As David was in the cave, so Christ the Son of
David was in the grave. - John Boys, 1571-1625.

[Psa 57:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md)

"Be merciful unto me, O God," etc. This excellent Psalm was composed by
David when there was enough to discompose the best man in the world. The
repetition notes both the extremity of the danger, and the ardency of
the supplicant. Mercy! Mercy! Nothing but mercy, and that exerting
itself in an extraordinary way, can now save him from ruin. The
arguments he pleads for obtaining mercy in this distress ore very
considerable. 1. He pleads his reliance upon God as an argument to move
mercy. "My soul trusteth in thee," etc. This his trust and dependence
upon God, though it be not argumentative in respect of the dignity of
the act; yet it is so in respect both of the nature of the object, a
compassionate God, who will not expose any that take shelter under his
wings, and in respect of the promise, whereby protection is assured to
them that fly to him for sanctuary. [Isa
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#003.md). 2. He pleads former experiences
of his help in past distresses, as an argument encouraging hope under
the present strait ([Psa 57:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#002).md). - John
Flavel.

[Psa 57:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md)

"Be merciful unto me." According to the weight of the burden that
grieveth us, is the cry that comes from us. How do poor condemned
prisoners cry to their judges, "Have pity upon us, have pity upon us!"
David, in the day of his calamities doubles his prayer for mercy: "Be
merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in
thee," etc. "Until these calamities be overpast." It was not a single
calamity, but a multitude of calamities which compassed David, and
therefore he compasseth the Lord about with petitions. His spirit being
up in prayer, like a bell that rings out, he strikes on both sides, "Be
merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me." - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 57:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md)

"Be merciful unto me." The first clause contains the prayer itself in a
very forcible word חנּגי, properly, "Show thy most tender affection to
me," such as animals, with a humming sound, show to their young. -
Hermann Venema.

[Psa 57:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md)

"For my soul trusteth in thee." The best reason with God, who "taketh
pleasure in those that hope in his mercy." [Psa
147:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#011.md). - Pool's Synopsis.

[Psa 57:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md)

"Soul." His soul trusted in God; and this is a form of expression the
force of which is not to be overlooked; for it implies that the trust
which he exercised proceeded from his very innermost affections - that
it was of no volatile character, but deeply and strongly rooted. He
declares the same truth in figurative terms, when he adds his persuasion
that God would cover him with the shadow of his wings. - John Calvin.

[Psa 57:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md)

"In the shadow of thy wings I will trust;" properly, I will seek for
protection. The very delightful figure here employed, is taken from the
chicken lying safely hid under the mother's wings' at the same time it
seems to have reference to the wings of the cherubim, by which the
mercy-seat was covered. - Simon de Muis, 1587-1644.

[Psa 57:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md)

"The shadow of thy wings." Compare [Psa
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#008.md); [Psa
61:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#004.md); and [Mat
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037.md); and the Apocalyptic imagery,
describing the church fleeing from the dragon in the wilderness; and "to
her are given the two wings of the great eagle," and she is delivered
from the dragon, who desires to swallow her up. See [Rev
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#006.md), [Rev
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#015.md), [Rev
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#016.md). - Christopher Wordsworth, 1868.

[Psa 57:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md)

"Until these calamities be overpast." He compareth his affliction and
calamity to a storm that cometh and goeth: as it is not always fair
weather with us in this life, so not always foul. Athanasius said of
Julian furiously raging against the Lord's Anointed, "Nubecula est, cito
transibit," he is a little cloud; he will soon pass away. Man is born to
labour and dolor, to travail and trouble; to labour in his actions, to
dolor in his passions; and so, "Great are the troubles of the righteous,
but the Lord delivereth him out of all." If we put our trust in him and
cast all our care upon him, he will in his good time bring it to pass,
that all our afflictions shall overpass. He will either take them from
us or us from them, and then we shall assuredly know that the troubles
of this life present are not worthy of the glory which in the life to
come shall be showed unto us. For as the globe of the earth, which
improperly for his show of bigness we term the world, and is, after the
mathematician's account, many thousand miles in compass; yet, being
compared unto the greatness of the starry sky's circumference, is but a
centre or little prick: so the travail and affliction in this life
temporal, in respect of the joys eternal in the world to come, bear not
any proportion, but are to be reputed in comparison a very nothing, as a
dark cloud that cometh and goeth in a moment. - John Boys.

[Psa 57:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md), [Psa
57:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#002.md), [Psa
57:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#003.md)

"In the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until these
calamities be overpast," etc. As if he said, Lord, I am already in the
cave and in the hold, and in the shadow of it, but yet for all that I
think not myself safe indeed, till I have made my refuge in the shadow
of thy wings: that is therefore the course I resolve and build upon. It
was wisely done of him: and mark what course he takes to do it, [Psa
57:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#002.md), "I will cry unto God most high,
"I will by prayer put myself under the shadow of God's wings; and mark
what success should follow, [Psa 57:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#003.md),
'He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of him that
would swallow me up. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth." When
we send prayers up to heaven, God will send help down from heaven. But
yet David prays to God, as well as trusts in God. And unless we pray as
well as trust, our trust will fail us, for we must trust to God for that
we pray for. - Jeremiah Dyke, 1620.

[Psa 57:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#002.md)

"Unto God that performeth all things for me." God's favours already
received are a pledge that he will complete his work of love "upon (על)
me." The beginning is the earnest of the completion. His word is a
guarantee for the performance of "all things" that I need. (Compare [Psa
57:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#003.md); [Psa
56:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#004.md); [Sa1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#009.md); [Sa1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#012.md); [Sa1
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#017.md); [Sa1
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#021.md); [Psa
128:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#001.md) :8; [Job
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#003.md), [Job
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#008.md); [Job
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#015.md); [Phi
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006.md); [Isa
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#012).md). - A. R. Fausset.

[Psa 57:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#002.md)

"God that performeth all things for me." Heb that performeth (or
perfecteth, or finisheth, as this word is rendered, [Psa
38:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#008.md) i.e., will certainly perform or
finish), for, or towards, or concerning me. He doth not express what he
performeth, or perfecteth, or fulfilleth, but leaveth it to be
understood, as being easy to be understood. "He performeth" or
perfecteth, to wit, all that he hath promised; engaged himself to
perform what he hath begun to do, or what is yet to be performed; it
being usual in the Hebrew language to understand a verbal noun after the
verb. He implies that God is not like men, who make large promises, but
either through inability, or carelessness, or unfaithfulness, do not
perform them, but will certainly be as good as his word. - Matthew Pool,
1624-1679.

[Psa 57:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#002) (last clause.md)

The word which we translate "performeth" comes from a root that
signifies both to perfect and to desist or cease. For when a business is
performed and perfected, the agent then ceases and desists from working:
he puts to the last hand when he finishes the work. To such a happy
issue the Lord hath brought all his doubtful and difficult matters
before; and this gives him encouragement that he will still be gracious,
and perfect that which concerneth him now, as he speaks, [Psa
138:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#008.md), "The Lord will perfect that
which concerneth me." The Septuagint renders it by τόν ἐυεργετη σοντά
με, who profiteth or benefiteth me. And it is a certain truth, that all
the results and issues of providence are profitable and beneficial to
the saints. But the supplement in our translation well conveys the
importance of the place: "who performeth all things;" and it involves
the most strict and proper notion of providence, which is nothing else
but the performance of God's gracious purposes and promises to his
people. And therefore Vatablus and Muis supply and fill up the room
which the conciseness of the original leaves, with quae promisit: "I
will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth the things which
he hath promised." Payment is the performance of promises. Grace makes
the promise, and providence the payment. Piscator fills it with
benignitatem et misericordiam suam; "unto God that performeth his
kindness and mercy." But still it supposes the mercy performed to be
contained in the promise, and much more so in the providential
performance of it to us. - John Flavel.

[Psa 57:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#002) (last clause.md)

David even then when he fled from Saul in the cave he looks upon God as
having performed all things for him. The word is, he hath perfected all
things; and it is observable that David uses the same expression of
praising God here when he was in the cave, hiding himself to save his
life as he did when he triumphed over his enemies. - [Psa
6:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001.md) and [Psa
108:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#001.md) - Jeremiah Burroughs,
1599-1646.

The Targum curiously paraphrases this clause: "Who ordered the spider
that wrought the web, on my account, at the mouth of the cave; applying
a later historical fact, which, however, may have had its prototype in
David's history. - Andrew A. Bonar, in "Christ and his Church in the
Book of Psalms," 1859.

[Psa 57:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#003.md)

"Him that would swallow me up." If I were to take you to my house, and
say that I had an exquisitely fat man, and wished you to join me in
eating him, your indignation could be restrained by nothing. You would
pronounce me to be crazy. There is not in New York a man so mean that he
would not put down a man who should propose to have a banquet off from a
fellow man, cutting steaks out of him, and eating them. And that is
nothing but feasting on the human body, while they all will sit down,
and take a man's soul, and look for the tender loins, and invite their
neighbours in to partake of the little titbits. They will take a man's
honour and name, and broil them over the coals of their indignation, and
fill the whole room with the aroma thereof, and give their neighbour a
piece, and watch him, and wink as he tastes it. You all eat men up....
You eat the souls, the finest elements of men. You are more than glad if
you can whisper a word that is derogatory to a neighbour, or his wife,
or his daughter.... The morsel is too exquisite to be lost. Here is the
soul of a person, here is a person's hope for this world and the world
to come, and you have it on your fork, and you cannot refrain from
tasting it, and give it to some one else to taste. You are cannibals,
eating men's honour and name and rejoicing in it - and that, too, when
you do not always know that the things charged against them are true;
when in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred the probabilities are that
they are not true. - Henry Ward Beecher, 1870.

[Psa 57:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#003.md)

"God shall send forth his mercy and his truth," viz., to save me. That
is to say, God, to manifest his mercy, and vindicate the truth of his
promises, will save me. The reader will observe, that mercy and truth
are here poetically represented as ministers of God, standing in his
presence, ready to execute his pleasure, and employed by him in the
salvation of his people. - Samuel Chandler.

[Psa 57:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#003.md)

"His mercy and his truth." He need not send down angels, he need send
but "mercy and truth" down, which elsewhere it is said he prepares in
the heavens. [Psa 61:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#007.md). He prepares
commissions for them, and sends them down with them for execution. -
Thomas Goodwin.

[Psa 57:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#004.md)

"My soul is among lions." This may also be construed of the church and
that both in respect of her spiritual enemies and temporal. As for her
ghostly foes, the devil is a roaring lion ([Pe1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008).md), and our sins are the whelps of
lions, ready to devour us. And concerning outward enemies, the church in
this world is like Daniel in the lion's den, or as "the sucking child
playing upon the hole of the asp." [Isa
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#008.md). She hath here no visible power
or outward help to fly to for succour, all her trust is in the Lord, and
"under the shadow of his wings is her refuge, till this evil is
overpast".... And surely, beloved, if the church had not any other
enemies, but only these monstrous Antichrists of Rome, yet she might
truly complain with our prophet here, "My soul is among lions." Eleven
popes had that name, whereof all, excepting two or three, were roaring
lions in their Bulls, and ravening lions in seeking after their prey.
Leo the tenth so pilledand polledthe goodly nations of Germany with his
impardonable pardons and merciless indulgences, as that his
insupportable cruelty gave the first occasion of the Reformation of
religion in that country. - John Boys.

[Psa 57:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#004) (first clause.md)

"Mudge translates literally, 'I lie with my soul amidst lionesses.'"
This agrees with the opinion of Bochart, who thinks that the animals
here intended are lionesses, properly, when giving suck to their young,
a time when they are peculiarly fierce and dangerous, "nor need we
wonder," he observes, "that the lioness is reckoned among the fiercest
lions; for the lioness equals, or even exceeds, the lion in strength and
fierceness;" and this he proves from the testimonies of ancient writers.
- James Anderson's Note to Calvin in loc., 1846.

[Psa 57:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#004.md)

"And I lie even among them that are set on fire." The whole pith lies in
the word אשׁכּבה, I will recline, which denotes a tranquil and secure
condition of body and mind, like a man reclining and sleeping, as [Psa
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#005.md) : "I laid me down and slept, I
awaked;" and lived composedly; Ps. 4:9; "I will both lay me down in
peace," etc. - Hermann Venema.

[Psa 57:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#004.md)

The horrors of a lion's den, the burning of a fiery furnace, and the
cruel onset of war, are the striking images by which David here
describes the peril and wretchedness of his present condition. - John
Morison.

[Psa 57:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#006.md)

"Net." Not having fire-arms, the ancients were much more skilful than
the moderns in the use of snares, nets, and pits for capturing wild
animals. A large class of Biblical figures and allusions necessarily
presupposes this state of things. - W. M. Thomson.

[Psa 57:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#007.md)

"My heart is fixed, O God," etc. The Psalmist, knowing that it is the
order and work of God, first to prepare the heart for communion, and
then to incline his own ear to hear his people, and to entertain
communion with them in ordinances, he doth observe this order, and
follow it with a practise suitable to it in his daily addresses to God,
that is thus, wheresoever he doth find his heart put into a fitted and
prepared frame for communion with God, he doth not let it die again, and
go out of frame by a slothful neglect of such a disposition of heart.
No, but he immediately sets himself to duty, to worship God, and to the
acts of his worship, in his ordinances, as he expresseth himself in [Psa
57:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#007.md); viz., thus - נכון לבּי אלהים
נכון לבּי, Nachon libbi Elohim, nachon libbi (there is the first; he
finds his heart fitted and prepared for communion with God): "My heart,"
saith he, "is fitted or prepared" (for the word נכון, nachon is the
passive conjugation niphal, signifying, he is fitted or prepared from
the root, כּזּן chun, he fitted or prepared, in the active; and so it is
rather to be rendered prepared or fitted, then "fixed," thus: לבּי,
libbi, my heart; נכון, nachon, is fitted or prepared), "O God, my heart
is fitted or prepared "for communion with thee. Well, what follows? He
presently sets himself upon that great duty and ordinance of communion
with God, in the praising of his name and singing forth those praises,
as in the words immediately following in the same verse, thus: "My heart
is prepared, O God, my heart is prepared:" therefore, ואזמּרה, ashidah
va-azamerah, "I will sing and give praise." - William Strong, in
"Communion with God," 1656.

[Psa 57:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#007.md)

"My heart is fixed, O God," etc. Fitness for duty lies in the orderly
temper of body and mind, making a man willing to undertake, and able to
finish his work with comfortable satisfaction. If either the body or
mind be distempered, a man is unfit for such an undertaking; both must
be in a suitable frame, like a well-tuned instrument, else there will be
no melody: hence when David prepared himself for praises and worship, he
tells us his heart was ready and fixed, and then, his tongue was ready
also ([Psa 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#001)..md), so was his hand
with Psaltery and harp; all these were awakened into a suitable posture.
That a man is or hath been in a fit order for service may be concluded
from (1.) His alacrity to undertake a duty. (2.) His activity in the
prosecution. (3.) His satisfaction afterward. Right grounds and
principles in these things being still pre-supposed. - Richard Gilpin,
(1625-1699, 1700) in "Daemonologia Sacra."

[Psa 57:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#007.md)

"I will sing." It should alarm the wicked that they are contending with
a people who sing and shout on the battle-field. Yea, they never sing
louder than when most distressed and afflicted. Whether saints conquer
or are conquered they still sing on. Blessed be God for that. Let
sinners tremble at contending with men of a spirit so heavenly. -
William S. Plumer.

[Psa 57:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#007.md)

Sincerity makes the Christian sing, when he hath nothing to his supper,
David was in none of the best case when in the cave, yet we never find
him merrier: his heart makes sweeter music than ever his harp did. -
William Gurnall.

[Psa 57:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#007.md), [Psa
57:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#008.md)

That worship that is performed with a sleepy, drowsy body, is a weak
worship, but the Psalmist here makes the awaking of the body to be the
fruit and effect of the preparation of the heart; "Awake up, my glory;
awake, Psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early." Why so? My heart
is prepared. The heart prepared and thereby awakened, will awake the
body. To worship God therefore without a prepared heart, is to worship
him with a drowsy body, because with a drowsy heart, and therefore
weakly. - John Angler, in "An Help to better Hearts, for better Times,"
1647.

[Psa 57:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#008.md)

"Awake up, mg glory; awake, Psaltery and harp: I myself will awake
early." We must prevent God by early praise as well as prayer; "The God
of my mercy shall prevent me," sings David; and every child of David
must prevent God again with his songs. Jehoshaphat delighted God with
instruments of music before his deliverance. Faith must tune an
επινίκιον, a psalm of victory before the triumph. Praise is the
ingenious mother of future mercies; as the Virgin Mary sang at Hebron
before the birth of her son at Bethlehem. Oh, heavenly contention
between mercy and duty! - Samuel Lee, 1625-1691.

[Psa 57:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#008.md)

"Awake up, my glory," etc. We must sing with excited grace. Not only
with grace habitual, but with excited and actual: the musical instrument
delights not but when it is played upon. In this duty we must follow
Paul's advice to Timothy ([Ti2 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#006).md),
ἀναζωπυρεῖν, stir up the grace that is in us, and cry out as David,
"Awake love, awake delight." [Psa
57:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#008.md). The clock must be wound up
before it can guide our time; the bird pleaseth not in her nest, but in
her notes; the chimes only make music while they are going. Let us
therefore beg the Spirit to blow upon our garden, that the spices
thereof may flow out, when we set upon this joyous service. God loves
active grace in duty, that the soul should be ready trimmed when it
presents itself to Christ in any worship. - John Wells, in "Morning
Exercises," 1674.

[Psa 57:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#008.md)

"I will awake early," Literally, "I will awake the dawn," a bold figure
of poetry, as if the writer had said - The morning shall not awake me to
praise; but in my songs I will anticipate the dawn. - R. T. Society's
Notes.

[Psa 57:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#008.md)

It will answer our purpose to take notice, first, of the terms David
uses, and then, secondly, press the exhortation. Of the terms he uses:
1. My glory. That is my soul (say some) because the spirit of a man is
the glory of a man, whereby he is dignified and raised so much above the
brutes, as to be but a "little lower than the angels," nay, to be akin
to God himself, "the Father of spirits." My musical skill, say others,
the glory of the artist above the unskilful; and that wherein David had
the glory of excelling, as Jubal had of the first invention. My tongue,
say others; for this is also the glory of a man above dumb creatures,
and the glory of a wise man above a fool. And as the tongue is the glory
of a man, so the glory of the tongue is to glorify God. Praise is the
glory of all other uses to which the tongue is employed; and the tongue
is, in the body, that "temple of the Holy Ghost," what the silver
trumpet was in the temple of Solomon; to sound the high praises of God,
and express the raised affections of our souls.

2\. "Awake Psaltery and harp." The one for a Psalm, the other for a
spiritual song or hymn; that is to say, all my musical instruments and
skill I will employ in, and consecrate to the glory of him who "puts new
songs into my mouth." He first teaches my fingers to fight, and then to
play the epinikion, or song of triumph. Sound, then my Psaltery and
harp, emulous of those that are around the throne above; your melody can
soften my cares, lay my fears, and turn my cave into a choir. As to
these instruments in the worship of God, they were doubtless allowed to
David, and to the church in his time. They were agreeable to the state
of that church and people, who were led very much by their senses; and
whose infant and less discerning condition made it needful for the
natural man to have something to fasten upon and be entertained with in
the worship of God, and to sweeten and take off from the labour and
burden of that service. But as the gospel worship and appointments are a
more spiritual, pleasant, and reasonable service, and need them less, so
in the gospel institution we find no footsteps of them; and we know who
first brought them into the church, as well as who first brought them
into the world. It is not my business here to dispute this matter; and
he must at any time do it but indifferently, whose inclination is
against him all the while, and whose genius tempts him to wish himself
solidly confuted in all he can advance. But since I find these
instruments in my text, and since the sound of such texts as these is
made use of to turn the public worship so frequently into concerts of
music, I shall leave them with this remark: that to let them alone,
especially in public worship, though one thought them tolerable, has a
much better grace with it than to declare them "sorely displeasing to
God, and that they filthily defile his holy house and place of prayer."

3\. "I myself will awake early." And without this, all the rest had been
an empty sound; there would have been no melody to the Lord, whatsoever
good music he might have made to himself. He would not put God off with
a sacrifice of mere air. He summons the attendance of all his powers.
Himself is the offering; and his music plays to the sacrifice, as it
goes up in holy affections and spiritual joys; and unless these
accompany the song, the mere breath of an organ, or the trembling of the
strings of an harp is as good devotion and less offensive to God.
Consider the nature and excellency of the duty. Singing Psalms is a
compound of several other duties. It contains prayer to a very great
advantage: the stretch of the voice does humour and lead on the earnest
reaching of the mind after the desired blessing. It is the very element
and breath of praise; and the apostle tells us that "teaching and
admonishing one another" is performed in singing "Psalms and hymns and
spiritual songs." For when we sing of judgment, it is awakening to
sinners; and when we sing of mercy, it is comforting to all. Meditation
cannot have a better help. The solemn movement of the time gives room
for the mind to compass the full sense of the matter, and to impress it
deep; and while the tongue is making the pause, the heart may make
elevation. In short, it gives an accent to all duty; it is the music of
all other ordinances; it is adapted and suited to all circumstances; as
appears from the Psalms composed upon all occasions and subjects,
doctrinal, prophetical, hortatory, and historical; of praise and prayer,
of grief and joy, in the penitential and complaining, in the triumphal
and rejoicing; as if singing of psalms could stand for everything, and,
like the manna in the wilderness, gives a taste of all the other food we
enjoy in the house of God. - Benjamin Grosvenor, D.D. (1675 - 1758), in
"An Exhortation to the Duty of Singing." Eastcheap Lectures, 1810.

[Psa 57:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#008.md)

The Psaltery was a stringed instrument, usually with twelve strings, and
played with the fingers. The harp or lyre was a stringed instrument,
usually consisting of ten strings. Josephus says that it was struck or
played with a key. It appears, however, that it was sometimes played
with the fingers. - Albert Barnes.

[Psa 57:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#009.md)

"I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people." The Spirit of God who
indited this scripture, made his penman know that the Gentiles should
have the use of his Psalms. - David Dickson.

[Psa 57:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#009.md)

"The people" - "the nations." The Hebrew church was neither called nor
qualified to be a missionary society, but it never ceased to desire and
hope for the conversion of the nations. This is seen in those passages
in which the Psalmists betray a consciousness that they shall one day
have all the world for auditors. How boldly does David exclaim, "I will
sing unto thee among the nations." In the same spirit, a later Psalmist
summons the church to lift up her voice, so that all the nations may
hear her recital of the Lord's mighty acts: "O give thanks unto the
Lord; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people." [Psa
105:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#001.md). The full import of this class
of texts is often hidden from the English reader by the circumstance
that our translators have hardly ever used the word people in its plural
form. Twice in the Revelation they venture to write peoples; everywhere
else the singular form has to do duty for both numbers; so that in not a
few passages the sense is greatly obscured to those who have no access
either to the original or to other versions. In the Psalms, in
particular, the mention of the Gentiles is more frequent than the
English reader is made aware of. It is to be observed, moreover, that in
addition to this strain of indirect prediction, the conversion of the
world is articulately celebrated in many glorious Psalms. Indeed, so
numerous are these, and so generally distributed over the centuries
between David and Ezra, that it would seem that at no time during the
long history of inspired Psalmody, did the Spirit cease to indite new
songs in which the children of Zion might give utterance to their
world-embracing hopes. - William Binnie, D.D., in "The Psalms' their
History, Teachings, and Use," 1870.

[Psa 57:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#010.md), [Psa
57:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#011.md)

A hard and ungrateful heart beholds even in prosperity only isolated
drops of divine grace; but a grateful one like David's, though chased by
persecutors, and striking the harp in the gloom of a cave, looks upon
the mercy and faithfulness of God as a mighty ocean, waving and heaving
from the earth to the clouds, and from the clouds to the earth again. -
Augustus F. Tholuck.

[Psa 57:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#011.md)

"Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens," etc. Greater words of
prayer than these never came from human lips. Heaven and earth have as
they imply, a mutually interwoven history, and the blessed, glorious end
of this is in the sunrise of the Divine glory over both. - Franz
Delitzsch, 1869.

[Psalms 57:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 57:1</span></span>

1 Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me for my soul trusteth
in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until
these calamities be overpast.

2 I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all things for
me.

3 He shall send groin heaven, and save me from the reproach of him that
would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his
truth.

4 My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set on
fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their
tongue a sharp sword.

5 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above all
the earth.

6 They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they
have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen
themselves. Selah.

[Psa 57:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md)

"Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me." Urgent need suggests
the repetition of the cry, for thus intense urgency of desire is
expressed. If "he gives twice who gives quickly," so he who would
receive quickly must ask twice. For mercy the Psalmist pleads at first,
and he feels he cannot improve upon his plea, and therefore returns to
it. God is the God of mercy, and the Father of mercies, it is most fit
therefore that in distress we should seek mercy from him in whom it
dwells. "For my soul trusteth in thee." Faith urges her suit right well.
How can the Lord be unmerciful to a trustful soul? Our faith does not
deserve mercy, but it always wins it from the sovereign grace of God
when it is sincere, as in this case where the soul of the man believed.
"With the heart man believeth unto righteousness." "Yea, in the shadow
of thy wings will I make my refuge." Not in the cave alone would he
hide, but in the cleft of the Rock of ages. As the little birds find
ample shelter beneath the parental wing, even so would the fugitive
place himself beneath the secure protection of the divine power. The
emblem is delightfully familiar and suggestive. May we all
experimentally know its meaning. When we cannot see the sunshine of
God's face, it is blessed to cower down beneath the shadow of his wings.
"Until these calamities be overpast." Evil will pass away, and the
eternal wings will abide over us till then. Blessed be God, our
calamities are matters of time, but our safety is a matter of eternity.
When we are under the divine shadow, the passing over of trouble cannot
harm us; the hawk flies across the sky, but this is no evil to the
chicks when they are safely nestling beneath the hen.

[Psa 57:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#002.md)

"I will cry." He is quite safe, but yet he prays, for faith is never
dumb. We pray because we believe. We exercise by faith the spirit of
adoption whereby we cry. He says not, I do cry, or I have cried, but I
will cry, and indeed, this resolution may stand with all of us until we
pass through the gates of pearl; for while we are here below we shall
still have need to cry. "Unto God most high" - Prayers are for God only;
the greatness and sublimity of his person and character suggest and
encourage prayer: however high our enemies, our heavenly Friend is
higher, for he is "Most high," and he can readily send from the height
of his power the succour which we need. "Unto God that performeth all
things for me." He has cogent reason for praying, for he sees God
performing The believer waits and God works. The Lord has undertaken for
us, and he will not draw back, he will go through with his covenant
engagements. Our translators have very properly inserted the words, "all
things," for there is a blank in the Hebrew, as if it were a carte
blanche, and you might write therein that the Lord would finish anything
and everything which he has begun. Whatsoever the Lord takes in hand he
will accomplish; hence past mercies are guarantees for the future, and
admirable reasons for continuing to cry unto him.

[Psa 57:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#003.md)

"He shall send from heaven." If there be no fit instruments on earth,
heaven shall yield up its legions of angels for the succour of the
saints. We may in times of great straits expect mercies of a remarkable
kind; like the Israelites in the wilderness, we shall have our bread hot
from heaven, new every morning; and for the overthrow of our enemies God
shall open his celestial batteries, and put them to utter confusion.
Wherever the battle is more fierce than ordinary, there shall come
succours from headquarters, for the Commander-in-chief sees all. "And
save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up." He will be
in time, not only to rescue his servants from being swallowed up, but
even from being reproached. Not only shall they escape the flames, but
not even the smell of fire shall pass upon them. O dog of hell, I am not
only delivered from thy bite, but even from thy bark. Our foes shall not
have the power to sneer at us, their cruel jests and taunting gibes
shall be ended by the message from heaven, which shall for ever save us.
"Selah." Such mercy may well make us pause to meditate and give thanks.
Rest, singer, for God has given thee rest! "God shall send forth his
mercy and his truth." He asked for mercy, and truth came with it. Thus
evermore doth God give us more than we ask or think. His attributes,
like angels on the wing, are ever ready to come to the rescue of his
chosen.

[Psa 57:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#004.md)

"My soul is among lions." He was a very Daniel. Howled at, hunted,
wounded, but not slain. His place was in itself one of extreme peril,
and yet faith made him feel himself secure, so that he could lie down.
The cave may have reminded him of a lion's den, and Saul and his band
shouting and yelling in their disappointment at missing him, were the
lions; yet beneath the divine shelter he felt himself safe. "And I lie
even among them that are set on fire." Perhaps Saul and his band kindled
a fire in the cavern while they halted in it, and David was thus
reminded of the fiercer fire of their hate which burned within their
hearts. Like the bush in Horeb, the believer is often in the midst of
flames, but never consumed. It is a mighty triumph of faith when we can
lie down even among firebrands and find rest, because God is our
defence. "Even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and
their tongue a sharp sword." Malicious men carry a whole armoury in
their mouths; they have not harmless mouths, whose teeth grind their own
food as in a mill, but their jaws are as mischievous as if every tooth
were a javelin or an arrow. They have no molars, all their teeth are
canine, and their nature is canine, leonine, wolfish, devilish. As for
that busy member the tongue, in the case of the malicious, it is a
two-edged, keen, cutting, killing sword. The tongue, which is here
compared to a sword, has the adjective sharp added to it, which is not
used in reference to the teeth, which are compared to spears, as if to
show that if men were actually to tear us with their teeth, like wild
beasts, they could not thereby wound us so severely as they can do with
their tongues. No weapon is so terrible as a tongue sharpened on the
devil's grindstone; yet even this we need not fear, for "No weapon that
is formed against thee shall prosper, and every tongue that riseth
against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn."

[Psa 57:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#005.md)

"Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens." This is the chorus of the
Psalm. Before he has quite concluded his prayer the good man interjects
a verse of praise; and glorious praise too, seeing it comes up from the
lion's den and from amid the coals of fire. Higher than the heavens is
the Most High, and so high ought our praises to rise. Above even the
power of cherubim and seraphim to express it, the glory of God is
revealed and is to be acknowledged by us. "Let thy glory be above all
the earth." As above, so below, let thy praises, O thou great Jehovah,
be universally proclaimed. As the air surrounds all nature, so let thy
praises gird the earth with a zone of song.

[Psa 57:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#006.md)

"They have prepared a net for my steps." The enemies of the godly spare
no pains, but go about their wicked work with the coolest deliberation.
As for each sort of fish, or bird, or beast, a fitting net is needed, so
do the ungodly suit their net to their victim's circumstances and
character with a careful craftiness of malice. Whatever David might do,
and whichever way he might turn, his enemies were ready to entrap him in
some way or other. "My soul is bowed down." He was held down like a bird
in a trap; his enemies took care to leave him no chance of comfort.
"They have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are
fallen themselves." He likens the designs of his persecutors to pits,
which were commonly dug by hunters to entrap their prey; these were made
in the usual path of the victim, and in this case David says, "before
me," i.e., in my ordinary way. He rejoices because these devices had
recoiled upon themselves. Saul hunted David, but David caught him more
than once and might have slain him on the spot. Evil is a stream which
one day flows back to its source. "Selah." We may sit down at the pit's
mouth and view with wonder the just retaliations of providence.

[Psalms 57:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 57:7</span></span>

7 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give
praise.

8 Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake
early.

9 I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people' I will sing unto thee
among the nations.

10 For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the
clouds.

11 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be above all
the earth.

[Psa 57:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#007.md)

"My heart is fixed." One would have thought he would have said, "My
heart is fluttered;" but no, he is calm, firm, happy, resolute,
established. When the central axle is secure, the whole wheel is right.
If our great bower anchor holds, the ship cannot drive. "O God, my heart
is fixed." I am resolved to trust thee, to serve thee, and to praise
thee. Twice does he declare this to the glory of God who thus comforts
the souls of his servants. Reader, it is surely well with thee, if thy
once roving heart is now firmly fixed upon God and the proclamation of
his glory. "I will sing and give praise." Vocally and instrumentally
will I celebrate thy worship. With lip and with heart will I ascribe
honour to thee. Satan shall not stop me, nor Saul, nor the Philistines.
I will make Adullam ring with music, and all the caverns thereof echo
with joyous song. Believer, make a firm decree that your soul in all
seasons shall magnify the Lord.

"Sing, though sense and carnal reason

Fain would stop the joyful song:

Sing, and count it highest treason

For a saint to hold his tongue."

[Psa 57:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#008.md)

"Awake up, my glory." Let the noblest powers of my nature bestir
them-selves: the intellect which conceives thought, the tongue which
expresses it, and the inspired imagination which beautifies it - let all
be on the alert now that the hour for praise has come. "Awake, Psaltery
and harp." Let all the music with which I am familiar be well attuned
for the hallowed service of praise. "I myself will awake early." I will
awake the dawn with my joyous notes. No sleepy verses and weary notes
shall be heard from; I will thoroughly arouse myself for this high
employ. When we are at our best we fall far short of the Lord's deserts,
let us, therefore, make sure that what we bring him is our best, and, if
marred with infirmity, at least let it not be deteriorated by indolence.
Three times the Psalmist calls upon himself to awake. Do we need so much
arousing, and for such work? Then let us not spare it, for the
engagement is too honourable, too needful to be left undone or ill done
for want of arousing ourselves.

[Psa 57:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#009.md)

"I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people." Gentiles shall hear my
praise. Here is an instance of the way in which the truly devout
evangelic spirit o'erleaps the boundaries which bigotry sets up. The
ordinary Jew would never wish the Gentile dogs to hear Jehovah's name,
except to tremble at it; but this grace-taught Psalmist has a missionary
spirit, and would spread the praise and fame of his God. "I will sing
unto thee among the nations." However far off they may be, I would make
them hear of thee through my glad Psalmody.

[Psa 57:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#010.md)

"For thy mercy is great unto the heavens." Right up from man's lowliness
to heaven's loftiness mercy reaches. Imagination fails to guess the
height of heaven, and even thus the riches of mercy exceed our highest
thoughts. The Psalmist, as he sits at the cave's mouth and looks up to
the firmament, rejoices that God's goodness is vaster and sublimer than
even the vaulted skies. "And thy truth unto the clouds." Upon the cloud
he sets the seal of his truth, the rainbow, which ratifies his covenant;
in the cloud he hides his rain and snow, which prove his truth by
bringing to us seedtime and harvest, cold and heat. Creation is great,
but the Creator greater far. Heaven cannot contain him; above clouds and
stars his goodness far exceeds.

[Psa 57:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#011.md)

"Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens." A grand chorus. Take it up,
ye angels and ye spirits made perfect, and join in it, ye sons of men
below, as ye say, "Let thy glory be above all the earth." The prophet in
the previous verse spoke of mercy "unto the heavens," but here his song
flies "above the heavens;" praise rises higher and higher, and knows no
bound.
