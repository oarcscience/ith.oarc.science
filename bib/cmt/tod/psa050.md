### [Psalms Chapter 50](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 50:0</span></span>

Title - A Psalm of Asaph - This is the first of the Psalms of Asaph, but
whether it was the production of that eminent musician, or merely
dedicated to him, we cannot tell. The titles of twelve Psalms bear his
name, but it could not in all of them be meant to ascribe their
authorship to him, for several of these Psalms are of too late a date to
have been composed by the same writer as the others. There was an Asaph
in David's time, who was one of David's chief musicians, and his family
appear to have continued long after in their hereditary office of temple
musicians. An Asaph is mentioned as a recorder or secretary in the days
of Hezekiah ([Kg2 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#018)), and another
was keeper of the royal forests under Artaxerxes. That Asaph did most
certainly write some of the Psalms is clear from [Ch2
29:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#030), where it is recorded that the
Levites were commanded to "sing praises unto the Lord with the words of
David, and of Asaph the seer," but that other Asaphic Psalms were not of
his composition, but were only committed to his care as a musician, is
equally certain from [Ch1 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#007), where
David is said to have delivered a Psalm into the hand of Asaph and his
brethren. It matters little to us whether he wrote or sang, for poet and
musician are near akin, and if one composes words and another sets them
to music, they rejoice together before the Lord.

Divisions - The Lord is represented as summoning the whole earth to hear
his declaration, [Psa 50:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#001); he then
declares the nature of the worship which he accepts, [Psa
50:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#007), accuses the ungodly of breaches
of the precepts of the second table, [Psa
50:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#016), and closes the court with a
word of threatening, [Psa 50:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#022), and a
direction of grace, [Psa 50:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#023).

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Whole Psalm

The exordium or beginning of this Psalm is the most grand and striking
that can possibly be imagined - the speaker God, the audience an
assembled world! We cannot compare or assimilate the scene here
presented to us with any human resemblance; nor do I imagine that earth
will ever behold such a day till that hour when the trumpet of the
archangel shall sound, and shall gather all the nations of the earth
from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other; when the dead,
small and great, shall stand before God, and the sea shall give up the
dead which are in it, and death and hell shall deliver up the dead that
are in them. - Barton Bouchier.

[Psa 50:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#001)

"El, Elohim, Jehovah has spoken!" So reads the Hebrew. - Andrew A.
Bonar.

[Psa 50:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#001) (first clause)

Some have observed that these three names, El, Elohim, Jehovah, here
mentioned, have three very distinct accents set to them, and which being
joined to a verb singular דּבּד, hath spoken, contains the mystery of
the trinity of Persons in the unity of the divine Essence. - John Gill.

[Psa 50:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#001)

"And called the earth," etc., i.e., all the inhabitants of the earth he
has commanded to come as witnesses and spectators of the judgment. -
Simon de Muis.

[Psa 50:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#001)

No more shall atheists mock his long delay;

His vengeance sleeps no more; behold the day!

Behold! - the Judge descends; his guards are nigh,

Tempests and fire attend him down the sky.

When God appears, all nature shall adore him.

While sinners tremble, saints rejoice before him.

Heaven, earth, and hell, draw near; let all things come,

To hear my justice, and the sinner's doom;

But gather first my saints (the Judge commands),

Bring them, ye angels, from their distant lands.

When Christ returns, wake every cheerful passion,

And shout, ye saints; he comes for your salvation.

Isaac Watts.

[Psa 50:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#002)

Out of Zion, the perfection of God's beauty hath shined; or, God has
caused the perfection of beauty to shine out of Zion. - Martin Geier.

[Psa 50:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#002)

"God hath shined." Like the sun in his strength, sometimes for the
comfort of his people, as [Psa 80:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#001);
sometimes for the terror of evil-doers, as [Psa
94:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#001), and here. But evermore God is
terrible out of his holy places. [Psa
68:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#035), and [Psa
89:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#007). - John Trapp.

[Psa 50:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#002)

"God hath shined." The proper meaning of יפע is to scatter rays from
afar, and from a lofty place, and to glitter. It is a word of a grand
sound, says Ch. Schultens, which is always used of a magnificent and
flashing light.... It is apparently used of the splendid symbol of God's
presence, as in [Deu 34:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#002), where he is
said to scatter beams from Mount Paran. From which it is manifest that
it may refer to the pillar of cloud and fire, the seat of the Divine
Majesty conspicuous on Mount Sinai, or on the tabernacle, or the
loftiest part of the temple. - Hermann Venema.

[Psa 50:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#003)

"Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence." He kept silence that
he might be judged, he will not keep silence when he begins to judge. It
would not have been said, "He shall come manifestly," unless at first he
had come concealed; nor, "He shall not keep silence," had he not at
first kept silence. How did he keep silence? Ask Isaiah: "He was brought
as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb,
so he openeth not his mouth." [Isa
53:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#007). But he shall come manifestly,
and shall not keep silence. How manifestly? "A fire shall go before him,
and round about him a mighty tempest." That tempest is to carry wholly
away the chaff from the floor which is now in threshing; that fire, to
consume what the tempest carries off. Now, however, he is silent; silent
in judgment, but not in precept. For if Christ is silent, what mean
these gospels? What the voices of the apostles? the canticles of the
Psalms? the lofty utterances of the prophets? Truly in all these Christ
is not silent. Howbeit he is silent for the present in not taking
vengeance, not in not warning. But he will come in surpassing brightness
to take vengeance, and will be seen of all, even of those who believe
not on him; but now, forasmuch as although present he was not concealed,
it behoved him to be despised: for unless he had been despised he would
not have been crucified; if not crucified he would not have shed his
blood, the price with which he redeemed us. But in order that he might
give a price for us, he was crucified; that he might be crucified, he
was despised; that he might be despised, he appeared in humble guise. -
Augustine.

[Psa 50:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#003) (first clause)

The future in the first clause may be rendered he is coming, as if the
sound of his voice and the light of his glory had preceded his actual
appearance. The imagery is borrowed from the giving of the law at Sinai.
- J. A. Alexander.

[Psa 50:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#003) (first clause)

May our God come! A prayer for the hastening of his advent, as in the
Apocalypse, [Rev 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#020). - Pool's
Synopsis.

[Psa 50:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#003)

"A fire shall devour before him." As he gave his law in fire, so in fire
shall he require it. - John Trapp.

[Psa 50:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#004)

"He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth." That these
dumb creatures may be as so many speaking evidences against an unworthy
people, and witnesses of God's righteous dealings against them. See [Deu
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#001); [Isa
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#002); [Mic
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#002). The Chaldee thus paraphraseth: He
will call the high angels from above; and the just of the earth from
beneath. - John Trapp.

[Psa 50:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#005)

"Gather," etc. To whom are these words addressed? Many suppose to the
angels, as the ministers of God's will; but it is unnecessary to make
the expression more definite than it is in the Psalm. - J. J. Stewart
Perowne.

[Psa 50:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#005)

"My saints," the objects of my mercy, those whom I have called and
specially distinguished. The term is here descriptive of a relation, not
of an intrinsic quality. - J. A. Alexander.

[Psa 50:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#005)

"Gather my saints together unto me." There is a double or two-fold
gathering to Christ. There is a gathering unto Christ by faith, a
gathering within the bond of the covenant., a gathering into the family
of God, a gathering unto the root of Jesse, standing up for an ensign of
the people. "In that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall
stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and
his rest shall be glorious." [Isa
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010). This is the main end of the
gospel, the great work of ministers, the gathering of sinners unto
Christ. But then there is a gathering unto Christ at the general
judgment; and this is the gathering that is here spoken of. This
gathering is consequential to the other. Christ will gather none to him
at the last day but those that are gathered to him by faith here; he
will give orders to gather together unto him all these, and none but
these, that have taken hold of his covenant.....

I would speak of Christ's owning and acknowledging the saints at his
second coming. His owning and acknowledging them is imported in his
giving these orders,"Gather my saints together unto me." .... Now upon
this head I mention the things following: - 1. Saintship will be the
only mark of distinction in that day. There are many marks of
distinction now; but these will all cease, and this only will remain. 2.
Saintship will then be Christ's badge of honour. Beware of mocking at
saintship, or sanctity, holiness, and purity; for it is Christ's badge
of honour, the garment with which his followers are clothed, and will be
the only badge of honour at the great day. 3. Christ will forget and
misken none of the saints. Many of the saints are forgotten here, it is
forgotten that such persons were in the world, but Christ will forget
and misken none of them at the great day; he will give forth a list of
all his saints, and give orders to gather them all unto him. 4. He will
confess, own, and acknowledge them before his Father, and his holy
angels. [Mat 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#032); [Luk
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#008); [Rev
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#005); They are to go to my Father's
house, and they are to go thither in my name, in my right, and at my
back; and so it is necessary I should own and acknowledge them before my
Father. But what need is there for his owning them before the angels?
Ans. They are to be the angels' companions, and so it is necessary he
should own them before the angels. This will be like a testimonial for
them unto the angels. Lastly. The evidences of his right to, and
propriety in them, will then be made to appear. [Mal
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#017) : "And they shall be mine, saith
the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels." It is too late
for persons to become his then; so the meaning is, they shall evidently
appear to be mine. - James Scot, 1773.

[Psa 50:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#005)

"Gather my saints together unto me." Our text may be considered as the
commission given by the great Judge to his angels - those ministering
spirits who do his will, hearkening to the voice of his power. The
language of the text is in accordance with that which was uttered by our
Lord when, alluding to the coming of the Son of Man, he says, "And he
shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall
gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to
the other." But previous to this final, this general gathering together
of his saints to judgment, Jehovah gathers them together in various
ways, in various places, and by various means, both of providence and of
grace. Previous to his being seated on a throne of judgment, we behold
him sitting on a throne of mercy, and we hear him saying, "Gather my
saints together unto me." These words lead us to notice - I. The
characters described, "My saints." II. The command issued, "Gather my
saints together unto me." I the characters here described - "My saints."
By the term "my saints," we are to understand my holy ones - those who
have been sanctified and set apart by God. None of us possess this
character by nature. We are born sinners, and there is no difference;
but by divine grace we experience a change of nature, and consequently a
change of name. The title of saint is frequently given to the people of
God in derision. "Such an one," says a man of the world, "is one of your
saints." But, my brethren, no higher honour can be conferred upon us
than to be denominated saints, if we truly deserve that character; but
in what way do we become saints? We become saints - 1. By divine choice.
The saints are the objects of everlasting love; their names are written
in the Lamb's book of life; and it is worthy of remark that wherever the
people of God are spoken of in sacred Scripture, as the objects of that
everlasting love, it is in connection with their personal
sanctification. Observe, they are not chosen because they are saints,
nor because it is foreseen that they will be so, but they are chosen to
be saints; sanctification is the effect and the only evidence of
election. We become saints - 2. By a divine change which is the
necessary consequence of this election. An inward, spiritual,
supernatural, universal change is effected in the saints by the power of
the Holy Ghost. Thus they are renewed in the spirit of their minds, and
made partakers of a divine nature.....Remember, then, this important
truth, that Christians are called by the gospel to be saints; that you
are Christians, not so much by your orthodoxy as by your holiness; that
you are saints no further than as you are holy in all manner of
conversation. 3. The people of God furnish an evidence of being saints
by their godly conduct. "By their fruits," not by their feelings; not by
their lips, not by their general profession, but, "by their fruits shall
ye know them." 4. The character of the saints is evidenced by divine
consecration. The people of God are called holy inasmuch as they are
dedicated to God. It is the duty and the privilege of saints to
consecrate themselves to the service of God. Even a heathen philosopher
could say, "I lend myself to the world, but I give myself to the gods."
But we possess more light and knowledge, and are therefore laid under
greater obligations than was Seneca.

II\. The command issued - "Gather my saints together unto me." Jehovah
gathers his saints to himself in various ways. 1. He gathers them to
himself in their conversion. The commission given by Christ to his
ministers is, "Go ye forth into all the world, and preach the gospel to
every creature," or in other words, "Gather my saints together unto me."
The gospel is to be preached to sinners in order that they may become
saints. 2. Saints are gathered together by God in public worship.... 3.
He gathers his saints together to himself in times of danger. When
storms appear to be gathering around them, he is desirous to screen them
from the blast. He says to them, in the language of Isaiah, "Come, my
people, and enter into thy chamber - the chamber of my perfections and
my promises - enter into thy chamber and shut the doors about thee, and
hide thyself until the calamity is overpast." 4. God gathers his saints
together in the service of his church. Thus Christ collected his
apostles together to give them their apostolic commission to go and
teach all nations. At the period of the Reformation, the great Head of
the church raised up Luther and Calvin, together with other eminent
reformers, in order that they might light up a flame in Europe, yea,
throughout the world, that the breath of popery should never be able to
blow out. 5. God gathers his saints together in death, and at the
resurrection. "Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his
saints." This is the commission which death is habitually receiving -
"Go, death, and gather such-and-such of my saints unto me." As the
gardener enters the garden, and plucks the full-blown flower and the
ripened fruit, so Jesus Christ enters the garden of his church and
gathers his saints to himself; for he says, "Father, I will that all
they whom thou hast given me may be with me, where I am, and behold my
glory." - Condensed from J. Sibree's "Sermon preached at the reopening
of Surrey Chapel, August 29th, 1830."

[Psa 50:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#005) (second clause)

"Made," or ratifying a covenant; literally, cutting, striking, perhaps
in allusion to the practice of slaying and dividing victims as a
religious rite, accompanying solemn compacts. (See [Gen
15:10-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#010)). The same usage may be
referred to in the following words, over sacrifice, i.e., standing over
it; or, on sacrifice, i.e., founding the engagement on a previous appeal
to God. There is probably allusion to the great covenant transaction
recorded in [Exo 24:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#004). This
reference to sacrifice shows clearly that what follows was not intended
to discredit or repudiate that essential symbol of the typical or
ceremonial system. - J. A. Alexander.

[Psa 50:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#005)

"Made a covenant with me." Formerly soldiers used to take an oath not to
flinch from their colours, but faithfully to cleave to their leaders;
this they called sacramentum militate, a military oath; such an oath
lies upon every Christian. It is so essential to the being of a saint,
that they are described by this, "Gather my saints together unto me;
those that have made a covenant with me." We are not Christians till we
have subscribed this covenant, and that without any reservation. When we
take upon us the profession of Christ's name, we enlist ourselves in his
muster-roll, and by it do promise that we will live and die with him in
opposition to all his enemies.... He will not entertain us till we
resign up ourselves freely to his disposal, that there may be no
disputing with his commands afterwards, but, as one under his authority,
go and come at his word. - William Gurnall.

[Psa 50:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#006)

"The heavens shall declare his righteousness." It is the manner of
Scripture to commit the teaching of that which it desires should be most
noticeable, and important to the heavens and the earth for the heavens
are seen by all, and their light discovers all things. Here it speaks of
the heavens, not the earth, because these are everlasting, but not the
earth. - Geier and Muis in Pool's Synopsis.

[Psa 50:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#008)

"I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices;" i.e., for thy neglect of
them, but for thy resting in them, sticking in the bark, bringing me the
bare shell without the kernel, not referring to the right end and use,
but satisfying thyself in the work done. - John Trapp.

[Psa 50:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#008)

"I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings
continually before me." Those words "to have been," which our
translators supply, may be left out, and the sense remain perfect or if
those words be continued, then the negative particle not, is to be
reassumed out of the first part of the verse, and the whole read thus,
"I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings not
to have been continually before me." That is, I will not charge thee
with a neglect of outward duty or worship, the inward or spiritual (of
which he speaks, ver. 14), being that which is most pleasing unto me. -
Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 50:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#008), [Psa
50:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#009)

It is the very remonstrance which our Lord himself makes against the
Pharisees of his days, for laying so much stress on the outward
observance of their own traditions, the washing of pots and cups and
other such like things; the paying of tithes of anise and mint and
cummin; the ostentatious fulfilment of all ceremonious observances in
the eyes of men, the exalting the shadow to the exclusion of the
substance. And have we not seen the like in our own days, even to the
very vestment of the minister, the obeisance of the knee, and the
posture of the body? as if the material church were all in all, and God
were no Spirit, that demanded of those that worshipped him that they
should worship him in spirit and in truth; as if the gold and ornaments
of the temple were far beyond the hidden man of the heart in that which
is incorruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is
in the sight of God of great price. - Barton Bouchier.

[Psa 50:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#010)

"For to me \[belongs\] every beast of the forest, the cattle in hills of
a thousand." This last idiomatic phrase may either mean a thousand
hills, or hills where the cattle rove by thousands, with probable
allusion to the hilly grounds of Bashan beyond Jordan. According to
etymology, the noun in the first clause means an animal, and that in the
second beasts or brutes in general. But when placed in antithesis, the
first denotes a wild beast, and the second domesticated animals or
cattle. Both words were necessary to express God's sovereign propriety
in the whole animal creation. Thus understood, the verse assigns a
reason for the negative assertion in the one before it. Even if God
could stand in need of animal oblations, for his own sake, or for their
sake, he would not be under the necessity of coming to man for them,
since the whole animal creation is his property and perfectly at his
disposal. - J. A. Alexander.

[Psa 50:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#011), [Psa
50:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#012)

We show our scorn of God's sufficiency, by secret thoughts of meriting
from him by any religious act, as though God could be indebted to us,
and obliged by us. As though our devotions could bring a blessedness to
God more than he essentially hath; when indeed "our goodness extends not
to him." [Psa 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002). Our services to
God are rather services to ourselves, and bring a happiness to us, not
to God. This secret opinion of merit (though disputed among the Papists,
yet) is natural to man; and this secret self-pleasing, when we have
performed any duty, and upon that account expect some fair compensation
from God, as having been profitable to him; God intimates this: "The
wild beasts of the field are mine. If I were hungry, I would not tell
thee: for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof." He implies, that
they wronged his infinite fulness, by thinking that he stood in need of
their sacrifices and services, and that he was beholden to them for
their adoration of him. All merit implies a moral or natural
insufficiency in the person of whom we merit, and our doing something
for him, which he could not, or at least so well do for himself. It is
implied in our murmuring at God's dealing with us as a course of cross
providences, wherein men think they have deserved better at the hands of
God by their service, than to be cast aside and degraded by him. In our
prosperity we are apt to have secret thoughts that our enjoyments were
the debts God owed us, rather than gifts freely bestowed upon us. Hence
it is that men are more unwilling to part with their righteousness than
with their sins, and are apt to challenge salvation as a due, rather
than beg it as an act of grace. - Stephen Charnock.

[Psa 50:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#012)

"If I were hungry," etc. Pagan sacrifices were considered as feasts of
the gods. - Daniel Cresswell.

[Psa 50:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#013)

"Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?" That is,
did I want anything I would not tell thee; but hast thou indeed such
gross notions of men, as to imagine that I have appointed and required
the blood and flesh of animals for their own sake and not with some
design? Dost thou think I am pleased with these, when they are offered
without faith, love, and gratitude? Nay, offer the sacrifice of praise,
etc. Render to me a spiritual and reasonable service, performing thy
engagements, and then thou wilt find me a very present help in trouble.
- B. Boothroyd.

[Psa 50:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#015)

"Call upon me," etc. Prayer is like the ring which Queen Elizabeth gave
to the Earl of Essex, bidding him if he were in any distress send that
ring to her, and she would help him. God commandeth his people if they
be in any perplexity to send this ring to him: "Call upon me in the day
of trouble: I will deliver thee," and thou shalt glorify me." - George
Swinnock.

[Psa 50:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#015)

"Call upon me in the day of trouble," etc. Who will scrape to a keeper
for a piece of venison who may have free access to the master of the
game to ask and have? Hanker not after other helpers, rely on him only,
fully trusting him in the use of such means as he prescribeth and
affordeth. God is jealous, will have no co-rival, nor allow thee (in
this case) two strings to thy bow. He who worketh all in all must be
unto thee all in all: of, through, and to whom are all things, to him be
all praise for ever. [Rom 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#036). -
George Gipps, in "A Sermon preached (before God, and from him) to the
Honourable House of Commons, 1645."

[Psa 50:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#015)

"Call upon me in the day of trouble," etc. The Lord hath promised his
children supply of all good things, yet they must see the means of
impetration; by prayer. He feeds the young ravens when they call upon
him. [Psa 147:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#009). He feeds the young
ravens, but first they call upon him. God withholds from them that ask
not, lest he should give to them that desire not. (Augustine.) David was
confident that by God's power he should spring over a wall; yet not
without putting his own strength and agility to it. Those things we pray
for, we must work for. (Augustine.) The carter in Isidore, when his cart
was overthrown, would needs have his god Hercules come down from heaven,
to help him up with it; but whilst he forbore to set his own shoulder to
it, his cart lay still. Abraham was as rich as any of our aldermen,
David as valiant as any of our gentlemen, Solomon as wise as any of our
deepest naturians, Susanna as fair as any of our painted pieces. Yet
none of them thought that their riches, valour, policy, beauty, or
excellent parts could save them; but they stirred the sparks of grace,
and bestirred themselves in pious work. And this is our means, if our
meaning be to be saved. - Thomas Adams.

[Psa 50:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#015)

"I will deliver thee:" properly, I will draw thee forth with my own
mighty hand," and plant thee in liberty and prosperity. - Hermann
Venema.

[Psa 50:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#016)

"Unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my
statutes?" etc. "As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is
not seemly for a fool." Is it not? No wonder then that divine wisdom
requires us ourselves to put off the old man (as snakes put off their
skins) before we take on us the most honourable office of reproving sin;
a duty which above any other brings praise to God, and profit to men;
insomuch that God hath not a more honourable work that I know of to set
us about. And what think you? Are greasy scullions fit to stand before
kings? Are dirty kennel-rakers fit to be plenipotentiaries or
ambassadors? Are unclean beasts fit to be made lord-almoners, and sent
to bestow the king's favours? Are swine fit to cast pearl, and the very
richest pearl of God's royal word? No man dreams it; consequently none
can believe himself qualified or commissioned to be a reprover of sin
"till he is washed, till he is sanctified, till he is justified in the
name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the Spirit of our God." A lunatick
beggar in Athens would not believe but that all the ships in the harbour
were his. His mistake exceeded not theirs, who persuade themselves that
this richer office is theirs, before they are "alive from the dead," and
"born of the Spirit," before they are returned to God or to themselves.
The Duke of Alva is said to have complained that, "his king sent him in
fetters to fight for him;" because without his pardon given him, and
while he was a prisoner, he employed him in war. But the supreme King is
a more merciful one, and orders our charity to begin at home; making it
our first duty to break off our sins; and then when we have put off
these our shackles, go to fight his battles. - Daniel Burgess
(1645-1712-13) in "The Golden Snuffers."

[Psa 50:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#016)

"The wicked." By whom are meant, not openly profane sinners; but men
under a profession of religion, and indeed who were teachers of others,
as appears from the following expostulations with them: the Scribes,
Pharisees, and doctors among the Jews, are designed, and so Kimchi
interprets it of their wise men, who learnt and taught the law, but did
not act according to it. - John Gill.

[Psa 50:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#016)

"What hast thou to do to declare my statutes?" etc. All the medival
writers teach us, even from the Mosaic law concerning the leper, how the
writer of this Psalm only put into words what those statutes expressed
in fact. For so it is written: "The leper in whom the plague is,... he
shall put a covering upon his upper lip." As they all, following Origen,
say: Let them who are themselves of polluted lips, take good heed not to
teach others. Or, to take it in the opposite way, see how Isaiah would
not speak to his people, because he was a man of polluted lips, and he
dwelt among a people of polluted lips, till they had been touched with
the living coal from the altar; and by that, as by a sacrament of the
Old Testament, a sentence of absolution had been pronounced upon them. -
J. M. Neale.

[Psa 50:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#016) (second clause)

Emphasis is laid on the phrase, to declare God's statutes, which both
denotes such an accurate knowledge of them as one may obtain by
numbering them, and a diligent and public review of them. Properly
speaking the word is derived from the Arabic, and signifies to reckon in
dust, for the ancients were accustomed to calculate in dust finely
sprinkled over tablets or the Abacus. - Hermann Venema.

[Psa 50:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#016)

"But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do... to take my
covenant into thy mouth?" For whom is the covenant made but for the
wicked? If men were not wicked or sinful, what needed there a covenant
of grace? The covenant is for the wicked, and the covenant brings grace
enough to pardon those who are most wicked; why, then, doth the Lord say
to the wicked, "What hast thou to do to take my covenant into thy
mouth?" Observe what follows, and his meaning is expounded: "Seeing thou
hatest to be reformed." As if God had said, Thou wicked man, who
protectest thy sin, and holdest it close, refusing to return and hating
to reform; what hast thou to do to meddle with my covenant? Lay off thy
defiled hands. He that is resolved to hold his sin takes hold of the
covenant in vain, or rather he lets it go, while he seems to hold it.
Woe unto those who sue for mercy while they neglect duty. - Joseph
Caryl.

[Psa 50:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#016)

When a minister does not do what he teaches, this makes him a vile
person; nay, this makes him ridiculous, like Lucian's apothecary, who
had medicines in his shop to cure the cough, and told others that he had
them, and yet was troubled with it himself. With what a forehead canst
thou stand in a pulpit and publish the laws of God, and undertake the
charge of souls, that when thine own nakedness appears, when thy tongue
is of a larger size than thy hands, thy ministry is divided against
itself, thy courses give thy doctrine the lie; thou sayest that men must
be holy, and thy deeds do declare thy mouth's hypocrisy; thou doest more
mischief than a hundred others. - William Fenner.

[Psa 50:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#017)

"And castest my words behind thee." Thou castest away contemptuously
with disgust and detestation, as idols are cast out of a city; or as
Moses indignantly dashed to the earth the tables of the law. - Martin
Geier.

[Psa 50:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#017)

"My words:" apparently the ten commandments, accustomed to be called the
ten words, by which God is often said to have made his covenant with
Israel. - Hermann Venema.

[Psa 50:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#018)

"When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him;" or didst run
with him. This was literally true of the Scribes and Pharisees; they
devoured widows' houses, and robbed them of their substance, under a
pretext of long prayers; they consented to the deeds of Barabbas, a
robber, when they preferred him to Jesus Christ; and they joined with
the thieves on the cross in reviling him; and, in a spiritual sense,
they stole away the word of the Lord, every man from his neighbour; took
away the key of knowledge from the people, and put false glosses upon
the sacred writings. - John Gill.

[Psa 50:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#018)

"Thou consentedst with him;" became his accomplice. Συνέτρεχες αὐτῷ,
lxx, i.e., you helped him to carry off his booty and to make his escape.
- Samuel Horsley.

[Psa 50:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#018)

"Thou consentedst with him." Or, thou runnest along with him. "Hast been
partaker with;" namely, thou art his companion; a term taken from
commerce of merchants, or from banquets made after the ancient manner,
to which divers did contribute, and had their shares therein. - John
Diodati.

[Psa 50:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#018) (last clause)

To give entertainment to them we know to be dissolute, is to communicate
with their sins. - Thomas Adams.

[Psa 50:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#019)

"Thou givest thy mouth to evil," etc. "Thou givest." Heb., thou sendest
forth; to wit, free; for the word is used of men's dismissing their
wives or their servants, whom they left to their freedom. Thou hast an
unbridled tongue, and castest off all restraints of God's law, and of
thine own conscience, and givest thy tongue liberty to speak what thou
pleasest, though it be offensive and dishonourable to God, and injurious
to thy neighbour, or to thy own soul; which is justly produced as an
evidence of their hypocrisy. "To evil," either to sinful or mischievous
speeches. "Frameth deceit," i.e., uttereth lies or fair words, wherewith
to circumvent those who deal with them. - Matthew Pool.

[Psa 50:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#019)

The ninth commandment is now added to the other two, as being habitually
violated by the person here addressed. - J. A. Alexander.

[Psa 50:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#020)

"Thou sittest and speakest," etc. A man may both speak and do evil while
he sits still and doth nothing; an idle posture may serve the turn for
such work as that. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 50:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#020)

"Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother," etc. When you are
sitting still, and have nothing else to do, you are ever injuring your
neighbour with your slanderous speech. Your table-talk is abuse of your
nearest friends. - Samuel Horsley.

[Psa 50:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#020)

"Thine own mother's son." To understand the force of this expression, it
is necessary to bear in mind that polygamy was allowed amongst the
Israelites. Those who were born to the same father were all brethren,
but a yet more intimate relationship subsisted between those who had the
same mother as well as the same father. - French and Skinner.

[Psa 50:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#021)

"These things hast thou done, and I kept silence." Neither sleep nor
slumber, nor connivance, nor neglect of anything can be incident to God.
Because he doth not execute present judgment and visible destruction
upon sinners, therefore blasphemy presumptuously inferreth - will God
trouble himself about such petty matters? So they imagined of their
imaginary Jupiter. Non vacat exiguis rebus adesse Joven. What a narrow
and finite apprehension this is of God! He that causeth and produceth
every action - shall he not be present at every action? What can we do
without him, that cannot move but in him? He that takes notice of
sparrows, and numbers the seeds which the very ploughman thrusts in the
ground, can any action of man escape his knowledge, or slip from his
contemplation? He may seem to wink at things, but never shuts his eyes.
He doth not always manifest a reprehensive knowledge, yet he always
retains an apprehensive knowledge. Though David smote not Shimei
cursing, yet he heard Shimei cursing. As judges often determine to hear,
but do not hear to determine; so though God does not see to like, yet he
likes to see. - Thomas Adams.

[Psa 50:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#021)

"Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself." Such is
the blindness and corruption of our nature, that we have very deformed
and misshapen thoughts of him, till with the eye of faith we see his
face in the glass of the word; and therefore Mr. Perkins affirms, that
all men who ever came of Adam (Christ alone excepted) are by nature
atheists; because at the same time that they acknowledge God, they deny
his power, presence, and justice, and allow him to be only what pleaseth
themselves. Indeed, it is natural for every man to desire to accommodate
his lusts with such conception of God as may be most favourable to and
suit best with them. God charges some for this: "Thou thoughtest that I
was altogether such an one as thyself." Sinners do with God as the
Ethiopians do with angels, whom they picture with black faces that they
may be like themselves. - William Gurnall.

[Psa 50:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#021)

"Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself." This men
do when they plead for sins as little, as venial, as that which is below
God to take notice of; because they themselves think it so, therefore
God must think it so too. Men, with a giant-like pride, would climb into
the throne of the Almighty, and establish a contradiction to the will of
God by making his own will, and not God's, the square and rule of his
actions. This principle commenced, and took date in Paradise, when Adam
would not depend upon the will of God revealed to him, but upon himself
and his own will, and thereby makes himself as God. - Stephen Charnock.

[Psa 50:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#021)

"1 will set them in order before thine eyes." This is to be understood
more militari, when sins shall be set in rank and file, in bloody array
against thy soul; or more forensi, when they shall be set in order as so
many indictments for thy rebellion and treason. - Stephen Charnock.

[Psa 50:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#021)

"And set them in order before thine eyes:" as if he should say, Thou
thoughtest all thy sins were scattered and dispersed; that there was not
a sin to be found; that they should never be rallied and brought
together; but I assure thee I will make an army of those sins, a
complete army of them, I will set them in rank and file before thine
eyes; and see how thou canst behold, much less contend with, such an
host as they. Take heed therefore you do not levy war against your own
souls; that's the worst of all civil or intestine wars. If any army of
divine terrors be so fearful, what will an army of black, hellish sins
be? when God shall bring whole regiments of sins against you - here a
regiment of oaths, there a regiment of lies, there a third of false
dealings, here a troop of filthy actions, ad there a legion of unclean
or profane thoughts, all at once fighting against thy life and
everlasting peace. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 50:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#021)

Atheists do mock at those Scriptures which tell us that we shall give
account of all our deeds; but God shall make them find the truth of it
in that day of their reckoning. It is as easy for him to make their
forgetful minds remember as to create the minds in them. When he
applieth his register to their forgetful spirits they shall see all
their forgotten sins. When the printer presseth clean paper upon his
oiled irons, it receiveth the print of every letter: so when God shall
stamp their minds with his register, they shall see all their former
sins in a 'view. The hand was ever writing against Belshazzar, as he was
ever sinning, though he saw it not till the cup was filled: so is it to
the wicked; their sins are numbered, and themselves weighed, and see not
till they be divided by a fearful wakening. - William Struther.

[Psa 50:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#021) (last clause)

"God setteth his sins in order before his eyes." Imprimis, the sin of
his conception. Item, the sins of his childhood. Item, of his youth.
Item, of his man's estate, etc. Or, Imprimis, sins against the first
table. Item, sins against the second; so many of ignorance, so many of
knowledge, so many of presumption, severally sorted by themselves. He
committed sins confusedly, huddling them up in heaps; but God sets them
in order, and methodizes them to his hands. - Thomas Fuller.

[Psa 50:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#022)

"Now consider this, ye that forget God," etc. What is less than a grain
of sand? Yet when it comes to be multiplied, what is heavier than the
sands of the sea? A little sum multiplied rises high; so a little sin
unrepented of will damn us, as one leak in the ship, if it be not well
looked to, will drown us. "Little sins," as the world calls them, but
great sins against the majesty of God Almighty, whose majesty, against
which they are committed, doth accent and enhance them, if not repented
of, will damn. One would think it no great matter to forget God, yet it
has a heavy doom attending on it. The non-improvement of talents, the
non-exercise of grace, the world looks upon as a small thing; yet we
read of him who hid his talent in the earth - he had not spent it, only
not trading it is sentenced. - Thomas Watson.

[Psa 50:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#022)

"Lest I tear you in pieces." This is a metaphorical expression, taken
from the strength and irresistible fury of a lion, from which the
interference of the shepherd can supply no protection, or defence, for
his flock. - William Walford.

[Psa 50:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#023)

"Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me." Thanksgiving is a God-exalting
work. Though nothing can add the least cubit to God's essential glory,
yet praise exalts him in the eyes of others. Praise is a setting forth
of God's honour, a lifting up of his name, a displaying the trophy of
his goodness, a proclaiming his excellency, a spreading his renown, a
breaking open the box of ointment, whereby the sweet savour and perfume
of God's name is sent abroad into the world. "To him that ordereth his
conversation aright." Though the main work of religion lies within, yet
"our light must so shine," that others may behold it: the foundation of
sincerity is in the heart, yet its beautiful frontispiece appears in the
conversation. The saints are called "jewels," because they cast a
sparkling lustre in the eyes of others. An upright Christian is like
Solomon's temple, gold within and without: sincerity is a holy leaven,
which if it be in the heart will work itself into the life, and make it
swell and rise as high as heaven. [Phi
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020). - Thomas Watson.

[Psalms 50:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 50:1</span></span>

1 The mighty God, even the Lord, hath spoken, and called the earth from
the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.

2 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.

3 Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour
before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.

4 He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may
judge his people.

5 Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant
with me by sacrifice.

6 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness for God is judge
himself. Selah.

[Psa 50:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#001)

"The mighty God, even the Lord" - El, Elohim, Jehovah, three glorious
names for the God of Israel. To render the address the more impressive,
these august titles are mentioned, just as in royal decrees the names
and dignities of monarchs are placed in the forefront. Here the true God
is described as Almighty, as the only and perfect object of adoration
and as the self-existent One, "Hath spoken, and called the earth from
the rising of the sun until the going down thereof." The dominion of
Jehovah extends over the whole earth, and therefore to all mankind is
his decree directed. The east and the west are bidden to hear the God
who makes his sun to rise on every quarter of the globe. Shall the
summons of the great King be despised? Will we dare provoke him to anger
by slighting his call?

[Psa 50:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#002)

"Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined." The Lord is
represented not only as speaking to the earth, but as coming forth to
reveal the glory of his presence to an assembled universe. God of old
dwelt in Zion among his chosen people, but here the beams of his
splendour are described as shining forth upon all nations. The sun was
spoken of in the first verse, but here is a far brighter sun. The
majesty of God is most conspicuous among his own elect, but it is not
confined to them; the church is not a dark lantern, but a candlestick.
God shines not only in Zion, but out of her. She is made perfect in
beauty by his indwelling and that beauty is seen by all observers when
the Lord shines forth from her.

Observe how with trumpet voice and flaming ensign the infinite Jehovah
summons the heavens and the earth to hearken to his word.

[Psa 50:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#003)

"Our God shall come." The Psalmist speaks of himself and his brethren as
standing in immediate anticipation of the appearing of the Lord upon the
scene. "He comes," they say, "our covenant God is coming;" they can hear
his voice from afar, and perceive the splendour of his attending train.
Even thus should we wait the long-promised appearing of the Lord from
heaven. "And shall not keep silence." He comes to speak, to plead with
his people, to accuse and judge the ungodly. He has been silent long in
patience, but soon he will speak with power. What a moment of awe when
the Omnipotent is expected to reveal himself! What will be the reverent
joy and solemn expectation when the poetic scene of this Psalm becomes
in the last great day an actual reality! "A fire shall devour before
him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him." Flame and
hurricane are frequently described as the attendants of the divine
appearance. "Our God is a consuming fire." "At the brightness that was
before him his thick clouds passed, hailstones and coals of fire." [Psa
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#012). "He rode upon a cherub, and did
fly; yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind." "The Lord Jesus shall
be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire taking
vengeance on them that know not God." [Th2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#007), [Th2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#008). Fire is the emblem of justice in
action, and the tempest is a token of his overwhelming power. Who will
not listen in solemn silence when such is the tribunal from which the
judge pleads with heaven and earth?

[Psa 50:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#004)

"He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth." Angels and
men, the upper and the lower worlds, are called to witness the solemn
scene. The whole creation shall stand in court to testify to the
solemnity and the truth of the divine pleading. Both earth beneath and
heaven above shall unite in condemning sin; the guilty shall have no
appeal, though all are summoned that they may appeal if they dare. Both
angels and men have seen the guilt of mankind and the goodness of the
Lord, they shall therefore confess the justice of the divine utterance,
and say "Amen" to the sentence of the supreme Judge. Alas, ye despisers!
What will ye do and to whom will ye fly? "That he may judge his people."
Judgment begins at the house of God. The trial of the visible people of
God will be a most awful ceremonial. He will thoroughly purge his floor.
He will discern between his nominal and his real people, and that in
open court, the whole universe looking on. My soul, when this actually
takes place, how will it fare with thee? Canst thou endure the day of
his coming?

[Psa 50:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#005)

"Gather my saints together unto me." Go, ye swift-winged messengers, and
separate the precious from the vile. Gather out the wheat of the
heavenly garner. Let the long-scattered, but elect people known by my
separating grace to be my sanctified ones, be now assembled in one
place. All are not saints who seem to be so: a severance must be made;
therefore let all who profess to be saints be gathered before my throne
of judgment, and let them hear the word which will search and try the
whole, that the false may be convicted and the true revealed. "Those
that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice;" this is the grand test,
and yet some have dared to imitate it. The covenant was ratified by the
slaying of victims, the cutting and dividing of offerings; this the
righteous have done by accepting with true faith the great propitiatory
sacrifice, and this the pretenders have done in merely outward form. Let
them be gathered before the throne for trial, and testing, and as many
as have really ratified the covenant by faith in the Lord Jesus shall be
attested before all worlds as the objects of distinguishing grace while
formalists shall learn that outward sacrifices are all in vain. Oh,
solemn assize, how does my soul bow in awe at the prospect thereof!

[Psa 50:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#006)

"And the heavens shall declare his righteousness." Celestial
intelligences and the spirits of just men made perfect, shall magnify
the infalliable judgment of the divine tribunal. Now they doubtless
wonder at the hypocrisy of men; then they shall equally marvel at the
exactness of the severance between the true and the false. "For God is
judge himself." This is the reason for the correctness of the judgment.
Priests of old, and churches of later times, were readily deceived, but
not so the all-discerning Lord. No deputy-judge sits on the great white
throne; the injured Lord of all himself weighs the evidence and allots
the vengeance or reward. The scene in the Psalm is a grand poetical
conception but it is also an inspired prophecy of that day which shall
burn as an oven, when the Lord shall discern between him that feareth
him and him that feareth him not. "Selah." Here we may well pause in
reverent prostration, in deep searching of heart, in humble prayer and
in awe-struck expectation.

[Psalms 50:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 50:7</span></span>

7 Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify
against thee: I am God, even thy God.

8 I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings, to
have been continually before me.

9 I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of thy
folds.

10 For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand
hills.

11 I know all the fowls of the mountains and the wild beasts of the
field are mine.

12 If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is mine, and
the fulness thereof.

13 Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?

14 Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High:

15 And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou
shalt glorify me.

The address which follows is directed to the professed people of God. It
is clearly, in the first place, meant for Israel; but is equally
applicable to the visible church of God in every age. It declares the
futility of external worship when spiritual faith is absent and the mere
outward ceremonial is rested in.

[Psa 50:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#007)

"Hear, O my people, and I will speak." Because Jehovah speaks, and they
are avowedly his own people, they are bound to give earnest heed. "Let
me speak," saith the great I am. The heavens and earth are but
listeners, the Lord is about both to testify and to judge. "O Israel,
and I will testify against thee." Their covenant name is mentioned to
give point to the address; it was a double evil that the chosen nation
should become so carnal, so unspiritual, so false, so heartless to their
God. God himself, whose eyes sleep not, who is not misled by rumour, but
sees for himself, enters on the scene as witness against his favoured
nation. Alas! for us when God, even our fathers' God, testifies to the
hypocrisy of the visible church. "I am God, even thy God." He had taken
them to be his peculiar people above all other nations, and they had in
the most solemn manner avowed that he was their God. Hence the special
reason for calling them to account. The law began with, "I am the Lord
thy God, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt," and now the
session of their judgment opens with the same reminder of their singular
position, privilege, and responsibility. It is not only that Jehovah is
God, but thy God, O Israel; this it is that makes thee so amenable to
his searching reproofs.

[Psa 50:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#008)

"I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifice or thy burnt offerings, to
have been ever before me." Though they had not failed in maintaining his
outward worship, or even if they had, he was not about to call them to
account for this: a more weighty matter was now under consideration.
They thought the daily sacrifices and the abounding burnt offerings to
be everything: he counted them nothing if the inner sacrifice of heart
devotion had been neglected. What was greatest with them was least with
God. It is even so today. Sacraments (so called) and sacred rites are
the main concern with unconverted but religious men, but with the Most
High the spiritual worship which they forget is the sole matter. Let the
external be maintained by all means according to the divine command, but
if the secret and spiritual be not in them, they are a vain oblation, a
dead ritual, and even an abomination before the Lord.

[Psa 50:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#009)

"I will take no bullock out of thy house." Foolishly they dreamed that
bullocks with horns and hoofs could please the Lord, when indeed he
sought for hearts and souls. Impiously they fancied that Jehovah needed
these supplies, and that if they fed his altar with their fat beasts, he
would be content. What he intended for their instruction, they made
their confidence. They remembered not that "to obey is better than
sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams." "Nor he goats out of thy
folds." He mentions these lesser victims as if to rouse their common
sense to see that the great Creator could find no satisfaction in mere
animal offerings. If he needed these, he would not appeal to their
scanty stalls and folds; in fact, he here refuses to take so much as
one, if they brought them under the false and dishonouring view, that
they were in themselves pleasing to him. This shows that the sacrifices
of the law were symbolical of higher and spiritual things, and were not
pleasing to God except under their typical aspect. The believing
worshipper looking beyond the outward was accepted, the unspiritual who
had no respect to their meaning was wasting his substance, and
blaspheming the God of heaven.

[Psa 50:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#010)

"For every beast of the forest is mine." How could they imagine that the
Most High God, possessor of heaven and earth, had need of beasts, when
all the countless hordes that find shelter in a thousand forests and
wildernesses belong to him? "And the cattle upon a thousand hills." Not
alone the wild beasts, but also the tamer creatures are all his own.
Even if God cared for these things, he could supply himself. Their
cattle were not, after all, their own, but were still the great
Creator's property, why then should he be beholden to them. From Dan to
Beersheba, from Nebaioth to Lebanon, there fed not a beast which was not
marked with the name of the great Shepherd; why, then, should he crave
oblations of Israel? What a slight is here put even upon sacrifices of
divine appointment when wrongly viewed as in themselves pleasing to God!
And all this to be so expressly stated under the law! How much more is
this clear under the gospel, when it is so much more plainly revealed,
that "God is a Spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in
spirit and in truth"? Ye Ritualists, ye Sacramentarians, ye modern
Pharisees, what say ye to this?

[Psa 50:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#011)

"I know all the fowls of the mountains." All the winged creatures are
under my inspection and near my hand; what then can be the value of your
pairs of turtledoves and your two young pigeons? The great Lord not only
feeds all his creatures, but is well acquainted with each one; how
wondrous is this knowledge! "And the wild beasts of the field are mine."
The whole population moving over the plain belongs to me; why then
should I seek your beeves and rams? In me all things live and move; how
mad are you to suppose that I desire your living things! A spiritual God
demands other life than that which is seen in animals; he looks for
spiritual sacrifice, for the love, the trust, the praise, the life of
your hearts.

[Psa 50:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#012)

"If I were hungry, I would not tell thee." Strange conception, a hungry
God! Yet if such an absurd ideal could be truth, and if the Lord
hungered for meat he would not ask it of men. He could provide for
himself out of his own possessions; he would not turn suppliant to his
own creatures. Even under the grossest idea of God, faith in outward
ceremonies is ridiculous. Do men fancy that the Lord needs banners, and
music, and incense, and fine linen? If he did, the stars would emblazon
his standard, the winds and the waves become his orchestra, ten thousand
times ten thousand flowers would breathe forth perfume, the snow should
be his alb, the rainbow his girdle, the clouds of light his mantle. O
fools and slow of heart, ye worship ye know not what! "For the world is
mine, and the fulness thereof." What can he need who is owner of all
things and able to create as he wills? Thus overwhelmingly does the Lord
pour forth his arguments upon formalists.

[Psa 50:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#013)

"Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?" Are you so
infatuated as to think this? Is the great I am subject to corporeal
wants, and are they to be thus grossly satisfied? Heathens thought thus
of their idols, but dare ye think thus of the God who made the heavens
and the earth? Can ye have fallen so low as to think thus of me, O
Israel? What vivid reasoning is here! How the fire-flashes dart into the
idiot faces of trusters in outward forms! Ye dupes of Rome, can ye read
this and be unmoved? The expostulation is indignant; the questions
utterly confound; the conclusion is inevitable; heart worship only can
be acceptable with the true God. It is inconceivable that outward things
can gratify him, except so far as through them our faith and love
express themselves.

[Psa 50:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#014)

"Offer unto God thanksgiving." No longer look at your sacrifices as in
themselves gifts pleasing to me, but present them as the tributes of
your gratitude; it is then that I will accept them, but not while your
souls have no love and no thankfulness to offer me. The sacrifices, as
considered in themselves, are contemned, but the internal emotions of
love consequent upon a remembrance of divine goodness, are commended as
the substance, meaning, and soul of sacrifice. Even when the legal
ceremonials were not abolished, this was true, and when they came to an
end, this truth was more than ever made manifest. Not for want of
bullocks on the altar was Israel blamed, but for want of thankful
adoration before the Lord. She excelled in the visible, but in the
inward grace, which is the one thing needful, she sadly failed. Too many
in these days are in the same condemnation. "And pay thy vows unto the
most High." Let the sacrifice be really presented to the God who seeth
the heart, pay to him the love you promised, the service you covenanted
to render, the loyalty of heart you have vowed to maintain. O for grace
to do this! O that we may be graciously enabled to love God, and live up
to our profession! To be, indeed, the servants of the Lord, the lovers
of Jesus, this is our main concern. What avails our baptism, to what end
our gatherings at the Lord's table, to what purpose our solemn
assemblies, if we have not the fear of the Lord, and vital godliness
reigning within our bosoms?

[Psa 50:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#015)

"And call upon me in the day of trouble." Oh, blessed verse! Is this
then true sacrifice? Is it an offering to ask an alms of heaven? It is
even so. The King himself so regards it. For herein is faith manifested,
herein is love proved, for in the hour of peril we fly to those we love.
It seems a small thing to pray to God when we are distressed, yet is it
a more acceptable worship than the mere heartless presentation of
bullocks and he-goats. This is a voice from the throne, and how full of
mercy it is! It is very tempestuous round about Jehovah, and yet what
soft drops of mercy's rain fall from the bosom of the storm! Who would
not suffer such sacrifice? Troubled one, haste to present it now! Who
shall say that Old Testament saints did not know the gospel? Its very
spirit and essence breathe like frankincense all around this holy Psalm.
"1 will deliver thee." The reality of thy sacrifice of prayer shall be
seen in its answer. Whether the smoke of burning bulls be sweet to me or
no, certainly thy humble prayer shall be, and I will prove it so by my
gracious reply to thy supplication. This promise is very large, and may
refer both to temporal and eternal deliverances; faith can turn it every
way, like the sword of the cherubim. "And thou shalt glorify me." Thy
prayer will honour me, and thy grateful perception of my answering mercy
will also glorify me. The goats and bullocks would prove a failure, but
the true sacrifice never could. The calves of the stall might be a vain
oblation, but not the calves of sincere lips.

Thus we see what is true ritual. Here we read inspired rubrics.
Spiritual worship is the great, the essential matter; all else without
it is rather provoking than pleasing to God. As helps to the soul,
outward offerings were precious, but when men went not beyond them, even
their hallowed things were profaned in the view of heaven.

[Psalms 50:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 50:16</span></span>

16 But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my
statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?

17 Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee.

18 When thou sawest a thief then thou consentedst with him, and hast
been partaker with adulterers.

19 Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.

20 Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine
own mother's son.

21 These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that
I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and
set them in order before thine eyes.

Here the Lord turns to the manifestly wicked among his people; and such
there were even in the highest places of his sanctuary. If moral
formalists had been rebuked, how much more these immoral pretenders to
fellowship with heaven? If the lack of heart spoiled the worship of the
more decent and virtuous, how much more would violations of the law,
committed with a high hand, corrupt the sacrifices of the wicked?

[Psa 50:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#016)

"But unto the wicked God saith." To the breakers of the second table he
now addresses himself; he had previously spoken to the neglecters of the
first. "What hast thou to do to declare my statutes?" You violate openly
my moral law, and yet are great sticklers for my ceremonial commands!
What have you to do with them? What interest can you have in them? Do
you dare to teach my law to others, and profane it yourselves? What
impudence, what blasphemy is this! Even if you claim to be sons of Levi,
what of that? Your wickedness disqualifies you, disinherits you, puts
you out of the succession. It should silence you, and would if my people
were as spiritual as I would have them, for they would refuse to hear
you, and to pay you the portion of temporal things which is due to my
true servants. You count up your holy days, you contend for rituals, you
fight for externals, and yet the weightier matters of the law ye
despise! Ye blind guides, ye strain out gnats and swallow camels; your
hypocrisy is written on your foreheads and manifest to all. "Or that
thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth." Ye talk of being in
covenant with me, and yet trample my holiness beneath your feet as swine
trample upon pearls; think ye that I can brook this? Your mouths are
full of lying and slander, and yet ye mouth my words as if they were fit
morsels for such as you! How horrible an evil it is, that to this day we
see men explaining doctrines who despise precepts! They make grace a
coverlet for sin, and even judge themselves to be sound in the faith,
while they are rotten in life. We need the grace of the doctrines as
much as the doctrines of grace, and without it an apostle is but a
Judas, and a fair-spoken professor is an arrant enemy of the cross of
Christ.

[Psa 50:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#017)

"Seeing thou hatest instruction." Profane professors are often too wise
to learn, too besotted with conceit to be taught of God. What a
monstrosity that men should declare those statutes which with their
hearts they do not know, and which in their lives they openly disavow!
Woe unto the men who hate the instruction which they take upon
themselves to give. "And castest my words behind thee." Despising them,
throwing them away as worthless, putting them out of sight as obnoxious.
Many boasters of the law did this practically; and in these last days
there are pickers and choosers of God's words who cannot endure the
practical part of Scripture; they are disgusted at duty, they abhor
responsibility, they disembowel texts of their plain meanings, they
wrest the Scriptures to their own destruction. It is an ill sign when a
man dares not look a Scripture in the face, and an evidence of brazen
impudence when he tries to make it mean something less condemnatory of
his sins, and endeavours to prove it to be less sweeping in its demands.
How powerful is the argument that such men have no right to take the
covenant of God into their mouths, seeing that its spirit does not
regulate their lives!

[Psa 50:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#018)

"When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him." Moral
honesty cannot be absent where true grace is present. Those who excuse
others in trickery are guilty themselves; those who use others to do
unjust actions for them are doubly so. If a man be ever so religious, if
his own actions do not rebuke dishonesty, he is an accomplice with
thieves. If we can acquiesce in anything which is not upright, we are
not upright ourselves, and our religion is a lie. "And hast been
partaker with adulterers." One by one the moral precepts are thus broken
by the sinners in Zion. Under the cloak of piety, unclean livers conceal
themselves. We may do this by smiling at unchaste jests, listening to
indelicate expressions, and conniving at licentious behaviour in our
presence; and if we thus act, how dare we preach, or lead public prayer,
or wear the Christian name? See how the Lord lays righteousness to the
plummet! How plainly all this declares that without holiness no man
shall see the Lord! No amount of ceremonial or theological accuracy can
cover dishonesty and fornication; these filthy things must be either
purged from us by the blood of Jesus, or they will kindle a fire in
God's anger which will burn even to the lowest hell.

[Psa 50:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#019)

"Thou givest thy mouth to evil." Sins against the ninth commandment are
here mentioned. The man who surrenders himself to the habit of slander
is a vile hypocrite if he associates himself with the people of God. A
man's health is readily judged by his tongue. A foul mouth, a foul
heart. Some slander almost as often as they breathe, and yet are great
upholders of the church, and great sticklers for holiness. To what
depths will not they go in evil, who delight in spreading it with their
tongues? "And thy tongue frameth deceit." This is a more deliberate sort
of slander, where the man dexterously elaborates false witness, and
concocts methods of defamation. There is an ingenuity of calumny in some
men, and, alas! even in some who are thought to be followers of the Lord
Jesus. They manufacture falsehoods, weave them in their loom, hammer
them on their anvil, and then retail their wares in every company. Are
these accepted with God? Though they bring their wealth to the altar,
and speak eloquently of truth and of salvation, have they any favour
with God? We should blaspheme the holy God if we were to think so. They
are corrupt in his sight, a stench in his nostrils. He will cast all
liars into hell. Let them preach, and pray, and sacrifice as they will;
till they become truthful, the God of truth loathes them utterly.

[Psa 50:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#020)

"Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother." He sits down to it,
makes it his meat, studies it, resolves upon it, becomes a master of
defamation, occupies the chair of calumny. His nearest friend is not
safe, his dearest relative escapes not. "Thou slanderest thine own
mother's son." He ought to love him best, but he has an ill word for
him. The son of one's own mother was to the Oriental a very tender
relation; but the 'wretched slanderer knows no claims of kindred. He
stabs his brother in the dark, and aims a blow at him who came forth of
the same womb' yet he wraps himself in the robe of hypocrisy, and dreams
that he is a favourite of heaven, an accepted worshipper of the Lord.
Are such monsters to be met with nowadays? Alas! they pollute our
churches still, and are roots of bitterness, spots in our solemn feasts,
wandering stars for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.
Perhaps some such may read these lines, but they will probably read them
in vain; their eyes are too dim to see their own condition, their hearts
are waxen gross, their ears are dull of hearing; they are given up to a
strong delusion to believe a lie, that they may be damned.

[Psa 50:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#021)

"These things hast thou done, and I kept silence." No swift judgment
overthrew the sinner - long-suffering reigned; no thunder was heard in
threatening, and no bolt of fire was hurled in execution. "Thou
thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself." The inference
drawn from the Lord's patience was infamous: the respited culprit
thought his judge to be one of the same order as himself. He offered
sacrifice, and deemed it accepted; he continued in sin, and remained
unpunished, and therefore he rudely said, "Why need believe these crazy
prophets? God cares not how we live so long as we pay our tithes. Little
does he consider how we get the plunder, so long as we bring a bullock
to his altar." What will not men imagine of the Lord? At one time they
liken the glory of Israel to a calf and anon their brutish selves. "But
I will reprove thee." At last I will break silence and let thee know my
mind. "And set them in order before thine eyes." I will marshal thy sins
in battle array. I will make thee see them, I will put them down item by
item, classified, and arranged. Thou shalt know that if silent awhile, I
was never blind or deaf. I will make thee perceive what thou hast tried
to deny. I will leave the seat of mercy for the throne of judgment, and
there will I let thee see how great the difference between thee and me.

[Psalms 50:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 50:22</span></span>

22 Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and
there be none to deliver.

"Now" or oh! it is a word of entreaty, for the Lord is loth even to let
the most ungodly run on to destruction. "Consider this;" take these
truths to heart, ye who trust in ceremonies and ye who live in vice, for
both of you sin in that "ye forget God." Bethink you how unaccepted you
are, and turn unto the Lord. See how you have mocked the eternal, and
repent of your iniquities. "Lest I tear you in pieces," as a lion rends
his prey, "and there be none to deliver," no Saviour, no refuge, no
hope. Ye reject the Mediator: beware, for ye will sorely need one in the
day of wrath, and none will be near to plead for you. How terrible, how
complete, how painful, how humiliating, will be the destruction of the
wicked! God uses no soft words, or velvet metaphors, nor may his
servants do so when they speak of the wrath to come. O reader, consider
this.

[Psalms 50:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 50:23</span></span>

23 Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me and to him that ordereth his
conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God.

"Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me." Praise is the best sacrifice;
true, hearty, gracious thanksgiving from a renewed mind. Not the lowing
of bullocks bound to the altar, but the songs of redeemed men are the
music which the ear of Jehovah delights in. Sacrifice your loving
gratitude, and God is honoured thereby. "And to him that ordereth his
conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God." Holy living is a
choice evidence of salvation. He who submits his whole way to divine
guidance, and is careful to honour God in his life, brings an offering
which the Lord accepts through his dear Son; and such a one shall be
more and more instructed, and made experimentally to know the Lord's
salvation. He needs salvation, for the best ordering of the life cannot
save us, but that salvation he shall have. Not to ceremonies, not to
unpurified lips, is the blessing promised, but to grateful hearts and
holy lives.

O Lord, give us to stand in the judgment with those who have worshipped
thee aright and have seen thy salvation.
