### [Psalms Chapter 91](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 91:0</span></span>

This Psalm is without a title, and we have no means of ascertaining
either the name of its writer, or the date of its composition, with
certainty. The Jewish doctors consider that when the author's name is
not mentioned we may assign the Psalm to the last-named writer; and, if
so, this is another Psalm of Moses, the man of God. Many expressions
here used are similar to those of Moses in Deuteronomy, and the internal
evidence, from the peculiar idioms, would point towards him as the
composer. The continued lives of Joshua and Caleb, who followed the Lord
fully, make remarkably apt illustrations of this Psalm, for they, as a
reward for abiding in continued nearness to the Lord, lived on "amongst
the dead, amid their graves." For these reasons it is by no means
improbable that this Psalm may have been written by Moses, but we dare
not dogmatize. David's pen was used in giving us this matchless ode, we
cannot believe as some do that he thus commemorated the plague which
devastated Jerusalem on account of his numbering the people. For him,
then, to sing of himself as seeing "the reward of the wicked" would be
clean contrary to his declaration, "I have sinned, but these sheep, what
have they done?"; and the absence of any allusion to the sacrifice upon
Zion could not be in any way accounted for, since David's repentance
would inevitably have led him to dwell upon the atoning sacrifice and
the sprinkling of blood by the hyssop.

In the whole collection there is not a more cheering Psalm, its tone is
elevated and sustained throughout, faith is at its best, and speaks
nobly. A German physician was wont 1o speak of it as the best
preservative in times of cholera, and in truth it is a heavenly medicine
against plague and pest. He who can live in its spirit will be fearless,
even if once again London should become a lazar-house, and the grave be
gorged with carcases.

Division. - On this occasion we shall follow the divisions which our
translators have placed at the head of the Psalm, for they are pithy and
suggestive. [Psa 91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md). The state of
the godly. [Psa 91:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#003.md). Their safety.
[Psa 91:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#009.md). Their habitation. [Psa
91:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011.md). Their servants. [Psa
91:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#014.md). Their friend; with the effects
of them all.

91:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#012.md). -

I. The Ministry of Angels as employed by God.

1\. Official: "he shall give," etc.

2\. Personal: "over thee."

3\. Constant, "in all thy ways."

II\. As enjoyed by man.

1\. For preservation, "shall bear thee," etc.; tenderly but effectually.

2\. Under limitation. They cannot do the work of God, or of Christ, or
of the Spirit, or of the word, or of ministers, for salvation; "are they
not all ministering spirits," etc. - G. R.

[Psa 91:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#012.md). - Preservation from minor
evils most precious because they are often most grievous, lead to
greater evils, and involve much damage.

[Psa 91:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#013.md). - The believer's love set

tread," etc.; "shall put thy foot," etc.; "the Lord shall bruise Satan,"
etc. - G. R.

[Psa 91:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#014.md). - Here we have,

I. Love for love, "Because," etc.

1\. The fact of the saints' love to God. There is, first, love in God
without their love, then love for their love.

2\. The evidence of his love to them, "I will deliver him" - from sin,
from danger, from temptation,' from every evil.

II\. Honour for honour.

1\. His honouring God. "He hath known my name" and made it known;

2\. God honouring him; "I will set him on high" - high in honour, in
happiness, in glory. - G. R.

[Psa 91:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#015.md), [Psa
91:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#016.md). - Observe,

I. The exceeding great and precious promises.

1\. Answer to prayer, "he shall call," etc.

2\. Comfort in trouble, "I will be with him."

3\. Deliverance from trouble, "I will deliver him."

4\. Greater honour after trouble: deliver "and honour him."

5\. Length of days; life long enough to satisfy him.

6\. God's salvation: "shew him my salvation;" far beyond what man could
think or desire.

II\. To whom these promises belong; who is the he and the him to whom
these promises are made. He "calls upon God," says [Psa
91:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#015.md); he "hath known my name," says
[Psa 91:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#014.md); he "hath set his love upon
me," says the former part of the same verse; he "has made the Lord his
habitation," says [Psa 91:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#009.md); he
"dwelleth in the secret place of the most High," says [Psa
91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md). Hannah More says, "To preach
privileges without specifying to whom they belong is like putting a
letter in the post-office without a direction." It may be very good and
contain a valuable remittance, but no one can tell for whom it is
intended. All the promises of Scriptures are plainly directed to those
to whom they belong. The direction put upon the promises of this Psalm
is unmistakably clear and often repeated. - G. R.

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Whole Psalm

The Talmud writers ascribe not only the ninety-first Psalm, but the nine
ensuing, to the pen of Moses; but from a rule which will in no respect
hold, that all the Psalms which are without the name of an author in
their respective titles are the production of the poet whose name is
given in the nearest preceding title. And though it is impossible to
prove that this highly beautiful ode was not written by David, the
general drift of its scenery and allusions rather concur in showing
that, like the last, we are indebted for it to the muse of Moses, that
it was composed by him during the journey through the wilderness,
shortly after the plague of the fiery serpents; when the children of
Israel, having returned to a better spirit, were again received into the
favour of jehovah. Besides political enemies, the children of Israel in
the wilderness had other evils in great numbers to encounter, from the
nature and diseases of the climate, which exposed them to coups de
soleil, or sun smitings, during the heat of the day; and to pestilential
vapours, moon smitings, during the damp of the night, so as to render
the miraculous canopy of the cloud that hung over them in the former
season, and the miraculous column of fire that cheered and purified them
in the latter, equally needful and refreshing. In Egypt, they had seen
so much of the plague, and they had been so fearfully threatened with it
as a punishment for disobedience, that they could not but be in dread of
its reappearance, from the incessant fatigues of their journeying. In
addition to all which, they had to be perpetually on their guard against
the insidious attacks of the savage monsters and reptiles of "that great
and terrible wilderness," as Moses describes it on another occasion,
"wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought; where there
was no water" ([Deu 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#015).md); and where,
also, as we learn from other parts of Scripture, bears, lions, leopards
or tigers, and "the wolf of the evening," as Jeremiah has beautifully
expressed it, prowled without restraint. Now in the Psalm before us, and
especially in the [Psa 91:6-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#006.md), we
have so clear and graphic a description of the whole of these evils
presented to us, as to bring its composition directly home to the
circumstances and the period here pitched upon, and to render it at
least needless to hunt out for any other occasion. - J. M. Good's
"Historical Outline of the Book of Psalms," 1842.

Whole Psalm

It is one of the most excellent works of this kind which has ever
appeared. It is impossible to imagine anything more solid, more
beautiful, more profound, or more ornamented. Could the Latin or any
modern language express thoroughly all the beauties and elegancies as
well of the words as of the sentences, it would not be difficult to
persuade the reader that we have no poem, either in Greek or Latin,
comparable to this Hebrew ode. - Simon de Muis.

Whole Psalm

Psalm 90 spoke of man withering away beneath God's anger against sin.
Psalm 91 tells of a Man, who is able to tread the lion and adder under
his feet. - Undoubtedly the Tempter was right in referring this Psalm to
"the Son of God" ([Mat 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#006).md).

The imagery of the Psalm seems to be in part drawn from that Passover
Night, when the Destroying Angel passed through Egypt; while the
faithful and obedient Israelites were sheltered by God. - William Kay.

[Psa 91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md)

"He," no matter who he may be, rich or poor, learned or unlearned,
patrician or plebeian, young or old, for "God is no respecter of
persons," but "he is rich to all that call upon him." - Bellarmine.

[Psa 91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md)

"He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High." Note, he who
dwells in the secret place of the Most High is not he that conjures up
one or two slight and fleeting acts of hope in him, but the man that
places in him an assiduous and constant confidence. In this way he
establishes for himself in God by that full trust, a home, a
dwelling-place, a mansion,... The Hebrew for he that dwelleth, is ישׁן,
that is, dwelling in quietude, and resting, enduring and remaining with
constancy. - Le Blanc.

[Psa 91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md)

"He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High." What intimate
and unrestrained communion does this describe! - the Christian in
everything making known his heart, with its needs and wishes, its
thoughts and feelings, its doubts and anxieties, its sorrows and its
joys, to God, as to a loving, perfect friend. And all is not on one
side. This Almighty Friend has admitted his chosen one to his "secret
place." It is almost too wonderful to be true. It is almost too
presumptuous a thought for such creatures as we are to entertain. But he
himself permits it, desires it, teaches us to realise that it is
communion to which he calls us. "The secret of the Lord is with them
that fear him." And what is this "secret"? It is that in God which the
world neither knows, nor sees, nor cares to enjoy. It is his mind
revealed to those that love him, his plans, and ways ("He made known his
ways to Moses," [Psa 103:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#007).md), and
thoughts opened to them. Yea, and things hid from angels are manifest to
the least of his friends, ([Pe1 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#012).md).
He wishes us to know him, and by his Word and by his Spirit he puts
himself before us. Ah! it is not his fault if we do not know him. It is
our own carelessness. - Mary B. M. Duncan, in "Under the Shadow," 1867.

[Psa 91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md)

By "secret" here is meant a place of refuge from the storms of the world
under the secret of his providence, who careth for all his children.
Also, by the "secret of the most High," some writers understand the
castle of his mighty defence, to which his people run, being pursued by
enemies, as the wild creature doth to his hole or den for succour, when
the hunter hath him in chase, and the dogs are near. This then being the
meaning of that which the prophet calleth the "secret place of the most
High," and our dwelling in it, by confidence in him; we learn, in all
troubles, to cleave to God chiefly or only for help, and to means but as
underlings to his providence....

That which is here translated "dwelleth," is as much in weight as
sitteth, or is settled; and so, our dwelling in God's secret, is as much
as our sitting down in it; the meaning is, we must make it our rest, as
if we should say, Here will we dwell. From whence we learn, that God's
children should not come to God's secret-place as guests to an inn, but
as inhabitants to their own dwellings; that is, they should continue to
trust in God, as well in want as in fulness; and as much when they
wither in their root, as when they flourish in it. - Robert Horn.

[Psa 91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md)

"He that dwelleth," etc.

1\. He dwells, therefore he shall "abide." He shall lodge quietly,
securely.

2\. "He dwells in the secret place," therefore he shall "abide under the
shadow." In the cool, the favour, the cover from the heat.

3\. "He dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High, therefore he
shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty;" i.e., of the all-powerful
God, of the God of heaven; of that God whose name is Shaddai,
All-sufficient. - Adam Clarke.

[Psa 91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md)

"Shall abide." The Hebrew for "shall abide" is יתלונן which signifies he
shall pass the night. Abiding denotes a constant and continuous dwelling
of the just in the assistance and protection of God. That help and
protection of God is not like a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, or in a
vineyard; which is destroyed in a moment, nor is it like a tent in the
way which is abandoned by the traveller. It is a strong tower, a
paternal home, wherein we spend all our life with the best, wealthiest,
and mightiest of parents. Passing the night also denotes security and
rest in time of darkness, temptations and calamities. With God Abraham
passed the night, when He foretold to him the affliction of his
descendants in Egypt, and their deliverance, [Gen
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#012.md) seq. Then also God said to him
([Gen 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#001).md), Fear not Abram, I am thy
shield. And leading him forth he showed him the glittering stars, and
said, Tell the number of the stars, if thou be able; so shall thy seed
be. - Le Blanc.

[Psa 91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md)

"The shadow." The allusion of this verse may be to the awful and mystic
symbols of the ark. Under the ancient ceremony, the high priest only
could enter, and that but once a year, into the holy place, where stood
the emblems of the divine glory and presence; but under the present
bright and merciful dispensation, every true believer has access, with
boldness, into the holiest of all; and he who now dwelleth in the secret
place of prayer and communion with the God of salvation, shall find the
divine mercy and care spread over him for his daily protection and
solace. - John Morison.

[Psa 91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md)

"Under the shadow of the Almighty." This is an expression which implies
great nearness. We must walk very close to a companion, if we would have
his shadow fall on us. Can we imagine any expression more perfect in
describing the constant presence of God with his chosen ones, than this
- they shall "abide under his shadow"? In Solomon's beautiful allegory,
the Church in a time of special communion with Christ, says of him - "I
sat down under his shadow with great delight" ([Sol
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#003).md) - "sat down," desiring not to
leave it, but to abide there for ever. And it is he who chooses to dwell
in the secret place of the most High, who shall "abide under the shadow
of the Almighty." There is a condition and a promise attached to it. The
condition is, that we "dwell in the secret place," - the promise, that
if we do so we "shall abide under the shadow." It is of importance to
view it thus. For when we remember the blessing is a promised blessing -
we are led to feel it is a gift - a thing therefore to be prayed for in
faith, as well as sought for by God's appointed means. Ah, the hopes
that this awakens! My wandering, wavering, unstable heart, that of
itself cannot keep to one course two days together, is to seek its
perseverance from God, and not in its own strength. He will hold it to
him if it be but seeking for stedfastness. It is not we who cling to
him. It is he who keeps near to us. - Maul B. M. Duncan.

[Psa 91:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md), [Psa
91:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#009.md)

O you that be in fear of any danger, leave all carnal shifts, and
carking counsels, and projects, and dwell in the rock of God's power and
providence, and be like the dove that nestles in the holes of the rock;
by faith betake yourselves unto God, by faith dwell in that rock, and
there nestle yourselves, make your nests of safety in the clefts of this
rock. But how may we do this thing, and what is the way to do it? Do
this, - Set thy faith on work to make God that unto thee which thy
necessity requires, pitch and throw thyself upon his power and
providence, with a resolution of spirit to rest thyself upon it for
safety, come what will come. See an excellent practice of this, [Psa
91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md), "He that dwelleth in the secret
place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty;"
that is, he shall be safe from all fears and dangers. Ay, that is true,
you will say, who makes any doubt of it? But how shall a man come to
dwell, and get into this secret place, within this strong tower? See
[Psa 91:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#002.md), "I will say of the Lord, He
is my refuge and my fortress;" as if he had said, I will not only say,
that he is a refuge; but he is my refuge, I will say to the Lord; that
is, I will set my faith on work in particular, to throw, devolve, and
pitch myself upon him for my safety. And see what follows upon this
setting faith thus on work, [Psa 91:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#003.md),
[Psa 91:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#004.md), "Surely he shall deliver
thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He
shall cover thee with his feathers," etc. So confident the Psalmist is
that upon this course taken, safety shall follow.

Our safety lies not simply upon this, because God is a refuge, and is an
habitation, but "Because thou hast made the Lord which is my refuge, thy
habitation, there shall no evil befall thee," etc. It is therefore the
making of God our habitation, upon which our safety lies; and this is
the way to make God an habitation, thus to pitch and cast ourselves by
faith upon his power and providence. - Jeremiah Dyke.

[Psa 91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md)

We read of a stag that roamed about in the greatest security, by reason
of its having a label on its neck, "Touch me not, I belong to Caesar":
thus the true servants of God are always safe, even among lions, bears,
serpents, fire, water, thunder, and tempests; for all creatures know and
reverence the shadow of God. - Bellarmine.

[Psa 91:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#002.md)

"My refuge, my fortress, my God." "My refuge." God is our "refuge." He
who avails himself of a refuge is one who is forced to fly. It is a
quiet retreat from a pursuing enemy. And there are trials, and
temptations, and enemies, from which the Christian does best to fly. He
cannot resist them. They are too strong for him. His wisdom is to fly
into the refuge of the secret place of his God - to rest in the shadow
of the Almighty. His "strength is to sit still" there. [Isa
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#007.md). "My fortress." The Psalmist
says, moreover, that God is his "fortress." Here - the idea is changed -
no longer a peaceful, quiet hiding-place, but a tower of defence -
strong, manifest, ready to meet the attacks of all enemies, ready and
able to resist them all. God is a Friend who meets every want in our
nature, who can supply every need. So when we are weak and fainting, and
unable to meet the brunt of battle, and striving against sin and sorrow
and the wrath of man, he is our safe, quiet resting-place - our fortress
also where no harm can reach us, no attack injure us. "My God." Now the
Psalmist, as a summing up of all his praises, says "I will say of him,
He is ... my God!" Is there anything omitted in the former part of his
declaration? Everything is here - all possible ascription Of honour, and
glory, and power to him "as God" - "God over all, blessed for ever," and
of love, reverence, trust, obedience, and filial relation towards him on
the part of the Psalmist, as My God ... when reflecting on the refuge
and strength which the Lord has always been to him, and recalling his
blessed experiences of sweet communion with God - words fail him. He can
only say (but oh, with what expression!) My God! - Mary B. M. Duncan.

[Psa 91:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#002.md)

"My God." Specially art thou my God, first, on thy part, because of the
special goodness and favour which thou dost bestow upon me. Secondly, on
my part, because of the special love and reverence with which I cling to
thee. - J. Paulus Palanterius.

[Psa 91:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#002.md)

If the severity and justice of God terrify, the Lord offereth himself as
a bird with stretched out wings to receive the supplicant, [Psa
91:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#004.md). If enemies who are too strong do
pursue, the Lord openeth his bosom as a refuge, [Psa
91:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#002.md). If the child be assaulted, he
becometh a fortress, [Psa 91:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#002.md). If he
be hotly pursued and enquired after, the Lord becometh a secret place to
hide his child; if persecution be hot, God giveth himself for a shadow;
if potentates and mighty rulers turn enemies, the Lord interposeth as
the Most High and Almighty Saviour, [Psa
91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md). If his adversaries be crafty
like fowlers or hunters, the Lord promiseth to prevent and break the
snares, [Psa 91:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#003.md). Whether evils do
come upon the believer night or day, secretly or openly, to destroy him,
the Lord preserveth his child from destruction; and if stumbling-blocks
be laid in his child's way, he hath his instruments, his servants, his
angels, prepared to keep the believer that he stumble not, "He shall
give his angels charge over thee"; not one angel only, but all of them,
or a number of them. - David Dickson.

[Psa 91:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#003.md)

"He shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler." Are we therefore
beasts? Beasts doubtless. When man was in honour he understood not, but
was like the foolish beasts. \[Ps. 49\] Men are certainly beasts,
wandering sheep, having no shepherd. - Why art thou proud, O man? Why
dost thou boast thyself O smatterer? See what a beast thou art, for whom
the snares of the fowler are being prepared. But who are these fowlers?
The fowlers indeed are the worst and wickedest, the cleverest and the
cruellest. The fowlers are they who sound no horn, that they may not be
heard, but shoot their arrows in secret places at the innocent.... But
lo! since we know the fowlers and the beasts, our further enquiry must
be, what this snare may be. I wish not myself to invent it, nor to
deliver to you what is subject to doubt. The Apostle shows us this
snare, for he was not ignorant of the devices of these fowlers. Tell us,
I pray, blessed Paul, what this snare of the devil is, from which the
faithful soul rejoices that it is delivered? They that will be rich \[in
this world?\] says he, fall into temptation and the snare \[of the
devil?\] (1 Tim. 6). Are not the riches of this world, then, the snare
of the devil? Alas! how few we find who can boast of freedom from this
snare, how many who grieve that they seem to themselves too little
enmeshed in the net, and who still labour and toil with all their
strength to involve and entangle themselves more and more. Ye who have
left all and followed the Son of man who has not where to lay his head,
rejoice and say, He hath delivered me from the snare of the fowlers. -
Bernard.

[Psa 91:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#003.md)

"Surely he shall deliver thee from the noisome pestilence." Lord Craven
lived in London when that sad calamity, the plague, raged. His house was
in that part of the town called Craven Buildings. On the plague growing
epidemic, his Lordship, to avoid the danger, resolved to go to his seat
in the country. His coach and six were accordingly at the door, his
baggage put up, and all things in readiness for the journey. As he was
walking through his hall with his hat on, his cane under his arm, and
putting on his gloves, in order to step into his carriage, he overheard
his negro, who served him as postillion, saying to another servant, "I
suppose, by my Lord's quitting London to avoid the plague, that his God
lives in the country, and not in town." The poor negro said this in the
simplicity of his heart, as really believing a plurality of gods. The
speech, however, struck Lord Craven very sensibly, and made him pause.
"My God," thought he, "lives everywhere, and can preserve me in town as
well as in the country. I will even stay where I am. The ignorance of
that negro has just now preached to me a very useful sermon. Lord,
pardon this unbelief, and that distrust of thy providence, which made me
think of running from thy hand." He immediately ordered his horses to be
taken from the coach, and the baggage to be taken in. He continued in
London, was remarkably useful among his sick neighbours, and never
caught the infection. - Whitecross's Anecdotes.

91:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#006.md)

"Pestilence." It is from a word (דּבר) that signifies to speak, and
speak out; the pestilence is a speaking thing, it proclaims the wrath of
God amongst a people. Drusius fetches it from the same root, but in
piel, which is to decree; showing that the pestilence is a thing decreed
in heaven, not casual. Kirker thinks it is called דּבר, because it keeps
order, and spares neither great nor small. The Hebrew root signifies to
destroy, to cut off, and hence may the plague or pestilence have its
name. The Septuagint renders it θάνατος, death, for ordinarily it is
death; and it is expressed by "Death." [Rev
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#008.md), he sat on the pale horse, and
killed with sword, hunger, death, and beasts of the earth; it refers to
[Eze 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#021.md), where the pestilence is
mentioned. Pestilence may be from a word which signifies to spread,
spoil, rush upon, for it doth so; [Sa2
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#015.md), seventy thousand slain in three
days; and plague, a πλήγη from πλησσω, to smite, to wound, for it smites
suddenly, and wounds mortally; hence it is in [Num
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#012.md), "I will smite them with the
pestilence." This judgment is very grievous, it is called in [Psa
91:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#003.md) the "noisome pestilence," because
it is infectious, contagious; and therefore the French read it, "de la
peste dangereuse," from the dangerous pestilence, it doth endanger those
that come near it: and Musculus hath it, a peste omnium pessima, from
the worst pestilence of all: and others, the woful pestilence; it brings
a multitude of woes with it to any place or person it comes unto, it is
a messenger of woful fears, sorrows, distractions, terrors, and death
itself. - William Greenhill.

"He shall cover thee with his feathers," etc. Christ's wings are both
for healing and for hiding ([Mat 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#002).md),
for curing and securing us; the devil and his instruments would soon
devour the servants of God, if he did not set an invincible guard about
them, and cover them with the golden feathers of his protection. -
Thomas Watson.

[Psa 91:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#004.md)

"He shall cover thee with his feathers," etc. This is the promise of the
present life. For the promise of the life to come, who can explain? If
the expectation of the just be gladness, and such gladness, that no
object of desire in the world is worthy to be compared with it, what
will the thing itself be which is expected? No eye, apart from thee, O
God, hath seen what thou hast prepared for them that love thee. Under
these wings, therefore, four blessings are conferred upon us. For under
these we are concealed; under these we are protected from the attack of
the hawks and kites, which are the powers of the air, under these a
salubrious shade refreshes us, and wards off the overpowering heat of
the sun; under these also we are nourished and cherished. - Bernard.

[Psa 91:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#004.md)

"He shall cover thee with his feathers," etc.

His plumes shall make a downie bed,

Where thou shalt rest; He shall display

His wings of truth over thy head,

Which, like a shield, shall drive away

The feares of night, the darts of day.

Thomas Cary.

[Psa 91:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#004.md)

"His truth shall be thy shield and buckler." That which we must oppose
to all perils is the truth, or Word of God; so long as we keep that, and
ward off darts and swords by that means, we shall not be overcome. -
David Dickson.

[Psa 91:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#005.md)

The true remedy against tormenting fear is faith in God; for many
terrible things may befall men when they are most secure, like unto
those which befall men in the night, but for any harm which may befall
the believer this way, the Lord here willeth him to be nothing afraid,
"Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night." Many sadder
accidents may befall men when they are most watching and upon their
guard, but the Lord willeth the believer to be confident that he shall
not be harmed this way, "Thou shalt not be afraid for the arrow that
flieth by day." Many evils are men subject unto, which come upon them
men cannot tell how, but from such evils the Lord assureth the believer
he shall have no harm, "Thou shalt not be afraid of the pestilence which
walketh in darkness." Men are subject to many evils which come upon them
openly, and not unawares, such as are calamities from enemies and
oppressors; the Lord willeth the believer to be confident that he shall
not be harmed this way, "Thou shalt not be afraid for the destruction
that wasteth at noonday." - David Dickson.

[Psa 91:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#005.md)

"Thou shalt not be afraid." Not only do the pious stand safe, they are
not even touched with fear. For the prophet does not say, Thou shalt not
be seized; but, Thou shalt not be afraid. Certainly such a confidence of
mind could not be attributed to natural powers, in so menacing and so
overwhelming a destruction. For it is natural to mortals, it is
implanted in them by God the author and maker of nature, to fear
whatever is hurtful and deadly, especially what visibly smites and
suddenly destroys. Therefore does he beautifully join together these two
things; the first, in saying, Thou shalt not be afraid; the second, by
adding, For the terror. He acknowledges that this plague is terrible to
nature; and then by his trust in divine protection he promises himself
this security, that he shall not fear the evil, which would otherwise
make human nature quail. Wherefore, in my judgment, those persons are
neither kind (humani) nor pious who are of opinion that so great a
calamity is not to be dreaded by mortals. They neither observe the
condition of our nature, nor honour the blessing of divine protection;
both of which we see here done by the prophet. - Musculus.

[Psa 91:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#005.md)

Not that we are always actually delivered out of every particular danger
or grievance, but because all will turn (such is our confidence in God)
to our greater good; and the more we suffer the greater shall our reward
and our glory be. To the same purpose is the expression of Isaiah, "When
thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the
rivers, they shall not overflow thee, when thou walkest through the
fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon
thee." [Isa 43:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#002.md). So also [Hab
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#017.md), [Hab
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#018.md), "Although the fig tree shall not
blossom," &c.; and [Job 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#019.md), [Job
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#020.md), etc. And therefore here is no
ground, if the words be rightly understood, for any man absolutely to
presume or conclude that he shall actually be delivered out of any
particular danger; much less upon such a presumption wilfully to run
into dangers. If such figures, the ornament of all language; such
rhetorical, emphatical amplifications be allowed to human writers, and
well enough understood in ordinary language; why not to holy writers as
well, who had to do with men, as well as others; whose end also was to
use such expressions as might affect and move? That human writers have
said as much of the security of good and godly men, I shall need to go
no further than Horace his Ode, Integer vitae scelerisque urus &c. Most
dangerous then and erroneous is the inference of some men, yea, of some
expositors, here, upon these words of the Psalmist, that no godly man
can suffer by the plague, or pestilence: nor is old Lactantius his
assertion much sounder, Non potest ergo fieri, quin hominemfustum inter
descrimina tempestature, &c., that no just man can perish by war, or by
tempest (Instit. 1, 5, 100:18). Most interpreters conclude here, that
the godly are preserved in time of public calamities; which, in a right
sense, may be true; but withal they should have added, that all godly
men are not exempted at such times; to prevent rash judgments. -
Westminster Assembly's Annotations.

[Psa 91:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#005.md)

"The arrow" The arrow in this passage probably means the pestilence. The
Arabs denote the pestilence by an allusion to this flying weapon. "I
desired to remove to a less contagious air. I received from Solyman, the
emperor, this message; that the emperor wondered what I meant, in
desiring to remove my habitation; is not the pestilence God's arrow,
which will always hit his mark? If God would visit me herewith, how
could I avoid it? is not the plague, said he, in my own palace, and yet
I do not think of removing." - Busbequiu's Travels. "What, say they, is
not the plague the dart of Almighty God, and can we escape the blow that
he levels at us? is not his hand steady to hit the persons he aims at?
can we run out of his sight, and beyond his power?" - Smith's Remarks on
the Turks, 1673. Herbert also speaking of Curroon, says, "That year his
empire was so wounded with God's arrows of plague, pestilence, and
famine, as this thousand years before was never so terrible." See [Eze
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#016.md). - S. Burder's Scripture
Expositor.

Joseph Scaliger explains, in Epis. 9, these two Verses thus, thou shalt
not fear, מפּחד from consternation by night, מחץ, from the arrow filling
by day, מדּבר from pestilence walking at evening, מקּמב, from
devastation at noon. Under these four he comprehends all the evils and
dangers to which man is liable. And as the Hebrews divide the
four-and-twenty hours of day and night into four parts, namely, evening,
midnight, morning, and mid-day, so he understands the hours of danger to
be divided accordingly in a word, "that the man who has made God his
refuge," is always safe, day and night, at every hour, from every
danger. - Bythner.

[Psa 91:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#006.md)

"The pestilence that walketh in darkness; the destruction that wasteth
at noonday." The description is equally forcible and correct. The
diseases of all hot climates, and especially where vegetation is highly
luxuriant, and marshes and miry swamps are abundant, as in the
wilderness here referred to, proceed from the accumulating vapours of
the night, or from the violence of the sun's rays at mid-day. The
Beriberi of Ceylon, the spasmodic cholera and jungle-fever of India, and
the greater part of the fevers of inter-tropical climates, especially
that called the yellow fever, chiefly originate from the first of theses
"the pestilence that stalketh in darkness"; while sun-strokes or coups
de soleil, apoplexies, inflammations of the brain, and liver-complaints
of most kinds, proceed from the second, "the destruction that wasteth at
noonday." And it is in allusion to this double source of mischief that
the Psalmist exclaims most beautifully on another occasion, [Psa
121:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#006.md) : "The sun shall not smite thee
by day, nor the moon by night." And hence the Israelites were
miraculously defended against both during their passage through the
wilderness by the pillar of a cloud in the day-time, to ward off the
solar rays; and by the pillar of fire by night, to dissipate the
collecting vapours, and preserve the atmosphere clear, dry, and healthy.
- J. M. Good.

[Psa 91:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#006.md)

The putrid plague-fever often comes on in the night while the patient is
asleep; the solstitial disease seizes in heat of harvest upon a man in
open air, and cuts him off, perhaps ere evening. It is safety from
perils like these that is spoken of. All these blessings are derived
from and rest on ([Psa 91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001).md) the
position of him that claims them "under the covert of the Most High." -
Andrew A. Bonar.

[Psa 91:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#006.md)

"The pestilence that walketh in darkness." It walketh not so much in
natural darkness, or in the darkness of the night, as in a figurative
darkness, no man knowing where it walks, or whither it will walk, in the
clearest light, whether to the poor man's house, or to the rich man's
house, whether to the dwelling of the plebeian, or of the prince, till
it hath left its own mark, and given a deadly stroke. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 91:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#007.md)

"Ten thousand." The word myriad would better represent the exact idea in
the original, as the Hebrew word is different from that which is
translated "a thousand." It is here put for any large number. - Albert
Barnes.

[Psa 91:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#007.md)

"It shall not come nigh thee." Not nigh thee? What? when they die on
this side and on that side, on every hand of a man, doth it not come
nigh him? Yes, nigh him, but not so nigh as to hurt him: the power of
God can bring us near to danger, and yet keep us far from harm. As good
may be locally near us, and yet virtually far from us, so may evil. The
multitude thronged Christ in the Gospel, and yet but one touched him so
as to receive good; so Christ can keep us in a throng of dangers, that
not one shall touch us to our hurt. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 91:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#007.md)

"It shall not come nigh thee." Not with a view of showing that all good
men may hope to escape from the pestilence, but as proofs that some who
have had superior faith have done so, I have collected the following
instances from various sources. - C. H. S.

Before his departure from Isna \[Isny\], the town was greatly afflicted
with the pestilence; and he understanding that many of the wealthiest of
the inhabitants intended to forsake the place, without having any
respect or care of such as laboured with that disease, and that the
houses of such as were infected, were commanded to be shut up by the
magistrate, he openly admonished them, either to continue the town, or
liberally to bestow their alms before their departure, for the relief of
such as were sick. And during the time of the visitation, he himself in
person would visit those that were sick; he would administer spiritual
comfort unto them, pray for them, and would be present with them day and
night; and yet by the providence of God he remained untouched, and was
preserved by the allpowerful hand of God. - From the Life of Paulus
Fagius, in T. Fuller's Abel Redevivus.

In 1576, Cardinal Carlo Borromeo, Archbishop of Milan, the worthiest of
all the successors of St. Ambrose, when he learned at Lodi, that the
plague had made its appearance in his city, went at once to the city.
His council of clergy advised him to remain in some healthy part of his
diocese till the sickness should have spent itself, but he replied that
a bishop, whose duty it is to give his life for his sheep, could not
rightly abandon them in time of peril. They owned that to stand by them
was the higher course. "Well," he said, "is it not a bishop's duty to
choose the higher course?" So back into the-town of deadly sickness he
went, leading the people to repent, and watching over them in their
suffering, visiting the hospitals, and, by his own example, encouraging
his clergy in carrying spiritual consolation to the dying. All the time
the plague lasted, which was four months, his exertions were fearless
and unwearied, and what was remarkable was, that of his whole household
only two died, and they were persons who had not been called to go about
among the sick. - From "A Book of Golden Deeds," 1864.

Although Defoe's history of the plague is a work of fiction, yet its
statements are generally facts, and therefore we extract the following:
- "The misery of the poor I had many occasions to be an eye-witness of,
and sometimes also of the charitable assistance that some pious people
daily gave to such, sending them relief and supplies both of food,
physic, and other help, as they found they wanted Some pious ladies were
transported with zeal in so good a work, and so confident in the
protection of Providence in discharge of the great duty of charity, that
they went about in person distributing alms to the poor, and even
visiting poor families, though sick and infected, in their very houses,
appointing nurses to attend those that wanted attending, and ordering
apothecaries and surgeons ... giving their blessing to the poor in
substantial relief to them, as well as hearty prayers for them. I will
not undertake to say, as some do, that none of those charitable people
were suffered to fall under the calamity itself; but this I may say,
that I never knew anyone of them that came to any ill, which I mention
for the encouragement of others in case of the like distress; and,
doubtless if they that give to the poor lend to the Lord, and he will
repay them, those that hazard their lives to give to the poor, and to
comfort and assist the poor in such misery as this, may hope to be
protected in the work." - Daniel Defoe's Journal of the Plague in
London.

Horne, in his notes on the Psalms, refers to the plague in Marseilles
and the devotion of its bishop. There is a full account of him in the
Percy Anecdotes from which we call the following: - "M. de Belsunce,
Bishop of Marseilles, so distinguished himself for his humanity during
the plague which raged in that city in 1720, that the Regent of France
offered him the richer and more honourable See of Laon, in Picardy; out
he refused it, saying, he should be unwilling to leave a flock that had
been endeared to him by their sufferings. His pious and intrepid labours
are commemorated in a picture in the Town Hall of Marseilles, in which
he is represented in his episcopal habit, attended by his almoners,
giving his benediction to the dying.... But perhaps the most touching
picture extant of the bishop's humane labours, is to be found in a
letter of his own, written to the Bishop of Soissons, Sept. 27, 1720.
'Never,' he says, 'was desolation greater, nor was ever anything like
this. Here have been many cruel plagues, but none was ever more-cruel,
to be sick and dead was almost the same thing. What a melancholy
spectacle have we on all sides! we go into the streets full of dead
bodies, half rotten through, which we pass to come to a dying body, to
excite him to an act of contrition, and give him absolution.'"
Notwithstanding exposure to a pestilence so fatal, the devoted bishop
escaped uninjured.

While France justly boasts of "Marseilles' good Bishop," England may
congratulate herself on having cherished in her bosom a clergyman who in
an equally earnest manner discharged his pastoral care, and watched over
the simple flock committed to his charge, at no less risk of life, and
with no less fervour of piety and benevolence. The Rev. W. Mompesson was
rector of Eyam in Derbyshire, in the time of the plague that nearly
depopulated the town in the year 1666. During the whole time of the
calamity, he performed the functions of the physician, the legislator,
and the minister of his afflicted parish; assisting the sick with his
medicines, his advice, and his prayers. Tradition still shows a cavern
near Eyam, where this worthy pastor used to preach to such of his
parishioners as had not caught the distemper. Although the village was
almost depopulated, his exertions prevented the spread of the plague to
other districts, and he himself survived unharmed.

[Psa 91:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#008.md)

"Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the
wicked." First, indeed, because of thy own escape; secondly, on account
of thy complete security; thirdly, for the sake of comparison; fourthly,
because of the perfect pre-eminence of justice itself. For then it will
not be the time of mercy, but of judgment; nor shall any mercy in any
way be ever shown towards the wicked there, where no improvement can be
hoped for. Far away will be that softness of human infirmity, which
meanwhile charity nevertheless uses for salvation, collecting in the
ample folds of her outspread net good and bad fishes, that is, pleasant
and hurtful affections. But this is done at sea. On the shore she
chooses only the good, and so rejoicing with them that do rejoice, it
hence comes to pass that she weeps not with those that weep. - Bernard.

[Psa 91:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#009.md)

Here commences the second half of the Psalm. And it is as though the
Psalmist feared lest (as is too often the case with us) we should, in
dwelling on the promises and blessings of God, and applying them to
ourselves, forget the condition to which they are annexed - the
character of those who are to receive them. He therefore pauses here to
remind us of the opening verses of the Psalm, by repeating again their
substance. - Mary B. M. Duncan.

[Psa 91:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#009.md)

"Because thou hast made the Lord," etc. What faith is this, what trust
is that which God hath promised protection and deliverance to in the
time of a plague? What act of faith is it? What faith is it? I answer
first, there is a faith of persuasion, called faith, whereby men are
persuaded and verily believe that they shall not die, nor fall by the
hand of the plague. This is well; but I do not find in the 91st Psalm
that this protection is entailed upon this persuasion, neither do I find
this faith here mentioned.

There is also a faith of reliance, whereby a man doth rely upon God for
salvation; this is a justifying faith, true justifying faith; this is
true faith indeed, but I do not find in this Psalm, that this promise of
protection and deliverance in the time of a plague is entailed upon
this, nor that this is here mentioned.

But again, there is a faith, I may call it a faith of recourse unto God,
whereby a man doth betake himself unto God for shelter, for protection
as to his habitation: when other men do run one this way, another that
way, to their hiding places, in the time of a plague for a man then to
betake himself to God as to his habitation, I think this is the faith
here spoken of in this 91st Psalm: for do but mark the words of the
Psalm: at [Psa 91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md), "He that dwelleth
in the secret place of the Most High," in the hiding place of the Most
High; as if he should say, "When others run from the plague and
pestilence and run to their hiding places, He that dwelleth in the
secret place of the Most High," that betakes himself to God as his
hiding place and his habitation, he shall abide under the shadow of the
Almighty, shall be protected; and so at [Psa
91:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#009.md), "Because thou hast made the Lord
which is my refuge, even the Most High thy habitation, there shall no
evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling;" as
if he should say to us, In time of a plague men are running and looking
out for habitations and hiding places; but because thou hast made the
Lord thy habitation, and hast recourse to him as thy habitation, no evil
shall befall thee, neither shall the plague come nigh thy dwelling:" and
again at [Psa 91:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011.md) it is said, "He
shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways,"
the ways of thy calling; as if he should say, In the time of a plague
men will be very apt to leave station and calling, and so run away from
the plague and pestilence; but saith he, "He shall give his angels
charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways," the ways of thy calling
and place; that is, look when a man in the time of a plague shall
conscientiously keep his station and place, and betake himself to God as
his habitation; this is the faith that is here spoken of, and this is
the faith that God hath promised protection to, here in the 91st
Psalm.... This promise of protection and deliverance is not made to a
believer as a believer, but as acting and exercising faith; for though a
man be a believer, if he do not act and exercise his faith, this promise
will not reach him, therefore if a believer die, not exercising faith
and trusting in God, it is no disparagement to the promise. - William
Bridge.

[Psa 91:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#009.md)

No man can have two homes - two places of constant resort. And if the
Lord be truly "our habitation," we can have no other refuge for our
souls, no other resting-place for our hearts. - Mary B. M. Duncan.

There is a threefold preservation which the church and the members of it
may look for from divine providence. One from, another in, and a third
by, dangers.

I. First, from dangers, according to the promise in one of the Psalms,
"Because thou hast made the Lord who is my refuge, even the Most High
thy habitation: there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any
plague come nigh thy dwelling." Austin had appointed to go to a certain
town to visit the Christians there, and to give them a sermon or more.
The day and place were known to his enemies, who set armed men to lie in
wait for him by the way which he was to pass, and kill him. As God would
have it, the guide whom the people had sent with him to prevent his
going out of the right way mistook, and led him into a by-path, yet
brought him at last to his journey's end. Which when the people
understood, as also the adversaries' disappointment, they adored the
providence of God, and gave him thanks for that great deliverance.

II\. In dangers. So in [Job 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#019.md), [Job
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#020.md). "He shall deliver thee in six
troubles, yea in seven there shall no evil touch thee. In famine he
shall redeem thee from death; and in war from the power of the sword."
In time of famine the widow of Sarepta's store was made to hold out. The
providence of God was with Daniel in the lion's den, shutting up the
mouths of those furious beasts: and with the men in the fiery furnace,
giving a prohibition to the fire that it should not burn, when they were
in the jaws of danger, yea of death. The church hath always been a lily
among thorns, yet flourishes still. This bush is yet far from a
consumption, although it has seldom or never been out of the fire.

III\. By danger. There is a preservation from greater evils by less. No
poison but Providence knoweth how to make an antidote; so Jonah was
swallowed by a whale, and by that danger kept alive. Joseph thrown into
a pit, and afterwards sold into Egypt, and by these hazards brought to
be a nursing father to the church. Chrysostom excellently, Fides in
periculis secura est, in securitate periclitatur. Faith is endangered by
security, but secure in the midst of danger, as Esther's was when she
said, "If I perish I perish." God preserveth us, not as we do fruits
that are to last but for a year, in sugar; but as flesh for a long
voyage in salt, we must expect in this life much brine and pickle,
because our heavenly Father preserveth us as those whom he resolveth to
keep for ever, in and by dangers themselves. Paul's thorn in the flesh,
which had much of danger and trouble in it, was given him on purpose to
prevent pride, which was a great evil. "Lest I," said he, "should be
exalted above measure through abundance of revelations, there was given
me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I
should be exalted above measure." Elsewhere having commemorated
Alexander the coppersmith's withstanding aria doing him much evil, yea
Nero's opening his mouth as a lion against him, and the Lord's
delivering of him thence, he concludeth as more than a conqueror. "And
the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me
unto his heavenly kingdom; to whom be glory for ever and ever, Amen."

Dependence on Christ is not the cause of his hiding us, but it is the
qualification of the person that shall be hid. - Ralph Robinson.

[Psa 91:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#010.md)

"There shall no evil befall thee," etc. It is a security in the very
midst of evils. Not like the security of angels - safety in a world of
safety, quiet in a calm; but it is quiet in a storm, safety amid
desolation and the elements of destruction, deliverance where everything
else is going to wreck. - Charles Bradley, 1840.

[Psa 91:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#010.md)

God doth not say no afflictions shall befall us, but no evil. - Thomas
Watson.

[Psa 91:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#010.md)

Sin which has kindled a fire in hell, is kindling fires on earth
continually. And when they break out, every one is asking how they
happened. Amos replies, "Shall there be evil in a city, and the Lord
hath not done it?" And when desolation is made by fire, Isaiah declares,
The Lord hath "consumed us, because of our iniquities." Many years ago
my house was oft threatened to be destroyed, but the Lord insured it, by
giving me [Psa 91:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#010.md); and the Lord's
providence is the best insurance. - John Berridge.

[Psa 91:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011.md)

"He shall give his angels charge," etc. Charge; charge is a strict
command, more than a bare command; as when you would have a servant do a
business certainly and fully, you lay a charge upon him, I charge you
that you do not neglect that business; you do not barely tell what he
should do, prescribe him his work, but you charge him to do it. So says
the Lord unto the angels, My servants or children, now they are in the
plague and pestilence, O my angels, I charge you stir not from their
houses, I charge you, stir not from such an one's bed-side; it is a
charge, "He shall give his angels charge."

Further, he doth not only, and will not only charge his angel, but his
angels; not one angel charged with the safety of his people, but many
angels; for their better guard and security, "He shall give his angels
charge." And again, "He will give his angels charge over thee to keep
thee;" to keep thee; charge over thee and to keep thee; not only over
the whole church of God, but over every particular member of the church
of God; "He will give his angels charge over thee to keep thee;" this is
his marvellous care. Well, but besides this, "He will give his angels
charge to keep thee in all thy ways," not in some of thy ways, but in
all thy ways. As God's providence is particular in regard of our
persons, so it is universal in regard of our ways. "He will give his
angels charge over thee, to keep thee," not in some but "in all thy
ways."

But is this all? No; "They shall bear thee up in their hands," as every
servant desires and loves to take up the young heir, or the young master
into his arms, so the angels. It is a great matter that the Lord
promiseth to pitch his tents. "And the angels of the Lord shall pitch
their tents round about them that fear him;" but here is more; the
angels shall not only pitch their tents, be their guard, but their
nurses, to bear them up in their hands; but why? "That thou dash not thy
foot against a stone." When children begin to go, they are very apt to
fall and get many a knock; to stumble at every little stone. Now there
are many stones of stumbling that are in our way, and we are very apt to
fall and miscarry; but such is the goodness of God, the providence of
God, the goodness of his providence, that as he hath provided his angels
to be our guard, in opposition to all our foreign enemies, so he hath
provided his angels to be our nurses, in opposition to all our
weaknesses and infirmities, that we get no hurt, that we miscarry not in
the least.

But what need God make use of angels to protect his people, he is able
to do it alone; and is it not for God's dishonour to make use of them
for the protection of his people? No, it is for the honour of God, for
the more honourable the servants are, the instruments are, that a king
or prince doth use for the protecting of his people, the more honourable
is that king or prince. Now the angels, they are honourable creatures;
frequently they are called gods; "Thou hast made him a little lower than
the angels."... They are the fittest people in the world for this
employment, fittest in regard of themselves, fittest in regard of the
saints. They are fittest in regard of themselves, for First, they are an
exceeding strong and potent people; who more fit to look to and care for
the concernments of the saints and people of God, than those that are
strong and potent? It is said of the angels in the [Psa
103:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#001.md), that they excel in strength.
[Psa 103:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#020.md) One angel you know
destroyed a hundred and fourscore thousand of the host of Assyria in a
night.; as one constable will scare away twenty thieves, so one good
angel invested with God's authority is able to drive away a thousand
evil angels, devils: they are an exceeding strong and potent people.
Second. As they are an exceeding strong and potent people, so they are a
very knowing and a wise people; and who so fit to manage the affairs and
concerns of the saints and people of God, and to protect and defend
them, as a knowing and understanding people? You know what Joab said to
David; "Thou art for wisdom as an angel of God." Says our Saviour, "No
man knoweth that day and time, no, not the angels in heaven;" as if the
angels in heaven knew every secret and were acquainted with every hidden
thing: they are an exceeding knowing people, very prudent and very wise.
Third. As they are an exceeding knowing and wise people, so they are
also exceeding active and expeditious, quick in despatches. Who more fit
to protect and defend the saints and people of God, than those that are
active, expedite, and quick in their despatches? such are the angels. In
the first of Ezekiel ye read that every one had four wings; why? because
of their great activity and expedition, and the quick despatch they make
in all their affairs. Fourth. As they are an active and expeditious
people, so they are a people very faithful both to God and man; in the
[Psa 103:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#001.md) they are ready to do God's
will, and not only ready to fulfil God's will, but they do it: "Bless
the Lord all ye his angels that excel in strength ([Psa
103:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#020).md), that do his commandments,
hearkening unto the voice of his word. Bless ye the Lord, all ye his
hosts, ye ministers of his that do his pleasure." They are very
faithful; and who so fit to do the work, to attend and look to the
concernments of the saints and people of God, as those that are
faithful? Fifth. As they are an exceeding faithful people, so they are a
people that are very loving to the saints and children of God, very
loving; otherwise they were not fit to be their nurses: what is a nurse
without love? They are loving to the saints. "Do it not," (said the
angel unto John), "I am thy fellow-servant;" do not give divine worship
to me, I am thy fellow-servant; fellow-servants are loving to one
another; they are fellow-servants with the saints. It is recorded of
Alexander that being in great danger and to fight next day with his
enemies, he slept very soundly the night before; and he being asked the
reason thereof, said, Parmenio wakes; meaning a great and faithful
captain of his; Parmenio wakes, says he. The angels are called watchmen;
they watch and are faithful, therefore you may be secure, quiet, and at
rest: trust in the Lord for ever, upon this account, in this day trust
in the Lord.

If these things be so, then, friends, why should we not stoop to any
work commanded, though it lie much beneath us? Do not you think that the
attending upon a sick man, a man that hath a plague sore running upon
him, is a work that lies much beneath angels? yet the angels do it
because it is commanded, though much beneath them yet they stoop to it
because it is commanded: and what though a work lie much beneath you,
yet if it be commanded, why should you not stoop to it? You will say,
Such an one is much beneath me, I will not lay my hand under his shoes,
he is much beneath me; ah, but the angels lay their hands under your
shoes, and the work they do for you is much beneath them: why should we
not be like our attendants? This is angelical obedience; the angels do
you many a kindness, and never look for thanks from you, they do many a
kindness that you are not aware of, why are you delivered sometimes you
know not how? here is a hand under a wing, the ministration of angels is
the cause of it. But I say the work they stoop to for you is much
beneath them, and therefore why should we not stoop to any work
commanded, though it lie much beneath us? - William Bridge.

[Psa 91:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011.md)

"He shall give his angels charge over thee," etc. When Satan tempted
Christ in the wilderness, he alleged but one sentence of Scripture for
himself, [Mat 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#006.md), and that Psalm out
of which he borrowed it made so plain against him, that he was fain to
pick here a word and there a word, and leave out that which went before,
and skip in the midst, and omit that which came after, or else he had
marred his cause. The Scripture is so holy, and pure, and true, that no
word nor syllable thereof can make for the Devil, or for sinners, or for
heretics: yet, as the Devil alleged Scripture, though it made not for
him, but against him, so do the libertines, and epicures, and heretics,
as though they had learned at his school. - Henry Smith.

[Psa 91:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011.md)

One angel armed with the power and glory of God is stronger than a whole
country. Earthly princes are subject to many changes and great unsurety
of life and estate. The reason is, their enemies may kill their watch,
and corrupt their guard. But what men or kingdoms can touch the Church's
watch? what angels of gold are able to corrupt the angels of God? and
then how can that perish that is committed to keepers so mighty and
faithful? Secondly, the charge of us is given to those ministering
spirits by parcels, not in gross and piece-meal, not in a lump: our
members in a book, our hairs by tale and number. For it is upon record,
and, as it were, delivered to them in writing in one Psalm, They keep
all our bones, [Psa 34:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#020.md); in this,
they keep our very foot, putting it in security ([Psa
91:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#012).md); and elsewhere our whole man
and every member. And can a charge so precisely and so particularly
given and taken, be neglected? Thirdly, their manner of keeping us, as
it is set down in the text, cannot but promise great assurance; for, is
not the little child safe while the nurse carrieth it in her arms, or
beareth it in her hands? So while these nurses so bear us, can we be in
danger? but our nurses on earth may fall; these nurses, the angels,
cannot. - Robert Horn.

[Psa 91:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011.md)

"His angels." Taking the word angel in its literal meaning, as
messenger, we may look upon any agency which God employs to strengthen,
protect, and help us, as his angel to us. - Mary B. M. Duncan.

[Psa 91:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011.md)

"To keep thee in all thy ways." How should those heavenly spirits bear
that man in their arms, like nurses, upon earth living; or bear up his
soul to heaven, like winged porters, when he dies, that refuseth the
right way? They shall keep us in all our ways. Out of the way it is
their charge to oppose us, as to preserve us in the way. Nor is this
more a terror to the ungodly, than to the righteous a comfort. For if an
angel would keep even a Balaam from sinning, how much more careful are
all those glorious powers to prevent the miscarriages of God's children!
From how many falls and bruises have they saved us! In how many
inclinations to evil have they turned us, either by removing occasions,
or by casting in secretly good motions! We sin too often, and should
catch many more falls, if those holy guardians did not uphold us. Satan
is ready to divert us, when we endeavour to do well; when to do ill,
angels are as ready to prevent us. We are in Joshua the high-priest's
case, with Satan on the one hand, on the other an angel, [Zac
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001.md) : without this, our danger were
greater than our defence, and we could neither stand nor rise. - Thomas
Adams.

[Psa 91:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011.md)

"To keep thee in all thy ways." Their commission, large as it is,
reaches no further: when you leave that, you lose your guard; but while
you keep your way, angels, yea, the God of angels, will keep you. Do not
so much fear losing your estate or your liberty or your lives, as losing
your way, and leaving your way: fear that more than anything; nothing
but sin exposeth you to misery. So long as you keep your way, you shall
keep other things; or if you lose any of them, you shall get what is
better: though you may be sufferers for Christ you shall not be losers
by him. - Samuel Slater ( - 1704), in "Morning Exercises."

[Psa 91:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011.md)

"In all thy ways." Your ways are God's ways, your way is the way
commanded by God. If you be out of God's ways, you are out of your own
way: if you be in your way, the angels shall keep you, even in the time
of a plague, and bear you up in their hands that you dash not your foot
against a stone; but if you be out of your way, I will not insure your
safety. When Balaam went upon the devil's errand an angel met him and
scared his ass, and the ass ran his foot against the wall, dashed his
foot against the wall. The promise is, "Thou shalt not dash thy foot
against a stone"; but he was out of his way, and the angel met him and
scared his ass, and his ass made him rush his leg against the wall.
Jonah went out of his way when he ran away from God; God bade him go one
way, and he went another. Well, what then? were the angels with him for
his protection? the very sea would not be quiet till he was thrown
overboard: instead of angels to protect him, he had a whale to devour
him. I confess indeed, through the free grace and mercy of God, the
belly of destruction was made a chamber of preservation to him, but he
was out of his way; and instead of an angel to keep him that he dash not
his foot his whole body was thrown overboard. Says Solomon. "As a bird
from her nest, so is a man out of his place": so long as the bird is in
her nest it is free from the hawk, it is free from the birding-piece, it
is free from the nets and gins and snares as long as it is in its nest;
but when the bird is off her nest then she is exposed to many dangers.
So, so long as a man is in his way, in his place and in his way, he is
well and under protection; but when a man is off his nest, out of his
place and out of his way, then is he exposed to all dangers: but be but
in your way and then you may assure yourselves of divine protection, and
of the management thereof by the hands of angels. Oh who would not
labour always to be in that way which God hath appointed him to be in?
Why should we not always consider with ourselves and say, But am I in my
way? Old Mr. Dod being upon the water and going out of one boat into
another, slipped between them, and the first word he spake was this, "Am
I in my way?" so we should always be saying, But am I in my way? am I in
my way? I am now idling away my time, but am I in my way? Oh my soul, am
I in my way? I am in my calling this day without prayer in the morning
and reading the Scriptures; but am I in my way? Oh my soul, am I in my
way? I am now in such frothy company where I get no good, but hurt; but
am I in my way? Ever consider this, Am I in my way? You may expect the
Lord's protection and the angels' attendance, if you be in your way, but
not else. - William Bridge.

[Psa 91:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011.md)

We have the safeguard of the empire; not only the protection of the
King, from which the wicked as outlaws are secluded; but also the
keeping of angels, to whom he hath given a charge over us, to keep us in
all his ways. So nearly we participate of his divine things, that we
have his own guard royal to attend us. - Thomas Adams.

[Psa 91:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011.md)

"He shall give his angels charge over thee," etc.

And is there care in heaven, and is there love

In heavenly spirits to these creatures base,

That may compassion of their evils move?

There is, else much more wretched were the race

Of men than beasts. But oh, the exceeding grace

Of highest God, that loves his creatures so,

And all his works with mercy doth embrace,

That blessed angels he sends to and fro,

To serve us wicked men, to serve his wicked foe!

How oft do they their silver bowers leave,

To come to succour us that succour want!

How oft do they with golden pinions cleave

The flitting skies, like flying pursuivant,

Against foul fiends to aid us militant!

They for us fight, they watch and duly ward,

And their bright squadrons round about us plant;

And all for love and nothing for reward.

Oh, why should heavenly God to man have such regard!

\- Edmund Spenser, 1552-1599.

[Psa 91:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011.md), [Psa
91:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#012.md)

It is observable that Scripture is the weapon that Satan doth desire to
wield against Christ. In his other ways of dealing he was shy, and did
but lay them in Christ's way, offering only the occasion, and leaving
him to take them up; but in this he is more confident, and industriously
pleads it as a thing which he could better stand to and more confidently
avouch. The care of his subtlety herein, lay in the misrepresentation
and abuse of it, as may be seen in these particulars,

\(1\) In that he urged this promise to promote a sinful thing, contrary
to the general end of all Scripture, which was therefore written 'that
we sin not.'

\(2\) But more especially in his clipping and mutilating of it. He
industriously leaves out that part of it which doth limit and confine
the promise of protection to lawful undertakings, such as this was not,
and renders it as a general promise of absolute safety, be the action
what it will, It is a citation from [Psa
91:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011.md), [Psa
91:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#012.md) which there runs thus, "He shall
give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways." These
last words, "in all thy ways," which doth direct to a true understanding
of God's intention in that promise, he deceitfully leaves out, as if
they were needless and unnecessary parts of the promise, when indeed
they were on purpose put there by the Spirit of God, to give a
description of those persons and actions, unto whom, in such cases, the
accomplishment of the promise might be expected; for albeit the word in
the original, which is translated "ways," - דּרכים - doth signify any
kind of way or action in the general, yet in this place it doth not; for
then God were engaged to an absolute protection of men, not only when
they unnecessarily thrust-themselves into dangers, but in the most
abominably sinful actions whatsoever, which would have been a direct
contradiction to those many scriptures wherein God threatens to withdraw
his hand and leave sinners to the danger of their iniquities; but it is
evident that the sense of it is no more than this, God is with you,
while you are with him. We have a paraphrase of this text, to this
purpose, in [Pro 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#023.md), "Then shalt
thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble;" where the
condition of this safety, pointed to in the word "then," which leads the
promise, is expressly mentioned in the foregoing verses, "My son, let
them" - that is, the precepts of wisdom - not depart from thine eyes ...
Then - not upon other terms - "shalt thou walk in thy way safely." The
"ways" then in this promise cited by Satan, are the ways of duty, or the
ways of our lawful callings. The fallacy of Satan in this dealing with
Scripture is obvious, and Christ might have given this answer, as
Bernard hath it, That God promiseth to keep him in his ways, but not in
self-created dangers, for that was not his way, but his ruin; or if a
way, it was Satan's way, but not his.

\(3\) To these two, some add another abuse, in a subtle concealment of
[Psa 91:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#013.md) in Ps. 91: "Thou shalt
tread upon the lion and adder." This concerned Satan, whose cruelty and
poisonous deceits were fitly represented by the lion and the adder, and
there the promise is also explained to have a respect to Satan's
temptations - that is - God would so manage his protection, that his
children should not be led into a snare. - Richard Gilpin.

[Psa 91:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011.md), [Psa
91:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#012.md)

There is, to my mind, a very remarkable coincidence of expression
between the verses of this Psalm, about the office of God's angels, and
that passage in Isaiah where Christ's sympathy and presence receive the
same charge attributed to them without interposition. In [Isa
63:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#009.md), we read, "In all their
affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them."
And again, "They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy
foot against a stone," compared with, "And he bare them; and he carried
them all the days of old." Christ in us, by sympathy with our nature -
Christ in us, by the indwelling of his Spirit in each individual heart -
thus he knows all our needs. Christ with us, in every step, all-powerful
to make all work for good, and with love and pity watching over our
interests - thus his presence saves us, and all things are made his
messengers to us. - Mary B. M. Duncan.

[Psa 91:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#012.md)

"Angels ... shall bear thee up ... lest thou dash thy foot against a
stone." Angels are introduced as bearing up the believer in their hands,
not that he may be carried in safety over some vast ocean, not that he
may be transported through hostile and menacing squadrons, not that,
when exposed to some extraordinary danger, he may be conveyed to a place
of refuge, but, as bearing him up in their arms, "lest at any time he
hurt his foot against a stone."... Angels, the topmost beings in
creation, the radiant, the magnificent, the powerful - angels are
represented as holding up a righteous man, lest some pebble in the path
should make him trip, lest he hurt his foot against a stone.

Is there, after all, any want of keeping between the agency and the act,
so that there is even the appearance of angels being unworthily
employed, employed on what is beneath them, when engaged in bearing us
up, lest at any time we hurt the foot against a stone? Nay, the hurting
the foot against a stone has often laid the foundation of fatal bodily
disease, the injury which seemed too trifling to be worth notice has
produced extreme sickness, and ended in death. Is it different in
spiritual respects, in regard of the soul, to which the promise in our
text must be specially applied? Not a jot. Or, if there be a difference,
it is only that the peril to the soul from a slight injury is far
greater than that to the body, the worst spiritual diseases might
commonly be traced to inconsiderable beginnings....

It can be no easy thing, this keeping the foot from being hurt against a
stone, seeing that the highest of created beings are commissioned to
effect it. Neither is it. The difficulty in religion is the taking up
the cross "daily," rather than the taking it up on some set occasion,
and under extraordinary circumstances. The serving God in little things,
the carrying religious principle into the details of life, the
discipline of our tempers, the regulation of our speech, the domestic
Christianity, the momentary sacrifices, the secret and unobserved
self-denials; who that knows anything of the difficulties of piety, does
not know that there is greater danger of his failing in these than in
trials of apparently far higher cost, and harder endurance; if on no
other account, yet because the very absence of what looks important, or
arduous, is likely to throw him off his guard, make him careless or
confident, and thereby almost insure defect or defeat? - Henry Melvill.

[Psa 91:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#012.md)

To carry them in their hands is a metaphor, and signifies a perfect
execution of their custody, to have a special care of them, and
therefore is rather expressed so, than carrying them on their shoulders.
That which one carries on their hand they are sure to keep. The
Spaniards have a proverb when they would signify eminent favour and
friendship, 'they carry him upon the palms of their hands,' that is,
they exceedingly love him, and diligently keep him. "Lest thou dash thy
foot against a stone." He persists in the metaphor: children often
stumble and fall, unless they be led and carried in hands and arms. By
stones are meant all difficulties, objections, perils, both to the
outward and inward man, as Christ is said to take care of hairs and
sparrows, that is, of every thing even to a hair. Now we know what this
charge is, saving that Zanchy adds also the metaphor of schoolmasters,
and says that we are poor rustic people, strangers; but being adopted
into the household of God, he gives his most noble ministers, the
angels, charge, first of our nursing, and then of our education; when we
are weaned, to instruct us, to admonish, to institute, to correct us, to
comfort us, to defend us, to preserve us from all evil, and to provoke
us to all good. And these angels, seeing we are so dear to God, that for
our sakes he spared not his own Son, take this charge with all their
hearts upon them, and omit nothing of their duty from our birth to the
end of our life. - Henry Lawrence, in "A Treatise of our Communion and
Warre with Angells," 1646.

[Psa 91:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#013.md)

"Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder, the young lion and the
dragon, shalt thou trample under feet." What avails a human foot among
these? What force of human affection can stand fast among such terrible
monsters? These are spiritual wickednesses, and are designated by not
incongruous titles One is an asp, another a basilisk, a third a lion,
and a fourth a dragon, because each in his own invisible way variously
wounds, - one by his bite, another by his look, a third by his roar or
blow, and a fourth by his breath...

Consider this also, whether perchance we are able to meet these four
temptations with four virtues. The lion roars, who will not fear? If any
there be, he shall be brave. But when the lion is foiled, the dragon
lurks in the sand, in order to excite the soul with his poisonous
breath; breathing therein the lust of earthly things. Who, think you,
shall escape his wiles? None but the prudent. But perhaps whilst you are
careful in attacking these, some annoyance vexes you; and lo! the asp is
upon you forthwith. For he seems to have found for himself a reasonable
moment. Who is he that shall not be exasperated by this asp? Certainly
the man of temperance and modesty, who knows how to abound, and to
suffer want. On this opportunity, I think, the Evil Eye with its wicked
allurements may determine to fascinate thee. Who shall turn away his
face? Truly the just man, who not only desires not to take to himself
the glory due to God, but not even to receive what is presented by
another: if yet he is a just man, that justly executes what is Just, who
performs not his righteousness before men, who, lastly, although he is
Just, lifts not up his head. For this virtue consists specially in
humility. This purifies the intention, this also obtains merit all the
more truly and effectually, because it arrogates less to itself. -
Bernard.

[Psa 91:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#013.md)

"Adder." The pethen is classed with the lion as being equally to be
dreaded by the traveller There is no doubt that the Egyptian cobra is
the pethen of Scripture. - J. G. Wood.

[Psa 91:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#013.md)

"Dragon." The expression is used (1) for "sea-monsters," (2) for
serpents, (3) for wild beasts or birds characteristic of desolate
places, and (4) it is used figuratively to represent the enemies of the
Lord, and especially Pharaoh, as head and representative of the Egyptian
power, and Nebuchadnezzar, the head and representative of the Chaldean
monarchy. The term is thus a general one, signifying any monstrous
creature, whether of the land or of the water, and is to be set down
with the one or the other, according as the context indicates. - John
Duns, in "Biblical Natural Science."

[Psa 91:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#013.md)

"Thou shalt tread upon;" "thou shalt trample under feet." Thou shalt
tread upon them, not accidentally, as a man treads upon an adder or a
serpent in the way; but his meaning is, thou shalt intentionally tread
upon them like a conqueror, thou shalt tread upon them to testify the
dominion over them, so when the Lord Jesus gave that promise ([Luk
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#019).md) to his disciples, that they
should do great things, he saith, You shall tread upon serpents; that
is, you shall have power to overcome whatsoever may annoy you,
serpentine power is all hurtful power, whether literal or mystical. As
the Apostle assures all believers ([Rom
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#020).md), "God shall tread down Satan
(that old serpent) under your feet shortly." - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 91:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#013) (second clause.md)

But what is said unto Christ? "And thou shalt tread on the lion and
dragon." Lion, for overt wrath; dragon for covert lurking. - Augustine.

[Psa 91:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#014.md)

"Because he hath set his love upon me." Vulg. "Because he hath hoped in
me." Whatever is to be done, whatever is to be declined, whatever is to
be endured, whatever is to be chosen, thou O Lord art my hope. This is
the only cause of all my promises, this the sole reason of my
expectation. Let another pretend to merit, let him boast that he bears
the burden and heat of the day, let him say that he fasts twice on the
Sabbath, let him finally glory that he is not as other men; for me it is
good to cleave unto God, to place my hope in the Lord God. Let others
hope in other things, one in his knowledge of letters, another in his
worldly-wisdom, one in his nobility, one in his dignity, another in some
other vanity, for thy sake I have made all things loss, and count them
but dung; since thou, Lord, art my hope. - Bernard, quoted by Le Blanc.

[Psa 91:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#014) (first clause.md)

As there is a because and a therefore in the process of the law, in
concluding death for sin, so there is a because and a therefore in the
process of grace, and of the gospel, which doth reason from one grace
given to infer another grace to be given, even grace for grace; and such
is this here: "Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I
deliver him." - David Dickson.

[Psa 91:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#014.md)

He does not say, Because he is without sin, because he has perfectly
kept all my precepts, because he has merit and is worthy to be delivered
and guarded. But he produces those qualities which are even found in the
weak, the imperfect, and those still exposed to sin in the flesh,
namely, adhesion, knowledge of his name, and prayer. - Musculus.

[Psa 91:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#014.md)

"He hath set his love upon me." In the love of a divinely illuminated
believer there is

\(1\) the sweet property of gratitude. The soul has just and enlarged
views of the salvation which he has obtained through the name of Jesus.
The evils from which he is saved; the blessings in hand, and the
blessings in hope; the salvation in time, and the salvation through
eternity, which can and shall be enjoyed through the name of Jesus,
excites feelings of the most ardent gratitude in the soul of the
Christian.

\(2\) Another delightful ingredient in this settled love is, admiration.
Everything in the scheme and execution of God's redeeming plan is an
object of admiration. All that the Lord Jesus is in himself; all that he
has done; all that he does at the present; and all that he has promised
to do for his people, deserves the warmest admiration. This holy feeling
is experienced in the breast of the man to whom the Lord can say, "He
hath set his love upon me."

\(3\) Another ingredient in the illuminated love of the believer is
delightful complacency. Nothing can afford complacent delight in any
excellency unless we are persuaded that we either do possess, or may
possess it. I may go to the palace of the greatest monarch in the world,
and be deeply struck with astonishment and admiration at the wonder
beheld, but there will not be one thrill of complacency felt in my bosom
at the view of the astonishing objects which crowd upon my vision. Why?
Because I neither have, nor can have any interest in them; they are not
mine, nor ever can be; therefore, I cannot take complacent delight in
them. But the love of the Christian is a delightful love, (as Mr. Baxter
called it,) because there is in the Lord everything that is worthy of
infinite and eternal admiration; and then there is the thought which
produces a thrill of pleasure, - whatever I admire I can, in some
measure, possess. The illuminated eye of God's favourite sees everything
in the Lord to supply his necessities; everything to satisfy his
desires, all his own; which makes the soul delight itself in the Lord,
and he rests in his love. Therefore, the Lord says of the object of his
lovingkindness, "He hath set his love upon me" - he hath renounced sin
as the greatest abomination; he hath taken off the heart from all
idolatrous attachment to the creature, and placed it fixedly and
supremely upon God. - William Dawson, Methodist Preacher (1773-1841).

[Psa 91:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#014.md)

"He hath set his love upon me." We have a similar expression in daily
use, which means the bending of all our energies to one end - a
ceaseless effort after one object. We say, "I have set my heart on such
a thing." This is what God will have from us - an intense,
single-hearted love. We must love him "with all our heart, and with all
our soul, and with all our strength, and with all our mind," so that,
like Jesus, we may "delight to do his will." Just let us think of the
way in which setting our heart on anything affects us, head, hands,
time, thought, action - all are at work for its attainment. How we
sacrifice everything else to ill Comfort, ease, present advantage,
money, health, nay, our very selves, go freely for the sake of our
cherished wish.

Have I so "set my heart upon" God? Temperaments differ. This may be an
overdrawn picture of the way in Which some of us seek a cherished
object. But each knows his own capability in this way. God also knows
our frame, and requires his best at every man's hand.

There is one thing in this verse which may encourage us very much. It is
not because of perfect love that God will deliver. It is to the will to
love and serve - it is to the setting the heart, that the promise is
made - to the "full purpose of heart" that is set to cleave unto the
Lord. - Mary B. M. Duncan.

[Psa 91:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#014.md)

"I will set him on high." That is, in an inaccessible, or lofty place, I
will set him, which means, I will deliver him. When men truly know God
to be a deliverer, they both put confidence in him, and call upon him.
Then God exalts and delivers him that calls. - Franciscus Vatablus.

[Psa 91:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#014.md)

"I will set him on high, because he hath known my name." There is a
great deal of safety in the knowledge of God, in his attributes, and in
his Christ. A man's safety we see lies in his running to the tower ([Pro
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#010).md); he runs and is safe. And it is
the knowledge of this tower that sets a man a running to it. Hence we
find safety attributed to the knowledge of the Lord. "I will set him on
high," I will exalt him, and so he shall be safe. Why so? "Because he
hath known my name": for the knowing of God aright was that which made
him run, and so he is exalted and set on high. Then a man is safe when
he hath got this tower to be his tower, when he hath gotten God to be
his God. Now when we know God, we get him to be our God, and make this
tower our tower, [Jer 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#007.md) : "I will
give them an heart to know me, and I will be their God." - Jeremiah
Dyke, in "The Righteous Man's Tower," 1639.

[Psa 91:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#014.md)

"He hath known my name." From this text I would introduce to your notice
the most desirable character under the sun; and I would exhibit him
before you to excite each one to seek, until you obtain the same
blessedness. The character that I shall exhibit is God's Favourite, one
who is an object of the "lovingkindness of the Lord"; and in reading
this passage there are two things which strike our attention concerning
such a character. First, what the Lord says of him. Second, what the
Lord says to him.

Now, then, my brethren - Look! There stands before you God's Favourite!

I. Listen to what God says of him.

1\. He says of him, "He knows my name." The first principle of the life
of God in the fallen soul of man is knowledge; spiritual, divine
knowledge. The first operation of the Holy Ghost in the work of
salvation, is a conviction of the character and perfections and
relations of God. The Lord says, "he knows my name." He knows my name as
Omniscient, Omnipresent, Holy, Just and True.

\(1\) He first knows my name as a sin-hating, sin-avenging God; and this
knowledge was a means of leading him to a deep sense of his own personal
corruption, guilt, and danger as a sinner.

\(2\) But the favourite of the Lord knows his name as revealed to Moses,
as "The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and
abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving
iniquity, and transgression, and sin." He knows the name of the Lord as
concentrated in the name of Jesus, who "shall save his people from their
sins." By the while beams of God's holiness, (if I may so speak), the
sinner sees his corruption, guilt and deformity: by the red beams of
God's justice he sees his unspeakable danger: by the mild beams of God's
mercy, he discovers a ground of hope - that there is pardon for his
aggravated crimes. But it is in the face of our Lord Jesus Christ, that
God appears most delightful. Hence we can say to every saved soul, as
Paul did to the Corinthians: - "God, who commanded the light to shine
out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the
knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ." As all the
colours of the rainbow meet in one sunbeam, so all the perfections of
God as perfectly unite, and more beautifully shine forth, in the person
and offices of Jesus Christ, upon the soul of the penitent believer.
This saving knowledge is always vital, active, and powerful. - William
Dawson.

[Psa 91:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#014.md)

"He hath known my name." May we not get some light on this expression
from the custom of the Jews, keeping the name Jehovah sacred to their
own use, regarding it as too holy even to be pronounced by them in
common use, and thus preserving it-from being taken in vain by the
heathen around? Thus it was known to Jews only.... But whatever be the
origin of the expressions, to "know his name," to "trust in his name,"
to "believe in his name," it evidently in all these cases means whatever
is revealed concerning him - all that by which he maketh himself known.
His Word, his Providence, above all, his Son, are included thus in his
name, which we must know, believe in, and trust. So that to "know his
name" is to know himself, as revealed in the Gospel. - Mary B. M.
Duncan.

[Psa 91:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#014) (last clause.md)

Sound love to God, floweth from and is joined with sound knowledge of
God, as his Majesty is declared unto us in Scripture, the believer who
hath set his lope upon God, "hath known my name," saith he. - David
Dickson.

[Psa 91:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#015.md)

"I will answer him." I think we sometimes discourage ourselves by a
misconception of the exact meaning of the expression, "answer," taking
it to mean only grant. Now, an answer is not necessarily an
acquiescence. It may be a refusal, an explanation, a promise, a
conditional grant. It is, in fact, simply attention to our request
expressed. In this sense, before we call he will answer, and while we
are yet speaking he will hear, [Isa
65:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#024.md). - Mary B. M. Duncan.

[Psa 91:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#015.md)

"I will be with him in trouble." I will be with him in trouble, says
God: and shall I seek meanwhile anything else than trouble? It is good
for me to cleave unto God. Not only so, but also to put my hope in the
Lord: because I will deliver him, he says, and honour him. I will be
with him in trouble. My delights, he says, are with the sons of men.
Emanuel God with us. Hail, thou art highly favoured, says the Angel to
Mary, the Lord is with thee. In the fulness of grace he is with us, in
the plentitude of glory we shall be with him. He descends in order to be
near to those who are of a troubled heart, that he may be with us in our
trouble... It is better for me, O Lord, to be troubled, whilst only thou
art with me, than to reign without thee, to feast without thee, to be
honoured without thee. It is good rather to be embraced by thee in
trouble, to have thee in this furnace with me, than to be without thee
even in heaven. For what have I in heaven, and without thee what do I
desire upon earth? The furnace tries the gold, and the temptation of
trouble just men. - Bernard.

[Psa 91:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#015.md)

"I will be with him in trouble." God hath made promises of his special
presence with his saints in suffering. If we have such a friend to visit
us in prison, we shall do well enough; though we change our place, we
shall not change our keeper. "I will be with him." God will hold our
head and heart when we are fainting! What if we have more afflictions
than others, if we have more of God's company? God's honour is dear to
him; it would not be for his honour to bring his children into
sufferings, and leave them there; he will be with them to animate and
support them; yea, when new troubles arise. [Job
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#019.md). "He shall deliver thee in six
troubles." - Thomas Watson.

[Psa 91:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#015.md)

"I will be with him in trouble." Again God speaks and acts like a
tender-hearted mother towards a sickly child. When the child is in
perfect health she can leave it in the hands of the nurse; but when it
is sick she will attend it herself; she will say to the nurse, "You may
attend a while to some other business, I will watch over the child
myself." She hears the slightest moan; she flies to the cradle; she
takes it in her arms; she kisses its lips, and drops a tear upon its
face, and asks, "What can I do for thee, my child? How can I relieve thy
pain and soften thy sufferings? Don't weep and break my heart; it is thy
mother's arms that are around thee; it is thy mother's lap on which thou
art laid; it is thy mother's voice that speaks to thee; it is thy mother
that is with thee; fear not." So the Lord speaks to his afflicted
children. "I will be with him in trouble." No mother can equally
sympathise with her suffering child; as the Lord does with his suffering
people. No I could all the love that ever dwelt in all the mothers'
hearts that ever existed, be united in one mother's heart, and fixed on
her only child, it would no more bear a comparison with the love of God
to his people than the summer midnight glow-worm is to be compared to
the summer mid-day sun.

Oh, that delightful sentence I "I will be with him in trouble." At other
times, God will leave them in the hands of angels: "I will give them
charge over them to keep them in all their ways; they bear them up lest
at any time they dash their feet against a stone." But when they are in
trouble, I will say to the angels, "Stand aside, I will take care of
them myself." "I will be with them in trouble." So he speaks to his
people, "When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and
through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee, when thou walkest
through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame
kindle upon thee. For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy
Saviour." When languishing in sickness, he will make his bed, and his
pillow; when travelling through the valley of the shadow of death, the
Lord will be with him, and enable him to sing, "I will fear no evil, for
thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me." Thus he is
with them as their physician and nurse, in pain and sickness; as their
strength in weakness; as their guide in difficulty; their ease in pain;
and as their life in death, "I will be with him in trouble." - William
Dawson.

[Psa 91:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#016.md)

"With long life will I satisfy him." Saint Bernard interprets this of
heaven; because he thought nothing long that had an end. This, indeed,
is the emphasis of heaven's joy; those blessed souls never sin, never
weep more; they shall not only be with the Lord, but ever with the Lord.
This is the accent which is set on the eulogies given to heaven in
Scripture. 'Tis "an inheritance," and that an "incorruptible one, that
fadeth not away;" it is "a crown of glory," and that a weighty one, yea,
"an exceeding great and eternal weight of glory." When once it is on the
saint's head it can never fall, or be snatched off; it is a feast, but
such a one that hath a sitting down to it but no rising up from it. -
William Gurnall.

[Psa 91:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#016.md)

"With long life will I satisfy him." Observe the joyful contrast here to
the mournful words in the foregoing Psalm. "We spend our years as a tale
that is told. The days of our years are threescore years and ten," ([Psa
90:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#009.md), [Psa
90:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#010)..md) The life of Israel in the
wilderness was shortened by Disobedience. The Obedience of Christ in the
wilderness has won for us a blessed immortality. - Christopher
Wordsworth.

[Psa 91:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#016.md)

"With long life will I satisfy him," etc. The margin here is length of
days; that is, days lengthened out or multiplied. The meaning is, I will
give him length of days as he desires, or until he is satisfied with
life; - implying

\(1\) that it is natural to desire long life;

\(2\) that long life is to be regarded as a blessing (comp. [Pro
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#002.md), [Pro
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#016.md); [Exo
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#012).md);

\(3\) that the tendency of religion is to lengthen out life; since
virtue, temperance, regular industry, calmness of mind, moderation in
all things, freedom from excesses in eating and drinking, - to all of
which religion prompts, - contribute to health and to length of days;
and

\(4\) that a time will come, even under this promised blessing of length
of days, when a man will be "satisfied" with living; when he will have
no strong desire to live longer; when, under the infirmities of advanced
years, and under his lonely feelings from the fact that his early
friends have fallen, and under the influence of a bright hope of heaven,
he will feel that he has had enough of life here, and that it is better
to depart to another world. "And shew him my salvation." In another
life, after he shall be satisfied with this life. - Albert Barnes.

[Psa 91:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#016.md)

"With long life will I satisfy him." This promise concerning length of
life contains a gift of God by no means to be despised. Many enemies
indeed will plot against his life, and desire to extinguish him as
suddenly and as quickly as possible; but I shall so guard him that he
shall live to a good old age and be filled with years, and desire to
depart from life. - J. B. Folengius.

[Psa 91:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#016.md)

"With long life will I satisfy him."

We live in deeds, not years; in thoughts, not breaths;

In feelings, not in figures on a dial.

We should count time by heart-throbs. He most lives

Who thinks most, feels the noblest, acts the best.

Philip James Bailey, in "Festus."

[Psa 91:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#016.md)

"Long life."

They err who measure life by years,

With false or thoughtless tongue;

Some hearts grow old before their time;

Others are always young.

'Tis not the number of the lines

On life's fast filling page,

'Tis not the pulse's added throbs,

Which constitute their age.

Some souls are serfs among the free

While others nobly thrive;

They stand just where their fathers stood

Dead, even while they live.

Others, all spirit, heart, and sense,

Theirs the mysterious power,

To live in thrills of joy or woe,

A twelvemonth in an hour!

Bryan W. Procter.

[Psa 91:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#016.md)

"Long life."

He liveth long who liveth well!

All other life is short and vain:

He liveth longest who can tell

Of living most for heavenly gain

He liveth long who liveth well!

All else is being flung away;

He liveth longest who can tell

Of true things truly done each day.

Horatius Bonar.

[Psa 91:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#016.md)

"I will shew him my salvation." The last, greatest, climax of blessing,
including and concluding all! What God does is, perfectly done. Hitherto
has his servant caught glimpses of the great salvation. The Spirit has
revealed step by step of it, as he was able to bear it. The Word has
taught him, and he has rejoiced in his light. But all was seen in part
and known in part. But when God has satisfied his servant with length of
days, and time for him is over, eternity begun, he will "shew him his
salvation." All will be plain. All will be known. God will be revealed
in his love and his glory. And we shall know all things, even as we are
known! - Mary B. M. Duncan.

[Psalms 91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 91:1</span></span>

1 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide
under the shadow of the Almighty.

2 I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in
him will I trust.

[Psa 91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md)

"He that dwelleth, in the secret place of the most High." The blessings
here promised are not for all believers, but for those who live in close
fellowship with God. Every child of God looks towards the inner
sanctuary and the mercy-seat, yet all do not dwell in the most holy
place; they run to it at times, and enjoy occasional approaches, but
they do not habitually reside in the mysterious presence. Those who
through rich grace obtain unusual and continuous communion with God, so
as to abide in Christ and Christ in them, become possessors of rare and
special benefits, which are missed by those who follow afar off, and
grieve the Holy Spirit of God. Into the secret place those only come who
know the love of God in Christ Jesus, and those only dwell there to whom
to live is Christ. To them the veil is rent, the mercy-seat is revealed,
the covering cherubs are manifest, and the awful glory of the Most High
is apparent: these, like Simeon, have the Holy Ghost upon them, and like
Anna they depart not from the temple; they are the courtiers of the
Great King, the valiant men who keep watch around the bed of Solomon,
the virgin souls who follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. Elect out
of the elect, they have "attained unto the first three," and shall walk
with their Lord in white, for they are worthy. Sitting down in the
august presence-chamber where shines the mystic light of the Sheckinah,
they know what it is to be raised up together, and to be made to sit
together with Christ in the heavenlies, and of them it is truly said
that their conversation is in heaven. Special grace like theirs brings
with it special immunity. Outer court worshippers little know what
belongs to the inner sanctuary, or surely they would press on until the
place of nearness and divine familiarity became theirs. Those who are
the Lord's constant guests shall find that he will never suffer any to
be injured within his gates; he has eaten the covenant salt with them,
and is pledged for their protection.

"Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty." The Omnipotent Lord will
shield all those who dwell with him, they shall remain under his care as
guests under the protection of their host. In the most holy place the
wings of the cherubim were the most conspicuous objects, and they
probably suggested to the Psalmist the expression here employed. Those
who commune with God are safe with him, no evil can reach them, for the
outstretched wings of his power and love cover them from all harm. This
protection is constant - they abide under it, and it is all-sufficient,
for it is the shadow of the Almighty, whose omnipotence will surely
screen them from all attack. No shelter can be imagined at all
comparable to the protection of Jehovah's own shadow. The Almighty
himself is where his shadow is, and hence those who dwell in his secret
place are shielded by himself. What a shade in the day of noxious heat!
What a refuge in the hour of deadly storm! Communion with God is safety.
The more closely we cling to our Almighty Father the more confident may
we be.

[Psa 91:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#002.md)

"I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress." To take up a
general truth and make it our own by personal faith is the highest
wisdom. It is but poor comfort to say 'the Lord is a refuge,' but to say
he is my refuge, is the essence of consolation. Those who believe should
also speak - "I will say," for such bold avowals honour God and lead
others to seek the same confidence. Men are apt enough to proclaim their
doubts, and even to boast of them, indeed there is a party nowadays of
the most audacious pretenders to culture and thought, who glory in
casting suspicion upon everything; hence it becomes the duty of all true
believers to speak out and testify with calm courage to their own
well-grounded reliance upon their God. Let others say what they will, be
it ours to say of the Lord, "he is our refuge." But what we say we must
prove by our actions, we must fly to the Lord for shelter, and not to an
arm of flesh. The bird flies away to the thicket, and the fox hastens to
its hole, every creature uses its refuge in the hour of danger, and even
so in all peril or fear of peril let us flee unto Jehovah, the Eternal
Protector of his own. Let us, when we are secure in the Lord, rejoice
that our position is unassailable, for he is our fortress as well as our
refuge. No moat, portcullis, drawbridge, wall, battlement and donjon,
could make us so secure as we are when the attributes of the Lord of
Hosts environ us around. Behold this day the Lord is to us instead of
walls and bulwarks! Our ramparts defy the leaguered hosts of hell. Foes
in flesh, and foes in ghostly guise are alike baulked of their prey when
the Lord of Hosts stands between us and their fury, and all other evil
forces are turned aside. Walls cannot keep out the pestilence, but the
Lord can.

As if it were not enough to call the Lord his refuge and fortress, he
adds, "My God I in him will I trust." Now he can say no more; "my God"
means all, and more than all, that heart can conceive by way of
security. It was most meet that he should say "in him will I trust,"
since to deny faith to such a one were wilful wickedness and wanton
insult. He who dwells in an impregnable fortress, naturally trusts in
it; and shall not he who dwells in God feel himself well at ease, and
repose his soul in safety? O that we more fully carried out the
Psalmist's resolve! We have trusted in God let us trust him still. He
has never failed us, why then should we suspect him? To trust in man is
natural to fallen nature, to trust in God should be as natural to
regenerated nature. Where there is every reason and warrant for faith,
we ought to place our confidence without hesitancy or wavering. Dear
reader, pray for grace to say, "In him will I trust."

[Psalms 91:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 91:3</span></span>

3 Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from
the noisome pestilence.

4 He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou
trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.

5 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow
that flieth by day;

6 Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the
destruction that wasteth at noonday.

7 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand;
but it shall not come nigh thee.

8 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the
wicked.

[Psa 91:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#003.md)

"Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler." Assuredly
no subtle plot shall succeed against one who has the eyes of God
watching for his defence. We are foolish and weak as poor little birds,
and are very apt to be lured to our destruction by cunning foes, but if
we dwell near to God, he will see to it that the most skilful deceiver
shall not entrap us.

"Satan the fowler who betrays

Unguarded souls a thousand ways,"

shall be foiled in the case of the man whose high and honourable
condition consists in residence within the holy place of the Most High.
"And from the noisome pestilence." He who is a Spirit can protect us
from evil spirits, he who is mysterious can rescue us from mysterious
dangers, he who is immortal can redeem us from mortal sickness. There is
a deadly pestilence of error, we are safe from that if we dwell in
communion with the God of truth; there is a fatal pestilence of sin, we
shall not be infected by it if we abide with the thrice Holy One; there
is also a pestilence of disease, and even from that calamity our faith
shall win immunity if it be of that high order which abides in God,
walks on in calm serenity, and ventures all things for duty's sake.
Faith by cheering the heart keeps it free from the fear which, in times
of pestilence, kills more than the plague itself. It will not in all
cases ward off disease and death, but where the man is such as [Psa
91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md) describes, it will assuredly
render him immortal where others die; if all the saints are not so
sheltered it is because they have not all such a close abiding with God,
and consequently not such confidence in the promise. Such special faith
is not given to all, for there are diversities in the measure of faith.
It is not of all believers that the Psalmist sings, but only of those
who dwell in the secret place of the Most High. Too many among us are
weak in faith, and in fact place more reliance in a phial or a globule
than in the Lord and giver of life, and if we die of pestilence as
others die it is because we acted like others, and did not in patience
possess our souls. The great mercy is that in such a case our deaths are
blessed, and it is well with us, for we are for ever with the Lord.
Pestilence to the saints shall not be noisome but the messenger of
heaven.

[Psa 91:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#004.md)

"He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou
trust." A wonderful expression! Had it been invented by an uninspired
man it would have verged upon blasphemy, for who should dare to apply
such words to the Infinite Jehovah? But as he himself authorised yea,
dictated the language, we have here a transcendent condescension, such
as it becomes us to admire and adore. Doth the Lord speak of his
feathers, as though he likened himself to a bird? Who will not see
herein a matchless love, a divine tenderness, which should both woo and
win our confidence? Even as a hen covereth her chickens so doth the Lord
protect the souls which dwell in him; let us cower down beneath him for
comfort and for safety. Hawks in the sky and snares in the field are
equally harmless when we nestle so near the Lord. "His truth" - his true
promise, and his faithfulness to his promise "shall be thy shield and
buckler." Double armour has he who relies upon the Lord. He bears a
shield and wears an all-surrounding coat of mail - such is the force of
the word "buckler." To quench fiery darts the truth is a most effectual
shield, and to blunt all swords it is an equally effectual coat of mail.
Let us go forth to battle thus harnessed for the war, and we shall be
safe in the thickest of the fight. It has been so, and so shall it be
till we reach the land of peace, and there among the "helmed cherubim
and sworded seraphim," we will wear no other ornament, his truth shall
still be our shield and buckler.

[Psa 91:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#005.md)

"Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night." Such frail creatures
are we that both by night and by day we are in danger, and so sinful are
we that in either season we may be readily carried away by fear; the
promise before us secures the favourite of heaven both from danger and
from the fear of it. Night is the congenial hour of horrors, when alarms
walk abroad like beasts of prey, or ghouls from among the tombs; our
fears turn the sweet season of repose into one of dread, and though
angels are abroad and fill our chambers, we dream of demons and dire
visitants from hell. Blessed is that communion with God which renders us
impervious to midnight frights, and horrors born of darkness. Not to be
afraid is in itself an unspeakable blessing, since for every suffering
which we endure from real injury we are tormented by a thousand griefs
which arise from fear only. The shadow of the Almighty removes all gloom
from the shadow of night: once covered by the divine wing, we care not
what winged terrors may fly abroad in the earth. "Nor for the arrow that
flieth by day." Cunning foes lie in ambuscade, and aim the deadly shaft
at our hearts, but we do not fear them, and have no cause to do so. That
arrow is not made which can destroy the righteous, for the Lord hath
said, "No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper." In times of
great danger those who have made the Lord their refuge, and therefore
have refused to use the carnal weapon, have been singularly preserved;
the annals of the Quakers bear good evidence to this; yet probably the
main thought is, that from the cowardly attacks of crafty malice those
who walk by faith shall be protected, from cunning heresies they shall
be preserved, and in sudden temptations they shall be secured from harm.
Day has its perils as well as night, arrows more deadly than those
poisoned by the Indian are flying noiselessly through the air, and we
shall be their victims unless we find both shield and buckler in our
God. O believer, dwell under the shadow of the Lord, and none of the
archers shall destroy thee, they may shoot at thee and wound thee
grievously, but thy bow shall abide in strength. When Satan's quiver
shall be empty thou shalt remain uninjured by his craft and cruelty,
yea, his broken darts shall be to thee as trophies of the truth and
power of the Lord thy God.

[Psa 91:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#006.md)

"Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness." It is shrouded in
mystery as to its cause and cure, it marches on, unseen of men, slaying
with hidden weapons, like an enemy stabbing in the dark, yet those who
dwell in God are not afraid of it. Nothing is more alarming than the
assassin's plot, for he may at any moment steal in upon a man, and lay
him low at a stroke; and such is the plague in the days of its power,
none can promise themselves freedom from it for an hour in any place in
the infected city; it enters a house men know not how, and its very
breath is mortal; yet those choice souls who dwell in God shall live
above fear in the most plague-stricken places - they shall not be afraid
of the "plagues which in the darkness walk." "Nor for the destruction
that wasteth at noonday." Famine may starve, or bloody war devour,
earthquake may overturn and tempest may smite, but amid all, the man who
has sought the mercy seat and is sheltered beneath the wings which
overshadow it, shall abide in perfect peace. Days of horror and nights
of terror are for other men, his days and nights are alike spent with
God, and therefore pass away in sacred quiet. His peace is not a thing
of times and seasons, it does not rise and set with the sun, nor does it
depend upon the healthiness of the atmosphere or the security of the
country. Upon the child of the Lord's own heart, pestilence has no
destroying power, and calamity no wasting influence: pestilence walks in
darkness, but he dwells in light; destruction wastes at noonday, but
upon him another sun has risen whose beams bring restoration. Remember
that the voice which saith "thou shalt not fear" is that of God himself,
who hereby pledges his word for the safety of those who abide under his
shadow, nay, not for their safety only, but for their serenity. So far
shall they be from being injured that they shall not even be made to
fear the ills which are around them, since the Lord protects them.

"He, his shadowy plumes outspread,

With his wing shall fence thy head:

And his truth around thee wield,

Strong as targe or bossy shield!

Naught shall strike thee with dismay,

Fear by night, nor shaft by day."

[Psa 91:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#007.md)

"A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand."
So terribly may the plague rage among men that the bills of mortality
may become very heavy and continue to grow ten times heavier still, yet
shall such as this Psalm speaks of survive the scythe of death. "It
shall not come nigh thee." It shall be so near as to be at thy side, and
yet not nigh enough to touch thee; like a fire it shall burn all around,
yet shall not the smell of it pass upon thee. How true is this of the
plague of moral evil, of heresy, and of backsliding. Whole nations are
infected, yet the man who communes with God is not affected by the
contagion; he holds the truth when falsehood is all the fashion.
Professors all around him are plague-smitten, the church is wasted, the
very life of religion decays, but in the same place and time, in
fellowship with God, the believer renews his youth, and his soul knows
no sickness. In a measure this also is true of physical evil; the Lord
still puts a difference between Israel and Egypt in the day of his
plagues. Sennacherib's army is blasted, but Jerusalem is in health.

"Our God his chosen people saves

Amongst the dead, amidst the graves."

[Psa 91:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#008.md)

"Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the
wicked." The sight shall reveal both the justice and the mercy of God;
in them that perish the severity of God will be manifest, and in the
believer's escape the richness of divine goodness will be apparent.
Joshua and Caleb verified this promise. The Puritan preachers during the
plague of London must have been much impressed with this verse as they
came out of their hiding-places to proclaim mercy and judgment to the
dissolute age which was so sorely visited with the pest. The sight of
God's judgments softens the heart, excites a solemn awe, creates
gratitude, and so stirs up the deepest kind of adoration. It is such a
sight as none of us would wish to see, and yet if we did see it we might
thus be lifted up to the very noblest style of manhood. Let us but watch
providence, and we shall find ourselves living in a school where
examples of the ultimate reward of sin are very plentiful. One case may
not be judged alone lest we misjudge, but instances of divine visitation
will be plentiful in the memory of any attentive observer of men and
things; from all these put together we may fairly draw conclusions, and
unless we shut our eyes to that which is self-evident, we shall soon
perceive that there is after all a moral ruler over the sons of men, who
sooner or later rewards the ungodly with due punishment.

[Psalms 91:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 91:9</span></span>

9 Because thou hast made the Lord which is my refuge, even the most
High, thy habitation;

10 There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh
thy dwelling.

[Psa 91:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#009.md), [Psa
91:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#010.md)

Before expounding these verses I cannot refrain from recording a
personal incident illustrating their power to soothe the heart, when
they are applied by the Holy Spirit. In the year 1854, when I had
scarcely been in London twelve months, the neighbourhood in which I
laboured was visited by Asiatic cholera, and my congregation suffered
from its inroads. Family after family summoned me to the bedside of the
smitten, and almost every day I was called to visit the grave. I gave
myself up with youthful ardour to the visitation of the sick, and was
sent for from all corners of the district by persons of all ranks and
religions. I became weary in body and sick at heart. My friends seemed
falling one by one, and I felt or fancied that I was sickening like
those around me. A little more work and weeping would have laid me low
among the rest; I felt that my burden was heavier than I could bear, and
I was ready to sink under it. As God would have it, I was returning
mournfully home from a funeral, when my curiosity led me to read a paper
which was wafered up in a shoemaker's window in the Dover Road. It did
not look like a trade announcement, nor was it, for it bore in a good
bold handwriting these words: - "Because thou hast made the Lord, which
is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation; there shall no evil
befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling." The
effect upon my heart was immediate. Faith appropriated the passage as
her own. I felt secure, refreshed, girt with immortality. I went on with
my visitation of the dying in a calm and peaceful spirit; I felt no fear
of evil, and I suffered no harm. The providence which moved the
tradesman to place those verses in his window I gratefully acknowledge,
and in the remembrance of its marvellous power I adore the Lord my God.

The Psalmist in these verses assures the man who dwells in God that he
shall be secure. Though faith claims no merit of its own, yet the Lord
rewards it wherever he sees it. He who makes God his refuge shall find
him a refuge; he who dwells in God shall find his dwelling protected. We
must make the Lord our habitation by choosing him for our trust and
rest, and then we shall receive immunity from harm; no evil shall touch
us personally, and no stroke of judgment shall assail or household. The
dwelling here intended by the original was only a tent, yet the frail
covering would prove to be a sufficient shelter from harm of all sorts.
It matters little whether our abode be a gipsy's hut or a monarch's
palace if the soul has made the Most High its habitation. Get into God
and you dwell in all good, and ill is banished far away. It is not
because we are perfect or highly esteemed among men that we can hope for
shelter in the day of evil, but because our refuge is the Eternal God,
and our faith has learned to hide beneath his sheltering wing.

"For this no ill thy cause shall daunt,

No scourge thy tabernacle haunt."

It is impossible that any ill should happen to the man who is beloved of
the Lord; the most crushing calamities can only shorten his journey and
hasten him to his reward. Ill to him is no ill, but only good in a
mysterious form. Losses enrich him, sickness is his medicine, reproach
is his honour, death is his gain. No evil in the strict sense of the
word can happen to him, for everything is overruled for good. Happy is
he who is in such a case. He is secure where others are in peril, he
lives where others die.

[Psalms 91:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 91:11</span></span>

11 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all
thy ways.

12 They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot
against a stone.

13 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the
dragon shalt thou trample under feet.

[Psa 91:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011.md)

"For he shall give his angels charge over thee." Not one guardian angel,
as some fondly dream, but all the angels are here alluded to. They are
the bodyguard of the princes of the blood imperial of heaven, and they
have received commission from their Lord and ours to watch carefully
over all the interests of the faithful. When men have a charge they
become doubly careful, and therefore the angels are represented as
bidden by God himself to see to it that the elect are secured. It is
down in the marching orders of the hosts of heaven that they take
special note of the people who dwell in God. It is not to be wondered at
that the servants are bidden to be careful of the comfort of their
Master's guests; and we may be quite sure that when they are specially
charged by the Lord himself they will carefully discharge the duty
imposed upon them. "To keep thee in all thy ways." To be a body-guard, a
garrison to the body, soul, and spirit of the saint. The limit of this
protection "in all thy ways" is yet no limit to the heart which is right
with God. It is not the way of the believer to go out of his way. He
keeps in the way, and then the angels keep him. The protection here
promised is exceeding broad as to place, for it refers to all our ways,
and what do we wish for more? How angels thus keep us we cannot tell.
Whether they repel demons, counteract spiritual plots, or even ward off
the subtler physical forces of disease, we do not know. Perhaps we shall
one day stand amazed at the multiplied services which the unseen bands
have rendered to us.

[Psa 91:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#012.md)

"They," that is the angels, God's own angels, shall cheerfully become
our servitors. "They shall bear thee up in their hands"; as nurses carry
little children, with careful love, so shall those glorious spirits
upbear each individual believer. "Lest thou dash thy foot against a
stone;" even minor ills they ward off. It is most desirable that we
should not stumble, but as the way is rough, it is most gracious on the
Lord's part to send his servants to bear us up above the loose pebbles.
If we cannot have the way smoothed it answers every purpose if we have
angels to bear us up in their hands. Since the greatest ills may arise
out of little accidents, it shews the wisdom of the Lord that from the
smaller evils we are protected.

[Psa 91:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#013.md)

"Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder." Over force and fraud shalt
thou march victoriously; bold opponents and treacherous adversaries
shall alike be trodden down. When our shoes are iron and brass, lions
and adders are easily enough crushed beneath our heel. "The young lion
and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet." The strongest foe in
power, and the most mysterious in cunning, shall be conquered by the man
of God. Not only from stones in the way, but from serpents also, shall
we be safe. To men who dwell in God the most evil forces become
harmless, they wear a charmed life, and defy the deadliest ills. Their
feet come into contact with the worst of foes, even Satan himself
nibbles at their heel, but in Christ Jesus they have the assured hope of
bruising Satan under their feet shortly. The people of God are the real
"George and the dragon," the true lion-kings and serpent-tamers. Their
dominion over the powers of darkness makes them cry, "Lord, even the
devils are subject unto us through thy word."

[Psalms 91:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 91:14</span></span>

14 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I
will set him on high, because he hath known my name.

15 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in
trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.

16 With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.

[Psa 91:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#014.md)

Here we have the Lord himself speaking of his own chosen one. "Because
he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him." Not because
he deserves to be thus kept, but because with all his imperfections he
does love his God; therefore not the angels of God only, but the God of
angels himself will come to his rescue in all perilous times, and will
effectually deliver him. When the heart is enamoured of the Lord, all
taken up with him, and intensely attached to him, the Lord will
recognise the sacred flame, and preserve the man who bears it in his
bosom. It is love, - love set upon God, which is the distinguishing mark
of those whom the Lord secures from ill. "I will set him on high,
because he hath known my name." The man has known the attributes of God
so as to trust in him, and then by experience has arrived at a yet
deeper knowledge, this shall be regarded by the Lord as a pledge of his
grace, and he will set the owner of it above danger or fear, where he
shall dwell in peace and joy. None abide in intimate fellowship with God
unless they possess a warm affection towards God, and an intelligent
trust in him; these grits of grace are precious in Jehovah's eyes, and
wherever he sees them he smiles upon them. How elevated is the standing
which the Lord gives to the believer. We ought to covet it right
earnestly. If we climb on high it may be dangerous, but if God sets us
there it is glorious.

[Psa 91:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#015.md)

"He shall call upon me, and I will answer him." He will have need to
pray, he will be led to pray aright, and the answer shall surely come.
Saints are first called of God, and then they call upon God; such calls
as theirs always obtain answers. Not without prayer will the blessing
come to the most favoured, but by means of prayer they shall receive all
good things. "I will be with him in trouble," or "I am with him in
trouble." Heirs of heaven are conscious of a special divine presence in
times of severe trial. God is always near in sympathy and in power to
help his tried ones. "I will deliver him, and honour him." The man
honours God, and God honours him. Believers are not delivered or
preserved in a way which lowers them, and makes them feel themselves
degraded; far from it, the Lord's salvation bestows honour upon those it
delivers. God first gives us conquering grace, and then rewards us for
it.

[Psa 91:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#016.md)

"With long life will I satisfy him." The man described in this Psalm
fills out the measure of his days, and whether he dies young or old he
is quite satisfied with life, and is content to leave it. He shall rise
from life's banquet as a man who has had enough, and would not have more
even if he could. "And shew him my salvation." The full sight of divine
grace shall be his closing vision. He shall look from Amana and Lebanon.
Not with destruction before him black as night, but with salvation
bright as noonday smiling upon him he shall enter into his rest.
