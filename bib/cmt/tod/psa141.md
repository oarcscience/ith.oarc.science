### [Psalms Chapter 141](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 141:0</span></span>

Title. - A Psalm of David. Yes, David under suspicion, half afraid to
speak lest he should speak unadvisedly while trying to clear himself;
David slandered and beset by enemies; David censured even by saints, and
taking it kindly; David deploring the condition of the godly party of
whom he was the acknowledged head; David waiting upon God with confident
expectation. The Psalm is one of a group of four, and it bears a
striking likeness to the other three. Its meaning lies so deep as to be
in places exceedingly obscure, yet even upon its surface it has dust of
gold. In its commencement the Psalm is lighted up with the evening glow
as the incense rises to heaven; then comes a night of language whose
meaning we cannot see; and this gives place to morning light in which
our eyes are unto the Lord.

Division. - The Psalmist cries for acceptance in prayer ([Psa
141:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#001), [Psa
141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002)); then he begs to be kept as to
his speech, preserved in heart and deed, and delivered from every sort
of fellowship with the ungodly. He prefers to be rebuked by the gracious
rather than to be flattered by the wicked, and consoles himself with the
confident assurance that he will one day be understood by the godly
party, and made to be a comfort to them ([Psa
141:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#003)). In [Psa
141:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#007) the slandered saint
represents the condition of the persecuted church, looks away to God and
pleads for rescue from his cruel enemies, and for the punishment of his
oppressors.

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Whole Psalm

This Psalm, like the one before it, is distinguished by a pregnant
brevity and the use of rare expressions, while at the same time it is
full of verbal and real coincidences with the other Psalms of David.
These indications are so clear and undeniable, that a sceptical critic
of great eminence (De Wette) pronounces it one of the oldest Psalms in
the collection. - Joseph Addison Alexander.

Whole Psalm

Few Psalms in so small a compass crowd together so many gems of precious
and holy truth. - Barton Bouchier.

Whole Psalm

Many commentators are strongly of opinion that this Psalm was written as
a memorial of that very interesting scene in the life of David recorded
in 1 Sam. 24, relating to his generous treatment of Saul. Though he had
an opportunity of putting his cruel persecutor to death in the cave of
Engedi, yet he spared his life, only cutting off his skirt, and not
suffering his followers to touch him; and when Saul had gone out of the
cave, David, going out after him, remonstrated with him from some
distance in the gentlest and most respectful language in regard to the
injustice of his conduct towards him. It is thought that [Psa
141:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#006) contains so express a reference
to this very remarkable occurrence in David's history, as to leave
little doubt that it was the occasion on which the Psalm was composed. -
James Anderson's Note to Calvin, in loc.

Whole Psalm

The imagery and allusions of the Psalm are in keeping; viz., the oil
which had lately anointed him; and the watch before his mouth, etc.,
suggested by the watching at the mouth of the cave, though ultimately
referring to the tabernacle service. - John Jebb.

[Psa 141:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#001)

"Lord, I cry unto thee." Misbelief doth seek many ways for delivery from
trouble; but faith hath but one way, - to go to God, to wit, by prayer,
for whatsoever is needful!. - David Dickson.

[Psa 141:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#001)

"Lord, I cry unto thee." No distress or danger, how great soever, shall
stifle my faith or stop my mouth, but it shall make me more earnest, and
my prayers, like strong streams in narrow straits, shall bear down all
before them. - John Trapp.

[Psa 141:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#001)

"Unto thee ... unto me." Our prayer and God's mercy are like two buckets
in a well; while the one ascends, the other descends. - Ezekiel Hopkins.

[Psa 141:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#001)

Note that the difference of tense, "I have cried" (Heb., lxx., and
Vulgate) followed by "when I cry," signifies the earnest perseverance of
the saint in prayer, never ceasing, so long as trouble lasts. And
trouble does last so long as we are in the world; wherefore the apostle
teaches us to "Pray without ceasing." - Augustine and Bruno, in Neale
and Littledale.

[Psa 141:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#001)

That the Psalmist was now in some distress, whereof he was deeply
sensible, is evident from the vehemency of his spirit, which he
expresseth in the reiteration of his request or supplication ([Psa
141:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#001)); and by his desire that his
"prayer might come before the Lord like incense, and the lifting up of
his hands as the evening sacrifice" ([Psa
141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002)). The Jewish expositors guess,
not improbably, that in that allusion he had regard unto his present
exclusion from the holy services of the tabernacle, which in other
places he deeply complains of.

For the matter of his prayer in this beginning of the Psalm, it
respecteth himself, and his deportment under his present condition,
which he desireth may be harmless and holy, becoming himself, and useful
to others. And whereas he was two ways liable to miscarry; first, by too
high an exasperation of spirit against his oppressors and persecutors;
and, secondly, by a fraudulent and pusillanimous compliance with them in
their wicked courses; - which are the two extremes which men are apt
sinfully to run into in such conditions: he prays earnestly to be
delivered from them both. The first he hath respect unto in [Psa
141:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#003), "Set a watch, O Lord, before my
mouth; keep the door of my lips": namely, that he might not, under those
great provocations which were given him, break forth into an unseemly
intemperance of speech against his unjust oppressors, which sometimes
fierce and unreasonable cruelties will wrest from the most sedate and
moderate spirits. But it was the desire of this holy Psalmist, as in
like cases it should be ours, that his heart might be always preserved
in such a frame, under the conduct of the Spirit of God, as not to be
surprised into an expression of distempered passion in any of his words
or sayings. The other he regards in his earnest supplication to be
delivered from it, [Psa 141:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#004),
"Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked works with
men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties." There are
two parts of his request unto the purpose intended.

I. That by the power of God's grace influencing his mind and soul, his
heart might not be inclined unto any communion or society with his
wicked adversaries in their wickedness.

II\. That he might be preserved from a liking of, or a longing after
those things, which are the baits and allurements whereby men are apt to
be drawn into societies and conspiracies with the workers of iniquity;
"And let me not eat of their dainties." See [Pro
1:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#010). For he here describeth the
condition of men prospering for a season in a course of wickedness; they
firstly give up themselves unto the practice of iniquity, and then
together solace themselves in those satisfactions of their lusts, with
which their power and interest in the world do furnish them.

These are the "dainties," for which an impotent longing and desire do
betray the minds of unstable persons unto a compliance with ways of sin
and folly, for I look on these "dainties" as comprising whatever the
lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh, or the pride of life can
afford. All these David prays to be delivered from any inclination unto;
especially when they are made the allurements of a course of sin. In the
enjoyment of these "dainties," it is the common practice of wicked men
to soothe up, and mutually encourage one another in the way and course
wherein they are engaged. And this completes that poor felicity which in
this world so many aspire unto, and whereof alone they are capable. The
whole of it is but a society in perishing sensual enjoyments, without
control, and with mutual applauses from one another. This the Psalmist
had a special regard unto when casting his eye towards another communion
and society which he longed-after ([Psa
141:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#005)). He saw there not dainties but
rebukes: he discerned that which is most opposite unto those mutual
applauses and rejoicings in one another, which is the salt and cement of
all evil societies, for he noticed rebukes and reproofs for the least
miscarriages that shall be observed. Now whereas the dainties which some
enjoy in a course of prosperous wickedness, are that alone which seems
to have anything in it amongst them that is desirable, and on the other
side rebukes and reproofs are those alone which seem to have any
sharpness, or matter of uneasiness and dislike in the society of the
godly, David balanceth that which seemeth to be sharpest in the one
society, against that which seems to be sweetest in the other, and,
without respect unto other advantages, prefers the one above the other.
Hence, some read the beginning of the words, "Let the righteous rather
smite me," meaning, "rather than that I should eat of the dainties of
the ungodly." - John Owen.

[Psa 141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002)

"Let my prayer be set forth before thee." Margin, directed. The Hebrew
word means to fit; to establish; to make firm. The Psalmist desires that
his prayer should not be like that which is feeble, languishing, easily
dissipated; but that it should be like that which is firm and secure. -
Albert Barnes.

[Psa 141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002)

"Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense." Literally, Let my
prayer, incense, be set in order before Thee, - implying that prayer was
in the reality what incense was in the symbol.... Passing to New
Testament Scripture, though still only to that portion which refers to
Old Testament times, we are told of the people without being engaged in
prayer, while Zacharias was offering incense within the Sanctuary ([Luk
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#010)); they were in spirit going along
with the priestly service. And in the book of Revelation the prayers of
saints are once and again identified with the offering of incense on the
golden altar before the throne. [Rev
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#008); [Rev
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003), [Rev
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#004). - Patrick Fairbairn, in "The
Typology of Scripture."

[Psa 141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002)

"Set forth." Prayer is knowing work, believing work, thinking work,
searching work, humbling work, and nothing worth if heart and hand do
not join in it. - Thomas Adam, 1701-1784.

[Psa 141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002)

"Set forth before thee as incense," whose fragrant smoke still ascends
upwards. But many times in the very ascent, whilst it strives up higher
and higher, infimo phantasmate verberatur, saith Gregory, "it is beaten
back again by earthly imaginations which intervene," and then is
extenuated by degrees, and vanisheth to nothing. Therefore the prophet
prays ut dirigatur oratio, "that his prayer may be set before God," ut
stabiliatur; so some render it out of the Hebrew, "that it may be
established," that it may neither evaporate itself nor be whiffed about
with the wind of vain and contrary imaginations, which come ab
extrinseco \[from without\], and may corrupt it. - Anthony Farindon.

[Psa 141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002)

"As incense." That in general by incense prayer is signified, the
Scripture expressly testifieth. And there is a fourfold resemblance
between them,

I. In that it was beaten and pounded before it was used. So doth
acceptable prayer proceed from a broken and contrite heart, [Psa
51:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#017).

II\. It was of no use until fire was put under it, and that taken from
the altar. Nor is that prayer of any virtue or efficacy which is not
kindled by the fire from above, the Holy Spirit of God, which we have
from our altar, Christ Jesus.

III\. It naturally ascended upwards towards heaven, as all offerings in
the Hebrew are called עלּות, "ascensions," risings up. And this is the
design of prayer, to ascend unto the throne of God, "I will direct unto
thee, and will look up"; that is, pray - [Psa
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#003).

IV\. It yielded a sweet savour; which was one end of it in temple
services, wherein there was so much burning of flesh and blood. So doth
prayer yield a sweet savour unto God; a savour of rest, wherein he is
well pleased. - John Owen.

[Psa 141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002)

"As incense as the evening sacrifice." Though this address of mine must
necessarily want all that solemnity of preparation required in the
service of thy holy Tabernacle, the cloud of incense and perfume, etc.,
the mincha or oblation of fine flour, etc., yet let the purity and
fervour of any heart, and the innocency of my hands, now lifted up to
thee in this sad hour of my distress, be accepted instead of all these,
and prevail for deliverance and a safe retreat to me and my companions.
- Charles Peters ( - 1777), in "A Critical Dissertation on the Book of
Job," 1751.

[Psa 141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002)

"As the evening sacrifice." This should be our daily service, as a lamb
was offered up morning and evening for a sacrifice. But, alas! how dull
and dead are our devotions! Like Pharaoh's chariots, they drive on
heavily. Some, like Balaam's ass, scarce ever open their mouths twice. -
Thomas Adams.

[Psa 141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002)

"My hands." Spreading forth our hands in believing and fervent prayer is
the only way of grasping mercy. - F. E., in "The Saints Ebenezer," 1667.

[Psa 141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002)

In the gorgeous ceremonial worship of the Hebrews, none of the senses
were excluded from taking part in the service The sense of smell
occupied, perhaps, the most prominent place; for the acceptance of the
worship was always indicated by a symbol borrowed from this sense, "The
Lord smelled a sweet savour." The prayer of the people ascended as
incense, and the lifting up of their hands as the evening sacrifice. The
offering of incense formed an essential part of the religious service.
The altar of incense occupied one of the most conspicuous and honoured
positions in the tabernacle and temple On this altar a censer full of
incense poured forth its fragrant clouds every morning and evening; and
yearly, as the day of atonement came round, when the high priest entered
the holy of holies, he filled a censer with live coals from the sacred
fire on the altar of burnt-offerings, and bore it into the sanctuary,
where he threw upon the burning coals the "sweet incense beaten small,"
which he had brought in his hand. Without this smoking censer he was
forbidden, on pain of death, to enter into the awful shrine of Jehovah.
Notwithstanding the washing of his flesh, and the linen garments with
which he was clothed, he dare not enter the holiest of all with the
blood of atonement, unless he could personally shelter himself under a
cloud of incense.

It has been supposed by some writers that incense was invented for the
purpose of concealing or neutralizing the noxious effluvia caused by the
number of beasts slaughtered every day in the sanctuary. Other writers
have attached a mystical import to it, and believed that it was a symbol
of the breath of the world arising in praise to the Creator, the four
ingredients of which it was composed representing the four elements.
While a third class, looking upon the tabernacle as the palace of God,
the theocratic King of Israel, and the ark of the covenant as his
throne, regarded the incense as merely corresponding to the perfume so
lavishly employed about the person and appointments of an Oriental
monarch. It may doubtless have been intended primarily to serve these
purposes and convey these meanings, but it derived its chief importance
in connection with the ceremonial observances of the Mosaic ritual from
the fact of its being the great symbol of prayer. It was offered at the
time when the people were in the posture and act of devotion; and their
prayers were supposed to be presented to God by the priest, and to
ascend to him in the smoke and odour of that fragrant offering.
Scripture is full of allusions to it, understood in this beautiful
symbolical sense. Acceptable, prevailing prayer was a sweet-smelling
savour to the Lord; and prayer that was unlawful, or hypocritical, or
unprofitable, was rejected with disgust by the organ of smell.

Doubtless the Jews felt, when they saw the soft white clouds of fragrant
smoke rising slowly from the altar of incense, as if the voice of the
priest were silently but eloquently pleading in that expressive emblem
in their behalf. The association of sound was lost in that of smell, and
the two senses were blended in one. And this symbolical mode of
supplication, as Dr. George Wilson has remarked, has this one advantage
over spoken or written prayer, that it appealed to those who were both
blind and deaf, a class that are usually shut out from social worship by
their affliction. Those who could not hear the prayers of the priest
could join in devotional exercises symbolized by incense, through the
medium of their sense of smell; and the hallowed impressions shut out by
one avenue were admitted to the mind and heart by another.

The altar of incense stood in the closest connection with the altar of
burnt-offerings. The blood of the sin-offering was sprinkled on the
horns of both on the great day of annual atonement. Morning and evening,
as soon as the sacrifice was offered, the censer poured forth its
fragrant contents, so that the perpetual incense within ascended
simultaneously with the perpetual burnt-offering outside. Without the
live coals from off the sacrificial altar, the sacred incense could not
be kindled; and without the incense previously filling the holy place,
the blood of atonement from the altar of burnt-offering could not be
sprinkled on the mercy-seat. Beautiful and expressive type of the
perfect sacrifice and the all-prevailing intercession of Jesus - of
intercession founded upon atonement, of atonement preceded and followed
by intercession! Beautiful and expressive type, too, of the prayers of
believers kindled by the altar-fire of Christ's sacrifice, and perfumed
by his merits! - Hugh Macmillan, in "The Ministry of Nature," 1871.

[Psa 141:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#003)

"Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth," etc.

I. A man would never use this language without a conviction of the
importance of the subject ... Everything is transacted by speech, in
natural, civil, and religious concerns how much, therefore, depends on
the good or evil management of the tongue! What an ardour of holy love
and friendship, or of anger and malice, may a few words fan into a
flame! The tongue is the principal instrument in the cause of God; and
it is the chief engine of the devil; give him this, and he asks no more
- there is no mischief or misery he will not accomplish by it. The use,
the influence of it, therefore, is inexpressible; and words are never to
be considered only as effects, but as causes, the operation of which can
never be fully imagined. Let us suppose a case, I fear, but too common.
You drop, in the thoughtlessness of conversation, or for the sake of
argument or wit, some irreligious, sceptical expression - it lodges in
the memory of a child, or a servant - it takes root in a soil favourable
to such seed - it gradually springs up, and brings forth fruit, in the
profanation of the Sabbath; the neglect of the means of grace; in the
reading of improper books; in the choice of dangerous companions; - who
can tell where it will end? But there is a Being who knows where it
began. It will be acknowledged that some have it in their power, by
reason of their office, talents, and influence, to do much more injury
than others; but none are so insignificant as to be harmless.

II\. A man would never use this language without a conviction that he is
in danger of transgression. And if David was conscious of a liableness
to err, shall we ever presume on our safety? Our danger arises from the
depravity of our nature. "The heart is deceitful above all things, and
desperately wicked"; and "who can bring a clean thing out of an
unclean?" Our danger arises from the contagion of example. There is
nothing in which mankind are more universally culpable than in the
disorders of speech. Yet with these we are constantly surrounded; and to
these we have been accustomed from our impressible infancy. We are in
danger from the frequency of speech. "In the multitude of words there
wanteth not sin." We must of necessity speak often; but we often speak
without necessity. Duty calls us to intermingle much with our
fellow-creatures; but we are too little in the closet, and too much in
the crowd - and when we are in company we forget the admonition, "Let
every man be swift to hear, and slow to speak."

III\. A man would never use this language without a conviction of
inability to preserve himself. The Bible teaches us this truth, not only
doctrinally, but historically. The examples of good men, and men eminent
in godliness, confirm it in the very article before us. Moses, the
meekest man in the earth, "spake unadvisedly with his lips." You have
heard of the patience of Job, but he "cursed the day of his birth"; and
Jeremiah, the prophet of the Lord, did the same. Peter said, "Though all
men should be offended because of thee, I will never be offended; though
I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee." But how did he use
his tongue a few hours after? Then "began he to curse and to swear,
saying, I know not the man!"

IV\. A man would never use this language without a conviction of the
wisdom of applying to God for the assistance he needs. Prayer is the
effect of our weakness, and the expression of our dependence. It
confesses the agency of God.

1\. In the first place - God is equal to our preservation.

2\. His succours are not to be obtained without prayer.

3\. Prayer always brings the assistance it implores. - Condensed from W.
day's Sermon on "The Regulation of the Tongue."

[Psa 141:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#003)

"Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth." etc. Watching and prayer are
often joined together. We are best kept when recommended into God's
hand. I do observe here, First, That unadvised and passionate speeches
do easily drop from us in our troubles, especially in our persecution.
Secondly, That a godly, conscientious man is very tender of these, as of
all evil. He that would live in communion with God for the present, and
hope to appear with comfort before him hereafter, is sensible of the
least thing that tends to God's displeasure, and God's dishonour: this
is the true spirit of one that will be owned by Christ at the last day.
Thirdly, There is no way to prevent being provoked to impatience and
rashness of speech, or any evil, but by keeping a watch, and renewing
our obligations to God. Fourthly, Whoever would keep a watch must call
in the aid and assistance of God's grace; "Lord, set a watch before my
mouth." - Thomas Manton.

[Psa 141:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#003)

"Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth," etc. Thus holy men have kept the
sessions at home, and made their hearts the foremen of the jury, and
examined themselves as we examine others. The fear of the Lord stood at
the door of their souls, to examine every thought before it went in, and
at the door of their lips, to examine every word before it went out,
whereby they escaped a thousand sins which we commit, as though we had
no other work. - Henry Smith.

[Psa 141:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#003)

"Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth." Nature having made my lips to be
a door to my words, let grace keep that door, that no word may be
suffered to go out which may any way tend to the dishonour of God, or
the hurt of others. - Matthew Henry.

[Psa 141:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#003)

"Set a watch," etc. Let a seal for words not to be spoken lie on the
tongue. A watch over words is better than over wealth. - Lucian.

[Psa 141:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#003)

"Keep the door of my lips." That it move not creaking and complaining,
as on rusty hinges, for want of the oil of joy and gladness. David had
somewhat to do with his tongue, as we see ([Psa
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#001), [Psa
39:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#003)); and when he had carted the ark,
how untowardly he spake, as if the fault were more in God than himself,
that there Was such a breach made in Uzzah ([Ch1
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#012)). It was but need thus to pray.
- John Trapp.

[Psa 141:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#004)

"Incline not my heart to any evil thing," etc. The present pleasure and
commodity of sin is in high estimation with the sinner, and much sweeter
to him than what he may lawfully enjoy; the pleasures of sin are his
delicates. No man can keep himself from being taken with the allurements
of a sinful course, except the Lord preserve him: "Let me not eat of
their dainties." The holiest men In Scripture have been most sensible of
the impotency of their own free will, and of their inability to resist
temptations, or to bring the principles of grace into action; most
diffident of themselves, most dependent upon God, most careful to make
use of means, and conscientious in following of ordinances, as their
prayers do testify: "Incline not my heart to any evil thing," etc. -
David Dickson.

[Psa 141:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#004)

"Incline not my heart." Heb. Let not be inclined my heart. - John Jebb.

[Psa 141:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#004)

"My heart." That man is like Esau which had an inheritance, which had a
heart but now he hath not possession of his own; therefore, give God thy
heart, that he may keep it; and not a piece of thy heart, not a room in
thy heart, but thy heart. The heart divided, dyeth. God is not like the
mother which would have the child divided, but like the natural mother,
which said, rather than it should be divided, let her take all. Let the
devil have all, if he which gave it be not worthy of it. God hath no
cope-mate, therefore he will have no parting of stakes, but all or none;
and therefore he which asks here thy heart, in [Deu
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#005), asketh "all thy heart, all thy
soul, and all thy strength"; thrice he requireth all, lest we should
keep a thought behind. Yet it is thy heart, that is, a vain heart, a
barren heart, a sinful heart, until thou give it unto God, and then it
is the spouse of Christ, the temple of the Holy Ghost, and the image of
God, so changed, and formed, and refined, that God calls it a new heart.

There is such strife for the heart as there was for Moses's body. "Give
it me," saith the Lord; "give it me," saith the tempter; "give it me,"
saith the pope; "give it me," saith riches; "give it me," saith
pleasure; as though thou must needs give it to some one. Now here is the
choice, whether thou wilt give it to God or the devil; God's heart or
the devil's heart; whose wilt thou be? - Henry Smith.

[Psa 141:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#004)

"Let me not eat of their dainties." Sin is not only meat, but sweet
meat; not only bread, but pleasant bread to an evil heart. Daniel for
some weeks ate no pleasant bread; he ate bread to keep life and soul
together, but he forbare feasting or good cheer. Sin is a feast to a
carnal man, it is his good cheer, yea, it is "dainties" to him. David,
speaking of wicked men says, "Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to
practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of
their dainties." These "dainties" may be expounded either for the
prosperity that comes in by wicked practices (some by wicked ways get
not only their ordinary food but "dainties"); or those "dainties" are
sin itself: they feasted themselves in doing evil: "Lord, let me not eat
of their dainties." If that be their food I had rather starve than eat
with them. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 141:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#004)

"Their dainties." The enemies of David were sensual and luxurious; and
they would have gladly admitted him to share in their banquets, if his
character had resembled their own. He entreats to be preserved from
inducement so to do. - William Walford.

[Psa 141:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#005)

"Let the righteous smite me," etc. This verse is so obscure as to be
almost unintelligible. According to the English versions, it expresses
his willingness to be rebuked by good men for his benefit. But this
sense is not only hard to be extracted from the words, but foreign from
the context. Of the many contradictory interpretations which have been
proposed the most probable is that which makes the sentence mean, that
the sufferings endured by the good man, even at the hand of the wicked,
are chastisements inflicted by a righteous God in justice and with
mercy, and as such may be likened to a festive ointment, which the head
of the sufferer should not refuse, as he will still have need of
consolation and occasion to invoke God, in the midst of trials and of
mischiefs yet to be experienced. - Joseph Addison Alexander.

[Psa 141:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#005)

"Let the righteous smite me." The word הלס is seldom used in Scripture
but to signify a severe stroke which shakes the subject smitten, and
causeth it to tremble; see [Pro 23:35](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#035);
[Sa1 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#016); [Psa
74:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#006); and it is used for the stroke of
the hammer on the anvil in fashioning of the iron ([Isa
41:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#007)). Wherefore the word חסד
following may be taken adverbially, as a lenitive of that severity which
this word importeth: "Let him smite me, but" leniter, benign,
misericordtier, "gently, kindly, friendly, mercifully:" and so some
translations read the words, "Let the righteous smite me friendly, or
kindly." - John Owen.

[Psa 141:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#005)

"Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness," etc. Grace will
teach a Christian to take those potions which are wholesome, though they
be not toothsome. Faithful reproof is a token of love, and therefore may
well be esteemed a kindness. Such wounding of a friend is healing, and
so David might well call it "an excellent oil." And he did not only say
so, which is easy and ordinary, but acted accordingly. He did not as the
papists, who highly commend holy water, but turn away their faces when
it comes to be sprinkled on them. When he had by sin, and continuance in
it, so gangrened his flesh, and corrupted himself, that he was in danger
of death he suffered his sores to be thoroughly searched without regret.
Nathan was the chirurgeon whom God employed to search that wound which
had divers mouths for festering in his soul; and truly he did not daily
with his patient, though he were a prince, but thrust his instrument to
the bottom; yet whatever pain it put him to, he took it patiently, and
was so far from being angry with the prophet, that he made him one of
his privy council. It is a sign of a polluted nature for a man, like a
serpent, if he be but touched, to gather poison and vomit it up at the
party. "Rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee": [Pro
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#008). - George Swinnock.

[Psa 141:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#005)

"Let the righteous smite me," etc. If the righteous smite us by
reproofs, it must be taken as a kindness, and as a precious balsam,
which doth not break our head, but heal us. Not that we are bound to
belie ourselves in compliance with every man's censorious humour that
will accuse us; but we must be readier to censure ourselves than others,
and readier to confess a fault than to expect a confession from others
whom we reprove. Sincerity and serious repentance will be honourable in
that person who is most careful to avoid sin, and most ready penitently
to confess it when he hath been overcome, and truly thankful to those
that call him to repentance; as being more desirous that God and his
laws and religion should have the glory of their holiness, than that he
himself should have the undue glory of innocency, and escape the
deserved shame of sin.

It is one of the most dangerous diseases of professors, and one of the
greatest scandals of this age, that persons taken for eminently
religious are more impatient of pain, though just, reproof than many a
drunkard, swearer, or fornicator; and when they have spent hours or days
in the seeming earnest confession of their sin, and lament before God
and man that they cannot do it with more grief and tears, yet they take
it for a heinous injury in another that will say half so much against
them, and take him for a malignant enemy of the godly who will call them
as they call themselves. - Richard Baxter (1615-1691), in "The Morning
Exercises."

[Psa 141:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#005)

"Let the righteous smite me." If a righteous or a right-wise man smite
and reprove, he will do it,

A. Sine felle, without gall, without bitterness.

B. Sine publicatione, without publishing, divulging, or telling it to
the world.

C. Sine contumelia, without disgrace - to reform his friend, not to
disgrace him.

D. Sine adulatione, without flattery.

E. Non sine Deo, not without God. - John Gore, in a Sermon entitled
"Unknowne Kindnesse," 1635.

[Psa 141:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#005)

"The righteous," etc. The minister cannot be always preaching; two or
three hours, may be, in a week, he spends among his people in the
pulpit, holding the glass of the gospel before their faces; but the
lives of professors, these preach all the week long: if they were but
holy and exemplary, they would be as a repetition of the preacher's
sermon to their families and neighbours among whom they converse, and
keep the sound of his doctrine continually ringing in their ears. This
would give Christians an amiable advantage in doing good to their carnal
neighbours by counsel and reproof, which now is seldom done, and when
done it proves to little purpose, because not backed with their own
exemplary walking. "It behoves him," saith Tertullian, "that would
counsel or reprove another, to guard his speech with the authority of
his own conversation, lest, wanting that, what he says puts himself to
the blush." We do not love one that hath a stinking breath to come very
near us; such, therefore, had need have a sweet-scented life.

Reproofs are a good physic, but they have an unpleasant reception; it is
hard far men not to throw them back on the face of them that gives them.
Now nothing is more powerful to keep a reproof from thus coming back
than the holiness of the person that reproves. "Let the righteous smite
me." saith David, "it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it
shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head." See how well
it is taken from such a hand, from the authority that holiness carries
with it. None but a vile wretch will smite a righteous man with reproach
for smiting him with a reproof, if softly laid on, and like oil
fomented, and wrought into him, as it should, with compassion and love
to his soul! Thus we see how influential the power of holiness would be
unto the wicked, neither would it be less upon our brethren and
fellow-Christians. Holy David professed he would take it as a kindness
for the righteous to smite him; yea, as kindly as if he broke a box of
precious oil upon his head, which was amongst the Jews a high expression
of love. - William Gurnall.

[Psa 141:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#005)

"It shall be a kindness"

I. It is a kindness reducere erratum, to bring back the wandering.

II\. Sanare aegrotum, to recover the sick.

III\. Suscitare lethargum, to awake, to stir up the lethargic, the
sleepy.

IV\. Ligare insanum, to bind a mad-man.

V. Liberare perditum, to save a lost man, one in imminent danger. - John
Gore.

[Psa 141:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#005)

"It shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head." Some
persons pride themselves on being blunt, or, as they call it, "honest";
but very blunt people do little good to others, and get little love to
themselves. The Scriptures recommend gentleness and kindness. Reproof
should fall like the dew, and not like the rushing hail-storm. The "oil"
insinuates itself; the stone wounds and then rebounds. Christians should
take heed of getting fond of the work of "rebuking." Such "spiritual
constables" do a great deal of mischief without intending it. They are
in a church what a very witty and sarcastic person is in society, or
what a tell - tale is in school; and approximate very closely to that
class which the apostle terms "busybodies in other men's matters." Our
manner must be tender and winning. The nail of reproof, says an old
writer, must be well oiled in kindness before it is driven home.
Meddling with the faults of others is like attempting to move a person
afflicted with the rheumatic gout, it must be done slowly and tenderly,
nor must we be frightened by an outcry or two. The great thing is to
show the person that you really love him; and if you manifest this in
the sight of God, he will bless your efforts, and give you favour in the
sight of an erring brother. - Christian Treasury.

[Psa 141:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#005)

"It shall be an excellent oil." Certain oils are said to have a most
salutary effect on the head; hence in fevers, or any other complaints
which effect the head, the medical men always recommend oil. I have
known people who were deranged, cured in a very short time by nothing
more than the application of a peculiar kind of oil to the head. There
are, however, other kinds which are believed, when thus applied, to
produce delirium. Thus the reproofs of the righteous were compared to
"excellent oil," which produced a most salutary effect on the head. So
common is this practice of anointing the head, that all who can afford
it do it every week.

But, strange as it may appear, the crown of their heads is the place
selected for the chastisement; thus owners of slaves, or husbands, or
schoolmasters, beat the heads of the offenders with their knuckles.
Should an urchin come late to school, or forget his lesson, the
pedagogue says to some of the other boys, "Go, beat his head! Begone,
fellow! or I will beat thy head." Should a man be thus chastised by an
inferior, he quotes the old proverb, "If my head is to be beaten, let it
be done with the fingers that have rings on"; meaning a man of rank.
"Yes, yes; let a holy man smite my head I and what of that? it is an
excellent oil." "My master has been beating my head, but it has been
good oil for me." - Joseph Roberts.

[Psa 141:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#005)

"Oil, which shall not break my head." When I first took this text in
hand, this seemed unto me a very strange and uncouth expression. If the
Psalmist had said, It shall be a stone that shall not break my head,
etc., we had easily understood him; but to speak of an oil, or a balm,
which we know to be so soft, so supple, so lithe and gentle an ointment,
that he should speak of breaking his head with oil, it is strange. I
confess it troubled me a while, till at length I conceived it might be
spoken by contraries; as when a physician gives a patient some pectoral,
or cordial, and saith, Take this, it will not hurt you; his meaning is,
it will help and do him good. So this oil shall not break my head; that
is, it shall heal it, being broken by my own corruption, by Satan's
temptations, and by the evil influence of such as flatter me in my sins.
- John Gore.

[Psa 141:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#005)

David could say of his enemy that cursed him, "Let him alone, for God
hath bidden him to curse"; much more safely mayest thou say of thy
friend that reproves thee, "Let him alone, for God hath bidden him to
smite." And as the apostle saith of ministers, that God "doth entreat
you by us"; so persuade yourselves that God doth reprove you by them. -
John Gore.

[Psa 141:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#005)

It was the saying of a heathen, though no heathenish saying, "That he
who would be good, must either have a faithful friend to instruct him,
or a watchful enemy to correct him." Should we murder a physician
because he comes to cure us; or like him worse, because he would make us
better? The flaming sword of reprehension is but to keep us from the
forbidden fruit of transgression. "Let the righteous smite me; it shall
be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil,
which shall not break my head." Let him smite me as with a hammer, for
so the word signifies. A Boanerges is as necessary as a Barnabas. -
William Secker.

[Psa 141:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#005)

"Yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities." That is, if ever they
who are my reprovers fall into calamity, though they may think they
provoked me so by reproving me, that they have lost my love, and have
cast themselves out of my prayers, or that I will never speak well of
them or for them again; yet I will pray for them with all my heart, as
their matter shall require. I will pray for them when they have most
need of prayer, even "in their calamities." Some heighten the sense
thus, - The more they sharpen their reproof, the more I think myself
bound to pray for them. It shows an excellent spirit, not to be hindered
from doing good to others by anything they do or speak against us, nor
their sharpest (though perhaps mistaken) reproofs of us. Thus it was
that that good man Job "prayed for his friends," who had spoken much
against him, and not only reproved him without cause, but reproached him
without charity. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 141:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#006)

"When their judges are overthrown," etc. When the judgments in reserve
for the leaders of my enemies shall come upon them, they will perceive
too late how reasonable are my words, and wish that they had hearkened
to them sooner. - Joseph Addison Alexander.

[Psa 141:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#006)

"Overthrown." The verb rendered "overthrown" is used of Jezebel in [Kg2
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#033); "Throw her down. So they threw
her down." - Speaker's Commentary.

[Psa 141:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#006)

"They shall hear my words; for they are sweet." This is especially true
of all the words which David spake by inspiration, or the Spirit of God
spake to him; particularly in his book of Psalms, concerning the
Messiah, the covenant of grace, and the blessings of it; of the rich
experiences of grace he had, and the several doctrines of the gospel
declared by him; which were sweet, delightful, and entertaining to those
who have ears to hear such things; or those ears are opened to hear
them, so as to understand them and distinguish them, but to others not.
- John Gill.

[Psa 141:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#006)

"They shall hear my words; for they are sweet." Those that slighted the
word of God before, will relish it and be glad of it when they are in
affliction; for that opens the ear to instruction. When the world is
bitter the word is sweet. Oppressed innocency cannot gain a hearing with
those that live in pomp and pleasure; but when they come to be
overthrown themselves, they will have more compassionate thoughts of the
afflicted. - Matthew Henry.

[Psa 141:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#006)

"For they are sweet." They shall be pleasant; mild; gentle; equitable;
just. After the harsh and severe enactments of Saul, after enduring his
acts of tyranny, the people will be glad to welcome me, and to live
under the laws of a just and equal administration. The passage,
therefore, expresses confidence that Saul and his hosts would be
overthrown, and that the people of the land would gladly hail the
accession to the throne of one who had been anointed to reign over them.
- Albert Barnes.

[Psa 141:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#006), [Psa
141:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#007)

The mild and dutiful behaviour of David towards Saul and his friends are
set together by way of contrast, in the strongest light, from the
instances of each sort here produced. The first is, David's humanity
towards Saul, in giving him his life at two several times, when he had
it in his power to destroy him as he pleased. "Their judges have been
dismissed in the rocky places; and have heard my words that they are
sweet"; that is, "Their princes have been dismissed in safety, when I
had them at an advantage in those rocky deserts; and only heard me
expostulate with them in the gentlest words."

The other is, Saul's barbarity and cruelty towards David (or his
friends, which is much the same) in the horrid massacre of Ahimelech and
the priests, by the hand of Doeg the Edomite, done in such a savage
manner, that he compares it to the chopping and cleaving wood; "Like as
when one cutteth and cleaveth, so have our bones been scattered on the
earth at the command of Saul"; for so I read the Hebrew words, le-pi
Saul, at the mouth, that is, the command of Saul.

Should we suppose this passage to refer to the first time of David's
sparing Saul, viz., when he had him in his power in the cave of Engedi
(here called jedé selay), the sides of the rock, or the rocky places,
the speech he made on this occasion when he called after Saul (and which
is recorded in [Sa1 24:8-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#008)) might
well be called sweet or pleasant words. For they set his own innocence
and the king's unjust behaviour to him in so strong a light, and with
all that gentleness and mildness, and even this hard-hearted prince
could not forbear being greatly affected with it for the present; and we
are told (verses 16, 17) that "he lifted up his voice and wept." -
Charles Peters.

[Psa 141:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#007)

"Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth," etc. The primary
reference may be to the slaughter of the priests by the command of Saul,
[Sa1 22:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#016). The language, however,
may be illustrative of the many massacres like that on the eve of St.
Bartholomew, so numerous as to be scattered on the face of the earth,
marking the passage of pious martyrs from this world to a better, and
testifying where the blood of the slain shall be disclosed for the
judgment of their murderers. - W. Wilson.

[Psa 141:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#007)

"Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth," etc. Assuming the very
extreme, it is a look of hope into the future, should his bones and the
bones of his followers be even scattered about the mouth of Sheôl (cf.
the Syrian picture of Sheôl: "the dust upon its threshold,
‛al-escûfteh," Deutsche Morgenland. Zeitschrift, 20:513), their soul
below, their bones above - it would nevertheless be only as when one in
ploughing cleaves the earth; i.e., they do not lie there in order that
they may continue lying, but that they may rise up anew, as the seed
that is sown sprouts up out of the upturned earth. - Franz Delitzsch.

[Psa 141:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#007)

"Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth." That is to say, I and my
company are in a dying condition, free among the dead; yea, if taken we
should be put to most cruel deaths, hewn in pieces, or pulled limbmeal,
and left unburied; and our dead bodies mangled by a barbarous
inhumanity, as wood-cleavers make the shivers fly hither and thither.
This is the perilous case of me and my partisans. - John Trapp.

[Psa 141:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#007)

"Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth." - This seems to be
strong eastern painting, and almost figurative language; but that it may
be strictly true, the following extract demonstrates, "At five o'clock
we left Garigana, our journey being still to the eastward of north; and,
at a quarter past six in the evening, arrived at the village of that
name, whose inhabitants had all perished with hunger the year before;
their wretched bones being all unburied, and scattered upon the surface
of the ground, where the village formerly stood. We encamped among the
bones of the dead, as no space could be found free from them; and on the
23rd, at six in the morning, full of horror at this miserable spectacle,
we set out for Teawa." - (James Bruce's Travels.) To the Jews such a
spectacle must have been very dreadful, as the want of burial was
esteemed one of the greatest calamities which could befall them. -
Burder's "Oriental Customs."

[Psa 141:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#007)

"Like one ploughing and cleaving in the earth." This clause may be
explained not of cleaving wood but ploughing, to which the first verb is
applied in Arabic. Like (one) ploughing and cleaving (making furrows) in
the earth, not for the sake of mangling its surface, but to make it
fruitful and productive, (so) our bones are scattered at the mouth of
hell, as the necessary means of a glorious resurrection. - Joseph
Addison Alexander.

[Psa 141:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#007)

Who can attend the digging of a grave, and view the ruins then
disclosed, without exclaiming, "Our bones are scattered at the grave's
mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth"? - George
Horne.

[Psa 141:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#008)

"Mine eyes are unto thee, O God the Lord." If you would keep your mind
fixed in prayer, keep your eye fixed. Much vanity comes in at the eye.
When the eyes wander in prayer the heart wanders. To think to keep the
heart fixed in prayer, and yet let the eyes gaze abroad, is as if one
should think to keep his house safe, yet let the windows be open. -
Thomas Watson.

[Psa 141:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#008)

"Leave not my soul destitute." The literal Hebrew is, Pour not out my
soul, but keep it in thy cup of salvation. - Agellius. \[Compare [Isa
53:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012) : "He hath poured out his soul
unto death."\]

[Psa 141:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#008)

"Leave not my soul destitute," or, "Cast not out my soul." That is, cast
not my life away, as water, which is of no account, is cast out of a
vessel containing it. - Daniel Cresswell.

[Psa 141:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#008)

"Leave not my soul destitute." His soul knew what it was to be
"destitute"; he had known the misery of spiritual beggary and soul
poverty. It was not with him as natural poverty is with the rich, a
matter of speculation, a mere matter of theory; but a matter of personal
and painful experience.... It is in the margin "Make not my soul bare";
Strip me not of every hope; leave me not completely naked; abandon me
not to nature's beggary and misery; let me not go down into the pit with
all my sins upon my head; leave not my soul destitute of pardon and
peace. - Joseph C. Philpot.

[Psa 141:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#008)

O pour not out my soul, I pray,

From the dark snare preserve my way

The chambers of the blind entangling net,

Which by my path the powers of evil set.

Behold them laid, the godless crew,

Low in the toils they darkly drew:

The while, with gathering heart and watchful eye,

I wait mine hour to pass victorious by.

John Keble.

"Snares," "Gins,.... Nets." The usual method of capturing or killing the
lion in Palestine was by pitfalls or nets, to both of which there are
many references in the Scriptures. The mode of hunting the lion with the
nets was identical with that which is practised in India at the present
time. The precise locality of the lion's dwelling-place having been
discovered, a circular wall of net is arranged round it, or if only a
few nets can be obtained, they are set in a curved form, the concave
side being towards the lion. They then send dogs into the thicket, hurl
stones and sticks at the den, shoot arrows into it, fling burning
torches at it, and so irritate and alarm the animal that it rushes
against the net, which is so made that it falls down and envelops the
animal in its folds. If the nets be few, the drivers go to the opposite
side of the den, and induce the lion to escape in the direction where he
sees no foes, but where he is sure to run against the treacherous net.
Other large and dangerous animals were also captured by the same means.
Another and more common, because an easier and a cheaper method, was, by
digging a deep pit, covering the mouth with a slight covering of sticks
and earth, and driving the animal upon the treacherous covering. It is
an easier method than the net, because after the pit is once dug, the
only trouble lies in throwing the covering over its mouth. But it is not
so well adapted for taking beasts alive, as they are likely to be
damaged, either by the fall into the pit, or by the means used in
getting them out again. Animals, therefore, that are caught in pits are
generally, though not always, killed before they are taken out. The net,
however, envelops the animal so perfectly, and renders it so helpless,
that it can be easily bound and taken away, The hunting net is very
expensive, and requires a large staff of men to work it, so that none
but a rich man could use the net in hunting.

Besides the net, several other modes of bird-catching were used by the
ancient Jews, just as is the case at the present day. Boys, for example,
who catch birds for their own consumption, and not for the market, can
do so by means of various traps, most of which are made on the principle
of the noose, or snare. Sometimes a great number of hair-nooses are set
in places to which the birds are decoyed, so that in hopping about, many
of them are sure to be entangled in the snares. Sometimes the noose is
ingeniously suspended in a narrow passage which the birds are likely to
traverse, and sometimes a simple fall-trap is employed. - J. G. Wood.

[Psa 141:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#010)

"Into their own nets." The word rendered "nets" occurs only in this
place, as the closely corresponding word in P [Psa
140:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#010), which is rendered "deep pits,"
occurs there only. - Speaker's Commentary.

[Psalms 141:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 141:1</span></span>

1 Lord, I cry unto thee, make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice,
when I cry unto thee.

2 Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up
of my hands as the evening sacrifice.

[Psa 141:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#001)

"Lord, I cry unto thee." This is my last resort: prayer never fails me.
My prayer is painful and feeble, and worthy only to be called a cry; but
it is a cry unto Jehovah, and this ennobles it. I have cried unto thee,
I still cry to thee, and I always mean to cry to thee. To whom else
could I go? What else can I do? Others trust to themselves, but I cry
unto thee. The weapon of all prayer is one which the believer may always
carry with him, and use in every time of need. "Make haste unto me." His
case was urgent, and he pleaded that urgency. God's time is the best
time, but when we are sorely pressed we may with holy importunity
quicken the movements of mercy. In many cases, if help should come late,
it would come too late; and we are permitted to pray against such a
calamity. "Give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee." See how a
second time he talks of crying: prayer had become his frequent, yea, his
constant exercise: twice in a few words he says, "I cry; I cry." How he
longs to be heard, and to be heard at once! There is a voice to the
great Father in every cry, and groan, and tear of his children: he can
understand what they mean when they are quite unable to express it. It
troubles the spirit of the saints when they fear that no favourable ear
is turned to their doleful cries' they cannot rest unless their "unto
thee" is answered by an "unto me." When prayer is a man's only refuge,
he is deeply distressed at the bare idea of his failing therein.

"That were a grief I could not bear,

Didst thou not hear and answer prayer;

But a prayer-hearing, answering God

Supports me under every load."

[Psa 141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002)

"Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense." As Incense is
carefully prepared, kindled with holy fire, and devoutly presented unto
God, so let my prayer be. We are not to look upon prayer as easy work
requiring no thought, it needs to be "set forth"; what is more, it must
be set forth "before the Lord," by a sense of his presence and a holy
reverence for his name: neither may we regard all supplication as
certain of divine acceptance, it needs to be set forth before the Lord
"as incense," concerning the offering of which there were rules to be
observed, otherwise it would be rejected of God. "And the lifting up of
my hands as the evening sacrifice." Whatever form his prayer might take
his one desire was that it might be accepted of God. Prayer is sometimes
presented without words by the very motions of our bodies' bended knees
and lifted hands are the tokens of earnest, expectant prayer. Certainly
work, or the lifting up of the hands in labour, is prayer if it be done
in dependence upon God and for his glory: there is a hand-prayer as well
as a heart-prayer, and our desire is that this may be sweet unto the
Lord as the sacrifice of eventide. Holy hope, the lifting up of hands
that hang down, is also a kind of worship: may it ever be acceptable
with God. The Psalmist makes a bold request: he would have his humble
cries and prayers to be as much regarded of the Lord as the appointed
morning and evening sacrifices of the holy place. Yet the prayer is by
no means too bold, for, after all, the spiritual is in the Lord's esteem
higher than the ceremonial, and the calves of the lips are a truer
sacrifice than the calves of the stall.

So far we have a prayer about prayer; we have a distinct supplication in
[Psa 141:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#003).

[Psalms 141:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 141:3</span></span>

3 Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.

4 Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked works with
men that work iniquity, and let me not eat of their dainties.

5 Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him
reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head,
for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities.

6 When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my
words; for they are sweet.

[Psa 141:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#003)

"Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth." That mouth had been used in
prayer, it would be a pity it should ever be defiled with untruth, or
pride, or wrath; yet so it will become unless carefully watched, for
these intruders are ever lurking about the door. David feels that with
all his own watchfulness he may be surprised into sin, and so he begs
the Lord himself to keep him. When Jehovah sets the watch the city is
well guarded: when the Lord becomes the guard of our mouth the whole man
is well garrisoned. "Keep the door of my lips." God has made our lips
the door of the mouth, but we cannot keep that door of ourselves,
therefore do we entreat the Lord to take the rule of it. O that the Lord
would both open and shut our lips, for we can do neither the one nor the
other aright if left to ourselves. In times of persecution by ungodly
men we are peculiarly liable to speak hastily, or evasively, and
therefore we should be specially anxious to be preserved in that
direction from every form of sin. How condescending is the Lord! We are
ennobled by being door-keepers for him, and yet he deigns to be a
door-keeper for us.

[Psa 141:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#004)

"Incline not my heart to any evil thing." It is equivalent to the
petition, "Lead us not into temptation." O that nothing may arise in
providence which would excite our desires in a wrong direction. The
Psalmist is here careful of his heart. He who holds the heart is lord of
the man; but if the tongue and the heart are under God's care all is
safe. Let us pray that he may never leave us to our own inclinings, or
we shall soon decline front the right.

"To practise wicked works with men that work iniquity." The way the
heart inclines the life soon tends: evil things desired bring forth
wicked things practised. Unless the fountain of life is kept pure the
streams of life will soon be polluted. Alas, there is great power in
company: even good men are apt to be swayed by association; hence the
fear that we may practise wicked works when we are with wicked workers.
We must endeavour not to be with them lest we sin with them. It is bad
when the heart goes the wrong way alone, worse when the life runs in the
evil road alone; but it is apt to increase unto a high degree of
ungodliness when the backslider runs the downward path with a whole
horde of sinners around him. Our practice will be our perdition if it be
evil; it is an aggravation of sin rather than an excuse for it to say
that it is our custom and our habit. It is God's practice to punish all
who make a practice of iniquity. Good men are horrified at the thought
of sinning as others do; the fear of it drives them to their knees.
Iniquity, which, being interpreted, is a want of equity, is a thing to
be shunned as we would avoid an infectious disease. "And let me not eat
of their dainties." If we work with them we shall soon eat with them.
They will bring out their sweet morsels, and delicate dishes, in the
hope of binding us to their service by the means of our palates. The
trap is baited with delicious meats that we may be captured and become
meat for their malice. If we would not sin with men we had better not
sit with them, and if we would not share their wickedness we must not
share their wantonness.

[Psa 141:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#005)

"Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness." He prefers the
bitters of gracious company to the dainties of the ungodly. He would
rather be smitten by the righteous than feasted by the wicked. He gives
a permit to faithful admonition, he even invites it - "let the righteous
smite me." When the ungodly smile upon us their flattery is cruel; when
the righteous smite us their faithfulness is kind. Sometimes godly men
rap hard; they do not merely hint at evil, but hammer at it; and even
then we are to receive the blows in love, and be thankful to the hand
which smites so heavily. Fools resent reproof; wise men endeavour to
profit by it. "And let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil,
which shall not break my head." Oil breaks no heads, and rebuke does no
man any harm; rather, as oil refreshes and perfumes, so does reproof
when fitly taken sweeten and renew the heart. My friend must love me
well if he will tell me of my faults: there is an unction about him if
he is honest enough to point out my errors. Many a man has had his head
broken at the feasts of the wicked, but none at the table of a
true-hearted reprover. The oil of flattery is not excellent; the oil so
lavishly used at the banquet of the reveller is not excellent;
head-breaking and heart-breaking attend the anointings of the riotous;
but it is otherwise with the severest censures of the godly: they are
not always sweet, but they are always excellent; they may for the moment
bruise the heart, but they never break either it or the head. "For yet
my prayer also shall be in their calamities." Gracious men never grow
wrathful with candid friends so as to harbour an ill-feeling against
them; if so, when they saw them in affliction, they would turn round
upon them and taunt them with their rebukes. Far from it; these wisely
grateful souls are greatly concerned to see their instructors in
trouble, and they bring forth their best prayers for their assistance.
They do not merely pray for them, but they so closely and heartily
sympathize that their prayers are "in their calamities," down in the
dungeon with them. So true is Christian brotherhood that we are with our
friends in sickness or persecution, suffering their griefs; so that our
heart's prayer is in their sorrows. When we can give good men nothing
more, let us give them our prayers, and let us do this doubly to those
who have given us their rebukes.

[Psa 141:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#006)

This is a verse of which the meaning seems far to seek. Does it refer to
the righteous among the Israelites? We think so. David surely means that
when their leaders fell never to rise again, they would then turn to him
and take delight in listening to his voice. "When their judges are
overthrown in stony places, they shall hear roll words; for they are
sweet." And so they did: the death of Saul made all the best of the
nation look to the son of Jesse as the Lord's anointed; his words became
sweet to them. Many of those good men who had spoken severely of David's
quitting his country, and going over to the Philistines, were
nevertheless dear to his heart for their fidelity, and to them he
returned nothing but good-will, loving prayers, and sweet speeches,
knowing that by-and-by they would overlook his faults, and select him to
be their leader. They smote him when he erred, but they recognized his
excellences. He, on his part, bore no resentment, but loved them for
their honesty. He would pray for them when their land lay bleeding at
the feet of their foreign enemies; he would come to their rescue when
their former leaders were slain; and his words of courageous hopefulness
would be sweet in their ears. This seems to me to be a good sense,
consistent with the context. At the same time, other and more laboured
interpretations have their learned admirers, and to these we will refer
in our notes from other authors.

[Psalms 141:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 141:7</span></span>

7 Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one cutteth and
cleaveth wood upon the earth.

8 But mine eyes are unto thee, O God the Lord: in thee is ray trust;
leave not my soul destitute.

9 Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me, and the gins of
the workers of iniquity.

10 Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.

[Psa 141:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#007)

David's case seemed hopeless: the cause of God in Israel was as a dead
thing, even as a skeleton broken, and rotten, and shovelled out of the
grave, to return as dust to its dust. "Our bones are scattered at the
grave's mouth." There seemed to be no life, no cohesion, no form, order,
or headship among the godly party in Israel: Saul had demolished it, and
scattered all its parts, so that it did not exist as an organized whole.
David himself was like one of these dried bones, and the rest of the
godly were in much the same condition. There seemed to be no vitality or
union among the holy seed; but their cause lay at death's door. "As when
one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth." They were like wood
divided and thrown apart, not as one piece of timber, nor even as a
bundle, but all cut to pieces, and thoroughly divided. Leaving out the
word "wood," which is supplied by the translators, the figure relates to
cleaving upon the earth, which probably means ploughing, but may signify
any other form of chopping and splitting, such as felling a forest,
tearing up bushes, or otherwise causing confusion and division, How
often have good men thought thus of the cause of God! Wherever they have
looked, death, division, and destruction have stared them in the face.
Cut and cloven, hopelessly sundered! Scattered, yea, scattered at the
grave's mouth! Split up and split for the fire! Such the cause of God
and truth has seemed to be. "Upon the earth" the prospect was wretched;
the field of the church was ploughed, harrowed, and scarified: it had
become like a wood-chopper's yard, where everything was doomed to be
broken up. We have seen churches in such a state, and have been
heart-broken. What a mercy that there is always a place above the earth
to which we can look! There lives One who will give a resurrection to
his cause, and a reunion to his divided people. He will bring up the
dead bones from the grave's mouth, and make the dried faggots live
again. Let us imitate the Psalmist in [Psa
141:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#008), and look up to the living God.

[Psa 141:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#008)

"But mine eyes are unto thee, O God the Lord." He looked upward and kept
eyes fixed there. He regarded duty more than circumstances; he
considered his promise rather than the external providence; and he
expected from God rather than from men. He did not shut his eyes in
indifference or despair, neither did he turn them to the creature in
vain confidence, but he gave his eyes to his God, and saw nothing to
fear. Jehovah his Lord is also his hope. Thomas called Jesus Lord and
God, and David here speaks of his God and Lord. Saints delight to dwell
upon the divine names when they are adoring or appealing. "In thee is my
trust." Not alone in thine attributes or in thy promises, but in
thyself. Others might confide where they chose, but David kept to his
God, in him he trusted always, only, confidently, and unreservedly.
"Leave not my soul destitute"; as it would be if the Lord did not
remember and fulfil his promise. To be destitute in circumstances is
bad, but to be destitute in soul is far worse; to be left of friends is
a calamity, but to be left of God would be destruction. Destitute of God
is destitution with a vengeance. The comfort is that God hath said, "I
will never leave thee nor forsake thee."

[Psa 141:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#009)

"Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me." He had before
asked, in [Psa 141:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#003), that the door of
his mouth might be kept; but his prayer now grows into "Keep me." He
seems more in trouble about covert temptation than concerning open
attacks. Brave men do not dread battle, but they hate secret plots. We
cannot endure to be entrapped like unsuspecting animals; therefore we
cry to the God of wisdom for protection. "And the gins of the workers of
iniquity." These evil workers sought to catch David in his speech or
acts. This was in itself a piece of in-equity, and so of a piece with
the rest of their conduct. They were bad themselves, and they wished
either to make him like themselves, or to cause him to seem so. If they
could not catch the good man in one way, they would try another; snares
and gins should be multiplied, for anyhow they were determined to work
his ruin. Nobody could preserve David but the Omniscient and Omnipotent
One, he also will preserve us. It is hard to keep out of snares which
you cannot see, and to escape gins which you cannot discover. Well might
the much-hunted Psalmist cry, "Keep me.

[Psa 141:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#010)

"Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape."
It may not be a Christian prayer, but it is a very just one, and it
takes a great deal of grace to refrain from crying Amen to it; in fact,
grace does not work towards making us wish otherwise concerning the
enemies of holy men. Do we not all wish the innocent to be delivered,
and the guilty to reap the result of their own malice? Of course we do,
if we are just men. There can be no wrong in desiring that to happen in
our own case which we wish for all good men. Yet is there a more
excellent way.
