[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 87:0</span></span>

Title. - A Psalm or Song for the sons of Korah. A sacred hymn and a
national lyric. A theocracy blends the religious and the patriotic ideas
in one; and in proportion as nations become Christianized, their popular
songs will become deeply imbued with pious sentiments. Judged by this
standard, our own land is far in arrears. This "Psalm or song" was
either composed by the sons of Korah, or dedicated to them: as they kept
the doors of the house of the Lord, they could use this beautiful
composition as a Psalm within the doors, and as a song outside.

Subject and Division. - The song is in honour of Zion, or Jerusalem, and
it treats of God's favour to that city among the mountains, the
prophecies which made it illustrious, and the honour of being a native
of it. Many conceive that it was written at the founding of David's city
of Zion, but does not the mention of Babylon imply a later date? It
would seem to have been written after Jerusalem and the Temple had been
built, and had enjoyed a history, of which glorious things could be
spoken. Among other marvels of God's love in its later history, it had
been untouched by Sennacherib when other cities of Israel and Judah had
fallen victims to his cruelty. It was in Hezekiah's reign that Babylon
became prominent, when the ambassadors came to congratulate the king
concerning his recovery, at that time also Tyre would be more famous
than at any period in David's day. But as we have no information, and
the point is not important, we may leave it, and proceed to meditate
upon the Psalm itself. We have no need to divide so brief a song.

Hints to Preachers

[Psa 87:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#002.md), [Psa
87:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#003.md). -

I. The foundation of Zion.

1\. It is but one: "foundation."

2\. It is the Lord's: "his,"

3\. It is in conformity with holiness: "holy mountains."

4\. It consists of eternal purposes.

5\. It is built up on immutable principles.

6\. It is situated in a glorious position.

II\. The favour enjoyed by Zion.

1\. God "loves the dwellings of Jacob." He led, fed, guarded, lighted,
visited them.

2\. He loves Zion "better"; and gives all those blessings in a richer
form.

3\. There are more to love.

4\. Their occupations are more spiritual.

5\. Their songs and worship are more enthusiastic.

6\. Their testimony is more powerful.

7\. Their knowledge of truth is more clear.

8\. Their fellowship is on a scale more heavenly. Let us be in the
Church, and love her.

III\. The fame of Zion. "Glorious things are spoken,"

1\. of her in history;

2\. in her by ministry;

3\. for her by Jesus;

4\. about her in prophecy. Here is a fruitful theme.

[Psa 87:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#003.md). - The idea of the text
presents the Church as "the city of God"; let us touch upon some of the
"glorious things" that are spoken of it.

I. There are glorious things with respect to the erection of the city.

1\. There is the plan of its erection. There was never a plan so
faultless, so complete, so wonderful for its beauty and grandeur. The
gates, the walls, the buildings, the streets, the monuments, the
fountains, the gardens, unite to proclaim it a masterpiece of skill. The
Architect was he who built the skies.

2\. There is the site where the city is erected. See [Psa
87:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001.md).

3\. There is the date of the city's erection. A halo and a glory attach,
in a case like this, to great antiquity. Now it is long since the city
was built. It was standing in the days of Paul. "Ye are come unto the
city of the living God." [Heb 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022.md).
David was well acquainted with it. [Psa
46:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#004.md). It was standing before the
flood. Noah, Enoch, Abel, dwelt in it. It is almost as old as the
creation.

II\. There are glorious things to tell of the defences of the city. It
has been besieged ever since it was a city at all, and it is not taken
to this hour, "We have a strong city," etc.

III\. There are glorious things in connexion with the stores and
supplies on which the city depends;

1\. their excellence;

2\. their abundance;

3\. their source.

IV\. There are glorious things respecting the King of the city; his
name, person, character, etc.

V. There are glorious things in connexion with the citizens of the city.
- Andrew Gray, 1805-1861.

[Psa 87:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#003.md). -

I. Observe, that a city is not like a flower, a tree, or a plant -
some-thing that grows out of the earth, and is nourished from the earth,
and dependent wholly on its juices. It is an artificial thing,
constructed by wisdom and raised by power, as it was designed by genius
and forethought.

II\. A city upon earth is surrounded generally by walls.

III\. Jerusalem (the must celebrated of cities, from which this figure
is obviously drawn) was built upon the brow of a hill, an extremely
conspicuous and beautiful object.

IV\. In a city there are various buildings, and structures of various
shapes, materials and value: illustrate by the different denominations,
etc.

V. A city has municipal laws.

VI\. It has also trade, traffic, etc.

VII\. The figure, as applied to the Church of Christ, involves the idea
of safety or security, honour, etc.

VIII\. There is also the idea of fewness. - John Gumming, 1843.

[Psa 87:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#003.md). - The things "spoken" of
the city of God.

I. It shall be the permanent and the peculiar residence of God.

II\. It shall be the scene of delightful privileges and blessings.

III\. It shall be invested with absolute and inviolable security.

IV\. It shall possess renown and empire throughout the whole world.

V. Its institutions and existence shall be perfected in the celestial
state. - James Parsons, 1839.

[Psa 87:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004) (last clause.md). -

I. Behold what the "man" was: a native of "Philistia," a heathen, and an
enemy to God.

II\. Behold what happened to him: he "was born there," i.e., new born in
Zion.

III\. Behold what he became - he became by his new birth a freeman and
burgess of Zion, etc.

[Psa 87:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004.md), [Psa
87:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#005.md). -

I. What is not the most honourable birth-place - not Rahab nor Egypt,
nor Babylon, nor any earthly palace or kingdom.

II\. What is? "Of Zion," etc.

1\. Because it is a nobler birth; a being born again of the Spirit of
God.

2\. Because it is a nobler place; the residence of the Highest, and
established for ever. Because it brings nobler rank and privileges. - G.
R.

[Psa 87:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004.md). -

I. Zion shall produce many good and great men.

II\. Zion's interest shall be established by divine power.

III\. Zion's sons shall be registered with honour.

IV\. Zion's songs shall be sung with joy and triumph. - Matthew Henry.

[Psa 87:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004.md). -

I. The excellence of the church is here stated.

II\. Her enlargement is here promised. - J. Scholefield, 1825.

[Psa 87:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#005.md). - The renowned men of the
church of God.

I. Great warriors, who have fought with temptation.

II\. Great poets, whose lives were Psalms.

III\. Great heroes, who have lived and died for Jesus.

IV\. Great kings who have ruled themselves, etc. Apostles, martyrs,
confessors, reformers, men renowned for virtues such as only grace can
produce.

[Psa 87:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#005.md). - "This and that man." The
individuality of true religion.

I. Each soul sins for itself.

II\. Rejects or accepts the Saviour for itself.

III\. Must be judged, and

IV\. Saved or lost individually. The consequent need of personal piety;
the temptations to neglect it; and the habits which promote it.

[Psa 87:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#005) (last clause.md). - The
Established Church of God - her Head, her protection her power, etc.

[Psa 87:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#006.md). -

I. "The Lord" will make the Census.

II\. He will "count" whether a man be rightly there or no.

III\. Every man truly born in Zion shall be admitted on the register.

[Psa 87:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#006.md). -

I. The time referred to. "When he writeth up," etc.; when all the true
Israel is saved.

II\. The account to be taken: "When he writeth up," etc., i.e., revises
and re-enters the names in the Lamb's Book of Life. Compares the called
with the chosen.

III\. The test to be applied.

1\. Their being in Zion, or having the means of grace.

2\. Their being born there.

IV\. The completion of their number: "The Lord shall count." An exact
number of stones in a perfect building and of members in a perfect body.
So in Christ's Church. All make one bride.

V. The notice taken of each one: "This man was born there." Men fell as
a whole; they are saved individually. - G. R.

[Psa 87:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#007.md). -

I. In God our joy.

II\. From God our supplies.

III\. To God our praise.

[Psa 87:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#007) (last clause.md). - All the
springs within me, all the springs which flow for me, are in my God.
There are "upper and nether springs," springs "shut up," "valley"
springs ([Psa 104:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#010).md), rock springs,
etc.; but all these flow from the Lord.

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Title

"A Psalm or Song for the Sons of Korah." The title prefixed is "A Psalm
to be sung by the sons of Korah," i.e. of fallen man. Korah signifies
the state in which trees are during winter, when stript of their verdure
and fruit. In the same sense it is used for the bald head, when age or
sickness has deprived it of its glory and left it without hair. This is
a lively description of fallen man. He has lost his pristine beauty and
fruitfulness. When he left God and turned to his own ways, he became
like the trees of the field in winter, from which the genial warmth of
the sun is withdrawn, or like the head, which by the abating of the
natural heat and rigour is left naked and bald. But being brought to a
right sense of this, and finding himself stript of all the glory which
the first Adam had in paradise, he has been led to seek the restoration
of his nature, and has obtained of the second Adam, the Lord from
heaven, a much better state than he had lost. Every such person is
entitled to sing this sacred hymn, and he is called upon to do it. The
name of the person whom he is to celebrate is not mentioned at first,
but is soon discovered by the character given of him. - William Romaine.

Whole Psalm

Bishop Bruno entitles this Psalm, "The voice of prophecy concerning the
heavenly Jerusalem," that is, the Church of Christ.

[Psa 87:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001.md)

"His foundation is in the holy mountains." The foundation that God has
given his city is in "the holy mountains." What are these holy
mountains? What can they be but the eternal purpose of Jehovah - the
purpose out of which the being of the Church and the whole dispensation
of Divine love have sprung? What but those attributes of mercy, justice,
holiness, and sovereignty, from the ineffable embrace and holy
co-operation of which it comes to pass that his chosen people are
redeemed? What but the promise of life that was given in Christ to the
elect before the world began? What but the everlasting covenant,
"ordered in all things and sure" from which grace and salvation proceed?
What but these things, and Christ himself, the Rock of Ages, on which
rock we know that the Church is so firmly founded, that the gates of
hell cannot prevail against her? Yes, these are the holy mountains,
whereon the city of God is built, and in which its deep and strong
foundations are laid. The sure decree, the divine perfections, the
promise of him that cannot lie, the oath and covenant of God, and the
incarnate Son himself, are the holy mountains, the perpetual hills,
whose summits are gloriously crowned by the city of the Great King.
There the city sits securely, beautiful for situation, the joy of the
whole earth. - Andrew Gray.

[Psa 87:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001.md)

"Mountains." The situation of Jerusalem is in several respects singular
amongst the cities of Palestine. Its elevation is remarkable,
occasioned, not from its being on the summit of one of the numerous
hills of Judaea, like most of the towns and villages, but because it is
on the edge of one of the highest tablelands of the country. Hebron,
indeed, is higher still, by some hundred feet; and from the south,
accordingly, the approach to Jerusalem is by a slight descent. But from
every other side, the ascent is perpetual; and, to the traveller
approaching Jerusalem from the west or east, it must always have
presented the appearance, beyond any other capital of the then known
world - we may add, beyond any important city that has ever existed on
the earth - of a mountain city; breathing, as compared with the sultry
plains of the Jordan or of the coast, a mountain air; enthroned, as
compared with Jericho or Damascus, Gaza or Tyre, on a mountain fastness.
In this respect it concentrated in itself the character of the whole
country of which it was to be the capital - the "mountain throne," the
"mountain sanctuary," of God. "The 'mount' of God is as the 'mount' of
Bashan; an high mount as the mount of Bashan. Why leap ye so, ye high
'mountains'? this is the 'mountain' which God desireth to dwell in"...
It was emphatically the lair of the lion of Judah, of "Ariel," the Lion
of God. "In Judah is God known; his name is great in Israel. In Salem is
his 'leafy covert,' and his 'rocky den' in Zion ... Thou art more
glorious and excellent than the 'mountains of the robbers.'" And this
wild and fastness-like character of Jerusalem was concentrated yet again
in the fortress, the "stronghold" of Zion. That point, the highest in
the city, the height which most readily catches the eye from every
quarter, is emphatically the "hill fort," the "rocky hold" of Jerusalem
- the refuge where first the Jebusite, and then the Lion of God, stood
at bay against the hunters. - Arthur Penrhyn Stanley.

[Psa 87:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001.md), [Psa
87:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#002.md)

If we suppose the Psalm to have been composed in the days of Hezekiah,
it will appear quite intelligible that the Psalmist should break out so
suddenly at the beginning with praise of the security of Zion: he merely
lends his mouth in this case to the full: heart of the people; "The Lord
loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob," is seen
in its true light, for this preference for Sion was at that time
verified - its gates remained closed upon the enemies, while all the
rest of the country was subject to their sway. - E. W. Hengstenberg.

[Psa 87:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#002.md)

"The Lord loveth the gates," etc. The gates of a walled city give access
to it and power over it, and therefore are naturally here put for the
whole. The Hebrew participle (loving) implies constant and habitual
attachment. - J. A. Alexander.

[Psa 87:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#002.md)

"The Lord loveth the gates of Zion." Because of the going out and coming
in of the people of God. Thus indeed the disposition of lovers is shown,
that they are filled with a remarkable affection of love towards those
places through which those whom they love frequently pass, as doors and
gates, and those ways which they daily traverse. What other reason could
God have for loving the gates of Zion? - Musculus.

[Psa 87:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#002.md)

"The gates of Zion" are the doctrines of the Gospel, "the tabernacles of
Jacob" are the teachings of the law, the law was accomplished in the
gospel; therefore it is said that "the Lord loveth the gates of Zion
more than all the dwellings of Jacob." - "Plain Commentary," 1859.

[Psa 87:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#002.md)

"The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more," etc. No doubt the prayers
which the faithful put up to heaven from under their private roofs were
very acceptable unto him; but if a saint's single voice in prayer be so
sweet to God's ear, much more the church choir, his saints' prayers in
concert together. A father is glad to see anyone of his children, and
makes him welcome when he visits him, but much more when they come
together; the greatest feast is when they all meet at his house. The
public praises of the church are the emblem of heaven itself, where all
the angels make but one concert. - William Gurnall.

[Psa 87:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#002.md)

"The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all," etc., It is here
assumed that the Lord loves the dwellings of Jacob - he loves those that
are true Israelites. These are succeeded by the name Christian, for the
Christian Church is now become the true Israel of God. He loves his
saints on account of that image of himself which they bear; he loves
them on account of those graces which are infused into them when they
are renewed by the spirit; he loves them on account of the relation they
stand in to him as his people, and as his church, who are qualified for
the duties or the relation by that love of their Father, that reliance
upon his care, that delight in his person, that enjoyment in his
service, which belongs to dutiful and affectionate children. He loves
them because they imitate his perfections in some humble measure -
because they receive the word of his mouth - because they are ready to
obey every call of his providence, setting themselves in the paths of
his testimony wherever he may direct - because they yield themselves to
God, as those that are alive from the dead, and their bodies as
instruments of righteousness, no longer walking after the deeds of the
flesh, but after the will of God. He takes a delight in them; the Lord
delighteth in the righteous; he knoweth their way; he loves, approves,
and confirms them. The most common occupations of life - the honest
industry of the servants of God, is looked upon by him with approbation.
By these they show forth their Father, and the praises of him who called
them from darkness to light. The most ordinary duties of our calling
become sacrifices to God, and religious duties, when performed in the
spirit, and directed to the great end of glorifying God. He looks with
peculiar complacency on the dwellings of his people on account of those
domestic devotional acknowledgments of his majesty which are there
maintained, when the head walks before his family as a priest to offer
praise and thanksgiving; this attracts peculiar approbation and delight.
He loves to see his people training up their children in the nurture and
admonition of the Lord, and their children walking after them in the
paths of that obedience which he has enjoined. He delights to see the
course of purity which runs in Christian families. He loves to see the
progress which the younger parts of religious families make in piety,
while they grow in grace, and in favour with God and man. He looks down
with peculiar delight on such circles as these: there he deigns his
presence, and bestows peculiar blessings. However obscure the dwellings
of Jacob may be, to him they are open and manifest at all times; and
whether in cottages or in palaces, his eye rests there with complacency;
and he says of such places, "Here will I dwell for ever and ever."
Prayer and devotion sanctify every family, and diffuse a spirit of piety
through all the avocations of life, so that we need not retire from the
world, but are rather called to show forth the virtues of the Christian
life in it.

But it is said, that, although "he loves the dwellings of Jacob," yet
"he loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob" - that
nothing in the dwellings of Jacob so much attracts his attention as the
people of God connected together in a spiritual capacity.

I. In the first place, the Divine Being regards with peculiar
complacency the worship of his saints on its own account.

II\. On account of that union of mind and consent of heart, evinced in
the assembling of God's people together, and constituting themselves
into a church.

III\. Because of the testimony which the church bears toward the truth.

IV\. Upon account of that deference to his authority, which is evinced
by maintaining and keeping up the practice of those institutes which
rest entirely on that authority.

V. By making the assembly of the saints the grand means of conversion.

VI\. That peculiar presence of God is generally vouchsafed to his
saints, and made manifest to them, although it be hidden from the world,
which induces the conviction that God is present of a truth.

VII\. The Divine Being shows his preference of the gates of Zion to the
dwellings of Jacob, by continually maintaining in operation those gifts
which are for the edification of the saints, and without which the union
of the saints would be with difficulty maintained.

VIII\. The Divine Being shews his preference to Zion by that marvellous
protection which is afforded to the interest of the church of God;
whereby, though weak, and frequently reduced to a handful of disciples,
yet they have been protected, and their society on earth continued. -
Robert Hall.

[Psa 87:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#002.md)

Some absent themselves from public worship, under pretence that they can
serve the Lord at home as well in private. How many are apt to say, they
see not but their time may be as well spent at home, in praying, reading
some good book, or discoursing on some profitable subject, as in the use
of ordinances in public assemblies! They see not but private prayer may
be as good to them as public, or private reading and opening the
Scripture as profitable as public preaching; they say of their private
duties, as Naaman of the waters of Damascus, [Kg2
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#012.md) : May I not serve the Lord as
acceptably, with as much advantage, in private exercises of religion?
May I not wash in these and be clean? They see not the great blessings
God has annexed to public worship more than to private. Oh, but if it be
thus, if one be as good as the other, what means the Lord to prefer one
before the other? To what purpose did the Lord choose the gates of Zion,
to place his name there, if he might have been worshipped as well in the
dwellings of Jacob? How do men of this conceit run counter to the Lord?
He prefers the gates of Zion, not only before one or some, but before
all the dwellings of Jacob; and they prefer one such dwelling before the
gates of Zion. - David Clarkson.

[Psa 87:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#003.md)

"Glorious things are spoken" of the people of God. Take the church for a
visible congregation, a mixed congregation; glorious things are spoken
of that. It is the house of God. Take it as visible, "the vessels of
honour and dis-honour," [Ti2 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#020.md), and
the field, the "tares and the wheat," [Mat
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#001.md) etc., it is God's field. Though
we take the church as visible, it hath a glorious name for the good that
is in it, especially for the wheat. But take the church of God for the
company of his children that are gathered by the means of grace,
dwelling in the visible church, enjoying the ordinances: so they are the
house and temple of Christ, "the temple of the Holy Ghost, the body of
Christ: the spouse of Christ." They are God's delight, they are
spiritual kings and priests, etc. The most glorious things that can be,
all other excellencies in the world, are but titular things, mere
shadows of things. There is some little reality in earthly things, but
it is nothing in comparison, it is scarce worth the name of reality, but
Solomon calls them "vanity of vanities." In comparison of the
excellencies of the church all is nothing. I might be large in these
particulars. It is enough to give you the generals of the delights and
excellencies of God's house, "the beauty of the Lord." - Richard Sibbes.

[Psa 87:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#003.md)

"The glories of the wilderness are in thee." The Shechinah, which
appeared upon Sinai, and marshalled the army of the Israelites upon
their journey through the wilderness, has now fixed its residence in
thee, O city of God. Compare [Psa
68:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#017.md). - Samuel Horsley.

[Psa 87:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004.md)

"I will make mention," etc. As if he had said, I do not deny the due
praises which belong to other places and countries, but rather am wont
to make honorable mention of them among my acquaintance; and to allow
that "this man," that is, some one notable person, though comparatively
of no great value, was born in them. - Thomas Fenton.

[Psa 87:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004.md)

"Rahab," a poetical name of Egypt. The same word signifies "fierceness,
insolence, pride"; if Hebrew when applied to Egypt, it would indicate
the national character of the inhabitants. - Smith's Dictionary of the
Bible.

[Psa 87:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004.md)

It should comfort the church that God is able to make her chiefest
enemies to become converts, and that he hath done it sundry times, and
will yet do it more; and that he can take order with those enemies which
shall not be converted, as he did with Rahab and Babylon; for, "I will
make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me," signifieth a
mention-making of them; viz. to the edification of the church's
children, both concerning what God had done in those nations in justice;
and what he would do to them in mercy, or unto other enemies like unto
them. - David Dickson.

[Psa 87:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004.md)

"Rahab," "Babylon," "Philistia," "Tyre," "Ethiopia." This is the glory
of the Church, that into her the fulness of the nations shall enter, -
the proud from Egypt, who for her haughtiness is called Rahab, - the
worldly from Babylon, the city of confusion, - the wrathful from
Philistia, so long the enemies of Israel, - the covetous from Tyre, the
rich city of the traders, - and the slaves of ignorance from Cush, and
from the land of Ham, - all these shall learn the love of Christ and
confess his truth, and shall enter into that all-glorious city, and be
admitted and acknowledged as citizens of the celestial Sion. - "Plain
Commentary."

[Psa 87:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004.md)

By this testimony of the nations here mentioned, we may understand the
testimony of the Gentile Christians in general, though, perhaps, a
special reference is had to that extraordinary scene which took place at
Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost: "And there were dwelling at Jerusalem
Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven. Now when this was
noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because
that every man heard them speak in his own language. And they were all
amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these
which speak Galilaeans? And how hear we every man in our own tongue,
wherein we were born?" [Act 2:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#005.md).

The reader will find that there is a remarkable agreement between the
nations specified in the book of the Acts, and the nations pointed out
in the Psalm before us. Rahab, that is, Egypt, is first mentioned; and
in the Acts we find enumerated, "Egypt and the parts of Libya about
Cyrene;" next Babylon is in the record; and the "Parthians, Medes, and
Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia," were inhabitants of what
once was the Babylonian empire: Philistia is also mentioned; and
"dwellers in Judea" are spoken of in the Acts - "dwellers in Judea"
speaking a different language from what was common at Jerusalem. Who
could these be, so probably, as the inhabitants of the ancient
Philistia, which was in the precincts of the allotment of Judah? Here,
too, perhaps, on account of its port of Joppa, was a grand resort of
"Cretes and Arabians," and "strangers of Rome."

The Grecian settlements of Asia Minor are the only ones specified in the
Acts of the Apostles, which we have not noticed in the Psalm -
"Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia, Phrygia, and Pamphylia:" but what could so
probably indicate these countries, and all who spoke the dialects of the
Grecian tongue, as the great mart of Tyre, in frequenting which, the
Jews would have the most frequent opportunity of intercourse with these
nations? - John Fry.

[Psa 87:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004.md)

"Born in her." The Missionary Society set forth in the Prophets, by our
Lord and by his apostles, is, the Church; and so, whereas our natural
state, after Adam's fall, was alienation from God, and disunion among
ourselves, would He restore "glory to God in the highest and on the
earth peace, good-will towards men," by binding us up in one holy
fellowship, and making the continuance of his blessings dependent upon
that unity, which he imparted and preserves. To adduce the whole proof
for this, would be to go through the whole Old Testament; for the Old
Testament is direct prophecy and type, is one large prophecy of the
Redeemer and his Kingdom or Church. No sooner had disunion multiplied
with the multiplying of men, but in the second generation from Adam, he
formed union through a Church, and "Men began to call upon the name of
the Lord" ([Gen 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#026).md), i.e., they
began to unite in worshipping the Lord, and amid the growing corruption,
religion was no longer entrusted to the insulated care of single
families, but concentrated in a church. And when, after the flood one
righteous man was called out of the fast-corrupting world, unity was
preserved, in that one only was called, but in that one a church was
founded; for this was the reason assigned by God himself: "All the
nations of the earth shall be blessed in him. For I know him, that he
will command his children and his household after him, and they shall
keep the way of the Lord," ([Gen
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#018.md), [Gen
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#019).md). "God called Abraham alone, and
blessed him, and increased him" ([Isa
51:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#002).md), and formed the Jewish Church
out of him, that however it might spread, it might be bound in one by
its origin of one; and he gave it also outward marks and signs between
him and it, which by severing it from others, might keep it one in
itself. The temporal people had their union through a temporal birth of
one, and outward signs; the Christian Church has its unity by a
spiritual birth and inward graces, through the power deposited in her to
give spiritual birth, so that through one mother, we are all born of one
Father, God, and amongst ourselves are brethren, by being members of
One, our ever-blessed Lord.

The unity of the Christian Church and her office of gathering all
nations unto the Lord, are set forth, in many ways, in prophecy. Thus,
in our Psalm, Zion is set forth as the special object of God's love, as
having (in language which anticipates the Gospel) been "founded" by him
"on the holy mountains" as the "city of God," whereof "glorious things
are spoken." And what are these? That she should be the spiritual
birthplace of all nations. It is not merely said, as in other places,
that they should "come to her," should "flow into her," but that they
should be "born in her." "Of Zion it shall be said, This and that man
(i.e. all, one by one) was born in her;" and whence? all the nations of
the earth, Rahab or Egypt, Babylon, Tyre, Ethiopia, Philistia, the most
learned, the most powerful, the wealthiest, the furthest, and her
nearest, oldest and bitterest enemy Philistia, all, being already born
after the flesh, as Egyptians, Babylonians, Ethiopians, Tyrians,
Philistines, should be "born in her," and by being "born there," should
become children of God, citizens of the heavenly Jerusalem, written by
God in the roll of his book. "The Lord shall count, when he writeth up
the people, that this man was born there;" he shall account them as his,
being re-born in his Church.

In like manner, with regard to every prophecy, whereat men's hearts
beat, as an encouragement to Missionary labours. Throughout, it is the
Lord and Saviour of the Church, or the Church itself, filled with his
Spirit, and restored and enlarged, and widening herself by his favour,
and gathering his people into herself, his fold. - E. B. Pusey, in a
Sermon entitled "The Church the converter of the Heathen." 1838.

[Psa 87:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004.md)

It is made the honour and dignity of Sion, that is, of the true Church
of God, to have such and such born in it: "this and that man was born in
her." There are two things signified in this expression, as branches of
their honour; the one is the quality of the persons; and the other is
the number of them. For the quality of them, "this;" for the number of
them, "this and that." To have both of these born in Sion, persons of
note and eminency, and a multitude and plurality of such persons; this
is a part of that dignity and renown which belongs unto it...

And so for the noun, "man;" the Hebrew word אישׁ which is here used for
a man, except qualified by some other word as joined with it, signifies
a man of worth, not a common or ordinary person. The Church brings forth
as these, אנשׁי חשׁם, men of renown, famous and eminent men, and that in
all kinds of perfections, whether natural, or civil, or spiritual; men
of parts, or men of power, or men of piety. There are those in all these
excellencies which have been and still are born in her.

First, take it for natural or acquired abilities; men of parts, and
knowledge, and wisdom, and improved understandings; the church is not
without these, "this man," i.e., this learned man, or this wise man was
born in Sion. All are not idiots who are Christians; no, but there are
some of very rare and admirable accomplishments in all kinds and pieces
of learning and secular knowledge, which are graciously qualified.
There's Paul with his parchments, and Peter with his fisher's net. So
also secondly, take it for civil or secular qualifications; men of
dignity, and power, and estate: "this man," i.e., this honourable man,
נשׁוּא פנים, eminent in countenance, as he is called, [Isa
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#002.md), he is likewise born in Sion; the
mighty man, and the man of war. The Syriac interpreter was so far
sensible of this, as that he expresses it in the very text; and
therefore instead of saying, "This man was born there," he says, "A
potent man was born there, 'and he has established it;'" whereby (as I
conceive), he takes in the word "highest," which follows afterwards in
the verse, and refers it here to this place ... And again, the Chaldee
paraphrast in the text, "This King was born there," understanding
thereby Solomon, as most conceive and apprehend it.

Thirdly, take it for spirituals, and for these accomplishments
especially; "This man," i.e., this godly man; this is that which is most
proper and essential to Sion, and to the being born in it; yea, it is
that which makes Sion itself, in the sense we now take it. It is the
highest perfection of it, and the greatest commendation to it of any
thing else. This is the great honour of the church, that it forms men to
such qualities and dispositions as those are, which no other place does
beside ... As for other places, they may perhaps now and then reach to
some other principles, and those likewise very glorious in the eyes of
the world - morality, and civility, and ingenuity, and smoothness of
behaviour. The school of nature and common reason may sometimes come up
to these, and that in a very great measure; yea, but now go a little
higher, to brokenness of heart, to self-denial, to love of enemies, to
closing with Christ, the frame and spirit of the gospel; this is to be
found nowhere but only in Sion. And here it is, "This man was born
there."

"Behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there."
Here's the excellency of the ordinances, and that power and energy which
is stirring in the Church of Christ; that it is able to work such a
miraculous alteration as this; to bring men from darkness to light, from
Satan to God, from a state of sin and corruption and unregeneracy, to a
state of grace and holiness and regeneration; yea, from the lowest
degree of the one to the highest degree of the other. That Philistia
should turn into Palestina, Tyre into Jerusalem, Ethiopia into Judea;
here's the wonder of all; the reconciling of these two opposite terms
thus both together. That "princes should come out of Egypt," and that
Ethiopia should stretch out her hands to God, as it is in [Psa
68:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#031.md); that the blackamoor should
change his skin, and that the leopard should change his spots; and that
this Ethiopian should become this Christian; that he which was born
there should be born here." - Thomas Horton, in "Zion's Birth-Register
unfolded in a Sermon to the native citizens of London." 1656.

[Psa 87:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004.md)

Foreign nations are here described not as captives or tributaries, not
even as doing voluntary homage to the greatness and glory of Zion, but
as actually incorporated and enrolled, by a new birth, among her sons.
Even the worst enemies of their race, the tyrants and oppressors of the
Jews, Egypt and Babylon, are threatened with no curse, no shout of joy
is raised at the prospect of their overthrow, but the privileges of
citizenship are extended to them, and they are welcomed as brothers. Nay
more, God himself receives each one as a child newly-born into his
family, acknowledges each as his son, and enrols him with his own hand
on the sacred register of his children. It is the mode of anticipating a
future union and brotherhood of all the nations of the earth, not by
conquest, but by incorporation into one state, and by a birth-right so
acquired, which is so remarkable. In some of the prophets, more
especially in Isaiah, we observe the same liberal, conciliatory,
comprehensive language towards foreign states, as Tyre and Ethiopia, and
still more strikingly toward Egypt and Assyria (chap. [Isa
19:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#022).md). But the Psalm stands alone
amongst the writings of the Old Testament, in representing this union of
nations as a new birth unto the city of God ... It is the first
announcement of that great amity of nations, or rather of that universal
common citizenship of which heathen philosophers dreamt, which was "in
the mind of Socrates when he called himself a citizen of the world,"
which had become a common-place of Stoic philosophy, which Judaism tried
finally to realize by the admission of proselytes, through baptism, into
the Jewish community; which Rome accomplished, so far as the external
semblance went, first by subduing the nations, and then by admitting
them to the rights of Roman citizenship. But the true fulfilment of this
hope is to be found only in that kingdom which Christ has set up. He has
gathered into his commonwealth all the kingdoms of the earth. He has
made men one, members of the same family, by teaching them to feel that
they are all children of the same Father. He has made it evident that
the hope of the Jewish singer is no false hope; that there is a Father
in heaven who cares for all, whatever name they bear. Thus the Psalm has
received a better and higher fulfilment than that which lies on the
surface of its words. It was fulfilled in Christ. - J. J. Stewart
Perowne.

[Psa 87:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004.md)

The main thought is that contained in [Psa
87:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004.md), the glorifying of Sion by the
reception of the heathen into the number of its citizens; and a
well-defined form and arrangement of this thought forms the proper
kernel of the Psalm, viz. "Sion, the birth-place of the nations," which
occurs in every one of the three verses ([Psa
87:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004).md), which are bounded by a Selah
behind and before. - E. W. Hengstenberg.

[Psa 87:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#005.md)

"This man." The word rendered "Man" is generally used for a person of
eminence; and the clause "this and that man," is simply, "a Man and a
Man," which some think is used as a peculiar superlative, and means, the
most eminent of men, even the Lord Jesus Christ, and they suppose, that
He, in his divine nature, is "the Highest" who "shall establish the
church." No doubt he is the glory of the church, and of his people
Israel: but his crucifixion was the deepest disgrace imaginable to
Jerusalem itself. - Thomas Scott.

[Psa 87:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#005.md)

"This man." It is well to observe that the word for "man," used here, is
not ארם adam, the common name for man, but אישׁ ish, which is usually
employed when a name is introduced to be designated with distinction and
honour. There are in Hebrew, in fact, three words to designate man, with
varied signification - ארם adam, the common name; אישׁ ish, the name of
excellency and honour; and אנושׁ enosh, man in his weak and inferior
character, as liable to misfortune, misery, and death. The illustrative
discrimination with which these words are respectively employed gives to
many passages of the Hebrew Scripture a force and significance which
cannot be perserved in translation into a language which has but one
word to represent all these meanings - or indeed has no word for man but
the one answering to Adam, unless indeed our "male," in a sense of
dignity and strength, answers in some measure to ish. - John Kitto, in
"The Pictorial Bible."

[Psa 87:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#006.md)

The Lord will "count" (יספּר), record it in a book, when "he writes up
the people" (בּכתוב צעמּים), registers the several nations of the earth;
that "this man was born in" Sion. The Psalmist here describes the
peculiar regard of God to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and figuratively
represents him, as keeping a register of all the nations of the earth,
and marking, as it were, in that register, every one that was a citizen
of Jerusalem, as thereby entitled to his distinguishing favour and
protection. - Samuel Chandler.

[Psa 87:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#006.md)

"This man, was born there." When events shall be traced to their
principles at the last day, many a scene will come forth into
prominence, which now is of little regard. Humble churches will then
prove to have been the birthplace, and stately palaces the graves of
many an immortal soul, while every saved soul will ascribe its springs
of glory to its Redeemer, through the instrumentality of that church,
which he has ordained. - Edward Garrard Marsh.

[Psa 87:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#006.md)

"Selah." The Hebrew text addeth "Selah," which St. Jerome translateth
semper (always). For the Church, as a bride glorious in her husband,
shall evermore be preached of; glorious things shall be spoken of her,
and in her shall be continually sung the ineffable glory of the
everlasting grace of God in Christ our Lord. And so the Jews for the
most part interpret the word "Selah" by "everlasting." This is evident
in their epitaphs, even as the Jewish epitaph is in Hebrew at Basle -
"His soul continues in Paradise, Amen, Amen, Amen, for ever and ever." -
Urbanus Regius \[? Le Roi\] ( - 1541) in "The Solace of Sion."

[Psa 87:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#007.md)

"The singers;" "the players on instruments." Song and music were
prominent features of Divine worship in David's time. This is evident
from the large number of two hundred and eighty-eight Levites who were
expressly appointed for singing and the performance of music. Not less
than two-undred and fifty-five singing men and singing women returned
from the exile ... The chief instruments used by the Levites were,
according to the records of the-Books of Chronicles, cymbals, harps and
lutes: according to [Psa 5:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#001.md)
(title), we should add the flute, which is frequently noticed on
Egyptian monuments. - Augustus F. Tholuck.

[Psa 87:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#007) (First clause.md)

For all its inhabitants are expert musicians; lit. sing like
flute-players. The Hebrews seem to have surpassed all nations in the
skill of poetry and music; and every citizen could sing and dance. This
pre-eminence the Psalmist seems to hint at. - Alexander Geddes.

[Psa 87:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#007.md)

"All my springs are in thee." The original word מעיני, which we render
"springs," is used in a figurative sense, to denote any one's posterity.
Thus [Pro 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#016.md), "Let thy fountains be
dispersed abroad"; i.e., thy posterity be exceeding numerous. And thus
in the place before us: the inhabitants of Jerusalem should triumph and
sing, "All my springs," or fountains, all my friends, my family, my
children, are in thee, are thy citizens, enjoy the glorious privileges
thou art favoured with, are all inserted in God's register, and entitled
to his protection and favour. Thus there is a harmony and connection
between all the parts of this ode, which I think is very intelligible
and poetical. - Samuel Chandler.

[Psa 87:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#007.md)

"All my springs are in thee." Whatever conduit pipe be used, Christ is
the fountain and foundation of every drop of comfort; Christ is the God
of all true consolation. It is not in the power of all the angels of
heaven to give any soul one drop of comfort, nor can all on earth give
you one dram of comfort. They can speak the words of comfort, but they
cannot cause the soul to receive comfort. God comforts by them, [Co2
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#006.md). Titus was but an instrument.
Comforting is called frequently in Scripture the speaking to the heart,
[Hos 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#014.md). Who is able to speak to the
heart but he who is the Lord and commander of the heart? God hath put
all the oil of spiritual joy into the hands of Christ, [Isa
61:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003.md), and none but he can give it out.
He that wants comfort must go to Christ, he that hath received any true
comfort must ascribe it to Christ. "All my springs," saith the Church,
"are in thee." - Ralph Robinson.

[Psa 87:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#007.md)

The silver springs of grace, and the golden springs of glory are in him.
- Thomas Watson.

[Psa 87:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#007.md)

"Springs." The meaning of this verse is obscure, partly from its abrupt
brevity, and partly from the ambiguity of one word. The word "springs"
is, beyond all controversy, to be here taken metaphorically; but
interpreters are not agreed as to the explanation of the metaphor. Some
understand it as denoting hopes, some affections, and others thoughts.
Did the idiom of the language admit, I would willingly subscribe to the
opinion of those who translate it melodies or songs. But as this might
be considered unsupported by the usage of the Hebrew term, I am rather
inclined to adopt, as most suitable to the subject in hand, the opinion
that lookings is the proper translation, the root of the word signifying
an eye. It is as if the Psalmist had said, I will always be earnestly
looking, as it were, with fixed eyes upon thee. - John Calvin.

[Psa 87:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#007.md)

"My springs."

Whether songs or melodies

In Thee are all my well-springs.

This passage is given obscurely in most of the versions; it is here
rendered strictly, and, as the author hopes, perspicuously. As the
Greeks had their Pierian springs, their fountain of Aganippe dedicated
to the Muses, Jerusalem had, in like manner, her sacred springs, her
fountains of inspiration, in a much higher degree. It is to these the
holy bard alludes in the passages before us, as Milton does in the
following, who has perhaps copied from the present in his address to the
"Heavenly Muse":

"Or if Zion's hill

Delight thee more, or Siloa's fount that flowed

Hard by the oracle of God, I thence

Invoke thine aid to my adventurous song."

\- John Mason Good.

[Psa 87:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#007.md)

"All my springs." Fitly may we here quote the delightful hymn of Robert
Robinson which has puzzled so many, but which has in it a fine classical
allusion to Hippocrene and Mount Parnassus.

"Come, thou fount of every blessing,

Tune my heart to sing Thy grace,

Streams of mercy, never ceasing,

Call for songs of loudest praise.

Teach me some melodious sonnet,

Sung by flaming tongues above:

Praise the mount - oh fix me on it,

Mount of God's unchanging love."

\- C. H. S.

[Psalms 87:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 87:1</span></span>

1 His foundation is in the holy mountains.

2 The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of
Jacob.

3 Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.

4 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold
Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there.

5 And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her: and
the highest himself shall establish her.

6 The Lord shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this man was
born there. Selah.

7 As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there: all
my springs are in thee.

[Psa 87:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001.md)

"His foundation is in the holy mountains." The Psalm begins abruptly,
the poet's heart was full, and it gained vent on a sudden.

"God's foundation stands for ever

On the holy mountain towers;

Sion's gates Jehovah favours

More than Jacob's thousand bowers."

Sudden passion is evil, but bursts of holy joy are most precious. God
has chosen to found his earthly temple upon the mountains; he might have
selected other spots, but it was his pleasure to have his chosen abode
upon Zion. His election made the mountains holy, they were by his
determination ordained and set apart for the Lord's use.

The foundation of the church, which is the mystical Jerusalem, is laid
in the eternal, immutable, and invincible decrees of Jehovah. He wills
that the church shall be, he settles all arrangements for her calling,
salvation, maintenance and perfection and all his attributes like the
mountains round about Jerusalem, lend their strength for her support.
Not on the sand of carnal policy, nor in the morass of human kingdoms,
has the Lord founded his church, but on his own power and godhead, which
are pledged for the establishment of his beloved church, which is to him
the chief of all his works. What a theme for meditation is the founding
of the church of God in the ancient covenant engagements of eternity;
the abrupt character of [Psa 87:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001.md)
indicates long consideration on the part of the writer, leading up to
his bursting forth in wonder and adoration. Well might such a theme
cause his heart to glow. Rome stands on her seven hills and has never
lacked a poet's tongue to sing her glories, but more glorious far art
thou, O Ziona, among the eternal mountains of God: while pen can write
or mouth can speak, thy praises shall never lie buried in inglorious
silence.

[Psa 87:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#002.md)

"The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of
Jacob." The gates are put for the city itself. The love of God is
greatest to his own elect nation, descended from his servant Jacob, yet
the central seat of his worship is dearer still; no other supposable
comparison could have so fully displayed the favour which Jehovah bore
to Jerusalem, - he loves Jacob best and Zion better than the best. At
this hour the mystical teaching of these words is plain. God delights in
the prayers and praises of Christian families and individuals, but he
has a special eye to the assemblies of the faithful, and he has a
special delight in their devotions in their church capacity. The great
festivals, when the crowds surrounded the temple gates, were fair in the
Lord's eyes, and even such is the general assembly and church of the
first-born, whose names are written in heaven. This should lead each
separate believer to identify himself with the church of God; where the
Lord reveals his love the most, there should each believer most delight
to be found. Our own dwellings are very dear to us, but we must not
prefer them to the assemblies of the saints; we must say of the church -

"Here my best friends, my kindred dwell:

Here God, my Saviour reigns."

[Psa 87:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#003.md)

"Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God." This is true of
Jerusalem. Her history, which is the story of the nation of which she is
the capital, is full of glorious incidents, and her use and end as the
abode of the true God, and of his worship, was pre-eminently glorious.
Glorious things were taught in her streets, and seen in her temples.
Glorious things were foretold of her, and she was the type of the most
glorious things of all. This is yet more true of the church: she is
founded in grace, but her pinnacles glow with glory. Men may glory in
her without being braggarts, she has a lustre about her brow which none
can rival. Whatever glorious things the saints may say of the church in
their eulogies, they cannot exceed what prophets have foretold, what
angels have sung, or what God himself has declared. Happy are the
tongues which learn to occupy themselves with so excellent a subject,
may they be found around our fire-sides, in our market-places, and in
all the spots where men most congregate. Never let thy praises cease, O
thou bride of Christ, thou fairest among women, thou in whom the Lord
himself hath placed his delight, calling thee by that pearl of names,
Hephzibah, - "for my delight is in her." Since the Lord has chosen thee,
and deigns to dwell in thee, O thou city of beauty, none can rival thee,
thou art the eye of the world, the pearl, the queen of all the cities of
the universe; the true "eternal city," the metropolitan, the mother of
us all. The years to come shall unveil thy beauties to the astonished
eyes of all peoples, and the day of thy splendour shall come to its
sevenfold noon.

"Selah." With the prospect before him of a world converted, and the most
implacable foes transformed into friends, it was meet that the Psalmist
should pause. How could he sing the glories of new-born Tyre and
Ethiopia, received with open arms into union with Zion, until he had
taken breath and prepared both voice and heart for so divine a song.

[Psa 87:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004.md)

"I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me." This
shall be a glorious subject to speak of concerning Zion, that her old
foes are newborn and have become her friends, worshipping in the temple
of her God. Rahab or Egypt which oppressed Israel shall become a sister
nation, and Babylon in which the tribes endured their second great
captivity, shall become a fellow-worshipper; then shall there be mention
made in familiar talk of the old enmities forgotten and the new
friendships formed. Some consider that these are the words of God
himself, and should be rendered "I will mention Rahab and Babylon as
knowing me" but we feel content with our common version, and attribute
the words to the Psalmist himself, who anticipates the conversion of the
two great rival nations and speaks of it with exultation. "Behold
Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia." These also are to bow before the
Lord. Philistia shall renounce her ancient hate, Tyre shall not be
swallowed up by thoughts of her commerce, and distant Ethiopia shall not
be too far off to receive the salvation of the Lord, "This man was born
there." The word man is inserted by the translators to the marring of
the sense, which is clear enough when the superfluous word is dropped, -
"Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this was born there" - i.e., this
nation has been born into Zion, regenerated into the church of God. Of
the new births of nations we will make mention, for it is at once a
great blessing and a great wonder. It is a glorious thing indeed when
whole nations are born unto God.

"Mark ye well Philistia's legions,

Lo, to seek the Lord they come;

And within the sacred regions

Tyre and Cush have found a home."

Many understand the sense of these verses to be that all men are proud
of their native country, and so also is the citizen of Zion, so that
while of one it is said, "he was born in Egypt" and of another, "he came
from Ethiopia," it would be equally to the honour of others that they
were home-born sons of the city of God. The passage is not so clear that
any one should become dogmatical as to its meaning, but we prefer the
interpretation given above.

[Psa 87:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#005.md)

"And of Zion, it shall be said, This and that man was born in her." Not
as nations only, but one by one, as individuals, the citizens of the New
Jerusalem shall be counted, and their names publicly declared. Man by
man will the Lord reckon them, for they are each one precious in his
sight; the individual shall not be lost in the mass, but each one shall
be of high account. What a patent of nobility is it, for a man to have
it certified that he was born in Zion; the twice born are a royal
priesthood, the true aristocracy, the imperial race of men. The
original, by using the noblest word for man, intimates that many
remarkable men will be born in the church, and indeed every man who is
renewed in the image of Christ is an eminent personage, while there are
some, who, even to the dim eyes of the world, shine forth with a lustre
of character which cannot but be admitted to be unusual and admirable.
The church has illustrious names of prophets, apostles, martyrs,
confessors, reformers, missionaries and the like, which bear comparison
with the grandest names honoured by the world, nay, in many respects far
excel them. Zion has no reason to be ashamed of her sons, nor her sons
of her. "Wisdom is justified of her children." "And the highest himself
shall establish her" - the only establishment worth having. When the
numbers of the faithful are increased by the new birth, the Lord proves
himself to be the upbuilder of the church. The Lord alone deserves to
wear the title of Defender of the Faith; he is the sole and sufficient
Patron and Protector of the true church. There is no fear for the Lord's
heritage, his own arm is sufficient to maintain his rights. The Highest
is higher than all those who are against us, and the good old cause
shall triumph over all.

[Psa 87:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#006.md)

"The Lord shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this man was
born there." At the great census which the Lord himself shall take, he
will number the nations without exception and make an exact registry of
them, whether they were by their natural descent Babylonians or Tyrians,
or other far-off heathen. May it be our happy lot to be numbered with
the Lord's chosen both in life and death, in the church-roll below, and
in the church-roll above. Jehovah's census of his chosen will differ
much from ours; he will count many whom we should have disowned, and he
will leave out many whom we should have reckoned. His registration is
infallible. Let us pray then for that adoption and regeneration which
will secure us a place among the heaven-born. It was thought to be a
great honour to have one's name written in the golden book of the
Republic of Venice, kings and princes paid dearly for the honour, but
the book of life confers far rarer dignity upon all whose names are
recorded therein.

[Psa 87:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#007.md)

In vision the Psalmist sees the citizens of Zion rejoicing at some:
sacred festival, and marching in triumphant procession with vocal and
instrumental music; . - "As well the singers as the players on
instruments shall be there." Where God is there must be toy, and where
the church is increased by numerous conversions the Joy becomes
exuberant and finds out ways of displaying itself. Singers and dancers,
Psalmists and pipers, united their efforts and made a joyful procession
to the temple, inspired not by Bacchus, or by the Castalian fount, but
by draughts from the sacred source of all good, of which they each one
sing "All my springs are in thee." Did the poet mean that henceforth he
would find all his joys in Zion, or that to the Lord he would look for
all inspiration, comfort, strength, joy, life and everything. The last
is the truest doctrine. Churches have not such all-sufficiency within
them that we can afford to look to them for all, but the Lord who
founded the church is the eternal source of all our supplies, and
looking to him we shall never flag or fail. How truly does all our
experience lead us to look to the Lord by faith, and say "all my fresh
springs are in thee." The springs of my faith and all my graces; the
springs of my life and all my pleasures; the springs of my activity and
all its right doings; the springs of my hope, and all its heavenly
anticipations, all lie in thee, my Lord. Without thy Spirit I should be
as a dry well, a mocking cistern, destitute of power to bless myself or
others. O Lord, I am assured that I belong to the regenerate whose life
is in thee, for I feel that I cannot live without thee; therefore, with
all thy joyful people will I sing thy praises.

"With joy shall sing the choral train,

The minstrels breathe the answering strain:

'O Zion, Zion, fair, I see

The fountains of my bliss in thee.'"
