### [Psalms Chapter 61](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 61:0</span></span>

Title. - To the Chief Musician upon Neginah, a Psalm of David. - The
original indicates that both the hymns and the musical instrument were
David's. He wrote the verses, and himself sang them to the stringed
instrument whose sound he loved so well. We have left the Psalms
entitled Michtam, but we shall still find much precious meaning though
the golden name be wanting. We have met with the title of this Psalm
before, in [Psa 5:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#001.md), [Psa
6:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001.md), [Psa
54:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#001.md), and 55, but with this
difference, that in the present case the word is in the singular number:
the Psalm itself is very personal, and well adapted for the private
devotion of a single individual.

Subject and Division. - This Psalm is a pearl. It is little, but
precious. To many a mourner it has furnished utterance when the mind
could not have devised speech for itself. It was evidently composed by
David after he had come to the throne - see [Psa
61:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#006.md). The [Psa
61:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#002.md) leads us to believe that it was
written during the Psalmist's enforced exile from the tabernacle, which
was the visible abode of God: so, the period of Absalom's rebellion has
been most suitably suggested as the date of its authorship, and
Delitzsch is correct in entitling it, "Prayer and thanksgiving of an
expelled King on his way back to his throne."

We might divide the verses according to the sense, but it is preferable
to follow the author's own arrangement, and make a break at each Selah.

existence, our personal joy in this, and our Joy for our descendants.

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Title

The word Neginah (the singular of Neginoth) may be understood to be
synonymous with the kinnor or harp: that is to say, the instrument of
eight strings, probably played with a bow or plectrum. - John Jebb.

[Psa 61:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#001.md)

"Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer." Aquinas saith that some
read the words thus, Intende ad cantica mea, attend unto my songs and so
the words may be safely read, from the Hebrew word, רנה ranah, which
signifies to shout or shrill out for joy - to note that the prayers of
the saints are like pleasant songs and delightful ditties in the ears of
God. No mirth, no music, can be so pleasing to us as the prayers of the
saints are pleasing to God. Cant. ii. 14; [Psa
141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002.md). - Thomas Brooks.

[Psa 61:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#001.md)

"My cry." There is a text in Job where the "hypocrites in heart" are
spoken of condemningly, because "they cry not when he bindeth them." I
like to feel that no hard fortitude is required of the chastened child
of God, but that it ought to feel, and may cry, under the rod, without a
single rebellious thought. - Mary B. M. Duncan.

[Psa 61:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#001.md), [Psa
61:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#002.md)

One ejaculation begetteth another. "Hear my cry" "attend unto my prayer"
(yet no words hereof mentioned); and [Psa
61:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#002.md). "From the end of the earth will
I cry:" he had thus cried, and he will therefore cry again and again. As
billows of temptation ever and anon stop his mouth and interrupt him, so
as he now and then doth but peep above water, and get breathing space,
he will thus cry, "Lead me," or "guide me," or carry me to yonder "rock
which is higher than I." - Thomas Cobbet (1608-1686), on Prayer.

[Psa 61:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#002.md)

"From the end of the earth." This may be taken two ways: either
naturally, and then it is an allusion to men that are far distant and
remote from help, relief and comfort; or, as I may say,
ecclesiastically, with reference to the temple of God, which was "in
medio terrae," "in the midst and heart of the land," where God
manifested and gave tokens of his gracious presence and favour: as if he
had said, "I am at the end of the earth; far from any tokens, pledges,
or manifestations of the love and favour of God, as well as from outward
help and assistance." - John Owen.

[Psa 61:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#002.md)

"The end of the earth." What place was this, "the end of the earth,"
referring the expression to the writer of the Psalm? We know that the
centre of the affections and devotions of the pious Israelite was the
"holy city, Jerusalem; whither the tribes went up, even the tribes of
the Lord, to testify unto Israel, and to give thanks unto the name of
the Lord." The country of which this city was the capital, was to the
Jew the world; it was the world within the world; the earth within the
earth; the whole globe beside was to him a waste, a place out of the
world; an extra-terrestrial territory, beyond the limits set up by the
Lord Almighty, Thus in Holy Writ what is called the world, or the earth,
frequently signifieth only that part thereof which was the heritage of
the chosen people "The end of the earth," then, as referred to the
Psalmist, would signify any place of bodily absence from the temple
where the Deity had taken up his special abode, or any place whence his
spiritual affections were unable to reach that temple. As referred to
us, the expression signifies any sensible distance from God: for as God
is the centre of life, hope, love, and joy, distance from him, of
whatsoever degree, is the antipodes of the soul, a region of sterility
and darkness; the Iceland of man's spirit. - Alfred Bowen Evans, 1852.

[Psa 61:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#002.md)

"I will cry unto thee." There is in this expression an endeavor to
approach unto God; as you do when you "cry" after one whom you see at a
distance, and are afraid he will go farther from you. It is the great
work of faith to cry out after God, at a distance, when you are afraid
lest at the next turn he should be quite out of sight. Crying to the
Lord supposes him to be withdrawing or departing. - John Owen.

[Psa 61:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#002.md)

"Cry." No matter how abrupt the prayer be, so it be the representation
of our hearts. Thus did David. Where doth he pray? In banishment. When?
When his spirit "is overwhelmed." How doth he pray? He "cried." Thus
Hannah prayed herself into a composed state of mind. Remember,
resignation is the work of the Spirit of God; and therefore you must
plead for it before you have it. - John Singleton ( - 1706), in "The
Morning Exercises."

[Psa 61:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#002.md)

"Cry." Crying is a substitute for speech; and also the expression of
earnestness. - William Jay.

[Psa 61:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#002.md)

"When my heart is overwhelmed." Troubles are of various kinds; some are
provoking, some are gnawing, some are perplexing, and some are
overwhelming; but whatever form they assume, they are troubles, and are
part of the wear and tear of life.... Overwhelming troubles are such as
sweep over a man, just as the mighty billows of the ocean sweep over and
submerge the sands. These are troubles which struggle with us, as it
were, for life and death; troubles which would leave us helpless wrecks;
troubles which enter into conflict with us in our prime, which grapple
with us in our health and strength, and threaten to conquer us by sheer
force, no matter how bravely we may contend. Such trouble the Psalmist
knew. - Philip Bennett Power, in "The 'I wills' of the Psalms," 1861.

[Psa 61:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#002.md)

"Heart." The heart is here represented to us as being overwhelmed, or,
as it is otherwise translated, "covered over;" it is smothered in,
unable to perform its functions with proper action, unable to throw out
the blood to the extremities, to give them needed vitality and power for
necessary effort. When the action of the heart is paralyzed, even
temporally, it will tell upon all the members, a chill there sends its
cold vibration through every limb; Satan knows this well, and so all his
dealings are heart dealings, efforts to paralyze the very spring of life
itself. This is precisely what we ourselves have experienced; we have
partially felt death within us, we have felt a gradual numbing of our
heart; a gradual diminution in the quickness of its beat; a gradual
closing in, and pressure of a weight upon it, and this was the
"overwhelming" process. - Philip Bennett Power.

[Psa 61:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#002.md)

"Lead me to the rock that is higher than I." The tower, in [Psa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002.md), is "an high tower," and the rock
is here an high rock, the rock "higher than I;" and yet there is a way
to get into the highest towers; by scaling ladders a man may get over
the high walls of towers. This tower and rock were too high for David
himself to get into, and therefore he sets to the scaling ladder. "Lead
me to the rock, and into the tower that is higher than I. Hear my cry,
attend unto my prayer." So he makes prayer the scaling ladder to get
upon that rock and into that tower that otherwise had been too high for
him; he gets that safety and deliverance which otherwise but by prayer
unto God had been impossible to have been obtained. - Jeremiah Dyke.

[Psa 61:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#002.md)

"Lead me to the rock that is higher than I." The language is very
remarkable. It gives us the idea of a man suffering shipwreck. The
vessel in which he has been sailing has sunk. He has been plunged into
the mighty ocean; and there he is buffeting the waves, struggling for
life, panting for breath, and just about to give up all for lost.
Suddenly he discovers a rock towering above him. If he can but climb up
to the top of it, and get sure footing upon it, the billows will not be
able to reach him, and he will be safe. Now, the prayer in our text is
the cry of that poor wretch for help. He is so spent and exhausted, that
he cannot reach the rock himself. He shouts aloud for the friendly hand
of some one stronger than himself, or for a rope that may be flung to
him by those who are already safe on the rock, if by these helps he may
gain it. "Lead me to the rock," cries the poor perishing wretch. "O,
lead me, guide me, direct me to it; for I am so worn and spent, that I
cannot reach it otherwise. I am at the point to die; and I must sink,
and be no more seen for ever, if there is none to help me." Thus he
calls for some one to rescue him from the deep, and to place him on the
"rock," But what rock? He knows that unless the rock be a high one, he
will not be in safety, though he should be on it. "The rock," he says,
"must be higher than I, or the waves will reach me, and wash me off
again." It is not a rock, the top of which just shows itself above the
sea, no higher than a man's own body, that will save the life of a
shipwrecked mariner. Such a rock may occasion the wreck, but it will not
afford any help to the sufferers afterwards; it is a rock to split upon
for destruction, not to stand upon for safety. "Lead me to the rock," or
as it is in the Prayer-book version, "Set me upon the rock, that is
higher than I!"... The text having shown us the danger of sin, does not
leave us comfortless; it shows us the security of the refuge. We have
before remarked, that the prayer of David, as a shipwrecked man, is, to
be "led to," and set upon, a "rock," that is higher than himself. The
expression seems to imply much. The rock that is higher than he, must be
higher than any man; for David was a mighty monarch. He implies,
therefore, that the refuge he seeks must be more than any "arm of flesh"
can afford him; it must be therefore divine. - Condensed from a Sermon
by Fountain Elwin, 1842.

[Psa 61:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#002.md)

It is more the image of one overtaken by the tide, as he is hastening
onwards to get beyond its reach, and yet with every step he sees it
rolling nearer and nearer to him; he hears its angry roar, the loosening
sand sinks beneath his tread - a few minutes more, and the waves will be
around him; despair hath "overwhelmed his heart;" when in the very
depths of his agony he sees a point of rock high above the waves. "O
that I could reach it and be safe!" And then comes the cry, the
agonising cry, to him that is mighty to save, "Lead me to the rock that
is higher than I." It is the sinner's cry to the sinner's Saviour! -
Barton Bouchier, A.M., in "Manna in the Heart; or, Daily Comments on the
Book of Psalms," 1855.

[Psa 61:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#002.md)

"Lead me to the rock." If we would find ourselves upon the rock, and
enjoy the realisation of being so, we must be dependent upon another's
hand. And that hand can do everything for us, even in our worst of
times. When we are so blinded by the salt waves that dash in our eyes,
so reeling in brain that we cannot perhaps think, much less make
continuous efforts, there is a hand which can lead us, which can draw us
out of the waters, which can set our feet upon the rock. Surely we have
already experienced the power and tenderness of that hand? and it may be
that in the reader's case, the Waves, as they made sure of their prey,
found it supernaturally drawn forth from them, that it might be set upon
a rock, immovable amid all waters, and sufficient amid all storms. -
Philip Bennett Power.

[Psa 61:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#002.md)

"The rock that is higher than I." The rock of our salvation, then, is
"higher than we." Here we have the Deity of Christ, the Rock, set forth;
in this he is "higher than we." And except as he is thus higher, as he
is God, he could not be a Saviour; for "He is a just God, as well as a
Saviour." A being no higher than we, or but a little higher, as the
angels (for we are but "a little lower than they"), though he might
teach us, or warn us, or console us, could never save us. The prey is in
the hands of the mighty, and the Almighty alone is mightier. But a rock
is not only high, but deep; it not only erects its front above the
waves, but its base is fixed in the ocean's bed. "Canst thou by
searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto
perfection? It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than
hell; what canst thou know? The measure thereof is longer than the
earth, and broader than the sea." [Job
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#007.md). Here we have the humanity of him
who is the rock; that humanity by which he was able to go down to the
deeps, as well as ride triumphantly on the bosom of the waters - those
deeps, whereof David speaking experimentally of himself, spake
prophetically of him; the depths of our fall and degradation - that
humanity in which he went down into the grave, into the recesses of the
intermediate state, and "preached to the spirits in prison." This is our
rock, both deep and high; the rock of our salvation; to which those
whose sins have set them at "the end of the earth," desire to be
brought, that they may find a place of safe standing. Let not those fear
who feel the bitterness of distance from God, for they shall be brought
nigh; desolate may be the coast to which they are driven, but over
against it is the Paradise of God; clouds and darkness may gather at the
base of this rock of safety, but "eternal sunshine settles on its head."
- Alfred Bowen Evans.

[Psa 61:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#002.md)

"Higher." A hiding place must be locus excelsissimus. Your low houses
are soon scaled. Jesus Christ is a high place; he is as high as heaven.
He is the Jacob's ladder that reacheth from earth to heaven. [Gen
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#012.md). He is too high for men, too
high for devils; no creature can scale these high walls. - Ralph
Robinson (1614-1655), in "Christ All and in All."

[Psa 61:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#004.md)

"I will abide in thy tabernacle." Some render it, I shall dwell in thy
tent or pavilion royal, making it a metaphor from warfare, where those
that are in the king's own tent must needs be in greatest safety. And
this sense suiteth well with the following words: "I will trust in the
covert of thy wings." - John Trapp.

[Psa 61:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#004.md)

"Covert of thy wings." To a person who should penetrate the Holy of
Holies in the tabernacle, the most conspicuous object would be the
outspread wings above the mercy-seat: under their shelter and upon the
mercy-seat David would abide in quiet confidence. - C. H. S.

[Psa 61:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#005) (first clause.md)

About this time I began to know that there is a God who hears and
answers prayer. - John Newton, in his Journal.

[Psa 61:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#005.md)

"Thou, O God, hast heard my vows:" that is, his prayers, which are
always to be put up with vows. Indeed, that prayer is a blank which hath
not a vow in it. Is it a mercy thou prayest him to give? If sincere,
thou wilt vow to praise him for it, and serve him with it. Is it a sin
thou prayest against? Except thou jugglest with God, thou wilt vow as
well as pray against it. - William Gurnall.

[Psa 61:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#005.md)

"The heritage." Eternal life is called an inheritance. Theodoret
remarks: "The true inheritance is eternal life, concerning which Christ
saith to the sheep on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father,
inherit the kingdom prepared for you before the foundation of the world.
This inheritance the Lord giveth to them that fear him." In [Eph
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#014.md), the Spirit is called "the
earnest of our inheritance." In [Col
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#012.md), the apostle exhorts them "to
give thanks unto the Father, who hath made them meet to be partakers of
the inheritance of the saints in light." On this verse we have the
golden comment of Chrysostom, reiterated by Theophylact. He calls it an
inheritance, to show that no man obtaineth the kingdom by his own good
works; for no man hath so lived as to render himself worthy of the
kingdom, but all is of the grace of God. Wherefore, he saith, "When ye
have done all, say that we are unprofitable servants, for we have only
done what we ought to have done." - John Casper Suicer's "Thesaurus,"
1728.

[Psa 61:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#006.md)

"Thou wilt prolong the king's life," etc. David cannot be considered as
using these words of gratulation with an exclusive reference to himself.
It is true that he lived to an extreme old age, and died full of days,
leaving the kingdom in a settled condition, and in the hands of his son,
who succeeded him; but he did not exceed the period of one man's life,
and the greater part of it was spent in continued dangers and anxieties.
There can be no doubt, therefore, that the series of years, and even
ages, of which he speaks, extends prospectively to the coming of Christ,
it being the very condition of the kingdom, as I have often remarked;
that God maintained them as one people under one head, or when
scattered, united them again. The same succession still subsists in
reference to ourselves. Christ must be viewed as living in his members
to the end of the world. To this Isaiah alludes, when he says, "Who
shall declare his generation or age?" - words in which he predicts that
the church would survive through all ages, notwithstanding the incessant
danger of destruction to which it is exposed through the attacks of its
enemies, and the many storms assailing it. So here David foretells the
uninterrupted succession of the kingdom down to the time of Christ. -
John Calvin.

[Psa 61:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#006.md)

"The king's life: and his years." David speaks designedly of the days of
the "king" instead of his own days, as might have been expected from
what had been said, for the purpose of showing that he considered the
promise of eternal dominion as relating not to himself personally, but
to his family - the royal family of David. - E. W. Hengstenberg.

[Psa 61:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#007.md)

"O prepare mercy." David having declared in his own behalf the purpose
of God towards him for everlasting salvation, "he," speaking of himself,
"shall abide before God for ever:" he withal considering what he was to
run through in this life, and what it might require to keep him unto the
end, and so "for ever," doth presently thereupon, in way of prayer,
subjoin, "O prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve me." As if he
had said, I have yet a long journey to go, and through many hazards, and
thy promise is, I shall abide afore thee for ever. Lord, thou hast need
lay up and aforehand prepare an abundance of mercy and truth to preserve
me for time to come. - Thomas Goodwin.

[Psa 61:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#008.md)

They that are godly are oppressed and vexed in the church or
congregation for this purpose: that when they are pressed, they should
cry; and when they cry, that they should be heard; and when they are
heard, that they should laud and praise God. - Augustine.

[Psalms 61:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 61:1</span></span>

1 Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.

2 From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is
overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I.

3 For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the
enemy.

4 I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of
thy wings. Selah.

[Psa 61:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#001.md)

"Hear my cry, O God." He was in terrible earnest; he shouted, he lifted
up his voice on high. He is not however content with the expression of
his need: to give his sorrows vent is not enough for him, he wants
actual audience of heaven, and manifest succour as the result. Pharisees
may rest in their prayers; true believers are eager for an answer to
them: ritualists may be satisfied when they have "said or sung" their
litanies and collects, but living children of God will never rest till
their supplications have entered the ears of the Lord God of Sabaoth.
"Attend unto my prayer." Give it thy consideration, and such an answer
as thy wisdom sees fit. When it comes to crying with us, we need not
doubt but that it will come to attending with God. Our heavenly Father
is not hardened against the cries of his own children. What a consoling
thought it is that the Lord at all times hears his people's cries, and
is never forgetful of their prayers; whatever else fails to move him,
praying breath is never spent in vain!

[Psa 61:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#002.md)

"From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee." lie was banished from
the spot which was the centre of his delight, and at the same time his
mind was in a depressed and melancholy condition; both actually and
figuratively he was an outcast, yet he does not therefore restrain
prayer, but rather finds therein a reason for the louder sad more
importunate cries. To be absent from the place of divine worship was a
sore sorrow to saints in the olden times; they looked upon the
tabernacle as the centre of the world, and they counted themselves to be
at the fag-end of the universe when they could no longer resort to the
sacred shrine; their heart was heavy as in a strange land when they were
banished from its solemnities. Yet even they knew right well that no
place is unsuitable for prayer. There may be an end of the earth, but
there must not be an end to devotion. On creation's verge we may call
upon God, for even there he is within call. No spot is too dreary, no
condition too deplorable; whether it be the world's end or life's end,
prayer is equally available. To pray in some circumstances needs
resolve, and the Psalmist here expresses it, "I will cry." It was a wise
resolution, for had he ceased to pray he would have become the victim of
despair; there is an end to a man when he makes an end to prayer.
Observe that David never dreamed of seeking any other God; he did not
imagine the dominion of Jehovah to be local: he was at the end of the
promised land, but he knew himself to be still in the territory of the
Great King; to him only does he address his petitions. "When my heart is
overwhelmed:" - when the huge waves of trouble wash over me, and I am
completely submerged, not only as to my head, but also my heart. It is
hard to pray when the very heart is drowning, yet gracious men plead
best at such times. Tribulation brings us to God, and brings God to us.
Faith's greatest triumphs are achieved in her heaviest trials. It is all
over with me, affliction is all over me; it encompasses me as a cloud,
it swallows me up like a sea, it shuts me in with thick darkness, yet
God is near, near enough to hear my voice, and I will call him. Is not
this brave talk? Mark how our Psalmist tells the Lord, as if he knew he
were hearing him, that he intended to call upon him: our prayer by
reason of our distress may be like to a call upon a far-off friend, but
our inmost faith has its quiet heart-whispers to the Lord as to one who
is assuredly our very present help.

"Lead me to the rock that is higher than I." I see thee to be my refuge,
sure and strong; but alas! I am confused, and cannot find thee; I am
weak, and cannot climb thee. Thou art so steadfast, guide me; thou art
so high, uplift me. There is a mine of meaning in this brief prayer.
Along the iron-bound coast of our northern shores, lives are lost
because the rocks are inaccessible to the shipwrecked mariner. A
clergyman of one of the coast villages has With immense labour cut steps
up from the beach to a large chamber, which he has excavated in the
chalk cliff: here many mariners have been saved; they have climbed the
rock, which had else been too high for them, and they have escaped. We
have heard of late, however, that the steps have been worn away by the
storms, and that poor sailors have perished miserably within sight of
the refuge which they could not reach, for it was too high for them: it
is therefore proposed to drive in iron stanchions, and to hang up chain
ladders that shipwrecked mariners may reach the chambers in the rock.
The illustration is self-interpreting. Our experience leads us to
understand this verse right well, for the time was with us when we were
in such amazement of soul by reason of sin, that although we knew the
Lord Jesus to be a sure salvation for sinners, yet we could not come at
him, by reason of our many doubts and forebodings. A Saviour would have
been of no use to us if the Holy Spirit had not gently led us to him,
and enabled us to rest upon him. To this day we often feel that we not
only want a rock, but to be led to it. With this in view we treat very
leniently the haft-unbelieving prayers of awakened souls; for in their
bewildered state we cannot expect from them all at once a fully
believing cry. A seeking soul should at once believe in Jesus, but it is
legitimate for a man to ask to be led to Jesus, the Holy Spirit is able
to effect such a leading, and he can do it even though the heart be on
the borders of despair.

How infinitely higher than we are is the salvation of God. We are low
and grovelling, but it towers like some tall cliff far above us. This is
its glory, and is our delight when we have once climbed into the rock,
and Claimed an interest in it; but while we are as yet trembling
seekers, the glory and sublimity of salvation appal us, and we feel that
we are too unworthy even to be partakers of it; hence we are led to cry
for grace upon grace, and to see how dependent we are for everything,
not only for the Saviour, but for the power to believe on him.

[Psa 61:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#003.md)

"For thou hast been a shelter for me." Observe how the Psalmist rings
the changes on, "Thou hast," and "I will," - [Psa
61:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#003.md), [Psa
61:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#004.md), [Psa
61:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#005.md), and [Psa
61:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#006.md). Experience is the nurse of
faith. From the past we gather arguments for present confidence. Many
and many a time had the persecutions of Saul and the perils of battle
emperilled David's life, and only by miracle had he escaped, yet was he
still alive and unhurt; this he remembers, and he is full of hope. "And
a strong tower from the enemy." As in a fort impregnable, David had
dwelt, because surrounded by omnipotence. Sweet is it beyond expression
to remember the lovingkindnesses of the Lord in our former days, for he
is unchangeable, and therefore will continue to guard us from all evil.

[Psa 61:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#004.md)

"I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever." Let me once get back to thy
courts, and nothing shall again expel me from them: even now in my
banishment my heart is there; and ever will I continue to worship thee
in spirit wherever my lot may be cast. Perhaps by the word "tabernacle"
is here meant the dwelling-place of God; and if so, the sense is, I will
dwell with the Lord, enjoying his sacred hospitality, and sure
protection.

"There would I find a settled rest,

While others go and come;

No more a stranger, or a guest,

But like a child at home."

He who communes with God is always at home. The divine omnipresence
surrounds such a one consciously; his faith sees all around him the
palace of the King, in which he walks with exulting security and
overflowing delight, Happy are the indoor servants who go not out from
his presence. Hewers of wood and drawers of water in the tents of
Jehovah are more to be envied than the princes who riot in the pavilions
of kings. The best of all is that our residence with God is not for a
limited period of time, but for ages; yea, for ages of ages, for time
and for eternity: this is our highest and most heavenly privilege, "I
will abide in thy tabernacle for."

"I will trust in the covert of thy wings." Often does our sweet singer
use this figure; and far better is it to repeat one apt and instructive
image, than for the sake of novelty to ransack creation for poor,
strained metaphors. The chicks beneath the hen how safe, how
comfortable, how happy! How warm the parent's bosom! How soft the
cherishing feathers! Divine condescension allows us to appropriate the
picture to ourselves, and how blessedly instructive and consoling it is!
O for more trust; it cannot be too implicit: such a covert invites us to
the most unbroken repose. Selah. Rest we well may when we reach this
point. Even the harp may be eloquently silent when deep, profound calm
completely fills the bosom, and sorrow has sobbed itself into a peaceful
slumber.

[Psalms 61:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 61:5</span></span>

5 For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me the heritage
of those that fear thy name.

6 Thou wilt prolong the king's life: and his years as many generations.

7 He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, which
may preserve him.

8 So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform
my vows.

[Psa 61:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#005.md)

"For thou, O God, hast heard my vows." Proofs of divine faithfulness are
to be had in remembrance, and to be mentioned to the Lord's honour. The
prayer of [Psa 61:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#001.md) is certain of an
answer because of the experience of [Psa
61:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#005.md), since we deal with an immutable
God. "Vows" may rightly be joined with prayers when they are lawful,
well-considered, and truly for God's glory. It is great mercy on God's
part to take any notice of the vows and promises of such faithless and
deceitful creatures as we are. What we promise him is his due already,
and yet he deigns to accept our vows as if we were not so much his
servants as his free suitors who could give or withhold at pleasure.
"Thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name." We are
made heirs, joint-heirs with all the saints, partakers of the same
portion. With this we ought to be delighted. If we suffer, it is the
heritage of the saints; if we are persecuted, are in poverty, or in
temptation, all this is contained in the title-deeds of the heritage of
the chosen. Those we are to sup with we may well be content to dine
with. We have the same inheritance as the First-born himself; what
better is conceivable? Saints are described as fearing the name of God;
they are reverent worshippers; they stand in awe of the Lord's
authority; they are afraid of offending him, they feel their own
nothingness in the sight of the Infinite One. To share with such men, to
be treated by God with the same favour as he metes out to them, is
matter for endless thanksgiving. All the privileges of all the saints
are also the privilege of each one.

[Psa 61:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#006.md)

"Thou will prolong the king's life;" or, better, "days to the days of
the King thou wilt add." Death threatened, but God preserved his
beloved. David, considering his many perils, enjoyed a long and
prosperous reign. "And his years as many generations." He lived to see
generation after generation personally; in his descendants he lived as
king through a very long period; his dynasty continued for many
generations; and in Christ Jesus, his seed and son, spiritually David
reigns on evermore. Thus he who began at the foot of the rock, half
drowned, and almost dead, is here led to the summit, and sings as a
priest abiding in the tabernacle, a king ruling with God for ever, and a
prophet foretelling good things to come, ([Psa
61:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#007)..md) See the uplifting power of
faith and prayer. None so low but they may yet be set on high.

[Psa 61:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#007.md)

"He shall abide before God for ever." Though this is true of David in a
modified sense, we prefer to view the Lord Jesus as here intended as the
lineal descendant of David, and the representative of his royal race.
Jesus is enthroned before God to eternity; here is our safety, dignity,
and delight. We reign in him; in him we are made to sit together in the
heavenlies. David's personal claim to sit enthroned for ever is but a
foreshadowing of the revealed privilege of all true believers. "O
prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him." As men cry, "Long live
the king," so we hail with acclamation our enthroned Immanuel, and cry,
"Let mercy and truth preserve him." Eternal love and immutable
faithfulness are the bodyguards of Jesus' throne, and they are both the
providers and the preservers of all those who in him are made kings and
priests unto God. We cannot keep ourselves, and nothing short of divine
mercy and truth can do it; but these both can and will, nor shall the
least of the people of God be suffered to perish.

[Psa 61:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#008.md)

"So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever." Because my prayer is
answered, my song shall be perpetual; because Jesus for ever sits at thy
right hand, it shall be acceptable; because I am preserved in him, it
shall be grateful. David had given vocal utterance to his prayer by a
cry; he will now give expression to his praise by a song: there should
be a parallel between our supplications and our thanksgivings. We ought
not to leap in prayer, and limp in praise. The vow to celebrate the
divine name "for ever" is no hyperbolical piece of extravagance, but
such as grace and glory shall enable us to carry out to the letter.
"That I may daily perform my vows." To God who adds days to our days we
will devote all our days. We vowed perpetual praise, and we desire to
render it without intermission. We would worship God de die in diem,
going right on as the days roll on. We ask no vacation from this
heavenly vocation; we would make no pause in this sacred service. God
daily performs his promises, let us daily perform our vows: he keeps his
covenant let us not forget ours. Blessed be the name of the Lord from
this time forth, even for evermore.
