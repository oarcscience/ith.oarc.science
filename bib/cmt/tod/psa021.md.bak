### [Psalms Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 21:0</span></span>

Subject - The title gives us but little information; it is simply, To
the chief Musician, a Psalm of David. Probably written by David, sung by
David, relating to David, and intended by David to refer in its fullest
reach of meaning to David's Lord. It is evidently the fit companion of
Psalm Twenty, and is in its proper position next to it. Psalm Twenty
anticipates what this regards as realized. If we pray today for a
benefit and receive it, we must, ere the sun goes down, praise God for
that mercy, or we deserve to be denied the next time it has been called
David's triumphant song, and we may remember it as The Royal Triumphal
Ode. "The king" is most prominent throughout, and we shall read it to
true profit if our meditation of him shall be sweet while perusing it.
We must crown him with the glory of our salvation; singing of his love,
and praising his power. The next Psalm will take us to the foot of the
cross, this introduces us to the steps of the throne.

Division - The division of the translators will answer every purpose. A
thanksgiving for victory, [Psa 21:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#001.md).
Confidence of further success, [Psa
21:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#007.md).

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Whole Psalm

The last Psalm was a litany before the king went forth to battle This is
apparently a Te Deum on his return. - J. J. Stewart Perowne, B.D., in
the "Book of Psalms: a New Translation, with Introductions and Notes,"
1864.

Whole Psalm

The prayer which the church utters up at the conclusion of the preceding
Psalm now issues in a hymn of praise, the result of a believing view of
the glory which is to follow, when Messiah's sufferings are ended. This
is one of the beautiful songs of which we find many in Scripture,
prepared by the Holy Spirit to awaken and enliven the hopes and
expectations of the church while she waits for the Lord, and to give
utterance to her joy at the time of his arrival. The theme is Messiah's
exaltation and glory, and the time chosen for its delivery is just the
moment when darkness covered the earth, and all nature seemed about to
die with its expiring Lord. Scripture deals largely in contrasts. It
seems to be suitable to the human mind to turn from one extreme to
another. Man can endure any change, however violent and contradictory,
but a long continuance, a sameness either of joy or sorrow, has a
debilitating and depressing effect. - R. H. Ryland.

Whole Psalm

"After this I looked... and behold a throne was set in heaven, and one
sat on the throne." [Rev 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#001.md), [Rev
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#002.md). Such may be considered as the
description of this Psalm, after the foregoing prayer. "He who in the
preceding Psalm," says St. Jerome, "was prayed for as having taking the
form of a servant, in this is King of kings, and Lord of lords." - Isaac
Williams.

Whole Psalm

I am persuaded that there is not one who consents to the application of
the preceding Psalm to Christ in his trouble, who will fail to recognise
in this, Christ in his triumph. There he was in the dark valley - the
valley of Achor; now he is on the mount of Zion; there he was enduring
sorrow and travail; now he remembers no more the anguish, for joy that a
spiritual seed is born into the world; there he was beset with deadly
enemies, who encompassed him on every side; but here he has entered upon
that which is written in [Psa 78:65](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#065.md),
[Psa 78:66](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#066.md), "Then the Lord awaked as
one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.
And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts' he put them to a perpetual
reproach." - Hamilton Verschoyle.

Whole Psalm

As you have already observed in the heading or this Psalm, it is said to
have been composed by David. He wrote of himself in the third person,
and as "the king." He penned the Psalm, not so much for his own use, as
for his people's. It is, in fact, a national anthem, celebrating the
majesty and glory of David, but ascribing both to God - expressing
confidence in David's future, but building that confidence upon God
alone. - Samuel Martin, in "Westminster Chapel Pulpit." 1860.

[Psa 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#001.md)

"Thy strength... thy salvation." So you have two words, "virtus and
salus," strength and salvation. Note them well; for not virtus without
salus, nor salus without virtus, neither without the other is full, nor
both without Tua Domine. In virtute is well, so it have in salute after
it. For not in strength alone is there matter of joy, every way
considered. No, not in God's strength, if it have not salvation behind
it. Strength, not to smite us down, but strength to deliver; this is the
joyful side. Now turn it the other way. As strength, if it end in
salvation, is just cause for joy, so salvation, if it go with strength,
makes joy yet more joyful; for it becomes a strong salvation, a mighty
deliverance. - Launcelot Andrews (Bishop), 1555-1626, in "Conspiracie of
the Gowries."

[Psa 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#001.md)

"In thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice." Oh, it is good
rejoicing in the strength of that arm which shall never wither, and in
the shadow of those wings which shall never cast their feathers! in him
that is not there yesterday and here today, but the same yesterday,
today, and for ever! For as he is, so shall the joy be. - Lancelot
Andrews.

[Psa 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#002.md)

"Thou hast given him the desire of his soul." He desired to eat the
passover, and to lay down his life when he would and again when he would
to take it; and thou hast given it to him. "And hast not deprived him of
the good pleasure of his lips." "My peace," saith he, "I leave with
you;" and it was done. - Augustine, in loc.

[Psa 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#002) (first clause.md)

Good men are sure to have out their prayers either in money, or in
money's worth, as they say - in that very thing, or a better. - John
Trapp.

[Psa 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#002.md)

"Selah." See notes on 3:2;, 3:2, 4, 8; 4:2, 20:3.

[Psa 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#003.md)

"For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a
crown of pure gold on his head." The Son of God could not be more ready
to ask for the blessings of the divine goodness, than the Father was to
give them; and his disposition is the same towards all his adopted sons.
Christ, as King and Priest, weareth a crown of glory, represented by the
purest and most resplendent of metals - gold. He is pleased to esteem
his saints, excelling in different virtues, as the rubies, the
sapphires, and the emeralds, which grace and adorn that crown. Who would
not be ambitious of obtaining a place therein? - George Horne.

[Psa 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#003.md)

"Thou hast prevented him with the blessings of goodness." As if he
should say, "Lord, I never asked a kingdom, I never thought of a
kingdom, but thou hast prevented me with the blessings of thy goodness."
... From whence I take up this note or doctrine, that it is a sweet
thing and worthy of all our thankful acknowledgments, to be prevented
with the blessings of God's goodness, or God's good blessings.... It is
no new thing for God to walk in a way of preventing love and mercy with
the children of men. Thus he hath always dealt, doth deal, and will
deal; thus he hath always dealt with the world, with the nations of the
world, with great towns and places, with families, and with particular
souls.... As for particular souls, you know how it was with Matthew the
publican, sitting at the receipt of custom. "Come and follow me," says
Christ; preventing of him. And you know how it was with Paul: "I was a
blasphemer, and I was a persecutor, but I obtained mercy." How so? Did
he seek it first? "No," says he, "I went breathing out threatenings
against the people of God, and God met me, and unhorsed me; God
prevented me with his grace and mercy." Thus Paul. And pray tell me what
do you think of that whole chapter of Luke - the fifteenth? There are
three parables: the parable of the lost groat, of the lost sheep, and of
the lost son. The woman lost her groat, and swept to find it, but did
the groat make first towards the woman, or the woman make after the
groat first? The shepherd lost his sheep, but did the sheep make first
after the shepherd, or the shepherd after the sheep? Indeed, it is said
concerning the lost son, that he first takes up a resolution, "I will
return home to my father," but when his father saw him afar off, he ran
and met him, and embraced him, and welcomed him home. Why? But to show
that the work of grace and mercy shall be all along carried on in a way
of preventing love. - Condensed from William Bridge, 1600-1670.

[Psa 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#003.md)

"For thou hast prevented him with the blessings of sweetness." Because
he had first quaffed the blessing of thy sweetness, the gall of our sins
did not hurt him - Augustine.

[Psa 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#003.md)

"Thou preventest him." The word "prevent" is now generally used to
represent the idea of hindrance. "Thou preventest him," would mean
commonly, "Thou hinderest him." But here the word "prevent" means to go
before. Thou goest before him with the blessings of thy goodness as a
pioneer, to make crooked ways straight, and rough places smooth; or, as
one who strews flowers in the path of another, to render the way
beautiful to the eye and pleasant to the tread. - Samuel Martin.

[Psa 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#003) (first clause.md)

The text is an acknowledgment of God's goodness. God had anticipated
David's wants; and he writes. "Thou preventest - thou goest before him -
with goodness." The words "blessings of goodness" suggest that God's
gifts are God's love embodied and expressed. And this greatly enhances
the value of our blessings - that they are cups as full of God and of
God's kindness as of happiness and blessedness. - Samuel Martin.

[Psa 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#003) (first clause .md)

A large portion of our blessing is given us before our asking or
seeking. Existence, reason, intellect, a birth in a Christian land, the
calling of our nation to the knowledge of Christ, and Christ himself,
with many other things, are unsought bestowed on men, as was David's
right to the throne on him. No one ever asked for a Saviour till God of
his own motion promised "the seed of the woman." - William S. Plumer.

[Psa 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#003.md)

"Thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head." Christ may be said to
have a fourfold glory, or crown. 1. As God co-essential with the Father;
"the brightness of the Father's glory, and the express image of his
person." [Heb 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002.md), [Heb
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md). 2. He hath a crown and glory as
Mediator, in respect of the power, authority, and glory wherewith he is
invested as God's great deputy, and anointed upon the hill of Zion,
having power, and a rod of iron, even in reference to enemies. 3. He
hath a crown and glory in respect of the manifestation of his glory in
the executing of his offices, when he makes his mediatory power and
glory apparent in particular steps' thus sometimes he is said to take
his power to him ([Rev 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#017).md); and is
said to be crowned when the white horse of the gospel rides in triumph.
[Rev 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#002.md). The last step of this glory
will be in the day of judgment; in short, this consists in his
exercising his former power committed to him as Mediator. 4. There is a
crown and glory which is in a manner put on him by particular believers,
When he is glorified by them, not by adding anything to his infinite
glory, but by their acknowledging of him to be so. - James Durham,
1622-1658.

[Psa 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#003.md)

The "crown of pure gold" has respect to his exaltation at the right hand
of God, where he is crowned with glory and honour, and this "crown"
being of "pure gold," denotes the purity, glory, solidity, and
perpetuity of his kingdom. - John Gill.

[Psa 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#004.md)

"He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for
ever and ever." The glory of God is concerned in Christ's living for
ever. 1. The glory of his faithfulness: for eternal life and blessedness
were pledged to Immanuel in covenant as the reward of his work ([Psa
110:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md); [Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md), [Isa
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007), etc..md); and it was in the
anticipation and confident hope of this, that he "endured the cross,
despising the shame." [Heb 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002.md); [Psa
16:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#008.md). 2. The glory of his justice.
The justice of God was honoured and fully satisfied in all its righteous
demands by the death of Christ. His subsequent life is the expression on
the part of God of that satisfaction. His perpetual life is a permanent
declaration that in him and his finished work the everlasting
righteousness of Jehovah rests for ever satisfied. Death can "never more
have dominion over him;" for to inflict the penalty again would be a
violation of justice. 3. The glory of his grace. The glory of this grace
he now lives actively to promote. [Joh
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#002.md). By living "ever" at God's right
hand, he appears as an eternal memorial of God's love in making him our
Mediator and Substitute - our Saviour from sin and wrath; and his
permanent appearance there will keep all heaven perpetually in mind that
"by the grace of God they are what they are," owing all to the sovereign
mercy of God through Jesus Christ. He shall appear as the blessed medium
through which all the gifts and joys of salvation shall flow to the
guilty for evermore. Thus the power of God and all his moral attributes
secure the perpetuity of the life of the risen and exalted Saviour. -
Ralph Wardlaw, D.D.

[Psa 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#004.md)

"He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him." He asked a resurrection
saying "Father, glorify thy Son;" and thou gavest it him, "Length of
days for ever and ever." The prolonged ages of this world which the
church was to have, and after them an eternity, world without end. -
Augustine

[Psa 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#004.md)

"He asked life of thee," etc. Thus God is better to his people than
their prayers; and when they ask but one blessing, he answereth them as
Naaman did Gehazi, with Nay, take two. Hezekiah asked but one life, and
God gave him fifteen years, which we reckon at two lives and more. He
giveth liberally and like himself; as great Alexander did when he gave
the poor beggar a city; and when he sent his schoolmaster a ship full of
frankincense, and bade him sacrifice freely. - John Trapp.

[Psa 21:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#004.md)

If David had before been without the symbol of his royal dignity,
namely, the diadem, he was the more justified in praising the goodness
of God, which had now transferred it from the head of an enemy to his
own. - Augustus F. Tholuck.

[Psa 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#005.md)

"His glory is great in thy salvation." - I remember one dying and
hearing some discourses of Jesus Christ; "Oh," said she, "speak more of
this - let me hear more of this - be not weary of telling his praise; I
long to see him, how should I but long to hear of him?" Surely I cannot
say too much of Jesus Christ. On this blessed subject no man can
possibly hyperbolise. Had I the tongues of men and angels, I could never
fully set forth Christ. It involves an eternal contradiction, that the
creature can see to the bottom of the Creator. Suppose all the sands on
the sea-shore, all the flowers, herbs, leaves, twigs of trees in woods
and forests, all the stars of heaven, were all rational creatures; and
had they that wisdom, and tongues of angels to speak of the loveliness,
beauty, glory, and excellency of Christ, as gone to heaven, and sitting
at the right hand of his Father, they would, in all their expressions,
stay millions of miles on this side Jesus Christ. Oh, the loveliness,
beauty, and glory of his countenance! Can I speak, or you hear of such a
Christ? And are we not all in a burning love, in a seraphical love, or
at least in a conjugal love? O my heart, how is it thou art not love
sick? How is it thou dost not charge the daughters of Jerusalem as the
spouse did: "I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem if ye find my
beloved, that ye shall tell him, that I am sick of love." [Sol
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#008.md). - Isaac Ambrose.

[Psa 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#005.md)

"Honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him." If it be demanded whether
Christ were exalted unto his glory and dignity, according to both his
natures, both his Godhead and his manhood, I answer, according to both.
According to his Godhead, not as it is considered in itself, but
inasmuch as his Godhead, which from his birth unto his death did little
show itself, after his resurrection was made manifest in his manhood;
for, as the apostle saith ([Rom 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004).md),
"He was declared mightily to be the Son of God by the resurrection from
the dead," even by the resurrection, and after his resurrection from the
dead, he which was thought only to be man, was most plainly manifested
likewise to be God. Now, as touching his manhood, he was therein exalted
unto highest majesty in the heavenly places, not only shaking off all
infirmities of man's nature, but also being beautified and adorned with
all qualities of glory, both in his soul and in his body, yet so that he
still retaineth the properties of a true body, for even as he was man,
he was set at the right hand of the Father, to rule and reign over all,
till all his enemies be destroyed, and put under his feet. To knit up
all in a word, Christ, God, and man, after his resurrection, was crowned
with glory and honour, even such as plainly showed him to be God, and
was set on the throne of God, there to rule and reign as sovereign Lord
and King, till he come in the clouds to judge both quick and dead. Here,
then, is both matter of comfort and consolation unto the godly, and
likewise of fear and astonishment unto the wicked and ungodly. - Henry
Airay, 1560-1616.

[Psa 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#005) (last clause.md)

Christ was "a man of sorrows" on earth, but he is full of joy in heaven.
He that "wipes away all tears from the eyes of his people," surely has
none of his own. There was a joy set before him before he suffered, and
doubtless it was given him when he sat down at God's right hand. We may
take the latter to be an actual donation of the former; the joy he had
in prospect when he suffered he had in possession when he came to his
throne. This is the time of his receiving the Father's public
approbation, and the tokens of his love, before the whole heavenly
assembly, which must be matter of great joy to him who so much valued
and delighted in his Father's love. - John Hurrion, 1675-1731.

[Psa 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#005.md)

Happy he who hath a bone, or an arm, to put the crown upon the head of
our highest King, whose chariot is paved with love. Were there ten
thousand millions of heavens created above these highest heavens, and
again as many above them, and as many above them, till angels were
wearied with counting, it were but too low a seat to fix the princely
throne of that Lord Jesus (whose ye are) above them all. - Samuel
Rutherford.

[Psa 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#006.md)

"Thou hast made him exceeding glad:" literally, "brightened him,"
possibly in allusion to the brightness of Moses' face. - Dalman
Hapstone, M.A., in "The Ancient Psalms.... A Literal Translation and
Notes," etc, 1867.

[Psa 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#006.md)

"Thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance." Though this be
metaphorically used for favour, yet is the speech not all metaphor, and
that well-experienced Christians will tell you. - Zachary Bogan, in "The
Mirth of a Christian Life," 1653.

[Psa 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#006) (first clause.md)

Literally, as in the Bible marginal translation, "Thou hast set him to
be blessings for ever." Most truly said of the King in whom all the
nations of the earth were to be blessed. - Richard Mant.

[Psa 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#008.md)

"Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find
out those that hate thee." By a kind of climax in the form of
expression, "hand," is followed by "right hand," a still more emphatic
sign of active strength. To "find," in this connection, includes the
ideas of detecting and reaching. Compare [Sa1
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#017.md); [Isa
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#010.md); in the latter of which places
the verb is construed with a preposition (ל), as it is in the first
clause of the verse before us, whereas in the other clause it governs
the noun directly. If any difference of meaning was intended, it is
probably not greater than that between find and find out in English. -
Joseph Addison Alexander.

[Psa 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#008.md)

"Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find
out those that hate thee." Saul killed himself, for fear of falling into
the hands of his enemies, and thought death less terrible than the shame
that he would have endured in seeing himself in their power. What will
it be then "to fall into the hands of the living God" ([Heb
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#031).md), of an offended God? of God
unchangeably determined to be avenged? "Who can stand before his
indignation?" says the prophet Nahum. Who will dare look on him? Who
will dare show himself? "Who may abide the day of his coming" ([Mal
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#002).md) without shuddering and fainting
for fear,? If Joseph's brethren were so terrified that they "could not
answer him," when he said, "I am Joseph your brother," how will it be
with sinners, when they shall hear the voice of the Son of God, when he
shall triumph over them in his wrath, and say unto them, "I am he" whom
ye despised; "I am he" whom ye have offended; "I am he" whom ye have
crucified? If these words, "I am he," overthrew the soldiers in the
garden of Olives ([Joh 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#006).md), though
spoken with extreme gentleness, how will it be when his indignation
bursts forth, when it falls upon his enemies like a thunderbolt, and
reduces them into dust? Then will they cry out in terror and say to the
mountains, "Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on
the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb." [Rev
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#016.md). - James Nouet.

[Psa 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#008.md)

"Thine hand shall find out," etc. It is not meant only of a discovery of
a person (though it be a truth, that the Lord will discover all that are
his enemies), but thine hand shall find them out, is, it shall take hold
of them, grasp them, and arrest them. "Thine hand shall find out" all
"thine enemies," though close, though covert enemies; not only thy
above-ground enemies, but thy under-ground enemies; as well those that
undermine thee, as those that assault thee. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#009.md)

"Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the
Lord shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour
them." How then shall it fare with sinners, when, after all, shall come
that general fire so often foretold, which shall either fall from
heaven, or ascend out of hell, or (according to Albertus Magnus),
proceed from both, and shall devour and consume all it meets with?
Whither shall the miserable fly, when that river of flames, or (to say
better), that inundation and deluge of fire shall so encompass them, as
no place of surety shall be left; where nothing can avail but a holy
life; when all besides shall perish, in that universal ruin of the whole
world? What lamentations were in Rome, when it burnt for seven days
together! What shrieks were heard in Troy, when it was wholly consumed
with flames! What howling and astonishment in Pentapolis, when those
cities were destroyed with fire from heaven! What weeping was there in
Jerusalem, when they beheld the house of God, the glory of their
kingdom, the wonder of the world, involved in fire and smoke! Imagine
what these people felt; they saw their houses and goods on fire, and no
possibility of saving them: when the husband heard the shrieks and cries
of his dying wife; the father, of his little children; and, unawares,
perceived himself so encompassed with flames, that he could neither
relieve them, nor free himself. What shall it then profit the
worldlings, to have rich vessels of gold and silver, curious
embroideries, precious tapestries, pleasant gardens, sumptuous palaces,
and all what the world now esteems, when they shall with their own eyes,
behold their costly palaces burnt, their rich and curious pieces of gold
melted, and their flourishing and pleasant orchards consumed, without
power to preserve them or themselves? All shall burn, and with it the
world, and all the memory and fame of it shall die; and that which
mortals thought to be immortal, shall then end and perish. - Jeremy
Taylor.

"Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger." They
shall not only be cast into a furnace of fire ([Mat
13:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#042).md), but he shall make them
themselves as a fiery oven or furnace, they shall be their own
tormentors, the reflections and terrors of their own consciences will be
their hell. Those that might have had Christ to rule and save them, but
rejected him, and fought against him, even the remembrance of that will
be enough to make them to eternity a fiery oven to themselves. - Matthew
Henry.

[Psa 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#009.md)

"Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven:" thou shalt make them on fire
within, by the consciousness of their ungodliness: "In the time of thy
countenance;" in the time of thy manifestation. - Augustine.

[Psa 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#009.md)

"As a fiery oven," where the burning is extremely hot, the heat striking
upon what is in it from all sides, above, below, and about, on all
hands, and the door closed from going out, or from suffering any cool
refreshment to come in. - David Dickson.

[Psa 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#009.md)

"As a fiery oven." Shall make them like a vault of fire, literally, "an
oven," as in our translation, or "furnace of fire." Bishop Horsley
remarks, "It describes the smoke of the Messiah's enemies perishing by
fire, ascending like the smoke of a furnace. 'The smoke of their
torments shall ascend for ever and ever.'" How awfully grand is that
description of the ruins of the cities of the plain, as the prospect
struck on Abraham's eye on the fatal morning of their destruction! "And
he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the
plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the
smoke of a furnace." Milton puts it -

"Overhead the dismal hiss

Of fiery darts in flaming volleys flew,

And flying vaulted either host with fire."

Richard Mant.

[Psa 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#009.md)

The Chaldee reads: - "The fire of Gehenna, or hell." - John Morison.

[Psa 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#009.md)

"The time of thine anger." If God be willing to pour out his heavy
displeasure upon those that displease him, what can hinder his mighty
arm from performing? Creatures indeed may be angry, but oftentimes, like
drones without stings, cannot hurt; as cannons charged with powder
without shot only make a roaring; like the Pope's Bulls, threaten many,
hurt none but those whose consciences are enslaved. Saul may be angry at
David, but cannot find him out; but from God's all-piercing eye none can
hide himself. Satan may desire to kill Job, Jonah may be angry till
death for Nineveh's preservation; yet God puts a bit in both their
mouths, who, if he be angry, nothing can be holden out of his reach.
Princes, if they take captives, may have them rescued from them again,
as Lot was from the King of Sodom; bought with a price, as Joseph of the
Ishmaelites. But no power can rescue us from God's anger, no ransom but
Christ's blood redeem us. God's will being set afoot, all his attributes
follow; if his will say, Be angry, his eye seeks out the object of his
anger, and finds it; his wisdom tempers the cup, his hand whets the
sword, his arm strikes the blow. Thus you see there is a time of God's
anger for sin, because he will have it so. - John Cragge.

[Psa 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#009.md)

"The fire shall devour them." Being troubled by the vengeance of the
Lord, after the accusation of their conscience, they shall be given up
to eternal fire to be devoured. - Augustine.

[Psa 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#009.md)

I have read that a frown of Queen Elizabeth killed Sir Christopher
Hatton, the Lord Chancellor of England. What then shall the frowns of
the King of nations do? If the rocks rend, the mountains melt, and the
foundations of the earth tremble under his wrath; bow will the ungodly
sinner appear when he comes in all his royal glory to take vengeance on
all that knew him not, and that obeyed not his glorious gospel. -
Charles Bradbury.

[Psa 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#010.md)

"Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from
among the children of men." A day is coming when all the "fruits" of
sin, brought forth by sinners in their words, their writings, and their
actions shall be "destroyed;" yea, the tree itself, which had produced
them, shall be rooted up, and cast into the fire. The "seed" and
posterity of the wicked, if they continue in the way of their
forefathers, will be punished like them. Let parents consider, that upon
their principles and practices may depend the salvation or destruction
of multitudes after them. The case of the Jews, daily before their eyes,
should make them tremble. - George Horne.

[Psa 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#011.md)

"They intended," or warped. Hebrew, hvaebent or stretched. A similitude
taken from weavers, who warp their yarn before they weave: or from
archers, who, when they have bent their bow and put in their arrow, do
take their aim. - John Diodati.

[Psa 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#012.md)

"Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back," or, thou shalt set
them as a butt, "when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy
strings against the face of them." The judgments of God are called his
"arrows," being sharp, swift, sure, and deadly. What a dreadful
situation, to be set as a mark and "butt" at which these arrows are
directed! View Jerusalem encompassed by the Roman armies without, and
torn to pieces by the animosity of desperate and bloody factions within!
No farther commentary is requisite upon this verse. - George Horne.

[Psalms 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 21:1</span></span>

1 The king shall joy in thy strength, O Lord; and in thy salvation how
greatly shall he rejoice!

2 Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withholden the
request of his lips. Selah.

3 For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a
crown of pure gold on his head.

4 He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for
ever and ever.

5 His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid
upon him.

6 For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him
exceeding glad with thy countenance.

[Psa 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#001.md)

"The king shall joy in thy strength, O Lord." Jesus is a Royal
Personage. The question, "Art thou a King then?" received a full answer
from the Saviour's lips: "Thou sayest that I am a King. To this end was
I born, and for this purpose came I into this world, that I might bear
witness unto the truth." He is not merely a King, but the King; King
over minds and hearts, reigning with a dominion of love, before which
all other rule is but mere brute force. He was proclaimed King even on
the cross, for there, indeed, to the eye of faith, he reigned as on a
throne, blessing with more than imperial munificence the needy sons of
earth. Jesus has wrought out the salvation of his people, but as a man
he found his strength in Jehovah his God, to whom he addressed himself
in prayer upon the lonely mountain's side, and in the garden's solitary
gloom. That strength so abundantly given is here gratefully
acknowledged, and made the subject of joy. The Man of Sorrows is now
anointed with the oil of gladness above his fellows. Returned in triumph
from the overthrow of all his foes, he offers his own rapturous Te Deum
in the temple above, and joys in the power of the Lord. Herein let every
subject of King Jesus imitate the King; let us lean upon Jehovah's
strength, let us joy in it by unstaggering faith, let us exult in it in
our thankful songs. Jesus not only has thus rejoiced, but he shall do so
as he sees the power of divine grace bringing out from their sinful
hiding-places the purchase of his soul's travail; we also shall rejoice
more and more as we learn by experience more and more fully the strength
of the arm of our covenant God our weakness unstrings our harps, but his
strength tunes them anew. If we cannot sing a note in honour of our own
strength, we can at any rate rejoice in our omnipotent God.

"And in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!" everything is
ascribed to God; the source is thy strength and the stream is thy
salvation. Jehovah planned and ordained it, works it and crowns it, and
therefore it is his salvation. The joy here spoken of is described by a
note of exclamation and a word of wonder: "how greatly!" The rejoicing
of our risen Lord must, like his agony, be unutterable. If the mountains
of his joy rise in proportion to the depth of the valleys of his grief,
then his sacred bliss is high as the seventh heaven. For the joy which
was set before him he endured the cross, despising the shame, and now
that joy daily grows, for he rests in his love and rejoices over his
redeemed with singing, as in due order they are brought to find their
salvation in his blood. Let us with our Lord rejoice in salvation, as
coming from God, as coming to us, as extending itself to others, and as
soon to encompass all lands. We need not be afraid of too much rejoicing
in this respect; this solid foundation will well sustain the loftiest
edifice of joy. The shoutings of the early Methodists in the excitement
of the joy were far more pardonable than our own lukewarmness. Our joy
should have some sort of inexpressibleness in it.

[Psa 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#002.md)

"Thou hast given him his heart's desire." That desire he ardently
pursued when he was on earth, both by his prayer, his actions, and his
suffering; he manifested that his heart longed to redeem his people, and
now in heaven he has his desire granted him, for he sees his beloved
coming to be with him where he is. The desires of the Lord Jesus were
from his heart, and the Lord heard them; if our hearts are right with
God, he will in our case also "fulfil the desire of them that fear him."

"And hast not withholden the request of his lips." What is in the well
of the heart is sure to come up in the bucket of the lips, and those are
the only true prayers where the heart's desire is first, and the lip's
request follows after. Jesus prayed vocally as well as mentally; speech
is a great assistance to thought. Some of us feel that even when alone
we find it easier to collect our thoughts when we can pray aloud. The
requests of the Saviour were not withheld. He was and still is a
prevailing Pleader. Our Advocate on high returns not empty from the
throne of grace. He asked for his elect in the eternal council-chamber,
he asked for blessings for them here, he asked for glory for them
hereafter, and his requests have speeded. He is ready to ask for us at
the mercy-seat. Have we not at this hour some desire to send up to his
Father by him? Let us not be slack to use our willing, loving,
all-prevailing Intercessor.

"Selah." Here a pause is very properly inserted, that we may admire the
blessed success of the king's prayers, and that we may prepare our own
requests which may be presented through him. If we had a few more quiet
rests, a few more Selahs in our public worship, it might be profitable.

[Psa 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#003.md)

"For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness." The word
prevent formerly signified to precede or go before, and assuredly
Jehovah preceded his Son with blessings. Before he died saints were
saved by the anticipated merit of his death, before he came believers
saw his day and were glad, and he himself had his delights with the sons
of men. The Father is so willing to give blessings through his Son, that
instead of his being constrained to bestow his grace, he outstrips the
Mediatorial march of mercy. "I say not that I will pray the Father for
you, for the Father himself loveth you." Before Jesus calls the Father
answers, and while he is yet speaking he hears. Mercies may be bought
with blood, but they are also freely given. The love of Jehovah is not
caused by the Redeemer's sacrifice, but that love, with its blessings of
goodness, preceded the great atonement, and provided it for our
salvation. Reader, it will be a happy thing for thee if, like thy Lord,
thou canst see both providence and grace preceding thee, forestalling
thy needs, and preparing thy path. Mercy, in the case of many of us, ran
before our desires and prayers, and it ever outruns our endeavours and
expectancies, and even our hopes are left to lag behind. Prevenient
grace deserves a song; we may make one out of this sentence, let us try.
All our mercies are to be viewed as "blessings;" gifts of a blessed God,
meant to make us blessed; they are "blessings of goodness," not of
merit, but of free favour; and they come to us in a preventing way, a
way of prudent foresight, such as only preventing love could have
arranged. In this light the verse is itself a sonnet!

"Thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head." Jesus wore the
thorn-crown, but now wears the glory-crown, It is a "crown," indicating
royal nature, imperial power, deserved honour, glorious conquest, and
divine government. The crown is of the richest, rarest, most
resplendent, and most lasting order - "gold," and that gold of the most
refined and valuable sort, "pure gold," to indicate the excellence of
his dominion. This crown is set upon his head most firmly, and whereas
other monarchs find their diadems fitting loosely, his is fixed so that
no power can move it, for Jehovah himself has set it upon his brow.
Napoleon crowned himself, but Jehovah crowned the Lord Jesus; the empire
of the one melted in an hour, but the other has an abiding dominion.
Some versions read, "a crown of precious stones;" this may remind us of
those beloved ones who shall be as jewels in his crown, of whom he has
said, "They shall be mine in the day when I make up my jewels." May we
be set in the golden circlet of the Redeemer's glory, and adorn his head
for ever!

[Psa 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#004.md)

"He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for
ever and ever." The first words may suit King David, but the length of
days for ever and ever can only refer to the King Messiah. Jesus, as
man, prayed for resurrection and he received it, and now possesses it in
immortality. He died once, but being raised from the dead he dieth no
more. "Because I live, ye shall live also," is the delightful intimation
which the Saviour gives us, that we are partakers of his eternal life.
We had never found this jewel, if he had not rolled away the stone which
covered it.

[Psa 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#005.md)

"His glory is great in thy salvation." Immanuel bears the palm; he once
bore the cross. The Father has glorified his Son, so that there is no
glory like unto that which surroundeth him. See his person as it is
described by John in the Revelation; see his dominion as it stretches
from sea to sea; see his splendour as he is revealed in flaming fire.
Lord, who is like unto thee? Solomon in all his glory could not be
compared with thee, thou once despised Man of Nazareth! Mark, reader:
salvation is ascribed to God; and thus the Son, as our Saviour,
magnifies his Father; but the Son's glory is also greatly seen, for the
Father glorifies his Son.

"Honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him." Parkhurst reads,
"splendour and beauty." These are put upon Jesus, as chains of gold, and
stars and tokens of honour are placed upon princes and great men. As the
wood of the tabernacle was overlaid with pure gold, so is Jesus covered
with glory and honour. If there be a far more exceeding and eternal
weight of glory for his humble followers, what must there be for our
Lord himself? The whole weight of sin was laid upon him; it is but meet
that the full measure of the glory of bearing it away should be laid
upon the same beloved person. A glory commensurate with his shame he
must and will receive, for well has he earned it. It is not possible for
us to honour Jesus too much; what our God delights to do, we may
certainly do to our utmost. Oh for new crowns for the lofty brow which
once was marred with thorns!

"Let him be crowned with majesty

Who bowed his head to death.

And be his honours sounded high

By all thing that have breath."

[Psa 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#006.md)

"For thou hast made him most blessed for ever." He is most blessed in
himself, for he is God over all, blessed for ever; but this relates to
him as our Mediator, in which capacity blessedness is given to him as a
reward. The margin has it, thou hast set him to be blessings; he is an
overflowing wellspring of blessings to others, a sun filling the
universe with light. According as the Lord sware unto Abraham, the
promised seed is an everlasting source of blessings to all the nations
of the earth. He is set for this, ordained appointed, made incarnate
with this very design, that he may bless the sons of men. Oh that
sinners had sense enough to use the Saviour for that end to which he is
ordained, viz., to be a Saviour to lost and guilty souls.

"Thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance." He who is a
blessing to others cannot but be glad himself; the unbounded good-doing
of Jesus ensures him unlimited joy. The loving favour of his Father, the
countenance of God, gives Jesus exceeding joy. This is the purest stream
to drink of, and Jesus chooses no other. His joy is full. Its source is
divine. Its continuance eternal. Its degree exceeding all bounds. The
countenance of God makes the Prince of Heaven glad; how ought we to seek
it, and how careful should we be lest we should provoke him by our sins
to hide his face from us! Our anticipations may cheerfully fly forward
to the hour when the joy of our Lord shall be shed abroad on all the
saints, and the countenance of Jehovah shall shine upon all the
blood-bought. So shall we "enter into the joy of our Lord."

So far all has been "the shout of them that triumph, the song of them
that feast." Let us shout and sing with them, for Jesus is our King, and
in his triumphs we share a part.

[Psalms 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 21:7</span></span>

7 For the king trusteth in the Lord, and through the mercy of the most
High he shall not be moved.

8 Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find
out those that hate thee.

9 Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the
Lord shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.

10 Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from
among the children of men.

11 For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous
device, which they are not able to perform.

12 Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt make
ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them.

13 Be thou exalted, Lord, in thine own strength: so will we sing and
praise thy power.

[Psa 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#007.md)

"For the king trusteth in the Lord." Our Lord, like a true King and
leader, was a master in the use of the weapons, and could handle well
the shield of faith, for he has set us a brilliant example of unwavering
confidence in God. He felt himself safe in his Father's care until his
hour was come, he knew that he was always heard in heaven; he committed
his cause to him that judgeth right, and in his last moments he
committed his spirit into the same hands. The joy expressed in the
former verses was the joy of faith, and the victory achieved was due to
the same precious grace. A holy confidence in Jehovah is the true mother
of victories. This Psalm of triumph was composed long before our Lord's
conflict began, but faith overleaps the boundaries of time, and chants
her "Io triumphe," while yet she sings her battle song.

"Through the mercy of the Most High he shall not be moved." Eternal
mercy secures the mediatorial throne of Jesus. He who is Most High in
every sense, engages all his infinite perfections to maintain the throne
of grace upon which our King in Zion reigns. He was not moved from his
purpose, nor in his sufferings, nor by his enemies, nor shall he be
moved from the completion of his designs. He is the same yesterday,
today, and for ever. Other empires are dissolved by the lapse of years,
but eternal mercy maintains his growing dominion evermore; other kings
fail because they rest upon an arm of flesh, but our monarch reigns on
in splendour because he trusteth in Jehovah. It is a great display of
divine mercy to men that the throne of King Jesus is still among them:
nothing but divine mercy could sustain it, for human malice would
overturn it tomorrow if it could. We ought to trust in God for the
promotion of the Redeemer's kingdom, for in Jehovah the King himself
trusts: all unbelieving methods of action, and especially all reliance
upon mere human ability, should be for ever discarded from a kingdom
where the monarch sets the example of walking by faith in God.

[Psa 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#008.md)

"Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find
out those that hate thee." The destruction of the wicked is a fitting
subject for joy to the friends of righteousness; hence here, and in most
scriptural Songs, it is noted with calm thanksgiving. "Thou hast put
down the mighty from their seats," is a note of the same song which
sings, "and hast exalted them of low degree." We pity the lost for they
are men, but we cannot pity them as enemies of Christ. None can escape
from the wrath of the victorious King, nor is it desirable that they
should. Without looking for his flying foes he will find them with his
hand, for his presence is about and around them. In vain shall any hope
for escape, he will find out all, and be able to punish all, and that
too with the ease and rapidity which belong to the warrior's right hand.
The finding out relates, we think, not only to the discovery of the
hiding-places of the haters of God, but to the touching of them in their
tenderest parts, so as to cause the severest suffering. When he appears
to judge the world hard hearts will be subdued into terror, and proud
spirits humbled into shame. He who has the key of human nature can touch
all its springs at his will, and find out the means of bringing the
utmost confusion and terror upon those who aforetime boastfully
expressed their hatred of him.

[Psa 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#009.md)

"Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger." They
themselves shall be an oven to themselves and so their own tormentors.
Those who burned with anger against thee shall be burned by thine anger.
The fire of sin will be followed by the fire of wrath. Even as the smoke
of Sodom and Gomorrah went up to heaven, so shall the enemies of the
Lord Jesus be utterly and terribly consumed. Some read it, "thou shalt
put them as it were into a furnace of fire." Like faggots cast into an
oven they shall burn furiously beneath the anger of the Lord; "they
shall be cast into a furnace of fire, there shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth." These are terrible words, and those teachers do not
well who endeavour by their sophistical reasonings to weaken their
force. Reader, never tolerate slight thoughts of hell, or you will soon
have low thoughts of sin. The hell of sinners must be fearful beyond all
conception, or such language as the present would not be used. Who would
have the Son of God to be his enemy when such an overthrow awaits his
foes? The expression, "the time of thine anger," reminds us that as now
is the time of his grace, so there will be a set time for his wrath. The
judge goes upon assize at an appointed time. There is a day of vengeance
of our God; let those who despise the day of grace remember this day of
wrath.

"The Lord shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour
them." Jehovah will himself visit with his anger the enemies of his Son.
The Lord Jesus will, as it were, judge by commission from God, whose
solemn assent and co-operation shall be with him in his sentences upon
impenitent sinners. An utter destruction of soul and body, so that both
shall be swallowed up with misery, and be devoured with anguish, is here
intended. Oh, the wrath to come! The wrath to come! Who can endure it?
Lord, save us from it, for Jesus' sake.

[Psa 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#010.md)

"Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth." Their life's work shall
be a failure, and the result of their toil shall be disappointment. That
in which they prided themselves shall be forgotten; their very names
shall be wiped out as abominable, "and their seed from among the
children of men." Their posterity following in their footsteps shall
meet with a similar overthrow, till at last the race shall come to an
end. Doubtless the blessing of God is often handed down by the righteous
to their sons, as almost a heirloom in the family, while the dying
sinner bequeaths a curse to his descendants. If men will hate the Son of
God, they must not wonder if their own sons meet with no favour.

[Psa 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#011.md)

"For they intended evil against thee." God takes notice of intentions.
He who would, but could not, is as guilty as he who did. Christ's church
and cause are not only attacked by those who do not understand it, but
there are many who have the light and yet hate it. Intentional evil has
a virus in it which is not found in sins of ignorance; now as ungodly
men with malice aforethought attack the gospel of Christ, their crime is
great, and their punishment will be proportionate. The words "against
thee" show us that he who intends evil against the poorest believer
means ill to the King himself: let persecutors beware.

"They imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to
perform." Want of power is the clog on the foot of the haters of the
Lord Jesus. They have the wickedness to imagine, and the cunning to
devise, and the malice to plot mischief, but blessed be God, they fail
in ability; yet they shall be judged as to their hearts, and the will
shall be taken for the deed in the great day of account. When we read
the boastful threatenings of the enemies of the gospel at the present
day, we may close our reading by cheerfully repeating, "which they are
not able to perform." The serpent may hiss, but his head is broken; the
lion may worry, but he cannot devour; the tempest may thunder, but
cannot strike. Old Giant Pope bites his nails at the pilgrims, but he
cannot pick their bones as aforetime. Growling forth a hideous "non
possumus," the devil and all his allies retire in dismay from the walls
of Zion, for the Lord is there.

[Psa 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#012.md)

"Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt make
ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them." For a
time the foes of God may make bold advances, and threaten to overthrow
everything, but a few ticks of the clock will alter the face of their
affairs. At first they advance impudently enough, but Jehovah meets them
to their teeth, and a taste of the sharp judgments of God speedily makes
them flee in dismay. The original has in it the thought of the wicked
being set as a butt for God to shoot at, a target for his wrath to aim
at. What a dreadful situation! As an illustration upon a large scale,
remember Jerusalem during the siege; and for a specimen in an
individual, read the story of the death-bed of Francis Spira. God takes
sure aim; who would be his target? His arrows are sharp and transfix the
heart; who would wish to be wounded by them? Ah, ye enemies of God, your
boastings will soon be over when once the shafts begin to fly!

[Psa 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#013.md)

"Be thou exalted, Lord, in thine own strength." A sweet concluding
verse. Our hearts shall join in it. It is always right to praise the
Lord when we call to remembrance his goodness to his Son, and the
overthrow of his foes. The exaltation of the name of God should be the
business of every Christian; but since such poor things as we fail to
honour him as he deserves, we may invoke his own power to aid us. Be
high, O God, but do thou maintain thy loftiness by thine own
almightiness, for no other power can worthily do it.

"So will we sing and praise thy power." For a time the saints may mourn,
but the glorious appearance of their divine Helper awakens their joy.
Joy should always flow in the channel of praise. All the attributes of
God are fitting subjects to be celebrated by the music of our hearts and
voices, and when we observe a display of his power, we must extol it. He
wrought our deliverance alone, and he alone shall have the praise.
