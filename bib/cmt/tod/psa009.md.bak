### [Psalms Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 9:0</span></span>

Title - "To the Chief Musician upon Muth labben, a Psalm of David." The
meaning of this title is very doubtful. It may refer to the tune to
which the Psalm was to be sung, so Wilcocks and others think; or it may
refer to a musical instrument now unknown, but common in those days; or
it may have a reference to Ben, who is mentioned in [Ch1
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#018.md), as one of the Levitical
singers. If either of these conjectures should be correct, the title of
Muth labben has no teaching for us, except it is meant to show us how
careful David was that in the worship of God all things should be done
according to due order. From a considerable company of learned witnesses
gather that the title will bear a meaning far more instructive, without
being fancifully forced: it signifies a Psalm concerning the death of
the Son. The Chaldee has, "concerning the death of the Champion who went
out between the camps," referring to Goliath of Garb, or some other
Philistine, on account of whose death many suppose this Psalm to have
been written in after years by David. Believing that out of a thousand
guesses this is at least as consistent with the sense of the Psalm as
any other, we prefer it; and the more especially so because it enables
us to refer it mystically to the victory of the Son of God over the
champion of evil, even the enemy of souls ([Psa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#006).md). We have here before us most
evidently a triumphal hymn; may it strengthen the faith of the militant
believer, and stimulate the courage of the timid saint, as he sees here
The Conqueror, on whose vesture and thigh is the name written, King of
kings and Lord of lords.

Order - Bonar remarks, "The position of the Psalms in their relations to
each other is often remarkable. It is questioned whether the present
arrangement of them was the order in which they were given forth to
Israel, or whether some later compiler, perhaps Ezra, was inspired to
attend to this matter, as well as to other points connected with the
canon. Without attempting to decide this point, it is enough to remark
that we have proof that the order of the Psalms is as ancient as the
completing of the canon, and if so, it seems obvious that the Holy
Spirit wished this book to come down to us in its present order. We make
these remarks, in order to invite attention to the fact, that as the
eight caught up the last line of the seventh, this ninth Psalm opens
with an apparent reference to the eighth: -

'I will praise thee, O Lord, with my whole heart;

I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.

I will be glad and rejoice in thee. (Comp. [Sol
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#004.md); [Rev
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#007)..md)

I will sing to thy name, O thou Most High.' [Psa
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#001.md), [Psa
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#002.md).

As if 'The Name,' so highly praised in the former Psalm, were still
ringing in the ear of the sweet singer of Israel. And in [Psa
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#010.md), he returns to it, celebrating
their confidence who 'know' that 'name' as if its fragrance still
breathed in the atmosphere around."

Division - The strain so continually changes, that it is difficult to
give an outline of it methodically arranged: we give the best we can
make. From [Psa 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#001.md) to [Psa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#006.md) is a song of jubilant
thanksgiving; from [Psa 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#007.md) to [Psa
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#012.md), there is a continual declaration
of faith as to the future. Prayer closes the first great division of the
Psalm in [Psa 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#013.md) and [Psa
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#014.md). The second portion of this
triumphal ode, although much shorter, is parallel in all its parts to
the first portion, and is a sort of rehearsal of it. Observe the song
for past judgments, [Psa 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#015.md), [Psa
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#016.md); the declaration of trust in
future justice, [Psa 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#017.md), [Psa
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#018.md); and the closing prayer, [Psa
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#019.md), [Psa
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#020.md). Let us celebrate the conquests
of the Redeemer as we read this Psalm, and it cannot but be a delightful
task if the Holy Ghost be with us.

the gates of death." Deep distresses. Great deliverances. Glorious
exaltations.

[Psa 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#014.md) - "I will rejoice in thy
salvation." Especially because it is thine, O God, and therefore honours
thee. In its freeness, fulness, suitability, certainty, everlastingness.
Who can rejoice in this? Reasons why they should always do so.

[Psa 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#015.md) - Lex talionis. Memorable
instances.

[Psa 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#016.md) - Awful knowledge; a
tremendous alternative as compared with [Psa

it is taught.

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Whole Psalm

We are to consider this song of praise, as I conceive, to be the
language of our great Advocate and Mediator, "in the midst of the church
giving thanks unto God," and teaching us to anticipate by faith his
great and final victory over all the adversaries of our peace temporal
and spiritual, with especial reference to his assertion of his royal
dignity on Zion, his holy mountain. The victory over the enemy, we find
by the fourth verse, is again ascribed to the decision of divine
justice, and the award of a righteous judge, who has at length resumed
his tribunal. This renders it certain, that the claim preferred to the
throne of the Almighty, could proceed from the lips of none but our
Melchizedec. - John Fry, B.A., 1842.

[Psa 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#001.md)

"I will praise thee, O Lord, with my whole heart." As a vessel by the
scent thereof tells what liquor is in it, so should our mouths smell
continually of that mercy wherewith our hearts have been refreshed: for
we are called vessels of mercy. - William Cowper, 1612.

[Psa 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#001.md)

"I will praise the Lord with my whole heart, I will shew forth all thy
marvellous works." The words, "With my whole heart," serve at once to
show the greatness of the deliverances wrought for the psalmist, and to
distinguish him from the hypocrites - the coarser, who praise the Lord
for his goodness merely with the lips; and the more refined, who praise
him with just half their heart, while they secretly ascribe the
deliverance more to themselves than to him. "All thy wonders," the
marvellous token of thy grace. The Psalmist shows by this term, that he
recognised them in all their greatness. Where this is done, there the
Lord is also praised with the whole heart. Half-heartedness, and the
depreciation of divine grace, go hand in hand. The כּ is the כּ instrum.
The heart is the instrument of praise, the mouth only its organ. - E. W.
Hengstenberg.

[Psa 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#001) (second clause.md)

When we have received any special good thing from the Lord, it is well,
according as we have opportunities, to tell others of it. When the woman
who had lost one of her ten pieces of silver, found the missing portion
of her money, she gathered her neighbours and her friends together,
saying, "Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece which I had lost."
We may do the same; we may tell friends and relations that we have
received such-and-such a blessing, and that we trace it directly to the
hand of God. Why have we not already done this? Is there a lurking
unbelief as to whether it really came from God; or are we ashamed to own
it before those who are perhaps accustomed to laugh at such things? Who
knows so much of the marvellous works of God as his own people; if they
be silent, how can we expect the world to see what he has done? Let us
not be ashamed to glorify God, by telling what we know and feel he has
done; let us watch our opportunity to bring out distinctly the fact of
his acting; let us feel delighted at having an opportunity, from our own
experience, of telling what must turn to his praise; and them that
honour God, God will honour in turn; if we be willing to talk of his
deeds, he will give us enough to talk about. - P.B. Power, in 'I Wills'
of the Psalms.

[Psa 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#001.md), [Psa
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#002.md)

"I will confess unto thee, O Lord, with my whole heart," etc. Behold,
with what a flood of the most sweet affections he says that he "will
confess," "show forth," "rejoice," "be glad," and "sing," being filled
with ecstasy! He does not simply say, "I will confess," but, "with my
heart," and "with my whole heart." Nor does he propose to speak simply
of "works," but of the "marvellous works" of God, and of "all" those
"works." Thus his spirit (like John in the womb) exults and rejoices in
God his Saviour, who has done great things for him, and those marvellous
things which follow. In which words are opened the subject of this
Psalm: that is, that he therein sings the marvellous works of God. And
these works are wonderful, because he converts, by those who are
nothing, those who have all things, and, by the Almuth who live in
hidden faith, and are dead to the world, he humbles those who flourish
in glory, and are looked upon in the world. Thus accomplishing such
mighty things without force, without arms, without labour, by the cross
only and blood. But how will his saying, that he will show forth "all"
his marvellous works, agree with that of [Job
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#010.md), "which doeth great things past
finding out; yea, and wonders without number"? For who can show forth
all the marvellous works of God? We may say, therefore, that these
things are spoken in that excess of feeling in which he said ([Psa
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#006).md), "I will water my couch with my
tears." That is, he hath such an ardent desire to speak of the wonderful
works of God, that, as far as his wishes are concerned, he would set
them "all" forth, though he could not do it, for love has neither bounds
nor end: and as Paul saith ([Co1
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#007).md), "Love beareth all things,
believeth all things, hopeth all things;" hence it can do all things,
and does do all things, for God looketh at the heart and spirit. -
Martin Luther.

[Psa 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#003.md)

"When mine enemies are turned back," etc. Were turned back, repulsed,
and put to flight. To render this in the present time, as our
translators did, is certainly improper; it destroys the coherence, and
introduces obscurity. Ainsworth saw this, and rendered in the past,
"When mine enemies turned backward." "At thy presence." That is, by
thine anger. For as God's presence or face denotes his favour to such as
fear and serve him, so it denotes his anger towards the wicked. "The
face of Jehovah is against them that do evil." - B. Boothroyd, 1824.

[Psa 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#003.md)

"They shall fall and perish." It refers to those that either faint in a
march, or are wounded in a battle, or especially that in flight meet
with galling haps in their way, and so are galled and lamed, rendered
unable to go forward, and so fall, and become liable to all the chances
of pursuits, and as here, are overtaken and perish in the fall. - Henry
Hammond, D.D.

[Psa 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#005.md)

"Thou hast rebuked the heathen," etc. - Augustine applieth all this
mystically, as is intimated ([Psa 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#001).md)
that it should be applied for, "I will speak." said he, "of all thy
wonderful works;" and what so wonderful as the turning of the spiritual
enemy backward, whether the devil, as when he said, "Get thee behind me,
Satan;" or the old man, which is turned backward when he is put off, and
the new man put on? - John Mayer.

[Psa 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#008.md)

"He shall judge the world in righteousness." In this judgment tears will
not prevail, prayers will not be heard, promises will not be admitted,
repentance will be too late; and as for riches, honourable titles,
sceptres, and diadems, these will profit much less; and the inquisition
shall be so curious and diligent, that not one light thought nor one
idle word (not repented of in the life past), shall be forgotten. For
truth itself hath said, not in jest, but in earnest, "Of every idle word
which men have spoken, they shall give an account in the day of
judgment." Oh, how many which now sin with great delight, yea, even with
greediness (as if we served a god of wood or of stone, which seeth
nothing, or can do nothing), will be then astonished, ashamed, and
silent! Then shall the days of thy mirth be ended, and thou shalt be
overwhelmed with everlasting darkness; and instead of thy pleasures,
thou shalt have everlasting torments. - Thomas Tymme.

[Psa 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#008.md)

"He shall judge the world in righteousness." Even Paul, in his great
address on Mars' Hill, a thousand years after, could find no better
words in which to teach the Athenians the doctrine of the judgment-day
than the Septuagint rendering of this clause. - William S. Plumer.

[Psa 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#008.md)

The guilty conscience cannot abide this day. The silly sheep, when she
is taken, will not bleat, but you may carry her and do what you will
with her, and she will be subject; but the swine, if she be once taken,
she will roar and cry, and thinks she is never taken but to be slain. So
of all things the guilty conscience cannot abide to hear of this day,
for they know that when they hear of it, they hear of their own
condemnation. I think if there were a general collection made through
the whole world that there might be no judgment-day, then God would be
so rich that the world would go a-begging and be a waste wilderness.
Then the covetous judge would bring forth his bribes; then the crafty
lawyer would fetch out his bags; the usurer would give his gain, and a
double thereof. But all the money in the world will not serve for our
sin, but the judge must answer his bribes, he that hath money must
answer how he came by it, and just condemnation must come upon every
soul of them; then shall the sinner be ever dying and never dead, like
the salamander, that is ever in the fire and never consumed. - Henry
Smith.

[Psa 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#009.md)

It is reported of the Egyptians that, living in the fens, and being
vexed with gnats, they used to sleep in high towers, whereby, those
creatures not being able to soar so high, they are delivered from the
biting of them' so would it be with us when bitten with cares and fear,
did we but run to God for refuge, and rest confident of his help. - John
Trapp.

[Psa 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#010.md)

"They that know thy name will put their trust in thee." Faith is an
intelligent grace; though there can be knowledge without faith, yet
there can be no faith without knowledge. One calls it quicksighted
faith. Knowledge must carry the torch before faith. [Ti2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#012.md). "For I know whom I have
believed." As in Paul's conversion a light from heaven "shined round
about him" ([Act 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#003).md), so before faith
be wrought, God shines in with a light upon the understanding. A blind
faith is as bad as a dead faith that eye may as well be said to be a
good eye which is without sight, as that faith is good without
knowledge. Devout ignorance damns; which condemns the church of Rome,
that think it a piece of their religion to be kept in ignorance; these
set up an altar to an unknown God. They say ignorance is the mother of
devotion; but sure where the sun is set in the understanding, it must
needs be night in the affections. So necessary is knowledge to the being
of faith, that the Scriptures do sometimes baptise faith with the name
of knowledge. [Isa 53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011.md). "By his
knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many." Knowledge is put
there for faith. - Thomas Watson.

[Psa 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#010.md)

"They that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, Lord,
hast not forsaken them that seek thee." The mother of unbelief is
ignorance of God, his faithfulness, mercy, and power. They that know
thee, will trust in thee. This confirmed Paul, Abraham, Sarah, in the
faith. "I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to
keep that which I have committed unto him against that day." [Ti2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#012.md), "He is faithful that promised,"
and "able also to perform." [Heb
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#023.md), and [Heb
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#011.md); [Rom
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#021.md). The free promises of the Lord
are all certain, his commandments right and good, the recompense of
reward inestimably to be valued above thousands of gold and silver;
trust therefore in the Lord, O my soul, and follow hard after him. Thou
hast his free promise, who never failed, who hath promised more than
possibly thou couldst ask or think, who hath done more for thee than
ever he promised, who is good and bountiful to the wicked and ungodly;
thou doest his work, who is able and assuredly will bear thee out. There
is a crown of glory proposed unto thee above all conceit of merit; stick
fast unto his word, and suffer nothing to divide thee from it. Rest upon
his promises though he seem to kill thee; cleave unto his statutes
though the flesh lust, the world allure, the devil tempt by flatteries
or threatenings to the contrary. - John Ball, 1632.

[Psa 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#010.md)

"They that know thy name will put their trust in thee." They can do no
otherwise who savingly know God's sweet attributes, and noble acts for
his people. We never trust a man till we know him, and bad men are
better known than trusted. Not so the Lord; for where his name is
ointment poured forth, the virgins love him, fear him, and rejoice in
him, and repose upon him. - John Trapp.

[Psa 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#012.md)

"When he maketh inquisition for blood he remembereth them." There is a
time when God will make inquisition for innocent blood. The Hebrew word
doresh, from darash, that is here rendered inquisition, signifies not
barely to seek, to search, but to seek, search, and enquire with all
diligence and care imaginable. Oh, there is a time a-coming when the
Lord will make a very diligent and careful search and enquiry after all
the innocent blood of his afflicted and persecuted people, which
persecutors and tyrants have spilt as water upon the ground; and woe to
persecutors when God shall make a more strict, critical, and careful
enquiry after the blood of his people than ever was made in the
inquisition of Spain, where all things are carried with the greatest
diligence, subtlety, secrecy, and severity. O persecutors, there is a
time a-coming, when God will make a strict enquiry after the blood of
Hooper, Bradford, Latimer, Taylor, Ridley, etc. There is a time
a-coming, wherein God will enquire who silenced and suspended
such-and-such ministers, and who stopped the mouths of such-and-such,
and who imprisoned, confined, and banished such-and-such, who were once
burning and shining lights, and who were willing to spend and be spent
that sinners might be saved, and that Christ might be glorified. There
is a time when the Lord will make a very narrow enquiry into all the
actions and practices of ecclesiastical courts, high commissions,
committees, assizes, etc, and deal with persecutors as they have dealt
with his people. - Thomas Brooks.

[Psa 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#012.md)

"When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them." There is
vox sanguinis, a voice of blood; and" he that planted the ear, shall he
not hear?" It covered the old world with waters. The earth is filled
with cruelty; it was vox sanguinis that cried, and the heavens heard the
earth, and the windows of heaven opened to let fall judgment and
vengeance upon it. - Edward Marbury, 1649.

[Psa 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#012.md)

"When he maketh inquisition for blood," etc. Though God may seem to wink
for a time at the cruelty of violent men, yet will call them at last to
a strict account for all the innocent blood they have shed, and for
their unjust and unmerciful usuage of meek and humble persons; whose cry
he never forgets (though he doth not presently answer it), but takes a
fit time to be avenged of their oppressors. - Symon Patrick, D.D.,
1626-1707.

[Psa 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#012.md)

"He maketh inquisition for blood." He is so stirred at this sin, that he
will up, search out the authors, contrivers, and commissioners of this
scarlet sin, he will avenge for blood. - William Greenhill.

[Psa 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#012.md)

"He forgetteth not the cry of the humble." Prayer is a haven to the
shipwrecked man, an anchor to them that are sinking in the waves, a
staff to the limbs that totter, a mine of jewels to the poor, a healer
of diseases, and a guardian of health. Prayer at once secures the
continuance of our blessings, and dissipates the clouds of our
calamities. O blessed prayer I thou art the unwearied conqueror of human
woes, the firm foundation of human happiness, the source of
ever-enduring joy, the mother of philosophy. The man who can pray truly,
though languishing in extremest indigence, is richer than all beside,
whilst the wretch who never bowed the knee, though proudly sitting as
monarch of all nations, is of all men most destitute. - Chrysostom.

[Psa 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#014.md)

"That I may show forth all thy praise," etc. To show forth all God's
praise is to enter largely into the work. An occasional "God, I thank
thee," is no fit return for a perpetual stream of rich benefits. -
William S. Plumer.

[Psa 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#015.md)

"The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made," etc. Whilst they
are digging pits for others, there is a pit a-digging and a grave
a-making for themselves. They have a measure to make up, and a treasure
to fill, which at length will be broken open, which, methinks, should
take off them which are set upon mischief from pleasing themselves in
their plots. Alas! they are but plotting their own ruin, and building a
Babel which will fall upon their own heads. If there were any
commendation in plotting, then that great plotter of plotters, that
great engineer, Satan, would go beyond us all and take all the credit
from us. But let us not envy Satan and his in their glory. They had need
of something to comfort them. Let them please themselves with their
trade. The day is coming wherein the daughter of Sion shall laugh them
to scorn. There will be a time wherein it shall be said, "Arise, Sion,
and thresh." [Mic 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#013.md). And usually
the delivery of God's children is joined with the destruction of his
enemies; Saul's death, and David's deliverance; the Israelites'
deliverance, and the Egyptians' drowning. The church and her opposites
are like the scales of a balance; when one goes up, the other goes down.
- Richard Sibbs.

[Psa 9:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#015.md)

It will much increase the torment of the damned, in that their torments
will be as large and strong as their understandings and affections,
which will cause those violent passions to be still working. Were their
loss never so great, and their sense of it never so passionate, yet if
they could but lose the use of their memory, those passions would die,
and that loss being forgotten, would little trouble them. But as they
cannot lay by their life and being, though then they would account
annihilation of singular mercy, so neither can they lay aside any part
of their being. Understanding, conscience, affections, memory, must all
live to torment them, which should have helped to their happiness. And
as by these they should have fed upon the love of God, and drawn forth
perpetually the joys of his presence, so by these must they now feed
upon the wrath of God, and draw forth continually the dolours of his
absence. Therefore, never think, that when I say the hardness of their
hearts, and their blindness, dullness, and forgetfulness shall be
removed, that therefore they are more holy and happy than before: no,
but morally more vile, and hereby far more miserable. Oh, how many times
did God by his messengers here call upon them, "Sinners, consider
whither you are going. Do but make a stand awhile, and think where your
way will end, what is the offered glory that you so carelessly reject:
will not this be bitterness in the end?" And yet these men would never
be brought to consider, But in the latter days, saith the Lord, they
shall perfectly consider it, when they are ensnared in the work of their
own hands, when God hath arrested them, and judgment is passed upon
them, and vengeance is poured out upon them to the full, then they
cannot choose but consider it, whether they will or no. Now they have no
leisure to consider, nor any room in their memories for the things of
another life. Ah! but then they shall have leisure enough, they shall be
where they shall have nothing else to do but consider it their memories
shall have no other employment to hinder them; it shall even be engraven
upon the tables of their hearts. God would have the doctrine of their
eternal state to have been written on the posts of their doors, on their
houses, on their hands, and on their hearts: he would have had them mind
it and mention it, as they rise and lie down, and as they walk abroad,
that so it might have gone well with them at their latter end. And
seeing they rejected this counsel of the Lord, therefore shall it be
written always before them in the place of their thraldom, that which
way soever they look they may still behold it. - Richard Baxter.

[Psa 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#016.md)

"The Lord is known by the judgment which he executeth." Now if the Lord
be known by the judgment which he executeth; then, the judgment which he
executeth must be known; it must be an open judgment; and such are very
many of the judgments of God, they are acted as upon a stage. And I may
give you an account in three particulars why the Lord will sometimes do
justice in the place of beholders, or in the open sight of others.
First, that there may be witnesses enough of what he doth, and so a
record of it be kept, at least in the minds and memories of faithful men
for the generations to come. Secondly, the Lord doth it not only that he
may have witnesses of his justice, but also that his justice and the
proceedings of it, may have effect and a fruit upon those who did not
feel it, nor fall under it. This was the reason why the Lord threatened
to punish Jerusalem in the sight of the nations. [Eze
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#006.md), [Eze
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#007.md), [Eze
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#008.md), [Eze
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#014.md), [Eze
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#015.md).... God would execute judgment in
Jerusalem, a city placed in the midst of the nations that as the nations
had taken notice of the extraordinary favours, benefits, deliverances,
and salvations which God wrought for Jerusalem, so they might also take
notice of his judgments and sore displeasure against them. Jerusalem was
not seated in some nook, corner, or by-place of the world, but in the
midst of the nations, that both the goodness and severity of God towards
them might be conspicuous.... God lets some sinners suffer, or punisheth
them openly, both because he would have all others take notice that he
dislikes what they have done, as also because he would not have others
do the like, lest they be made like them, both in the matter and manner
of their sufferings. 'Tis a favour as well as our duty, to be taught by
other men's harms, and to be instructed by their strokes to prevent our
own.... Thirdly, God strikes some wicked men in open view, or in the
place of beholders for the comfort of his own people, and for their
encouragement. [Psa 58:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#010.md), [Psa
58:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#011.md). "The righteous shall rejoice
when he seeth the vengeance;" not that he shall be glad of the
vengeance, purely as it is a hurt or a suffering to the creature; but
the righteous shall be glad when he seeth the vengeance of God as it is
a fulfilling of the threatening of God against the sin of man, and an
evidence of his own holiness.... It is said ([Exo
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#030.md), [Exo
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#031).md), that God having overwhelmed
the Egyptians in the Red Sea, the Israelites saw the Egyptians dead upon
the sea shore: God did not suffer the carcases of the Egyptians to sink
to the bottom of the sea, but caused them to lie upon the shore, that
the Israelites might see them; and when Israel saw that dreadful stroke
of the Lord upon the Egyptians, it is said, "The people feared the Lord,
and believed the Lord, and his servant Moses." Thus they were confirmed
in their faith by God's open judgments upon the Egyptians. They were
smitten in the place of beholders, or in the open sight of others. -
Condensed from Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#016.md)

"The Lord is known by the judgments which he executeth;" when he lays
his hand upon sinners, saints tremble, consider his power, majesty,
greatness, the nature of his judgments, and so judge themselves, and
remove out of the way whatever may provoke.... As fire begets a
splendour round about where it is, so do the judgments of God set out to
the world his glory, justice, holiness. - William Greenhill.

[Psa 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#016.md)

"Shared in the work of his own hands." The wages that sin bargains with
the sinner are life, pleasure and profit; but the wages it pays him with
are death, torment, and destruction. He that would understand the
falsehood and deceit of sin, must compare its promises and its payments
together. - Robert South, D.D., 1633-1716.

[Psa 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#016.md)

"Higgaion, Selah," that is, as Ainsworth renders it, "Meditation,
Selah:" showing this ought to be seriously considered of. The word
"Higgaion" is again had ([Psa 92:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#003).md);
being mentioned among other musical instruments, whereby we may gather
it to be one of them; for there is psaltery, nable, higgaion, and harp.
- John Mayer.

[Psa 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#016.md)

"The wicked is snared in the works of his own hands." Not only do we
read it in the word of God, but all history, all experience, records the
same righteous justice of God, in snaring the wicked in the work of
their own hands. Perhaps the most striking instance on record, next to
Haman on his own gallows, is one connected with the horrors of the
French Revolution, in which we are told that, "within nine months of the
death of the queen Marie Antoinette by the guillotine, every one
implicated in her untimely end, her accusers, the judges, the jury, the
prosecutors, the witnesses, all, every one at least whose fate is known,
perished by the same instrument as their innocent victim." "In the net
which they had laid for her was their own foot taken - into the pit
which they digged for her did they themselves fall." - Barton Bouchier,
1855.

[Psa 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#017.md)

The ungodly at death must undergo God's fury and indignation. "The
wicked shall be turned into hell." I have read of a loadstone in
Ethiopia which hath two corners, with one it draws the iron to it, with
the other it puts the iron from it; so God hath two hands, of mercy and
justice; with the one he will draw the godly to heaven, with the other
he will thrust the sinner to hell; and oh, how dreadful is that place!
It is called a fiery lake ([Rev
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#015).md); a lake, to denote the plenty
of torments in hell; a fiery lake to show the fierceness of them: fire
is the most torturing element. Strabo in his geography mentions a lake
in Galilee of such a pestiferous nature that it scaldeth off the skin of
whatsoever is cast into it; but, alas! that lake is cool compared with
this fiery lake into which the damned are thrown. To demonstrate this
fire terrible, there are two most pernicious qualities in it. 1. It is
sulphureous, it is mixed with brimstone ([Rev
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#008).md), which is unsavoury and
suffocating. 2. It is inextinguishable; though the wicked shall be
choked in the flames, yet not consumed ([Rev
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#010).md); "And the devil was cast into
the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet
are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever." Behold the
deplorable condition of all ungodly ones in the other world, they shall
have a life that always dies, and a death that always lives: may not
this affright men out of their sins, and make them become godly? unless
they are resolved to try how hot the hell-fire is. - Thomas Watson.

[Psa 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#017.md)

"The wicked shall be turned into hell," etc. By "the wicked" man we must
understand unregenerate persons, whoever they are that are in a state of
unregeneracy.... That person is here spoken of us a "wicked" man that
"forgets God," who does not think of him frequently, and with affection,
with fear and delight, and those affections that are suitable to serious
thoughts of God.... To forget God and to be a wicked person is all one.
And these two things will abundantly evince the truth of this assertion:
namely, that this forgetfulness of God excludes the prime and main
essentials of religion, and also includes in it the highest and most
heinous pieces of wickedness, and therefore must needs denominate the
subject, a wicked person.... Forgetfulness of God excludes the principal
and essential parts of religion. It implies that a man doth neither
esteem nor value the all-sufficiency and holiness of God, as his
happiness and portion, as his strength and support; nor doth he fear
him, nor live in subjection to his laws and commands, as his rule; nor
doth he aim at the glory of God as his end: therefore every one who thus
forgets God must certainly be a wicked person.... To exclude God out of
our thoughts and not to let him have a place there, not to mind, nor
think upon God, is the greatest wickedness of the thoughts that can be.
And, therefore, though you cannot say of such a one, he will be drunk,
or he will swear, cozen, or oppress; yet if you can say he will forget
God, or that he lives all his days never minding nor thinking upon God,
you say enough to speak him under wrath, and to turn him into hell
without remedy. - John Howe, 1630-1705.

[Psa 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#017.md)

"The wicked shall be turned into hell." לשׁאולהLisholah - head-long into
hell, down into hell. The original is very emphatic. - Adam Clarke.

[Psa 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#017.md)

All wickedness came originally with the wicked one from hell; thither it
will be again remitted, and they who hold on its side must accompany it
on its return to that place of torment, there to be shut up for ever.
The true state both of "nations," and the individuals of which they are
composed, is to be estimated from one single circumstance; namely,
whether in their doings they remember, or "forget God." Remembrance of
him is the well-spring of virtue; forgetfulness of him, the fountain of
vice. - George Horne, D.D.

[Psa 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#017.md)

Hell, their fit habitation, fraught with fire

Unquenchable, the house of woe and pain.

John Milton, 1608-1674.

[Psa 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#017.md)

Will without power, the element of hell,

Abortive all its acts returning still

Upon itself;.... Oh, anguish terrible!

Meet guerdon of self-love, its proper ill!

Malice would scowl upon the foe he fears;

And he with lip of scorn would seek to kill;

But neither sees the other, neither hears -

For darkness each in his own dungeon bars,

Lust pines for dearth, and grief drinks its own tears -

Each in its solitude apart. Hate wars

Against himself, and feeds upon his chain,

Whose iron penetrates the soul it scars,

A dreadful solitude each mind insane,

Each its own place, its prison all alone,

And finds no sympathy to soften pain.

J. A. Heraud.

[Psa 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#018.md)

"For the needy shall not alway be forgotten," etc. This is a sweet
promise for a thousand occasions, and when pleaded before the throne in
his name who comprehends in himself every promise, and is indeed himself
the great promise of the Bible, it would be found like all others, yea
and amen. - Robert Hawker, D.D., 1820.

[Psa 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#018.md)

"The expectation of the poor shall not perish." A heathen could say,
when a bird, scared by a hawk, flew into his bosom, I will not betray
thee unto thy enemy, seeing thou comest for sanctuary unto me. How much
less will God yield up a soul unto its enemy, when it takes sanctuary in
his name, saying, Lord I am haunted with such a temptation, dogged with
such a lust; either thou must pardon it, or I am damned; mortify it, or
I shall be a slave to it; take me into the bosom of thy love for
Christ's sake; castle me in the arms of thy everlasting strength; it is
in thy power to save me from, or give me up into the hands of my enemy;
I have no confidence in myself or any other: into thy hands I commit my
cause myself, and rely on thee. This dependence of a soul undoubtedly
will awaken the almighty power of God for such a one's defence lie hath
sworn the greatest oath that can come out of his blessed lips, even by
himself, that such as thus fly for refuge to hope in him, shall have
strong consolation. [Heb 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#017.md). This
indeed may give the saint the greater boldness of faith to expect kind
entertainment when he repairs to God for refuge, because he cannot come
before he is looked for; God having set up his name and promises as a
strong tower, both calls his people into these chambers and expects they
should betake themselves thither. - William Gurnall.

[Psa 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#018.md)

As sometimes God is said to hear us in not hearing, us, so we may say he
should sometimes deny us if he did not delay us. It is (saith
Chrysostom) like money, which lying long in the bank, comes home at last
with a duck in its mouth, with use upon use; when money is out a great
time, it makes a great return: we can stay thus upon men, and cannot we,
shall not we, stay upon the Lord, and for the Lord, for a large return.
God causeth us by delay to make the more prayers; and the more we pray,
the longer we stay, the more comfort we shall have, and the more sure we
are that we shall have it in the latter end. Distinguish between denying
and delaying.... In God our Father are all dimensions of love, and that
in an infinite degree; infinitely infinite: what if he defer us? so do
we our children, albeit we mean no other but to give them their own
asking, yet we love to see them wait, that so they may have from us the
best things when they are at the best, in the best time, and in the best
manner: if a mother should forget her only boy, yet God hath an infinite
memory, he nor can, nor will forget; the expectation of the waiter shall
not fail for ever, that is, never. - Richard Capel.

[Psa 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#019.md)

"Arise, O Lord," etc. What does this mean? Are we to consider the
Psalmist as praying for the destruction of his enemies, as pronouncing a
malediction, a curse upon them? No; these are not the words of one who
is wishing that mischief may happen to his enemies; they are the words
of a prophet, of one who is foretelling, in Scripture language, the evil
that must befall them on account of their sins. - Augustine.

[Psa 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#020.md)

"Put them in fear, O Lord," etc. We should otherwise think ourselves
gods. We are so inclined to sin that we need strong restraints, and so
swelled with a natural pride against God, that we need thorns in the
flesh to let out the corrupt matter. The constant hanging the rod over
us makes us lick the dust, and acknowledge ourselves to be altogether at
the Lord's mercy. Though God hath pardoned us, he will make us wear the
halter about our necks to humble us. - Stephen Charnock.

[Psa 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#020.md)

"That the nations may know themselves to be but men." The original word
is אנושׁ, enosh; and therefore it is a prayer that they may know
themselves to be but miserable, frail, and dying men. The word is in the
singular number, but it is used collectively. - John Calvin.

[Psalms 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 9:1</span></span>

1 I will praise thee, O Lord, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all
thy marvellous works.

2 I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O
thou most High.

3 When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy
presence.

4 For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the
throne judging right.

5 Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou
hast put out their name for ever and ever.

6 O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast
destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.

[Psa 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#001.md)

With a holy resolution the songster begins his hymn; I will praise the O
Lord. It sometimes needs all our determination to face the foe and bless
the Lord in the teeth of his enemies; vowing that whoever else may be
silent we will bless his name; here, however, the overthrow of the foe
is viewed as complete, and the song flows with sacred fulness of
delight. It is our duty to praise the Lord; let us perform it as a
privilege. Observe that David's praise is all given to the Lord. Praise
is to be offered to God alone; we may be grateful to the intermediate
agent, but our thanks must have long wings and mount aloft to heaven.
With my whole heart. Half heart is no heart. I will show forth. There is
true praise in the thankful telling forth to others of our heavenly
Father's dealings with us; this is one of the themes upon which the
godly should speak often to one another, and it will not be casting
pearls before swine if we make even the ungodly hear of the
loving-kindness of the Lord to us. All thy marvellous works. Gratitude
for one mercy refreshes the memory as to thousands of others. One silver
link in the chain draws up a long series of tender remembrances. Here is
eternal work for us, for there can be no end to the showing forth of all
his deeds of love. If we consider our own sinfulness and nothingness, we
must feel that every work of preservation, forgiveness, conversion,
deliverance, sanctification, &c., which the Lord has wrought for us, or
in us is a marvellous work. Even in heaven, divine loving-kindness will
doubtless be as much a theme of surprise as of rapture.

[Psa 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#002.md)

Gladness and joy are the appropriate spirit in which to praise the
goodness of the Lord. Birds extol the Creator in notes of overflowing
joy, the cattle low forth his praise with tumult of happiness, and the
fish leap up in his worship with excess of delight. Moloch may be
worshipped with shrieks of pain, and Juggernaut may be honoured by dying
groans and inhuman yells, but he whose name is Love is best pleased with
the holy mirth, and sanctified gladness of his people. Daily rejoicing
is an ornament to the Christian character, and a suitable robe for God's
choristers to wear. God loveth a cheerful giver, whether it be the gold
of his purse or the gold of his mouth which he presents upon his altar.
I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High. Songs are the fitting
expressions of inward thankfulness, and it were well if we indulged
ourselves and honoured our Lord with more of them. Mr. B. P. Power has
well said, "The sailors give a cheery cry as they weigh anchor, the
ploughman whistles in the morning as he drives his team; the milkmaid
sings her rustic song as she sets about her early task; when soldiers
are leaving friends behind them, they do not march out to the tune of
the Dead March in 'Saul,' but to the quick notes of some lively air. A
praising spirit would do for us all that their songs and music do for
them; and if only we could determine to praise the Lord, we should
surmount many a difficulty which our low spirits never would have been
equal to, and we should do double the work which can be done if the
heart be languid in its beating, if we be crushed and trodden down in
soul. As the evil spirit in Saul yielded in the olden time to the
influence of the harp of the son of Jesse, so would the spirit of
melancholy often take flight from us, if only we would take up the song
of praise."

[Psa 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#003.md)

God's presence is evermore sufficient to work the defeat of our most
furious foes, and their ruin is so complete when the Lord takes them in
hand, that even flight cannot save them, they fall to rise no more when
he pursues them. We must be careful, like David, to give all the glory
to him whose presence gives the victory. If we have here the exultings
of our conquering Captain, let us make the triumphs of the Redeemer the
triumphs of the redeemed, and rejoice with him at the total discomfiture
of all his foes.

[Psa 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#004.md)

One of our nobility has for his motto, "I will maintain it;" but the
Christian has a better and more humble one, "Thou hast maintained it."
"God and my right," are united by my faith: while God lives my right
shall never be taken from me. If we seek to maintain the cause and
honour of our Lord we may suffer reproach and misrepresentation, but it
is a rich comfort to remember that he who sits in the throne knows our
hearts, and will not leave us to the ignorant and ungenerous judgment of
erring man.

[Psa 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#005.md)

God rebukes before he destroys, but when he once comes to blows with the
wicked he ceases not until he has dashed them in pieces so small that
their very name is forgotten, and like a noisome snuff, their
remembrance is put out for ever and ever. How often the word "thou"
occurs in this and the former verse, to show us that the grateful strain
mounts up directly to the Lord as doth the smoke from the altar when the
air is still. My soul send up all the music of all thy powers to him who
has been and is thy sure deliverance.

[Psa 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#006.md)

Here the Psalmist exults over the fallen foe: lie bends as it were, over
his prostrate form, and insults his once vaunted strength. He plucks the
boaster's song out of his mouth, and sings it for him in derision. After
this fashion doth our Glorious Redeemer ask of death, "Where is thy
sting?" and of the grave, "Where is thy victory?" The spoiler is
spoiled, and he who made captive is led into captivity himself. Let the
daughters of Jerusalem go forth to meet their King, and praise him with
timbrel and harp.

[Psalms 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 9:7</span></span>

7 But the Lord shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for
judgment.

8 And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister
judgment to the people in uprightness.

9 The Lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of
trouble.

10 And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee for thou
Lord, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.

11 Sing praises to the Lord, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the
people his doings.

12 When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he
forgetteth not the cry of the humble.

In the light of the past the future is not doubtful. Since the same
Almighty God fills the throne of power, we can with unhesitating
confidence, exult in our security for all time to come.

[Psa 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#007.md)

The enduring existence and unchanging dominion of our Jehovah, are the
firm foundations of our joy. The enemy and his destructions shall come
to a perpetual end, but God and his throne shall endure for ever. The
eternity of divine sovereignty yields unfailing consolation. By the
throne being prepared for judgment, are we not to understand the
swiftness of divine justice. In heaven's court suitors are not worn out
with long delays. Term-time lasts all the year round in the court of
King's Bench above. Thousands may come at once to the throne of the
Judge of all the earth, but neither plaintiff nor defendant shall have
to complain that he is not prepared to give their cause a fair hearing.

[Psa 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#008.md)

Whatever earthly courts may do, heaven's throne ministers judgment in
uprightness. Partiality and respect of persons are things unknown in the
dealings of the Holy One of Israel. How the prospect of appearing before
the impartial tribunal of the Great King should act as a check to us
when tempted to sin, and as a comfort when we are slandered or
oppressed.

[Psa 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#009.md)

He who gives no quarter to the wicked in the day of judgment, is the
defence and refuge of his saints in the day of trouble. There are many
forms of oppression; both from man and from Satan oppression come to us;
and for all its forms, a refuge is provided in the Lord Jehovah. There
were cities of refuge under the law, God is our refuge-city under the
gospel. As the ships when vexed with tempest make for harbour, so do the
oppressed hasten to the wings of a just and gracious God. He is a high
tower so impregnable, that the hosts of hell cannot carry it by storm,
and from its lofty heights faith looks down with scorn upon her enemies.

[Psa 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#010.md)

Ignorance is worst when it amounts to ignorance of God, and knowledge is
best when it exercises itself upon the name of God. This most excellent
knowledge leads to the most excellent grace of faith. O, to learn more
of the attributes and character of God. Unbelief, that hooting
nightbird, cannot live in the light of divine knowledge, it flies before
the sun of God's great and gracious name. If we read this verse
literally, there is, no doubt, a glorious fulness of assurance in the
names of God. We have recounted them in the "Hints for Preachers," and
would direct the reader's attention to them. By knowing his name is also
meant an experimental acquaintance with the attributes of God, which are
everyone of them anchors to hold the soul from drifting in seasons of
peril. The Lord may hide his face for a season from his people, but he
never has utterly, finally, really, or angrily, forsaken them that seek
him. Let the poor seekers draw comfort from this fact, and let the
finders rejoice yet more exceedingly, for what must be the Lord's
faithfulness to those who find if he is so gracious to those who seek.

"O hope of every contrite heart,

O joy of all the meek,

To those who fall how kind thou art,

How good to those who seek.

But what to those who find, ah, this

Nor tongue nor pen can show

The love of Jesus what it is,

None but his loved ones know."

[Psa 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#011.md)

Being full of gratitude himself, our inspired author is eager to excite
others to join the strain, and praise God in the same manner as he had
himself vowed to do in the first and second verses. The heavenly spirit
of praise is gloriously contagious, and he that hath it is never content
unless he can excite all who surround him to unite in his sweet employ.
Singing and preaching, as means of glorifying God, are here joined
together, and it is remarkable that, connected with all revivals of
gospel ministry, there has been a sudden outburst of the spirit of song.
Luther's Psalms and Hymns were in all men's mouths, and in the modern
revival under Wesley and Whitfield, the strains of Charles Wesley,
Cennick, Berridge, Toplady, Hart, Newton, and many others, were the
outgrowth of restored piety. The singing of the birds of praise fitly
accompanies the return of the gracious spring of divine visitation
through the proclamation of the truth. Sing on brethren, and preach on,
and these snail both be a token that the Lord still dwelleth in Zion. It
will be well for us when coming up to Zion, to remember that the Lord
dwells among his saints, and is to be had in peculiar reverence of all
those that are about him.

When an inquest is held concerning the blood of the oppressed, the
martyred saints will have the first remembrance; he will avenge his own
elect. Those saints who are living shall also be heard; they shall be
exonerated from blame, and kept from destruction, even when the Lord's
most terrible work is going on; the man with the inkhorn by his side
shall mark them all for safety, before the slaughtermen are permitted to
smite the Lord's enemies. The humble cry of the poorest saints shall
neither be drowned by the voice of thundering justice nor by the shrieks
of the condemned.

[Psalms 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 9:13</span></span>

13 Have mercy upon me, O Lord; consider my trouble which I suffer of
them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:

14 That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of
Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.

Memories of the past and confidences concerning the future conducted the
man of God to the mercy seat to plead for the needs of the present.
Between praising and praying he divided all his time. How could he have
spent it more profitably? His first prayer is one suitable for all
persons and occasions, it breathes a humble spirit, indicates self
knowledge, appeals to the proper attributes, and to the fitting person.
Have mercy upon me, O Lord. Just as Luther used to call some texts
little Bibles, so we may call this sentence a little prayer-book for it
has in it the soul and marrow of prayer. It is multum in parvo, and like
the angelic sword turns every way. The ladder looks to be short, but it
reaches from earth to heaven.

What a noble title is here given to the Most High. Thou that liftest me
up the gates of death! What a glorious lift! In sickness, in sin, in
despair, in temptation, we have been brought very low, and the gloomy
portal has seemed as if it would open to imprison us, but, underneath us
were the everlasting arms, and, therefore, we have been uplifted even to
the gates of heaven. Trapp quaintly says, "He commonly reserveth his
hand for a dead lift, and rescueth those who were even talking of their
graves." We must not overlook David's object in desiring mercy, it is
God's glory: "that I may show forth all thy praise." Saints are not so
selfish as to look only to self; they desire mercy's diamond that they
may let others see it flash and sparkle, and may admire Him who gives
such priceless gems to his beloved. The contrast between the gates of
death and the gates of the New Jerusalem is very striking; let our songs
be excited to the highest and most rapturous pitch by the double
consideration of whence we are taken, and to what we have been advanced,
and let our prayers for mercy be made more energetic and agonizing by a
sense of the grace which such a salvation implies. When David speaks of
his showing forth all God's praise, he means that, in his deliverance
grace in all its heights and depths would be magnified. Just as our hymn
puts it: -

"O the length and breadth of love!

Jesus, Saviour, can it be?

All thy mercy's height I prove,

All the depth is seen in me."

Here ends the first part of this instructive psalm, and in pausing
awhile we feel bound to confess that our exposition has only flitted
over its surface, and has not digged into the depths. The verses are
singularly full of teaching, and if the Holy Spirit shall bless the
reader, he may go over this Psalm, as the writer has done scores of
times, and see on each occasion fresh beauties.

[Psalms 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 9:15</span></span>

15 The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which
they hid is their own foot taken.

16 The Lord is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked is
snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.

In considering this terrible picture of the Lord's overwhelming
judgments of his enemies, we are called upon to ponder and meditate upon
it with deep seriousness by the two untranslated words, Higgaion, Selah.
Meditate, pause. Consider, and tune your instrument. Bethink yourselves
and solemnly adjust your hearts to the solemnity which is so well
becoming the subject. Let us in a humble spirit approach these verses,
and notice, first, that the character of God requires the punishment of
sin. Jehovah is known by the judgment which he executeth; his holiness
and abhorrence of sin are thus displayed. A ruler who winked at evil
would soon be known by all his subjects to be evil himself, and he, on
the other hand, who is severely just in judgment reveals his own nature
thereby. So long as our God is God, he will not, he cannot spare the
guilty; except through that one glorious way in which he is just, and
yet the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus. We must notice,
secondly, that the manner of his judgment is singularly wise, and
indisputably just. He makes the wicked become their own executioners.
"The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made, &c." Like cunning
hunters they prepared a pitfall for the godly and fell into it
themselves the foot of the victim escaped their crafty snares, but the
toils surrounded themselves: the cruel snare was laboriously
manufactured, and it proved its efficacy by snaring its own maker.
Persecutors and oppressors are often ruined by their own malicious
projects. "Drunkards kill themselves; prodigals beggar themselves;" the
contentious are involved in ruinous costs; the vicious are devoured with
fierce diseases; the envious eat their own hearts; and blasphemers curse
their own souls. Thus, men may read their sin in their punishment. They
sowed the seed of sin, and the ripe fruit of damnation is the natural
result.

[Psalms 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 9:17</span></span>

17 The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget
God.

18 For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the
poor shall not perish for ever.

[Psa 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#017.md)

The justice which has punished the wicked, and preserved the righteous,
remains the same, and therefore in days to come, retribution will surely
be meted out. How solemn is the seventeenth verse, especially in its
warning to forgetters of God. The moral who are not devout, the honest
who are not prayerful, the benevolent who are not believing, the amiable
who are not converted, these must all have their portion with the openly
wicked in the hell which is prepared for the devil and his angels. There
are whole nations of such; the forgetters of God are far more numerous
than the profane or profligate, and according to the very forceful
expression of the Hebrew, the nethermost hell will be the place into
which all of them shall be hurled headlong. Forgetfulness seems a small
sin, but it brings eternal wrath upon the man who lives and dies in it.

[Psa 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#018.md)

Mercy is as ready to her work as ever justice can be. Needy souls fear
that they are forgotten; well, if it be so, let them rejoice that they
shall not alway be so. Satan tells poor tremblers that their hope shall
perish, but they have here divine assurance that their expectation shall
not perish for ever. "The Lord's people are a humbled people, afflicted,
emptied, sensible of need, driven to a daily attendance on God, daily
begging of him, and living upon the hope of what is promised;" such
persons may have to wait, but they shall find that they do not wait in
vain.

[Psalms 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 9:19</span></span>

19 Arise, O Lord; let not man prevail; let the heathen be judged in thy
sight.

20 Put them in fear, O Lord, that the nations may know themselves to be
but men. Selah.

[Psa 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#019.md)

Prayers are the believer's weapons of war. When the battle is too hard
for us, we call in our great ally, who, as it were, lies in ambush until
faith gives the signal by crying out, "Arise, O Lord." Although our
cause be all but lost, it shall be soon won again if the Almighty doth
but bestir himself. He will not suffer man to prevail over God, but with
swift judgments will confound their gloryings. In the very sight of God
the wicked will be punished, and he who is now all tenderness will have
no bowels of compassion for them, since they had no tears of repentance
while their day of grace endured.

[Psa 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#020.md)

One would think that men would not grow so vain as to deny themselves to
be but men, but it appears to be a lesson which only a divine
schoolmaster can teach to some proud spirits. Crowns leave their wearers
but men, degrees of eminent learning make their owners not more than
men, valour and conquest cannot elevate beyond the dead level of "but
men;" and all the wealth of Croesus, the wisdom of Solon, the power of
Alexander, the eloquence of Demosthenes, if added together, would leave
the possessor but a man. May we ever remember this, lest like those in
the text, we should be put in fear.

Before leaving this Psalm, it will be very profitable if the student
will peruse it again as the triumphal hymn of the Redeemer, as he
devoutly brings the glory of his victories and lays it down at his
Father's feet. Let us joy in his joy, and our joy shall be full.
