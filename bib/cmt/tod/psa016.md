[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 16:0</span></span>

Title - Michtam of David. This is usually understood to mean the golden
psalm, and such a title is most appropriate, for the matter is as the
most fine gold. Ainsworth calls it "David's jewel, or notable song." Dr.
Hawker, who is always alive to passages full of savour, devoutly cries,
"Some have rendered it precious, others golden, and others, precious
jewel; and as the Holy Ghost, by the apostles Peter and Paul, hath shown
us that it is all about the Lord Jesus Christ, what is here said of him
is precious, is golden, is a jewel indeed!" We have not met with the
term Michtam before, but if spared to write upon [Psa
56:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001.md), [Psa
57:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md), [Psa
58:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#001.md), 59 and [Psa
60:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#001.md), we shall see it again, and
shall observe that like the present these Psalms, although they begin
with prayer, and imply trouble, abound in holy confidence and close with
songs of assurance as to ultimate safety and joy. Dr. Alexander, whose
notes are peculiarly valuable, thinks that the word is most probably a
simple derivative of a word signifying to hide, and signifies a secret
or mystery, and indicates the depth of doctrinal and spiritual import in
these sacred compositions. If this be the true interpretation it well
accords with the other, and when the two are put together, they make up
a name which every reader will remember, and which will bring the
precious subject at once to mind. The Psalm of the Precious Secret.

Subject - We are not left to human interpreters for the key to this
golden mystery, for, speaking by the Holy Ghost, Peter tells us, "David
speaketh concerning Him." ([Act 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#025).md).
Further on in his memorable sermon he said, "Men and brethren, let me
freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and
buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day. Therefore being a
prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the
fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to
sit on his throne; he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of
Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see
corruption." ([Act 2:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#029)..md) Nor is
this our only guide, for the apostle Paul, led by the same infallible
inspiration, quotes from this Psalm, and testifies that David wrote of
the man through whom is preached unto us the forgiveness of sins. ([Act
13:35-38](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#035)..md) It has been the usual plan
of commentators to apply the Psalm both to David, to the saints, and to
the Lord Jesus, but we will venture to believe that in it "Christ is
all;" since in the ninth and tenth verses, like the apostles on the
mount, we can see "no man but Jesus only."

Division - The whole is so compact that it is difficult to draw sharp
lines of division. It may suffice to note our Lord's prayer of faith,
[Psa 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001.md), avowal of faith in Jehovah
alone, [Psa 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002.md), [Psa
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#003.md), [Psa
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#004.md), [Psa
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005.md), the contentment of his faith in
the present, [Psa 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#006.md), [Psa
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#007.md), and the joyous confidence of his
faith for the future ([Psa 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#008.md), [Psa
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011)..md)

Hints to Preachers

Michtam of David - Under the title of "The Golden Psalm," Mr. Canon Dale
has published a small volume, which is valuable as a series of good
simple discourses, but ought hardly to have been styled "an exposition."
We have thought it right to give the headings of the chapters into which
his volume is divided, for there is much showiness, and may be some
solidity in the suggestions.

[Psa 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001.md) - The seeking of the gold.
The believer conscious of danger, trusting in God only for deliverance.

[Psa 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002.md), [Psa
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#003.md) - The possessing of the gold. The
believer looking for justification to the righteousness of God alone,
while maintaining personal holiness by companionship with the saints.

[Psa 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#004.md), [Psa
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005.md) - The testing of the gold. The
believer finding his present portion, and expecting his eternal
inheritance in the Lord.

[Psa 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#006.md) - The prizing or valuing of
the gold. The believer congratulating himself on the pleasantness of his
dwelling and the goodness of his heritage,

[Psa 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#007.md), [Psa
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#008.md) - The occupying of the gold. The
believer seeking instruction from the counsels of the Lord by night, and
realising his promise by day.

[Psa 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#009.md), [Psa
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010.md) - The summing or reckoning of
the gold. The believer rejoicing and praising God for the promise of a
rest in hope and resurrection into glory.

[Psa 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011.md) - The perfecting of the
gold. The believer realising at God's right hand the fulness of joy and
the pleasures for evermore.

also. The believer, therefore, can also say, "Thou wilt show me the path

its plenitude - it is "fulness" of joy. The third regards its permanency
- the pleasures are "for evermore." - William Jay.

[Psa 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011.md) - A sweet picture of
heaven, (See Exposition.)

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Title

There is a diversity of opinion as to the meaning of the title of this
Psalm. It is called "Michtam of David," but Michtam is the Hebrew word
untranslated - the Hebrew word in English letters - and its
signification is involved in obscurity. According to some, it is derived
from a verb which means to hide, and denotes a mystery or secret. Those
who adopt this view regard the title as indicating a depth of doctrinal
and spiritual import in the Psalm, which neither the writer nor any of
his contemporaries had fathomed. According to others, it is derived from
a verb which means to cut, to grave, to write, and denotes simply a
writing of David. With this view agree the Chaldee and Septuagint
versions, the former translating it, "a straight sculpture of David;"
and the latter, "an inscription upon a pillar to David." Others again,
look upon "Michtam," as being derived from a noun which means gold, and
they understand it as denoting a golden Psalm - a Psalm of surpassing
excellence, and worthy of being written in letters of gold. This was the
opinion of our translators, and hence they have rendered it on the
margin - "A golden Psalm of David." The works of the most excellent
Arabian poets were called golden, because they were written in letters
of gold; and this golden song may have been written and hung up in some
conspicuous part of the Temple. Many other interpretations have been
given of this term, but at this distance of time, we can only regard it
as representing some unassignable peculiarity of the composition. -
James Frame, 1858.

Title

Such are the riches of this Psalm, that some have been led to think the
obscure title, "Michtam," has been prefixed to it on account of its
golden stores. For כּחס is used of the "gold of Ophir" (e.g., [Psa
45:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#009).md), and מכתּם might be a derivative
from that root. But as there is a group of five other Psalms (namely,
[Psa 56:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001.md), [Psa
57:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md), [Psa
58:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#001.md), 59, [Psa
60:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#001).md), that bear this title, whose
subject-matter is various, but which all end in a tone of triumph, it
has been suggested that the Septuagint may be nearly right in their
Στηλογραφία, as if "A Psalm to be hung up or inscribed on a pillar to
commemorate victory." It is, however, more likely still that the term
"Michtam" (like "Maschil"), is a musical term, whose real meaning and
use we have lost, and may recover only when the ransomed house of Israel
return home with songs. Meanwhile, the subject matter of this Psalm
itself is very clearly this - the righteous one's satisfaction with his
lot. - Andrew A. Bonar.

Whole Psalm

Allow that in verse ten it is clear that our Lord is in this Psalm, yet
the application of every verse to Jesus in Gethsemane appears to be far
fetched, and inaccurate. How verse nine could suit the agony and bloody
sweat, it is hard to conceive, and equally so is it with regard to verse
six. The "cup" of verse five is so direct a contrast to that cup
concerning which Jesus prayed in anguish of spirit, that it cannot be a
reference to it. Yet we think it right to add, that Mr. James Frame has
written a very valuable work on this Psalm, entitled, "Christ in
Gethsemane," and he has supported his theory by the opinion, of many of
the ancients. He says, "All the distinguished interpreters of ancient
days, such as Eusebius, Jerome, and Augustine, explain the Psalm as
referring to the Messiah, in his passion and his victory over death and
the grave, including his subsequent exaltation to the right hand of
God;" and in a foot note he gives the following quotations: Jerome. -
"The Psalm pertains to Christ, who speaks in it.... It is the voice of
our King, which he utters in the human nature that he had assumed, but
without detracting from his divine nature.... The Psalm pertains to his
passion." Augustine. - "Our King speaks in this Psalm in the person of
the human nature that he assumed, at the time of his passion, the royal
title inscribed will show itself conspicuous." - C. H. S.

Whole Psalm

The present Psalm is connected in thought and language with the
foregoing, and linked on to the following Psalm by catchwords. It is
entitled in the Syriac and Arabic versions, a Psalm on the Election of
the Church, and on the Resurrection of Christ." - Christopher
Wordsworth, D.D., 1868.

[Psa 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001.md)

"Preserve me, O God." Here David desireth not deliverance from any
special trouble, but generally prayeth to be fenced and defended
continually by the providence of God, wishing that the Lord would
continue his mercy towards him unto the end, and in the end; whereby he
foresaw it was as needful for him to be safe guarded by God, his
protection in the end, as at the time present; as also how he made no
less account of it in his prosperity than in adversity. So that the man
of God still feared his infirmity, and therefore acknowledgeth himself
ever to stand in need of God his help. And here is a sure and undoubted
mark of the child of God, when a man shall have as great a care to
continue and grow in well-doing, as to begin; and this paying for the
gift of final perseverance is a special note of the child of God. This
holy jealousy of the man of God made him so to desire to be preserved at
all times, in all estates, both in soul and body. - Richard Greenham,
1531-1591.

[Psa 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001.md)

"For in thee do I put my trust." Here the prophet setteth down the cause
why he prayeth to God: whereby he declareth, that none can truly call
upon God unless they believe. [Rom
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#014.md). "How shall they call on him in
whom they have not believed?" In regard whereof, as he prayeth to God to
be his Saviour, so he is fully assured that God will be his Saviour. If,
then, without faith we cannot truly call upon God, the men of this world
rather prate like parrots than pray like Christians, at what time they
utter these words; for that they trust not in God they declare both by
neglecting the lawful means, and also in using unlawful means. Some we
see trust in friends; some shoulder out, as they think, the cross with
their goods; some fence themselves with authority; others bathe and
baste themselves in pleasure to put the evil day far from them; others
make flesh their arm; and others make the wedge of gold their
confidence; and these men when they seek for help at the Lord, mean in
their hearts to find it in their friends, good authority and pleasure,
howsoever for fear, they dare not say this outwardly. Again, here we are
to observe under what shelter we may harbour ourselves in the showers of
adversity, even under the protection of the Almighty. And why? "Whoso
dwelleth in the secret of the Most High, shall abide in the shadow of
the Almighty." And here in effect is showed, that whosoever putteth his
trust in God shall be preserved; otherwise the prophet's reason here had
not been good. Besides, we see he pleadeth not by merit, but sueth by
faith, teaching us that if we come with like faith, we may obtain the
like deliverance. - Richard Greenham.

[Psa 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002.md)

"O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord." I wish I
could have heard what you said to yourself when these words were first
mentioned. I believe I could guess the language of some of you. When you
heard me repeat these words, "O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord,
Thou art my Lord," you thought, "I have never said anything to the Lord,
unless when I cried out, Depart from me, for I desire not the knowledge
of thy ways." Has not something like this passed in your minds? I will
try again. When I first mentioned the text, "Let me consider," you
secretly said, "I believe that I did once say to the Lord, Thou art my
Lord; but it was so long ago, that I had almost forgotten it; but I
suppose that it must have been at such a time when I was in trouble. I
had met with disappointments in the world; and then, perhaps, I cried,
Thou art my portion, O Lord. Or, perhaps, when I was under serious
impressions, in the hurry of my spirits, I might look up to God and say,
Thou art my Lord. But, whatever I could or did formerly say, I am
certain that I cannot say it at present." Have none of you thought in
this manner? I will hazard one conjecture more; and I doubt not but in
this case I shall guess rightly. When I repeated these words, "O my
soul, thou hast said unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord;" "So have I,"
thought one; "So have I," thought another; I have said it often, but I
said it with peculiar solemnity and pleasure, when, in an act of humble
devotion, I lately threw my ransomed, rescued, grateful soul at his
feet, and cried, "O Lord, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant; thou
hast loosed my bonds." The very recollection of it is pleasant; and I
shall now have an opportunity of renewing my vows, and hope to recover
something of the divine serenity and joy which I at that time
experienced." - Samuel Lavington' s Sermons, 1810.

[Psa 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002.md)

"Thou art my Lord." He acknowledgeth the Lord Jehovah; but he seeth him
not as it were then afar off, but drawing near unto him, he sweetly
embraceth him; which thing is proper unto faith, and to that particular
applying which we say to be in faith. - Robert Rollock, 1600.

[Psa 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002.md)

"My goodness extendeth not to thee." I think the words should be
understood of what the Messiah was doing for men. My goodness, טונהי
tobhathi, "my bounty" is not to thee. What I am doing can add nothing to
thy divinity; thou art not providing this astonishing sacrifice because
thou canst derive any excellence from it; but this bounty extends to the
saints - to all the spirits of just men made perfect, whose bodies are
still in the earth; and to the excellent, אדּיוי addirey, "the noble or
super-eminent ones," those who through faith and patience inherit the
promises. The saints and illustrious ones not only taste of my goodness,
but enjoy my salvation. Perhaps angels themselves may be intended; they
are not uninterested in the incarnation, passion, death, and
resurrection of our Lord. They desire to look into these things; and the
victories of the cross in the conversion of sinners cause joy among the
angels of God. - Adam Clarke.

[Psa 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002.md)

"My goodness extendeth not to thee;" "My well-doing extendeth not to
thee." Oh, what shall I render unto thee, my God, for all thy benefits
towards me? what shall I repay? Alas! I can do thee no good, for mine
imperfect goodness cannot pleasure thee who art most perfect and
goodness itself; my well-doing can do thee no good, my wickedness can do
thee no harm. I receive all good from thee, but no good can I return to
thee; wherefore I acknowledge thee to be most rich, and myself to be
most beggarly; so far off is it that thou standest in any need of me.
Wherefore I will join myself to thy people, that whatsoever I have they
may profit by it; and whatsoever they have I may profit by it, seeing
the things that I have received must be put out to loan, to gain some
comfort to others, Whatsoever others have, they have not for their own
private use, but that by them, as by pipes and conduits, they liberally
should be conveyed unto me also. Wherefore in this strain we are taught,
that if we be the children of God, we must join ourselves in a holy
league to his people, and by mutual participation of the gifts of God,
We must testify each to other, that we be of the number and communion of
saints; and this is an undoubted badge and cognizance of him that loveth
God, if he also loveth them that are begotten of God. Wherefore, if we
so profess ourselves to be of God and to worship him, then we must join
ourselves to the church of God which with us doth worship God. And this
must we do of necessity, for it is a branch of our belief that there is
a Communion of saints in the church; and if we believe that there is a
God, we must also believe that there is a remnant of people, unto whom
God revealeth himself, and communicateth his mercies, in whom we must
have all our delight, to whom we must communicate according to the
measure of grace unto every one of us. - Richard Greenham.

[Psa 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002.md)

"My goodness extendeth not to thee." Oh, how great is God's goodness to
you! He calls upon others for the same things, and conscience stands as
Pharaohs taskmasters, requiring the tale of bricks but not allowing
straw; it impels and presseth, but gives no enlargement of heart, and
buffets and wounds them for neglect: as the hard creditor that, taking
the poor debtor by the throat, saith, "Pay me that thou owest me," but
yields him no power to do it; thus God might deal with you also, for he
oweth not assistance to us; but we owe obedience to him. Remember, we
had power, and it is just to demand what we cannot do, because the
weakness that is in us is of ourselves we have impoverished ourselves.
Therefore, when in much mercy he puts forth his hand into the work with
thee, be very thankful. If the work be not done, he is no loser; if
done, and well done, he is no gainer. [Job
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#002.md); [Job
35:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#006.md). But the gain is all to thee;
all the good that comes by it is to thyself. - Joseph Symonds, 1639.

[Psa 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002) (last clause.md)

It is a greater glory to us that we are allowed to serve God, than it is
to him that we offer him that service. He is not rendered happy by us;
but we are made happy by him. He can do without such earthly servants;
but we cannot do without such a heavenly Master. - William Secker

[Psa 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002) (last clause.md)

There is nothing added to God he is so perfect, that no sin can hurt
him; and so righteous, that no righteousness can benefit him. O Lord, my
righteousness extendeth not to thee! thou hast no need of my
righteousness. [Act 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#024.md), [Act
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#025.md). God hath no need of anything. -
Richard Stock, 1641.

[Psa 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002.md)

As Christ is the head of man, so is God the head of Christ ([Co1
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#003).md); and as man is subject unto
Christ, so is Christ subject to God; not in regard of the divine nature,
wherein there is an equality, and consequently no dominion of
jurisdiction; nor only in his human nature, but in the economy of a
Redeemer, considered as one designed, and consenting to be incarnate,
and take our flesh; so that after this agreement God had a sovereign
right to dispose of him according to the articles consented to. In
regard of his undertaking and the advantage he was to bring to the elect
of God upon earth, he calls God by the solemn title of "his Lord." "O my
soul, thou hast said unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord: my goodness
extendeth not to thee; but to the saints that are in the earth." It
seems to be the speech of Christ in heaven, mentioning the saints of
earth as at a distance from him. I can add nothing to the glory of thy
majesty, but the whole fruit of my meditation and suffering will redound
to the saints on earth. - Stephen Charnock.

[Psa 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002.md), [Psa
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#003.md)

"My goodness extendeth not to thee; but to the saints." God's goodness
to us should make us merciful to others. It were strange indeed a soul
should come out of his tender bosom with a hard uncharitable heart. Some
children do not indeed take after their earthly parents, as Cicero's
son, who had nothing of his father but him name; but God's children all
partake of their heavenly Father's nature. Philosophy tells us, that
there is no reaction from the earth to the heavens; they indeed shed
their influences upon the lower world, which quicken and fructify it,
but the earth returns none back to make the sun shine the better. David
knew that his goodness extendeth not unto God, but this made him reach
it forth to his brethren. Indeed, God hath left his poor saints to
receive the rents we owe unto him for his mercies. An ingenuous guest,
though his friend will take nothing for his entertainment, yet, to show
his thankfulness, will give something to his servants. - William
Gurnall.

[Psa 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#003.md)

"But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom
is all my delight." - My brethren, look upon saintship as the greatest
excellency to love it. So did Christ. His eye was, "upon the excellent
ones in the earth; that is, upon the saints, who were excellent to him;
yea, also even when not saints, because God loved them. [Isa
43:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#004.md). It is strange to hear how men by
their speeches will undervalue a saint as such, if without some other
outward excellency. For whilst they acknowledge a man a saint, yet in
other respects, they will contemn him; "He is a holy man," they will
say, "but he is weak," etc. But is he a saint? And can there be any such
other imperfection or weakness found as shall lay him low in thy
thoughts in comparison: are other carnal men more excellent.? Hath not
Christ loved him, bought him, redeemed him? - Thomas Goodwin.

[Psa 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#003.md)

"But to the saints." I understand that a man then evinces affection
towards God, and towards those who love God, when his soul yearns after
them - when he obliges himself to love them by practically serving and
benefiting them - acting towards them as he would act towards God
himself were he to see him in need of his service, as David says he did.
- Juan de Valdes, 1550.

[Psa 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#003.md)

"The saints." The Papists could abide no saints but those which are in
heaven; which argueth that they live in a kingdom of darkness, and err,
not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God; for if they were but
meanly conversant in the Scriptures, in the holy epistles, they should
find almost in every epistle mention made of the saints who are
thereunto called in Jesus Christ, through whom they are sanctified by
the Holy Ghost. And mark, he calleth them "excellent." Some think rich
men to be excellent, some think learned men to be excellent, some count
men in authority so to be, but here we are taught that those men are
excellent who are sanctified by God's graces. - Richard Greenham.

[Psa 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#003.md)

By David's language, there were many singular saints in his day: "To the
saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my
delight." Was it so then, and should it not be so now? We know the New
Testament outshines the Old as much as the sun outshines the moon. If we
then live in a more glorious dispensation, should we not maintain a more
glorious conversation?...."The excellent." Were the sun to give no more
delight than a star, you could not believe he was the regent of the day;
were he to transmit no more heat than a glowworm, you would question his
being the source of elementary heat. Were God to do no more than a
creature, where would his Godhead be? Were a man to do no more than a
brute, where would his manhood be? Were not a saint to excel a sinner,
where would his sanctity be? - William Secker.

[Psa 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#003.md)

Ingo, an ancient king of the Draves, who making a stately feast,
appointed his nobles, at that time Pagans, to sit in the hall below, and
commanded certain poor Christians to be brought up into his
presence-chamber, to sit with him at his table, to eat and drink of his
kingly cheer, at which many wondering, he said, he accounted Christians,
though never so poor, a greater ornament to his table, and more worthy
of his company than the greatest peers unconverted to the Christian
faith; for when these might be thrust down to hell, those might be his
comforts and fellow princes in heaven. Although you see the stars
sometimes by their reflections in a puddle, in the bottom of a well, or
in a stinking ditch, yet the stars have their situation in heaven. So,
although you see a godly man in a poor, miserable, low, despised
condition, for the things of this world, yet he is fixed in heaven, in
the region of heaven: "Who hath raised us up," saith the apostle, "and
made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus." - Charles
Bradbury's "Cabinet of Jewels," 1785.

[Psa 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#003.md)

To sum up all, we must know that we neither do nor can love the godly so
well as we should do; but all is well if we would love them better, and
do like ourselves the less because we do love them no more, and that
this is common or usual with me, then I am right: so that we are to love
the godly first because God commands it, because they are good; and in
these cases our faith doth work by our love to good men. Next, when I am
at the worst, like a sick sheep, I care not for the company of other
sheep, but do mope in a corner by myself; but yet I do not delight in
the society of goats or dogs, it proves that I have some good blood left
in me; it is because for the present I take little or no delight in
myself or in my God, that I delight no better in the godly yet as I love
myself for all that, so I may be said to love them for all this. Man
indeed is a sociable creature, a company-keeper by nature when he is
himself; and if we do not associate ourselves with the ungodly, though
for the present, and care not much to show ourselves amongst the godly,
the matter is not much, it is a sin of infirmity, not a fruit of
iniquity. The disciples went from Christ, but they turned not to the
other side as Judas did, who did forsake his Master and joined himself
to his Master's enemies, but they got together. Some say Demas did
repent (which I think to be the truth), and then he did "embrace this
present world," but for the present fit: put case he did forsake Paul;
so did better men than he. Indeed as long as a man hath his delights
about him, he will embrace the delights of this present world, or the
delights which belong to the world to come; join with Paul, or cleave to
the world. In this temptation our stay is, first, that we care not for
the company of goats; next, that as we should, so we would, and desire
that we may take delight in the company of sheep, to count them the only
excellent men in the world, in whom is all our delight. The conclusion
is, that to love the saints as saints, is a sound proof of faith; the
reason is, for that we cannot master our affections by love, but first
we must master our understandings by faith. - Richard Capel, 1586-1656.

[Psa 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#004.md)

"Drink offerings of blood." The Gentiles used to offer, and some times
to drink part of the blood of the sacrifices, whether of beasts or of
men, as either of them were sacrificed. - Matthew Poole.

[Psa 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#004.md)

Drink offerings of blood." It is uncertain whether this expression is to
be understood literally to be blood, which the heathen actually mixed in
their libations when they bound themselves to the commission of some
dreadful deed, or whether their libations are figuratively called
offerings of blood to denote the horror with which the writer regarded
them. - George R. Noyes, in loc, 1846.

[Psa 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#004) (last clause.md)

A sin rolled under the tongue becomes soft and supple, and the throat is
so short and slippery a passage, that insensibly it may slide down from
the mouth into the stomach; and contemplative wantonness quickly turns
into practical uncleanness. - Thomas Fuller.

[Psa 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005.md)

"The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance." If the Lord be thy
portion, then thou mayst conclude omnipotency is my portion, immensity,
all-sufficiency, etc. Say not, If so, then I should be omnipotent, etc.
There is a vast difference betwixt identity and interest, betwixt
conveying of a title and transmutation of nature. A friend gives thee an
invaluable treasure, and all the securities of it that thou canst
desire; wilt thou deny it is thine because thou art not changed into its
nature? The attributes are thine, as thy inheritance, as thy lands are
thine; not because thou art changed into their nature, but because the
title is conveyed to thee, it is given thee, and improved for thy
benefit. If another manage it, who can do it with greater advantage to
thee than thou to thyself, it is no infringement of thy title.... The
Lord is our portion, and this is incomparably more than if we had heaven
and earth; for all the earth is but as a point compared with the
vastness of the heavens, and the heavens themselves are but a point
compared with God. What a large possession have we then! There is no
confiscation of it, no banishment from it. Our portion fills heaven and
earth, and is infinitely above heaven and below earth, and beyond both.
Poor men boast and pride themselves of a kingdom, but we have more than
all the kingdoms of the world and the glory thereof. Christ has given us
more than the devil could offer him. - David Clarkson.

[Psa 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005.md)

"Portion of mine inheritance and of my cup," may contain an allusion to
the daily supply of food, and also to the inheritance of Levi. [Deu
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#001.md), [Deu
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#002.md) "Critical and Explanatory Pocket
Bible." By A. R. Fausset and B. M. Smith, 1867.

"The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance: the lines are fallen unto
me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage." "Blessed are the
people that are in such a case; yea, blessed are the people whose God is
the Lord." No greater mercy can be bestowed upon any people, family, or
person, than this, for God to dwell among them. If we value this mercy
according to the excellency and worth of that which is bestowed, it is
the greatest; if we value it according to the good will of him that
gives it, it will appear likewise to be the greatest favour. The
greatness of the good will of God in giving himself to be our
acquaintance, is evident in the nature of the gift. A man may give his
estate to them to whom his love is not very large, but he never gives
himself but upon strong affection. God gives abundantly to all the works
of his hands; he causeth the sun to shine upon the evil and upon the
good, and the rain to descend upon the just and the unjust; but it
cannot be conceived that he should give himself to be a portion, a
friend, father, husband, but in abundance of love. Whosoever therefore
shall refuse acquaintance with God, slighteth the greatest favour that
ever God did bestow upon man. Now, consider what a high charge this is;
to abuse such a kindness from God is an act of the greatest vileness.
David was never so provoked as when the king of Ammon abused his
kindness, in his ambassadors, after his father's death. And God is
highly provoked when his greatest mercies, bestowed in the greatest
love, are rejected and cast away. What could God give more and better
than himself?.... Ask David what he thinks of God; he was well
acquainted with him, he dwelt in his house, and by his good will would
never be out of his more immediate presence and company: enquire, I
pray, what he found amiss in him. That you may know his mind the better,
he hath left it upon record in more than one or two places, what a
friend he hath had of God. "The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant
places; yea, I have a goodly heritage." Why, what is that you boast of
so much, O David? Have not others had kingdoms as well as you? No,
that's not the thing; a crown is one of the least jewels in my cabinet.
The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup." - James
Janeway.

[Psa 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005.md), [Psa
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#006.md)

Take notice not only of the mercies of God, but of God in the mercies.
Mercies are never so savoury as when they savour of a Saviour. - Ralph
Venning, 1620-1673.

[Psa 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#006.md)

"The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly
heritage." Bitter herbs will go down very well, when a man has such
delicious "meats which the world knows not of." The sense of our
Father's love is like honey at the end of every rod; it turns stones
into bread, and water into wine, and the valley of trouble into a door
of hope; it makes the biggest evils seem as if they were none, or better
than none; for it makes our deserts like the garden of the Lord, and
when we are upon the cross for Christ, as if we were in paradise with
Christ. Who would quit his duty for the sake of suffering, that hath
such relief under it? Who would not rather walk in truth, when he hath
such a cordial to support him, than by the conduct of fleshly wisdom, to
take any indirect or irregular method for his own deliverance? - Timothy
Gruso.

[Psa 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#006.md)

"The lines." Probably alluding to the division of the land by lot, and
the measuring of it off by ropes and lines. David believed in an
overruling destiny which fixed the bounds of his abode, and his
possessions; he did more, he was satisfied with all the appointment of
the predestinating God. - C. H. S.

[Psa 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#007.md)

"I will bless the Lord, who hath given me counsel." The Holy Ghost is a
spirit of counsel, powerfully instructing and convincingly teaching how
to act and walk, for he directs us to set right steps, and to walk with
a right foot, and thereby prevents us of many a sin, by seasonable
instruction set on upon our hearts with a strong hand; as [Isa
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#011.md). For, as the same prophet says
([Isa 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002).md), he is the spirit of
counsel and of might. Of counsel to direct; of might, to strengthen the
inner man. Such he was to Christ the Head, of whom it is there spoken.
For instance, in that agony (on the determination of which our salvation
depended), and conflict in the garden, when he prayed, "Let this cup
pass," it was this good Spirit that counselled him to die; and he
blesseth God for it. "I bless the Lord that hath given me counsel." It
was that counsel that in that case caused his heart to say, "Not my
will, but thine." - Thomas Goodwin.

[Psa 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#007.md)

"My reins." Common experience shows that the workings of the mind,
particularly the passions of joy, grief, and fear, have a very
remarkable effect on the reins or kidneys, and from their retired
situation in the body, and their being hid in fat, they are often used
in Scripture to denote the most secret working of the soul and
affections. - John Parkhurst.

[Psa 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#007.md)

"My reins also instruct me in the night seasons." This shows that God,
who, he says, was always present to him, had give him some admonition in
his dreams, or at least his waking thoughts by night, from whence he
gathered a certain assurance of his recovery; possibly he might be
directed to some remedy. Antonine thanks the gods for directing him in
his sleep to remedies. - Z. Mudge, in loc, 1744.

[Psa 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#007.md)

"My reins also instruct me in the night seasons." We have a saying among
ourselves that "the pillow is the best counsellor;" and there is much
truth in the saying, especially if we have first committed ourselves in
prayer to God, and taken a prayerful spirit with us to our bed. In the
quiet of its silent hours, undisturbed by the passions, and unharassed
by the conflicts of the world, we can commune with our own heart, and be
instructed and guarded as to our future course even "in the night
season." David especially seems to have made these seasons sources of
great profit as well as delight. Sometimes he loved to meditate upon God
as he lay upon his bed; and it was no doubt as he meditated on the
Lord's goodness and on the way by which he had led him, that he was, as
it were, constrained, even at midnight, to arise and pray. While,
therefore, we acknowledge the pillow to be a good counsellor, let us
with David here acknowledge also that it is the Lord who gives the
counsel, and sends the instruction in the night season. - Barton
Bouchier.

[Psa 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#008.md)

"I have set the Lord always before me." David did not by fits and starts
set the Lord before him; but he "always" set the Lord before him in his
course; he had his eye upon the Lord, and so much the Hebrew word
imports: I have equally set the Lord before me; that is the force of the
original word, that is, I have set the Lord before me, at one time as
well as another, without any irregular affections or passions, etc. In
every place, in every condition, in every company, in every employment,
and in every enjoyment, I have set the Lord equally before me; and this
raised him, and this will raise any Christian, by degrees, to a very
great height of holiness. - Thomas Brooks.

[Psa 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#008.md)

"I have set the Lord always before me." Hebrew, I have equally set, or
proposed. The apostle translateth it, "I foresaw the Lord always before
my face." [Act 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#025.md). I set the eye of
my faith full upon him, and suffer it not to take to other things; I
look him in the face, oculo irretorto, as the eagle looketh upon the
sun; and oculo adamantino, with an eye of adamant, which turns only to
one point: so here I have equally set the Lord before me, without
irregular affections and passions. And this was one of those lessons
that his reins had taught him, that the Holy Spirit had dictated unto
him. - John Trapp.

[Psa 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#008.md)

"I have set the Lord always before me." Like as the gnomon doth ever
behold the north star, whether it be closed and shut up in a coffer of
gold, silver, or wood, never losing its nature; so a faithful Christian
man, whether he abound in wealth or be pinched with poverty, whether he
be of high or low degree in this world, ought continually to have his
faith and hope surely built and grounded upon Christ, and to have his
heart and mind fast fixed and settled in him, and to follow him through
thick and thin, through fire and water, through wars and peace, through
hunger and cold,: through friends and foes, through a thousand perils
and dangers, through the surges and waves of envy, malice, hatred, evil
speeches, railing sentences, contempt of the world, flesh, and devil,
and even in death itself, be it never so bitter, cruel, and tyrannical,
yet never to lose sight and view of Christ, never to give over faith,
hope, and trust in him. - Robert Cawdray.

[Psa 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#008.md)

"I have set the Lord always before me." By often thinking of God, the
heart will be enticed into desires after him. [Isa
26:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#008.md). "The desire of our soul is to
thy name, and to the remembrance of thee;" and see what follows, [Isa
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#009.md) : "With my soul have I desired
thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee
early." Love sets the soul on musing, and from musing to praying.
Meditation is prayer in bullion, prayer in the ore - soon melted and run
into holy desires. The laden cloud soon drops into rain; the piece
charged soon goes off when fire is put to it. A meditating soul is in
proxima potentia to prayer. - William Gurnall.

[Psa 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#008.md)

"I have set the Lord always before me," etc. He that by faith eyes God
continually as his protector in trouble "shall not be moved" with any
evil that he suffers, and he that eyes God by faith as his pattern in
holiness, shall not be moved from doing that which is good. This thought
- the Lord is at our right hand - keeps us from turning either to the
right hand or to the left. It is said of Enoch, that "he walked with
God" ([Gen 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#022).md), and though the
history of his life be very short, yet 'tis said of him a second time
([Gen 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#024).md), that "he walked with
God." He walked so much with God that he walked as God: he did not
"walk" (which kind of walking the apostle reproves, [Co1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#003).md), "as men." He walked so little
like the world that his stay was little in the world. "He was not,"
saith the text, "for God took him." He took him from the world to
himself, or, as the author to the Hebrews reports it, "he was translated
that he should not see death, for he had this testimony, that he pleased
God." - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#008.md)

"Because he is at my right hand," etc. Of ourselves we stand not at any
time, by his power we may overcome at all times. And when we are sorest
assaulted he is ever ready at our right hand to support and stay us that
we shall not fall. He hath well begun, and shall happily go forward in
his work, who hath in truth begun. For true grace well planted in the
heart, how weak, soever, shall hold out for ever. All total decays come
from this - that the heart was never truly mollified, nor grace deeply
and kindly rooted therein. - John Ball.

[Psa 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#008.md)

"He is at my right hand." This phrase of speech is borrowed from those
who, when they take upon them the patronage, defence, or tuition of any,
will set them on their right hand, as in place of most safeguard.
Experience confirmeth this in children, who in any imminent danger
shroud and shelter themselves under their father's arms or hands, as
under a sufficient buckler. Such was the estate of the man of God, as
here appeareth, who was hemmed and edged in with the power of God, both
against present evils, and dangers to come. - Richard Greenham

[Psa 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#008.md)

Even as a column or pillar is sometimes on thy right hand, and sometimes
on thy left hand, because thou dost change thy standing, sitting, or
walking, for it is unmovable and keepeth one place; so God is sometimes
favourable and bountiful unto thee, and sometimes seemeth to be wroth
and angry with thee, because thou dost fall from virtue to vice, from
obedience and humility to pride and presumption; for in the Lord there
is no change, no, not so much as any shadow of change. He is immutable,
always one and everlasting. If thou wilt bend thyself to obedience, and
to a virtuous and godly life, thou shalt ever have him a strong rock,
whereupon thou mayst boldly build a castle and tower of defence. He will
be unto thee a mighty pillar, bearing up heaven and earth, whereto thou
mayst lean and not be deceived, wherein thou mayst trust and not be
disappointed. He will ever be at thy right hand, that thou shalt not
fall. He will take thy part, and will mightily defend thee against all
enemies of thy body and of thy soul; but if thou wilt shake hands with
virtue, and bid it adieu, and farewell, and, forsaking the ways of God,
wilt live as thou list, and follow thy own corruption, and make no
conscience of aught thou doest, defiling and blemishing thyself with all
manner of sin and iniquity, then be sure the Lord will appear unto thee
in his fury and indignation. From his justice and judgments none shall
ever be able to deliver thee. - Robert Cawdray.

[Psa 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#009.md)

"My heart is glad." Men may for a time be hearers of the gospel, men may
for order's sake pray, sing, receive the sacraments; but if it be
without joy, will not that hyprocrisy in time break out? Will they not
begin to be weary? Nay will they not be as ready to hear any other
doctrine? Good things cannot long find entertainment in our corruptions,
unless the Holy Ghost hath changed us from our old delights to conceive
pleasure in these things. - Richard Greenham.

[Psa 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#009.md)

"My heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth." His inward joy was not able
to contain itself. We testify our pleasure on lower occasions, even at
the gratification of our senses; when our ear is filled with harmonious
melody, when our eye is fixed upon admirable and beauteous objects, when
our smell is recreated with agreeable odours, and our taste also by the
delicacy and rareness of provisions; and much more will our soul show
its delight, when its faculties, that are of a more exquisite
constitution, meet with things that are in all respects agreeable and
pleasant to them; and in God they meet with all those: with his light
our understanding is refreshed, and so is our will with his goodness and
his love. - Timothy Rogers.

[Psa 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#009.md)

"Therefore my heart is glad," etc. That is, I am all over in very good
plight, as well as heart can wish, or require; I do over-abound
exceedingly with joy; "God forgive me mine unthankfulness and
unworthiness of so great glory" (as that martyr said): "In all the days
of my life I was never so merry as now I am in this dark dungeon," etc.
Wicked men rejoice in appearance, and not in heart ([Co2
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#012).md); their joy is but skin deep,
their mirth frothy and flashy, such as wetteth the mouth, but warmeth
not the heart. But David is totus totus, quantus quantus exultabundus;
his heart, glory, flesh, (answerable, as some think to that of the
apostle, [Th1 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023.md); spirit, soul, and
body)were all overjoyed. - John Trapp.

[Psa 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#009.md)

"My flesh shall rest in hope." If a Jew pawned his bed-clothes, God
provided mercifully that it should be restored before night: "For,"
saith he, "that is his covering; wherein shall he sleep?" [Exo
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#027.md). Truly, hope is the saint's
covering, wherein he wraps himself, when he lays his body down to sleep
in the grave: "My flesh," saith David, "shall rest in hope." O
Christian, bestir thyself to redeem thy hope before this sun of thy
temporal life goes down upon thee, or else thou art sure to lie down in
sorrow. A sad going to the bed of the grave he hath who hath no hope of
a resurrection to life. - William Gurnall.

[Psa 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#009.md)

"My flesh shall rest in hope." That hope which is grounded on the word,
gives rest to the soul; 'tis an anchor to keep it steady. [Heb
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#013.md). Which shows the unmovableness of
that which our anchor is fastened to. The promise sustains our faith,
and our faith is that which supports us. He that hopes in the Word as
David did ([Psa 119:81](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#081).md), lays a mighty
stress upon it; as Samson did when he leaned upon the pillars of the
house, so as to pull it down upon the Philistines. A believer throws the
whole weight of all his affairs and concernments, temporal, spiritual,
and eternal, upon the promises of God, like a man resolved to stand or
fall with them. He ventures himself, and all that belongs to him,
entirely upon this bottom, which is in effect to say, if they will not
bear me up, I am content to sink; I know that there shall be a
performance of those things which have been told me from the Lord, and
therefore I will incessantly look for it. - Timothy Cruso.

[Psa 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010.md)

"For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell," etc. The title of this golden
text may be - The embalming of the dead saints: the force whereof is to
free the souls from dereliction in the state of death, and to secure the
bodies of God's saints from corruption in the grave. It is the art which
I desire to learn, and at this time, teach upon this sad occasion, even
the preparing of this confection against our burials. - George Hughes,
1642.

[Psa 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010.md)

Many of the elder Reformers held that our Lord in soul actually
descended into hell, according to some of them to suffer there as our
surety, and according to others to make a public triumph over death and
hell. This idea was almost universally, and, as we believe, most
properly repudiated by the Puritans. To prove this fact, it may be well
to quote from Corbet's witty itinerary of,

"Foure clerkes of Oxford, doctors two, and two

That would be docters."

He laments the secularisation of church appurtenances at Banbury, by the
Puritans whom he describes as,

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ "They which tell

That Christ hath nere descended into hell,

But to the grave."

C. H. S. The quotation is from Richard Corbet's Poems, 1632.

[Psa 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010.md)

"My soul in hell." Christ in soul descended into hell, when as our
surety he submitted himself to bear those hellish sorrows (or equivalent
to them), which we were bound by our sins to suffer for ever. His
descension is his projection of himself into the sea of God's wrath
conceived for our sins, and his ingression into most unspeakable straits
and torments in his soul, which we should else have suffered for ever in
hell. This way of Christ's descending into hell is expressly uttered in
the person of David, as the type of Christ. [Psa
86:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#013.md); [Psa
116:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#003.md); [Psa
69:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#001.md). Thus the prophet Isaiah saith,
"His soul was made an offering." [Isa
53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010.md). And this I take it David means,
when he said of Christ, "Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell." [Psa
16:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001.md); Acts 2. And thus Christ
descended into hell when he was alive, not when he was dead. Thus his
soul was in hell when in the garden he did sweat blood, and on the cross
when he cried so lamentably, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken
me?" [Mat 26:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#038.md). - Nicholas Byfield's
"Exposition of the Creed," 1676.

[Psa 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010.md)

"In hell." Sheol here, as hades in the New Testament, signifies the
state of the dead, the separate state of souls after death, the
invisible world of souls, where Christ's soul was, though it did not
remain there, but on the third day returned to its body again. It seems
best of all to interpret this word of the grave as it is rendered; [Gen
42:38](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#038.md); [Isa
38:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#018.md). - John Gill.

[Psa 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010.md)

"Thine Holy One." Holiness preserves the soul from dereliction, in the
state of death, and the body of the saint from corruption in the grave.
If it be desired by any that doubt of it, to see the clear issue of this
from the text, I shall guide them to read this text with a great accent
upon that term, "Thine Holy One," that they may take special notice of
it, even the quality of that man exempted from these evils. In this the
Spirit of God puts an emphasis upon holiness, as counter-working and
prevailing over death and the grave. It is this and nothing but this,
that thus keeps the man, dead and buried, from desertion in death, and
corruption in the grave. - George Hughes.

[Psa 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010.md)

The great promise to Christ is, that though he took a corruptible body
upon him, yet he should "not see corruption," that is, partake of
corruption, corruption should have no communion with, much less power
over him. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010.md)

Quoted by the apostle Peter ([Act
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#027)); on which Hackett (Com in loc..md)
observes: - "The sense then may be expressed thus: Thou wilt not give me
up as a prey to death; he shall not have power over me, to dissolve the
body and cause it to return to dust."

[Psa 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011.md)

In this verse are four things observable: - 1. A Guide, Thou. 2. A
Traveller, Me. 3. A Way, the Path. 4. The End, Life., described after.
For that which follows is but the description of this life.

This verse is a proper subject for a meditation. For, all three are
solitary. The guide is but one; the traveller, one; the way, one; and
the life, the only one. To meditate well on this is to bring all
together; and at last make them all but one. Which that we may do, let
us first seek our Guide.

The Guide. Him we find named in the first verse - Jehovah. Here we may
begin, as we ought in all holy exercises, with adoration. For, "unto him
all knees shall bow;" nay, unto his name. For holy is his name. Glory be
to thee, O God! He is Deus, therefore holy; he is Deus fortis, therefore
able. "For the strength of the hills is his;" and if there be a way on
earth, he can "show" it; for in his hands are all the comers of the
earth. But is he willing to "show"? Yes, though he be Deus, holy (which
is a word terrible to poor flesh and blood), yet he is Deus meus, my
holiness. That takes away servile fear. He is meus, we have a property
in him; and he is willing: "Thou wilt show," etc. And that you may know
he will guide, David shows a little above how diligently he will guide.
First, he will go before, he will lead the way himself: if I can but
follow, I shall be sure to go right. And he that hath a guide before
him, and will not follow, is worthy to be left behind. But say, I am
willing, I do desire to go, and I do follow: what if, through faintness
in the long way, I fall often? or, for want of care step out of the way,
shall I not then be left behind? Fear not; for "He is at my right hand,
so that I shall not slip." [Psa 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#008.md).
This is some comfort indeed. But we are so soon weary in this way, and
do fall and err so often, that it would weary the patience of a good
guide to lead us but one day. Will he bear with us, and continue to the
end? Yes, always; or this text deceives us; for all this is found in the
eighth verse. We must have him or none; for he is one, and the only one.
So confessed Asaph: "Whom have I on earth but thee?" Seek this good
Guide, he is easy to be found: "Seek, and ye shall find." You shall find
that he is first holy; secondly, able; thirdly, willing; fourthly,
diligent; and fifthly, constant. O my soul! to follow him, and he will
make thee both able to follow to the end; and holy in the end.

The traveller. Having found the Guide, we shall not long seek for one
that wants him; for, see, here is a man out of his way. And that will
soon appear if we consider his condition. For, he is a stranger ("Thou
wilt show me"); and what am I? "I am a stranger, and a sojourner, as all
my fathers were," says he, in another place. But this was in the old
time under the law; what, are we, their sons, in the gospel, any other?
Peter tells us no: that we are strangers and pilgrims too; that is,
travellers. We travel, as being out of our country; and we are strangers
to those we converse with. For neither the natives be our friends, nor
anything we possess truly our own. It is time we had anirnum revertendi;
and surely so we have if we could but pray on the way. Converte nos
Dornine. But it is so long since we came hither, we have forgot the way
home: obliti sunt montis mei. Yet still we are in te. But right, like
pilgrims, or rather, wanderers. For we scarce know if we go right; and,
which is worse, have little care to enquire.

"Me." David still keeps the singular number. As there is but one guide,
so he speaks in the person but of one traveller. There is somewhat,
peradventure, in that. It is to show his confidence. The Lord's prayer
is in the plural, but the creed in the singular. We may pray that God
would guide all; but we can be confident for none but ourselves. "Thou
wilt show," or thou dost, or hast, as some translate: all is but to show
particular confidence. "Thou wilt show me;" me, not us, a number
indefinite wherein I may be one; but me in particular that am out of the
way; that am myself alone; that must walk in "the path" alone. Either I
must follow, or go before others; I must work for myself alone; believe
for myself alone; and be saved by one alone. The way in this text that I
must walk is but one; nay, it is but a "path" where but one can go: this
is no highway, but a way of sufferance by favour: it is none of ours. It
is no road; you cannot hurry here, or gallop by troops: it is but
semita, a small footpath for one to go alone in. Nay, as it is a way for
one alone, so it is a lonely way: preparate vias ejus in solitudine,
saith John, and he knew which way God went, who is our Guide in
solitudine: there is the sweetness of solitariness, the comforts of
meditation. For God is never more familiar with man than when man is in
solitudine, alone, in his path by himself. Christ himself came thus, all
lonely; without troop, or noise, and ever avoided the tumultuous
multitude, though they would have made him a king. And he never spake to
them but in parables; but to his that sought him, in solitudine, in
private, he spake plain; and so doth he still love to do to the soul, in
private and particular. Therefore well said David, "Thou wilt show me,"
in particular, and in the singular number. But how shall I know that I,
in particular, shall be taught and showed this way? This prophet, that
had experience, will tell us: mites docebit, the humble he will teach.
[Psa 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#009.md). If thou canst humble
thyself, thou mayst be sure to see thy guide; Christ hath crowned this
virtue with a blessing: "Blessed are the meek;" for them he will call to
him and teach. But thou must be humble then. For heaven is built like
our churches, high-roofed within, but with a strait low gate; they then
that enter there must stoop, ere they can see God. Humility is the mark
at every cross, whereby thou shalt know if thou be in the way: if any be
otherwise minded, God also shall reveal it unto you, for, "Thou wilt
show."

"The path." But let us now see what he will show us: "the path." We must
know, that as men have many paths out of their highway - the world - but
they all end in destruction; so God hath many paths out of his highway,
the word, but they all end in salvation. Let us oppose ours to his (as
indeed they are opposite), and see how they agree. Ours are not worth
marking, his marked with an attendire, to begin withal; ours bloody, his
unpolluted; ours crooked, his straight; ours lead to hell, his to
heaven. Have not we strayed then? We had need to turn and take another
path, and that quickly-we may well say, semitas nostras, vi tu. Well,
here is the Book, and here are the ways before you; and he will show
you. Here is semita mandatorum, in the one hundred-and-nineteenth Psalm,
verse thirty-five; here is semita pacifica ([Pro
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#017).md); here is semita aequitatis ([Pro
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#011).md); here is semita justitae ([Psa
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#003).md); here is semita judicii ([Pro
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#023).md); and many others. These are,
every one of them, God's ways; but these are somewhat too many and too
far off we must seek the way where all these meet, and that will bring
us into "the path;" these are many, but I will show you yet "a more
excellent way," saith Paul. [Co1
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#031.md).

We must begin to enter at via mandatorum; for till then we are in the
dark and can distinguish no ways, whether they be good or bad. But there
we shall meet with a,lantern and a light in it. Thy commandment is a
lantern, and the law a light. [Pro
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#023.md). Carry this with thee (as a good
man should, lex Dei in curde ejus); and it will bring thee into the way.
And see how careful our Guide is; for lest the wind should blow out this
light, he hath put it into a lantern to preserve it. For the fear, or
sanction, of the "commandments," preserves the memory of the law in our
hearts, as a lantern doth a light burning within it. The law is the
light, and the commandment the lantern. So that neither flattering
Zephyrus, nor blustering Boreas shall be able to blow it out, so long as
the fear of the sanction keeps it in. This is lucerna pedibus ([Psa
119:105](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#105).md); and will not only show thee
where thou shalt tread, but what pace thou shalt keep. When thou hast
this light, take Jeremy's counsel; enquire for semita antiqua, before
thou goest any further. "Stand (saith he) in the ways and behold and ask
for the old way; which is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall
find rest for your souls." This will bring you some whither where you
may rest awhile. And whither is that? Trace this path, and you shall
find this "old way" to run quite through all the Old Testament till it
end in the New, the gospel of peace, and there is rest. And that this is
so Paul affirms. For the law, which is the "old way," is but the
pedagogue to the gospel. This then is "a more excellent way" than the
law, the ceremonies whereof in respect of this were called "beggarly
rudiments." When we come there, we shall find the way pleasant and very
light, so that we shall plainly see before us that very path, that only
path, "the path of life" (semita vitae), in which the gospel ends, as
the law ends in the gospel. Now what is semita vitae that we seek for?
"All the ways of God are truth," saith David. [Psa
119:151](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#151.md). He doth not say they are
verse, or veritates, but veritas; all one truth. So, all the ways of God
end in one truth. Semita vitae, then, is truth. And so sure a way to
life is truth, that John says, he had "no greater joy" than to hear that
his sons "walked in truth." [Jo3 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#003.md).
"No greater joy:" for it brings them certainly to a joy, than which
there is none greater. Via veritatis is "the gospel of truth." but
semita vitae is the truth itself. Of these, Esay prophesied, et erit ibi
semita et via, etc. "There shall be a path, and away;" and the way shall
be called holy, the proper epithet of the gospel: "the holy gospel,"
that is the way. But the path is the epitome of this way (called in our
text, by way of excellence, "the path," in the singular); than which
there is no other. "The gospel of your salvation," saith Paul, is "the
word of truth;" and "thy word is truth," saith our Saviour to his
Father. Truth, then, is "the path of life," for it is the epitome of the
gospel, which is the way. This is that truth which Pilate (unhappy man)
asked after, but never stayed to be resolved of. He himself is the word;
the word is the truth; and the truth is "the path of life," trodden by
all the patriarchs, prophets, apostles, martyrs and confessors, that
ever went to heaven before us. The abstract of the gospel, the gate of
heaven, semita vitae, "the path of life," even Jesus Christ the
righteous, who hath beaten the way for us, gone himself before us, and
left us the prints of his footsteps for us to follow, where he himself
sits ready to receive us. So, the law is the light, the gospel is the
way, and Christ is "the path of life." - William Austin, 1637.

[Psa 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011.md)

It is Christ's triumphing in the consideration of his exaltation, and
taking pleasure in the fruits of his sufferings: "Thou wilt show me the
paths of life." God hath now opened the way to paradise, which was
stopped up by a flaming sword, and made the path plain by admitting into
heaven the head of the believing world. This is part of the joy of the
soul of Christ; he hath now a fulness of joy, a satisfying delight
instead of an overwhelming sorrow; a "fulness of joy," not only some
sparks and drops as he had now and then in his debased condition; and
that in the presence of his Father. His soul is fed and nourished with a
perpetual vision of God, in whose face he beholds no more frowns, no
more designs of treating him as a servant, but such smiles that shall
give a perpetual succession of joy to him, and fill his soul with fresh
and pure flames. Pleasures they are, pleasantness in comparison whereof
the greatest joys in this life are anguish and horrors. His soul hath
joys without mixture, pleasures without number, a fulness without want,
a constancy without interruption, and a perpetuity without end. -
Stephen Charnock.

[Psa 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011.md)

"In thy presence," etc. To the blessed soul resting in Abraham's bosom,
there shall be given an immortal, impassible, resplendent, perfect, and
glorious body. Oh, what a happy meeting will this be, what a sweet
greeting between the soul, and body, the nearest and dearest
acquaintance that ever were! What a welcome will that soul give to her
beloved body! Blessed be thou (will she say), for thou hast aided me to
the glory I have enjoyed since I parted with thee; blessed art thou that
sufferedst thyself to be mortified, giving "thy members as weapons of
righteousness unto God." [Rom 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#013.md).
Cheer up thyself, for now the time of labour is past, and the time of
rest is come. Thou wast sown and buried in the dust of earth with
ignominy, but now raised in glory; sown in weakness, but raised in
power; sown a natural body, but raised a spiritual body; sown in
corruption, but raised in incorruption. [Co1
15:43](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#043.md). O my dear companion and
familiar, we took sweet counsel together, we two have walked together as
friends in God's house ([Psa 55:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#014).md),
for when I prayed inwardly, thou didst attend my devotions with bowed
knees and lifted-up hands outwardly. We two have been fellow labourers
in the works of the Lord, we two have suffered together, and now we two
shall ever reign together; I will enter again into thee, and so both of
us together will enter into our Master's joy, where we shall have
pleasures at his right hand for evermore.

The saints, entered as it were into the chamber of God's presence, shall
have joy to their ears in hearing their own commendating and praise,
"Well done, good and faithful servant" ([Mat
25:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#021).md); and in hearing the divine
language of heavenly Canaan; for our bodies shall be vera et viva,
perfect like Christ's glorious body, who did both hear other and speak
himself after his resurrection, as it is apparent in the gospels'
history. Now, then, if the words of the wise spoken in due places be
like" apples of gold with pictures of silver" ([Pro
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#011).md), if the mellifluous speech of
Origen, the silver trumpet of Hillary, the golden mouth of Chrysostom,
bewitched as it were their auditory with exceeding great delight; if the
gracious eloquence of heathen orators, whose tongues were never touched
with a coal from God's altar, could steal away the hearts of their
hearers, and carry them up and down whither they would, what a "fullness
of joy" will it be to hear not only the sanctified, but also the
glorified tongues of saints and angels in the kingdom of glory?...
Bonaventure fondly reports at all adventure, that St. Francis hearing an
angel a little while playing on a harp, was so moved with extraordinary
delight, that he thought himself in another world. Oh! what a "fulness
of joy" will it be to hear more than twelve legions of angels,
accompanied with a number of happy saints which no man is able to
number, all at once sing together, "Hallelujah, holy, holy, holy, Lord
God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come." "And every creature
which is in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth, and such as are
in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and
honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne,
and unto the Lamb for ever and ever." [Rev
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#008.md); [Rev
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#013.md). If the voices of mortal men, and
the sound of cornet, trumpet, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and
other well-tuned instruments of music, passing through our dull ears in
this world be so powerful, that all our affections are diversely
transported according to the divers kinds of harmony, then how shall we
be ravished in God's presence when we shall hear heavenly airs with
heavenly ears!

Concerning "fulness of joy" to the rest of the senses I find a very
little or nothing in holy Scriptures, and therefore seeing God's Spirit
will not have a pen to write, I may not have a tongue to speak. Divines
in general affirm, that the smelling, and taste, and feeling, shall have
joy proportionable to their blessed estate, for this corruptible must
put on incorruption, and this mortal immortality; the body which is sown
in weakness is to be raised in power; it is sown a natural body, but it
is raised a spiritual body, buried in dishonour, raised in glory; that
is, capable of good, and, as being impassible, no way subject to suffer
evil, insomuch that it cannot be hurt if it should be cast into hell
fire, no more than Shadrach, Meshech, and Abednego, were hurt in the
burning oven. In one word, God is not only to the souls, but also to the
bodies of the saints, all in all things; a glass to their sight, honey
to their taste, music to their hearing, balm to their smelling. - John
Boys.

[Psa 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011.md)

"In thy presence is fulness of joy." The saints on earth are all but
viatores, wayfaring men, wandering pilgrims far from home; but the
saints in heaven are comprehensores, safely arrived at the end of their
journey. All we here present for the present, are but mere strangers in
the midst of danger, we are losing ourselves and losing our lives in the
land of the dying. But ere long, we may find our lives and ourselves
again in heaven with the Lord of life, being found of him in the land of
the living. If when we die, we be in the Lord of life, our souls are
sure to be bound up in the bundle of life, that so when we live again we
may be sure to find them in the life of the Lord. Now we have but a
dram, but a scruple, but a grain of happiness, to an ounce, to a pound,
to a thousand weight of heaviness; now we have but a drop of joy to an
ocean of sorrow; but a moment of ease to an age of pain; but then (as
St. Austin very sweetly in his Soliloquies), we shall have endless ease
without any pain, true happiness without any heaviness, the greatest
measure of felicity without the least of misery, the fullest measure of
joy that may be, without any mixture of grief. Here therefore (as St.
Gregory the divine adviseth us), let us ease our heaviest loads of
sufferings, and sweeten our bitterest cups of sorrows with the continual
meditation and constant expectation of the fulness of joy in the
presence of God, and of the pleasure at his right hand for evermore.

"In thy presence, is," etc., there it is, not there it was, nor there it
may be, nor there it will be, but there it is, there it is without
cessation or intercision, there it always hath been, and is, and must
be. It is an assertion aeternae veritatis, that is always true, it may
at any time be said that there it is. "In thy presence is the fulness of
joy;" and herein consists the consummation of felicity; or what does any
man here present wish for more than joy? And what measure of joy can any
man wish for more than fulness of joy? And what kind of fulness would
any man wish for rather than this fulness, the fulness κατ̓ ἐξοχὴν? And
where would any man wish to enjoy this fulness of joy rather than in the
presence of God, which is the ever-flowing and the over-flowing fountain
of joy? And when would any man wish for this enjoyment of the fulness of
joy in the very fountain of joy rather than presently, constantly, and
incessantly? Now all these desirables are encircled within the compass
of the first remarkable, to make up the consummation of true felicity.
"In thy presence is fulness of joy." - "The Consummation of Felicity,"
by Edward Willan, 1645.

[Psa 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011.md)

The human nature of Christ in heaven hath a double capacity of glory,
happiness and delight; one on that mere fellowship and communion with
his Father and the other persons, through his personal union with the
Godhead. Which joy of his in this fellowship, Christ himself speaks of
as to be enjoyed by him: "In thy presence is fulness of joy, and at thy
right hand are pleasures for evermore." And this is a constant and
settled fulness of pleasure, such as admits not any addition or
diminution, but is always one and the same, and absolute and entire in
itself; and of itself alone sufficient for the Son of God, and heir of
all things to live upon, though he should have had no other comings in
of joy and delight from any creature. And this is his natural
inheritance. - Thomas Godwin.

[Psa 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011.md)

"In thy presence is fulness of joy." In heaven they are free from want;
they can want nothing there unless it be want itself. They may find the
want of evil, but never find the evil of want. Evil is but the want of
good, and the want of evil is but the absence of want. God is good, and
no want of good can be in God. What want then can be endured in the
presence of God, where no evil is, but all good that the fulness of joy
may be enjoyed? Here some men eat their meat without any hunger, whilst
others hunger without any meat to eat, and some men drink extremely
without any thirst, whilst o hers thirst extremely without any drink.
But in the glorious presence of God, not any one can be pampered with
too much, nor any one be pined with too little. They that gather much of
the heavenly manna, "have nothing over;" and "they that gather little
have no lack. They that are once possessed of that presence of God, are
so possessed with if that they can never feel the misery of thirst or
hunger. - Edward Willan.

[Psa 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011.md)

"Fulness." Every soul shall there enjoy an infinite happiness, because
it shall enjoy infinite goodness. And it shall be for ever enjoyed,
without disliking of it, or losing of it, or lacking any of it. Every
soul shall enjoy as much good in that presence, by the presence of that
good, as it shall be able to receive, or to desire to receive. As much
as shall make it fully happy. Every one shall be filled so
proportionately full; and every desire in any soul shall be fulfilled so
perfectly in that presence of glory, with the glory of that presence,
that no one shall ever wish for any more, or ever be weary of that it
has, or be willing to change it for any other. - Edward Willan.

[Psa 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011.md)

"Fulness of joy." When a man comes to the sea, he doth not complain that
he wants his cistern of water: though thou didst suck comfort from thy
relations; yet when thou comest to the ocean, and art with Christ, thou
shalt never complain that thou hast left thy cistern behind. There will
be nothing to breed sorrow in heaven; there shall be joy, and nothing
but joy, heaven is set out by that phrase, "Enter thou into the joy of
thy Lord." Here joy enters into us, there we enter into joy; the joys we
have here are from heaven; the joys that we shall have with Christ are
without measure and without mixture. "In thy presence is fulness of
joy." - Thomas Watson.

[Psa 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011.md)

"In thy presence is fulness of joy." In this life our joy is mixed with
sorrow like a prick under the rose. Jacob had joy when his sons returned
home from Egypt with the sacks full of corn, but much sorrow when he
perceived the silver in the sack's mouth. David had much joy in bringing
up the ark of God, but at the same time great sorrow for the breach made
upon Uzza. This is the Lord's great wisdom to temper and moderate our
joy. As men of a weak constitution must have their wine qualified with
water for fear of distemper, so must we in this life (such is our
weakness), have our joy mixed with sorrow, lest we turn giddy and
insolent. Here our joy is mixed with fear ([Psa
2:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001).md), "Rejoice with trembling;" the
women departed from the sepulchre of our Lord "with fear and great joy."
[Mat 28:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#008.md). In our regenerate estate,
though we have joy from Christ that is "formed in us," yet the
impression of the terrors of God before the time of our new birth
remains in us; as in a commotion of the sea by a great tempest after a
stormy wind hath ceased, yet the impression of the storm remains and
makes an agitation. The tender mother recovering her young child from
danger of a fall hath joy from the recovery; but with much fear with the
impression of the danger: so after we are recovered here from our
dangerous fails by the rich and tender mercies of our God, sometime
preventing us, sometime restoring us, though we rejoice in his mercy,
and in our own recovery out of the snares of Satan, yet in the midst of
our joy the remembrance of former guiltiness and danger do humble our
hearts with much sorrow, and some trepidation of heart. As our joy here
is mixed with fears, so with sorrow also. Sound believers do look up to
Christ crucified, and do rejoice in his incomparable love, that such a
person should have died such a death for such as were enemies to God by
sinful inclinations and wicked works; they look down also upon their own
sins that have wounded and crucified the Lord of glory, and this
breaketh the heart, as a widow should mourn, who by her froward and lewd
behaviour hath burst the heart of a kind and loving husband.

The sound believers look to their small beginnings of grace, and they
rejoice in the work of God's hands; but when they compare it with that
original and primitive righteousness, they mourn bitterly, as the eiders
of Israel did at the rebuilding of the temple ([Ezr
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#012).md); "They who had seen the first
house wept." But in heaven our joy will be full, without mixture of
sorrow ([Joh 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#020).md); "Your sorrow,"
saith our Lord, "shall be turned into joy." Then will there be no sorrow
for a present trouble, nor present fear of future troubles. Then their
eye will deeply affect their heart' the sight and knowledge of God the
supreme and infinite good will ravish, and take up all their heart with
joy and delight. Peter in the Mount (Matthew 17), was so affected with
that glorious sight, that he forgot both the delights and troubles that
were below; "It is good to be here," said he. How much more will all
worldly troubles and delights be forgot at that soul-satisfying sight in
heaven, which is as far above that of Peter in the Mount, as the third
heaven is above that Mount, and as the uncreated is above the created
glory! - William Colvill' s "Refreshing Streams," 1655.

[Psa 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011.md)

"In thy presence is Fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are
pleasures for evermore." Mark, for quality, there are pleasures; for
quantity, fulness; for dignity, at God's right hand; for eternity, for
evermore. And millions of years multiplied by millions, make not up one
minute, to this eternity of joy that the saints shall have in heaven. In
heaven there shall be no sin to take away your joy, nor no devil to take
away your joy; nor no man to take away your joy. "Your joy no man taketh
from you." [Joh 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#022.md). The joy of the
saints in heaven is never ebbing, but always flowing to all contentment.
The joys of heaven never fade, never wither, never die, nor never are
lessened nor interrupted. The joy of the saints in heaven is a constant
joy, an everlasting joy, in the root and in the cause, and in the matter
of it and in the objects of it. "Their joy lasts for ever whose objects
remain for ever" - Thomas Brooks.

[Psa 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011.md)

"Pleasures forevermore." The soul that is once landed at the heavenly
shore is past all storms. The glorified soul shall be for ever bathing
itself in the rivers of pleasure. This is that which makes heaven to be
heaven, "We shall be ever with the Lord." [Th1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#017.md). Austin saith, "Lord, I am
content to suffer any pains and torments in this world, if I might see
thy face one day; but alas I were it only a day, then to be ejected
heaven, it would rather be an aggravation of misery;" but this word,
"ever with the Lord," is very accumulative, and makes up the garland of
glory: a state of eternity is a state of security. - Thomas Watson.

[Psa 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011.md)

This then may serve for a ground of comfort to every soul distressed
with the tedious bitterness of this life; for short sorrow here, we
shall have eternal joy; for a little hunger, an eternal banquet; for
light sickness and affliction, everlasting health and salvation; for a
little imprisonment, endless liberty; for disgrace, glory. Instead of
the wicked who oppress and afflict them, they shall have the angels and
saints to comfort and solace them, instead of Satan to torment and tempt
them, they shall have Jesus to ravish and affect them. Joseph's prison
shall be turned into a palace; Daniel's lions' den into the presence of
the Lion of the Tribe of Judah; the three children's hot fiery furnace,
into the New Jerusalem of pure gold; David's Gath, into the tabernacle
of the living God. - John Cragge's "Cabinet of Spiritual Jewells," 1657

[Psa 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011.md)

This heavenly feast will not have an end, as Ahasuerus's feast had,
though it lasted many days; but "At thy right hand are pleasures for
evermore." - William Colvill.

[Psalms 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 16:1</span></span>

1 Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.

"Preserve me," keep, or save me, or as Horsley thinks, "guard me," even
as bodyguards surround their monarch, or as shepherds protect their
flocks. Tempted in all points like as we are, the manhood of Jesus
needed to be preserved from the power of evil; and though in itself
pure, the Lord Jesus did not confide in that purity of nature, but as an
example to his followers, looked to the Lord, his God, for preservation.
One of the great names of God is "the Preserver of men," ([Job
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#020).md), and this gracious office the
Father exercised towards our Mediator and Representative. It had been
promised to the Lord Jesus in express words, that he should be
preserved, [Isa 49:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#007.md), [Isa
49:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#008.md). "Thus saith the Lord, the
Redeemer of Israel and his Holy One, to him whom man despiseth, to him
whom the nation abhorreth, I will preserve thee, and give thee for a
covenant of the people." This promise was to the letter fulfilled, both
by providential deliverance and sustaining power, in the case of our
Lord. Being preserved himself, he is able to restore the preserved of
Israel, for we are "preserved in Christ Jesus and called." As one with
him, the elect were preserved in his preservation, and we may view this
mediatorial supplication as the petition of the Great High Priest for
all those who are in him. The intercession recorded in John 17 is but an
amplification of this cry, "Holy Father, keep through thine own name
those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are." When he
says "preserve me," he means his members, his mystical body, himself,
and all in him. But while we rejoice in the fact that the Lord Jesus
used this prayer for his members, we must not forget that he employed it
most surely for himself; he had so emptied himself, and so truly taken
upon him the form of a servant, that as man he needed divine keeping
even as we do, and often cried unto the strong for strength. Frequently
on the mountaintop he breathed forth this desire, and on one occasion in
almost the same words, he publicly prayed, "Father, save me from this
hour." ([Joh 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#027)..md) If Jesus looked
out of himself for protection, how much more must we, his erring
followers, do so!

"O God." The word for God here used is El אל, by which name the Lord
Jesus, when under a sense of great weakness, as for instance when upon
the cross, was wont to address the Mighty God, the Omnipotent Helper of
his people. We, too, may turn to El, the Omnipotent One, in all hours of
peril, with the confidence that he who heard the strong cryings and
tears of our faithful High Priest, is both able and willing to bless us
in him. It is well to study the name and character of God, so that in
our straits we may know how and by what title to address our Father who
is in heaven.

"For in thee do I put my trust," or, I have taken shelter in thee. As
chickens run beneath the hen, so do I betake myself to thee. Thou art my
great overshadowing Protector, and I have taken refuge beneath thy
strength. This is a potent argument in pleading, and our Lord knew not
only how to use it with God, but how to yield to its power when wielded
by others upon himself. "According to thy faith be it done unto thee,"
is a great rule of heaven in dispensing favour, and when we can
sincerely declare that we exercise faith in the Mighty God with regard
to the mercy which we seek, we may rest assured that our plea will
prevail. Faith, like the sword of Saul, never returns empty; it
overcomes heaven when held in the hand of prayer. As the Saviour prayed,
so let us pray, and as he became more than a conqueror, so shall we also
through him; let us when buffeted by storms right bravely cry to the
Lord as he did, "in thee do I put my trust."

[Psalms 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 16:2</span></span>

2 O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord: my goodness
extendeth not to thee:

3 But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom
is all my delight.

4 Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their
drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into
my lips.

5 The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou
maintainest my lot.

"O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord." In his
inmost heart the Lord Jesus bowed himself to do service to his Heavenly
Father, and before the throne of Jehovah his soul vowed allegiance to
the Lord for our sakes. We are like him when our soul, truly and
constantly in the presence of the heart-searching God, declares her full
consent to the rule and government of the Infinite Jehovah, saying,
"Thou art my Lord." To avow this with the lip is little, but for the
soul to say it, especially in times of trial, is a gracious evidence of
spiritual health; to profess it before men is a small matter, but to
declare it before Jehovah himself is of far more consequence. This
sentence may also be viewed as the utterance of appropriating faith,
laying hold upon the Lord by personal covenant and enjoyment; in this
sense may it be our daily song in the house of our pilgrimage.

"My goodness extendeth not to thee." The work of our Lord Jesus was not
needful on account of any necessity in the Divine Being. Jehovah would
have been inconceivably glorious had the human race perished, and had no
atonement been offered. Although the life-work and death-agony of the
Son did reflect unparalleled lustre upon every attribute of God, yet the
Most Blessed and Infinitely Happy God stood in no need of the obedience
and death of his Son; it was for our sakes that the work of redemption
was undertaken, and not because of any lack or want on the part of the
Most High. How modestly does the Savior here estimate his own goodness!
What overwhelming reasons have we for imitating his humility! "If thou
be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?"
([Job 35:7](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#007)..md)

"But to the saints that are in the earth." These sanctified ones,
although still upon the earth, partake of the results of Jesus'
mediatorial work, and by his goodness are made what they are. The
peculiar people, zealous for good works, and hallowed to sacred service,
are arrayed in the Saviour's righteousness and washed in his blood, and
so receive of the goodness treasured up in him; these are the persons
who are profited by the work of the man Christ Jesus; but that work
added nothing to the nature, virtue, or happiness of God, who is blessed
for evermore. How much more forcibly is this true of us, poor unworthy
servants, not fit to be mentioned in comparison with the faithful Son of
God! Our hope must ever be that haply some poor child of God may be
served by us, for the Great Father can never need our aid. Well may we
sing the verses of Dr. Watts:

"Oft have my heart and tongue confess'd

How empty and how poor I am;

My praise can never make thee blest,

Nor add new glories to thy name.

Yet, Lord, thy saints on earth may reap

Some profit by the good we do;

These are the company I keep,

These are the choicest friends I know."

Poor believers are God's receivers, and have a warrant from the Crown to
receive the revenue of our offerings in the King's name. Saints departed
we cannot bless; even prayer for them is of no service; but while they
are here we should practically prove our love to them, even as our
Master did, for they are the excellent of the earth. Despite their
infirmities, their Lord thinks highly of them, and reckons them to be as
nobles among men. The title of "His Excellency" more properly belongs to
the meanest saint than to the greatest governor. The true aristocracy
are believers in Jesus. They are the only Right Honourables. Stars and
garters are poor distinctions compared with the graces of the Spirit. He
who knows them best says of them, "in whom is all my delight." They are
his Hephzibah and his land Beulah, and before all worlds his delights
were with these chosen sons of men. Their own opinion of themselves is
far other than their Beloved's opinion of them; they count themselves to
be less that nothing, yet he makes much of them, and sets his heart
towards them. What wonders the eyes of Divine Love can see w ere the
hands of Infinite Power have been graciously at work. It was this
quicksighted affection which led Jesus to see in us a recompense for all
his agony, and sustained him under all his sufferings by the joy of
redeeming us from going down into the pit.

The same loving heart which opens towards the chosen people is fast
dosed against those who continue in their rebellion against God. Jesus
hates all wickedness, and especially the high crime of idolatry. The
text while it shows our Lord's abhorrence of sin, shows also the
sinner's greediness after it. Professed believers are often slow towards
the true Lord, but sinners "hasten after another god." They run like
madmen where we creep like snails. Let their zeal rebuke our tardiness.
Yet theirs is a case in which the more they haste the worse they speed,
for their sorrows are multiplied by their diligence in multiplying their
sins. Matthew Henry pithily says, "They that multiply gods multiply
griefs to themselves; for whosoever thinks one god too little, will find
two too many, and yet hundreds not enough." The cruelties and hardships
which men endure for their false gods is wonderful to contemplate; our
missionary reports are a noteworthy comment on this passage; but perhaps
our own experience is an equally vivid exposition; for when we have
given our heart to idols, sooner or later we have had to smart for it.
Near the roots of our self-love all our sorrows lie, and when that idol
is overthrown, the sting is gone from grief. Moses broke the golden calf
and ground it to powder, and cast it into the water of which he made
Israel to drink, and so shall our cherished idols become bitter portions
for us, unless we at once forsake them. Our Lord had no selfishness; he
served but one Lord, and served him only. As for those who turn aside
from Jehovah, he was separate from them, bearing their reproach without
the camp. Sin and the Saviour had no communion. He came to destroy, not
to patronize or be allied with the works of the devil. Hence he refused
the testimony of unclean spirits as to his divinity, for in nothing
would he have fellowship with darkness. We should be careful above
measure not to connect ourselves in the remotest degree with falsehood
in religion; even the most solemn of Popish rites we must abhor. "Their
drink offerings of blood will I not offer." The old proverb says, "It is
not safe to eat at the devil's mess, though the spoon be never so long."
The mere mentioning of ill names it were well to avoid, - "nor take up
their names into my lips." If we allow poison upon the lip, it may ere
long penetrate to the inwards, and it is well to keep out of the mouth
that which we would shut out from the heart. If the Church would enjoy
union with Christ, she must break all the bonds of impiety, and keep
herself pure from all the pollutions of carnal will-worship, which now
pollute the service of God. Some professors are guilty of great sin in
remaining in the communion of Popish churches, where God is as much
dishonoured as in Rome herself, only in a more crafty manner.

"The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup." With what
confidence and bounding joy does Jesus turn to Jehovah, whom his soul
possessed and delighted in! Content beyond measure with his portion in
the Lord his God, he had not a single desire with which to hunt after
other gods; his cup was full, and his heart was full too; even in his
sorest sorrows he still laid hold with both his hands upon his Father,
crying, "My God, my God;" he had not so much as a thought of falling
down to worship the prince of this world, although tempted with an "all
these will I give thee." We, too, can make our boast in the Lord; he is
the meat and the drink of our souls. He is our portion, supplying all
our necessities, and our cup yielding royal luxuries; our cup in this
life, and our inheritance in the life to come. As children of the Father
who is in heaven, we inherit, by virtue of our joint heirship with
Jesus, all the riches of the covenant of grace; and the portion which
falls to us sets upon our table the bread of heaven and the new wine of
the kingdom. Who would not be satisfied with such dainty diet? Our
shallow cup of sorrow we may well drain with resignation, since the deep
cup of love stands side by side with it, and will never be empty. "Thou
maintainest my lot." Some tenants have a covenant in their leases that
they themselves shall maintain and uphold, but in our case Jehovah
himself maintains our lot. Our Lord Jesus delighted in this truth, that
the Father was on his side, and would maintain his right against all the
wrongs of men. He knew that his elect would be reserved for him, and
that almighty power would preserve them as his lot and reward for ever.
Let us also be glad, because the Judge of all the earth will vindicate
our righteous cause.

[Psalms 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 16:6</span></span>

6 The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly
heritage.

7 I will bless the Lord, who hath given me counsel: my reins also
instruct me in the night seasons.

Jesus found the way of obedience to lead into "pleasant places."
Notwithstanding all the sorrows which marred his countenance, he
exclaimed, "Lo, I come; in the volume of the book it is written of me, I
delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart." It
may seem strange, but while no other man was ever so thoroughly
acquainted with grief, it is our belief that no other man ever
experienced so much joy and delight in service, for no other served so
faithfully and with such great results in view as his recompense of
reward. The joy which was set before him must have sent some of its
beams of splendour a-down the rugged places where he endured the cross,
despising the shame, and must have made them in some respects pleasant
places to the generous heart of the Redeemer. At any rate, we know that
Jesus was well content with the blood-bought portion which the lines of
electing love marked off as his spoil with the strong and his portion
with the great. Therein he solaced himself on earth, and delights
himself in heaven; and he asks no more "Goodly Heritage" than that his
own beloved may be with him where he is and behold his glory. All the
saints can use the language of this verse, and the more thoroughly they
can enter into its contented, grateful, joyful spirit the better for
themselves, and the more glorious to their God. Our Lord was poorer than
we are, for he had not where to lay his head, and yet when he mentioned
his poverty he never used a word of murmuring; discontented spirits are
as unlike Jesus as the croaking raven is unlike the cooing dove. Martyrs
have been happy in dungeons. "From the delectable orchard of the Leonine
prison the Italian martyr dated his letter, and the presence of God made
the gridiron of Laurence pleasant to him." Mr. Greenham was bold enough
to say, "They never felt God's love, or tasted forgiveness of sins, who
are discontented." Some divines think that discontent was the first sin,
the rock which wrecked our race in paradise; certainly there can be no
paradise where this evil spirit has power, its slime will poison all the
flowers of the garden.

"I will bless the Lord, who hath given me counsel." Praise as well as
prayer was presented to the Father by our Lord Jesus, and we are not
truly his followers unless our resolve be, "I will bless the Lord."
Jesus is called Wonderful, Counsellor, but as man he spake not of
himself, but as his Father had taught him. Read in confirmation of this,
[Joh 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#016.md); [Joh
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#028.md); and [Joh
12:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#049.md), [Joh
12:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#050.md); and the prophecy concerning him
in [Isa 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002.md), [Isa
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#003.md). It was our Redeemer's wont to
repair to his Father for direction, and having received it, he blessed
him for giving him counsel. It would be well for us if we would follow
his example of lowliness, cease from trusting in our own understanding,
and seek to be guided by the Spirit of God. "My reins also instruct me
in the night seasons." By the reins understand the inner man, the
affections and feelings. The communion of the soul with God brings to it
an inner spiritual wisdom which in still seasons is revealed to itself.
Our Redeemer spent many nights alone upon the mountain, and we may
readily conceive that together with his fellowship with heaven, he
carried on a profitable commerce with himself; reviewing his experience,
forecasting his work, and considering his position. Great generals fight
their battles in their own mind long before the trumpet sounds, and so
did our Lord win our battle on his knees before he gained it on the
cross. It is a gracious habit after taking counsel from above to take
counsel within. Wise men see more with their eyes shut by night than
fools can see by day with their eyes open. He who learns from God and so
gets the seed, will soon find wisdom within himself growing in the
garden of his soul; "Thine ears shall hear a voice behind thee, saying,
This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand and when
ye turn to the left." The night season which the sinner chooses for his
sins is the hallowed hour of quiet when believers hear the soft still
voices of heaven, and of the heavenly life within themselves.

[Psalms 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 16:8</span></span>

8 I have set the Lord always before me: because he is at my right hand,
I shall not be moved.

9 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also
shall rest in hope.

10 For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer
thine Holy One to see corruption.

11 Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of
joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.

The fear of death at one time cast its dark shadow over the soul of the
Redeemer, and we read that "he was heard in that he feared." There
appeared unto him an angel, strengthening him; perhaps the heavenly
messenger reassured him of his glorious resurrection as his people's
surety, and of the eternal joy into which he should admit the flock
redeemed by blood. Then hope shone full upon our Lord's soul, and, as
recorded in these verses, he surveyed the future with holy confidence
because he had a continued eye to Jehovah, and enjoyed his perpetual
presence. He felt that thus sustained, he could never be driven from his
life's grand design; nor was he, for he stayed not his hand till he
could say, "It is finished." What an infinite mercy was this for us! In
this immoveableness, caused by simple faith in the divine help, Jesus is
to be viewed as our exemplar; to recognize the presence of the Lord is
the duty of every believer; "I have set the Lord always before me;" and
to trust the Lord as our champion and guard is the privilege of every
saint; "because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved." The
apostle translates this passage, "I foresaw the Lord always before my
face;" [Act 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#025.md); the eye of Jesus'
faith could discern beforehand the continuance of divine support to his
suffering Son, in such a degree that he should never be moved from the
accomplishment of his purpose of redeeming his people. By the power of
God at his right hand he foresaw that he should smite through all who
rose up against him, and on that power he placed the firmest reliance.
He clearly foresaw that he must die, for he speaks of his flesh resting,
and of his soul in the abode of separate spirits; death was full before
his face, or he would not have mentioned corruption; but such was his
devout reliance upon his God, that he sang over the tomb, and rejoiced
in vision of the sepulchre. He knew that the visit of his soul to Sheol,
or the invisible world of disembodied spirits, would be a very short
one, and that his body in a very brief space would leave the grave,
uninjured by its sojourn there; all this made him say, "my heart is
glad," and moved his tongue, the glory of his frame, to rejoice in God,
the strength of his salvation. Oh for such holy faith in the prospect of
trial and of death! It is the work of faith, not merely to create a
peace which passeth all understanding, but to fill the heart full of
gladness until the tongue, which, as the organ of an intelligent
creature, is our glory, bursts forth in notes of harmonious praise.
Faith gives us living joy, and bestows dying rest. "My flesh also shall
rest in hope."

Our Lord Jesus was not disappointed in his hope. He declared his
Father's faithfulness in the words, "thou wilt not leave my soul in
hell," and that faithfulness was proven on the resurrection morning.
Among the departed and disembodied Jesus was not left; he had believed
in the resurrection, and he received it on the third day, when his body
rose in glorious life, according as he had said in joyous confidence,
"neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption." Into the
outer prison of the grave his body might go, but into the inner prison
of corruption he could not enter. He who in soul and body was
pre-eminently God's "Holy One," was loosed from the pains of death,
because it was not possible that he should be holden of it. This is
noble encouragement to all the saints; die they must, but rise they
shall, and though in their case they shall see corruption, yet they
shall rise to everlasting life. Christ's resurrection is the cause, the
earnest, the guarantee, and the emblem of the rising of all his people.
Let them, therefore, go to their graves as to their beds, resting their
flesh among the clods as they now do upon their couches.

"Since Jesus is mine, I'll not fear undressing,

But gladly put off these garments of clay;

To die in the Lord is a covenant blessing,

Since Jesus to glory through death led the way."

Wretched will that man be who, when the Philistines of death invade his
soul, shall find that, like Saul, he is forsaken of God; but blessed is
he who has the Lord at his right hand, for he shall fear no ill, but
shall look forward to an eternity of bliss.

[Psa 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011.md)

"Thou wilt shew me the path of life." To Jesus first this way was shown,
for he is the first-begotten from the dead, the first-born of every
creature. He himself opened up the way through his own flesh, and then
trod it as the forerunner of his own redeemed. The thought of being made
the path of life to his people, gladdened the soul of Jesus. "In thy
presence is fullness of joy." Christ being raised from the dead ascended
into glory, to dwell in constant nearness to God, where joy is at its
full for ever: the foresight of this urged him onward in his glorious
but grievous toil. To bring his chosen to eternal happiness was the high
ambition which inspired him, and made him wade through a sea of blood. O
God, when the worldling's mirth has all expired, for ever with Jesus may
we dwell "at thy right hand," where "there are pleasures for evermore;"
and meanwhile, may we have an earnest by tasting thy love below. Trapp's
note on the heavenly verse which closes the Psalm is a sweet morsel,
which may serve for a contemplation, and yield a foretaste of our
inheritance. He writes, "Here is as much said as can be, but words are
too weak to utter it. For quality there is in heaven joy and pleasures;
for quantity, a fulness, a torrent whereat they drink without let or
loathing; for constancy, it is at God's right hand, who is stronger than
all, neither can any take us out of his hand; it is a constant happiness
without intermission: and for perpetuity it is for evermore. Heaven's
joys are without measure, mixture, or end."
