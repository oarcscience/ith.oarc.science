The Treasury of David

by Charles Haddon Spurgeon (1834-1892)

Charles Haddon Spurgeon was England's best-known preacher for most of
the second half of the nineteenth century. In 1854, just four years
after his conversion, Spurgeon, then only 20, became pastor of London's
famed New Park Street Church (formerly pastored by the famous Baptist
theologian John Gill). The congregation quickly outgrew their building,
moved to Exeter Hall, then to Surrey Music Hall. In these venues
Spurgeon frequently preached to audiences numbering more than
10,000â€”all in the days before electronic amplification. In 1861 the
congregation moved permanently to the newly constructed Metropolitan
Tabernacle.

This work was first published in weekly installments over a twenty-year
span in the London Metropolitan Tabernacle's periodical, The Sword and
the Trowel. Completed sections were released volume by volume, until the
seventh and final volume was released in 1885.

The Treasury of David is a superb literary achievement. Eric Hayden,
pastor of the Metropolitan Tabernacle a century after Spurgeon's
ministry began there, calls this work "Spurgeon's magnum opus."
Spurgeon's wife said that if Spurgeon had never written any other work,
this would have been a permanent literary memorial.
