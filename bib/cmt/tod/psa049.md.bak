### [Psalms Chapter 49](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 49:0</span></span>

TITLE - To the chief Musician, a Psalm for the sons of Korah. This is
precisely the same as on former occasions, and no remark is needed.

Division - The poet musician sings, to the accompaniment of his harp,
the despicable character of those who trust in their wealth, and so he
consoles the oppressed believer. The first [Psa
49:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#001.md)are a preface; from [Psa
49:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#005.md)all fear of great oppressors is
removed by the remembrance of their end and their folly; [Psa
49:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#013.md)contains an expression of wonder
at the perpetuity of folly; [Psa 49:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#014.md)
and [Psa 49:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#015.md)contrast the ungodly and
the righteous in their future; and from [Psa
49:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#016.md)the lesson from the whole is
given in an admonitory form. Note the chorus in [Psa
49:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#012.md) and [Psa
49:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#020.md), and also the two Selahs.

Hints to Preachers

[Psa 49:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#002.md) -

I. The common needs of rich and poor men.

II\. The common privileges of rich and poor saints.

III\. Their common service.

IV\. Their common heaven.

[Psa 49:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#003.md) - The deep things of God are
intended,

I. To exercise our minds to understand them.

II\. To try our faith by believing them - "incline" implies a submissive
mind.

III\. To excite our joy as we grasp them - "upon the harp."

IV\. To employ our faculties in explaining them to others.

[Psa 49:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#005.md) -

I. The effects of our sin remain,

1\. In ourselves.

2\. In others.

II\. In a time of conviction they "compass us about:" better to do so in
this life, than to haunt us as ghosts for ever.

III\. When they are pardoned we have nothing to fear.

\- G. R.

[Psa 49:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#007.md) -

1\. Implied. The soul needs redeeming.

2\. Denied. Wealth, power, learning, none can redeem.

3\. Supplied - a ransom by Jesus.

4\. Applied - by the Spirit to our actual deliverance.

[Psa 49:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#012) (last clause.md) - Wherein the
ungodly are like beasts, and wherein different.

[Psa 49:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#012.md) - Here is a twofold
thwarting or crossing of the purposes of the ungodly worldling.

I. The first is, he shall not be that which he ever wished to be: he
shall not continue in honour.

II\. The other is this, he shall be that which he never desired to be:
he shall be like the beasts that die. He shall miss of that which he
sought for, and he shall have that which he looked not for.

\- S. Hieton.

[Psa 49:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#014.md) -

I. In proportion to the prosperity of the ungodly here, will be their
misery hereafter: as sheep from the fat pasture led to the
slaughter-house.

II\. In proportion to their luxury here, will be their corruption
hereafters - "Death shall feed on them:" they have become well fed for
death to feed on them.

III\. In proportion to their dignity here, will be their degradation
hereafter - "The upright shall have," etc. Oh, what a contrast between
the rich man and Lazarus then!

IV\. In proportion to their beauty here, will be their deformity
hereafter. "Art, thou become like one of us? "

\- G. R.

[Psa 49:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#014.md) - Sheep, how far they image
the wicked.

[Psa 49:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#014.md) - "In the morning." See the
various Biblical prophecies of what will happen "in the morning."

[Psa 49:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#015.md) -

1\. Return to the dust I shall.

2\. Redeem groin the dust he will.

3\. Receive into heaven he will.

4\. Rejoice for ever I shall.

[Psa 49:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#017.md) - The loaded and unloaded
sinner.

[Psa 49:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#020.md) -

I. Men of spiritual understanding without worldly honour are higher than
the angels of God in heaven.

II\. Men in worldly honour without the true wisdom are worse than the
beasts that perish.

\- G.R.

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Whole Psalm

Strange it is that two Psalms so near together, as this and the
forty-fifth should, and should alone imitate, or be the forerunners of,
two works of David's son; this Ecclesiastes, the former - the Canticles.
- J. M. Neale.

[Psa 49:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#002.md)

In this Psalm David, as it were, summons and divides mankind. In the
first verse he summons. "Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye
inhabitants of the world." In the second verse he divides: "Both low and
high, rich and poor, together." The word in the Hebrew for "high" is
בּני אישׁ, bene ish, sons of Ish, and the word for "low" is בּני אדם,
bene Adam, sons of Adam. If we should translate the text directly,
according to the letter, the words must run, sons of men and sons of
men; for, sons of Adam and sons of Ish are both translated sons of men.
Yet when they are set together in a way of opposition, the one
signifieth "low" and the other "high;" and so our translators render it
according to the sense, not sons of men and sons of men, but "low" and
"high." Junius translates to this sense, though in more words, as well
they who are born of mean men, as they who are born of honourable. -
Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 49:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#004.md)

"I will incline mine ear to a parable," i.e., I will diligently attend,
that I may not sing anything ungracefully; a metaphor taken from
musicians who bring their ear close to the harp, that they may ascertain
the harmony of the sound. - Victorinus Bythner.

[Psa 49:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#005.md)

"Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my
heels shall compass me about?" Those that are full of years are
approaching the nearer to their happiness. They have finished their
voyage, and now are in sight of the haven. Nature's provision is spent,
her stock is exhausted, and now the good man doth not so much descend as
fall into the grave, and from thence he rises to heaven and eternal
bliss. And shall he be disturbed at this? shall he be afraid to be made
happy? If I mistake not, this is the meaning of the Psalmist's words.
They are generally interpreted concerning his ways in general, but they
seem to me to refer particularly to the calamity which his old age was
incident to: for "the days of evil" are old age, and are so called by
the wise man ([Ecc 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#001).md); and as the
"heel" is the extreme part of the body, so it is here applied to the
last part of man's life, his declining age; and "iniquity" (as the word
is sometimes used among the Hebrews) signifies here penal evil, and
denotes the infirmities and decays of the concluding part of a man's
life. So that the true meaning of the Psalmist's words, is this, I will
not now in my last days be dejected with fear and trouble of mind, for I
am coming towards my happiness, my declining years shall deliver me up
to earth, and that shall consign me to everlasting life. This certainly
is matter of joy rather than of fear. For this reason I account my last
days to be the most eligible part of my whole life. - John Edwards, D.D.
(1637-1716), in "Theologia Reformata."

[Psa 49:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#005.md)

"Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my
heels shall compass me about?" That is, when my sins or failings in what
I have done, come to my remembrance, or are chastened upon me. Every
man's heel hath some iniquity: as we shall have some dirt cleaving to
our heels while we walk in a dirty world, so there is some dirt, some
defilement, upon all our actions, which we may call, the iniquity of our
heel. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 49:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#005.md)

"When the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?" With Bishop
Lowth, the celebrated Michaelis, Bishop Hare, and a hast of other
critics, I decidedly incline to the idea, that עקבי, rendered "my heels"
is to be regarded as the present participle of the verb עקב, to
supplant, to act deceitfully, to deceive, to hold one by the heel, etc.,
etc. If this be correct then the proper translation will be: -

Wherefore should I fear in the days of adversity,

The iniquity of my supplanters who surround me?

The Syriac and Arabic read, as does also Dr. Kennicott: -

Why should I fear in the evil day,

When the iniquity of my enemies compasses me about?

John Morison.

[Psa 49:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#005.md)

Why should I fear the evil hour,

When ruthless foes in ambush lie,

Who revel in their pride of power,

And on their hoarded wealth rely?

A brother's ransom who can pay,

Or alter God's eternal doom?

What hand can wrest from death his prey,

Its banquet from the rotting tomb?

From "The Psalter, or Psalms of David, in English verse. By a Member of
the University of Cambridge." \[Benjamin Hall Kennedy, D.D.\] 1860.

[Psa 49:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#006.md)

"They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude
of their riches." Here we have the rich man trusting and boasting;
surely that is very confident trusting which issues itself into
boasting! That man is ascended to the highest step of faith in God, who
makes his boast of God; such faith have they in fine gold who boast in
it. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 49:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#006.md)

"They that trust in their wealth." "The Covetous Man's Soliloquy."
Believe me, the times are hard and dangerous; charity is grown cold, and
friends uncomfortable; an empty purse is full of sorrow, and hollow bags
make a heavy heart. Poverty is a civil pestilence, which frights away
both friends and kindred and leaves us to a "Lord have mercy upon us."
It is a sickness very catching and infectious, and more commonly
abhorred than cured. The best antidote against it is Angelica and
providence, and the best cordial is aurum potabile. Gold-taking fasting
is an approved sovereign. Debts are ill humours, and turn at last to
dangerous obstructions. Lending is a mere consumption of the radical
humour, which, if consumed, brings a patient to nothing. Let others
trust to courtiers' promises, to friends, performances, to princes'
favours; give me a toy called gold, give me a thing called money. O
blessed Mammon, how extremely sweet is thy all-commanding presence to my
thriving soul! In banishment thou art my dear companion; in captivity
thou art my precious ransom; in trouble and vexation thou art my dainty
rest; in sickness thou art my health; in grief my only joy; in all
extremity my only trust. Virtue must veil to thee; nay, grace itself,
not relished with thy sweetness, would even displease the righteous
palates of the sons of men. Come, then, my soul, advise, contrive,
project; go, compass sea and land; leave no exploit untried, no path
untrod, no time unspent; afford thine eyes no sleep, thy head no rest;
neglect thy ravenous belly, unclothe thy back; deceive, betray, swear,
and forswear, to compass such a friend. If thou be base in birth, it
will make thee honourable; if weak in power, it will make thee
formidable. Are thy friends few? It will make them numerous. Is thy
cause bad? It will gain thee advocates. True, wisdom is an excellent
help, in case it bend this way; and learning is a genteel ornament, if
not too chargeable: yet, by your leave, they are but estates for the
term of life: but everlasting gold, if well advantaged, will not only
bless thy days, but thy surviving children from generation to
generation. Come, come, let others fill their brains with dear-bought
wit, turn their pence into expenseful charity, and store their bosoms
with unprofitable piety; let them lose all to save their imaginary
consciences, and beggar themselves at home to be thought honest abroad:
fill thou thy bags and barns, and lay up for many years, and take thy
rest. - Francis Quarles, in "The Covetous Man's Care."

[Psa 49:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#006.md)

The form of money agreeth well with the condition of it; for it is
stamped round, because it is so apt to run from a man. Fire, thieves,
waters, and infinite causes there are of consuming riches, and
impoverishing their possessors, though they have even millions and
mountains of gold; but suppose that contrary to their nature they stay
by a man, yet cannot he stay by them, but must leave them in spite of
his teeth, as the Psalmist saith ([Psa
49:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#017).md), "The rich man shall take away
nothing when he dieth, neither shall his pomp follow after him." Thus
death makes a violent divorce between the rich man and his goods, when
it is said unto him, "Thou fool, this night shall they take away thy
soul." The rich man sleeps (saith Job very elegantly), and when he
openeth his eyes there is nothing. It fares with a rich man at his
death, as it doth with a sleeping man when he wakes out of his dream. A
man that dreams of the finding or fruition of some rich booty is
wonderful glad, yet when he awaketh he findeth nothing, but seeth it was
only a dream, and he is sorry; so the rich man seemed in the time of his
life to have somewhat, but at the day of his death all vanisheth like
the idea of a dream, and it vexeth him. - J. D., in "The Threefold
Resolutions," 1608.

[Psa 49:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#006.md)

Who knocks more boldly at heaven-gate to be let in than they whom Christ
will reject as workers of iniquity? Oh, what delusion is this! Caligula
never made himself more ridiculous than when he would be honoured as a
god, while he lived more like a devil. Before you would have others take
you for Christians, for God's sake prove yourselves men and not beasts,
as you do by your brutish lives. Talk not of your hopes of salvation so
long as the marks of damnation are seen upon your flagitious lives. If
the way to heaven were thus easy, I promise you the saints in all ages
have been much overseen, to take so great pains in mortifying their
lusts, in denying to satisfy their sensual appetite. To what purpose did
they make so much waste of their sweat in their zealous serving God? and
of their tears that they could serve him no better, if they might have
gone to heaven as these men hope to do? That friar was far more sound in
his judgment in this point, who, preaching at Rome one Lent, when some
cardinals and many other great ones were present, began his sermon thus
abruptly and ironically. Saint Peter was a fool, Saint Paul was a fool,
and all the primitive Christians were fools; for they thought the way to
heaven was by prayers and tears, watchings and fastings, severities of
mortification, and denying the pomp and glory of this world; whereas you
here in Rome spend your time in balls and masks, live in pomp, and
pride, lust and luxury, and yet count yourselves good Christians, and
hope to be saved; but at last you will prove the fools, and they will be
found to have been the wise men. - William Gurnall's Funeral Sermon for
Lady Mary Vere, 1671.

[Psa 49:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#006.md)

David speaks of some "that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves
in the multitude of their riches." Rich men can do great things, but
here is a thing that they cannot do: "None of them can by any means
redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him." From what cannot
a rich man redeem his brother? It is true of spiritual redemption; yea,
that is furthest out of the rich man's reach money will not do it: "We
are not redeemed with corrupt things, such as silver and gold, but with
the precious blood of the Son of God." [Pe1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018.md), [Pe1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019.md). But the Psalmist speaks of a
lower redemption, to which all the riches of man cannot reach: "None of
them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for
him:" "for the redemption of their soul (that is, of their person from
the grave), is precious, and it ceaseth for ever." And that he speaks of
their redemption from the grave is more clearly expressed at the ninth
verse: "That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption."
Jesus Christ did not so redeem us that we should live for ever, and not
see corruption. It was the privilege of Jesus Christ the Redeemer not to
see corruption; but Jesus Christ hath not redeemed us that we should not
see corruption. He hath redeemed us that we should live for ever in
heaven, but he hath not redeemed us from corruption, that we should live
for ever on earth, or not see corruption in the grave; for, as it is
said in the tenth verse of the Psalm, we see "that wise men die,
likewise the fool and the brutish person perish and leave their wealth
to others;" as if he had said, Neither the one nor the other sort of men
could make this use or improvement of their wealth, to deliver
themselves from going to the grave, for if they could they would have
laid all out on that purchase; but they could not do it, therefore,
"they leave their wealth to others." - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 49:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#007.md)

"None of them can by any means redeem his brother," etc. Some animals
devoted to God could be redeemed at a price, but no price could be
assigned to the ransom of a soul. That such a ransom was to be provided,
the faith of the church had always anticipated' "He shall redeem Israel
from all his iniquities." [Psa 130:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#008.md).
- W. Wilson, D.D.

[Psa 49:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#008.md)

"For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever."
In this judgment tears will not prevail, prayers will not be heard,
promises will not be admitted, repentance will be too late, and as for
riches, honourable titles, sceptres and diadems, these will profit much
less, and the inquisition shall be so curious and diligent, that not one
light thought, not one idle word (not repented of in thy life past)
shall be forgotten, for truth itself hath said, not in jest, but in
earnest, of every idle word which men have spoken, they shall give an
account in the day of judgment. Oh, how many which now sin with great
delight, yea, even with greediness (as if we served a god of wood or of
stone which seeth nothing nor can do nothing) will be then astonished,
ashamed, and silent. Then shall the days of thy mirth be ended, and thou
shalt be overwhelmed with everlasting darkness, and in stead of thy
pleasures thou shalt have everlasting torments. - Thomas Tymme.

[Psa 49:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#008.md)

"For it cost more to redeem their souls: so that he must let that alone
for ever." - Prayer-book Version.

[Psa 49:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#008.md)

"It ceaseth for ever." That is, wealth for ever comes short of the power
necessary to accomplish this. It has always been insufficient; it always
will be. There is no hope that it ever will be sufficient, that by any
increase in the amount, or by any change in the conditions of the
bargain, property or riches can avail for this. The whole matter is
perfectly hopeless as to the power of wealth in saving one human being
from the grave. It must always fail in saving a man from death. The word
rendered ceaseth - חדל, khadal, means to leave off, to desist, to fail.
[Gen 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#008.md); [Exo
9:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#034.md); [Isa
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#022.md). - Albert Barnes.

[Psa 49:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#011.md)

"Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever."
This is the interpretation of our actions, when we do not make God our
portion, but trust in the abundance of our riches; this is our "inward
thought," the saying of our heart, Ye are my god. We do in effect say,
Thou art my confidence, my hope, and my joy, and will stand by me when
all things cease and fail, and wilt not suffer me to want, or to be
wrong, as long as thou lastest: these are the secret speeches of our
hearts. Christians! many may (orator like), declaim against the vanity
of the creature, and speak as basely of money as others do, and say, We
knew it is but a little refined earth; but their hearts close with it,
they are loth to part with it for God's sake, or upon God's declared
will. As he that speaketh good words of God is not said to trust in God;
so speaking bad words of worldly riches doth not exempt us from trusting
them. There is a difference between declaiming as an orator, and acting
like a Christian. - Thomas Manton.

[Psa 49:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#011.md)

"Their inward thought." If good thoughts be thy deep thoughts, if, as we
say, the best at the bottom, thy thoughts are then right, and thou art
righteous; for as the deep thoughts of worldlings are worldly thoughts,
and the deep thoughts of wicked men are wicked thoughts, so the deep
thoughts of good men are good thoughts. 'Tis a notable observation of
the Holy Ghost's concerning worldly men, that "their inward thought is
that their houses shall continue for ever," etc. Why? is there any
thought that is not an inward thought? No, but the meaning is, though
they have some floating thoughts of their mortality, and the vanity and
transitoriness of all worldly things, swimming, as it were, on the top;
yet they do not suffer such thoughts to sink into their hearts, or to go
to the bottom; but the thoughts that lodge there are such as his, who is
said by our Saviour to have thought within himself, "Soul, thou hast
much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be
merry." [Luk 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#019.md). Note the phrase,
"he thought within himself." There are other kinds of thoughts that
sometimes knock at the door of the worldling's heart, nay, sometimes
look in at his windows, as Paul's sermon began to press in upon Felix
his heart, and to set him a-trembling; but there are other thoughts
within, which if they cannot keep good thoughts quite out, they will
keep them off from making any due or deep impression upon the heart.
Now, these thoughts that nestle themselves as it were at the very
heart-roots, to keep others out from reaching thither, these deep
thoughts are they which the Scriptures call the "inward thoughts,"
according to that of the Psalmist ([Psa
64:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#006).md), "The inward thought of every
one of them, and the heart, is deep." - Faithful Teat in "Right Thoughts
the Righteous man's Evidence," 1666.

[Psa 49:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#011.md)

"They call their lands after their own names." God makes fools of them,
for how few have you that go beyond the third generation? How few houses
have you that the child or the grandchild can say, "This was my
grandfather's, and my great grandfather's"? How few houses have you that
those that are now in them can say, "My ancestor dwelt here, and these
were his lands"? Go over a whole country, few can say so. Men when they
build, together with building in the earth, they build castles in the
air; they have conceits. Now I build for my child, and for my child's
child. God crosses them. Either they have no posterity, or by a thousand
things that fall out in the world, it falls out otherwise. The time is
short, and the fashion of this world passeth away; that is, the
buildings pass away, the owning passeth away, all things here pass away;
and, therefore, buy as if you possessed not, buy, so as we neglect not
the best possession in heaven, and so possess these things, as being not
possessed and commanded of them. - Richard Sibbes.

Mr. A was a wealthy farmer in Massachusetts, about sixty years of age,
and it had been his ruling, and almost only passion in life to acquire
property. His neighbour B owned a small farm, which came too near the
centre of A.'s extended domain, was quite a blot in his prospect,
destroyed the regularity of his lands, and on the whole it was really
necessary, in his opinion, that he should add it to his other property.
B became embarassed, and was sued; judgments were obtained, and
executions issued. A now thought he should obtain the land, but one
execution after another was arranged, and finally the debt was paid off
without selling the land. When A heard of the payment of the last
execution, which put an end to his hopes of obtaining the land, he
exclaimed, "Well, B is an old man, and cannot live long, and when he
dies I can buy the lot." B was fifty-eight, A was sixty! Reader, do you
ever expect to die? - K. Arvine's Cyclopaedia of Moral and Religious
Anecdotes.

I have purchased, saith one, such lands, and I have got so good a title
to them, that certainly they will remain mine and my heirs for ever;
never considering how all things here below are subject to ebbings and
flowings, to turns and vicissitudes every day. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 49:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#011.md)

The fleeting nature of all earthly possessions is well illustrated in
the life of William Beckford, and the unenduring character of gorgeous
fabrics in the ruin of his famous Babel, Fonthill Abbey. Byron sang of
Beckford's palace in Spain, in language most applicable to Fonthill: -

"There, too, thou Vathek! England's wealthiest son -

One formed thy Paradise, as not aware

When wanton wealth her mightiest deeds hath done,

Meek Peace voluptuous lures was ever wont to shun.

Here didst thou dwell; here schemes of pleasure plan,

Beneath yon mountain's ever beauteous brow.

But now, as if a thing unblest by man,

Thy fairy dwelling is as lone as thou!

Here giant weeds a passage scarce allow,

To hails deserted portals gaping wide;

Fresh lessons to the thinking bosom, how

Vain are the pleasaunces on earth supplied,

Swept into wrecks anon by Time's ungentle tide!"

C. H. S.

"They call their grounds after their names. But the groundling, in the
midst of splendour, endureth not." In [Psa
49:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#011.md), we have אדמות, "grounds." In
[Psa 49:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#012.md), it is אדם, "groundling,"
with a designed iteration and play upon the word; for want of an
attention to which the passage has not been fully understood. - John

"Man being in honour abideth not." The rabbins read it thus: "Adam being
in honour, lodged not one night." The Hebrew word for abide signifies
"to stay or lodge all night." Adam, then, it seems, did not take up one
night's lodging in Paradise. - Thomas Watson's Body of Divinity.

[Psa 49:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#013.md)

"This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their
sayings." Master Baxter speaks very well of this in his "Saints'
Everlasting Rest," which is a very choice book. The gentry teach their
children to follow pleasure, and the commonalty their children to follow
profit, and young ones are ready to follow old ones. "This their way is
their folly." The very heathen condemn this, and yet Christians mind it
not. Crates the philosopher said, that if possibly he might, he would
willingly mount to the highest place of the city, and there cry aloud in
this manner, "What mean you, my masters, and whither run you headlong?
carking and caring all that ever you can, to gather goods and make
riches as you do, whiles in the meantime you make little or no reckoning
at all of your children, unto whom you are to leave all your riches? Do
not most care more for the wealth of their children's outward man, than
for the health of their inward man?" - J. Votier's Survey of Effectual
Calling, 1652.

[Psa 49:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#013.md)

"This their way is their folly." The folly of man seldom appears more
than in being very busy about nothing, in making a great cry where there
is little wool; like that empty fellow that showed himself to Alexander
- having spent much time, and taken much pains at it beforehand - and
boasted that he could throw a pea through a little hole, expecting a
great reward; but the king gave him only a bushel of peas, for a
recompense suitable to his diligent negligence, or his busy idleness.
Things that are vain and empty are unworthy of our care and industry.
The man that by hard labour and hazard of his life did climb up to the
top of the steeple to set an egg on end, was deservedly the object of
pity and laughter. We shall think him little better than mad that should
make as great a fire for the roasting of an egg as for the roasting of
an ox. - George Swinnock.

[Psa 49:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#013.md)

"Their folly: yet their posterity approve." Dr. Leifchild, in his
"Remarkable Facts," records the following incident, of a person of
property, who had been accustomed regularly to attend his ministry, but
who had always manifested a covetous disposition: "I was sent for to
offer to him the consolation of religion as he lay upon his dying bed.
What was my surprise, after having conversed and prayed with him, to
find that he was unwilling to take my hand, muttering that he knew that
he had not done what was right in reference to the support and
furtherance of religion, but intended to amend in that respect. He then
requested me to say what I thought would become of him. How could I
reply, but by exhorting him to repent, and relinquishing all further
thoughts of a worldly nature, to betake himself to the sacrifice and
mediation of the Son of God for pardon, safety, and salvation in that
world which he was to all appearance soon about to enter? He gazed at me
with a look of disappointment. Upon a hint being given me to inquire
into his thoughts at that moment, I questioned him very pointedly, and
to my astonishment and horror, he reluctantly disclosed to me the fact
that, while thus seemingly about to breathe his last, his hands were
under the bed clothes grasping the keys of his cabinet and treasures,
lest they should be taken from him! Soon after, he departed this life,
and there was, alas I reason to fear that, together with his property,
he had transmitted somewhat of his fatal passion to those who survived
him. It was distressing to me to reflect that a hearer of mine should
quit this world with his fingers stiffened in death around the keys of
his treasures. How strong how terrible, was the ruling passion in the
death of this man!"

[Psa 49:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#014.md)

"Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and
the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their
beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling," or as we put in
the margin, "The grave being an habitation to every one of them, shall
consume their beauty." Some may object, Is not this true of godly men
too? are not they thus handled by death and the grave? doth not death
feed on them? and doth not the grave consume their beauty? I answer,
Though it doth, yet it hath not to feed upon, nor consume them, as it
feeds upon and consumes wicked men. For the Psalmist speaks here of
death as it were triumphing over the wicked whereas the godly triumph
over death. For, first, he saith, The wicked are laid in the grave like
sheep: they lived like wolves or lions, but they are laid in the grave
like sheep. If it be asked, Why like sheep? I answer, not for the
innocency of their lives, but for their impotency in death; as if it had
been said, when once death took them in hand to lay them in the grave,
they could make no more resistance than a sheep can against a lion or a
wolf. And when death hath thus laid them in the grave, then secondly,
saith the Psalmist, "Death shall feed on them," as a lion doth upon a
sheep, or any wild beast upon his prey, which is a further degree of
death's triumph over the wicked. And, thirdly, "Their beauty shall
consume in the grave," that is, all their bodily and natural beauty (and
this is all the beauty which they have) shall consume in the grave,
whereas the godly have a beauty (and they count it their only beauty)
which the grave cannot consume, and that is the beauty of their graces,
the beauty of holiness, the spiritual beauty of the inner man, yea, and
the spiritual beauty of their outward holy actings shall not consume in
the grave; for, "Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from
henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their
labours; and their works do follow them." [Rev
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#013.md). - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 49:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#014.md)

"Death shall feed on them:" rather, "Death shall be their shepherd."
(Sept.) At the end of the foregoing Psalm, the Psalmist had said in the
name of his people, that "God is our God, for ever and ever; he will
lead us as a shepherd over death," and here he takes up the same
pastoral figure, and contrasts with their case the case of the proud and
prosperous worldly men, who trust in their earthly riches and power.
They will not be led in safety, under the pastoral care of God, over
death. No; death itself will be their Shepherd, and the grave will be
their sheep-fold; where they will be laid together like a sheep in a
pen. As Augustine says, "Death is the shepherd of the infidel. Life
(i.e., Christ) is the Shepherd of the faithful." "In inferno sunt oves
quibus pastor Mors est; in caelo sunt oves quibus pastor Vita est." And
so Keble -

Even as a flock arrayed are they

For the dark grave; Death guides their way,

Death is their Shepherd now.

Christopher Wordsworth.

"In the morning," that is, saith Dathe, in the time of judgment. He
thinks there is here an allusion to the usual time of holding courts of
justice, which was in the morning. See [Psa

"Their beauty shall consume in the grave." And now if we do but consider
a little of the tombs and sepulchres of princes and noblemen, whose
glory and majesty we have seen when they lived here on earth, and do
behold the horrible forms and shapes which they now have, shall we not
cry out as men amazed, Is this that glory? Is this that highness and
excellency? Whither now are the degrees of their waiting servants gone?
Where are their ornaments and jewels? Where is their pomp, their
delicacy and niceness? All these things are vanished away like the
smoke, and there is now nothing left but dust, horror, and stink. The
soul being dissolved, there lieth upon the ground not a human body, but
a dead carcase without life, without sense, without strength, and so
fearful to look upon, that the sight thereof may hardly be endured. To
be sure, it is a little better (as touching the substance) than the body
of a horse, or a dog, which lieth dead in the fields, and all that pass
by stop their noses and make haste away, that they be not annoyed with
the sight and stink thereof. Such is man's body now become; yea, and
though it were the body of a monarch, emperor, or a king. Where is that
majesty, that excellency, that authority which he had aforetime when all
men trembled to behold it, and might not come in presence thereof
without all reverence and obeisance? what are all those things become?
were they a dream or shadow? After those things the funeral is prepared,
the which is all that men can carry with them, of all their riches and
kingdom, and this also they should not have, if in their lifetime they
did not appoint it for their dignity and honour. For the prophet David
saith truly ([Psa 49:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#016).md), "Be not thou
afraid though one be made rich, or, if the glory of his house be
increased; for when he dieth he shall carry nothing away with him,
neither shall his pomp follow him." - Thomas Tymme.

[Psa 49:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#014.md)

When we look to a charnel-house, and take a view of the grave, what
amazing and dismal scenes present themselves! How many great and
important images appear! Distracting horrors strike our imagination, and
hideous sounds of diseases, destruction, and death, with all their woful
and black train, terrify us. Ah! the melancholy confused heap of the
ruins of mankind, what a terrible carnage is made of the human race! and
what a solemn and awful theatre of mortality, covered with the
disordered remains of our fellow creatures, presents itself to our
minds! There lie the bones of a proud monarch, who fancied himself a
little god, mingled with the ashes of his poorest subjects! Death seized
him in the height of his vanity, he was just returning from a conquest,
and his haughty mind was swelled with his power and greatness, when one
of these fatal arrows pierced his heart, and at once finished all his
perishing thoughts and contrivances, then the dream of glory vanished,
and all his empire was confined to the grave. Look how pale that
victorious general appears, how dead, and cold, and lifeless these arms
that were once accustomed to war; see if you can discern any difference
betwixt his dust and that of the most despicable slave. Yonder, a
numerous army, once fierce and resolute, whose conquests were rapid as
lightning, and made all the nations to shake for fear of them, are now
so weak that they lie a prey, exposed to the meanest animals, the
loathsome worms, who crawl in triumph over them, and insult their
decayed ruins. There a body that was so much doted on, and solicitously
cared for, and the beauty and shape whereof were so foolishly admired,
now noisome and rotten, nothing but vermin are now fond of it, so
affecting a change hath death made upon it. Look, next to this, upon the
inglorious ashes of a rich, covetous wretch, whose soul was glued to
this world, and hugged itself in its treasures; with what mighty throes
and convulsions did death tear him from this earth? How did his hands
cling to his gold! with what vehement desires did he fasten on his
silver, all of them weak and fruitless! Look now if riches saved him in
that day, if you can perceive any of his useless treasures lying beside
him in the grave, or if the glory of his house have descended after him!
Yonder, an ambitious statesman, his rotten bones are scarce to be
discerned: how did he applaud his artful schemes! how securely did he
think them laid, and flattered himself with the hopes of an established
greatness! but death stepped in, blew them all up at once; this grave is
the whole result of his counsels. And lo, there, what horrid and
suffocating stink ascends from these many hellish sacrifices of lust and
impurity, who wasted their strength in debauch, and carried down with
them nothing but the shame of beastly pleasures to the grave. But there
is no end to the corpses, nor can we survey this terrible field of
death's conquests. - William Dunlop.

"For he shall take me." This short half-verse is, as Bttcher remarks,
the more weighty, from its very shortness. The same expression occurs
again, [Psa 73:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#024.md), "Thou shalt take
me," the original of both being [Gen
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#024.md), where it is used of the
translation of Enoch, "He was not, for God took him." - J. J. Stewart
Perowne.

[Psa 49:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#017.md)

"For when he dieth, he shall carry nothing away." The form of money
agrees well with the condition of it; it is stamped round, because it is
so apt to run away. Could we be rich so long as we live, yet that were
uncertain enough, for life itself is but a dream, a shadow, but a dream
of a shadow. (Augustine.) Rich men are but like hailstones; they make a
noise in the world, as the other rattle on the tiles of a house; down
they fall, lie still, and melt away. So that if riches could stay by a
man, yet he cannot stay by them. Spite of his teeth, he shall carry away
nothing when he dies. Life and goods are both in a vessel, both cast
away at once; yea, of the two, life hath the more likelihood of
continuance. Let if lay never so fast away, riches have eagle's wings,
and will outfly it. There be thieves in the highways, that will take our
moneys and spare our lives. In our penal laws, there be not so many ways
to forfeit our lives as our goods. Rich Job lived to see himself poor to
a proverb. How many in this city reputed rich, yet have broken for
thousands! There are innumerable ways to be poor; a fire, a thief, a
false servant, suretyship, trusting of bad customers, an unfaithful
factor, a pirate, an unskilful pilot, hath brought rich men to poverty.
One gale of wind is able to make merchants rich or beggars. Man's life
is like the banks of a river, his temporal estate is the stream: time
will moulder away the banks, but the stream stays not for that, it
glides away continually. Life is the tree, riches are the fruit, or
rather the leaves; the leaves will fall, the fruit is plucked, and yet
the tree stands. Some write of the pine tree, that if the bark be pulled
off, it lasts long; being on, it rots. If the worldling's bark were
stripped off, he might perhaps live the longer, there is great hope he
would live the better. - Thomas Adams.

"He shall carry nothing away." It is with us in this world, as it was in
the Jewish fields and vineyards: pluck and eat they might what they
would while they were there; but they might not pocket or put up ought
to carry with them. [Deu 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#024.md). -
Thomas Gataker.

[Psa 49:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#017.md)

"He shall carry nothing away." "He hath swallowed down riches, and he
shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly." [Job

[Psa 49:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#017.md)

"Descends." Death takes the sinner by the throat, and "hauls him down
stairs to the grave." The indulgence in any sinful propensity has this
downward, deathly tendency. Every lust, whether for riches or honours,
for gambling, wine, or women, leads the deluded, wretched votary step by
step to the chambers of death. There is no hope in the dread prospect;
trouble and anguish possess the spirit. Hast thou escaped, O my soul,
from the net of the infernal fowler? Never forget that it is as a brand
snatched from the burning. Oh to grace how great a debtor! - George
Offor's note in "The Works of John Bunyan."

[Psa 49:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#017.md)

You will carry none of your riches, fool, to the waters of Acheron.

You will be ferried over quite naked in the infernal boat.

Propertius.

[Psa 49:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#018.md)

How foolish is it to account thyself a better man than another, only
because thy dunghill is a little bigger than his! These things are not
at all to be reckoned into the value and worth of a man: they are all
without thee, and concern thee no more than fine clothes do the health
or strength of the body. It is wealth indeed, that makes all the noise
and bustle in the world, and challengeth all the respect and honour to
itself; and the ignorant vulgar, whose eyes are dazzled with pomp and
bravery, pay it with a stupid and astonished reverence. Yet know, that
it is but thy silks and velvet, thy lands, or thy retinue and servants,
they venerate, not thee: and if thou thinkest otherwise, thou art as
justly ridiculous as that ass in the apologue that grew very gravely
proud, and took state, when the people fell prostrate before him,
adoring, not him, but the idol he carried. - Ezekiel Hopkins.

[Psa 49:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#020.md)

"Like the beasts that perish." My lords, it is no wonder at all, if men
that affect beastly pleasures, and dote upon perishing honours, become
"like the beasts that perish." It is no miracle if he that lives like a
beast dies like a beast. Take a man that hath lived like the fool in the
gospel, and tell me, what hath this man done for his immortal soul more
than a beast doth for its perishing soul? Soul, soul, cease from care,
eat, drink, and take thine ease: this is the constant ditty of most men
in honour: they have studied clothes and victuals, titles and offices,
ways of gain and pleasure. Am I not yet at highest? They have, it may
be, studied the black art of flattery and treachery; they understand the
humour of the times, the compliances and dependences of this and the
other statesman, the projects of divers princes abroad, and the main
design here at home. Is this all? Why then, be it known unto you, that
the men of this strain have made no better provision for their precious
souls, than if they had the soul, the vanishing soul of a beast within
them; and certainly, if we were to judge of the substance of men's souls
by their unworthy and sensual conversation, we might easily fall into
that heresy, that dangerous dream of some who conceive that their souls
are mortal. - Francis Cheynell, in a Sermon entitled, "The Man of
Honour,".... preached before the Lords of Parliament, 1645.

[Psa 49:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#020.md)

"Like the beasts that perish." Sin is both formaliter and effective
vile. As it is so in itself, so it has made man vile. No creature so
debased as man, being in this respect become viler than any creature.
There is no such depravation in the nature of any creature, except in
the diabolical nature. No creature ever razed God's image out of its
nature, but only man. There is no aversions to the will of God, no
inclination to what offends him, in any creature on earth but man. Man,
then, who was once the glory of the creation, is become the vilest of
all creatures, for that is vilest which is most contrary to the infinite
glory, but so is our nature, "Man being in honour, abideth not," is now
"like the beasts that perish;" nay, worse than they, if the greatest
evil can make him worse. Man was made a little lower than the angels,
crowned with glory, advanced to be lord and governor of all the works of
his hands; and all creatures in this world were put under his feet. [Psa
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#005.md), [Psa
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#006.md). But by this natural corruption he
that was but a little lower than angels is now something below the
beasts. He was to have dominion, but is made baser than those over whom
he rules. They were put under his feet, but now he is as low as they.
This is the sad issue of natural corruption. - David Clarkson.

[Psa 49:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#020.md)

"Like the beasts." Man is so much a beast, that he cannot know himself
to be one till God teach him. And we never learn to be men till we have
learned that we were beasts.... It is not said he is like this or that
beast, but "he is like the beasts that perish." Take any beast, or all
beasts, the worst of beasts, he is the picture of them all, and he daily
exemplifies the vilest of their qualities in his own. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psalms 49:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 49:1</span></span>

1 Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world;

2 Both low and high, rich and poor, together.

3 My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall
be of understanding.

4 I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon
the harp.

In these four verses the poet-prophet calls universal humanity to listen
to his didactic hymn.

[Psa 49:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#001.md)

"Hear this, all ye people." All men are concerned in the subject, it is
of them, and therefore to them that the Psalmist would speak. It is not
a topic which men delight to consider, and therefore he who would
instruct them must press them to give ear. Where, as in this case, the
theme claims to be wisdom and understanding, attention is very properly
demanded; and when the style combines the sententiousness of the proverb
with the sweetness of poesy, interest is readily excited. "Give ear, all
ye inhabitants of the world." "He that hath ears to hear let him hear."
Men dwelling in all climes are equally concerned in the subject, for the
laws of providence are the same in all lands. It is wise for each one to
feel I am a man, and therefore everything which concerns mortals has a
personal interest to me. We must all appear before the judgment-seat,
and therefore we all should give earnest heed to holy admonition which
may help us to prepare for that dread event. He who refuses to receive
instruction by the ear, will not be able to escape receiving destruction
by it when the Judge shall say, "Depart, ye cursed."

[Psa 49:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#002.md)

"Both low and high, rich and poor, together." Sons of great men, and
children of mean men, men of large estate, and ye who pine in poverty,
ye are all bidden to hear the inspired minstrel as he touches his harp
to a mournful but instructive lay. The low will be encouraged, the high
will be warned, the rich will be sobered, the poor consoled, there will
be a useful lesson for each if they are willing to learn it. Our
preaching ought to have a voice for all classes, and all should have an
ear for it. To suit our word to the rich alone is wicked sycophancy, and
to aim only at pleasing the poor is to act the part of a demagogue.
Truth may be so spoken as to command the ear of all, and wise men seek
to learn that acceptable style. Rich and poor must soon meet together in
the grave, they may well be content to meet together now. In the
congregation of the dead all differences of rank will be obliterated,
they ought not now to be obstructions to united instructions.

[Psa 49:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#003.md)

"My mouth shall speak of wisdom." Inspired and therefore lifted beyond
himself, the prophet is not praising his own attainments, but extolling
the divine Spirit which spoke in him. He knew that the Spirit of truth
and wisdom spoke through him. He who is not sure that his matter is good
has no right to ask a hearing. "And the meditation of my heart shall be
of understanding." The same Spirit who made the ancient seers eloquent,
also made them thoughtful. The help of the Holy Ghost was never meant to
supersede the use of our own mental powers. The Holy Spirit does not
make us speak as Balaam's ass, which merely uttered sounds, but never
meditated; but he first leads us to consider and reflect, and then he
gives us the tongue of fire to speak with power.

[Psa 49:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#004.md)

"I will incline mine ear to a parable." He who would have others hear,
begins by hearing himself. As the minstrel leans his ear to his harp, so
must the preacher give his whole soul to his ministry. The truth came to
the Psalmist as a parable, and he endeavoured to unriddle it for popular
use; he would not leave the truth in obscurity, but he listened to its
voice till he so well understood it as to be able to interpret and
translate it into the common language of the multitude. Still of
necessity it would remain a problem, and a dark saying to the
unenlightened many, but this would not be the songster's fault, for,
saith he, "I will open my dark saying upon the harp." The writer was no
mystic, delighting in deep and cloudy things, yet he was not afraid of
the most profound topics; he tried to open the treasures of darkness,
and to uplift pearls from the deep. To win attention he cast his
proverbial philosophy into the form of song, and tuned his harp to the
solemn tone of his subject. Let us gather round the minstrel of the King
of kings, and hear the Psalm which erst was led by the chief musician,
as the chorus of the sons of Korah lifted up their voices in the temple.

[Psalms 49:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 49:5</span></span>

5 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my
heels shall compass me about?

6 They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude
of their riches;

7 None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a
ransom for him:

8 (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for
ever:)

9 That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.

10 For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish
person perish, and leave their wealth to others.

11 Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever,
and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands
after their own names.

12 Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts
that perish.

[Psa 49:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#005.md)

"Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my
heels shall compass me about?" The man of God looks calmly forward to
dark times when those evils which have dogged his heels shall gain a
temporary advantage over him. Iniquitous men, here called in the
abstract iniquity, lie in wait for the righteous, as serpents that aim
at the heels of travellers the iniquity of our heels is that evil which
aims to trip us up or impede us. It was an old prophecy that the serpent
should wound the heel of the woman's seed, and the enemy of our souls is
diligent to fulfil that premonition. In some dreary part of our road it
may be that evil will wax stronger and bolder, and gaining upon us will
openly assail us; those who followed at our heels like a pack of wolves,
may perhaps overtake us, and compass us about. What then? Shall we yield
to cowardice? Shall we be a prey to their teeth? God forbid. Nay, we
will not even fear, for what are these foes? What indeed, but mortal men
who shall perish and pass away? There can be no real ground of alarm to
the faithful. Their enemies are too insignificant to be worthy of one
thrill of fear. Doth not the Lord say to us, "I, even I, am he that
comforteth thee: who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man
that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as grass?"

Scholars have given other renderings of this verse, but we prefer to
keep to the authorised version when we can, and in this case we find in
it precisely the same meaning which those would give to it who translate
"my heels," by the words, "my supplanters."

[Psa 49:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#006.md)

What if the good man's foes be among the great ones of the earth! yet he
need not fear them. "They that trust in their wealth." Poor fools, to be
content with such a rotten confidence. When we set our rock in contrast
with theirs, it would be folly to be afraid of them. Even though they
are loud in their brags, we can afford to smile. What if they glory "and
boast themselves in the multitude of their riches"? yet while we glory
in our God we are not dismayed by their proud threatenings. Great
strength, position, and estate, make wicked men very lofty in their own
esteem, and tyrannical towards others; but the heir of heaven is not
overawed by their dignity, nor cowed by their haughtiness. He sees the
small value of riches, and the helplessness of their owners in the hour
of death, and therefore he is not so mean as to be afraid of an
ephemera, a moth, a bubble.

[Psa 49:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#007.md)

"None of them can by any means redeem his brother." With all their
riches, the whole of them put together could not rescue a comrade from
the chill grasp of death. They boast of what they will do with us, let
them see to themselves. Let them weigh their gold in the scales of
death, and see how much they can buy therewith from the worm and the
grave. The poor are their equals in this respect; let them love their
friend ever so dearly, they cannot "give to God a reason for him. A
king's ransom would be of no avail, a Monte Rosa of rubies, an America
of silver, a world of gold, a sun of diamonds, would all be utterly
contemned. O ye boasters, think not to terrify us with your worthless
wealth, go ye and intimidate death before ye threaten men in whom is
immortality and life.

[Psa 49:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#008.md)

"For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever."
Too great is the price, the purchase is hopeless. For ever must the
attempt to redeem a soul with money remain a failure. Death comes and
wealth cannot bribe him; hell follows, and no golden key can unlock its
dungeons. Vain, then, are your threatenings, ye possessors of the yellow
clay; your childish toys are despised by men who estimate the value of
possessions by the shekel of the sanctuary.

[Psa 49:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#009.md)

No price could secure for any man "That he should still live for ever,
and not see corruption." Mad are men now after gold, what would they be
if it could buy the elixir of immortality? Gold is lavished out of the
bag to cheat the worm of the poor body by embalming it, or enshrining it
in a coffin of lead, but it is a miserable business, a very burlesque
and comedy. As for the soul, it is too subtle a thing to be detained
when it hears the divine command to soar through tracks unknown. Never,
therefore, will we fear, those base nibblers at our heels, whose boasted
treasure proves to be so powerless to save.

[Psa 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#010.md)

"For he seeth that wise men die." Every one sees this. The proud,
persecuting rich man cannot help seeing it. He cannot shut his eyes to
the fact that wiser men than he are dying, and that he also, with all
his craft, must die. "Like wise the fool and the brutish person perish."
Folly has no immunity from death. Off goes the jester's cap, as well as
the student's gown. Jollity cannot laugh off the dying hour; death who
visits the university, does not spare the tavern. Thoughtlessness and
brutishness meet their end as surely as much care and wasting study. In
fact, while the truly wise, so far as this world is concerned, die, the
fool has a worse lot, for he perishes, is blotted out of remembrance,
bewailed by none, remembered no more. "And leave their wealth to
others.'" Not a farthing can they carry with them. Whether heirs male of
their own body, lawfully begotten, inherit their estates, or they remain
unclaimed, it matters not, their hoardings are no longer theirs; friends
may quarrel over their property, or strangers divide it as spoil, they
cannot interfere. Ye boasters, hold ye your own, before ye dream of
despoiling the sons of the living God. Keep shoes to your own feet in
death's dark pilgrimage, ere ye seek to bite our heels.

[Psa 49:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#011.md)

"Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and
their dwelling places to all generations." He is very foolish who is
more a fool in his inmost thought than he dare be in his speech. Such
rotten fruit, rotten at the core, are worldlings. Down deep in their
hearts, though they dare not say so, they fancy that earthly goods are
real and enduring. Foolish dreamers! The frequent dilapidations of their
castles and manor-houses should teach them better, but still they
cherish the delusion. They cannot tell the mirage from the true streams
of water; they fancy rainbows to be stable, and clouds to be the
everlasting hills. "They call their lands after their own names." Common
enough is this practice. His grounds are made to bear the groundling's
name, he might as well write it on the water. Men have even called
countries by their own names, but what are they better for the idle
compliment, even if men perpetuate their nomenclature?

[Psa 49:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#012.md)

"Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not." He is but a lodger for
the hour, and does not stay a night: even when he dwells in marble halls
his notice to quit is written out. Eminence is evermore in imminence of
peril. The hero of the hour lasts but for an hour. Sceptres fall from
the paralysed hands which once grasped them, and coronets slip away from
skulls when the life is departed. "He is like the beasts that perish."
He is not like the sheep which are preserved of the Great Shepherd, but
like the hunted beast which is doomed to die. He lives a brutish life
and dies a brutish death. Wallowing in riches, surfeited with pleasure,
he is fatted for the slaughter, and dies like the ox in the shambles.
Alas! that so noble a creature should use his life so unworthily, and
end it so disgracefully. So far as this world is concerned, wherein does
the death of many men differ from the death of a dog? They go down -

"To the vile dust from whence they sprung,

Unwept, unhonour'd, and unsung."

What room is there, then, for fear to the godly when such natural brute
beasts assail them? Should they not in patience possess their souls?

We make a break here, because this stanza appears to be the refrain of
the song, and as such is repeated in the [Psa
49:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#020.md).

[Psalms 49:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 49:13</span></span>

13 This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their
sayings. Selah.

Their vain confidences are not casual aberrations from the path of
wisdom but their way, their usual and regular course; their whole life
is regulated by such principles. Their life-path is essential folly.
They are fools ingrain. From first to last brutishness is their
characteristic, grovelling stupidity the leading trait of their conduct.
"Yet their posterity approve their sayings." Those who follow them in
descent follow them in folly, quote their worldly maxims, and accept
their mad career as the most prudent mode of life. Why do they not see
by their fathers' failure their fathers' folly? No, the race transmits
its weakness. Grace is not hereditary, but sordid worldliness goes from
generation to generation. The race of fools never dies out. No need of
missionaries to teach men to be earthworms, they crawl naturally to the
dust. "Selah." Well may the minstrel pause, and bid us muse upon the
deep-seated madness of the sons of Adam. Take occasion, reader, to
reflect upon thine own.

[Psalms 49:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 49:14</span></span>

14 Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and
the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their
beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.

15 But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave; for he shall
receive me. Selah.

[Psa 49:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#014.md)

"Like sheep they are laid in the grave." As dumb, driven cattle, they
are hurried to their doom, and are penned in within the gates of
destruction. As sheep that go whither they are driven, and follow their
leader without thought, so these men who have chosen to make this world
their all, are urged on by their passions, till they find themselves at
their journey's end, that end the depths of Hades. Or if we keep to our
own translation, we have the idea of their dying peaceably, and being
buried in quiet, only that they may wake up to be ashamed at the last
great day. "Death shall feed on them." Death like a grim shepherd leads
them on, and conducts them to the place of their eternal pasturage,
where all is barrenness and misery. The righteous are led by the Good
Shepherd, but the ungodly have death for their shepherd, and he drives
them onward to hell. As the power of death rules them in this world, for
they have not passed from death unto life, so the terrors of death shall
devour them in the world to come. As grim giants, in old stories, are
said to feed on men whom they entice to their caves, so death, the
monster, feeds on the flesh and blood of the mighty. "The upright shall
have dominion over them in the morning." The poor saints were once the
tail, but at the day-break they shall be the head. Sinners rule till
night-fall; their honours wither in the evening, and in the morning they
find their position utterly reversed. The sweetest reflection to the
upright is that "the morning" here intended begins an endless,
changeless, day. What a vexation of spirit to the proud worldling, when
the Judge of all the earth holds his morning session, to see the man
whom he despised, exalted high in heaven, while he himself is cast away!
"And their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling."
Whatever of glory the ungodly had shall disappear in the tomb. Form and
comeliness shall vanish from them, the worm shall make sad havoc of all
their beauty. Even their last dwelling place, the grave, shall not be
able to protect the relics committed to it; their bodies shall dissolve,
no trace shall remain of all their strong limbs and lofty heads, no
vestige of remaining beauty shall be discoverable. The beauty of the
righteous is not yet revealed, it waits its manifestations; but all the
beauty the wicked will ever have is in full bloom in this life; it will
wither, fade, decay, rot, and utterly pass away. Who, then, would envy
or fear the proud sinner?

[Psa 49:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#015.md)

"But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave." Forth from
that temporary resting-place we shall come in due time, quickened by
divine energy. Like our risen Head we cannot be holden by the bands of
the grave; redemption has emancipated us from the slavery of death. No
redemption could man find in riches, but God has found it in the blood
of his dear Son. Our Elder Brother has given to God a ransom, and we are
the redeemed of the Lord: because of this redemption by price we shall
assuredly be redeemed by power out of the hand of the last enemy. "For
he shall receive me." He shall take me out of the tomb, take me up to
heaven. If it is not said of me as of Enoch, "He was not, for God took
him," yet shall I reach the same glorious state. My spirit God will
receive, and my body shall sleep in Jesus till, being raised in his
image, it shall also be received into glory. How infinitely superior is
such a hope to anything which our oppressors can boast! Here is
something which will bear meditation, and therefore again let us pause,
at the bidding of the musician, who inserts a "Selah."

[Psalms 49:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 49:16</span></span>

16 Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house
is increased;

17 For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not
descend after him.

18 Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise thee,
when thou doest well to thyself.

19 He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see
light.

20 Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that
perish.

[Psa 49:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#016.md)

In these last verses the Psalmist becomes a preacher, and gives
admonitory lessons which he has himself gathered from experience. "Be
not thou afraid when one is made rich." Let it not give thee any concern
to see the godless prosper. Raise no questions as to divine justice;
suffer no foreboding to cloud thy mind. Temporal prosperity is too small
a matter to be worth fretting about; let the dogs have their bones, and
the swine their draft. "When the glory of his house is increased."
Though the sinner and his family are in great esteem, and stand
exceedingly high, never mind; all things will be righted in due time.
Only those whose judgment is worthless will esteem men the more because
their lands are broader; those who are highly estimated for such
unreasonable reasons will find their level ere long, when truth and
righteousness come to the fore.

[Psa 49:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#017.md)

"For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away." He has but a leasehold
of his acres, and death ends his tenure. Through the river of death man
must pass naked. Not a rag of all his raiment, not a coin of all his
treasure, not a jot of all his honour, can the dying worldling carry
with him. Why then fret ourselves about so fleeting a prosperity? "His
glory shall not descend after him." As he goes down, down, down for
ever, none of his honours or possessions will follow him. Patents of
nobility are invalid in the sepulchre. His worship, his honour, his
lordship, and his grace, will alike find their titles ridiculous in the
tomb. Hell knows no aristocracy. Your dainty and delicate sinners shall
find that eternal burnings have no respect for their affectations and
refinements.

[Psa 49:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#018.md)

"Though while he lived he blessed his soul." He pronounced himself
happy. He had his good things in this life. His chief end and aim were
to bless himself. He was charmed with the adulations of flatterers. "Men
will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself." The generality of
men worship success, however it may be gained. The colour of the winning
horse is no matter; it is the winner, and that is enough. "Take care of
Number One," is the world's proverbial philosophy, and he who gives good
heed to it is "a clever fellow," "a fine man of business," "a shrewd
common-sense tradesman," "a man with his head put on the right way," Get
money, and you will be "respectable," "a substantial man," and your
house will be "an eminent firm in the city," or "one of our best county
families." To do good wins fame in heaven, but to do good to yourself is
the prudent thing among men of the world. Yet not a whisper of worldly
congratulation can follow the departing millionaire; they say he died
worth a mint of money, but what charm has that fact to the dull cold ear
of death? The banker rots as fast as the shoe-black, and the peer
becomes as putrid as the pauper. Alas! poor wealth, thou art but the
rainbow colouring of the bubble, the tint which yellows the morning
mist, but adds no substance to it.

[Psa 49:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#019.md)

"He shall go to the generation of his fathers." Where the former
generations lie, the present shall also slumber. The sires beckon to
their sons to come to the land of forgetfulness. Mortal fathers beget
not immortal children. As our ancestors have departed, so also must we.
"They shall never see light." To this upper region the dead worldling
shall never return again to possess his estates, and enjoy his
dignities. Among the dead he must lie in the thick darkness, where no
joy or hope can come to him. Of all his treasures their remains not
enough to furnish him one poor candle; the blaze of his glory is out
forever, and not a spark remains to cheer him. How then can we look with
fear or envy upon a wretch doomed to such unhappiness?

[Psa 49:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#020.md)

The song ends with the refrain, "Man that is in honour, and
understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish." Understanding
differences men from animals, but if they will not follow the highest
wisdom, and like beasts find their all in this life, then their end
shall be as mean and dishonourable as that of beasts slain in the chase,
or killed in the shambles. From the loftiest elevation of worldly honour
to the uttermost depth of death is but a step. Saddest of all is the
reflection, that though men are like beasts in all the degradation of
perishing, yet not in the rest which animal perishing secures, for,
alas! it is written, "These shall go away into everlasting punishment."

So ends the minstrel's lay. Comforting as the theme is to the righteous,
it is full of warning to the worldly. Hear ye it, O ye rich and poor.
Give ear to it, ye nations of the earth.
