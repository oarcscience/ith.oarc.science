### [Psalms Chapter 70](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 70:0</span></span>

Title - To the Chief Musician, a Psalm of David. - So far the title
corresponds with Psalm 40, of which this is a copy with variations.
David appears to have Written the full-length Psalm, and also to have
made this excerpt from it, and altered it to suit the occasion. It is a
fit-pendant to Psalm 69, and a suitable preface to Psalm 71. To bring to
remembrance. This is the poor man's memorial. David personally pleads
with God that he may not be forgotten, but David's Lord may be heard
here also. Even if the Lord seems to forget us, we must not forget him.
This memorial Psalm acts as a connecting link between the two Psalms of
supplicatory expostulation, and makes up with them a precious triad of
song.

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Whole Psalm

Francke would apply the present Psalm to the state of the Christian
church after the resurrection and exaltation of Christ, and would put
the words in the mouths of the faithful of that time. On the same ground
of transferring the language adapted to Christ in Psalm 40 to the
faithful in this Psalm, we need not hesitate to take them on our lips,
as the language of the church in every age. I cannot but reassert my
conviction of the intentional arrangement of the Psalms in the order in
which we now have them made in all probability, partially at least, at
the time they were handed over to public use. It is surely a daring
conjecture made by Walford, that the repetition of this Psalm arose from
some mistake of the persons by whom the Psalms were collected and
arranged, after the return from the captivity in Babylon. - W. Wilson.

[Psa 70:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#002.md)

"Let them be confounded;" viz., among themselves, and in their own
understandings: "and put to shame;" viz., in the sight and presence of
men before whom they think to attain great glory, in banding themselves
against me. - Thomas Wilcocks.

[Psa 70:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#003.md)

"Aha, aha." In describing his human foes, our Saviour represents them as
saying to him, "Aha, aha." These exclamations are ebullitions of
exulting insolence. They can escape from the lips of those only who are
at once haughty and cruel, and insensible to the delicacies and decorums
of demeanour. Doubtless, they would be the favourite expressions of the
rude rabble that accompanied the traitor in his ignoble campaign against
Incarnate Love, and of the rude aristocratic mob that held over the
Apostle of Heaven the mockery of an ecclesiastical trial, and of the
larger, more excited, and more rancorous multitude that insultingly
accompanied him to the cross, and mocked him, and wagged their heads at
him, and rafted upon him as he meekly, but majestically, hung on the
accursed tree. The prescient Saviour would, no doubt, catch in his ears
the distant mutter of all the violent and ruthless exclamations with
which his foes were about to rend the air; and, amid these heartless and
sneering ejaculations, he could not but feel the keen and poisoning edge
of the malevolent and hilarious cry, "Aha, aha." O miracle of mercy! He
who deserved the hallelujahs of an intelligent universe, and the special
hosannahs of all the children of men, had first to anticipate, and then
to endure from the mouths of the very rebels whom he came to bless and
to save, the malicious tauntings of "Aha, aha." - James Frame.

[Psa 70:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#004.md)

"Such as love thy salvation." They love it for its own sake; they love
it for the sake of him who procured it by his obedience unto death; they
love it for the sake of that Holy Spirit who moved them to seek it and
accept it; and they love it for the sake of their own souls, which they
cannot but love, and which, without it, would be the most miserable
outcasts in the universe. No wonder that in the light of its intrinsic
importance, and of its intrinsic relations, they should be "such as love
God's salvation." All men are lovers as well as seekers; for all men
love. Some love money more than God's salvation; others love pleasure,
even the pleasures of sin, more than God's salvation; and others love
bustle and business more than God's salvation. But, as the stamp of the
material, the temporal and the evanescent, is on all these earthly
objects of men's love, the friends of Jesus elevate above them all, as
the worthier object of their regard and embrace, the salvation of God. -
James Frame.

[Psa 70:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#004.md)

"Let God be magnified." Not only "The Lord be magnified." but also
"alway." Behold, when thou wast straying, and wast turned away from him;
he recalled thee: Be the Lord magnified. Behold, he hath inspired thee
with confession of sins; thou hast confessed, he hath given pardon: Be
the Lord magnified ... Now, thou hast begun to advance, thou hast been
justified, thou hast arrived at a sort of excellence of virtue; is it
not a seemly thing that thou also sometime be magnified? No I let them
say, Be the Lord alway magnified. A sinner thou art, be he magnified in
order that he may call; thou confessest, be he magnified in order that
he may forgive: now thou livest justly, be he magnified in order that he
may direct; thou perseverest even unto the end, be he magnified in order
that he may glorify. Be the Lord, then, alway magnified. Let just men
say this, let them say this that seek him. Whosoever doth not say this,
doth not seek him ... Be the Lord magnified. But, wilt thou thyself
never be great? wilt thou be nowhere? In him was something, in me
nothing; but if in him is whatsoever I am, be he magnified, not I. But,
what of these? "But I am poor and needy:" he is rich, he abounding, he
needing nothing. Behold my light, behold whence I am illumined, for I
cry, "Thou shalt illumine my candle, O Lord; my God, thou shalt illumine
my darkness. The Lord doth loose men lettered, the Lord raiseth up men
crushed, the Lord maketh wise the blind men, the Lord keepeth the
proselytes." [Psa 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#028.md); [Psa
146:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#007.md). What, then, of thee? "But I am
needy and poor." I am like an orphan, my soul is like a widow destitute
and desolate; help I seek, alway mine infirmity I confess. "But I am
poor and needy." There have been forgiven me my sins, now I have begun
to follow the commandments of God; still, however, I am needy and poor.
Why still needy and poor? Because I see another law in my members
fighting against the law of my mind. [Rom
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#023.md). Why needy and poor? Because,
"Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteous- [Mat
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#006.md). Still I hunger, still I thirst."
- Augustine.

[Psa 70:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#005.md)

"But I am poor and needy." He had been rich, but for our sake he had
become poor, that we, through his poverty, might be rich. Out of the
fulness of his grace he had voluntarily entered, for our sakes, into a
state in which he had experience, and most bitter experience, of the
want of the means of enjoyment ... But the word here rendered "poor" is
often, elsewhere, translated afflicted; in various ways he was
afflicted. He was despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows, and
the acquaintance of grief. He was reproached, and "reproach broke his
heart." - James Frame.

[Psa 70:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#005.md)

"I am poor and needy." By this I hold to be meant the chastisements, and
fiery trials that come from God the Father; the temptations and bitter
assaults of that foul and fell fiend, Satan; the persecutions and
vexations inflicted by the hands of unreasonable and wicked men; and
(but in this following Christ must be exempted) the inward corruptions,
disordered motions, unsettled affections, and the original pollutions
brought from the mother's womb; with the soul and body's inaptness and
unableness with cheerfulness and constancy to run the direct and just
paths of God's commandments. Many of these made the Head, all of these
(and more, too) the members, "poor and needy." - John Barlow. 1618.

[Psa 70:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#005.md)

"O Lord, make no tarrying." His prayer for himself, like his prayer for
his foes and for his friends, was answered. The Lord made no tarrying.
Ere four and twenty hours had rolled past, his rescued spirit was in
Paradise, and the crucified thief was with him. O what a change! The
morning saw him condemned at the bar of an earthly tribunal, sentenced
to death, and nailed to the bitter tree; before the evening shadowed the
hill of Calvary, he was nestling in the bosom of God, and had become the
great centre of attraction and of admiration to all the holy
intelligences of the universe. The morning saw him led out through the
gate of the Jerusalem below, surrounded by a ribald crowd, whose
hootings rung in his ear; but ere the night fell, he had passed through
the gate of the Jerusalem above, and his tread was upon the streets of
gold, and angel anthems rose high through the dome of heaven, and joy
filled the heart of God. - James Frame.

[Psa 70:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#005) (third clause.md)

"Helper," in all good works; "Deliverer," from all evil ones. "Make no
long tarrying:" it is the cry of the individual sinner. - Dionysius the
Carthusian (1471), quoted in Neale and Littledale's Commentary.

[Psalms 70:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 70:1</span></span>

1 Make haste, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O Lord.

2 Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them
be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.

3 Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha,
aha.

4 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such
as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.

5 But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art my help
and my deliverer; O Lord, make no tarrying.

[Psa 70:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#001.md)

This is the second Psalm which is a repetition of another, the former
being [Psa 53:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001.md), which was a
rehearsal of [Psa 14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md). The present
differs from [Psa 40:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#013.md) at the
outset, for that begins with, "Be pleased," and this, in our version,
more urgently with, "Make haste;" or, as in the Hebrew, with an abrupt
and broken cry, "O God, to deliver me; O Lord, to help me hasten." It is
not forbidden us, in hours of dire distress, to ask for speed on God's
part in his coming to rescue us. The only other difference between this
and [Psa 40:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#013.md), is the putting of
Elohim in the beginning of the verse for Jehovah, but why this is done,
we know not; perhaps, the guesses of the critics are correct, but
perhaps they are not. As we have the words of this Psalm twice in the
letter, let them be doubly with us in spirit. It is most meet that we
should day by day cry to God for deliverance and help; our frailty and
our many dangers render this a perpetual necessity.

[Psa 70:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#002.md)

Here the words, "together," and, "to destroy it," which occur in Psalm
40 are omitted: a man in haste uses no more words than are actually
necessary. His enemies desired to put his faith to shame, and he eagerly
entreats that they may be disappointed, and themselves covered with
confusion. It shall certainly be so; if not sooner, yet at that dread
day When the wicked shall awake to shame and everlasting contempt. "Let
them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be
turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt;" turned back
and driven back are merely the variations of the translators, When men
labour to turn others back from the right road, it is God's retaliation
to drive them back from the point they are aiming at.

[Psa 70:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#003.md)

"Let them be turned back." This is a milder term than that used in Psalm
40, where he cries, "let them be desolate." Had growing years matured
and mellowed the Psalmist's spirit? To be "turned back," however, may
come to the same thing as to be "desolate;" disappointed malice is the
nearest akin to desolation that can well be conceived. "For a reward of
their shame that say, Aha, aha." They thought to shame the godly, but it
was their shame, and shall be their shame for ever. How fond men are of
taunts, and if they are meaningless "Ahas," more like animal cries than
human words, it matters nothing, so long as they are a vent for scorn
and sting the victim. Rest assured, the enemies of Christ and his people
shall have wages for their work; they shall be paid in their own coin;
they loved scoffing, and they shall be filled with it - yea, they shall
become a proverb and a by-word for ever.

[Psa 70:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#004.md)

Anger against enemies must not make us forget our friends, for it is
better to preserve a single citizen of Zion, than to kill a thousand
enemies. "Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee." All
true worshippers, though as yet in the humble ranks of seekers, shall
have cause for joy. Even though the seeking commence in darkness, it
shall bring light with it. "And let such as love thy salvation say
continually, Let God be magnified" Those who have tasted divine grace,
and are therefore, wedded to it, are a somewhat more advanced race, and
these shall not only feel joy, but shall with holy constancy and
perseverance tell abroad their joy, and call upon men to glorify God.
The doxology, "Let the Lord's name be magnified," is infinitely more
manly and ennobling than the dog's bark of "Aha, aha."

[Psa 70:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#005.md)

"But I am poor and needy." Just the same plea as in [Psa
69:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#029.md), it seems to be a favourite
argument with tried saints; evidently our poverty is our wealth, even as
our weakness is our strength. May we learn well this riddle. "Make haste
unto me, O God." This is written instead of "yet the Lord thinketh upon
me," in Psalm 40: and there is a reason for the change, since the key
note of the Psalm frequently dictates its close. Psalm 40 sings of God's
thoughts, and, therefore, ends therewith; but the peculiar note of [Psa
70:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#001.md) is "Make haste," and,
therefore, so it concludes. "Thou art my help and my deliverer." My help
in trouble, my deliverer out of it. "O Lord, make no tarrying." Here is
the name of "Jehovah" instead of "my God." We are warranted in using all
the various names of God, for each has its own beauty and majesty, and
we must reverence each by its holy use as well as by abstaining from
taking it in vain. I have presumed to close this recapitulatory
exposition with an original hymn, suggested by the watchword of this
Psalm, "Make Haste."

Make haste, O God, my soul to bless!

My help and my deliv'rer thou;

Make haste, for I'm in deep distress,

My case is urgent: help me now.

Make haste, O God! make haste to save!

For time is short, and death is nigh;

Make haste ere yet I'm in my grave,

And with the lost for ever lie.

Make haste; for I am poor and low;

And Satan mocks my prayers and tears;

O God, in mercy be not slow,

But snatch me from my horrid fears.

Make haste, O God, and hear my cries;

Then with the souls who seek thy face,

And those who thy salvation prize,

I'll magnify thy matchless grace.
