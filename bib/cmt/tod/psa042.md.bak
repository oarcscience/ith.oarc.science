[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 42:0</span></span>

Title - To the Chief Musician, Maschil, for the sons of Korah -
Dedicated to the Master of Music, this Psalm is worthy of his office; he
who can sing best can have nothing better to sing. It is called Maschil
or an instructive ode; and' full as it is of deep experimental
expressions, it is eminently calculated to instruct those pilgrims whose
road to heaven is of the same trying kind as David's was. It is always
edifying to listen to the experience of a thoroughly gracious and much
afflicted saint.

That choice band of singers, the sons of Korah, are bidden to make this
delightful Psalm one of their peculiars. They had been spared when their
father and all his company, and all the children of his associates were
swallowed up alive in their sin. ([Num
27:11](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#011).md). They were the spared ones of
sovereign grace. Preserved, we know not why, by the distinguishing
favour of God, it may be surmised that after their remarkable election
to mercy, they became so filled with gratitude that they addicted
themselves to sacred music in order that their spared lives might be
consecrated to the glory of God. At any rate, we who have been rescued
as they were from going down into the pit, out of the mere' good
pleasure of Jehovah, can heartily join in this Psalm, and indeed all the
songs which show forth the praises of our God and the puntings of our
hearts after him. Although David is not mentioned as the author, this
Psalm must be the offspring of his pen; it is so Davidic, it smells of
the son of Jesse, it bears the marks of his style and experience in
every letter. We could sooner doubt the author-ship of the second part
of Pilgrim's Progress than question David's title to be the composer of
this Psalm.

Subject - It is the cry of a man far removed from the outward ordinances
and worship of God, sighing for the long-loved house of his God; and at
the same time it is the voice of a spiritual believer, under
depressions, longing for the renewal of the divine presence, struggling
with doubts and fears, but yet holding his ground by faith in the living
God. Most of the Lord's family have sailed on the sea which is here so
graphically described. It is probable that David's flight from Absolom
may have been the occasion for composing this Maschil.

Division - The structure of the song directs us to consider it in two
parts which end with the same refrain; [Psa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md)and then [Psa
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#006.md).

Hints to Preachers

[Psa 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md) - The longing heart and the
panting hart compared.

[Psa 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md), [Psa
42:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#002.md) - Those who have enjoyed the
presence of God in the public ordinances of religion will greatly
desire, if deprived of them, to be favoured with them again....
Prevention from attending the public ordinances of God's house may be
made the means of great benefit to the soul.

I. By renewing our relish for the provisions of the Lord's house, which
so soon and so often palls.

II\. By making us to prize the means of grace more highly. There is,
through human degeneracy, a proneness to value things less, however
excellent in themselves, because of their being common, or plentiful, or
of easy attainment.

III\. By driving us more directly from God.

\- H. March.

[Psa 42:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md) - The home-sickness of the
soul. What awakens it in the soul? To what is it directed, or does it

IV\. The specification of it, in a scornful and opprobrious question:
"Where is (now) thy God?"

\- Thomas Horton.

[Psa 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#004.md)

I. It is common for the mind, in seasons of sorrow, to seek relief from
the present in recollections of the past.

II\. In recollections of past enjoyments, those that relate to social
worship will be peculiarly dear to the servant of God.

III\. Man is a social being, hence he derives help from united worship.

\- H. March.

[Psa 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#004.md) - "I pour out my soul in
me." The uselessness of mistrustful introspection.

[Psa 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#004.md) - "I had gone with the
multitude," etc. Company, if it be that which is good, is a very blessed

[Psa 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005.md) - "Why art thou cast down?"

I. The mind, even of a holy man may be unduly cast down and disquieted.

II\. In cases of undue dejection and disquietude the proper remedy is to
expostulate with the soul, and to direct it to the only true source of
relief.

III\. Expostulation with the soul in times of distress, is then
productive of its proper end, when it leads to an immediate application
to God.

\- H. March.

[Psa 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005.md) - An emphasis of enquiry or
examination; David calls himself to account for his present passion and
trouble of mind. An emphasis of reproof or objurgation; David chides and

[Psa 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#006.md) - "Remember thee." The
consolation derivable from thoughts of God.

[Psa 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#006.md) - "Therefore will I remember
thee." There are two ways of understanding this; each of them
instructive and profitable....

I. It may be considered as an expression of determined remembrance of
God should he ever be found in such places and conditions. Believers can
suppose the worst, and yet hope for the best.

II\. The language may be considered as an expression of encouragement
derived from reflection. He had been in these situations and
circumstances, and had experienced in them displays of divine providence

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Title

"Sons of Korah." Who were the sons of Korah? These opinions have more or
less prevailed. One is that they sprang from some one of that name in
the days of David. Mudge and others think that the sons of Korah were a
society of musicians, founded or presided over by Korah. Others think
that the sons of Korah were the surviving descendants of that miserable
man who, together with two hundred and fifty of his adherents, who were
princes, perished when "the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them
up, together with Korah." In [Num
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#011.md), we read: "Notwithstanding the
children of Korah died not." They had taken the warning given, and had
departed from the tents of these wicked men. [Num
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#024.md), [Num
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#026.md). It must be admitted that the
name Korah and the patronymie Korahite are found in the Scriptures in a
way that creates considerable doubt respecting the particular man from
whom the Korahites are named. See [Ch1
1:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#035.md); [Ch1
2:43](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#043.md); [Ch1
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#022.md), [Ch1
6:54](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#054.md); [Ch1
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#019.md); [Ch1
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#001.md); [Ch2
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#019.md). Yet the more common belief is
that they descended from him who perished for his gain-saying. This view
is taken by Ainsworth with entire confidence, by Gill, and others.
Korah, who perished, was a Levite. Whatever may have been their origin,
it is clear the sons of Korah were a Levitical family of singers.
Nothing, then, could be more appropriate than the dedication of a sacred
song to these very people. - William S. Plumer

Title

"Sons of Korah." The "Korah" whose "sons" are here spoken of, is the
Levite who headed the insurrection against Moses and Aaron in the
wilderness. Numbers 16. We find his descendants existing as a powerful
Levitical family in the time of David, at least, if they are to be
identified, as is probable, with the Korahites mentioned in [Ch1
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#006.md), who, like our own warlike
bishops of former times, seem to have known how to doff the priestly
vestment for the soldier's armour, and whose hand could wield the sword
as well as strike the harp. The Korahites were a part of the band who
acknowledged David as their chief, at Ziklag; warriors "whose faces," it
is said, "were like the faces of lions, and who were (for speed) like
gazelles upon the mountains." According to [Ch1
9:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#017.md), the Korahites were in David's
time, keepers of the threshold-of the tabernacle; and still earlier, in
the time of Moses, watchmen at the entrance of the camp of the Levites.
In 1 Chron. 26:1-19, we find two branches of this family associated with
that of Merari, as guardians of the doors of the Temple. There is
probably an allusion to this their office, in [Psa
84:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#010.md). But the Korahites were also
celebrated musicians and singers; see 1 Chron. 6:16-33, where Heman, one
of the three famous musicians of the time, is said to be a Korahite
(comp. 1 Chron. 25). The musical reputation of the family continued in
the time of Jehoshaphat ([Ch2 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#019).md),
where we have the peculiar doubly plural form בּגי הקּרהים, "Sons of the
Korahites." - J. J. Stewart. Perowne.

Title

"Sons of Korah." Medival writers remark how here, as so often, it was
the will of God to raise up saints where they could have been least
looked for. Who should imagine that from the posterity of him who said,
"Ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Aaron," should have risen those
whose sweet Psalms would be the heritage of the church of God to the end
of time? - J. M. Neale.

[Psa 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md)

"The hart panteth after the water brooks." And here we have started up,
and sent leaping over the plain another of Solomon's favourites. What
elegant creatures those gazelles are, and how gracefully they bound!...
The sacred writers frequently mention gazelles under the various names
of harts, roes, and hinds.... I have seen large flocks of these panting
harts gather round the water-brooks in the great deserts of Central
Syria, so subdued by thirst that you could approach quite near them
before they fled. - W. M. Thomson.

[Psa 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md)

Little do the drunkards think that take so much pleasure in frequenting
the houses of Bacchus that the godly take a great deal more, and have a
great deal more joy in frequenting the houses of God. But 'tis a thing
that God promised long ago by the prophet: "Them will I bring to my holy
mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt
offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for
mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people." [Isa
56:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#007.md). And methinks, I hear the willing
people of God's power, merrily calling one to another in the words of
[Mic 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#002.md), "come, and let us go up to
the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he
will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law
shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem." How is
a godly man ravished with "the beauty of holiness," when he is at such
meetings! How was holy David taken with being in the house of God at
Jerusalem! insomuch, that if he were kept from it but a little while,
his soul panted for it, and longed after it, and fainted for lack of it,
as a thirsty hart would do for lack of water! "As the hart panteth after
the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. My soul
thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear
before God?" The poor disconsolate? captives preferred it to the best
place in their memory. "If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand
forget her cunning" ([Psa 137:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#005).md); nay,
they preferred it to their chiefest joy: If I do not remember thee, let
my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem
above my chief joy," [Psa 137:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#006.md). There
was no place in the world that David regarded or cared to be in in
comparison of it. "A day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had
rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the
tents of wickedness" ([Psa 84:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#010).md),
insomuch, that he could find it in his heart, nay, and would choose, if
he might have his desire, to spend all his days in that house. [Psa
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004.md). - Zachary Bogan.

[Psa 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md)

The soul strongly desires acquaintance with. God here in his ordinances.
Chrysostom's very rhetorical upon the text, and tells us how that David,
like a lover in absence, must express his affections: as they have their
dainty sighs, and passionate complaints, their loving exclamations and
sundry discoveries of affection; they can meet with never a tree, but in
the bark of it they must engrave the name of their darling, Δεινὸς δ̓ ὁ
ἔρως ὥσπες ὁ κιττὸς αυτὸν ἐκ πάσης ἀναδῆσαι προφάωεωσ;'twill twine upon
every opportunity, as the Moralist speaks. And the true lovers of God,
they are always thinking upon him, sighing for him, panting after him,
talking of him, and (if 'twere possible) would engrave the name of the
Lord Jesus upon the breasts of all the men in the world. Look upon
David, now a banished man, and fled from the presence of Saul, and see
how he behaves himself: not like Themistocles or Camillus, or some of
those brave banished worthies. He does not complain of the
ungratefulness of his country, the malice of his adversaries, and his
own unhappy success. No, instead of murmuring, he falls a panting, and
that only after his God. He is banished from the sanctuary, the palace
of God's nearest presence, and chiefest residence; he can't enjoy the
beauty of holiness, and all other places seem to him but as the tents of
Kedar. He is banished from the temple, and he thinks himself banished
from his God, as it is in the following words, "When shall I come and
appear before God?" The whole stream of expositors run this way, that it
is meant of his strong longing to visit the Temple, and those amiable
courts of his God, with which his soul was so much taken. - Nathanael
Culverwel's "Panting Soul," 1652.

[Psa 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md), [Psa
42:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#002.md), [Psa
42:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#003.md)

... are an illustration of the frequent use of the word Elohim in the
second book of Psalms. We give Fry's translation of the first three
verses -

As the hart looketh for the springs of water,

So my soul looketh for thee, O Elohim.

My soul is athirst for Elohim, for the living El:

When shall I go and see the race of Elohim?

My tears have been my meat day and night,

While they say to me continually, Where is thy Elohim?

[Psa 42:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#002.md)

"My soul thirsteth for God," etc. See that your heart rest not short of
Christ in any duty. Let go your hold of no duty until you find something
of Christ in it; and until you get not only an handful, but an armful
(with old Simeon, [Luk 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#028).md); yea, a
heartful of the blessed and beautiful babe of Bethlehem therein. Indeed
you should have commerce with heaven, and communion with Christ in duty,
which is therefore called the presence of God, or your appearing before
him. [Exo 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#017.md), and [Psa
42:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#002.md). Your duties then must be as a
bridge to give you passage, or as a boat to carry you over into the
bosom of Christ. Holy Mr. Bradford, Martyr, said he could not leave
confession till he found his heart touched and broken for sin; nor
supplication, till his heart was affected with the beauty of the
blessings desired; nor thanksgiving, till his soul was quickened in
return of praises; nor any duty, until his heart was brought into a duty
frame, and something of Christ was found therein. Accordingly Bernard
speaks, Nunquam abs te absque te recedam Domine: I will never depart (in
duty) from thee without thee, Lord. Augustine said he loved not Tully's
elegant orations (as formerly) because he could not find Christ in them:
nor doth a gracious soul love empty duties. Rhetorical flowers and
flourishes, expressions without impressions in praying or preaching, are
not true bread, but a tinkling cymbal to it, and it cannot be put off
with the empty spoon of ary notions, or lovely (that are not also
lively) songs: if Christ talk with you in the way (of duty) your heart
will burn within you. [Luk 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#016.md), [Luk
24:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#032.md). - Christopher Ness's "Chrystal
Mirrour," 1679.

[Psa 42:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#002.md)

"The living God." There are three respects especially in which our God
is said to be the "living God." First, originally, because he only hath
life in himself, and of himself, and all creatures have it from him.
Secondly, operatively, because he is the only giver of life unto man.
Our life, in the threefold extent and capacity of it, whether we take it
for natural, or spiritual, or eternal; flows to us from God. Thirdly,
God is said to be the "living God" by way of distinction, and in
opposition to all false gods. - Thomas Horton.

[Psa 42:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#002) (last clause.md)

A wicked man can never say in good earnest, "When shall I come and
appear before God?" because he shall do so too soon, and before he
would, as the devils that said Christ came "to torment them before their
time." Ask a thief and a malefactor whether he would willingly appear
before the judge. No, I warrant you, not he; he had rather there were no
judge at all to appear before. And so is it with worldly men in regard
of God they desire rather to be hidden from him. - Thomas Horton.

[Psa 42:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#002.md)

"Come and appear before God." When any of us have been at church, and
waited in the sanctuary, let us examine what did we go thither to see; a
shadow of religion? An outside of Christian forms? A graceful orator?
The figures and shapes of devotion? Surely then we might with as much:
wisdom, and more innocence, have gone to the wilderness "to see a reed
shaken with the wind." Can we say as the Greeks at the feast ([Joh
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#021).md), "We would see Jesus?" Or as
Absalom ([Sa2 14:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#032).md), "It is to little
purpose I am come to Jerusalem if I may not see the King's face." To
little purpose we go to church, or attend on ordinances, if we seek not,
if we see not God there. - Isaac Watts, D.D., 1674-1748.

[Psa 42:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#002.md)

If you attempt to put a little child off with toys and fine things, it
will not be pleased long, it will cry for its mother's breast; so, let a
man come into the pulpit with pretty Latin and Greek sentences, and fine
stories, these will not content a hungry soul, he must have the sincere
milk of the word to feed upon. - Oliver Heywood.

[Psa 42:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#002.md)

"When shall I come and appear before God?" -

While I am banish'd from thy house

I mourn in secret, Lord;

"When shall I come and pay my vows,

And hear thy holy word?"

So while I dwell in bonds of clay,

Methinks my soul shall groan.

"When shall I wing my heavenly way

And stand before thy throne?"

I love to see my Lord below,

His church displays his grace;

But upper worlds his glory know

And view him face to face.

I love to worship at his feet,

Though sin attack me there,

But saints exalted near his seat

Have no assaults to fear.

I'm pleased to meet him in his court,

And taste his heavenly love,

But still think his visits short,.

Or I too soon remove.

He shines, and I am all delight,

He hides and all is pain;

When will he fix me in his sight,

And ne'er depart again?

Isaac Watts, from his Sermons.

"My tears have been roll meat day and night." The Psalmist could eat
nothing because of his extreme grief, - John Gadsby.

[Psa 42:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#003.md)

"They say unto me." It is not only of me, but to me; they spake it to
his very face, as those who were ready to justify it and make it good,
that God had forsaken him. Backbiting argues more baseness, but open
reproach carries more boldness,, and shamelessness, and impudence in it;
and this is that which David s enemies were guilty of here in this
place. - Thomas Horton

[Psa 42:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#003.md)

"Where is thy God?" God's children are impatient, as far as they are
men, of reproaches; but so far as they are Christian men, they are
impatient of reproaches in religion; "Where is now thy God?" They were
not such desperate Atheists as to think there was no God, to call in
question whether there was a God or no, though, indeed, they were little
better; but they rather reproach and upbraid him with his singularity,
where is thy God? You are one of God's darlings; you are one that
thought nobody served God but you; you are one that will go alone - your
God! So this is an ordinary reproach, an ordinary part for wicked men to
cast at the 'best people, especially when they are in misery. What is
become of your profession now? What is become of your forwardness and
strictness now? What is become of your God that you bragged so of, and
thought yourselves so happy in, as if he had been nobody's God but
yours? We may learn hence the disposition of wicked men. It is a
character of a poisonful, cursed disposition to upbraid a man with his
religion.

But what is the scope? The scope is worse than the words "where is thy
God?" The scope is to shake his faith and his confidence in God, and
this that is which touched him so nearly while they upbraided him. For
the devil knows well enough that as long as God and the soul join
together, it is in vain to trouble any man, therefore he labours to put
jealousies, to accuse God to man, and man to God. He knows there is
nothing in the world can stand against God. As long as we make God our
confidence, all his enterprises are in vain. His scope is, therefore, to
shake our affiance in God; "Where is thy God?" So he dealt with the head
or the church, our blessed Saviour himself, when he came to tempt him.
"If thou be the Son of God, command these stones to be made bread." [Mat
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#003.md). He comes with an, "if" he
laboured to shake him in his Sonship. The devil, since he was divided
from God himself eternally, is become a spirit of division; he labours
to divide even God the Father from his own Son; "If thou be the Son of
God?" So he labours to sever Christians from their head Christ. "Where
is thy God?" There was his scope, to breed division if he could, between
his heart and God, that he might call God into jealousy, as if he had
not regarded him' thou hast taken a great deal of pains in serving thy
God; thou seest how he regards thee now; "Where is thy God?" - Richard
Sibbes.

[Psa 42:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#003.md)

How powerfully do the scoffs and reproaches of the ungodly tend to shake
the faith of a mind already dejected! How peculiarly afflictive to the
soul that loves God, is the dishonour cast upon him by his enemies! -
Henry March, in "Sabbaths at Home," 1823.

[Psa 42:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#003.md)

"Where is thy God?

"Where is now thy God!" Oh, sorrow!

Hourly thus to hear him say,

Finding thus the longed-for morrow,

Mournful as the dark today.

Yet not thus my soul would languish,

Would not thus be grieved and shamed

But for that severer anguish,.

When I hear the Lord defamed.

"Where is now thy God!" Oh, aid me,

Lord of mercy, to reply -

"He is Here - though foes invade me,

Know his outstretched arm is nigh."

Help me thus to be victorious,

While the shield of faith I take;

Lord, appear, and make thee glorious:

Help me for thy honour's sake.

Henry March.

[Psa 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#004.md)

"When I remember these things," etc. To a person in misery it is a great
increase of misery to have been once happy; it was to David an occasion
of new tears when he remembered his former joys. Time was, says the poor
soul, when I thought of God with comfort, and when I thought of him as
my own God.; and to lose a God that I once enjoyed is the loss of all my
losses, and of all my, terrors the most terrible. Time was when I could
go and pray to him, and ease myself in prayer; but now I have no
boldness, no hope, no success in prayer. I cannot call him my Father any
more. Time was when I could read the Bible and treasure up the promises,
and survey the land of Canaan as my own inheritance; but now I dare not
look into the Word lest I read my own condemnation there. The Sabbath
was formerly to me as one of the days of heaven, but now it is also, as
well as the rest, a sad and a mournful day. I formerly rejoiced in the
name of Christ, "I sat under his shadow." [Sol
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#003.md). I was in his eyes as one that
found favour; but now my soul is like the deserts of Arabia, I am
scorched with burning heat. From how great a height have I fallen! How
fair was I once for heaven and for salvation, and now am like to come
short of it! I once was flourishing in the courts of, the Lord, and now
all my fruit is blasted and withered away: "his dew lay all night upon
my branches," but now I am like the mountains of Gilboa, no rain falls
upon me. Had I never heard of heaven I could not have been so miserable
as I now am: had I never known God, the loss of him had not been so
terrible as now it is like to be. [Job
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#002.md), [Job
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#003.md). - Timothy Rogers.

[Psa 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#004) (first clause.md)

The blessedness of even the remembrance of divine worship is so great,
that it can save the soul from despair. - J. P. Lange's Commentary.

[Psa 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#004.md)

"I pour out my soul." The very soul of prayer lies in the pouring out of
the soul before God. - Thomas Brooks.

[Psa 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#004.md)

"I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God,
with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday."
The gracious God is pleased to esteem it his glory to have many beggars
thronging at the beautiful gate of his temple, for spiritual and
corporal alms. What an honour is it to our great Landlord that
multitudes of tenants flock together to his house to pay their rent of
thanks and worship for their all which they hold of him! How loud and
lovely is the noise of many golden trumpets! Good Lord, what an echo do
they make in heaven's ears! When many skilful musicians play in concert
with well tuned and prepared instruments the music cannot but be
ravishing to God himself. - George Swinnock.

[Psa 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#004.md)

Do but consider David's tears and grief for want of, and his fervent
prayers for the fruition of, public ordinances even then, when he had
opportunities for private performances; and surely thou wilt esteem the
ministry of the Word no mean mercy. See his sorrow when he was driven
from God's sanctuary. "When I remember these things I pour out my soul
in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house
of God." "My soul is poured out;" that is, I am overwhelmed with grief,
and ever ready to die when I compare my present condition with my former
happiness in the fruition of religious assemblies. There is an elegancy
in the phrase "poured out;" the word is applied to water, or any liquid
thing, and in Scripture signifieth abundance. [Joe
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#028.md). My life is ready to be poured
out as water upon the ground, which cannot be gathered up again, when I
remember my former mercies, and consider my present misery.... The loss
of his father, mother, wives, children, lands, liberty - nay, of his
very life, would not have gone so near his heart as the loss of public
ordinances. As his sorrow was great for the want, so was his suit most
earnest for the enjoyment of them. How many a prayer doth he put up for
the liberty of the tabernacle! [Psa
43:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#003.md), [Psa
43:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#004.md), and [Psa
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004.md), [Psa
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#008.md). It is the one thing, the
principal thing which he begs of God. - Henry Smith.

[Psa 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#004.md)

The bias of the soul is remarkably shown by the objects of regretful
recollection. - Henry March.

[Psa 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#004.md)

"With a multitude that kept holy day."

Though private prayer be a brave design

Yet public hath more promises, more love:

And love's a weight to hearts, to eyes a sign.

We all are but cold suitors; let us move

Where it is warmest. Leave thy six and seven;

Pray with the most: for where most pray, is heaven.

George Herbert, in "The Temple."

[Psa 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005.md)

See also on verse 11, and Psalm 43 verse 5.

[Psa 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005.md)

"Why art thou cast down, O my soul?" Athanasius counselled his friend,
that when any trouble should fall upon him, he should fall presently to
the reading of this Psalm; for there was a way, he thought, of curing by
the like, as well as by the contrary: for 'tis observed indeed that when
two instruments are tuned to the same unison, if you touch the strings
of the one, the strings of the other will move too, though untouched, if
placed at a convenient distance. That therefore you may try the same
experiments upon yourselves, do but set your affections for a tune in
the same key in which these words were spoken; if really you feel none,
imagine some affliction laid upon you; when you have done so, that you
may be the more fully moved, place your attention at a convenient
distance, look narrowly on this holy prophet, observe how he retires
himself, shuts out the world, calls his sad soul to as sad a reckoning:
Quare tam tristis? O my soul! thou that weft infused to give me life;
nay, says Philo the Jew, a spark, a beam of the divinity, thou, which
shouldst be to this dark body of mine as the sun is to the earth,
enlightening, quickening, cheering up my spirits; tell me, why art thou
clouded? why art thou cast down?....

Think of this, ye that feel the heaviness of your soul; think of it, ye
that do not, for ye may feel it. Know there is a sorrow "that worketh
repentance not to be repented of." Know again there is a sorrow "that
worketh death." Remember there were tears that got sinful Mary heaven;
remember again, there were tears that got sinful Esau nothing. For as in
martyrdom, it is not the sword, the boiling lead, or fire, not what we
suffer, but why, that makes us martyrs; so in our sorrows, it is not how
deep they wound, but why, that justifies them. Let every one, therefore,
that hath a troubled heart, ask his soul the "Why:" "Why art thou cast
down?" Is it not for thine own sins, or the sins of others? Take either
of them, thine eyes will have a large field to water. Is it for that
thou hast been a child of wrath, a servant of the devil? Is it for that
thou art a candle set in the wind, blown at by several temptations? or
is it for that thou wouldst be freed from them? "Woe is me, that I
sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar!" [Psa
120:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#005.md). Art thou troubled as St.
Augustine was, when he read that the way to heaven was narrow, the
number small that travelled thither? Or hast thou put on St. Bernard's
resolution, who had made a compact with his soul, never to joy till he
had heard his Saviour call him, "Come, ye blessed," nor never to leave
sorrowing till he had escaped the bitter sentence, "Go, ye cursed"? If
any of these be the "Why," the ground of thy sorrows, if such thoughts
have cast thee down; know, that thy Saviour hath already blessed thee,
for, "Blessed are they that mourn." The angels are thy servants, they
gather thy tears; God is thy treasurer, he lays them up in his bottle;
the Holy Ghost is thy comforter, he will not leave thee. Fear not, then,
to be thus "cast down," fear not to be thus disquieted within thee. -
Brian Duppa (Bishop), 1588-1662, in a Sermon entitled "The Soule's
Soliloquie."

[Psa 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005.md)

"Why art thou cast down, O my soul?" Why, or what may be the reason,
that this text is three times used in this Psalm and in the next?
whereas you do not find two verses of the same length used in all the
Book of Psalms besides, except in Psalm 107, where is often repeated, "O
that men would praise the Lord," etc. Now, surely, the frequent mention
of this text and words doth argue and note unto us the weightiness of
the matter....

Wicked men oppressed David, and the devil tempted him; yet he chides his
own heart and nothing else. David did not chide at Saul, nor chide at
Absalom; but he chides and checks his own heart. "Why art thou cast
down, O my soul?" Though the devil and wicked men, the one do tempt, the
other do oppress as instruments of punishment for sin; yet we with David
are to chide our own hearts.

Consider, what though in our translations the words are translated and
rendered passively, "Why art thou cast down?" yet, in the original, they
are rendered actively; we read it, "Why art thou cast down?" etc.; but
in the original it is read, מה-תּשׁתּוחחי גפשׁי ימה-תּהמי עלי "Why
bowest (or pressest) thou down thyself, my soul? and why tumultest thou
against me?" As Arias Montanus, Cur humiliasti te? Cur deprimes te anima
mea? So Lorinus, [Pro 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#025.md). And the
words so read, they do intimate thus much, that God's own people may be
cast down too much for the sense of sin, and they are most active in
their own down-casting. It is not God nor the devil that cast thee down;
but Why dost thou cast thyself down? to create more trouble on thy self
than either God doth inflict or the devil tempt thee to. - Christopher
Love, in "The Dejected Soul's Cure," 1657.

[Psa 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005.md)

"Why art thou cast down, O my soul?" Consider but this, how much there
is of God in the affliction. 1. Came it not without God's privity? Why
art thou troubled, then? Thy Father knowing of it would have stopped its
course if it had been best for thee. 2. Came it not without his command?
Why art thou troubled? It is the cup that thy Father hath given thee,
and wilt thou not drink it? 3. Is it thy Father's will that thou
shouldest suffer, and shall it be thy humour to rebel? 4. Hath God done
no more than he might do? Why dost thou murmur, as if he had done thee
wrong? 5. Is it a piece of his wise acting? Why dost thou exalt thy
foolish will above his infinite wisdom? 6. Is his way a way of mercy?
Why does thy mutinous spirit stumble at it, as a rough way? 7. Is the
thing good that is befallen thee? Why dost thou quarrel as if it were
evil? 8. Is it less than men suffer, than his own people, yea, than his
own Son hath suffered, and hast thou cause to complain? 9. Is it but thy
merit? and less than that, too; and shall the living man complain for
the punishment of his sin? 10. Is it in measure, ordered with care? (1)
by the physician's hand: and (2) a little draught, and (3) proportioned
to thy strength; (4) measured out according to the proportion of
strength and comfort he intends to measure thee out, to bear it withal?
Why art thou cast down? Why art thou disquieted? Is the end and fruit of
it but to make thee white, and purify thee? to purge thy sin past, and
to prevent it for the time to come? and dost thou find a present fruit
in it? Dost thou find that now thou art turned into a chalk-stone; thy
groves and images - those corruptions which did attend thee while thou
weft in prosperity, and which would attend thee if thou hadst these good
things which thou wantest, and art disquieted for; and if those evils
which thou feelest or fearest were far from thy sense and fear, would
still attend thee - that those do not now stand up? Lift up thy head,
Christian! say to thy soul, "Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why
art thou disquieted in me?" Meditate what there is of God in the cause
of thy disquietments. - John Collinge (1623-1690) in "A Cordial for a
Fainting Soule," 1652.

[Psa 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005.md)

"Why art thou disquieted?" more literally, tumultuated, a word
frequently applied to the roaring and tumult and tossing of the sea. See
[Isa 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#012.md); [Jer
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#022.md); [Jer
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#023.md); [Jer
51:55](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#055.md). - Henry March.

[Psa 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005.md)

"Hope thou in God." I shall show what powerful influence hope hath on
the Christian in affliction, and how. First, it stills and silenceth him
under affliction. It keeps the king's peace in the heart, which else
would soon be in an uproar. A hopeless soul is clamorous: one while it
chargeth God, another while it reviles his instruments. It cannot long
rest, and no wonder, when hope is not there. Hope hath a rare art in
stilling a froward spirit, when nothing else can; as the mother can make
the crying child quiet by laying it to the breast, when the rod makes it
cry worse. This way David took, and found it effectual; when his soul
was unquiet by reason of his present affliction, he lays it to the
breast of the promise: "Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art
thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God." And here his soul sweetly
sleeps, as the child with the breast in his mouth; and that this was his
usual way, we may think by the frequent instances we find; thrice we
find him taking this course in two Psalms, [Psa
42:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md) and [Psa
43:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#001.md)..... Secondly, this hope fills
the afflicted soul with such inward joy and consolation, that it can
laugh while tears are in the eye, sigh and sing all in a breath; it is
called "the rejoicing of hope," [Heb
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#006.md). And hope never affords more joy
than in affliction. It is on a watery cloud that the sun paints those
curious colours in the rainbow..... There are two graces, which Christ
useth above any other, to fill the soul with joy - faith and hope,
because these two fetch all their wine of joy without door. Faith tells
the soul what Christ hath done for it, and so comforts it; hope revives
the soul with the news of what Christ will do: both draw at one tap -
Christ and his promise. - Condensed from William Gurnall.

[Psa 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005.md)

"Hope thou in God." The word which is here rendered "hope" denotes that
expectation which is founded on faith in God, and which leads the soul
to wait upon him. The idea is beautifully expressed in [Psa
39:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#007.md). "And now, Lord, what wait I for?
my hope is in thee." - Henry March.

[Psa 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005.md)

"I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance." When it may be
said, "He whom God loveth is sick," then it may be said, "This sickness
is not unto death;" and though it be to the first death, yet not to the
second. Who would think when Jonah was in the sea ([Jon
3:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#001).md), that he would preach at
Ninevah? Who would think when Nebuchadnezzar was in the forest (Dan. 4),
that he should reign again in Babel? Who would think when Joseph was
banished of his brethren, that his brethren should seek unto him like
his servants? Who would think when Job scraped his sores upon the
dunghill, all his houses were burned, all his cattle stolen, and all his
children dead, that he should be richer than ever he was? These are the
acts of mercy which make the righteous sing, "The Lord hath triumphed
valiantly." Exodus 15-21. - Henry Smith.

[Psa 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005.md)

"I shall yet praise him." David's mind is upon the duty more than upon
the mercy; upon the duty, as it is a matter of grace, more than upon the
mercy, as it is a matter of sense. And, therefore, by a happy mistake,
his tongue slips, as men are wont to do in such cases, and he puts one
for the other; when he should say, I shall receive mercy from God, he
says, "I shall give praise to him." - Thomas Horton.

[Psa 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005.md)

He is the skilful physician, who at the same time that he evacuates the
disease, doth also comfort and strengthen nature; and he the true
Christian, that doth not content himself with a bare laying aside evil
customs and practices, but labours to walk in the exercise of the
contrary grace. Art thou discomposed with impatience, haunted with a
discontented spirit under any affliction? Think it not enough to silence
thy heart from quarrelling with God, but leave not till thou canst bring
it sweetly to rely on God. Holy David drove it thus far; he did not only
chide his soul for being disquieted, but he charges it to trust in God.
- William Gurnall.

[Psa 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005.md)

There was one Alice Benden, who, among others, was imprisoned for
religion in Canterbury Castle; but after awhile, by the bishop's order,
she was let down into a deep dungeon, where none of her friends could
come at her. There she was fed with an halfpenny bread, and a farthing
beer a day, neither would they allow her any more for her money. Her
lodging was upon a little straw, between a pair of stocks and a stone
wall. This made her grievously to bewail and lament her estate,
reasoning with herself, why her Lord God did in so heavy a wise afflict
her, and suffered her thus to be sequestered from the sweet society of
her loving prison-fellows. In this extremity of misery, and in the midst
of these dolorous mournings she continued, till on a night, repeating
that of the Psalmist: "Why art thou so heavy, O my soul? and why art
thou so cast down within me? Still trust in God," etc.; and, God's right
hand can change all this, etc.; she received comfort in the midst of her
sorrows, and so continued joyful to the time of her release. - Samuel
Clarke's "Mirrour."

[Psa 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005.md), [Psa
42:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#011.md)

In case thou art at any time oppressed with sorrows, ask thy heart and
soul that question which David did in the like case twice in one Psalm:
"Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within
me?" and certainly the soul would return answer, My distress of sadness
springs from my unbelief. You may know the disease by the cure, in the
very next words, "O put thy trust in God; hope thou in God: for I shall
yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God." All
sorrow of heart springs principally from our unbelief, not from the
greatness of other evils; I mean, destructive sorrow, for godly sorrow
is a friend to godly joy. It is not so much the weight of the burthen,
as the soreness of the back, that troubles the poor beast; so it is not
so much the weight of outward evils, as the inward soreness of a galled
conscience, not purified nor healed by faith, that vexeth and troubleth
the poor creature. - Matthew Lawrence, in The Use and Practice of
Faith," 1657.

[Psa 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005.md), [Psa
42:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#011.md)

As afflictions do proceed from ourselves, they may be called troubles,
or perturbations; for the best man doth sometimes cause this bad liquor
to boil out of his own bowels. David, not once, but often, hath cried
out, "Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in
me?" And show me the man that annoyeth and troubleth not himself in
vain, because with patience he doth not tarry the Lord's leisure? The
foolish bird, who, being in a room whose door is locked, and the
casements shut, beateth herself against the wall and windows, breaking
her feathers and bruising her body, whereas, would she stay till the
passages were by the keeper opened, site might depart, being not at all
wounded; even so falleth it out with us: for when the Lord doth shut us
up, and straiten our liberty for a time, we would fain make way for
ourselves, having many devices in our hearts to break through the walls
of his providence; whereas, if we would stay his leisure, depend on his
promise, and submit ourselves to be disposed of by his hand, we might
with more ease endure this prison, and with less hurt at the last be set
at liberty. For God is in one mind, and who can change him? He will
bring to pass that thing that he hath decreed upon us. - John Barlow's
Sermon, 1618.

[Psa 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005.md), [Psa
42:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#011.md)

If you would get assurance, spend more time in strengthening your
evidences for heaven, than in questioning of them. It is the great fault
of many Christians they will spend much time in questioning, and not in
strengthening their comforts. They will reason themselves into unbelief,
and say, Lord, why should I believe? Why should I take hold of a promise
that am so unholy and so unmortified a creature? And so by this they
reason themselves to such a pass that they dare not lay hold upon
Christ, whereas it should be your work to reason yourselves into Christ
as much as you can. Labour to strengthen your comforts, and reason thus,
Why should I not believe in Christ? Thus David did. [Psa
42:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md) "Why art thou troubled, O my
soul, and why art thou cast down within me?" Is not the mercy of God
more than sin in the creature? Is not there free grace where there is
guilt? Are not there pardoning mercies where condemnation is deserved?
You should reason up your comforts rather than reason them down, and
spend more time in strengthening than in questioning of them. You would
count him a very unwise man that hath a lease of so much land, and he
himself shall create scruples and doubts, and shall use no means to make
his title good. And truly many Christians are as unwise for heaven. They
have, as I may say, good bond and seal that God will bring them to
heaven, and yet they will question and cavil themselves into unbelief.
Beloved, this should not be, but you ought rather to strengthen your
comforts than question them. - Christopher Love.

[Psa 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#006.md)

"O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember
thee." "Because I am very low in spirit, am deeply sorrowful, therefore
will I remember thee. I will remember how condescending thou art to thy
'poor and afflicted people;' how ready to receive them when deserted or
cast out by men; how kind and patient to hear their complaint when they
pour out the soul before thee. I will remember thy lovingkindness to me
in seasons past; how thou hast looked on my distress, hast heard the
voice of my supplications, hast delivered me from my trials, or helped
me to bear their burden, strengthening me with strength in my soul. I
will remember all that I have enjoyed of thy presence when waiting on
thee in thy house, or when celebrating thy praises there in company with
thy 'saints, the excellent of the earth.' I will remember what thou art;
how meet an object for the trust of a desolate being like myself! For
though I am poor, thou art rich; though I am weak, thou art mighty;
though I am miserable, thou art happy. I will remember that thou art my
God. That thou hast manifested thyself to my soul, that thou hast
enabled me to choose thee for my portion, that I have trusted in thee,
and have never been confounded. I will remember that word of promise on
which thou hast caused me to hope, to which thou hast ever been faithful
throughout all the past, and will be, as I truly believe, even unto the
end." Oh, how happy, even in the midst of their unhappiness, are they,
who in their trials, can thus take shelter in God! - Henry March.

[Psa 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#006.md)

"My God." Astonishing expression! Who shall dare to say to the Creator
of the ends of the earth, the Majesty in the heavens, "My God"? An
exile, a wanderer, an outcast; a man forsaken, despised, reviled; a soul
cast down and disquieted: he shall dare. By what right? Of covenant. -
Henry March.

[Psa 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#006.md)

"Therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the
Hermonites, from the hill Mizar." It is remarkable what course the
Psalmist took to regain comfort; he would remember three experiments of
his goodness - "the land of Jordan," the land "of the Hermonites," and
"the hill Mizar." First will I remember the land Jordan; that is, I will
remember the great goodness of God in drying up the river Jordan, that
so the tribes of Israel might pass over to the promised land: why, God
that hath been good, will be good. Then, I will remember the land of the
Hermonites; in that land were Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og king
of Bashan, were defeated; that you read of in [Jos
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#001.md), [Jos
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#002.md). "Now these are the kings of the
land, which the children of Israel smote, and possessed their land on
the other side Jordan toward the rising of the sun, from the river Arnon
unto Mount Hermon." Mizar, some think to be a little hill near Mount
Sinai, where the law was given. I will remember God's goodness, in
giving a law to his people. Here David would call to remembrance the
goodness of God of old, to regain to him comfort and quietness in his
mind. - Christopher Love.

[Psa 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#006.md)

"The Hermons," or the peaks or ridges of Hermon, the plural being used
either because of the two peaks of the mountain (Wilson, "Land of the
Bible" ), or as I think probably, of the whole range of its snowy
heights. - J. J. Stewart Perowne.

[Psa 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#006.md)

"The Hermons," i.e., as some suppose, Mount Hermon, and the other
mountains upon that side of the river, just as Baalim means Baal, and
other idols worshipped with him; or more probably Mount Hermon
considered not as a single eminence, but a chain or range, like the
Alps, the Alleghenies, etc. - J. A. Alexander.

[Psa 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#006.md)

"From the hill." He that has a rich life of past experience is thereby
placed upon an eminence from which he may take a happy view of the path
lying before him. - J. P. Lange's Commentary.

[Psa 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#007.md)

"Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts." Here he has
conjoined two awful and terrific phenomena of nature. It is a fact well
ascertained by the evidence of travellers, that the falling of
waterspouts is not uncommon on the coast of Judea. It should seem that
they are occasioned by the congregating of great masses of cloud, whose
waters concentrating to a point, pour themselves down in a tremendous
column, accompanied with a roaring noise. Now, the image conceived in
the mind of the Psalmist seems to be that of the rushing of this vast
water-spout down into the sea, already agitated, and increasing the
turbulence and disorder of its waves. An awful picture! Especially if
there be added to it the ideas of a black tempestuous sky, and the
deafening roar occasioned by the tumult. What would be the situation of
a vessel in the midst of such a tempest, the deluge pouring down from
above, and all around her the furious ocean heaving its tremendous
surges - how ungovernable, how helpless, how next to impossible that she
should escape foundering except by some almost miraculous interference.
Yet to such a situation does David here compare the state of his soul
when submersed, as it were, under a sea of afflictions; "all thy waves
and thy billows are gone over me." How pungent must his sense of grief
have been to occasion him to make use of such a comparison, so strongly
expressive of the utmost danger and terror! - Henry March.

[Psa 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#007.md)

"Deep calleth unto deep," etc. The abyss above calls on the abyss below,
in the voice of the droppings of thy waterspouts. - Targum.

[Psa 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#007.md)

"Deep calleth unto deep." So let prayer unto prayer, and faith unto
faith, and one grace to the exercise of another. If we cannot prevail
with God it may be the first time, yet we may the second; or if not
then, the third. - Thomas Horton.

[Psa 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#007.md)

"Deep calleth unto deep." What's that? Why, it is expressed in the verse
before: "O God," says he, "my soul is cast down within me." "Down," that
is deep into the jaws of distrust and fear. And, Lord, my soul in this
depth of sorrow, calls for help to thy depth of mercy. For though I am
sinking and am going down, yet not so low but that thy mercy is yet
underneath me. Do, of thy compassions, open those everlasting arms, and
catch him that has no help or stay in himself. For so it is with one
that is falling into a well or a dungeon. - John Bunyan.

[Psa 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#007.md)

Here the Psalmist feels the spirit of bondage, which is wrath and fear;
and he prays for the joy of God's salvation, and to be upheld by God's
free spirit, which is the Holy Spirit, the spirit of love and power. He
complains of "deep calling unto deep." A soul in the horrible pit hears
little else but the calls of law and justice for vengeance, which are
always answered again by the accusations of Satan and conscience. The
storms of Sinai, like a water-spout at sea, threaten the earthen vessel
with a deluge of wrath, which would soon drown it in destruction and
perdition. These waves of real, and some imaginary, displeasure (no less
terrible than real), rolling over the poor creature, are ready to send
the bark to the bottom. This is the terrible way in which some fallen
and backsliding souls are purged and reclaimed, and especially such as
have brought public scandal upon the gospel, and church of Christ. -
William Huntington (1744-1813) in "Contemplations of the God of Israel."

[Psa 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#007.md)

"Thy waterspouts, "Dr. Boothroyd translates צגּוריך, "thy cataracts." In
justification of which translation, he observes that the situation of
David suggested this forcible image. He saw the torrents falling from
the precipices, and heard them resounding, and as if calling to one
another for assistance; so, says he, all thy waves, that is, afflictions
and troubles, come upon me and overwhelm me. - John Morison.

[Psa 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#007.md)

"Waterspouts." Look at those clouds which hang like a heavy pall of
sackcloth over the sea, along the western horizon. From them, on such
windy days as these, are formed waterspouts, and I have already noticed
several incipient "spouts" lengthening downward from their lower edge.
These remarkable phenomena occur most frequently in spring, but I have
also seen them in autumn. They are not accompanied with much rain; and
between the dark stratum above and the sea, the sky is clear and bright.
Here and there fragments of black vapour, shaped like long funnels, are
drawn down from the clouds towards the sea, and are seen to be in
violent agitation, whirling round on themselves as they are driven along
by the wind. Directly beneath them the surface of the sea is also in
commotion by a whirlwind, which travels on in concert with the spout
above. I have often seen the two actually unite in mid air, and rush
toward the mountains, writhing, and twisting, and bending, like a huge
serpent, with its head in the clouds and its tail on the deep.

They make a loud noise, of course, and appear very frightful. "Deep
calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy waves and thy
billows are gone over me," said David when his soul was cast down within
him. But, though formidable in appearance, they do very little injury. I
have never heard of more than one instance in which they proved
destructive even to boats, though the sailors are extremely afraid of
them. As soon as they approach the shore, they dissolve and disappear.
That kind of waterspout which bursts on the mountains, generally in the
dry months of summer, does immense mischief. In a few minutes the wadies
along its track are swollen into furious rivers, which sweep away grain,
olives, raisins, and every other produce of the farmer. I have
frequently known them to carry off and drown flocks of sheep and goats,
and even cows, horses, and their owners also. - W. M. Thomson.

[Psa 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#007.md)

"All thy waves and thy billows."

Deep to deep incessant calling,

Tossed by furious tempests' roll,

Endless waves and billows falling,

Overwhelm my fainting soul.

Yet I see a Power presiding

Mid the tumult of the storm,

Ever ruling, ever guiding,

Love's intentions to perform.

Yes, mid sorrows most distressing,

Faith contemplates thy design,

Humbly bowing, and confessing

All the waves and billows Thine.

Henry March.

[Psa 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#007.md)

"All thy waves and thy billows are gone over me."

Wide o'er misfortune's surging tide

Billows succeeding billows spread;

Should one, its fury spent, subside,

Another lifts its boisterous head.

Aeschylus in "The Seven Chiefs against Thebes."

[Psa 42:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#008.md)

"Yet the Lord will command his lovingkindness." His expression is
remarkable; he does not say simply that the Lord will bestow, but,
"command his lovingkindness." As the gift bestowed is grace - free
favour to the unworthy; so the manner of bestowing it is sovereign. It
is given by decree; it is a royal donative. And if he commands the
blessing, who shall hinder its reception? - Henry March.

[Psa 42:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#008.md)

'Tis all one to a godly man, night or day. For what night can there be
to him who hath God always with him, who is a sun to comfort him, as
well as a shield to protect him ([Psa
84:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#011).md); and the light of whose
countenance, if it be but very little, is more comfortable than all
things else whatsoever that the day can bring with it. He can say, "When
I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto me" ([Mic
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#008).md); and "the Lord my God will
enlighten my darkness." [Psa 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#028.md). To
tell you the truth, I think the night is the merriest time that the
godly man hath, and the saddest for the wicked man (who, though he make
use of darkness to hide his sin, yet is he afraid, because of that very
thing in which his safety consists). For if a man be merry in good
company, he must needs be more merry when he enjoys it better, and there
is less to disturb his mirth. So as it is with a godly man in the night,
when the greatest part of his hindrances are removed, and he can
"delight himself in the Almighty" without disturbance. [Job
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#010.md). David says that the Lord would
indeed "command his loving-kindness in the daytime," but "in the night
(says he) his song shall be with me" - "his song," as I think, not of
thanksgiving, but of joy and exultation, such as God uses to give at
that time. [Job 35:10](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#010.md). In the daytime
the soul is so taken up with base employments, so distracted with
variety of sensible objects, and so busied with work for the body, that
either she hath no leisure at all to do her own work (such as this joy
is as much as anything), or she cannot do it so well as she would, or so
well as she could in the night, when she hath less to do. I doubt not
but the worldly and carnal man, now that I am talking so much of night
and sleep, will be ready to say that I do but dream, and to answer me as
the fellow did the hunter, when he bade him hear "what heavenly music
his dogs made." For I know he counts the music and songs that we speak
of, nothing but a frenzy, or a fancy at the least, such as mad and
diseased people have in their brain, while they imagine it to be in the
air. But, as Peter said of those upon whom the Holy Ghost fell. "These
men are not drunk; as ye suppose:" so may I reply to such men, No such
matter, the godly are not mad, as ye suppose, for their songs are not
works of their own fancy, not made of their own head, but set for them
by God himself, "who giveth songs in the night." [Job
35:10](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#010.md). - Zachary Bogan.

[Psa 42:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#008.md)

"And my prayer unto the God of my life." Here may be seen that David's
religion was a religion of prayer after deliverance, as well as before.
The selfish who cry out in trouble will have done with their prayers,
when the trouble is over. With David it was the very reverse.
Deliverance from trouble would strengthen his confidence in God,
embolden his addresses to him, and furnish him with new arguments....
There is great need of prayer after deliverance; for the time of
deliverance is often a time of temptation, the soul being elated, and
thrown off its guard. At such seasons much of the joy that is felt may
be merely natural, as David's would probably be when rescued from that
corroding care which injures the body as well as distresses the soul.
There is danger of mistaking; of supposing it to be all spiritual, and
hence of imagining the soul to be in a higher state of grace than it
really is, and so, of being imperceptibly drawn into a state of false
security. There is then especial need of that prayer. "Hold thou me up,
and I shall be safe." And with some peculiarly, who being of a sanguine
constitution of mind, are in times of enjoyment, soon puffed up and
brought into danger. - Henry March.

[Psa 42:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#008) (last clause.md)

Your song and your prayer must be directed to God as "the God of your
life." You do not own him as God, except you own and adore him as your
all sufficient good, and that "fulness which filleth all in all." You
detract from the glory of his Godhead, if you attribute not this to him;
and if, accordingly, as one that cannot live without him, you do not
seek union with him, and join yourself to him, and then rejoice and
solace yourself in that blessed conjunction. - John Howe.

[Psa 42:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#009.md)

"God my rock." David was a fugitive, with little means of defence, and
continually pursued by enemies who were powerful and numerous. The
country in which he wandered was mountainous, and he often sought and
found shelter on the tops of precipitous rocks, or in their natural
hollows or excavated caves. Thus the idea of shelter and defence being
associated in his mind with that of a rock, how natural that he should
apply the term to God, and when seeking him as his refuge and helper,
should address him by that appellation.... "Why hast thou forgotten me?"
Not that he supposed he was literally forgotten of God, so as to be
given up and abandoned by him; because he had still sufficient trust in
his faithfulness to seek him for a refuge, and to hope in his mercy. His
expression is to be regarded as the language of feeling, not of
judgment. He felt, he seemed, as one forgotten by God. Those visits of
love, those manifestations of favour with which he had formerly been
indulged, and which then seemed to him to be so many tokens of the
divine remembrance, were now withheld, now when, on account of his
distress, they appeared so unspeakably more needful and desirable;
whence it was that he felt as one forgotten. - Henry March.

[Psa 42:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#010.md)

"Mine enemies." It is strange that he should have enemies, that was so
harmless a man that when they were sick and distressed, he prayed for
them, and put on sackcloth for them, as it is, Psalm 35. This
compassionate, sweet-natured man, yet, notwithstanding, you see he had
enemies, and enemies that would discover themselves to reproach him, and
that bitterly; in the bitterest manner, they reproach him in his
religion. We may be armed by this observation against the scandal of
opposition - that if we meet with enemies in the world, we should not be
much offended at it; grieve we may, but wonder he need not. Was there
ever any that did more good than our Saviour Christ? "He went about
doing good." [Act 10:38](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#038.md). He did never
a miracle that was harmful (but only of the swine that were drowned in
the sea, and that was their own fault), but he went about doing all the
good he could; yet, notwithstanding, we see what malicious opposites he
had. That that is true of the head must be true in the members.
Therefore we should rejoice in our conformity to Christ, if it be in a
good cause, that we find enemies and opposition. The devil is not made a
Christian yet, and he will never be made good, for he is in termino, as
we say, he is in his bounds, his nature is immovable; he is in hell in
regard of his estate, though he be loose to do mischief. Now, until the
devil be good, God's children shall never want enemies; and he will
never be good; therefore, though there were good kings and good
governors over all the world, yet good men shall never want enemies as
long as the devil is alive, as long as he hath anything to do in the
world. Enemies, therefore, we must look for, and such enemies as will
not conceal their malice neither; for that were something, if they would
suffer their malice to boil and concoct in their own hearts, but that
will not be, but "out of the abundance of the heart the mouth will
speak." - Richard Sibbes.

[Psa 42:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#010.md)

"They say daily unto me." Here's their constancy and perseverance in
this their carriage and language, it is daily, or all the day,
כּל-היּוס. It is not only for a fit and away, but it is their frequent
and continual practice; it's every, and it's all the day; they begin in
the morning, and they hold out still till night as unquiet persons use
to do; and they begin the week with it, and so they continue till the
end; he could never come into their company or near them, but he had
such language from them. - Thomas Horton.

[Psa 42:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#010.md)

"Where is thy God?" David might rather have said to them, Where are your
eyes? where is your sight? for God is not only in heaven, but in me.
Though David was shut out from the sanctuary, yet David's soul was a
sanctuary for God; for God is not tied to a sanctuary made with hands.
God hath two sanctuaries, he hath two heavens - the heaven of heavens
and a broken spirit. God dwelt in David as in his temple. God was with
David and in him; and he was never more with him, nor never more in him
than in his greatest afflictions. They wanted eyes, he wanted not God.
Though sometimes God hide himself, not only from the world but from his
own children, yet he is there; howsoever their sorrow is such that it
dims their sight (as we see in Hagar), so that they cannot see him for
the present, he sometimes looks in their face, as we see in Mary's case.
She could not see Christ distinctly, but thought him to be the gardener.
There is a kind of concealment awhile in heavenly wisdom, yet
notwithstanding, God is with his children always, and they know it by
faith though not by feeling always.... Therefore, it was an ignorant
question of them to ask, Where is thy God? It showed that they were
ignorant of the passages of God's dealing with his children, as indeed
none are greater atheists than your scoffers. Where is thy God? as if
God had been only a God of observation, to be observed outwardly in all
his passages towards his children; whereas, as I said, he is a God
hiding himself ofttimes; and he shows himself in contrary conditions
most of all, most comfortably. His work is by contraries. But these
carnal men were ignorant of the mysteries of religion, and the mysteries
of divine providence towards God's children. Therefore, their question
savours of their disposition, Where is now thy God? - Richard Sibbes.

[Psa 42:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#010.md)

"Where is thy God?" It is the deriding question which persecutors put to
the saints in the time of their trials and troubles, Ubi Deus? "Where is
now your God?" But they may return a bold and confident answer, Hic
Deus, "Our God is here," our God is nigh unto us, our God is round about
us, our God is in the midst of us, our God has given us his promise
"that he will never leave us nor forsake us." [Heb
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#005.md). In every trouble, in every
danger, in every death, the Lord will be sure to keep us company. God
will bear his children company, not only whilst they are in a delightful
paradise, but also when they are in a howling wilderness. [Hos
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#014.md). When a company of poor
Christians were going into banishment, one standing by to see them pass
along said, that it was a very sad condition that those poor people were
in, to be thus hurried from the society of men, and to be made
companions of the beasts of the fields. True, said another, it were a
sad condition indeed, if they were carried to a place where they should
not find their God; but let them be of good cheer, for God goes along
with them, and will exhibit the comforts of his presence whithersoever
they go, his presence is infinite, and filleth all places. The Rabbins
put Makom, which signifies place, among the names of God; Bythner brings
them in expounding that text ([Est
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#014).md), thus: "Deliverance shall arise
from another place," that is, from God. Now, they called God place,
because he is in every place, filling heaven and earth with his
presence. - Thomas Brooks.

[Psa 42:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#010.md)

Forest-flies, small as they are, drive the noble war-horse mad;
therefore David says, "As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies
reproach me; while they say daily unto me, Where is thy God?" -
Frederick William Robertson, 1851.

[Psa 42:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#011.md)

Imitate here the example of David, instead of yielding to a vague grief;
cite your soul; enquire of it the particular cuse of your sorrow:
different remedies will be requisite according to the different sources
of your distress; and be careful that you trifle not with God, and your
comfort, and your salvation, while you enquire of your soul, "Why art
thou cast down, O my soul?" Be impartial, there is another and more
solemn judgment to succeed' be persevering, like the Psalmist, return,
again and again to the investigation: be prayerful; self-love, or the
delusions of your heart, may otherwise deceive you. Pray then to God, to
"search you, and see if there be any wicked way in you." - Henry
Kollock, D.D., in "Sermons," etc. 1822.

[Psa 42:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#011.md)

"Hope." Hope is like the sun, which, as we journey towards it, casts the
shadow of our burden behind us. - Samuel Smiles, LL.D.

[Psa 42:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#011.md)

"God.... is the health of my countenance." The health of David's
countenance was not in his countenance, but in his God, and this makes
his faith silence his fears, and so peremptorily resolve upon it, that
there is a time coming (how near soever he now lies to the grave's
mouth) when he "shall yet praise him." The health and life of thy grace
lie both of them, not in thy grace, saith faith, but in God, who is thy
God, therefore I shall yet live and praise him. I do not wonder that the
weak Christian is melancholy and sad, when he sees his sickly face in
any other glass than this. - William Gurnall.

[Psa 42:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#011.md)

"The health of my countenance." The countenance is often a true index to
the mind. In the present awakening in religion, nothing is more
remarkable than the sad or joyous looks of those whom God has
spiritually exercised. It is easy to see who are sad, and who happy.
There is nothing new in this; the Psalmist says, "My soul is cast down
within me." Therefore had he a dejected countenance; but said he, "Send
thy light and thy truth; let them lead me; then will I go unto God, my
exceeding joy.... And he shall be the health of my countenance." In his
sorrow, the face of Jesus was marred more than any man's, and his visage
more than the sons of men. The martyr Stephen was so filled with the
sight of Jesus, that in the midst of his persecutors, with death in
prospect, he had a face which "shone as the face of an angel." My
friend, how is it with thee? Is thy countenance sad? or doth it shine
with the joy of the Lord, telling the true tale of thy life and lot? -
J. Denham Smith, 1860.

[Psa 42:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#011.md)

Hast thou seen the sun shine forth in February, and the sky blue, and
the hedgerows bursting into bud, and the primrose peeping beneath the
bank, and the birds singing in the bushes? Thou hast thought that spring
was already come in its beauty and sweet odours. But a few days, and the
clouds returned, and the atmosphere was chilled, and the birds were
mute, and snow was on the ground, and thou hast said that spring would
never come. And thus sometimes the young convert finds his fears removed
and the comforts of the gospel shed abroad in his heart, and praise and
thanksgiving, and a new song put in his mouth. And he deems unadvisedly
that his troubles are past for ever. But awhile, and his doubts return,
and his comforts die away, and his light is taken from him, and his
spirit is overwhelmed, and he is fain to conclude that salvation and all
its blessings are not for him. But the spring, though late, shall break
at last. "Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
within me?" - H. G. Salter's "Book of Illustrations," 1840.

[Psa 42:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#011.md)

His arguments and motives hereunto are impregnated with very great sense
and strength; and urged upon himself as the just rate thereof. "Hope
thou in God." For he is 1. "God." 2. "Thy God." 3. "The health of thy
countenance," and 4. One whom thou shalt (certainly and for ever) praise
as such. And 5. Do it yet, as lamentable and hopeless as thy case
appears at present through seeming difficulties or unlikelihoods. God
and ourselves well understood, deeply considered, and skilfully urged
and improved, give gracious hearts the best encouragements and supports
under the severest accidents of time. And they will very strangely
animate our hopes in God under our sorest troubles and dejections. David
had (1) confidence in God; and (2) reasons for it; and (3) skill and a
heart to urge them. When he reviewed himself, he saw that his soul was
gracious; and so he knew God valued it. It was bent for praising God;
and so he knew that he should have an opportunity and cause to do it,
through some signal favours from him. He had an interest in God; and he
would neither lose it nor neglect it, and he had great experience of
God's former mercies, and he would not forget them. And when he thinks
on God, then praises must be thought on too, and everything relating to
it and all the divine perfections, within the circumference of his
knowledge, must have their fresh remembrances and powerful sense revived
upon his own heart. - Matthew Sylvester (1636-1708), in "Morning
Exercises."

[Psa 42:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#011.md)

The soul, when once greatly disturbed, is often not soon calmed, on
account of infirmities and remaining corruptions. - Henry March.

[Psalms 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 42:1</span></span>

1 As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after
thee, O God.

2 My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God; when shall I come and
appear before God?

3 My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say
unto me, Where is thy God?

4 When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone
with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice
of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday.

5 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in me?
hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the help of his
countenance.

[Psa 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md)

"As the hart panteth after the waterbrooks, so panteth my soul after
thee, 0 God." As after a long drought the poor fainting hind longs for
the streams, or rather as the hunted hart instinctively seeks after the
river to lave its smoking flanks and to escape the dogs, even so my
weary, persecuted soul pants after the Lord my God. Debarred from public
worship, David was heartsick. Ease he did not seek, honour he did not
covet, but the enjoyment of communion with God was an urgent need of his
soul; he viewed it not merely as the sweetest of all luxuries, but as an
absolute necessity, like water to a stag. Like the parched traveller in
the wilderness, whose skin bottle is empty, and who finds the wells dry,
he must drink or die - he must have his God or faint. His soul, his very
self, his deepest life, was insatiable for a sense of the divine
presence. As the hart brays so his soul prays. Giro him his God and he
is as content as the poor deer which at length slakes its thirst and is
perfectly happy; but deny him his Lord, and his heart heaves, his bosom
palpitates, his whole frame is convulsed, like one who gasps for breath,
or pants with long running. Dear reader, dost thou know what this is, by
personally having felt the same? It is a sweet bitterness. The next best
thing to living in the light of the Lord's love is to be unhappy till we
have it, and to pant hourly after it - hourly, did I say? thirst is a
perpetual appetite, and not to be forgotten, and even thus continual is
the heart's longing after God. When it is as natural for us to long for
God as for an animal to thirst, it is well with our souls, however
painful our feelings. We may learn from this verse that the eagerness of
our desires may be pleaded with God, and the more so, because there are
special promises for the importunate and fervent.

[Psa 42:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#002.md)

"My soul." All my nature, my inmost self. "Thirsteth." Which is more
than hungering; hunger you can palliate, but thirst is awful,
insatiable, clamorous, deadly. O to have the most intense craving after
the highest good! this is no questionable mark of grace. "For God." Not
merely for the temple and the ordinances, but for fellowship with God
himself. None but spiritual men can sympathise with this thirst. "For
the living God." Because he lives, and gives to men the living water;
therefore we, with greater eagerness, desire him. A dead God is a mere
mockery; we loathe such a monstrous deity; but the ever-living God, the
perennial fountain of life and light and love, is our soul's desire.
What are gold, honour, pleasure, but dead idols? May we never pant for
these. "When shall I come and appear before God?" He who loves the Lord
loves also the assemblies wherein his name is adored. Vain are all
pretences to religion where the outward means of grace have no
attraction. David was never so much at home as in the house of the Lord;
he was not content with private worship; he did not forsake the place
where saints assemble, as the manner of some is. See how pathetically he
questions as to the prospect of his again uniting in the joyous
gathering! How he repeats and reiterates his desire! After his God, his
Elohim (his God to be worshipped, who had entered into covenant with
him), he pined even as the drooping flowers for the dew, or the moaning
turtle for her mate. It were well if all our resortings to public
worship were viewed as appearances before God, it would then be a sure
mark of grace to delight in them. Alas, how many appear before the
minister, or their fellow men, and think that enough! "To see the face
of God" is the nearer translation of the Hebrew; but the two ideas may
be combined - he would see his God and be seen of him; this is worth
thirsting after!

[Psa 42:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#003.md)

"My tears have been my meat day and night." Salt meats, but healthful to
the soul. When a man comes to tears, constant tears, plenteous tears,
tears that fill his cup and trencher, he is in earnest indeed. As the
big tears stand in the stag's eyes in her distress, so did the salt
drops glitter in the eyes of David. His appetite was gone, his tears not
only seasoned his meat, but became his only meat, he had no mind for
other diet. Perhaps it was well for him that the heart could open the
safety valves; there is a dry grief far more terrible than showery
sorrows. His tears since they were shed because God was blasphemed, were
"honourable dew," drops of holy water, such as Jehovah putteth into his
bottle. "While they continually say unto me, Where is thy God?" Cruel
taunts come naturally from coward minds. Surely they might have left the
mourner alone; he could weep no more than he did - it was a
supererogation of malice to pump more tears from a heart which already
overflowed. Note how incessant was their jeer, and how artfully they
framed it! It cut the good man to the bone to have the faithfulness of
his God impugned. They had better have thrust needles into his eyes than
have darted insinuations against his God. Shimei may here be alluded to
who after this fashion mocked David as he fled from Absalom. He roundly
asserted that David was a bloody man, and that God was punishing him for
supplanting Saul and his house; his wish was father to his thought. The
wicked know that our worst misfortune would be to lose God's favour,
hence their diabolical malice leads them-to declare that such is the
case. Glory be to God, they lie in their throats, for our God is in the
heavens, ay, and in the furnace too, succouring his people.

[Psa 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#004.md)

"When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me." When he harped
upon his woes his heart melted into water and was poured out upon
itself. God hidden, and foes raging, a pair of evils enough to bring
down the stoutest heart! Yet why let reflections so gloomy engross us,
since the result is of no value: merely to turn the soul on itself, to
empty it from itself into itself is useless, how much better to pour out
the heart before the Lord! The prisoner's treadwheel might sooner land
him in the skies than mere inward questioning raise us nearer to
consolation. "For I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the
house of God." Painful reflections were awakened by the memory of past
joys; he had mingled in the pious throng, their numbers had helped to
give him exhilaration and to awaken holy delight, their company had been
a charm to him as with them he ascended the hill of Zion. Gently
proceeding with holy ease, in comely procession, with frequent strains
of song, he and the people of Jehovah had marched in reverent ranks up
to the shrine of sacrifice, the dear abode of peace and holiness. Far
away from such goodly company the holy man pictures the sacred scene and
dwells upon the details of the pious march. "With the voice of joy and
praise, with a multitude that kept holyday." The festive noise is in his
ears, and the solemn dance before his eyes. Perhaps he alludes to the
removal of the ark and to the glorious gatherings of the tribes on that
grand national holy day and holiday. How changed his present place! For
Zion, a wilderness.; for the priests in white linen, soldiers in
garments of war; for the song, the sneer of blasphemy; for the
festivity, lamentation; for joy in the Lord, a mournful dirge over his
absence.

"I sigh to think of happier days

When thou, O God, wast nigh,

When every heart was tuned to praise;

And none more blest than I."

When in a foreign land, amid the idolatries of Popery, we have felt just
the same home-sickness for the house of the Lord which is here
described; we have said "Ziona, Ziona, our holy and beautiful house,
when shall I see thee again? Thou church of the living God, my mother,
my home, when shall I hear thy Psalms and holy prayers, and once again
behold the Lord in the midst of his people?" David appears to have had a
peculiarly tender remembrance of the singing of the pilgrims, and
assuredly it is the most delightful part of worship and that which comes
nearest to the adoration of heaven. What a degradation to supplant the
intelligent song of the whole congregation by the theatrical
prettinesses of a quartette, the refined niceties of a choir, or the
blowing off of wind from inanimate bellows and pipes! We might as well
pray by machinery as praise by it.

[Psa 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005.md)

"Why art thou cast down, O my soul?" As though he were two men, the
Psalmist talks to himself. His faith reasons with his fears, his hope
argues with his sorrows. These present troubles, are they to last for
ever? The rejoicings of my foes, are they more than empty talk? My
absence, from the solemn feasts, is that a perpetual exile? Why this
deep depression, this faithless fainting, this chicken-hearted
melancholy? As Trapp says, "David chideth David out of the dumps;" and
herein he is an example for all desponding ones. To search out the cause
of our sorrow is often the best surgery for grief. Self-ignorance is not
bliss; in this case it is misery. The mist of ignorance magnifies the
causes of our alarm; a clearer view will make monsters dwindle into
trifles. "Why art thou disquieted within me?" Why is my quiet gone? If I
cannot keep a public Sabbath, yet wherefore do I deny my soul her indoor
Sabbath? Why am I agitated like a troubled sea, and why do my thoughts
make a noise like a tumultuous multitude? The causes are not enough to
justify such utter yielding to despondency. Up, my heart! What aileth
thee? Play the man, and thy castings down shall turn to liftings up, and
thy disquietudes to calm. "Hope thou in God." If every evil be let loose
from Pandora's box, yet is there hope at the bottom. This is the grace
that swims, though the waves roar and be troubled. God is unchangeable,
and therefore his grace is the ground for unshaken hope. If everything
be dark, yet the day will come, and meanwhile hope carries stars in her
eyes; her lamps are not dependent upon oil from without, her light is
fed by secret visitations of God, which sustain the spirit. "For I shall
yet praise him." Yet will my sighs give place to songs, my mournful
ditties shall be exchanged for triumphal paeans. A loss of the present
sense of God's love is not a loss of that love itself; the jewel is
there, though it gleams not on our breast; hope knows her title good
when she cannot read it clear; she expects the promised boon though
present providence stands before her with empty hands. "For I shall yet
praise him for the help of his countenance." Salvations come from the
propitious face of God, and he will yet lift up his countenance upon us.
Note well that the main hope and chief desire of David rest in the smile
of God. His face is what he seeks and hopes to see, and this will
recover his low spirits, this will put to scorn his laughing enemies,
this will restore to him all the joys of those holy and happy days
around which memory lingers. This is grand cheer. This verse, like the
singing of Paul and Silas, looses chains and shakes prison walls. He who
can use such heroic language in his gloomy hours will surely conquer. In
the garden of hope grow the laurels for future victories, the roses of
coming joy, the lilies of approaching peace.

[Psalms 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 42:6</span></span>

6 O my God, my soul is cast down within me; therefore will I remember
thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill
Mizar.

7 Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts; all thy waves
and thy billows are gone over me.

8 Yet the Lord will command his lovingkindness in the daytime, and in
the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of my
life.

9 I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I
mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

10 As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while they say
daily unto me, Where is thy God?

11 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within
me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of
my countenance, and my God.

[Psa 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#006.md)

"O my God, my soul is cast down within me." Here the song begins again
upon the brass. So sweet an ending deserves that for the sake of a
second hopeful close the Psalm should even begin again. Perhaps the
Psalmist's dejection continued, the spasm of despondency returned; well,
then, he will down with his harp again, and try again its power upon
himself, as in his younger days, he saw its influence upon Saul when the
evil spirit came upon him. With God the song begins the second time more
nearly than at first. The singer was also a little more tranquil.
Outward expression of desire was gone; there was no visible panting; the
sorrow was now all restrained within doors. Within or upon himself he
was cast down; and, verily, it may well be so, while our thoughts look
more within than upward. If self were to furnish comfort, we should have
but poor provender. There is no solid foundation for comfort in such
fickle frames as our heart is subject to. It is well to tell the Lord
how we feel, and the more plain the confession the better: David talks
like a sick child to its mother, and we should learn to imitate him.
"Therefore will I remember thee." 'Tis well to fly to our God. Here is
terra firma. Blessed downcasting which drives us to so sure a rock of
refuge as thee, O Lord! "From the hill Mizar." He recalls his seasons of
choice communion by the river and among the hills, and especially that
dearest hour upon the little hill, where love spake her sweetest
language and revealed her nearest fellowship. It is great wisdom to
store up in memory our choice occasions of converse with heaven; we may
want them another day, when the Lord is slow in bringing back his
banished ones, and our soul is aching with fear. "His love in times
past" has been a precious cordial to many a fainting one; like soft
breath it has fanned the smoking flax into a flame, and bound up the
bruised reed. Oh, never-to-be-forgotten valley of Achor, thou art a door
of hope! Fair days, now gone, ye have left a light behind you which
cheers our present gloom. Or does David mean that even where he was he
would bethink him of his God; does he declare that, forgetful of time
and place, he would count Jordan as sacred as Siloa, Hermon as holy as
Zion, and even Mizar, that insignificant rising ground, as glorious as
the mountains which are round about Jerusalem! Oh! it is a heavenly
heart which can sing -

"To me remains nor place nor time;

My country is in every clime;

I can be calm and free from care

On any shore, since God is there.

"Could I be cast where thou art not,

That were indeed a dreadful lot,

But regions none remote I call,

Secure of finding God in all."

[Psa 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#007.md)

"Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts." Thy severe
dealings with me seem to excite all creation to attack me; heaven, and
earth, and hell, call to each other, stirring each other up in dreadful
conspiracy against my peace. As in a waterspout, the deeps above and
below clasp hands, so it seemed to David that heaven and earth united to
create a tempest around him. His woes were incessant and overwhelming.
Billow followed billow, one sea echoed the roaring of another; bodily
pain aroused mental fear, Satanic suggestions chimed in with mistrustful
foreboding, outward tribulation thundered in awful harmony with inward
anguish: his soul seemed drowned as in a universal deluge of trouble,
over whose waves the providence of the Lord moved as a watery pillar, in
dreadful majesty inspiring the utmost terror. As for the afflicted one
he was like a lonely bark around which the fury of a storm is bursting,
or a mariner floating on a mast, almost every moment submerged. "All thy
waves and thy billows are gone over me." David thought that every
trouble in the world had met in him, but he exaggerated, for all the
breaking waves of Jehovah have passed over none but the Lord Jesus;
there are griefs to which he makes his children strangers for his love's
sake. Sorrow naturally states its case forcibly; the mercy is that the
Lord after all hath not dealt with us according to our fears. Yet what a
plight to be in! Atlantic rollers sweeping in ceaseless succession over
one's head, waterspouts coming nearer and nearer, and all the ocean in
uproar around the weary swimmer; most of the heirs of heaven can realise
the description, for they have experienced the like. This is a deep
experience unknown to babes in grace, but common enough to such as do
business on great waters of affliction: to such it is some comfort to
remember that the waves and billows are the Lords, "thy waves and thy
billows," says David, they are all sent, and directed by him, and
achieve his designs, and the child of God knowing this, is the more
resigned.

[Psa 42:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#008.md)

"Yet the Lord will command his lovingkindness in the daytime." Come what
may there shall be "a certain secret something" to sweeten all.
Lovingkindness is a noble life-belt in a rough sea. The day may darken
into a strange and untimely midnight, but the love of God ordained of
old to be the portion of the elect, shall be by sovereign decree meted
out to them. No day shall ever dawn on an heir of grace and find him
altogether forsaken of his Lord: the Lord reigneth, and as a sovereign
he will with authority command mercy to be reserved for his chosen. "And
in the night." Both divisions of the day shall be illuminated with
special love, and no stress of trial shall prevent it. Our God is God of
the nights as well as the days; none shall find his Israel unprotected,
be the hour what it may. "His song shall be with me." Songs of praise
for blessings received shall cheer the gloom of night. No music sweeter
than this. The belief that we shall yet glorify the Lord for mercy given
in extremity is a delightful stay to the soul. Affliction may put out
our candle, but if it cannot silence our song we will soon light the
candle again. "And my prayer unto the God of my life." Prayer is yoked
with praise. He who is the living God, is the God of our life, from him
we derive it, with him in prayer and praise we spend it, to him we
devote it, in him we shall perfect it. To be assured that our sighs and
songs shall both have free access to our glorious Lord is to have reason
for hope in the most deplorable condition.

[Psa 42:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#009.md)

"I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me." Faith is
allowed to enquire of her God the causes of his displeasure, and she is
even permitted to expostulate with him and put him in mind of his
promises, and ask why apparently they are not fulfilled. If the Lord be
indeed our refuge, when we find no refuge, it is time to be raising the
question, "Why is this?" Yet we must not let go our hold, the Lord must
be "my" rock still; we must keep to him as our alone confidence, and
never forego our interest in him. "Why go I mourning because of the
oppression of the enemy?" He who condescends to be pleaded with by
Abraham, his friend, allows us to put to him the question that we may
search out the causes of his severity towards us. Surely he can have no
pleasure in seeing the faces of his servants stained and squalid with
their tears; he can find no content in the harshness with which their
foes assail them. He can never take pleasure in the tyranny with which
Satan vexes them. Why then does he leave them to be mocked by his
enemies and their? How can the strong God, who is as firm and abiding as
a rock, be also as hard and unmoved as a rock towards those who trust in
him? Such enquiries humbly pressed often afford relief to the soul. To
know the reason for sorrow is in part to know how to escape it, or at
least to endure it. Want of attentive consideration often makes
adversity appear to be more mysterious and hopeless than it really is.
It is a pitiable thing for any man to have a limb amputated, but when we
know that the operation was needful to save life, we are glad to hear
that it has been successfully performed; even thus as trial unfolds, the
design of the Lord in sending it becomes far more easy to bear.

[Psa 42:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#010.md)

"As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me." Cruel mockeries
cut deeper than the flesh, they reach the soul as though a rapier were
introduced between the ribs to prick the heart. If reproaches kill not,
yet they are killing, the pain caused is excruciating. The tongue cuts
to the bone, and its wounds are hard to cure. "While they say daily unto
me, Where is thy God?" This is the unkindest cut of all, reflecting as
it does both upon the Lord's faithfulness and his servant's character.
Such was the malice of David's foes, that having thought of the cruel
question, they said it, said it daily, repeated it to him, and that for
a length of time; surely the continual yapping of these curs at his heel
was enough to madden him, and perhaps would have done so had he not
resorted to prayer and made the persecutions of his enemies a plea with
his Lord.

[Psa 42:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#011.md)

"Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within
me?" In the rehearsal of his sorrow, he finds after all no sufficient
ground for being disquieted. Looked in the face, his fears were not so
overwhelming as they seemed when shrouded in obscurity. "Hope thou in
God." Let the anchor still keep its hold. God is faithful, God is love,
therefore there is room and reason for hope. "Who is the health of my
countenance, and my God." This is the same hopeful expression as that
contained in verse five, but the addition of "and my God" shows that the
writer was growing in confidence, and was able defiantly to reply to the
question, "Where is thy God?" Here, even here, he is, ready to deliver
me. I am not ashamed to own him amid your sneers and taunts, for 'he
will rescue me out of your hands. Thus faith closes the struggle, a
victor in fact by anticipation, and in heart by firm reliance. The
saddest countenance shall yet be made to shine, if there be a taking of
God at his word and an expectation of his salvation.

"For yet I know I shall him praise

Who graciously to me,

The health is of my countenance,

Yea, mine own God is he."
