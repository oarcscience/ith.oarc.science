[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 32:0</span></span>

Title - A Psalm of David, Maschil. That David wrote this gloriously
evangelic Psalm is proved not only by this heading, but by the words of
the apostle Paul, in [Rom 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#006.md), [Rom
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#007.md), [Rom
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#008.md). "Even as David also describeth
the blessedness of the man unto whom God imputeth righteousness without
works," etc. Probably his deep repentance over his great sin was
followed by such blissful peace, that he was led to pour out his spirit
in the soft music of this choice song. In the order of history it seems
to follow the fifty-first. Maschil is a new title to us, and indicates
that this is an instructive or didactic Psalm. The experience of one
believer affords rich instruction to others, it reveals the footsteps of
the flock, and so comforts and directs the weak. Perhaps it was
important in this case to prefix the word, that doubting saints might
not imagine the Psalm to be the peculiar utterance of a singular
individual, but might appropriate it to themselves as a lesson from the
Spirit of God. David promised in the fifty-first Psalm to teach
transgressors the Lord's ways, and here he does it most effectually.
Grotius thinks that this Psalm was meant to be sung on the annual day of
the Jewish expiation, when a general confession of their sins was made.

Division - In our reading we have found it convenient to note the
benediction of the pardoned, [Psa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md), [Psa
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#002.md); David's personal confession,
[Psa 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#003.md), [Psa
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#004.md), [Psa
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#005.md); and the application of the case
to others, [Psa 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#006.md), [Psa
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#007.md). The voice of God is heard by the
forgiven one in [Psa 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#008.md), [Psa
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#009.md); and the Psalm then concludes
with a portion for each of the two great classes of men, [Psa
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#010.md), [Psa
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#011.md).

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Title

The term Maschil is prefixed to thirteen Psalms. Our translators have
not ventured to do more, in the text, than simply print the word in
English characters; in the margin however they render it, as the Geneva
version had done before them, "to give instruction." It would be going
too far to affirm that this interpretation is subject to no doubt. Some
good Hebraists take exception to it; so that, perhaps, our venerable
translators did well to leave it untranslated. Still, the interpretation
they have set down in the margin, as it is the most ancient, so it is
sustained by the great preponderance of authority. It agrees remarkably
with the contents of the [Psa 32:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md),
which affords the earliest instance of its use, for that Psalm is
pre-eminently didactic. Its scope is to instruct the convicted soul how
to obtain peace with God, and be compassed about with songs of
deliverance. - William Binnie, D.D., in "The Psalms: their History,
Teachings, and Use," 1870.

Whole Psalm

This is a Didascalic Psalm, wherein David reacheth sinners to repent by
his doctrine, who taught them to sin by his example. This science is
universal and pertaineth to all men, and which necessarily we must all
learn; princes, priests, people, men, women, children, tradesmen; all, I
say, must be put to this school, without which lesson all others are
unprofitable. But to the point. This is a mark of a true penitent, when
he hath been a stumbling block to others, to be as careful to raise them
up by his repentance as he was hurtful to them by his sin; and I never
think that man truly penitent who is ashamed to teach sinners
repentance, by his own particular proof. The Samaritan woman, when she
was converted, left her bucket at the well, entered the city, and said,
"Come forth, yonder is a man who hath told me all that I have done." And
our Saviour saith to St. Peter, "When thou art converted, strengthen thy
brethren." [Joh 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#029.md); [Luk
22:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#032.md). St. Paul also, after his
conversion is not ashamed to call himself chiefest of all sinners, and
to teach others to repent of their sins by repenting for his own. Happy,
and thrice happy, is the man who can build so much as he hath cast down.
- Archibald Symson.

Whole Psalm

It is told of Luther that one day being asked which of all the Psalms
were the best, he made answer, "Psalmi Paulini," and when his friends
pressed to know which these might be, he said, "The [Psa
32:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md), the 51st, the [Psa
130:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#001.md), and [Psa
143:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#001.md). For they all teach that the
forgiveness of our sins comes, without the law and without works, to the
man who believes, and therefore I call them Pauline Psalms; and David
sings, 'There is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared,'
this is just what Paul says, 'God hath concluded them all in unbelief,
that he might have mercy upon all.' [Rom
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#032.md). Thus no man may boast of his
own righteousness. That word, 'That thou mayest be feared,' dusts away
all merit, and teaches us to uncover our heads before God, and confess
gratia est, non meritum: remissio, non satisfactio; it is mere
forgiveness, not merit at all." - Luther's Table Talk.

Some assert that this Psalm used to be sung on the day of expiation. -

The Penitential Psalms

When Galileo was imprisoned by the Inquisition at Rome, for asserting
the Copernican System, he was enjoined, as a penance, to repeat the
Seven Penitential Psalms every week for three years. This must have been
intended as extorting a sort of confession from him of his guilt, and
acknowledgment of the justice of his sentence; and in which there
certainly was some cleverness and, indeed, humour, however adding to the
iniquity (or foolishness) of the proceeding. Otherwise it is not easy to
understand what idea of painfulness or punishment the good fathers could
attach to a devotional exercise such as this, which, in whatever way,
could only have been agreeable and consoling to their prisoner. - M.
Montague, in The Seven Penitential Psalms in Verse.... with an Appendix
and Notes," 1844.

[Psa 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md)

"Blessed." Or. O blessed man; or, Oh, the felicities of that man! to
denote the most supreme and perfect blessedness. As the elephant, to
denote its vast bulk, is spoken of in the plural number, Behemoth. -
Robert Leighton.

[Psa 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md)

Notice, this is the first Psalm, except the first of all, which begins
with Blessedness. In the[Psa 1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md) we
have the blessing of innocence, or rather, of him who only was innocent:
here we have the blessing of repentance, as the next happiest state to
that of sinlessness. - Lorinus, in Neale's Commentary.

[Psa 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md)

"Blessed is the man," saith David, "whose sins are pardoned," where he
maketh remission of sins to be true felicity. Now there is no true
felicity but that which is enjoyed, and felicity cannot be enjoyed
unless it be felt; and it cannot be felt unless a man know himself to be
in possession of it; and a man cannot know himself to be in possession
of it, if he doubt whether he hath it or not; and therefore this
doubting of the remission of sins is contrary to true felicity, and is
nothing else but a torment of the conscience. For a man cannot doubt
whether his sins be pardoned or not, but straightway, if his conscience
be not seared with a hot iron, the very thought of his sin will strike a
great fear into him; for the fear of eternal death, and the horror of
God's judgment will come to his remembrance, the consideration of which
is most terrible. - William Perkins.

[Psa 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md)

"Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered."
Get your sins hid. There is a covering of sin which proves a curse. [Pro
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#013.md). "He that covereth his sins
shall not prosper;" there is a covering it, by not confessing it, or
which is worse, by denying it - Gehazi's covering - a covering of sin by
a lie; and there is also a covering of sin by justifying ourselves in
it. I have not done this thing; or, I did no evil in it. All these are
evil coverings: he that thus covereth his sin shall not prosper. But
there is a blessed covering of sin: forgiveness of sin is the hiding it
out of sight, and that is the blessedness. - Richard Alleine.

[Psa 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md)

"Whose transgression is forgiven." We may lull the soul asleep with
carnal delights, but the virtue of that opium will be soon spent. All
those joys are but stolen waters, and bread eaten in secret - a poor
sorry peace that dares not come to the light and endure the trial; a
sorry peace that is soon disturbed by a few serious and sober thoughts
of God and the world to come; but when once sin is pardoned, then you
have true joy indeed. "Be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee."
[Mat 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#002.md). - Thomas Manton.

[Psa 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md)

"Forgiven." Holy David, in the front of this Psalm shows us wherein true
happiness consists; not in beauty, honour, riches (the world's trinity),
but in the forgiveness of sin. The Hebrew word to forgive, signifies to
carry out of sight; which well agrees with that [Jer
50:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#020.md), "In those days, saith the Lord,
the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and
the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found." This is an
incomprehensible blessing, and such as lays a foundation for all other
mercies. I shall but glance at it, and lay down these five assertions
about it. 1. Forgiveness is an act of God's free grace. The Greek word
to forgive, deciphers the original of pardon; it ariseth not from
anything inherent in us, but is the pure result of free grace. [Isa
43:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#025.md) : "I, even I, am he that
blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake." When a creditor
forgives a debtor, he doeth it freely. Paul cries out, "I obtained
mercy." [Ti1 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#013.md). The Greek
signifies, "I was be-mercied;" he who is pardoned, is all bestrewed with
mercy. When the Lord pardons a sinner, he doth not pay a debt, but give
a legacy. 2. God in forgiving sin, remits the guilt and penalty. Guilt
cries for justice: no sooner had Adam eaten the apple, but he saw the
flaming sword, and heard the curse; but in remission God doth indulge
the sinner; he seems to say thus to him: Though thou art fallen into the
hands of my justice, and deservest to die, yet I will absolve thee, and
whatever is charged upon thee shall be discharged. 3. Forgiveness of sin
is through the blood of Christ. Free grace is the impulsive cause;
Christ's blood is the meritorious. "Without shedding of blood is no
remission." [Heb 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#022.md). Justice would
be revenged either on the sinner or the surety. Every pardon is the
price of blood. 4. Before sin is forgiven it must be repented of.
Therefore repentance and remission are linked together. "That repentance
and remission of sins should be preached in his name." [Luk
24:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#047.md). Not that repentance doth in a
Popish sense merit forgiveness; Christ's blood must wash our tears; but
repentance is a qualification, though not a cause. He who is humbled for
sin will the more value pardoning mercy. 5. God having forgiven sin, he
will call it no more into remembrance. [Jer
31:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#034.md). The Lord will make an act of
indemnity, he will not upbraid us with former unkindnesses, or sue us
with a cancelled bond. "He will cast all our sins into the depths of the
sea." [Mic 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#019.md). Sin shall not be cast
in as a cork which riseth up again, but as lead which sinks to the
bottom. How should we all labour for this covenant blessing! - Thomas
Watson.

[Psa 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md)

"Sin is covered." Every man that must be happy, must have something to
hide and cover his sins from God's eyes; and nothing in the world can do
it, but Christ and his righteousness, typified in the ark of the
covenant, whose cover was of gold, and called a propitiatory, that as it
covered the tables that were within the ark, so God covers our sins
against those tables. So the cloud covering the Israelites in the
wilderness, signified God's covering us from the danger of our sins. -
Thomas Taylor's "David's Learning: or the Way to True Happinesse," 1617.

[Psa 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md)

"Sin covered." This covering hath relation to some nakedness and
filthiness which should be covered, even sin, which defileth us and
maketh us naked. Why, saith Moses to Aaron, hast thou made the people
naked? [Exo 32:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#025.md). The garments of our
merits are too short and cannot cover us, we have need therefore to
borrow of Christ Jesus his merits and the mantle of his righteousness,
that it may be unto us as a garment, and as those breeches of leather
which God made unto Adam and Eve after their fall. Garments are ordained
to cover our nakedness, defend us from the injury of the weather, and to
adorn us. So the mediation of our Saviour serveth to cover our
nakedness, that the wrath of God seize not upon us - he is that "white
raiment" wherewith we should be clothed, that our filthy nakedness may
not appear - to defend us against Satan - he is "mighty to save," etc. -
and to be an ornament to decorate us, for he is that "wedding garment:"
"Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ." [Rev
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#018.md); [Isa
63:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001.md); [Mat
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#011.md); [Rom
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#014.md). - Archibald Symson.

[Psa 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md)

The object of pardon - about which it is conversant, is set forth under
divers expressions - iniquity, transgression, and sin. As in law, many
words of like import and signification are heaped up and put together,
to make the deed and legal instrument more comprehensive and effectual.
I observe it the rather, because when God proclaims his name the same
words are used, [Exo 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#007.md), "Taking
away iniquity, transgression, and sin." Well, we have seen the meaning
of the expression. Why doth the holy man of God use such rigour and
vehemency of inculcation, "Blessed is the man!" and again, "Blessed is
the man!" Partly with respect to his own case. David knew how sweet it
was to have sin pardoned; he had felt the bitterness of sin in his own
soul, to the drying up of his blood, and therefore he doth express his
sense of pardon in the most lively terms. And then, partly, too, with
respect to those for whose use this instruction was written, that they
might not look upon it as a light and trivial thing, but be thoroughly
apprehensive of the worth of so great a privilege. Blessed, happy,
thrice happy they who have obtained pardon of their sins, and
justification by Jesus Christ. - Thomas Manton.

[Psa 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md), [Psa
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#002.md)

In these verses four evils are mentioned: 1. Transgression, פשׁע pesha.
2. Sin, חמאה chataah. 3. Iniquity, עון avon. 4. Guile, דמוּה remiyah.
The first signifies the passing over a boundary, doing what is
prohibited. The second signifies the missing of a mark, not doing what
was commanded; but it is often taken to express sinfulness, or sin in
the nature, producing transgression in the life. The third signifies
what is turned out of its proper course or situation; anything morally
distorted or perverted. Iniquity, what is contrary to equity or justice.
The fourth signifies fraud, deceit, guile, etc. To remove these evils,
three acts are mentioned: forgiving, covering, and not imputing. 1.
Transgression, פשׁע pesha, must be forgiven, גשׂוּי nesui, borne away,
i.e., by a vicarious sacrifice; for bearing sin, or bearing away sin,
always implies this. 2. Sinחמאה chataah, must be covered, כּמוּי kesui,
hidden from the sight. It is odious and abominable, and must be put out
of sight. 3. Iniquityעון avon, what is perverse or distorted, must not
be imputed, לא יחשב lo yachshobh, must not be reckoned to his account.
4. Guile., דמוּה remiyah, must be annihilated from the soul. In whose
spirit there is no guile. The man whose transgression is forgiven; whose
sin is hidden, God having cast it as a millstone into the depths of the
sea; whose iniquity and perversion is not reckoned to his account; and
whose guile, the deceitful and desperately wicked heart, is annihilated,
being emptied of sin, and filled with righteousness, is necessarily a
happy man. - Adam Clarke.

[Psa 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md), [Psa
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#002.md)

Transgression. Prevarication. Some understand by it sins of omission and
commission.

Sin. Some understand those inward inclinations, lusts, and motions,
whereby the soul swerves from the law of God, and which are the
immediate cause of external sins.

Iniquity. Notes original sin, the root of all.

Levatus, forgiven, eased, signifies to take away, to bear, to carry
away. Two words in Scripture are chiefly used to denote remission, to
expiate, to bear or carry away: the one signifies the manner whereby it
is done, namely, atonement, the other the effect of this expiation,
carrying away; one notes the meritorious cause, the other the
consequent.

Covered. Alluding to the covering of the Egyptians in the Red Sea.
Menochius thinks it alludes to the manner of writing among the Hebrews,
which he thinks to be the same with that of the Romans; as writing with
a pencil upon wax spread upon tables, which when they would blot out
they made the wax plain, and drawing it over the writing, covered the
former letters. And so it is equivalent with that expression of
"blotting out sin," as in the other allusion it is with "casting sin
into the depths of the sea."

Impute. Not charging upon account. As sin is a defection from the law,
so it is forgiven; as it is offensive to God's holiness, so it is
covered; as it is a debt involving man in a debt of punishment, so it is
not imputed; they all note the certainty, and extent, and perfection of
pardon; the three words expressing sin here, being the same that are
used by God in the declaration of his name. - Stephen Charnock.

[Psa 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md), [Psa
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#002.md), [Psa
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#006.md), [Psa
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#007.md)

Who is blessed? Not he who cloaks, conceals, confesses not his sin. As
long as David was in this state he was miserable. There was guile in his
spirit ([Psa 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#002).md), misery in his
heart, his very bones waxed old, his moisture was dried up as the
drought in summer ([Psa 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#003.md), [Psa
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#004).md). Who is blessed? He that is
without sin, he who sins not, he who grieves no more by his sin the
bosom on which he reclines. This is superlative blessedness, its highest
element, the happiness of heaven. To be like God, to yield implicit,
ready, full, perfect obedience, the obedience of the heart, of our
entire being; this is to be blessed above all blessedness. But among
those who live in a world of sin, who are surrounded by sin, who are
themselves sinners, who is blessed? "He whose transgression is forgiven,
whose sin is covered, to whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity;" and
especially does he feel it to be so, who can, in some degree, enter into
the previous state of David's soul ([Psa
32:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#003.md), [Psa
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#004).md). Ah, in what a wretched state
was the Psalmist previously to this blessedness! How must sin have
darkened and deadened his spiritual faculties, to have guile in the
spirit of one who could elsewhere exclaim, "Search me, O God, and know
my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: and see if there be any wicked
way in me," any way of pain or grief, any way of sin which most surely
leads to these. [Psa 139:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#023.md), [Psa
139:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#024.md). What a mournful condition of
soul was his, who while he roared all the day long, yet kept silence
before God, had no heart to open his heart unto God, was dumb before
him, not in submission to his will, not in accepting the punishment of
his iniquity ([Lev 26:46](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#046).md), not in real
confession, and honest, upright, and sincere acknowledgment of his
iniquity to him against whom he had committed it. "I kept silence," not
merely I was silent, "I kept silence," resolutely, perseveringly; I kept
it notwithstanding all the remembrance of my past mercies,
notwithstanding my reproaches of conscience, and my anguish of heart. I
kept it notwithstanding "thy hand was heavy upon me day and night,"
notwithstanding "my moisture," all that was spiritual in me, my vital
spirit, all that was indicative of spiritual life in my soul, seemed
dried up and gone. Yes, Lord, notwithstanding all this, I kept it. But
Nathan came, thou didst send him. He was to me a messenger full of
reproof, full of faithfulness, but full of love. He came with thy word,
and with the word of a King there was power. I acknowledged my sin unto
him, and my iniquity did I not hide, but this was little. Against thee,
thee only, did I sin, and to thee was my confession made. I acknowledged
my sin unto thee, O Lord. I solemnly said that I would do so, and I did
it. I confessed my transgression unto the Lord, "and thou forgavest the
iniquity of my sin."

"Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven." Behold the man who is
blessed; blessed in the state of his mind, his guileless spirit, his
contrite heart, the fruit of the spirit of grace; blessed in the
forgiveness of a forgiving God; a forgiveness, perfect, entire, lacking
nothing, signified by sin "covered," "iniquity not imputed" of the Lord;
blessed in the blessings which followed it. "Thou art my hiding place;
thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with
songs of deliverance." Beneath the hollow of that hand which was once so
heavy upon me, I can now repose. Thou art my hiding place, I dread thee
no more; nay, I dwell in thee as my habitation, and my high tower, my
covert, my safety, my house. Safe in thy love, whatever trouble may be
my portion, and by the mouth of Nathan thy servant thou hast declared
that trouble shall be my portion, I shall yet be preserved; yea, more,
so fully wilt thou deliver me that I believe thou wilt encompass me so
with the arms of thy mercy, as to call forth songs of grateful praise
for thy gracious interposition.

Behold the blessedness of him whom God forgives! No wonder, then, that
the Psalmist adds, "for this shall every one that is godly pray unto
thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great
waters they shall not come nigh unto him." As much as if he said, Surely
after this thy gracious conduct towards me, all that truly love and fear
thee, "every one that is godly," when he hears of thy dealings with me,
"will pray unto thee." Encouraged by my example, he will not keep
silence as I foolishly and sinfully did, but will confess and supplicate
before thee, since thou art to be "found," and hast so wondrously shown
that thou art, of all that truly seek thee, since there is the place of
finding, as I lay my hand upon the victim, and look through that victim
to him the promised Seed; since there is the time of finding, declared
in thy word, and manifested by the secret drawing of my heart to thee by
thy grace: since the unwillingness is not in thee, but in thy sinning
creature to come to thee; "for this shall every one that is godly pray
unto thee," then, however deep the waterfloods may be, however fierce
the torrent, and headlong the stream, they shall not even come nigh unto
him, much less shall they overwhelm him. - James Herrington Evans, M.A.,
1785-1849.

[Psa 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#002.md)

"Unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity." Aben-Ezra paraphrases it, of
whose sins God does not think, does not regard them, so as to bring them
into judgment, reckoning them as if they were not; οὐ μὴ λογοιζεται does
not count or calculate them; does not require for them the debt of
punishment. To us the remission is entirely free, our Sponsor having
taken upon him the whole business of paying the ransom. His suffering is
our impunity, his bond our freedom, and his chastisement our peace; and
therefore the prophet says, "The chastisement of our peace was upon him,
and by his stripes we are healed." - Robert Leighton.

[Psa 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#002.md)

"In whose spirit there is no guile." In the saint's trouble, conscience
is full of Scripture sometimes, on which it grounds its verdict, but
very ill interpreted. Oh, saith the poor soul, this place is against me!
"Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in
whose spirit there is no guile." Here, saith he, is a description of a
sincere soul, to be one in whose spirit there is no guile; but I find
much guile in me, therefore I am not the sincere one. Now this is a very
weak yea, false inference. By a spirit without guile, is not meant a
person that hath not the least deceitfulness and hypocrisy remaining in
his heart. To be without sin, and to be without guile, in this strict
sense are the same - a prerogative here on earth peculiar to the Lord
Christ ([Pe1 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#022).md), "Who did no sin,
neither was guile found in his mouth." And therefore when we meet with
the same phrase attributed to the saints, as to Levi, [Mal
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#006.md) : "Iniquity was not found in his
lips;" and to Nathanael, [Joh 1:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#047.md) :
"Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!" we must sense it in
an inferior way, that may suit with their imperfect state here below,
and not put that which was only Christ's crown on earth, and is the
glorified saint's robe in heaven, on the weak Christian while militant
here on earth, not only with a devil without, but with a body of sin
within him. Wipe thine eyes again, poor soul, and then if thou readest
such places, wherein the Spirit of God speaks so highly and
hyperbolically of his saints' grace, thou shalt find he doth not assert
the perfection of their grace, free from all mixture of sin, but rather
to comfort poor drooping souls, and cross their misgiving hearts, which,
from the presence of hypocrisy, are ready to overlook their sincerity as
none at all, he expresseth his high esteem of their little grace, by
speaking of it as if it were perfect, and their hypocrisy none at all. -
William Gurnall.

[Psa 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#002.md)

"In whose spirit there is no guile." When once pardon is realised the
believer has courage to be truthful before God: he can afford to have
done with "guile" in the spirit. Who would not declare all his debts
when they are certain to be discharged by another? Who would not declare
his malady when he was sure of a cure? True faith knows not only that
"guile" before God is impossible, but also that it is no longer
necessary. The believer has nothing to conceal: he sees himself as
before God, stripped, and laid open, and bare; and if he has learned to
see himself as he is, so also has he learned to see God as he reveals
himself. There is no guile in the spirit of one who is justified by
faith; because in the act of justification truth has been established in
his inward parts. There is no guile in the spirit of him who sees the
truth of himself in the light of the truth of God. For the truth of God
shows him at once that in Christ he is perfectly righteous before God,
and in himself he is the chief of sinners. Such a one knows he is not
his own, for he is bought with a price, and therefore he is to glorify
God. There is no guile in the spirit of him whose real object is to
glorify Christ and not himself. But when a man is not quite true to
Christ, and has not quite ceased to magnify self, there may be guile,
for he will be more occupied with thoughts about himself than with the
honour of Christ. But if the truth, and honour, and glory of Christ be
his supreme care, he may leave himself out of the question, and, like
Christ, "commit himself to him that judgeth righteously." - J. W. Reeve,
M.A., in "Lectures on the Thirty-second Psalm," 1860.

[Psa 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#002.md)

"No guile." Sincerity is that property to which pardoning mercy is
annexed. True, indeed, it is that Christ covers all our sins and
failings; but it is only the sincere soul over which he will cast his
skirt. "Blessed is he whose sin is covered. Blessed is the man unto whom
the Lord imputeth not iniquity." None will doubt this; but which is the
man? The next words tell us his name; "And in whose spirit there is no
guile." Christ's righteousness is the garment which covers the nakedness
and shame of our unrighteousness; faith the grace that puts this garment
on; but what faith? None but the faith unfeigned, as Paul calls it. [Ti2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#005.md). "Here is water," said the eunuch,
"what doth hinder me to be baptized?" [Act
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#036.md). Now mark Philip's answer, ver.
37: "If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest;" as if he had
said, Nothing but an hypocritical heart can hinder thee. It is the false
heart only that finds the door of mercy shut. - William Gurnall.

[Psa 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#002.md)

"Guile." The guile of the spirit is an inward corruption in the soul of
man, whereby he dealeth deceitfully with himself before God in the
matter of salvation. - Thomas Taylor.

[Psa 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#003.md)

"My bones waxed old." God sporteth not at the sins of his elect, but
outwardly doth deal with them more hardly, and chastise them more
rigorously than he doth the reprobate. David's troubles and pains were
partly external, partly internal; external I call those that were cast
on his body; internal upon his conscience. And in the body there were
torments and vexations, seizing sometimes on his flesh - which was less
painful - sometimes on his bones, which was more grievous, yea, almost
intolerable, as experience teacheth. And this is God's just recompence;
when we bestow our strength on sin, God abateth it, and so weakeneth us.
Samson spent his strength on Delilah, but to what weakness was he
brought! Let us, therefore, learn, that God hath given us bones and the
strength thereof for another use, that is, to serve him, and not waste
or be prodigal of them in the devil's service. - Archibald Symson.

[Psa 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#003.md)

"My bones waxed old." By bones, the strength of the body, the inward
strength and rigour of the soul is meant. The conscience of sin, and the
terror of judgment doth break the heart of a true penitent, so long as
he beholdeth his sin deserving death, his judge ready to pronounce the
sentence of it, hell open to receive him for it, and the evil angels,
God's executioners, at hand to hurry him to it. - Samuel Page, in
"David's Broken Heart," 1646.

[Psa 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#003.md)

"My bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long." David here not
only mourns for sin as a man, but he roars, as it were, like a pained
beast. He seems fitter for a wilderness to cry out, than for a secret
chamber to weep in; at other times he can "water his couch" in the
night, now he "roars" all the day long; at other times "his moisture is
dried," now his "bones," the pillars of his house, shake and wax old. -
Alexander Carmichael, 1677.

[Psa 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#004.md)

"Thy hand." A correcting hand, whereby God scourgeth and buffeteth his
own children. Now the sense of God's power punishing or correcting, is
called God's hand, as [Sa1 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#011.md). The
hand of God was sore at Ekron, because of the ark; and a heavy hand in
resemblance, because when men smite they lay their hand heavier than
ordinary. Hence, we may note three points of doctrine: first, that all
afflictions are God's hand; secondly, that God lays his hand heavily
often upon his dear children; thirdly, that God often continues his
heavy hand night and day on them. - Thomas Taylor.

[Psa 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#004.md)

"My moisture is turned into the drought of summer." Another meaning may
be attributed to these words. We may suppose the Psalmist to be
referring to spiritual drought. - Charles H. Bingham, B.A in "Lectures
on the Thirty-second Psalm," 1836.

[Psa 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#004.md)

"My moisture is turned into the drought of summer." The summer is from
the middle of August to the middle of November. The intensity of the
heat is great, and almost intolerable... Up to the beginning or middle
of September there are no showers, rain being as scarce in summer as
snow.... The dry grass of the fields sometimes takes fire, and produces
desolating conflagrations, and the parched earth is cleft and broken
into chasms. - John Eadie, D.D., LL.D., in Biblical Cyclopaedia, 1868.

[Psa 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#004.md)

"The drought of summer." Dr. Russell, in his account of the weather at
Aleppo, which very much resembles that of Judaea, says that the verdure
of the spring fades before the middle of May, and before the end of that
month the whole country puts on so parched and barren an aspect that one
would scarce think it capable of producing anything, there being but
very few plants that have rigour enough to resist the extreme heat. -
Thomas Harmer's "Observations," 1775.

[Psa 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#004.md)

"The drought of summer." During the twelve years from 1846 to 1859 only
two slight showers fell in Jerusalem between the months of May and
October. One fell in July, 1858, another in June, 1859. - Dr. Whitly's
"Water Supply of Jerusalem," quoted in Kitto's Cyclopaedia.

[Psa 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#004.md)

If God striketh those so sore whom he favoureth, how sharply and sore
will he strike them whom he favoureth not. - Gregory.

[Psa 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#004.md), [Psa
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#005.md)

If our offences have been not gnats, but camels, our sorrow must be not
a drop, but an ocean. Scarlet sins call for bloody tears; and if Peter
sin heinously he must weep bitterly. If, then, thy former life hath been
a cord of iniquity, twisted with many threads, a writing full of great
blots, a course spotted with various and grievous sins, multiply thy
confessions and enlarge thy humiliation; double thy fastings and treble
thy prayers; pour out thy tears, and fetch deep sighs; in a word,
iterate and aggravate thy acknowledgments, though yet, as the apostle
saith in another case, I say in this, "Grieve not as without hope," that
upon thy sincere and suitable repentance divine goodness will forgive
thee thy sins. - Nathanael Hardy.

[Psa 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#005.md)

"Selah." See notes on 3:2;, 3:2, 4, 8; 4:2, 20:3.

[Psa 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#005.md)

"I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid." The
godly man is ingenuous in laying open his sins. The hypocrite doth vail
and smother his sin; he doth not abscindere peccatum, but abscondere;
like a patient that hath some loathsome disease in his body, he will
rather die than confess his disease; but a godly man's sincerity is seen
in this - he will confess and shame himself for sin. "Lo, I have sinned,
and I have done wickedly." [Sa2 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#017.md).
Nay a child of God will confess sin in particular; an unsound Christian
will confess sin by wholesale; he will acknowledge he is a sinner in
general, whereas David doth, as it were, point with his finger to the
sore. "I have done this evil" ([Psa
51:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004).md); he doth not say I have done
evil, but this evil he points at his blood-guiltiness. - Thomas Watson.

[Psa 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#005.md)

"I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and thou
forgavest the iniquity of my sin." Be thine own accuser in the free
confession of thy sins. Peccavi pater (as the prodigal child), "Father,
I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight." For it fares not in the
court of heaven as it doth in our earthly tribunals. With men a free
confession makes way for a condemnation; but with God, the more a sinner
bemoans his offence the more be extenuates the anger of his Judge. Sin
cannot but call for justice, as it is an offence against God; yet, when
once 'tis a wound to the soul it moveth him to mercy and clemency.
Wherefore, as David having but resolved to confess his sins, was
accosted eftsoon with an absolution: so, Tu agnosce, et Dominus
ignoscet. Be thou unfeigned in confessing, and God will be faithful in
forgiving. [Jo1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009.md). Only let
confessio peccati be professio desinendi - the acknowledgment of thy sin
an obligation to leave it; and then thou mayest build upon it. "He that
confesseth and forsaketh shall have mercy." [Pro
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#013.md). - Isaac Craven's Sermon at
Paul's Cross, 1630.

[Psa 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#005.md)

"I said, I will confess," etc. Justified persons, who have their sins
forgiven, are yet bound to confess sin to God.... There are many queries
to be dispatched in the handling of this point. The first query, is,
what are the reasons why persons justified and pardoned are yet bound to
make confession of sin unto God in private? The reasons are six. First,
they are to confess sin unto God because holy confession gives a great
deal of ease and holy quiet unto the mind of a sinner: concealed and
indulged guilt constracts horror and dread on the conscience. Secondly,
because God loves to hear the complaints and the confessions of his own
people. Lying on the face is the best gesture, and the mourning weed the
best garment that God is well pleased with. A third reason is, because
confession of sin doth help to quicken the heart to strong and earnest
supplication to God (see [Psa 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#006).md).
Confession is to the soul as the whetstone is to the knife, that
sharpens it and puts an edge on it; so doth confession of sin.
Confessing thy evils to God doth sharpen and put an edge on thy
supplication; that man will pray but faintly that doth confess sin but
slightly. A fourth reason is, because confession of sin will work a holy
contrition and a godly sorrow in the heart. ([Psa
38:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#018).md). Declaration doth work
compunction. Confession of sin is but the causing of sin to recoil on
the conscience, which causeth blushing and shame of face, and grief of
heart. A fifth reason is, because secret confession of sin doth give a
great deal of glory to God. It gives glory to God's justice. I do
confess sin, and do confess God in justice may damn me for my sin. It
gives glory to God's mercy. I confess sin, yet mercy may save me. It
gives glory to God's omnisciency. In confessing sin I do acknowledge
that God knoweth my sin. A sixth reason why justified persons must
confess sin unto God is, because holy confession of sin will embitter
sin, and endear Christ to them, when a man shall let sin recoil on his
conscience by a confession. - Condensed from Christopher Love's "Soul's
Cordiall," 1683.

[Psa 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#005.md)

"I said I will confess.... and thou forgavest." It remaineth as a truth,
remission is undoubtedly annexed to confession. Tantum valent tres
syllablae Pec-ca-vi, saith St. Austin, of so great force are those three
syllables in the Latin, three words in the English, when uttered with a
contrite heart, "I have sinned." - Nathanael Hardy.

[Psa 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#005.md)

"Thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin." This sin seems very probably to
have been his adultery with Bathsheba, and murder of Uriah. Now David to
make the pardoning mercy of God more illustrious, saith he did not only
forgive his sin, but the iniquity of his sin; and what was that? Surely
the worst that can be said of that, his complicated sin, is that there
was so much hypocrisy in it, he woefully juggled with God and man in it;
this, I do not doubt to say, was the iniquity of his sin, and put a
colour deeper on it than the blood which he shed. And the rather - I lay
the accent there - because God himself, when he would set out the
heinousness of this sin, seems to do it rather from the hypocrisy in the
fact than the fact itself, as appears by the testimony given this holy
man ([Kg1 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#005).md): "David did that which
was right in the eyes of the Lord, and turned not aside from anything
that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter
of Uriah the Hittite." Were there not other false steps which David took
besides this? Doth the Spirit of God, by excepting this, declare his
approbation of all that else he ever did? No, sure the Spirit of God
records other sins that escaped this eminent servant of the Lord; but
all those are drowned here, and this mentioned as the only stain of his
life. But why? Surely because there appeared less sincerity, yea, more
hypocrisy in this one sin than in all his others put together; though
David in them was wrong as to the matter of his actions, yet his heart
was more right in the manner of committing them. But here his sincerity
was sadly wounded, though not to the total destruction of the habit, yet
to lay it in a long swoon, as to any actings thereof. And truly the
wound went very deep when that grace was stabbed in which did run the
life blood of all the rest. We see, then, God hath reason, though his
mercy prompted him, yea, his covenant obliged him, not to let his child
die of this wound, yet so to heal it that a scar might remain upon the
place, a mark upon the sin, whereby others might know how odious
hypocrisy is to God. - William Gurnall.

[Psa 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#005.md)

"Thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin." We must observe the matter
forgiven, and the manner of forgiving. The matter forgiven is the
iniquity of his sin. It is disputed what is meant here by iniquity,
whether culpa or poena. Some understand poenam, and think that an
allusion is made in this word unto the message of Nathan, wherein God
doth remit the heaviest stroke of his wrath, but yet retains some part
in punishing the child, and permitting Absalom to rebel and abuse king
David's concubines: so Theodoret, Deus non condigna poena Davidem
punivit. Some understand culpam, and will have this phrase to be an
amplification of that, as if superbia defendens, or taciturnitas celans,
or impietas contra Deum assurgens, or some such great guilt were meant
by this phrase. But as I do not censure these opinions, which may well
stand, so I think the phrase looks back unto that word which was in the
confession. The sin confessed was פּשׁע, and this is but an analysis of
this word; for עון חמּאהי, what is it, word for word, but the
perverseness of my aberration? חמאה is an aberration from the scope or
mark whereat we aim; all men aim at felicity, but most men stray from
it, because they are not led by the law that guides unto it, the
violating whereof is called חמאה. But some do stray out of mere
ignorance, and they only break the law; some out of stubbornness, which
will not submit themselves to the Lawgiver; these men's sin is called
perverseness, which God is said here to forgive. So that David did not
confess more against himself than God includes in his pardon. Well may
God exceed our desire; he never doth come short thereof if it do concern
our spiritual, our eternal good. As he doth exclude no sinner that doth
confess, so doth he except against no sin that is confessed. - Arthur
Lake.

[Psa 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#006.md)

"For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when
thou mayest be found," etc. Seeing he is such a God, who should refuse
or delay his return! Surely every rational and pious mind will, without
delay, invoke so gentle and mild a Lord; will pray to him while he is
exorable, or, as the Hebrew expresses it, in a time of finding. For he
who promises pardon, does not promise tomorrow. There are tempora fandi
- certain times in which he may be spoken with, and a certain appointed
day of pardon and of grace, which if a man by stupid perverseness
despise, or by sloth neglect, surely he is justly overwhelmed with
eternal might and misery, and must necessarily perish by the deluge of
divine wrath; since he has contemned and derided that Ark of salvation
which was prepared and in which whoever enters into it shall be safe,
while the world is perishing. - Robert Leighton.

[Psa 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#006.md)

"For this shall every one that is godly pray to thee," said David. "For
this!" What? Because of his sins. And who? Not the wickedest, but the
"godly," in this respect, have cause to pray. And for what should he
pray? Surely, for renewed pardon, for increase of grace, and for the
perfection of glory. We cannot say we have no sin. Oh then, let us pray
with David, "Enter not into judgment with thy servant, O Lord!" Where
there is a double emphasis observable it is not ab hoste, but a servo.
Though God's servant, yet he would not have God to enter into judgment
with him. And again, ne intres, it is the very entrance into judgment
that he dreads and prayeth against; not only do not proceed, but not so
much as enter. - Nathanael Hardy.

[Psa 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#006.md)

"For this shall every one that is godly." We are here furnished with a
fact which does not appear in the history of David. It is commonly
supposed that after his grievous fall, till Nathan reproved him, he had
been careless and stupefied; and this has often been adduced as a proof
of the hardening nature of sin. But the thing was far otherwise. He was
all the while tortured in his mind yet unwilling to humble himself
before God, and condemn himself before men, as he ought to have done. He
kept silence, and endeavoured to pass off the distress by time,
palliation, and excuse. But the repression and concealment of his
anguish preyed not only upon his peace, but his health, and endangered
life itself. At length he was reduced to the deepest penitence, and
threw himself, by an unqualified confession, on the compassion of God.
"For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee." Here we see not
only that all the godly pray, but every one of them prays for pardon.
This is the very thing which our Saviour teaches his disciples: "When ye
pray, say, Forgive us our trespasses." And this praying does not only
regard the manifestation of forgiving mercy, as some would have it but
the exercise of it. - William Jay.

[Psa 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#006.md)

"Godly." A godly man is like God, he hath the same judgment with God! he
thinks of things as God doth; he hath a God-like disposition; he
partakes of the divine nature. [Pe2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#004.md). A godly man doth bear God's name
and image: godliness is Godlikeness. - Thomas Watson.

"A time." There be seasons, which, if taken, sweeten actions, and open
the door for their better entertainment: [Pro
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#011.md), "A word fitly spoken is like
apples of gold in pictures of silver;" the Hebrew is, A word spoken upon
its wheels: fit times and seasons are wheels to carry words with great
advantage. And so for actions; when things are done in due time they are
beautiful, acceptable. When God gives rain to a land in season, how
acceptable is it! when a tree bears fruit in its season, it is grateful:
so when angels or men do things seasonably, it is pleasing to the Lord
Christ; there are fit times, which, if we miss, actions are unlovely,
and miss of their aims. "For this shall every one that is godly pray
unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found." There are times, if we
have the wisdom to discern them, when prayer will be seasonable,
acceptable, effectual. - William Greenhill.

[Psa 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#006.md)

"Surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto
him." The effects of prayer heretofore have been wonderful. Prayer hath
sent down hailstones from heaven to overcome five kings with their
armies. Prayer hath shut up the windows of heaven that it should not
rain, and again hath opened them that the earth might give her increase.
Prayer hath stayed the swift course of the sun and caused it to go
backward fifteen degrees. Prayer hath held God's hands that he could not
strike when he was ready to plague his people. Prayer without any other
help or means hath thrown down the strong walls of Jericho. Prayer hath
divided the sea that the floods thereof could not come near the
Israelites. In this place it delivereth the faithful man from all the
dangers of this world. "Surely in the floods of many waters they shall
not come nigh unto him." The sum is this, That no calamity of this
world, no troubles of this life, no terrors of death, no guiltiness of
sin, can be so great, but that a "godly" man by means of his faith and
felicity in Christ shall wade out of them well enough. For howsoever
other things go, still he shall have such a solace in his soul, such a
comfort in his conscience, such a heaven in his heart, knowing himself
reconciled to God and justified by faith, that "Surely in the floods of
many waters they shall not come nigh unto him." Which, that it may
better appear, I shall desire you to observe two things, the danger, the
deliverance. The danger is in these words, "In the floods of many
waters;" where the tribulations that the godly man is subject to in this
life are likened, first, to waters; then, to many waters; thirdly, to a
flood of many waters. The deliverance is in these words, "Surely they
shall not come near him;" where the deliverance of the godly man hath
three degrees also. First, "they shall not come near;" secondly, him,
"they shall not come near him;" then, surely - "surely they shall not
come near him." - Thomas Playfere.

[Psa 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#006.md)

"The floods of great waters." The afflictions of the faithful are
likened to waters. Fire and water have no mercy, we say. But of the two
water is the worst. For any fire may be quenched with water; but the
force of water, if it begins to be violent, cannot by any power of man
be resisted. But these our tribulations which are "waters," are "many
waters." Our common proverb is, "Seldom comes sorrow alone'" but as
waters come rolling and waving many together, so the miseries of this
life. - Thomas Playfere.

[Psa 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#006.md)

"Floods of great waters." - Unfamiliar with the sudden flooding of
thirsty water-courses, we seldom comprehend the full force of some of
the most striking images in the Old and New Testaments. - W. J.
Conybeare, and J. S. Hawson, in "Life and Epistles of St. Paul."

[Psa 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#006.md)

"In the floods," etc. - Washed he may be, as Paul was in the shipwreck,
but not drowned with those floods of great waters: be they never so
great they are bounded. - Joseph Trapp.

[Psa 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#006.md)

"Him." This word must in no case be omitted; it helpeth us to answer a
very strong objection. For it may be said, Many holy men have lost their
goods, have suffered great torments in their body, have been troubled
also in mind; how then did not the "floods of many waters" come near
them? The word "him" helps us to answer. The very philosophers
themselves reckoned their goods pertained no more to them, than, be it
spoken with reverence and regard, the parings of their nails. Zenon
hearing news he had lost all he had by sea, said only thus, Thou hast
done very well, Fortune, to leave me nothing but my cloak. Another,
called Anaxarchus, when as Nicocreon the tyrant commanded he should be
beaten to death in a mortar, spoke thus to the executioner, Beat and
bray as long as thou wilt Anaxarchus his bag or satchel (so he called
his own body), but Anaxarchus thou canst not touch. Yet these, making so
small reckoning of their goods and body, set their mind notwithstanding
at a high rate. The mind of a man is himself, say they. Hence it is that
Julius Caesar, when Amyclas the pilot was greatly afraid of the tempest,
spake to him thus: What meanest thou to fear, base fellow? dost than not
know thou carriest Caesar with thee? As if he should say, Caesar's body
may well be drowned, as any other man's may; but his mind, his
magnanimity, his valour, his fortitude, can never be drowned. Thus far
went philosophy; but divinity goeth a degree further. For philosophy
defineth him, that is, a man, by his reason, and the moral virtues of
the mind; but divinity defineth a Christian man by his faith, and his
conjunction thereby with Christ. Excellently saith Saint Austin: Whence
comes it that the soul dieth? Because faith is not in it whence that the
body dieth? Because a soul is not in it. Therefore the soul of thy soul
is faith. So that if we would know what is a faithful man, we must
define him, not by his natural soul, as he is reasonable, but by the
soul of his soul, which is his faith. And then we easily answer the
objection, that a flood may come near a faithful man's goods, near his
body, near his reasonable soul; but to his faith, that is, to him, it
can never come near. - Thomas Playfere.

[Psa 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#006.md)

Few verses in the Psalms are harder to be understood than this and none
has given rise to more varied expositions among the commentators. "For
this." Some will have it: encouraged by this example, that after so foul
a fall God so readily forgave. Others again: "for this," namely, warned
by this example, they who are holy shall make their prayers that they
may not be permitted to fall as David did. Whichever be the sense, they
well argue from this passage, that the state of absolute and enduring
perfection is impossible to a Christian in this life. - Lorinus, and
Cajetan (1469-1534), quoted by Neale.

[Psa 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#007.md)

"Thou art my hiding place." David does not say, "Thou art a
hiding-place" merely as one among many; or the hiding-place, as the only
one; but, "Thou art my hiding-place." There lies all the excellency of
the text. "He is mine; I have embraced the offer of his salvation," says
David; "I have applied to him in my own person: I have, as a sinner,
taken shelter in his love and compassion; I have placed myself under his
wings; I have covered myself with the robe of his righteousness; and
now, therefore, I am safe." "Blessed is the man whose transgression is
forgiven, whose sin is covered." This is having a part and a lot in the
matter, having the personal and individual benefit of the Saviour's work
of atonement. How different is an appropriating from a speculative
faith! Men tell us that they believe the doctrine, that they acknowledge
the truth, that they assent to our creed; and they say, that to declare
to them the character of Christ, as the sinner's only help and safety,
is merely putting before them what they already know. Now, follow up the
idea suggested by the figure in our text, and see the folly and danger
of acting thus. Suppose a traveller upon a bleak and exposed heath to be
alarmed by the approach of a storm. He looks out for shelter. But if his
eye discern a place to hide from the storm, does he stand still and say,
"I see there is a shelter, and therefore I may remain where I am"? Does
he not betake himself to it? Does he not run, in order to escape the
stormy wind and tempest? It was a "hiding-place" before; but it was his
hiding-place only when he ran into it, and was safe. Had he not gone
into it, though it might have been a protection to a thousand other
travellers who resorted there, to him it would have been as if no such
place existed. Who does not see at once, from this simple illustration,
that the blessings of the gospel are such only in their being
appropriated to the soul? The physician can cure only by being applied
to; the medicine can heal them by being taken; money can enrich only by
being possessed; and the merchantman in the parable would have been none
the wealthier for discovering that there was a "pearl of great price,"
had he not made it his. So with the salvation of the gospel: if Christ
is the "Balm in Gilead," apply the remedy; if he is the "Physician
there," go to him; it he, is the "pearl of great price," sell all that
you have and buy it; and it he is the hiding-place," run into it and be
safe; there will be no solid joy and peace in the mind until he is your
"hiding-place." - Fountain Elwin, 1842.

[Psa 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#007.md)

"Thou art my hiding-place." - An allusion, probably, to the city of
refuge. - Adam Clarke.

[Psa 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#007.md)

"Hiding place." Kirke White has a beautiful hymn upon this word,
beginning, "Awake, sweet harp of Judah, wake." We have no room to quote
it, but it will be found in "Our Own Hymn Book," No. 831.

[Psa 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#007.md)

"Thou shalt preserve me from trouble." If we content ourselves with that
word which our translators have chosen here, "trouble," we must rest in
one of these two senses; either that God shall arm, and indue those that
are his with such a constancy, as those things that trouble others shall
not trouble them; but, "As the sufferings of Christ abound in them, so
their consolation also aboundeth by Christ'" "As unknown, and yet well
known; as dying, and behold we live; as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing;
as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all
things" ([Co2 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#005.md); [Co2
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#009).md); for God uses both these ways in
the behalf of his servants - sometimes to suspend the working of that
that should work their torment, as he suspended the rage of the lions
for Daniel, and the heat of the fire in the furnace for the others;
sometimes by imprinting a holy stupefaction and insensibleness in the
person that suffers; so St. Laurence was not only patient, but merry and
facetious when he lay broiling upon the fire, and so we read of many
other martyrs that have been less moved, less affected with their
torments than their executioners or their persecutors have been. That
which troubled others never troubled them; or else the phrase must have
this sense, that though they be troubled with their troubles, though God
submit them solar to the common condition of men, that they be sensible
of them, yet he shall preserve them from that trouble so as that it
shall never overthrow them, never sink them into a dejection of spirit,
or diffidence in his mercy! they shall find storms, but a stout and
strong ship under foot; they shall feel thunder and lightning, but
garlands of triumphant bays shall preserve them; they shall be trodden
into earth with scorns and contempts, but yet as seed is buried, to
multiply to more. So far this word of our translators assists our
devotion, "Thou shalt preserve me from trouble," thou shalt make me
insensible of it, or thou shalt make me victorious in it. - John Donne.

[Psa 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#007.md)

"Thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance." In these words
the prophet David riseth up by a gradation, and goeth beyond that which
he had formerly said concerning his confidence in God. First, he had
said that God was his hiding-place; secondly, that he would preserve him
in trouble; and now, thirdly, that the Lord would make him joyful, and
to triumph over his troubles and enemies, by compassing him, instead of
troubles, with mercies..... Learn to acknowledge God's goodness to
thyself with particular application, as David saith here, "Thou shalt
compass me about with songs of deliverance." Not only confess his
goodness to others, as to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob; nor only his
deliverance of Noah, Daniel, Lot; but also his mercies to and
deliverance of thyself, as Paul did; "Christ gave himself for me, and
died for me." [Gal 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020.md). This will
exceedingly whet up thankfulness; whereas only to acknowledge God good
in himself, or to others, and not to thyself, will make thee murmur and
repine. - Thomas Taylor.

[Psa 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#007.md)

"Thou shalt compass me about." This word importeth that as we are
besieged on every side with troubles, so we are compassed with as many
comforts and deliverances; as our crosses grow daily, so our
consolations are augmented day by day. We are on every side offended and
on every side defended; therefore we ought on every side to sound God's
praise, as David saith, "Bless the Lord, O my soul; and all that is
within me." [Psa 103:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#001.md). - Archibald
Symson.

[Psa 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#007.md)

"Songs of deliverance." In that he will not be content only with thanks,
but also will have them conjoined with "songs," he letteth us see how
high all the strings of his heart are bended that he cannot contain
himself for the mercies of God to his church, and for his manifold
deliverances for the same. Many sing praises to God with an half-open
mouth; and, albeit, they can sing aloud any filthy ballad in their
house, they make the mean, I warrant you, in the church, that scarce can
they hear the sound of their own voice. I think they be ashamed to
proclaim and show forth God's praises, or they fear to deafen God by
their loud singing; but David bended all his forces within and without
to praise his God. - Archibald Symson.

[Psa 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#008.md)

"I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go." No
other than God himself can undertake so much as is promised in the text.
For here is faith, a rectifying of the understanding, "I will instruct
thee," and in the original there is somewhat more than our translation
reaches to; it is there, Intelligere faciam te, I will make thee
understand. Man can instruct, God only can make us understand. And then
it is Faciam te, I will make thee, thee, understand; the work is the
Lord's, the understanding is the man's' for God does not work in man as
the devil did in idols and in pythonissis, and in ventriloquis, in
possessed persons, who had no voluntary concurrence with the action of
the devil, but were merely passive; God works so in man as that he makes
man work too, faciam te, I will make thee understand; that that shall be
done shall be done by me, but in thee; the Dower that rectifies the act
is God's the act is man's; Faciam te, says God, I will make thee, thee,
every particular person (for that arises out of this singular and
distributive word, thee, which threatens no exception, no exclusion), I
will make every person to whom I present instruction, capable of that
instruction; and if he receive it not, it is only his, and not my fault.
And so this first part is an instruction de credendis, of such things,
as by God's rectifying of our understanding we are bound to believe. And
then, in a second part, there follows a more particular instructing,
Docebo, "I will teach thee," and that in via, "in the way;" it is not
only de via, to teach thee which is the way, that thou mayst find it,
but in via, how to keep the way when thou art in it; he will teach thee,
not only ut gradiaris, that thou mayst walk in it and not sleep, but
quomodo gradieris, that thou mayst walk in it and not stray; and so this
second part is an institution de agendis, of those things which thine
understanding being formerly rectified, and deduced into a belief, thou
art bound to do. And then in the last words of the text, "I will guide
thee with mine eye," there is a third part, an establishment, a
confirmation, by an incessant watchfulness in God; he will consider,
consult upon us (for so much the original word imports) he will not
leave us to contingencies, to fortune; no, nor to his own general
providence, by which all creatures are universally in his protection and
administration, but he will ponder us, consider us, study us; and that
with his eye, which is the sharpest and most sensible organ and
instrument, soonest feels if anything be amiss, and so inclines him
quickly to rectify us; and so this third part is an instruction de
sperandis, it hath evermore a relation to the future to the constancy
and perseverance of God's goodness towards us; to the end, and in the
end he will guide us with his eye: except the eye of God can be put out
we cannot be put out of his sight and his care so that both our freight
which we are to take in, that is, what we are to believe concerning God;
and the voyage which we are to make, how we are to steer and govern our
course, that is, our behaviour and conversation in the household of the
faithful; and then the haven to which we must go, that is, our assurance
of arriving at the heavenly Jerusalem, are expressed in this chart, in
this map, in this instruction, in this text. - John Donne.

[Psa 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#008.md)

This threefold repetition, "I will instruct thee," "I will teach thee,"
"I will guide thee," teaches us three properties of a good teacher,
First, to make the people understand the way of salvation; secondly, to
go before them; thirdly, to watch over them and their ways. - Archibald
Symson.

[Psa 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#008.md)

"The way." If we compare this way with all other ways, it will whet our
care to enter into and continue in it; for, first, this is the King's
highway, in which we have promise of protection. [Psa
91:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011.md). Secondly, God's ways are the
cleanest of all. [Sa2 22:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#031.md).
Thirdly,-od's ways are the rightest ways; and, being rightest, they be
also the shortest ways. [Hos 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#009.md).
Fourthly, God's ways are most lightsome and cheerful. [Pro
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#017.md). Therefore, God's ways being the
safest, cleanest, rightest, shortest, and lightsomest ways, we must be
careful to walk in them. - Condensed from Thomas Taylor.

[Psa 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#008.md)

"I will guide thee with mine eye." We read in natural story of some
creatures, Qui solo oculorum aspectu fovent ova, which hatch their eggs
only by looking upon them. What cannot the eye of God produce and hatch
in us? Plus est quod probatur aspectu, quam quod sermone. A man may seem
to commend in words, and yet his countenance shall dispraise. His word
infuses good purposes into us; but if God continue his eye upon us it is
a further approbation, for he is a God of pure eyes, and will not look
upon the wicked. "This land doth the Lord thy God care for, and the eyes
of the Lord are always upon it from the beginning of the year, even to
the end thereof." [Deu 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#012.md). What a
cheerful spring, what a fruitful autumn hath that soul, that hath the
eye of the Lord always upon her! The eye of the Lord upon me makes
midnight noon; it makes Capricorn Cancer, and the winter's the summer's
solstice; the eye of the Lord sanctifies, nay, more than sanctifies,
glorifies all the eclipses of dishonour, makes melancholy cheerfulness,
diffidence assurance, and turns the jealousy of the sad soul into
infallability.... This guiding us with his eye manifests itself in these
two great effects; conversion to him, and union with him. First, his eye
works upon ours; his eye turns ours to look upon him. Still it is so
expressed with an Ecce; "Behold the eye of the Lord is upon all them
that fear him;" his eye calls ours to behold that; and then our eye
calls upon his, to observe our cheerful readiness.... When, as a well
made picture doth always look upon him that looks upon it, this image of
God in our soul is turned to him, by his turning to it, it is impossible
we should do any foul, any uncomely thing in his presence.... The other
great effect of his guiding us with his eye, is, that it unites us to
himself; when he fixes his eye upon us, and accepts the return of ours
to him, then he "keeps" us as the "apple" of his "eye," [Zac
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#008.md).... These are the two great
effects of his guiding us by his eye, that first, his eye turns us to
himself, and then turns us into himself; first, his eye turns ours to
him, and then, that makes us all one with himself, so as that our
afflictions shall be put upon his patience, and our dishonours shall be
injurious to him; we cannot be safer than by being his; but thus we are
not only his, but he - to every persecutor, in every one of our behalf,
he shall say, Cur me? Why persecutest thou me? And as he is all power,
and can defend us, so here he makes himself all eye, which is the most
tender part, and most sensible of our pressures. - Condensed from John
Donne.

[Psa 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#008.md)

"I will guide thee with mine eye." Marg., I will counsel thee, mine eye
shall be upon thee, The margin expresses the sense of the Hebrew. The
literal meaning is, "I will counsel thee; mine eye shall be upon thee."
De Wette: "my eye shall be directed towards thee." The idea is that of
one who is telling another what way he is to take in order that he may
reach a certain place; and he says he will watch him, or will keep an
eye upon him; he will not let him go wrong. - Albert Barnes.

[Psa 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#008.md)

"Mine eye." We may consider mercies as the beamings of the Almighty's
eye when the light of his countenance is lifted up upon us; and that man
as guided by the eye, whom mercies attract and attach to his Maker. But
oh! let us refuse to be guided by the eye, and it will become needful
that we be curbed with the hand. If we abuse our mercies, if we forget
their Author, and yield him not gratefully the homage of our affections,
we do but oblige him, by his love for our souls, to apportion us
disaster and trouble. Complain not, then, that there is so much of
sorrow in your lot; but consider rather how much of it you may have
wilfully brought upon yourselves. Listen to the voice of God. "I will
instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will
guide thee with mine eye" - mine eye, whose glance gilds all that is
beautiful, whose light disperses all darkness prevents all danger,
diffuses all happiness. And why, then, is it that ye are sorely
disquieted? why is it that "fear and the pit" are so often upon you;
that one blessing after another disappears from your circle; and that
God seems to deal with you as with the wayward and unruly, on whom any
thing of gentleness would be altogether lost? Ah! if you would account
for many mercies that have departed, if you would insure permanence to
those that are yet left, examine how deficient you may hitherto have
been, and strive to be more diligent for the future, in obeying an
admonition which implies that we should be guided by the soft lustres of
the eye, if our obduracy did not render indispensible the harsh
constraints of the rein. - Henry Melvill.

[Psa 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#009.md)

"Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule," etc. How many run mad of this
cause, inordinate and furious lusts! The prophet Jeremiah, [Jer
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#024.md), compareth Israel to "a swift
dromedary, traversing her ways," and to a "wild ass used to the
wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure." "Be ye not,"
saith the Psalmographer, "as the horse, or as the mule, which have no
understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle." Men
have understanding, not beasts; yet when the frenzy of lust overwhelmeth
their senses, we may take up the word of the prophet and pour it on
them: "Every man is a beast by his own knowledge." And therefore "man
that is in honour and understandeth not, is like unto beasts that
perish" ([Psa 49:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#020).md). Did not the
bridle of God's overruling providence restrain their madness, they would
cast off the saddle of reason, and kick nature itself in the face. -
Thomas Adams.

[Psa 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#009.md)

"Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule," etc. According to the several
natures of these two beasts, the fathers and other expositors have made
several interpretations; at least, several allusions. They consider the
horse and the mule to admit any rider, any burden, without discretion or
difference, without debatement or consideration; they never ask whether
their rider be noble or base, nor whether their load be sold for the
treasure or roots for the market. And those expositors find the same
indifference in an habitual sinner to any kind of sin; whether he sin
for pleasure, or sin for profit, or sin but for company, still he sins.
They consider in the mule, that one of his parents being more ignoble
than the other, he is likest the worst, he hath more of the ass than of
the horse in him; and they find in us, that all our actions and thoughts
taste more of the ignobler part of earth than of heaven. St. Hierome
thinks fierceness and rashness to be presented in the horse, and sloth
in the mule. And St. Augustine carries these two qualities far; he
thinks that in this fierceness of the horse the Gentiles are
represented, which ran far from the knowledge of Christianity; and by
the laziness of the mule the Jews, who came nothing so fast, as they
were invited by their former helps to the embracing thereof. They have
gone far in these allusions and applications; and they might have gone
as far further as it had pleased them; they have sea-room enough, that
will compare a beast and a sinner together; and they shall find many
times, in the way, the beast the better man. - John Donne.

[Psa 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#009.md)

"Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule," etc. Consider the causes why a
broken leg is incurable in a horse, and easily curable in a man. The
horse is incapable of counsel to submit himself to the farrier; and
therefore in case his leg be set he flings, flounces, and flies out,
unjointing it again by his misemployed mettle, counting all binding to
be shackles and fetters unto him: whereas a man willingly resigns
himself to be ordered by the surgeon, preferring rather to be a prisoner
for some days, than a cripple all his life. "Be ye not as the horse, or
as the mule, which have no understanding;" but "let patience have its
perfect work in thee." [Jam 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#004.md). -
Thomas Fuller.

[Psa 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#009.md)

"Bit and bridle." מהג-ודסן. The lxx render the first of these two words
by χαλινῷ, the second by κημῷ. The word χαλινός signifies the iron of
the common bridle, which is put into the horse's mouth, the bit, or
curb. But κημός was something like a muzzle, which was put upon
mischievous horses or mules to hinder them from biting. Xenophon says,
that it allowed them to breathe, but kept the mouth shut, so that they
could not bite. Not knowing the term of art for this contrivance, I call
it a muzzle. The verb קדב is a military term, and signifies to advance,
as an enemy, to attack. The "coming near," therefore, intended here, is
a coming near to do mischief. The admonition given by the Psalmist to
his companions, is to submit to the instruction and guidance graciously
promised from heaven, and not to resemble, in a refractory disposition,
those ill-conditioned colts which are not to be governed by a simple
bridle; but, unless their jaws are confined by a muzzle, will attack the
rider as he attempts to mount, or the groom as he leads them to the
pasture and the stable. - Samuel Horsley.

[Psa 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#009.md)

"Lest they come near unto thee." The common version of this clause would
be suitable enough in speaking of a wild beast, but in reference to a
mule or a horse the words can only mean, because they will not follow or
obey thee of their own accord; they must be constantly coerced, in the
way both of compulsion and restraint. - J. A. Alexander.

[Psa 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#009.md)

"Be ye not like a horse or mule, which have no understanding, and whose
ornament is a bridle and bit, to hold them; they do not come unto thee
of themselves." - Charles Carter, in "The Book of Psalms." 1869. \[A new
Translation.\]

[Psa 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#010.md)

"He that trusteth in the Lord, mercy shall compass him about." Even as
in the midst of the sphere is the centre, from which all lines being
drawn do tend towards their circumference: so a good Christian man hath
God for his circumference; for whatever he thinketh, speaketh, or doth,
it tendeth to Christ, of whom he is compassed round about. - Robert
Cawdray.

[Psa 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#010.md)

"Mercy shall compass him about." He shall be surrounded with mercy - as
one is surrounded by the air, or by the sunlight. He shall find mercy
and favour everywhere - at home, abroad; by day, by night; in society,
in solitude; in sickness, in health; in life, in death; in time, in
eternity. He shall walk amidst mercies; he shall die amidst mercies; he
shall live in a better world in the midst of eternal mercies. - Albert
Barnes.

[Psa 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#010.md)

"Mark that text," said Richard Adkins to his grandson Abel, who was
reading to him the [Psa 32:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md). "Mark
that text, 'He that trusteth in the Lord, mercy shall compass him
about.' I read it in my youth and believed it; and now I read it in my
old age, thank God, I know it to be true. Oh! it is a blessed thing in
the midst of the joys and sorrows of the world, Abel, to trust in the
Lord." - The Christian Treasury, 1848.

[Psa 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#011.md)

"Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all
ye that are upright in heart." This exhortation containeth three parts.
First, what he doth exhort unto, to rejoice. Secondly, whom, the
righteous, and upright men. Thirdly, the limitation, "in the Lord." He
exhorteth them three times - be glad, rejoice, and be joyful; and as he
made mention of a threefold blessing, so doth he of a threefold joy.
Wherein we have two things necessary to be observed. First, the dulness
of our natures, who as slow horses need many spurs and provocations to
spiritual things, whereas we are naturally overmuch bent to carnal
things, that we need no incitations thereunto. But by the contrary in
spiritual things, we are cast into a deep sleep, who cannot be awakened
at the first cry; but as men after drink have need to be roused often,
that they may behold the light; so men drunken with the pleasures of
sin, as Nazianzen saith, must be wakened by divers exhortations; as this
same prophet in the subsequent Psalm redoubleth his exhortations for the
same effect. And the apostle to Philippians saith: "Rejoice in the Lord
alway: and again I say, Rejoice" ([Phi
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#004).md). Next, perceive that this
exhortation grows; for the word be glad, properly in the original
signifieth an inward and hearty joy, by the presence or hope at least of
a thing desirable or good. The word rejoice, to express our joy by some
outward gesture, sometimes used for dancing, as, "The hills skip for
gladness." [Psa 65:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#012.md). The word be
joyful, to cry for gladness, as the dumb man's tongue shall sing. This
gradation teacheth us, that this is the nature of spiritual joy - that
it still increaseth in us by certain degrees, until it come to the
perfection of all joy, which is signified by the last word, importing,
as it were, a triumph and shouting after victory. So that they are truly
penitent who have overcome sin and Satan in their spiritual combat, and
have triumphed over them as vanquished enemies. - Archibald Symson.

[Psa 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#011.md)

"Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye righteous." There is never a
joyful man alive but a believer. Will you say that men take pleasure in
their sins? Why, that is the Devil's joy; or that they rejoice in full
barns and bags? That is the fool's joy; or that they rejoice in wine,
that is, all dainties that gratify the palate? That is a Bedlam joy.
Read and believe [Ecc 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#003.md); indeed,
from the [Ecc 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#001.md)to the [Ecc
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#011.md), the whole book, but especially
that chapter, is the divinest philosophy that ever was or will be. -
Christopher Fowler (1610-1678), in "Morning Exercises."

[Psa 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#011.md)

"Shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart." When the poet Carpani
enquired of his friend Haydn, how it happened that his church music was
so cheerful, the great composer made a most beautiful reply. "I cannot,"
he said, "make it otherwise. I write according to the thoughts I feel:
when I think upon God, my heart is so full of joy that the notes dance
and leap, as it were, from my pen: and, since God has given me a
cheerful heart, it will be pardoned me that I serve him with a cheerful
spirit. - John Whitecross's Anecdotes.

[Psa 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#011.md)

Here the sensual man, that haply would catch hold when it is said,
"Rejoice," by-and-by, when it is added, "in the Lord," will let his hold
go. But they that, by reason of the billows and waves of the troublesome
sea of this world, cannot brook the speech when it is said, "Rejoice,"
are to lay sure hold fast upon it when it is added, "Rejoice in the
Lord." - Henry Airay.

[Psa 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#011.md).

O sing unto this glittering, glorious King;

O praise his name, let every living thing;

Let heart and voice, like bells of silver ring

The comfort that this day doth bring.

Kinwellmersh, quoted by A. Moody Stuart.

[Psa 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#011.md)

It is storied by the famous Tully concerning Syracuse, that there is no
day throughout the whole year so stormy and tempestuous in which the
inhabitants have not some glimpse and sight of the sun. The like
observation may be truly made on all those Psalms of David in which his
complaints are most multiplied, his fears and pressures most insisted
on; that there is not any of them so totally overcast with the black
darkness of despair, but that we may easily discern them to be here and
there intervened and streaked with some comfortable expressions of his
faith and hope in God. If in the beginning of a Psalm we find him
restless in his motions, like Noah's dove upon the overspreading waters;
yet in the close we shall see him like the same dove returning with an
olive branch in its mouth, and fixing upon the ark. If we find him in
another Psalm staggering in the midst of his distresses, through the
prevalency of carnal fears, we may also in it behold him recovering
himself again, by fetching arguments from faith, whose topics are of a
higher elevation than to be shaken by the timorous suggestions that
arise from the flesh. If at another time we behold him like to a boat on
drift, that is, tossed and beaten by the inconstant winds and fierce
waves; yet we shall still find all his rollings and agitations to be
such as carry him towards the standing shore, where he rides at last
both in peace and safety. - William Spurstowe.

[Psalms 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 32:1</span></span>

1 Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.

2 Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity and in
whose spirit there is no guile.

[Psa 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md)

"Blessed." Like the sermon on the mount, this Psalm begins with
beatitudes. This is the second Psalm of benediction. The [Psa
1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)describes the result of holy
blessedness, the [Psa 32:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md)details
the cause of it. The first pictures the tree in full growth, this
depicts it in its first planting and watering. He who in the[Psa
1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md) is a reader of God's book, is
here a suppliant at God's throne accepted and heard. "Blessed is he
whose transgression is forgiven." He is now blessed, and ever shall be.
Be he ever so poor, or sick, or sorrowful, he is blessed in very deed.
Pardoning mercy is of all things in the world most to be prized, for it
is the only and sure way to happiness. To hear from God's own Spirit the
words, "absolvo te" is joy unspeakable. Blessedness is not in this case
ascribed to the man who has been a diligent lawkeeper, for then it would
never come to us, but rather to a lawbreaker, who by grace most rich and
free has been forgiven. Self-righteous Pharisees have no portion in this
blessedness. Over the returning prodigal, the word of welcome is here
pronounced, and the music and dancing begin. A full, instantaneous,
irreversible pardon of transgression turns the poor sinner's hell into
heaven, and makes the heir of wrath a partaker in blessing. The word
rendered forgiven is in the original taken off, or taken away, as a
burden is lifted or a barrier removed. What a lift is here! It cost our
Saviour a sweat of blood to bear our load, yea, it cost him his life to
bear it quite away. Samson carried the gates of Gaza, but what was that
to the weight which Jesus bore on our behalf? "Whose sin is covered."
Covered by God, as the ark was covered by the mercy-seat, as Noah was
covered from the flood, as the Egyptians were covered by the depths of
the sea. What a cover must that be which hides away for ever from the
sight of the all-seeing God all the filthiness of the flesh and of the
spirit! He who has once seen sin in its horrible deformity, will
appreciate the happiness of seeing it no more for ever. Christ's
atonement is the propitiation, the covering, the making an end of sin;
where this is seen and trusted in, the soul knows itself to be now
accepted in the Beloved, and therefore enjoys a conscious blessedness
which is the antepast of heaven. It is clear from the text that a man
may know that he is pardoned: where would be the blessedness of an
unknown forgiveness? Clearly it is a matter of knowledge, for it is the
ground of comfort.

[Psa 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#002.md)

"Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity." The word
blessed is in the plural, oh, the blessednesses! the double joys, the
bundles of happiness, the mountains of delight! Note the three words so
often used to denote our disobedience: transgression, sin, and iniquity,
are the three-headed dog at the gates of hell, but our glorious Lord has
silenced its barkings for ever against his own believing ones. The
trinity of sin is overcome by the Trinity of heaven. Non-imputation is
of the very essence of pardon: the believer sins, but his sin is not
reckoned, not accounted to him. Certain divines froth at the mouth with
rage against imputed righteousness, be it ours to see our sin not
imputed, and to us may there be as Paul words it, "Righteousness imputed
without works." He is blessed indeed who has a substitute to stand for
him to whose account all his debts may be set down. "And in whose spirit
there is no guile." He who is pardoned, has in every case been taught to
deal honestly with himself, his sin, and his God. Forgiveness is no
sham, and the peace which it brings is not caused by playing tricks with
conscience. Self-deception and hypocrisy bring no blessedness, they may
drug the soul into hell with pleasant dreams, but into the heaven of
true peace they cannot conduct their victim. Free from guilt, free from
guile. Those who are justified from fault are sanctified from falsehood.
A liar is not a forgiven soul. Treachery, double-dealing, chicanery,
dissimulation, are lineaments of the devil's children, but he who is
washed from sin is truthful, honest, simple, and childlike. There can be
no blessedness to tricksters with their plans, and tricks, and
shuffling, and pretending: they are too much afraid of discovery to be
at ease; their house is built on the volcano's brink, and eternal
destruction must be their portion. Observe the three words to describe
sin, and the three words to represent pardon, weigh them well, and note
their meanings. (See note at the end.)

[Psalms 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 32:3</span></span>

3 When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day
long.

4 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned
into the drought of summer. Selah.

5 I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I
said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and thou forgavest
the iniquity of my sin. Selah.

David now gives us his own experience; no instructor is so efficient as
one who testifies to what he has personally known and felt. He writes
well who like the spider spills his matter out of his own bowels.

[Psa 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#003.md)

"When I kept silence." When through neglect I failed to confess, or
through despair dared not to do so, "my bones," those solid pillars of
my frame, the strongest portions of my bodily constitution, "waxed old,"
began to decay with weakness, for my grief was so intense as to sap my
health and destroy my vital energy. What a killing thing is sin! It is a
pestilent disease! A fire in the bones! While we smother our sin it
rages within, and like a gathering wound swells horribly and torments
terribly. "Through my roaring all the day long." He was silent as to
confession, but not as to sorrow. Horror at his great guilt, drove David
to incessant laments, until his voice was no longer like the articulate
speech of man, but so full of sighing and groaning, that it resembled
the hoarse roaring of a wounded beast. None know the pangs of conviction
but those who have endured them. The rack, the wheel, the flaming fagot
are ease compared with the Tophet which a guilty conscience kindles
within the breast: better suffer all the diseases which flesh is heir
to, than lie under the crushing sense of the wrath of almighty God. The
Spanish inquisition with all its tortures was nothing to the inquest
which conscience holds within the heart.

[Psa 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#004.md)

"For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me." God's finger can crush
us - what must his hand be, and that pressing heavily and continuously!
Under terrors of conscience, men have little rest by night, for the grim
thoughts of the day dog them to their chambers and haunt their dreams,
or else they lie awake in a cold sweat of dread. God's hand is very
helpful when it uplifts, but it is awful when it presses down: better a
world on the shoulder, like Atlas, than God's hand on the heart, like
David. "My moisture is turned into the drought of summer." The sap of
his soul was dried, and the body through sympathy appeared to be bereft
of its needful fluids. The oil was almost gone from the lamp of life,
and the flame flickered as though it would soon expire. Unconfessed
transgression, like a fierce poison, dried up the fountain of the man's
strength, and made him like a tree blasted by the lightning, or a plant
withered by the scorching heat of a tropical sun. Alas! for a poor soul
when it has learned its sin but forgets its Saviour, it goes hard with
it indeed. "Selah." It was time to change the tune, for the notes are
very low in the scale, and with such hard usage, the strings of the harp
are out of order: the next verse will surely be set to another key, or
will rehearse a more joyful subject.

[Psa 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#005.md)

"I acknowledged my sin unto thee." After long lingering, the broken
heart bethought itself of what it ought to have done at the first, and
laid bare its bosom before the Lord. The lancet must be let into the
gathering ulcer before relief can be afforded. The least thing we can
do, if we would be pardoned, is to acknowledge our fault; if we are too
proud for this we doubly deserve punishment. "And mine iniquity have I
not hid." We must confess the guilt as well as the fact of sin. It is
useless to conceal it, for it is well known to God; it is beneficial to
us to own it, for a full confession softens and humbles the heart. We
must as far as possible unveil the secrets of the soul, dig up the
hidden treasure of Achan, and by weight and measure bring out our sins.
"I said." This was his fixed resolution. "I will confess my
transgressions unto the Lord." Not to my fellow men or to the high
priest, but unto Jehovah; even in those days of symbol the faithful
looked to God alone for deliverance from sin's intolerable load, much
more now, when types and shadows have vanished at the appearance of the
dawn. When the soul determines to lay low and plead guilty, absolution
is near at hand; hence we read, "And thou forgavest the iniquity of my
sin." Not only was the sin itself pardoned, but the iniquity of it; the
virus of its guilt was put away, and that at once, so soon as the
acknowledgment was made. God's pardons are deep and thorough' the knife
of mercy cuts at the roots of the ill weed of sin. "Selah." Another
pause is needed, for the matter is not such as may be hurried over:

"Pause, my soul, adore and wonder,

Ask, O why such love to me?

Grace has put me in the number

Of the Saviour's family.

Hallelujah!

Thanks, eternal thanks, to thee."

[Psalms 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 32:6</span></span>

6 For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when
thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall
not come nigh unto him.

7 Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou
shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.

[Psa 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#006.md)

"For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when
thou mayest be found." If the Psalmist means that on account of God's
mercy others would become hopeful, his witness is true. Remarkable
answers to prayer very much quicken the prayerfulness of other godly
persons. Where one man finds a golden nugget others feel inclined to
dig. The benefit of our experience to others should reconcile us to it.
No doubt the case of David has led thousands to seek the Lord with
hopeful courage who, without such an instance to cheer them, might have
died in despair. Perhaps the Psalmist meant for this favour or the like
all godly souls would seek, and here, again, we can confirm his
testimony, for all will draw near to God in the same manner as he did
when godliness rules their heart. The mercy seat is the way to heaven
for all who shall ever come there. There is, however, a set time for
prayer, beyond which it will be unavailing; between the time of sin and
the day of punishment mercy rules the hour, and God may be found, but
when once the sentence has gone forth pleading will be useless, for the
Lord will not be found by the condemned soul. O dear reader, slight not
the accepted time waste not the day of salvation. The godly pray while
the Lord has promised to answer the ungodly postpone their petitions
till the Master of the house has risen up and shut to the door, and then
their knocking is too late. What a blessing to be led to seek the Lord
before the great devouring floods leap forth from their lairs, for then
when they do appear we shall be safe. "Surely in the floods of great
waters they shall not come nigh unto him." The floods shall come, and
the waves shall rage, and toss themselves like Atlantic billows;
whirlpools and waterspouts shall be on every hand, but the praying man
shall be at a safe distance, most surely secured from every ill. David
was probably most familiar with those great land-floods which fill up,
with rushing torrents, the beds of rivers which at other times are
almost dry: these overflowing waters often did great damage, and, as in
the case of the Kishon, were sufficient to sweep away whole armies. From
sudden and overwhelming disasters thus set forth in metaphor the true
suppliant will certainly be held secure. He who is saved from sin has no
need to fear anything else.

[Psa 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#007.md)

"Thou art my hiding place." Terse, short sentences make up this verse,
but they contain a world of meaning. Personal claims upon our God are
the joy of spiritual life. To lay our hand upon the Lord with the clasp
of a personal "my" is delight at its full. Observe that the same man who
in the fourth verse was oppressed by the presence of God, here finds a
shelter in him. See what honest confession and full forgiveness will do!
The gospel of substitution makes him to be our refuge who otherwise
would have been our judge. "Thou shalt preserve me from trouble."
Trouble shall do me no real harm when the Lord is with me, rather it
shall bring me much benefit, like the file which clears away the rust,
but does not destroy the metal. Observe the three tenses, we have
noticed the sorrowful past, the last sentence was a joyful present, this
is a cheerful future. "Thou shalt compass me about with songs of
deliverance." What a golden sentence! The man is encircled in song,
surrounded by dancing mercies, all of them proclaiming the triumphs of
grace. There is no breach in the circle, it completely rings him round;
on all sides he hears music. Before him hope sounds the cymbals, and
behind him gratitude beats the timbrel. Right and left, above and
beneath, the air resounds with joy, and all this for the very man who, a
few weeks ago, was roaring all the day long. How great a change! What
wonders grace has done and still can do! "Selah." There was need of a
pause, for love so amazing needs to be pondered, and joy so great
demands quiet contemplation, since language fails to express it.

[Psalms 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 32:8</span></span>

8 I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go; I
will guide thee with mine eye.

9 Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding
whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near
unto thee.

[Psa 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#008.md)

"I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go."
Here the Lord is the speaker, and gives the Psalmist an answer to his
prayer. Our Saviour is our instructor. The Lord himself deigns to teach
his children to walk in the way of integrity, his holy word and the
monitions of the Holy Spirit are the directors of the believer's daily
conversation. We are not pardoned that we may henceforth live after our
own lusts, but that we may be educated in holiness and trained for
perfection. A heavenly training is one of the covenant blessings which
adoption seals to us: "All thy children shall be taught by the Lord."
Practical teaching is the very best of instruction, and they are thrice
happy who, although they never sat at the feet of Gamaliel, and are
ignorant of Aristotle, and the ethics of the schools, have nevertheless
learned to follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. "I will guide thee
with mine eye." As servants take their cue from the master's eye, and a
nod or a wink is all that they require, so should we obey the slightest
hints of our Master, not needing thunderbolts to startle our
incorrigible sluggishness, but being controlled by whispers and
love-touches. The Lord is the great overseer, whose eye in providence
overlooks everything. It is well for us to be the sheep of his pasture,
following the guidance of his wisdom.

[Psa 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#009.md)

"Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding."
Understanding separates man from a brute - let us not act as if we were
devoid of it. Men should take counsel and advice, and be ready to run
where wisdom points them the way. Alas! we need to be cautioned against
stupidity of heart, for we are very apt to fall into it. We who ought to
be as the angels, readily become as the beasts. "Whose mouth must be
held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee." It is much
to be deplored that we so often,iced to be severely chastened before we
will obey. We ought to be as a feather in the wind, wafted readily in
the breath of the Holy Spirit, but alas! we lie like motionless logs,
and stir not with heaven itself in view. Those cutting bits of
affliction show how hard-mouthed we are, those bridles of infirmity
manifest our headstrong and wilful manners. We should not be treated
like mules if there were not so much of the ass about us. If we will be
fractious, we must expect to be kept in with tight rein. Oh for grace to
obey the Lord willingly, lest like the wilful servant, we are beaten
with many stripes. Calvin renders the last words, "Lest they kick
against thee," a version more probable and more natural, but the passage
is confessedly obscure - not, however, in its general sense.

[Psalms 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 32:10</span></span>

10 Many sorrows shall be to the wicked; but he that trusteth in the
Lord, mercy shall compass him about.

11 Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy,
all ye that are upright in heart.

[Psa 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#010.md)

"Many sorrows shall be to the wicked." Like refractory horses and mules,
they have many cuts and bruises. Here and hereafter the portion of the
wicked is undesirable. Their joys are evanescent, their sorrows are
multiplying and ripening. He who sows sin will reap sorrow in heavy
sheaves. Sorrows of conscience, of disappointment, of terror, are the
sinner's sure heritage in time, and then for ever sorrows of remorse and
despair. Let those who boast of present sinful joys, remember the shall
be of the future, and take warning. "But he that trusteth in the Lord,
mercy shall compass him about." Faith is here placed as the opposite of
wickedness, since it is the source of virtue. Faith in God is the great
charmer of life's cares, and he who possesses it, dwells in an
atmosphere of grace, surrounded with a body-guard of mercies. May it be
given to us of the Lord at all times to believe in the mercy of God,
even when we cannot see traces of its working, for to the believer,
mercy is as all-surrounding as omniscience, and every thought and act of
God is perfumed with it. The wicked have a hive of wasps around them,
many sorrows; but we have a swarm of bees storing honey for us.

[Psa 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#011.md)

"Be glad." Happiness is not only our privilege, but our duty. Truly we
serve a generous God, since he makes it a part of our obedience to be
joyful. How sinful are our rebellious murmurings! How natural does it
seem that a man blest with forgiveness should be glad! We read of one
who died at the foot of the scaffold of overjoy at the receipt of his
monarch's pardon; and shall we receive the free pardon of the King of
kings and yet pine in inexcusable sorrow? "In the Lord." Here is the
directory by which gladness is preserved from levity. We are not to be
glad in sin, or to find comfort in corn, and wine, and oil, but in our
God is to be the garden of our soul's delight. That there is a God and
such a God, and that he is ours, ours for ever, our Father and our
reconciled Lord, is matter enough for a never-ending Psalm of rapturous
joy. "And rejoice, ye righteous," redouble your rejoicing, peal upon
peal. Since God has clothed his choristers in the white garments of
holiness, let them not restrain their joyful voices, but sing aloud and
shout as those who find great spoil. "And shout for joy, all ye that are
upright in heart." Our happiness should be demonstrative; chill penury
of love often represses the noble flame of joy, and men whisper their
praises decorously where a hearty outburst of song would be far more
natural. It is to be feared that the church of the present day, through
a craving for excessive propriety, is growing too artificial; so that
enquirers' cries and believers' shouts would be silenced if they were
heard in our assemblies. This may be better than boisterous fanaticism,
but there is as much danger in the one direction as the other. For our
part, we are touched to the heart by a little sacred excess, and when
godly men in their joy overleap the narrow bounds of decorum, we do not,
like Michal, Saul's daughter, eye them with a sneering heart. Note how
the pardoned are represented as upright, righteous, and without guile; a
man may have many faults and yet be saved, but a false heart is
everywhere the damning mark. A man of twisting, shifty ways, of a
crooked, crafty nature, is not saved, and in all probability never will
be; for the ground which brings forth a harvest when grace is sown in
it, may be weedy and waste, but our Lord tells us it is honest and good
ground. Our observation has been that men of double tongues and tricky
ways are the least likely of all men to be saved: certainly where grace
comes it restores man's mind to its perpendicular, and delivers him from
being doubled up with vice, twisted with craft, or bent with dishonesty.

Reader, what a delightful Psalm! Have you, in perusing it, been able to
claim a lot in the goodly land? If so, publish to others the way of
salvation.
