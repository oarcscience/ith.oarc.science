### [Psalms Chapter 129](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 129:0</span></span>

Title. - A Song of Degrees. I fail to see how this is a step beyond the
previous Psalm; and yet it is clearly the song of an older and more
tried individual, who looks back upon a life of affliction in which he
suffered all along, even from his youth. Inasmuch as patience is a
higher, or at least more difficult, grace than domestic love, the ascent
or progress may perhaps be seen in that direction. Probably if we knew
more of the stations on the road to the Temple we should see a reason
for the order of these Psalms; but as that information cannot be
obtained, we must take the songs as we find them, and remember that, as
we do not now go on pilgrimages to Zion, it is our curiosity and not our
necessity which is a loser by our not knowing the cause of the
arrangement of the songs in this Pilgrim Psalter.

Author, Etc. - It does not seem to us at all needful to ascribe this
Psalm to a period subsequent to the captivity: indeed, it is more
suitable to a time when as yet the enemy had not so Jar prevailed as to
have carried the people into a distant land. It is a mingled hymn of
sorrow and of strong resolve. Though sorely smitten, the afflicted one
is heart-whole, and scorns to yield in the least degree to the enemy.
The poet sings the trials of Israel, [Psa
129:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001); the interposition of the
Lord, [Psa 129:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#004); and the unblessed
condition of Israel's foes, [Psa
129:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#005). It is a rustic song, full of
allusions to husbandry. It reminds us of the books of Ruth and Amos.

Hints to Preachers

[Psa 129:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001). - Affliction as it comes
to saints from men of the world.

I. Reason for it - enmity of the serpent's seed.

II\. Modes of its display - persecution, ridicule, slander, disdain,
etc.

III\. Comfort under it. So persecuted they the prophets: so the Master.
It is their nature. They cannot kill the soul. It is but for a time,
etc.

[Psa 129:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001) and [Psa
129:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#002). -

I. How far persecution for righteousness' sake may go.

1\. It may be great: "afflicted afflicted."

2\. It may be frequent: "Many a time."

3\. It may be early: "From my youth."

II\. How far it cannot go.

1\. It may seem to prevail.

2\. It may prevail in some degree.

3\. It cannot ultimately prevail.

4\. It shall cause that to which it is opposed increasingly to prevail.
- G. R.

[Psa 129:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001). - Israel persecuted but
not forsaken. Persecution.

I. Whence it came: "they."

II\. How it came: "Many a time," "from my youth," severely: "afflicted,
ploughed."

III\. Wily it came. Human and Satanic hatred, and Divine permission.

IV\. What came of it: "not prevailed" - to destroy, to drive to despair,
to lead to sin. God's righteousness manifested in upholding his people,
baffling their foes, etc.

[Psa 129:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001). - The enemies of God's
church.

I. Their violence, "The plowers plowed," etc.

II\. Their persistency: "Many a time.... from my youth."

III\. Their failure: "Yet they have not prevailed."

IV\. Their great opponent: "The Lord.... hath cut asunder." - J. F.

[Psa 129:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#003). -

I. Literally fulfilled.

1\. In Christ. [Mat 27:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#026); [Mat
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#019); [Mar
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#015); [Luk
18:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#033); [Joh
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#001).

2\. In his followers. [Mat 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#017); [Act
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#023); [Co2
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#005); [Co2
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#023), [Co2
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#024); [Heb
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#036). And frequently in subsequent
persecutions.

II\. Figuratively. In secret calumnies both in Christ and his followers.
- G. R.

[Psa 129:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#004). - Israel's song of
triumph.

I. The Lord is righteous in permitting these afflictions to come upon
his people.

II\. He is righteous in keeping his promise of deliverance to his
people.

III\. He is righteous in visiting the enemies of his people with
judgment. - W. H. J. P.

[Psa 129:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#005). -

I. An inexcusable hatred described: "hate Zion," God's church and Cause.
For,

1\. Her people are righteous.

2\. Her faith is a gospel.

3\. Her mission is peace.

4\. Her very existence is the world's preservation.

II\. An inveterate sinfulness indicated, "Them that hate Zion." For,
whatever moral virtues they may boast of, they must be,

1\. Enemies to the human race.

2\. In defiant opposition to God.

3\. Perversely blind, as Saul, or radically vile.

4\. Devil-like.

III\. An instinctive feeling of a good man expressed: "Let them all be,"
etc. Prompted by,

1\. His love to God.

2\. Love to man.

3\. Love to righteousness. Hence, its existence is in itself a pledge
that the righteous God will respect and comply with it. - J. F.

[Psa 129:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#005). -

I. The characters described.

1\. They do not love Zion. They say not, "Lord, I have loved the
habitation of thine house," etc.

3\. Disappointment. No mowing; no reaping.

4\. Dishonour. Unblessed by others as well as in themselves. - G. R.

Verses 6-9. - The wicked flourishing and perishing.

I. Eminent in position.

II\. Envied in prosperity.

III\. Evanescent in duration.

IV\. Empty as to solidity.

V. Excepted from blessing.

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Whole Psalm

In the "degrees" of Christian virtue the Psalm corresponds to the tenth
step, which is patience in adversity. - H. T. Armfield.

Whole Psalm

The following incident in connection with the glorious return of the
Vaudois under Henri Arnaud is related in Muston's "Israel of the Alps":
- "After these successes the gallant patriots took an oath of fidelity
to each other, and celebrated divine service in one of their own
churches, for the first time since their banishment. The enthusiasm of
the moment was irrepressible; they chanted the seventy-fourth Psalm to
the clash of arms; and Henri Arnaud, mounting the pulpit with a sword in
one hand and a Bible in the other, preached from the Hundred and
twenty-ninth Psalm, and once more declared, in the face of heaven, that
he would never resume his pastoral office in patience and peace, until
he should witness the restoration of his brethren to their ancient and
rightful settlements."

[Psa 129:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001)

"Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth."

I. How old these afflictions are: "From my youth." Ay, from my infancy,
birth and conception,

II\. There is the frequency and iteration of these afflictions. They
were oft and many: "many a time."

III\. There is the grievousness of these afflictions, expressed by a
comparison. "The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their
furrows." So these were old afflictions - from her youth. They were many
a time: more times than can be numbered. And then they were grievous,
even like iron ploughs, drawing deep and long furrows on their back. -
Alexander Henderson.

[Psa 129:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001)

"Many a time have they afflicted me," etc. God had one Son, and but one
Son, without sin; but never any without sorrow. We may be God's
children, and yet still under persecution; his Israel, and afflicted
from our youth up. We may feel God's hand as a Father upon us when he
strikes us as well as when he strokes us. When he strokes us, it is lest
we faint under his hand; and when he strikes us, it is that we should
know his hand. - Abraham Wright (1611-1690), in "A Practical Commentary
upon the Psalms."

[Psa 129:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001)

"They." The persecutors deserve not a name. The rich man is not named
(as Lazarus is) because not worthy: Luke 16. "They shall be written in
the earth": [Jer 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#013). - John Trapp.

[Psa 129:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001)

"They." In speaking of the enemies of Israel simply by the pronoun
"they," without being more specific, the Psalmist aggravates the
greatness of the evil more than if he had expressly named the Assyrians
or the Egyptians. By not specifying any particular class of foes, he
tacitly intimates that the world is filled with innumerable bands of
enemies, whom Satan easily arms for the destruction of good men, his
object being that new wars may arise continually on every side. History
certainly bears ample testimony that the people of God had not to deal
with a few enemies, but that they were assaulted by almost the whole
world; and further, that they were molested not only by external foes,
but also by those of an internal kind, by such as professed to belong to
the Church. - John Calvin.

[Psa 129:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001)

"They afflicted me." Why are these afflictions of the righteous? Whence
is it that he who has given up his Son to death for them, should deny
them earthly blessings? Why is faith a mourner so frequently here below,
and with all that heroic firmness in her aspect, and hope of glory in
her eye, why needs she to be painted with so deep a sorrow on her
countenance, and the trace of continual tears on her cheek? First, we
reply, for her own safety. Place religion out of the reach of sorrow,
and soon she would pine and perish. God is said to choose his people in
the furnace, because they oftenest choose him there.

It is ever from the cross that the most earnest "My God" proceeds, and
never is the cry heard but he speeds forth at its utterance, who once
hung there, to support, to comfort, and to save.

As it is only in affliction God is sought, so by many it is only in
affliction God is known. This, one of the kings of these worshippers of
the Temple found. "When Manasseh was brought to affliction, then he knew
that the Lord he was God": [Ch2 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#012),
[Ch2 33:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#013).

But, further, it is only by affliction we ourselves are known. What is
the source of that profound and obstinate indifference to divine truth
which prevails among men of the world, except the proud conviction that
they may dispense with it? It is only when they are crushed as the worm
they are made to feel that the dust is their source; only when earthly
props are withdrawn will they take hold of that arm of omnipotence which
Jesus offers, and which he has offered so long in vain.

While men know themselves, they know their sin also in affliction. What
is the natural course and experience of the unbelieving of mankind?
Transgression, remorse, and then forgetfulness; new transgression, new
sorrow, and again forgetfulness. How shall this carelessness be broken?
How convince them that they stand in need of a Saviour as the first and
deepest want of their being, and that they can only secure deliverance
from wrath eternal by a prompt and urgent application to him? By nothing
so effectually as by affliction. God's children, who had forgotten him,
arise and go to their Father when thus smitten by the scourge of sorrow;
and no sooner is the penitent "Father, I have sinned" spoken, than they
are clasped in his arms, and safe and happy in his love.

It is, further, by affliction that the world is known to God's children.
God's great rival is the world. The lust of the flesh, pleasure; the
lust of the eye, desire; the pride of life, the longing to be deemed
superior to those about us, - comprise everything man naturally covets.
Give us ease, honour, distinction, and all life's good will seem
obtained. But what wilt thou do, when he shall judge thee? This is a
question fitted to alarm the happiest of the children of prosperity.

What so frequently and effectually shows the necessity of piety as the
sharp teachings of affliction? They show what moralists and preachers
never could, that riches profit not in the day of death, that pleasures
most fully enjoyed bring no soothing to the terrors which nearness to
eternity presents, and that friends, however affectionate, cannot plead
for and save us at the bar of God. "Miserable comforters are they all,"
and it is for the very purpose of inspiring this conviction, along with
a belief that it is Jesus alone who can comfort in the hour of need,
that affliction is sent to God's children. - Robert Nisbet.

[Psa 129:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001)

"From my youth." The first that ever died, died for religion; so early
came martyrdom into the world. - John Trapp.

[Psa 129:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001), [Psa
129:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#002)

I. The visible Church from the beginning of the world is one body, and,
as it were, one man, growing up from infancy to riper age; for so
speaketh the church here: "Many a time have they afflicted me from my
youth."

II\. The wicked enemies of the church, they also are one body, one
adverse army, from the beginning of the world continuing war against the
church: "Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth."

III\. As the former injuries done to the church are owned by the church,
in after-ages, as done against the same body, so also the persecution of
former enemies is imputed and put upon the score of present persecutors:
"Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say."

IV\. New experience of persecution, when they call to mind the exercise
of the church in former ages, serves much for encouragement and
consolation in troubles: "Many a time have they afflicted me from my
youth, may Israel now say."

V. Albeit this hath been the endeavour of the wicked in all ages to
destroy the church, yet God hath still preserved her from age to age:
"Yet they have not prevailed." - David Dickson.

[Psa 129:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001), [Psa
129:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#002)

When the prophet says twice, "They have afflicted me,.... they have
afflicted me," the repetition is not superfluous, it being intended to
teach us that the people of God had not merely once or twice to enter
the conflict, but that their patience had been tried by continual
exercises. - John Calvin.

[Psa 129:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#002)

"Many a time," etc. The Christian Church may adopt the language of the
Hebrew Church: "Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet
they have not prevailed against me." What afflictions were endured by
the Christian Church from her youth up! How feeble was that youth! How
small the number of the apostles to whom our Lord gave his gospel in
charge! How destitute were they of human learning, of worldly influence,
of secular power! To effect their destruction, and to frustrate their
object - the glory of God and the salvation of men - the dungeon and the
mine, the rack and the gibbet, were all successively employed. The
ploughers ploughed their back, and made long their furrows. Their
property was confiscated; their persons were imprisoned; their civil
rights were taken from them; their heads rolled on the scaffold; their
bodies were consumed at the burning pile; they were thrown, amidst the
ringing shouts of the multitude, to the wild beasts of the amphitheatre.
Despite, however, of every opposition, our holy religion took root and
grew upward. Not all the fury of ten persecutions could exterminate it
from the earth. The teeth of wild beasts could not grind it to powder;
the fire could not burn it; the waters could not drown it; the dungeon
could not confine it. Truth is eternal, like the great God from whose
bosom it springs, and therefore it cannot be destroyed. And because
Christianity is the truth, and no lie, her enemies have never prevailed
against her. - M. M'Michael.

[Psa 129:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#002)

"Yet they have not prevailed against me." The words are the same as in
[Gen 32:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#028). The blessing won by Jacob,
when he wrestled with the angel, remained on his descendants. During the
long night of the Captivity the faithful had wrestled in faithful
prayer; now the morning had appeared, and Israel was raised to a higher
stage of privilege. - W. Kay.

[Psa 129:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#002)

"Yet they have not prevailed against me." Israel prevailed with God in
wrestling with him, and therefore it is that he prevails with men also.
If so be that we will wrestle with God for a blessing, and prevail with
him, then we need not to fear but we shall wrestle the enemies out of it
also. If we be the people of God, and persist in wrestling against his
enemies, we need not fear but that we shall be victorious. - Alexander
Henderson.

[Psa 129:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#003)

"The plowers plowed," etc. There does not seem to be any need to look
for an interpretation of this in scourging or any other bodily
infliction of pain; it seems to be "a figurative mode of expressing
severe oppression." Roberts informs us that when, in the East, a man is
in much trouble through oppressors, he says, "How they plough me and
turn me up." - Ingram Cobbin, 1839.

[Psa 129:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#003)

"The plowers plowed," etc. The great Husbandman who owns this plough (at
least by whose permission this plough goes), is God. Not only is it God
who makes your common ploughs to gang, and sends the gospel into a land,
but it is God also who disposes and overrules this same plough of
persecution. For without his licence the plough cannot be yoked; and
being yoked, cannot enter to gang till he direct; and he tempers the
irons, so that they cannot go one inch deeper than he thinks meet. When
he thinks it time to quit work, then presently he cuts their cords, so
that they cannot go once about after he thinks it time to quit work.
Albeit when they yoke, they resolve to have all the land upside down,
yet he will let them plough no more of it than he sees meet. Now for the
ploughmen of this plough, they are Satan and the evil angels; they hold
the plough, and are goad-men to it; and they yoke in the oxen into the
plough, and drive them up with their goads. And they have a sort of
music also, which they whistle into their ears, to make them go the
faster; and that is the allurements and provocations of the world. And
for the oxen who draw into this plough, it may be princes when they turn
persecutors of the kirk; it may be prelates; it may be politicians in
the world: these are the oxen, Satan and the ill spirits inciting them,
and stirring them up to go forward in their intended course. Then
consider here that the plough and the ploughmen and oxen go about as God
thinks meet; but what is it that they are doing in the meantime? Nothing
else but preparing the ground for seed, and so the Lord employs them to
prepare his people better to receive the seed of his word and of his
Spirit. - Alexander Henderson.

[Psa 129:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#003)

God fails not to sow blessings in the furrows, which the plowers plow
upon the back of the church. - Jeremy Taylor, 1613-1667.

[Psa 129:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#003)

"The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows." When
the Lord Jesus Christ was in his suffering state, and during his
passion, these words here predicted of him were most expressly realized.
Whilst he remained in the hands of the Roman soldiers they stript him of
his raiment; they bound him with cords to a pillar; they flogged him.
This was so performed by them, that they made ridges in his back and
sides; they tore skin and flesh, and made him bare even to the bone, so
that his body was like a ploughed field; the gashes made in it were like
ridges made in a ploughed field; these were on his back. "The plowers
plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows." Whilst every part of
our Lord's sorrows and sufferings is most minutely set forth in the
sacred hymns, Psalms, and songs, contained in what we style the Book of
Psalms, yet we shall never comprehend what our most blessed Lord, in
every part of his life, and in his passion and death, underwent for us:
may the Lord the Spirit imprint this fresh expression used on this
subject effectually upon us. Our Lord's words here are very expressive
of the violence of his tormentors and their rage against him, and of the
wounds and torments they had inflicted on him.

What must the feelings of our Lord have been when they made such furrows
on his back, that it was all furrowed and welted with such long wounds,
that it was more like a ploughed field than anything else. Blessings on
him for his grace and patience, it is "with his stripes we are healed."
- Samuel Eyles Pierce.

[Psa 129:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#003)

"They made long their furrows." The apparent harshness of this figure
will disappear if it be considered to refer to severe public scourgings.
To those who have been so unhappy as to witness such scourgings this
allusion will then appear most expressive. The long weals or wounds
which the scourge leaves at each stroke may most aptly be compared
either to furrows or (as the original admits) to the ridges between the
furrows. The furrows made by the plough in the East are very
superficial, and (although straight) are usually carried to a great
length, the fields not being enclosed as in this country. - John Kitto,
in "The Pictorial Bible."

[Psa 129:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#004)

"The Lord is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked;"
i.e., he has put an end to their domination and tyranny over us. In the
Hebrew word which is rendered "cords" there is a reference to the
harness with which the oxen were fastened to the plough; and so to the
involved machinations and cruelties of the enemy. The Hebrew word
properly denotes thick twisted cords'; figuratively, intertwined
wickedness; [Mic 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#003). "The cords of
the wicked," therefore, signify their power, dominion, tyranny,
wickedness, and violence. These cords God is said "to have cut," so that
he should have made an end; and, therefore, "lo have cut" for ever, so
that they should never be reunited. - Hermann Venema.

[Psa 129:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#004)

"He hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked." The enemies' power has
been broken; God has cut asunder the cords of the wicked, has cut their
gears, their traces, and so spoiled their ploughing; has cut their
scourges, and so spoiled their lashing; has cut the bands of union, by
which they were combined together, he has cut the bands of captivity, in
which they held God's people. God has many ways of disabling wicked men
to do the mischief they design against his church, and shaming their
counsels' - Matthew Henry.

[Psa 129:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#004)

"He hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked." He repeateth the same
praise of God in delivering his church from oppression of the enemy,
under the similitude of cutting the cords of the plough, which tilleth
up another man's field. Whence learn,

I. The enemies of the church do no more regard her than they do the
earth under their feet, and do seek to make their own advantage of her,
as usurpers use to do in possessing and labouring of another man's
field. "The plowers plowed upon my back."

II\. The Lord useth to suffer his enemies to break up the fallow ground
of his people's proud and stiff hearts with the plough of persecution,
and to draw deep and long furrows on them: "They made long their
furrows."

III\. What the enemies do against the church the Lord maketh use of for
manuring the church, which is his field, albeit they intend no good to
God's church, yet they serve in God's wisdom to prepare the Lord's
people for receiving the seed of God's word; for the similitude speaketh
of their tilling of the church, but nothing of their sowing, for that is
reserved for the Lord himself, who is owner of the field.

IV\. When the wicked have performed so much of God's husbandry as he
thinketh good to suffer them, then he stoppeth their design, and looseth
their plough. "He hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked." - David
Dickson.

[Psa 129:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#005)

If any one be desirous to accept these words, "Let them be confounded
and turned backward," as they sound, he will devoutly explain the
imprecation: that is to say, it may be an imprecation of good confusion,
which leads to repentance, and of turning to God from sin; thus
Bellarmine. There is a confounding by bringing grace, glory, and turning
from the evil way. Thus some enemies and persecutors of the Christians
have been holily confounded and turned to the faith of Christ; as St.
Paul, who full of wrath and slaughter was going to Damascus that he
might afflict the believers, but was graciously confounded on the road.
- Thomas Le Blanc.

[Psa 129:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#005)

"Let them all be confounded." Mr. Emerson told a convention of
rationalists once, in this city, that the morality of the New Testament
is scientific and perfect. But the morality of the New Testament is that
of the Old. "Yes," you say; "but what of the imprecatory Psalms?" A
renowned professor, who, as Germany thinks, has done more for New
England theology than any man since Jonathan Edwards, was once walking
in this city with a clergyman of a radical faith, who objected to the
doctrine that the Bible is inspired, and did so on the ground of the
imprecatory Psalms. The replies of the usual kind were made; and it was
presumed that David expressed the Diviue purpose in praying that his
enemies might be destroyed, and that he gave utterance only to the
natural, righteous indignation of conscience against unspeakable
iniquity. But the doubter would not be satisfied. The two came at last
to a newspaper bulletin, on which the words were written, - "Baltimore
to be shelled at twelve o'clock." "I am glad of it," said the radical
preacher; "I am glad of it." "And so am I," said his companion, "but I
hardly dare say so, for fear you should say that I am uttering an
imprecatory Psalm." - Joseph Cook, in Boston Monday Lectures.
"Transcendentalism."

[Psa 129:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#005)

"And turned back;" from pursuing their designs and accomplishing them;
as the Assyrian monarch was, who had a hook put into his nose, and a
bridle in his lips, and was turned back by the way he came: [Isa
37:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#029). - John Gill.

[Psa 129:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#005)

"All those who hate Zion." Note that he does not say, All who hate me;
but "all who hate Zion." Thus the saints are not led to this from the
desire of revenge, but from zeal for the people of God, so that they
pray for the confusion and repression of the ungodly. - Wolfgang
Musculus.

[Psa 129:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#006)

"Let them be as the grass upon the housetops." They are rightly compared
to "grass on the housetops;" for more contemptuously the Holy Ghost
could not speak of them. For this grass is such, that it soon withereth
away before the sickle be put into it. Yea, no man thinketh it worthy to
be cut down, no man regardeth it, every man suffereth it to brag for a
while, and to show itself unto men from the housetops as though it were
something when it is nothing. So the wicked persecutors in the world,
which are taken to be mighty and terrible according to the outward show,
are of all men most contemptible. For Christians do not once think of
plucking them up or cutting them down; they persecute them not, they
revenge not their own injuries, but suffer them to increase, to brag and
glory as much as they list. For they know that they cannot abide the
violence of a vehement wind. Yea, though all things be in quietness, yet
as grass upon the housetops, by little and little, withereth away
through the heat of the sun, so tyrannies upon small occasions do perish
and soon vanish away. The faithful, therefore, in suffering do prevail
and overcome; but the wicked in doing are overthrown, and miserably
perish, as all the histories of all times and ages do plainly witness. -
Martin Luther.

[Psa 129:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#006)

"Like grass upon the housetops." The fiat roofs of the Eastern houses
"are plastered with a composition of mortar, tar, ashes, and sand," in
the crevices of which grass often springs. The houses of the poor in the
country were formed of a plaster of mud and straw, where the grass would
grow still more freely: as all the images are taken from country life,
it is doubtless to country dwellings that the poet refers. - J. J.
Stewart Perowne.

[Psa 129:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#006)

"Like grass upon the housetops." The enemies of Zion may have an
elevated position in the nation, they may seem to promise growth, but
having no root in themselves, like the hearers on the stony ground, give
no promise of fruit. Their profession dies away and leaves no benefit to
the church, as it claims no blessing from others. - William Wilson
(1783-1873), in "The Book of Psalms, with an Exposition."

[Psa 129:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#006)

"Grass upon the housetops." In the morning the master of the house laid
in a stock of earth, which was carried up, and spread evenly on the top
of the house, which is flat. The whole roof is thus formed of mere
earth, laid on and rolled hard and fiat. On the top of every house is a
large stone roller, for the purpose of hardening and flattening this
layer of rude soil, so that the rain may not penetrate; but upon this
surface, as may be supposed, grass and weeds grow freely, but never come
to maturity. It is to such grass the Psalmist alludes as useless and
bad. - William Jowett, in "Christian Researches in Syria and the Holy
Land," 1825.

[Psa 129:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#007)

"The mower filleth not his hand," etc. The grain was rather pulled than
cut, and as each handful was taken the reaper gave it a flourishing
swing up into his bosom. - Mrs. Finn, in "Home in the Holy Land," 1866.

[Psa 129:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#007)

"He that bindeth sheaves his bosom." A practice prevails in hot climates
of sending out persons into the woods and other wild places to collect
the grass, which would otherwise be wasted; and it is no uncommon thing
in the evening to see groups of grass-cutters in the market, waiting to
dispose of their bundles or sheaves, which are often so large that one
is disposed to wonder how they could have been conveyed from the woods
upon one man's shoulders. - Maria Calcott, in "A Scripture Herbal,"
1842.

[Psa 129:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#008)

The latter expressions are most refreshingly Arabic. Nothing is more
natural than for them, when passing by a fruit-tree or corn-field loaded
with a rich crop to exclaim, "Barak Allah!" God bless you! We bless you
in the name of the Lord! - W. M. Thomson.

[Psalms 129:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 129:1</span></span>

1 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say:

2 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, yet they have not
prevailed against me.

3 The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.

4 The Lord is righteous - he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.

5 Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.

6 Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore it
groweth up:

7 Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves
his bosom.

8 Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the Lord be upon you:
we bless you in the name of the Lord.

[Psa 129:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001)

"Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say."
In her present hour of trial, she may remember her former afflictions
and speak of them for her comfort, drawing from them the assurance that
he who has been with her for so long will not desert her in the end. The
song begins abruptly. The poet has been musing, and the fire burns,
therefore speaks he with his tongue: he cannot help it, he feels that he
must speak, and therefore "may now say" what he has to say. The trials
of the church have been repeated again and again, times beyond all
count: the same afflictions are fulfilled in us as in our fathers. Jacob
of old found his days full of trouble; each Israelite is often harassed;
and Israel as a whole has proceeded from tribulation to tribulation.
"Many a time," Israel says, because she could not say how many times.
She speaks of her assailants as "they," because it would be impossible
to write or even to know all their names. They had straitened, harassed,
and fought against her from the earliest days of her history - from her
youth; and they had continued their assaults right on without ceasing.
Persecution is the heirloom of the church, and the ensign of the elect.
Israel among the nations was peculiar, and this peculiarity brought
against her many restless foes, who could never be easy unless they were
warring against the people of God. When in Canaan, at the first, the
chosen household was often severely tried; in Egypt it was heavily
oppressed; in the wilderness it was fiercely assailed; and in the
promised land it was often surrounded by deadly enemies. It was
something for the afflicted nation, that it survived to say, "Many a
time have they afflicted me." The affliction began early - "from my
youth"; and it continued late. The earliest years of Israel and of the
church of God were spent in trial. Babes in grace are cradled in
opposition. No sooner is the man-child born than the dragon is after it.
"It is," however, "good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth,"
and he shall see it to be so when in after days he tells the tale.

[Psa 129:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#002)

"Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth." Israel repeats her
statement of her repeated afflictions. The fact was uppermost in her
thoughts, and she could not help soliloquizing upon it again and again.
These repetitions are after the manner of poetry: thus she makes a
sonnet out of her sorrows, music out of her miseries. "Yet they have not
prevailed against me." We seem to hear the beat of timbrels and the
clash of cymbals here: the foe is derided; his malice has failed. That
"yet" breaks in like the blast of trumpets, or the roll of kettledrums.
"Cast down, but not destroyed," is the shout of a victor. Israel has
wrestled, and has overcome in the struggle. Who wonders? If Israel
overcame the angel of the covenant, what man or devil shall vanquish
him? The fight was oft renewed and long protracted: the champion
severely felt the conflict, and was at times fearful Of the issue; but
at length he takes breath, and cries, "Yet they have not prevailed
against me." "Many a time;" yes, "many a time," the enemy has had his
opportunity and his vantage, but not so much as once has he gained the
victory.

[Psa 129:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#003)

"The plowers plowed upon my back." The scourgers tore the flesh as
ploughmen furrow a field. The people were maltreated like a criminal
given over to the lictors with their cruel whips; the back of the nation
was scored and furrowed by oppression. It is a grand piece of imagery
condensed into few words. A writer says the metaphor is muddled, but he
is mistaken, there are several figures, like wheel within wheel, but
there is no confusion. The afflicted nation was, as it were, lashed by
her adversaries so cruelly that each blow left a long red mark, or
perhaps a bleeding wound, upon her back and shoulders, comparable to a
furrow which tears up the ground from one end of the field to the other.
Many a heart has been in like case; smitten and sore wounded by them
that use the scourge of the tongue; so smitten that their whole
character has been cut up and scored by calumny. The true church has in
every age had fellowship with her Lord under his cruel flagellations:
his sufferings were a prophecy of what she would be called hereafter to
endure, and the foreshadowing has been fulfilled. Zion has in this sense
been ploughed as a field.

"They made long their furrows:" - as if delighting in their cruel
labour. They missed not an inch, but went from end to end of the field,
meaning to make thorough work of their congenial engagement. Those who
laid on the scourge did it with a thoroughness which showed how hearty
was their hate. Assuredly the enemies of Christ's church never spare
pains to inflict the utmost injury, they never do the work of the devil
deceitfully, or hold back their hand from blood. They smite so as to
plough into the man; they plough the quivering flesh as if it were clods
of clay; they plough deep and long with countless furrows; until they
leave no portion of the church unfurrowed or unassailed. Ah me! Well did
Latimer say that there was no busier ploughman in all the world than the
devil: whoever makes short furrows, he does not. Whoever baulks and
shirks, he is thorough in all that he does. Whoever stops work at
sundown, he never does. He and his children plough like practised
ploughmen; but they prefer to carry on their pernicious work upon the
saints behind their backs, for they are as cowardly as they are cruel.

[Psa 129:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#004)

"The Lord is righteous." Whatever men may be, Jehovah remains just, and
will therefore keep covenant with his people and deal out justice to
their oppressors. Here is the hinge of the condition: this makes the
turning point of Israel's distress. The Lord bears with the long furrows
of the wicked, but he will surely make them cease from their ploughing
before he has done with them. "He hath cut asunder the cords of the
wicked." The rope which binds the oxen to the plough is cut: the cord
which bound the victim is broken; the bond which held the enemies in
cruel unity has snapped. As in [Psa
124:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#007) we read, "the snare is broken;
we are escaped," so here the breaking of the enemies' instrument of
oppression is Israel's release. Sooner or later a righteous God will
interpose, and when he does so, his action will be most effectual; he
does not unfasten, but cuts asunder the harness which the ungodly use in
their labour of hate. Never has God used a nation to chastise his Israel
without destroying that nation when the chastisement has come to a
close: he hates those who hurt his people even though he permits their
hate to triumph for a while for his own purpose. If any man would have
his harness cut, let him begin to plough one of the Lord's fields with
the plough of persecution. The shortest way to ruin is to meddle with a
saint: the divine warning is, "He that toucheth you toucheth the apple
of his eye."

[Psa 129:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#005)

"Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion." And so say
we right heartily: and in this case vox populi is vox Dei, for so it
shall be. If this be an imprecation, let it stand; for our heart says
"Amen" to it. It is but justice that those who hate, harass, and hurt
the good should be brought to naught. Those who confound right and wrong
ought to be confounded, and those who turn back from God ought to be
turned back. Loyal subjects wish ill to those who plot against their
king.

"Confound their politics,

Frustrate their knavish tricks,"

is but a proper wish, and contains within it no trace of personal
ill-will. We desire their welfare as men, their downfall as traitors.
Let their conspiracies be confounded, their policies be turned back. How
can we wish prosperity to those who would destroy that which is dearest
to our hearts? This present age is so flippant that if a man loves the
Saviour he is styled a fanatic, and if he hates the powers of evil he is
named a bigot. As for ourselves, despite all objectors, we join heartily
in this commination; and would revive in our heart the old practice of
Ebal and Gerizim, where those were blessed who bless God, and those were
cursed who make themselves a curse to the righteous. We have heard men
desire a thousand times that the gallows might be the reward of the
assassins who murdered two inoffensive men in Dublin, and we would never
censure the wish; for justice ought to be rendered to the evil as well
as to the good. Besides, the church of God is so useful, so beautiful,
so innocent of harm, so fraught with good, that those who do her wrong
are wronging all mankind and deserve to be treated as the enemies of the
human race. Study a chapter from the "Book of Martyrs," and see if you
do not feel inclined to read an imprecatory Psalm over Bishop Bonner and
Bloody Mary. It may be that some wretched nineteenth century
sentimentalist will blame you: if so, read another over him.

[Psa 129:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#006)

"Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth a fore it
groweth up." Grass on the housetop is soon up and soon down. It sprouts
in the heat, finds enough nutriment to send up a green blade, and then
it dies away before it reaches maturity, because it has neither earth
nor moisture sufficient for its proper development. Before it grows up
it dies; it needs not to be plucked up, for it hastens to decay of
itself. Such is and such ought to be the lot of the enemies of God's
people. Transient is their prosperity; speedy is their destruction. The
height of their position, as it hastens their progress, so it hurries
their doom. Had they been lower in station they had perhaps been longer
in being. "Soon ripe, soon rotten," is an old proverb. Soon plotting and
soon rotting, is a version of the old adage which will suit in this
place. We have seen grass on the rustic thatch of our own country
cottages which will serve for an illustration almost as well as that
which comes up so readily on the fiat roofs and domes of eastern
habitations. The idea is - they make speed to success, and equal speed
to failure. Persecutors are all sound and fury, flash and flame; but
they speedily vanish - more speedily than is common to men. Grass in the
field withers, but not as speedily as grass on the housetops. Without a
mower the tufts of verdure perish from the roofs, and so do opposers
pass away by other deaths than fall to the common lot of men; they are
gone, and none is the worse. If they are missed at all, their absence is
never regretted. Grass on the housetop is a nonentity in the world: the
house is not impoverished when the last blade is dried up, and, even so,
the opposers of Christ pass away, and none lament them. One of the
fathers said of the apostate emperor Julian, "That little cloud will
soon be gone"; and so it was. Every sceptical system of philosophy has
much the same history; and the like may be said of each heresy. Poor,
rootless things, they are and are not: they come and go, even though no
one rises against them. Evil carries the seeds of dissolution within
itself. So let it be.

[Psa 129:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#007)

"Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves
his bosom." When with his sickle the husbandman would cut down the tufts
he found nothing to lay hold upon: the grass promised fairly enough, but
there was no fulfilment, there was nothing to cut or to carry, nothing
for the hand to grasp, nothing for the lap to gather. Easterns carry
their corn in their bosoms, but in this case there was nothing to bear
home. Thus do the wicked come to nothing. By God's just appointment they
prove a disappointment. Their fire ends in smoke: their verdure turns to
vanity; their flourishing is but a form of withering. No one profits by
them, least of all are they profitable to themselves. Their aim is bad,
their work is worse, their end is worst of all.

[Psa 129:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#008)

"Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the Lord be upon you,
we bless you in the name of the Lord." In harvest times men bless each
other in the name of the Lord; but there is nothing in the course and
conduct of the ungodly man to suggest the giving or receiving of a
benediction. Upon a survey of the sinner's life from beginning to end,
we feel more inclined to weep than to rejoice, and we feel bound rather
to wish him failure than success. We dare not use pious expressions as
mere compliments, and hence we dare not wish God-speed to evil men lest
we be partakers of their evil deeds. When persecutors are worrying the
saints, we cannot say, "The blessing of the Lord be upon you." When they
slander the godly and oppose the doctrine of the cross, we dare not
bless them in the name of the Lord. It would be infamous to compromise
the name of the righteous Jehovah by pronouncing his blessing upon
unrighteous deeds.

See how godly men are roughly ploughed by their adversaries, and yet a
harvest comes of it which endures and produces blessing; while the
ungodly, though they flourish for a while and enjoy a complete immunity,
dwelling, as they think, quite above the reach of harm, are found in a
short time to have gone their way and to have left no trace behind.
Lord, number me with thy saints. Let me share their grief if I may also
partake of their glory. Thus would I make this Psalm my own, and magnify
thy name, because thine afflicted ones are not destroyed, and thy
persecuted ones are not forsaken.
