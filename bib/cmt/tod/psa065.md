### [Psalms Chapter 65](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 65:0</span></span>

Title. - This title is very similar to many we have before studied. To
the Chief Musician. It is consigned to the care of the usual overseer of
song. When a man does his work well, there is no use in calling in
others for novelty's sake. A Psalm and Song of David, The Hebrew calls
it a Shur and Mizmor, a combination of psalm and song, which may be best
described by the term, "A Lyrical Poem." In this case the psalm may be
said or sung, and be equally suitable. We have had two such Psalms
before, [Psa 30:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#001) and 40, [Psa
48:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001), and we have now the first of
a little series of four following each other. It was meet that Psalms of
pleading and longing should be followed by hymns of praise.

Subject and Divisions. - David sings of the glory of God in his church,
and in the fields of nature: here is the song both of grace and
providence. It may be that he intended hereby to commemorate a
remarkably plentiful harvest, or to compose a harvest hymn for all ages.
It appears to have been written after a violent rebellion had been
quelled, [Psa 65:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#007), and foreign
enemies had been subdued by signal victory, [Psa
65:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#008). It is one of the most delightful
hymns in any language.

We shall view in the [Psa 65:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001)the
way of approach to God, then [Psa
65:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#005) we shall see the Lord in answer
to prayer performing wonders for which he is praised, and then [Psa
65:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#009) we shall sing the special
harvest-song.

Hints to Preachers

[Psa 65:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001). - The fitness, place, use,
and power of silence in worship.

[Psa 65:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001). - The limitations,
advantages, and obligations of vows.

[Psa 65:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#002) (first clause). - The
hearing and granting of prayer is the Lord's property, his usual
practice, his pleasure, his nature, and his glory. - David Dickson.

[Psa 65:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#003). -

I. The humble confession. Sins prevail against us.

1\. When we are unwatchful, or go into temptation, and even after most
sacred engagements.

2\. How. Through our inbred corruption, natural constitution, suddenness
of temptation, neglect of means of grace, and want of fellowship.

3\. In whom. In the best of men: David says, "against me." Let us take
home the caution.

II\. The reassuring confidence. Sin is forgiven.

1\. By God: "Thou."

2\. By atonement: covering all.

3\. Effectually: "purge away."

4\. Comprehensively: "our transgressions."

[Psa 65:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#003). -

I. A cry of distress. Mansoul besieged: "Iniquities prevail against me."

II\. A shout of delight. Mansoul relieved: "Thou shalt purge them away."
- E.G. Gange.

[Psa 65:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#004). - Nearness to God is the
foundation of a creature's happiness. This doctrine appears in full
evidence, while we consider the three chief ingredients of true
felicity, viz., the contemplation of the noblest object, to satisfy all
the powers of the understanding; the love of the supreme good, to answer
the utmost propensities of the will, and the sweet and everlasting
sensation and assurance of the love of an Almighty Friend, who will free
us from all the evils which our nature can fear, and confer upon us all
the good which a wise and innocent creature can desire. Thus all the
capacities of man are employed in their highest and sweetest exercises
and enjoyments. - Isaac Watts.

[Psa 65:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#004). - Election, effectual
calling, access, adoption, final perseverance, satisfaction. This verse
is a body of divinity in miniature.

[Psa 65:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#005). - Treat the first clause
experimentally, and show how prayers for our own sanctification are
answered by trial; for God's glory, by our persecution; for our babes'
salvation, by their death; for the good of others, by their sickness,
etc., etc.

[Psa 65:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#007). - The Lord, the giver,
creator, and preserver of peace.

[Psa 65:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#008). - Tokens of God's presence;
those causing terror, and those inspiring joy.

[Psa 65:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#008) (last clause). - The
peculiar joys of morning and evening.

[Psa 65:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#009). - "The river of God." John
Bunyan's treatise on "The Water of Life" would be suggestive on this
topic.

[Psa 65:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#009). - Divine visits and their
consequences.

[Psa 65:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#009). - A Harvest Sermon.

I. The general goodness of God. Visiting the earth in rotation of
seasons: "Seed time and harvest," etc.

II\. The greatness of his resources: "The river of God, which is full of
water;" not like Elijah's brook, which dried up.

III\. The variety of his benefactions: "Corn;" "Water;" "Blessest the
springing thereof," etc.

IV\. The perpetuity of his blessings: "Crownest the year." - E. G. G.

[Psa 65:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#010). - Divine grace like rain.

I. In itself.

II\. In its abundance.

III\. In its effects on the heart and entire nature; falling on ridge
and furrow; softening, etc.

IV\. In its fruitful results. See the extract from Ralph Robinson in
loc.

[Psa 65:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#010) (last clause). - See
"Spurgeon's Sermons," No. 675: "Spring in the Heart."

[Psa 65:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#011). - See "Spurgeon's
Sermons," No. 532: "Thanksgiving and Prayer."

[Psa 65:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#012) (first clause). -

I. Our dwelling place: "the wilderness."

II\. Our spiritual provision: "pastures."

III\. Our heavenly refreshment: "they drop."

[Psa 65:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#012). - Causes for joy for small
churches. God remembers them, stablishes and increases them, feeds them
and revives them, etc.

[Psa 65:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#013). - The song of nature and
the ear which hears it.

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

From [Psa 65:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001) onwards we find
ourselves in the midst of a series of Psalms which, with a varying
arrangement of the words, are inscribed both מזמו and שׁיר) ([Psa
65:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001)) The two words signify a
Psalm-song, This series, as is universally the case, is arranged
according to the community of, prominent watchwords. In [Psa
65:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#002) we read: "To thee is the vow
paid;" and in [Psa 66:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#013) : "I will pay
thee my vows;" in [Psa 66:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#020) :
"Blessed be Elohim;" and in 67:8: "Elohim shall bless us." Besides
Psalms 66 and [Psa 67:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#001) have this
feature in common, that למנץ־ח, which occurs fifty-five times in the
Psalter, is accompanied by the name of the poet in every instance, with
the exception of these two anonymous Psalms. The frequently occurring
Sela of both Psalms also indicates that they were intended to have a
musical accompaniment - Franz Delitzsch.

Title

A Psalm of Jeremiah and Ezekiel. - The Psalm is assigned to them, not as
being its authors, but because it is supposed that it was often
rehearsed by them at the beginning of the return from captivity, to
teach us that those things ought especially to be sung concerning that
happy restoration which these prophets were wont to sing about. But this
inscription is not in the Hebrew text, nor in some translations, but
only in certain versions. Jeremiah was not carried away to Babylon; see
[Jer 39:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#011), etc. Moreover, both he and
Ezekiel died before the return. - Pool's Synopsis.

Whole Psalm

The author of the Psalm is mentioned, but not the date of its
composition; but, from an examination of its contents, it would seem to
have been intended as a song for the "day of atonement," and for the
"feast of tabernacles," which followed immediately after. [Num
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#007), [Num
29:12](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#012). The sins of the year were then
"covered over," and a thorough purification of the sanctuary was made by
a special service of expiation. The labours of the year were also by
that time all concluded, and its fruits secured; and Israel could look
on the goodness of God towards them, through its entire extent; and this
Psalm was penned to serve as a fitting expression of their feelings, It
opens with a reference to the "silence" that reigned in the sanctuary;
to the profound, unbroken, solemn stillness that reigned within it;
while, in deep abasement, the people without waited in hushed
expectation the return of their high priest from the immediate presence
of God. [Lev 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#017). It goes on to a
statement of the blessedness of those who are accepted of God, and
admitted to fellowship with One so unspeakably great; and concludes with
a description of the various processes by which the Almighty had fitted
the earth to yield a year's supplies for his people. - Dalman Hapstone
in "The Ancient Psalms in appropriate Metres ... with Notes." 1867.

Whole Psalm

We have here a psalm of thanksgiving to be sung in the Temple during a
public festivity, at which the sacrifices were to be offered which had
been vowed during a long and protracted drought ([Psa
65:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001)). To the thanksgiving, however,
for a gracious rain, and the hope of an abundant harvest (verses 9-14),
is added gratitude for a signal deliverance during a time of distress
and commotion affecting all the nations around ([Psa
65:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#007)). Thus the Psalm becomes a song
of praise to Jehovah as the God of history and the God of nature alike.
- From the "Psalms Chronologically Arranged. By Four Friends." 1867.

Whole Psalm

This is a charming psalm. Coming after the previous sad ones, it seems
like the morning after the darkness of night: There is a dewy freshness
about it, and from [Psa 65:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#009) to the
end there is a sweet succession of landscape pictures that reminds one
of the loveliness of spring; and truly it is a description, in natural
figures, of that happy state of men's minds which will be the result of
the "Day-Spring's visiting us from on high." [Luk
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#007), [Luk
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#008). - O. Prescott Hiller.

[Psa 65:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001)

"Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion." The believer sometimes seems
to want words to exalt God, and stops, as it were, in the middle; his
thoughts are overmatched. Thus praise waits, or is silent for God; it is
silent to other things, and it waits to be employed about him. The soul
is often put to a nonplus in crying up the grace of God, and wants words
to express its greatness; yea, to answer the elevation of the thoughts;
the heart indites a song of praise, but it is silentium intellectus),
for when the mind can rise no higher, it falls admiring; hence some say,
God is most exalted with fewest words. - Alexander Carmichael.

[Psa 65:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001)

"Praise waiteth for thee, O God." Mercy is not yet come, we expect it:
whilst thou art preparing the mercy, we are preparing the praise. -
Edward Leigh in "Annotations on the Five Poetical Books of the Old
Testament." 1657.

[Psa 65:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001)

"Praise waiteth on thee." As a servant, whose duty it is to do what thou
commandest; or, for thee; is ready to be offered in thy courts for
special favours. I think there is an allusion to the dally service in
which God was praised. - Benjamin Boothroyd.

[Psa 65:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001)

"Praise Waiteth for thee, O God," Te decet hymnus, so the vulgar edition
reads this place. To thee, O Lord, belong our hymns, our psalms, our
praises, our cheerful acclamations, and conformable to that, we
translate it, "Praise waiteth for thee, O God." But if we take it
according to the original, it must be tibi silentium laus est, Thy
praise, O Lord, consists in silence. That man praises God best that says
least of him; of his mysterious essence, of his unrevealed will and
secret purposes. - Abraham Wright.

[Psa 65:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001)

"To thee is silence and praise." - Piscator.

[Psa 65:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001)

"The Hebrew may be rendered, Praise is silent for thee." As if the holy
man had said, "Lord," I quietly wait for a time to praise thee; my soul
is not in an uproar because thou stayest. I am not murmuring, but rather
stringing my harp and tuning my instrument with much patience and
confidence, that I may be ready to strike up when the joyful news of my
deliverance come. - William Gurnall.

[Psa 65:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001)

"To thee belongeth silence-praise." Praise without any tumult.
(Alexander.) It has been said, "The most intense feeling is the most
calm, being condensed by repression." And Hooker says of prayer, "The
very silence which our unworthiness putteth us unto doth itself make
request for us, and that in the confidence of his grace. Looking inward,
we are stricken dumb; looking upward, we speak and prevail." Horsley
renders it, "Upon thee is the repose of prayer.". - Andrew A. Bonar.

[Psa 65:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001)

"Praise is silent for thee." The Chaldee interpretation is, that our
praise is not sufficiently worthy that we should praise God. The very
praises of angels are esteemed as nothing before him. For so its
rendering is "Before thee, O God, whose Majesty dwells in Zion, the
praise of angels is regarded as silence." Jerome's version here is, "To
thee silence is praise, O God, in Zion." Atheneus says, silence is a
divine thing; and Thomas Kempis calls silence the nutriment of devotion.
- Thomas Le Blanc.

[Psa 65:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001)

"To thee belong submission, praise, O God, in Sion." \[Version of the
American Bible Union.\] Thou hast a claim for submission in times of
sorrow, for praise in seasons of joy. - Thomas J. Conant, in "The Psalms
... with occasional Notes." 1871.

[Psa 65:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001)

"Vow." A vow is a voluntary and deliberate promise made unto God in an
extraordinary case. "It is a religious promise made unto God in a holy
manner:" so a modern writer defines it. It is a "holy and religious
promise advisedly and freely made unto God, concerning something which
to do or to omit appeareth to be grateful and well-pleasing unto him."
so Bucanus. I forbear Aquinas's definition of a vow. It these which I
have given satisfy not, then view it in the words of Peter Martyr, a man
of repute, and well-known to our own nation in the days of Edward VI.,
of ever-blessed memory: "It is a holy promise, whereby we bind ourselves
to offer somewhat unto God." There is one more who defines it, and he is
a man whose judgment, learning, and holiness hath perfumed his name; it
is learned Perkins, in his "Cases of Conscience." "A vow," saith he, "is
a promise made unto God of things lawful and possible." - Henry Hurst in
The Morning Exercises. ( - 1690)

[Psa 65:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001) (last clause)

The reference here is to the vows or promises which the people had made
in view of the manifested judgments of God, and the proofs of his
goodness. Those vows they were now ready to carry out in expressions of
praise. - Albert Barnes.

[Psa 65:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#002)

"O thou that hearest prayer," etc. This is one of his titles of honour,
he is a God that hears prayer; and it is as truly ascribed to him as
mercy or justice. He hears all prayer, therefore, "unto thee shall all
flesh come." He never rejects any that deserves the name of prayer, how
weak, how unworthy soever the petitioner be. "All flesh!" And will he
(may faith say) reject mine only? Rein. [Psa
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#012), "He is rich unto all that call
upon him;" [Psa 86:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#005), "Thou art
plenteous in mercy to all that call upon thee;" [Heb
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#006). "A rewarder of them that
diligently seek him." This must be believed as certainly as we believe
that God is. As sure as God is the true God, so sure is it that none who
sought him diligently departed from him without a reward. He rewards all
seekers, for indefinita in materia necessaria aequipollet universali.
And if all, why not me? You may as well doubt that he is God, as doubt
that he will not reward, not hear prayer; so [Jam
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#005), "If any of you lack wisdom, let
him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not;
and it shall be given him." - David Clarkson.

[Psa 65:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#002)

"O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come." What
avails prayer, if it be not heard? But God's people need not lay it
aside on that score. Our text bears two things with respect to that
matter. 1. A comfortable title ascribed to God, with the unanimous
consent of all the sons of Zion, who are all praying persons: "O thou
that hearest prayer." He speaks to "God in Zion," or Zion's God, that is
in New Testament language, to God in Christ. An absolute God thundereth
on sinners from Sinai, there can be no comfortable intercourse betwixt
God and them, by the law: but in Zion, from the mercy-seat, in Christ,
he is the hearer of prayer; they give in their supplications, and he
graciously hears them. Such faith of it they have, that praise waits
there for the prayer-hearing God. 2. The effect of the savour of this
title of God, spread abroad in the world: "Unto thee shall all flesh
come:" not only Jews, but Gentiles. The poor Gentiles who have long in
vain implored the aid of their idols, hearing and believing that God is
the hearer of prayer, will flock to him, and present their petitions.
They will throng in about his door, where by the gospel they understand
beggars are so well served. They will "come in even unto thee," Heb.
They will come in even to thy seat, thy throne of grace, even unto
thyself through the Mediator. That God is the hearer of prayer, and will
hear the prayers of his people, is evident from these considerations: -
First. The supernatural instinct of praying that is found in all that
are born of God, [Gal 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006). It is as
natural for them to fall a praying when the grace of God has touched
their hearts, as for children when they are born into the world to cry,
or to desire the breasts. [Zac 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010),
compared with [Act 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#011), where in the
account that is given of Paul, at his conversion, it is particularly
noticed, "Behold he prayeth." Hence the whole saving change on soul
comes under the character of this instinct, [Jer
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#004), [Jer
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#019). Secondly. The intercession of
Christ, [Rom 8:34](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#034). It is a great part
of the work of Christ's intercession to present the prayers of his
people before his Father, [Rev 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#004), to
take their causes in hand, contained in their supplications. [Jo1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001). Thirdly. The promise of the
covenant, whereby God's faithfulness is impawned for the hearing of
prayer, as [Mat 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#007) : see also [Isa
65:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#024). Fourthly. The many
encouragements given in the Word to the people of God, to come with
their cases unto the Lord by prayer. He invites them to his throne of
grace with their petitions for supply of their needs. [Sol
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#014). He sends afflictions to press
them to come. Hoses [Sol 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#015). He
gives them ground of hope of success, [Psa
1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001) :15, whatever extremity their
case is brought to. [Isa 41:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#017). He
shows them that however long he may delay for their trial, yet praying
and not fainting shall be successful at length. [Luk
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#008). Fifthly. The gracious nature of
God, with the endearing relations he stands in to his people. [Exo
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#027). He wants not power and ability
to fulfil the holy desires of his people; he is gracious, and will
withhold no good from them that they really need. He has the bowels of a
father to; pity them, the bowels of a mother to her sucking child. He
has a most tender sympathy with them in all their afflictions, the
touches on them are as on the apple of his eye; and he never refuses
them a request, but for their good. Rein. [Exo
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#028). Sixthly. The experiences which
the saints of all ages have had of the answer of prayer. The faith of it
brings them to God at conversion, as the text intimates; and they that
believe cannot be disappointed. Lastly. The present ease and relief that
prayer sometimes gives to the saints, while yet the full answer of
prayer is not come. [Psa 138:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#003). -
Thomas Boston (1676-1732).

[Psa 65:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#002)

"O thou that hearest prayer." Observe 1. That God is called the hearer
of prayers, since he hears, without distinction of persons, the prayers
of every one poured forth with piety: not only of the Jews but also of
the Gentiles: as in [Act 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#034), [Act
10:35](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#035)..., It follows, therefore, as a
necessary consequence, that all flesh should come to him. 2. To come to
God, is not indeed simply tantamount to saying, to draw near to God, to
adore, call upon, and worship him, but to come to Zion for the purpose
of adoring God; for it was just now said, that God must be praised in
Zion, and to this the phrase, to come to God, must be referred. On this
account also אל is not used, but עד, whose proper force is right up to
God, or to the place of the habitation of God to render adoration to
God. - Hermann Venema.

[Psa 65:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#002)

"To thee shall all flesh come." To Christ "all flesh comes," that is
(1), every sinner and carnal man. He himself says, [Mat
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#013), "I came not to call the
righteous, but sinners." The Grecian priest in olden times, when
approaching to receive the sacrifice, used to exclaim, Who comes there?
and the reply was, 3I any and good. But God receives publicans and
sinners, and inviteth them to his banquet, and eateth with them; but for
the purpose of delivering them from sin. "All flesh shall see the
salvation of God." (2.) All flesh may be taken for the whole flesh, the
whole body; all the senses and members of the body Shall come to God
that they may pay him tribute as their King. - Thomas Le Blanc.

[Psa 65:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#002)

"All flesh." By flesh is meant man in his weakness and need. - J. J.
Stewart Perowne.

[Psa 65:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#003)

"Iniquities prevail against me." There are two ways in which iniquities
may prevail against the Christian - the first is in the growing sense of
his guilt, the second is in the power of their acting, This prevalence
cannot be entire, for sin shall not have dominion over them; but it may
be occasional and partial. There are two ways, according to Scripture,
in which God purges our transgressions; and they always go together. The
one is by pardoning mercy. Thus David prays "Purge me with hyssop, and I
shall be clean." Thus the blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all
sin. The other is by sanctifying grace: "I will sprinkle clean water
upon you, and ye shall be clean." And this is as much the work of God as
the former. He subdues our iniquities as well as forgives them. -
William Jag.

[Psa 65:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#003)

"Iniquities." Literally, Words of iniquities, by some regarded as a
pleonastic phrase for iniquities themselves. More Probably, however, the
phrase means the charge or accusation of iniquity. - Joseph Addison
Alexander.

[Psa 65:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#003)

The deeds of iniquity are said to prevail against us, in so far as they
are too strong and powerful for us to deny or refute, and so subject us
to a demand of those penalties which the sin merits; hence there remains
no other refuge than the clemency and grace of God, the Judge. See [Psa
143:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#002); [Psa
130:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#003); [Psa
4:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001). - Hermann Venema?

[Psa 65:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#003)

"As for our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away." In the Hebrew
it is, Thou shalt hide them. It alludes to the mercy-seat, which was
Covered with the wings of the Cherubim; so are the Sins of the godly,
when repented of, covered with the wings of mercy and favour. - Thomas
Watson.

[Psa 65:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#003)

"Thou shalt purge them away;" or "Thou coverest them." The pronoun is
emphatic, as though to express the conviction that God and God alone
could do this. - J. J. Stewart Perowne.

[Psa 65:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#003)

The holy prophets, and penmen of Scripture, have no grounds of hope for
pardon of sin, save those which are common to the meanest of God's
people; for David, in his confession, cometh in by himself alone,
aggravating his own sins most: "Iniquities prevail against me," saith
he, But in hope of pardon, he joineth with the rest of God's people,
Saying, "As for our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away." - David
Dickson.

[Psa 65:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#003), [Psa
65:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#004)

Now, soul, thou art molested with many lusts that infest thee, and
obstruct thy commerce with heaven; yea, thou hast complained to thy God,
- what loss thou hast suffered by them; is it now presumption to expect
relief from him, that he will rescue thee from them, that thou mayest
serve him without fear, who is thy liege Lord? You have the saints for
your precedents; who, When they have been in combat with their
corruptions, yea, been foiled by them, have even then exercised their
faith on God; and expected the ruin of those enemies, which, for the
present, have overrun them. "Iniquities prevail against me;" he means
his own sins; but see his faith; at the same time that they prevailed
over him, he beholds God destroying them, as appears in the very next
words, "As for our transgressions, thou shalt purge theme away." See
here, poor Christian, who thinkest that thou shalt never get above deck,
holy David has a faith, not only for himself, but also for all
believers, of whose number I suppose thee one. And mark the ground he
hath for this his confidence, taken from God's choosing act: "Blessed is
the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto thee, that he
may dwell in thy courts." As if he had said, Surely he will not let them
be under the power of sin, or in want of his gracious succour, whom he
sets so near himself. This is Christ's own argument against Satan, in
the behalf of his people. "The Lord said unto Satan, the Lord rebuke
thee." [Zac 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#002). - William Gurnall.

[Psa 65:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#004)

"Blessed is the man whom thou choosest." The benedictions of the Psalter
advance in spirituality and indicate a growth. The first blessed the
godly reader of the word. [Psa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001).
The second described the pardoned child. [Psa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001). The third pronounced a blessing
upon faith. [Psa 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#008) and [Psa
40:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#004). The fourth commended the active
and generous believer, abundant in deeds of charity ([Psa
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001)); and this last, mounting to the
fountain head of all benediction, blesses the elect of God. - C. H. S.

[Psa 65:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#004)

"The man whom thou choosest." Christ, whom God chose, and of whom he
said, "This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased," is, indeed,
"over all, God blessed for ever;" but in him his elect are blessed too.
For his sake, not for our own, are we chosen; in him, not in ourselves,
are we received by God, being accepted in the Beloved; and, therefore,
in him are we blessed: he is our blessing. With that High Priest who has
ascended into the holy place and entered within the vail, we enter into
the house of God; we learn to dwell therein; we are filled with its
spiritual joys; we partake of its holy mysteries and sacraments of grace
and love. - From "A Plain Commentary on the Book of Psalms," 1859.

[Psa 65:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#004)

"We shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy
temple." We shall be so filled, that nothing can be said to be wanting,
we shall have nothing to look for outside. What can be wanting, in the
house of him who made everything, who is the master of everything, who
will be all unto all, in whom is an inexhaustible treasure of good. Of
him is said in Psalm 103. "Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things;"
and in [Psa 17:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001). "I shall be
satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness." - Robert Bellarmine
(1542-1621).

[Psa 65:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#004)

"Satisfied with the goodness of thy house." There is an allusion here to
the oblations which were devoted to God, of which, also, sacred persons
partook. - Hermann Venema.

[Psa 65:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#005)

"By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us." The reason
why he answers thus is, because what God doth for his people, take one
thing with another, is still in order to the crucifying of the flesh;
and what more terrible than such a death? We pray for pleasing things,
as we imagine, but as we are flesh as well as spirit; so the flesh hath
still a part in every prayer, and what we beg is partly carnal, and upon
the matter, in part, we beg we know not what. Now, the answer as it
comes from God, take all together, is spiritual, which is a crucifying
thing to sinful flesh; hence comes in all the terror ... You pray for
pardon; that is a pleasing thing, yet rightly understood not pleasing to
the flesh; it mortifies corruption, breaks the heart, engages to a holy
life: every answer from our God to us, one way or the other, first or
last, shall tend that way. God useth so to give good things unto his
children, as withal to give himself, and show to them his heavenly glory
in what is done ... Now God is terrible to sinful flesh: so far as he
appears, it dies. Jacob, therefore, whilst he conquered God in prayer,
himself was overcome, signified by that touch upon his thigh put out of
joint, where the chiefest stress in wrestling lies. When we are weak,
then are we strong; because as God appears, we die unto ourselves and
live in him. - William Carter, in a Fast Sermon entitled, "Light in
Darkness," 1648.

[Psa 65:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#005)

God's judgments are these terribilia, terrible, fearful things; and he
is faithful in his covenant; and by terrible judgments he will answer,
that is, satisfy our expectation: and that is a covenient sense of these
words. But the word which we translate "righteousness" here, is tzadok,
and tzadok is not faithfulness, but holiness; and these "terrible
things" are reverend things; and so Tremellius translates it, and well.
Per res reverendas, by reverend things, things to which there belongs a
reverence - "thou shalt answer us." And thus, the sense of this place
will be, that the God of our salvation (that is, God working in the
Christian church) calls us to holiness, to righteousness, by terrible
things; not terrible in the way and nature of revenge: but terrible that
is stupendous reverend, mysterious; so that we should not make religion
too homely a tiling, but come always to all acts and exercises of
religion with reverence, with fear, and trembling, and make a difference
between religious and civil actions. - John Donne.

[Psa 65:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#005)

God's deliverance of his church and people "by terrible things" is "in
righteousness." The meaning of the point is this: God in all the
deliverances of his people by terrible things, doth therein manifest his
righteousness. He doth therein nothing but what is according to
righteousness and justice. To clear this, consider that there is a
double righteousness, the righteousness of his word, which is the
righteousness of his faithfulness; and the righteousness of his works,
or his just acts of righteousness. And God doth manifest both these in
his deliverance of his people by terrible things. - John Bewick. 1644.

[Psa 65:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#005)

But what is the meaning when they say, "wilt thou answer us?" Us, who
are inhabitants of Zion, who are constituted thy people, and truly
worship Thee; us, moreover, in contact with enemies, who stirred up
strife against us, and wished us ill; us, lastly, who aim at and seek
the stability of the Kingdom and Church, and every kind of felicity and
safety; with such things wilt thou answer us, it says, that is, for our
advantage and benefit, and according to our vows, and therefore by
pleading our cause, and deciding in our favour, and satisfying our
desires; and in this way rendering us happy and establishing us, and
subduing and confounding our foes. - Hermann Venema.

[Psa 65:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#005)

"Who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth." How could God be
the confidence of all the ends of the earth, if he does not reign and
constantly work? The stability of the mountains is ascribed not to
certain physical laws, but to the power of God. The noise of the seas is
stilled not by laws without a powerful agent, but by the immediate
influence of the Almighty Ruler. Human laws also may be the means of
restraining persecution, but they are only means; and it is God who
stilleth the tumult of the people. It is God who maketh the outgoings of
the morning and evening to sing. The Scriptures, in viewing the works
which God does through means, never lose sight of God himself. God
visits and waters the earth: God prepares the corn. Without his own
immediate power, the laws of nature could not produce their effect. How
consoling and satisfactory is this view of Divine Providence, compared
with that of an infidel philosophy, that forbids us to go further back
than to the power of certain physical laws, which it grants, indeed,
were at first established by God, but which can now perform their office
without him. - Alexander Carson. (1776-1844).

[Psa 65:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#005)

"All the ends of the earth." God is in himself potentially, "The
confidence of all the ends of the earth," Hereafter he will be
recognised by all to be so ([Psa
23:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001) :27, 28), of which the Queen of
Sheba's coming to Solomon "from the uttermost parts of the earth" is a
type. [Mat 12:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#042). - A. R. Fausset.

[Psa 65:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#005)

"And of them that are afar off upon the sea." We must beseech God in the
words of this Psalm, that since He stands upon the shore, and beholds
our perils, he would make us, who are tossed on the turbulent sea,
secure for his name's sake, and enable us to hold between Scylla and
Charybdis, the middle course, and escaping the danger on either hand,
with a sound vessel and safe merchandise, reach the port. - Lorinus
(from Augustine).

[Psa 65:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#005)

The divine watering of the earth is obviously symbolical of the descent
of the Holy Spirit after Christ's ascension; and when on the great day
of Pentecost the devout Jews, "out of every nation under heaven," heard
the apostle speaking in their several tongues the wonderful works of
God, it was a testimony that God was beginning spiritually to make "the
outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice." To God "which stilleth
the noise of the waves and the tumult of the people," the apostles
betook themselves in prayer after their first conflict with Jewish
authorities, the first conflict of the infant Christian community with
the powers of this world: the language of the Psalm ([Psa
65:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#005)), "O God of our salvation; who
art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are
afar off upon the sea," is reflected in the opening words of their
prayer on that occasion ([Act 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#024)),
"Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and
all that in them is;" and if, when they prayed, "the place was shaken
where they were assembled together, and they were all filled with the
Holy Ghost," it was no idle sign that "by terrible things in
righteousness" were they being answered by the God of their salvation.
These are, of course, mere illustrations of the inner harmony of
Scripture; but, as such, they may not be without their value. - Joseph
Francis Thrupp.

[Psa 65:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#006)

"Setteth last the mountains." It is by thy strength they have been
raised, and by thy power they are girded about and preserved. He
represents the mountains as being formed and pitched into their proper
places by the mighty hand of God; and shows that they are preserved from
splitting, falling down, or mouldering away, as it were, by a girdle by
which they are surrounded. The image is very fine. They were hooped
about by the divine power. - Adam Clarke.

[Psa 65:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#008)

"Thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice." That
is, thou makest men to rejoice, they are glad, they rejoice in, or at,
the outgoings in the morning. And at the evening men rejoice too, for
then they go to their rest, being wearied with the labour of the day.
Or, we may thus expound it: Thou makest men who live at the outgoings of
the morning, and at the outgoings of the evening, to rejoice. As if it
had been said, Thou makest the eastern people and the western people,
all people from east to west, rejoice. And that which makes all people
to rejoice, naturally, is the rising of light with them in the east, and
the coming of light towards them in the west. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 65:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#008)

"Thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice." How
contrary soever light and darkness are to each other, and how inviolable
Soever the partition between them ([Gen
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#004)), both are equally welcome to the
world in their season; it is hard to say which is more welcome to us,
the light of the morning which befriends the business of the day, or the
shadows of the evening which befriend the repose of the night. Doth the
watchman wait for the morning? so doth the hireling earnestly desire the
shadow. Some understand it for the morning and evening sacrifice, which
good people greatly rejoiced in, and in which God was constantly
honoured. Thou makest them to sing, so the word is; for every morning
and every evening songs of praise were sung by the Levites; it was that
which the duty of every day required. And we are to look upon our daily
worship alone, and with our families, to be both the most needful of our
daily business, and the most delightful of our daily comforts; and if
therein we keep up our communion with God, the outgoings both of the
morning and of the evening are thereby made truly to rejoice. - Matthew
Henry.

[Psa 65:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#008)

Lyranus, Dionysius Carthusianus, Cajetanus, Placidus Parmensis, (who
treads in the footsteps of Cajetanus though he does not mention him,)
take the first clause to refer to the wonder of all mankind at the
wonderful works of God on the land and the sea; and explain the second
respecting the sacrifices which were wont to be offered in the morning
and evening: that God made these acceptable to himself and delightful to
those who offered them, especially after the return from captivity. In
the beginning of the Psalm sacrifices are hinted at by praise and vows,
as we have seen, and in the history of Esdra it is recorded, that the
morning and evening sacrifice were offered unto the Lord by those who
had returned; and that those who approached, when they entered, and
others who had made their offerings, when they departed, gave praises to
God. Hence it is here said, that the outgoings of the morning and of the
evening, that is to say, when they who praise God go forth from either
sacrifice, God will be well pleased, he will receive delight from that
praise, and it will be grateful to him. - Lorinus.

[Psa 65:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#008)

Figuratively, "the outgoing of the morning," or dawn, is the light of
grace in the beginning of conversion; "the outgoing of the evening" is
the fine light of grace in the hour of death. - Thomas Le Blanc.

[Psa 65:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#009)

"Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it," etc. How beautiful are the
words of the inspired poet, read in this month of harvest, nearly three
thousand years after they were written! For nearly three thousand years
since the royal poet looked over the plains of Judea covered with the
bounty of God, and broke forth into his magnificent hymn of praise, has
the earth rolled on in her course, and the hand of God has blessed her,
and all her children, with seed-time and harvest, with joy and
abundance. The very steadfastness of the Almighty's liberality, flowing
like a mighty ocean through the infinite vast of the universe, makes his
creatures forget to wonder at its wonderfulness, to feel true
thankfulness at its immeasurable goodness. The sun rises and sets so
surely; the seasons run on amid all their changes with such inimitable
truth, that we take as a matter of course that which is amazing beyond
all stretch of imagination, and good beyond the widest expansion of the
noblest human heart.

The poor man, with his half-dozen children, toils, and often dies, under
the vain labour of winning bread for them. God feeds his family of
countless myriads swarming over the surface of all countless worlds, and
none know need but through the follies of themselves, or the cruelty of
their fellows. God pours his light from innumerable suns on innumerable
rejoicing planets; he waters them everywhere in the fittest moment; he
ripens the food of globes and of nations, and gives them fair weather to
garner it. And from age to age, amid his endless creatures of endless
forms and powers, in the beauty and the sunshine, and the magnificence
of nature, he seems to sing throughout creation the glorious song of his
own divine joy, in the immortality of his youth, in the omnipotence of
his nature, in the eternity of his patience, and the abounding
boundlessness of his love. What a family hangs on his sustaining arm!
The life and soul of infinite ages, and of uncounted worlds! Let a
moment's failure of his power, of his watchfulness, or of his will to do
good, occur, and what a sweep of death and annihilation through the
universe! How stars would reel, planets expire, and nations perish! But
from age to age, no such catastrophe occurs, even in the midst of
national crimes, and of atheism that denies the hand that made and feeds
it. Life springs with a power ever new; food springs up as plentifully
to sustain it, and sunshine and joy are poured over all from the
invisible throne of God, as the poetry of the existence which he has
given. If there come seasons of dearth, or of failure, they come but as
warnings to proud and tyrannic man. The potato is smitten that a nation
may not be oppressed for ever; and the harvest is diminished that the
laws of man's unnatural avarice may be rent asunder. And then, again,
the sun shines, the rain falls, and the earth rejoices in a renewed
beauty, and in a redoubled plenty. - William Howitt, in "The Year-Book
of the Country," 1850.

[Psa 65:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#009)

"Thou visitest the earth." God seems to come with the coming-in of each
of the seasons. In some respects, during winter, God seems like a man
travelling into a far country. Darkness, and barrenness, and coldness,
suggest absence on the part of God. The spring looks like his return.
The great change it involves cheerily whispers, "He is not far from any
one of us." In longer days, and a warmer atmosphere, and a revived
earth, God comes to us. These things are not of necessity, but of
providence. There are second causes, but above all these is the First
Cause, intelligent, loving, and free, God rules in all, over all, and
above all. He is not displaced or supplanted by the forces and agencies
which he employs, he is not absorbed by care of other worlds, he is not
indifferent toward the earth. A personal superintendent and providence
are not beneath his dignity, or in anywise distasteful to him. As Maker,
and Life-giver, and Father, "Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it."
- Samuel Martin, in "Rain upon the Mown Grass, and other Sermons." 1871.

[Psa 65:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#009)

The Psalmist is here foretelling the gracious outpouring of the Holy
Spirit, and the conversion of the nations of the earth to Christ. -
Origen.

[Psa 65:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#009)

The chiefs of Hebrew theology attribute four keys to God, which he never
entrusted to any angel or seraph, and as the first of these they place
the key of rain. He himself is said, in [Job
28:26](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#026), to give a law to the rain, and
in [Job 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#008), to bind up the waters in
the clouds. - Thomas Le Blanc.

[Psa 65:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#009)

"With the river of God, which is full of water." That is, the clouds
figuratively described. - Edward Leigh (1602-3-1671)

[Psa 65:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#009)

"The river of God," as opposed to early streams. However these may fail,
the divine resources are exhaustless. - Joseph Addison Alexander.

[Psa 65:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#009)

"The river of God." The Chaldee paraphrase is, From the fountain of God
which is in the heavens, which is full of the rain-storms of blessing,
thou wilt prepare their cornfields. - Lorinus.

[Psa 65:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#009)

"Thou preparest their grain; for so dost thou prepare the earth."
\[Version of Am. Bib. Un.\] "So," namely, with this design, and for this
end. In the Hebrew, "for so dost thou prepare her;" referring to "the
earth," which in Hebrew is fern, while grain is masc. The meaning can be
expressed in English only by using the word (earth) which the Hebrew
pronoun represents. The English pronoun (it) would necessarily refer to
"grain," and would represent neither the meaning of the Hebrew nor its
form. - Thomas J. Conant.

[Psa 65:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#009)

"Thou preparest them corn," etc. Corn is the special gift of God to man.
There are several interesting and instructive ideas connected with this
view of it. All the other plants we use as food are unfit for this
purpose in their natural condition and require to have their nutritious
qualities developed, and their natures and forms to a certain extent
changed by a gradual process of cultivation. There is not a single
useful plant grown in our gardens and fields, but is utterly worthless
for food in its normal or wild state; and man has been left to himself
to find out, slowly and painfully, how to convert these crudities of
nature into nutritious vegetables. But it is not so with corn. It has
from the very beginning been an abnormal production. God gave it to
Adam, we have every reason to believe, in the same perfect state of
preparation for food in which we find it at the present day. It was made
expressly for man, and given directly into his hands. "Behold," says the
Creator, "I have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the
face of all the earth;" that is, all the cereal plants - such as corn,
wheat, barley, rice, maize, etc., whose peculiar characteristic it is to
produce seed....

There is another proof that corn was created for man's use, in the fact
that it has never been found in a wild state. The primitive types from
which all our other esculent plants were derived are still to be found
in a state of nature in this or other countries. The wild beet and
cabbage still grow on our sea-shores; the crab apple and the sloe, the
savage parents of our luscious pippins and plums, are still found among
the trees of the wood; but where are the original types of our corn
plants? Where are the wild grasses which, according to some authors, the
cumulative processes of agriculture, carried on through successive ages,
have developed into corn, wheat, and barley? Much has been written, and
many experiments have been tried, to determine the natural origin of
these cereals, but every effort has hitherto proved in vain. Reports
have again and again been circulated that corn and wheat have been found
growing wild in some parts of Persia and the steppes of Tartary,
apparently far from the influence of cultivation; but when tested by
botanical data, these reports have turned out, in every instance, to be
unfounded. Corn has never been known as anything else than a cultivated
plant.

History and observation probe that it cannot grow spontaneously. It is
never, like other plants, self-sown and self-diffused. Neglected of men,
it speedily disappears and becomes extinct. It does not return, as do
all other cultivated varieties of plants, to a natural condition; and so
become worthless as food, but utterly perishes, being constitutionally
unfitted to maintain the struggle for existence with the aboriginal
vegetation of the soil. All this proves that it must have been produced
miraculously; or, in other words, given by God to man directly, in the
same abnormal condition in which it now appears; for nature never could
have developed or preserved it. In the mythologies of all the ancient
nations it was confidently affirmed to have had a supernatural origin.
The Greeks and Romans believed it to be the gift of the goddess Ceres,
who taught her son, Triptolemus, to cultivate and distribute it over the
earth; and from her, the whole class of plants received the name of
cereals, which they now bear. And we only express the same truth when we
say to him, whom these pagans ignorantly worshipped, "Thou preparest
them corn, when thou hast so profited for it."

Let me bring forth one more proof of special design, enabling us to
recognise the hand of God in this mercy. Corn is universally diffused.
It is almost the only species of plant which is capable of growing
everywhere in almost every soil, in almost any situation. In some form
or other, adapted to the various modifications of climate and physical
conditions, which occur in different countries, it is spread over an
area of the earth's surface as extensive as the occupancy of the human
race...

Rice is grown in tropical countries where periodical rains and
inundations, followed by excessive heat, occur, and furnishes the chief
article of diet for the largest proportion of the human race. Wheat will
not thrive in hot climates, but flourishes all over the temperate zone,
at various ranges of elevation, and is admirably adapted to the wants of
highly civilised communities. Maize spreads over an immense geographical
area in the new world, where it has been known from time immemorial, and
formed a principal element of that Indian civilisation which surprised
the Spaniards in Mexico and Peru. Barley is cultivated in those parts of
Europe and Asia where the soil and climate are not adapted for wheat;
while oats and rye extend far into the black north, and disappear only
from those desolate Arctic regions where man cannot exist in his social
capacity. By these striking adaptations of different varieties of grain,
containing the same essential ingredients, to different soils and
climates, Providence has furnished the indispensable food for the
sustenance of the human race throughout the whole habitable globe and
all nations, and tribes, and tongues can rejoice together, as one great
family, with the joy of harvest. - Hugh Macmillan, in "Bible Teachings
in Nature." 1868.

[Psa 65:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#009)

I do not know any picture of rural life that in any measure comes up to
the exquisite description here brought before us, and which every one's
heart at once recognises as so true to nature in all its branches. In
the brief compass of five verses we have the whole scene vividly
sketched, from the first preparation of the earth or soil; the provision
of the corn-seed for the sower; the rain in its season, the former and
the latter rain, watering the ridges, settling the furrows, and causing
the seed to swell and to spring forth, and bud and bloom; then the
crowning of the whole year in the appointed weeks of harvest, and men's
hearts rejoicing before God according to the joy in harvest, the very
foot-paths dropping with fatness, and the valleys shouting and singing
for joy. Our harvest-homes are times of rejoicing too, but I would that
our tillers and reapers of the soil would as piously refer all to God as
the Psalmist did. "Thou waterest the earth, Thou greatly enrichest it,
Thou preparest the corn, Thou waterest the ridges, Thou settlest the
furrows, Thou makest it soft with showers, Thou blessest the springing
thereof, Thou crownest the year with thy goodness." Not one word of man,
of man's skill, or of man's labour, not one thought of self. How
different from him whose grounds brought forth abundantly, and whose
only thought was, "I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods
laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry." -
Barton Bouchier.

[Psa 65:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#010)

The rain hath a mollifying nature. When the earth is like iron under our
feet by long droughts or hard frosts, a few good showers supple it, and
make it tender. David, speaking of the earth, saith, "Thou makest it e,
aft with showers." Jesus Christ hath a softening virtue. Sometimes the
heart is hardened by the deceitfulness of sin ... If Christ would but
now drop a few drops from heaven, the veriest flint in the congregation
would be turned into a fountain of water ... The rain hath a fructifying
virtue. All the labour of the husbandman comes to nothing if either the
former or the latter rain be denied. The Psalmist sets out this virtue
of the rain in [Psa 65:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#009). Want of
rain brings a famine upon the earth ... If Christ do not rain, there
will be no fruits; but if Christ will drop down his dew, the pastures
will be green, All the labour and pains of the spiritual husbandman will
come to nothing if the rain come not down from Christ; and, if he please
to pour down showers, let not the eunuch say, "I am a dry tree." Though
your heart be as dry and withered as the rod of Aaron was, yet if Christ
will rain upon it, it shall both bud, and blossom, and bring forth
almonds.... The rain hath a recreating virtue. It causeth a gladness and
cheerfulness in the hearts of men, and it begets a kind of briskness in
the sensitive creatures: the birds chirp, the beasts of the field
rejoice in their kind; yea, there is a kind of Joy in the very inanimate
creatures. The Psalmist speaks of this: "The pastures are clothed with
flocks, the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy,
they also sing." When rain comes after a long drought, there is melody
made by all creatures in this lower world. Jesus Christ hath a cheering
virtue; he doth fill the soul with joy when he comes down into the soul;
the heart that was dead, and dull, and heavy is made pleasant and joyful
when these showers fall upon it. When Jesus Christ comes to the soul, he
brings Joy to the soul: They Joy before thee according to the joy in
harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil. [Isa
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#003). - Ralph Robinson.

[Psa 65:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#010)

Thou art the right Master-cultivator, who cultivates the land much more
and much better than the farmer does. He does nothing more to it than
break up the ground, and plough, and sow, and then lets it lie. But God
must be always attending to it with rain and heat, and must do
everything to make it grow and prosper while the farmer lies at home and
sleeps. - Martin Luther.

[Psa 65:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#011)

"Thou crownest the year with thy goodness." Dr. William Whewell, in his
Bridgewater Treatise, notes the evidence of design in the length of the
year, aria although it may not perhaps be considered to be a direct
comment on the text, I beg to quote it here, as it may awaken a train of
thought, and make more conspicuous the goodness of God, in the
revolution of the seasons. "If any change in the length of the year were
to take place, the working of the botanical world would be thrown into
utter disorder, the functions of plants would be entirely deranged, and
the whole vegetable kingdom involved in instant decay and rapid
extinction. That this would be the case, may be collected from
innumerable indications. Most of our fruit trees, for example, require
the year to be of its present length. If the summer and the 'autumn were
much shorter, the fruit could not ripen; if these seasons were much
longer, the tree would put forth a fresh suit of blossoms, to be cut
down by the winter. Or, if the year were twice its present length, a
second crop of fruit would probably not be matured, for want, among
other things, of an immediate season of rest and consolidation, such as
the winter is, our forest trees, in like manner, appear to need all the
seasons of our present year for their perfection; the spring, summer,
and autumn, for the development of their leaves and consequent formation
of their proper juice, and of wood from this; and the winter for the
hardening and solidifying the substance thus formed ... The processes of
the rising of the sap, of the formation of proper juices, of the
unfolding of leaves, the opening of flowers, the fecundation of the
fruit, the ripening of the seed, its proper deposition in order for the
reproduction of a new plant; all these operations require a certain
portion of time, and could not be compressed into a space less than a
year, or at least could not be abbreviated in any very great degree.
And, on the other hand, if the winter were greatly longer than it now
is, many seeds would not germinate at the return of spring. Seeds which
have been kept too long, require stimulants to make them fertile. If,
therefore, the duration of the seasons were much to change, the
processes of vegetable Me would be interrupted, deranged, distempered.
What, for instance, would become of our calendar of Flora, if the year
were lengthened or shortened by six months? Some of the dates would
never arrive in the one case, and the vegetable processes which mark
them would be superseded; some seasons would be without dates in the
other case, and these periods would be employed in a way hurtful to the
plants, and no doubt speedily destructive. We should have, not only a
year of confusion, but, if it were repeated and continued, a year of
death ... The same kind of argument might be applied to the animal
creation. The pairing, nesting, hatching, fledging, and flight of birds,
for instance, occupy each its peculiar time of the year; and, together
with a proper period of rest, fill up the twelve months; the
transformations of most insects have a similar reference to the seasons,
their progress and duration. 'In every species' (except man's), says a
writer on animals, 'there is a particular period of the year in which
the reproductive system exercises its energies. And the season of love
and the period of gestation are so arranged that the young ones are
produced at the time wherein the conditions of temperature are most
suited to the commencement of life.' It is not our business here to
consider the details of such provisions, beautiful and striking as they
are. But the prevalence of the great law of periodicity in the vital
functions of organised beings will be allowed to have a claim to be
considered in its reference to astronomy, when it is seen that their
periodical constitution derives its use from the periodical nature of
the motions of the planets round the sun; and that the duration of such
cycles in the existence of plants and animals has a reference to the
arbitrary elements of the solar system, a reference which, we maintain,
is inexplicable and unintelligible, except by admitting into our
conceptions an intelligent Author, alike of the organic and inorganic
universe."

[Psa 65:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#011)

"Thou crownest the year with thy goodness." God has surrounded this year
with his goodness, "compassed and enclosed it" on every side. So we
translate the same word, ([Psa 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#012))
"With favour wilt thou compass (or crown) him as with a shield." He has
given us instances of his goodness in every thing that condemns us; so
that turn which way we will, we meet with the tokens of his favour;
every part of the year has been enriched with the blessings of heaven,
and no gap has been left open for any desolating judgment to enter by. -
Matthew Henry.

[Psa 65:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#011)

"Thou crownest the year." A full and plentiful harvest is the crown of
the year; and this springs from the unmerited goodness of God. This is
the diadem of the earth. עטּרתּ ittarta, "Thou encirclest," as with a
diadem. A most elegant expression, to show the progress of the sun
through the twelve signs of the zodiac, producing the seasons, and
giving a sufficiency of light and heat alternately, to all places on the
surface of the globe, by its north and south declination (amounting to
23 28' at the solstices) on each side of the equator. A more beautiful
image could not have been chosen; and the very appearance of the space,
termed the zodiac on a celestial globe, shows with what propriety the
idea of a circle or diadem was conceived by this inimitable poet. - Adam
Clarke.

[Psa 65:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#011)

"Thou crownest." The herbs, fruits, and flowers, produced by the earth,
are here finely represented as a beautiful-variegated crown, set upon
her head, by the hands of the great Creator. - Samuel Burder.

[Psa 65:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#011)

To crown the year of goodness, is to raise it to the highest degree and
summit of prosperity, happiness and glory. To crown, to fill up, to make
glorious and joyful: the year of the goodness of God is the time in
which he unfolds his own highest goodness; one is crowned, when the
effects of this goodness are displayed on the grandest scale, and bring
great glory and joy, Such was the time when he shone forth, and the
clouds dropped fatness, and all parts of the earth were filled with
fertility.... The paths of God are the clouds, before called the river
of God: (see [Psa 104:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#003)), now the
paths in which God himself seems to move, and whence, from the 'place'
of rain, from the river of God, flows fatness itself, or: the copious
abundance of all that is sweetest and best. - Hermann Venema.

[Psa 65:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#011)

"Thy paths-drop fatness." When the conqueror journeys through: the
nations, his paths drop blood; fire and vapour of smoke are in his
track, and tears, and groans, and sighs attend him. But where the Lord
journeys, his "paths drop fatness." When the kings of old made a
progress through their dominions; they caused a famine wherever they
tarried; for the greedy courtiers who swarmed in their camp devoured all
things like locusts, and were as greedily ravenous as palmer-worms and
caterpillars. But where the great King of kings journeys, he enriches
the land'; his "paths drop fatness." By a bold Hebrew metaphor the
clouds: are represented as the chariots of God: "He maketh the clouds
his chariot;" and as the Lord Jehovah rides-upon the heavens in the
greatness of his strength, and in his excellency on the sky, the rains
drop down upon the lands, and so the wheel-tracks of Jehovah are marked
by the fatness which makes glad the earth. Happy, happy are the people
who worship such a God, whose coming is ever a coming of goodness and of
grace to his creatures. - C. H. S.

[Psa 65:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#011)

"Paths" here are properly such tracks as are made by chariot wheels. -
Henry Ainsworth.

[Psa 65:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#012)

"The wilderness." By desert, or wilderness, the reader is not always to
understand a country altogether barren and unfruitful, but such only as
is rarely or never sown or cultivated; which, though it yields no crops
of corn or fruit, yet affords herbage more or less: for the grazing of
cattle, with fountains or rills of water, though more sparingly
interspersed than in other places. - Thomas Shaw (1692-1751).

[Psa 65:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#013)

The phrase, "the pastures are clothed with flocks," cannot be regarded
as the vulgar language of poetry. It appears peculiarly beautiful and
appropriate, when we consider the 'numerous flocks which whitened the
plains of Syria and Canaan. In the eastern countries, sheep are much
more prolific than with us, and they derive their name from their great
fruitfulness; bringing forth, as they are said to do, "thousands and ten
thousands in their streets," [Psa
144:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#013). They, therefore, formed no
mean part of the wealth of the East. - James Anderson, in editorial Note
to Calvin in loc.

[Psa 65:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#013)

The hills, where not tilled, Were bushy and green, and sprinkled with
numerous flocks; the valleys broad and covered with a rich crop of
wheat; the fields full of reapers and gleaners in the midst of the
harvest, with asses and camels receiving 'their loads of sheaves, and
feeding unmuzzled and undisturbed upon the ripe grain. - Edward
Robinson.

[Psa 65:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#013)

It may seem strange, that he should first tell us, that "they shout for
joy," and then add the feebler expression, that "they sing;"
interposing, too, the intensative particle, אף aph, they shout for joy,
Yea, they also sing. The verb, however; admits of being taken in the
future tense, they shall sing; and this denotes a continuation of joy,
that they would rejoice, not only one year, but through the endless
succession of the seasons. I may add, what is well-known, that in Hebrew
the order of expression is frequently inverted in this way. - John
Calvin.

[Psa 65:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#013)

"They also sing." They ardently sing: such is the real meaning of אף;
primarily "heat" or "warmth," thence "ardour, passion, anger," and
thence again "the nostrils," as the supposed seat of this feeling. -
John Mason Good.

[Psalms 65:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 65:1</span></span>

1 Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow
be performed.

2 O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.

3 Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, thou shalt
purge them away.

4 Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto
thee, that he may dwell in thy courts - we shall be satisfied with the
goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple.

[Psa 65:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001)

"Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion." Though Babylon adores
Antichrist, Zion remains faithful to her King; to him, and to him only,
she brings her perpetual oblation of worship. Those who have seen in
Zion the blood of sprinkling, and know themselves to belong to the
church of the firstborn, can never think of her without presenting
humble praise to Zion's God; his mercies are too numerous and precious
to be forgotten. The praises of the saints wait for a signal from the
divine Lord, and when he shows his face they burst forth at once. Like a
company of musicians gathered to welcome and honour a prince, who wait
till he makes his appearance, so do we reserve our best praises till the
Lord reveals himself in the assembly of his saints; and, indeed, till he
shall descend from heaven in the day of his appearing. Praise also waits
like a servant or courtier in the royal halls - gratitude is humble and
obedient. Praise attends the Lord's pleasure, and continues to bless
him, whether he shows tokens of present favour or no; she is not soon
wearied, but all through the night she sings on in sure hope that the
morning cometh. We shall continue to wait on, tuning our harps, amid the
tears of earth; but O what harmonies will those be which we will pour
forth, when the home-bringing is come, and the King shall appear in his
glory. The passage may be rendered "praise is silent for thee;" it is
calm, peaceful, and ready to adore thee in quietness. Or, it may mean,
our praise is but silence compared with thy deservings, O God. Or, in
solemn silence we worship thee, because our praise cannot be uttered;
accept, therefore, our silence as praise. Or, we are so engrossed in thy
praise, that to all other things we are dumb; we have no tongue for
anything but thee. Perhaps the poet best expressed the thought of the
Psalmist when he said -

"A sacred reverence checks our songs,

And praise sits silent on our tongues."

Certainly, when the soul is most filled with adoring awe, she is least
content with her own expressions, and feels most deeply how inadequate
are all mortal songs to proclaim the divine goodness. A church, bowed
into silent adoration by a profound sense of divine mercy, would
certainly offer more real praise than the sweetest voices aided by pipes
and strings; yet, vocal music is not to be neglected, for this sacred
hymn was meant to be sung. It is well before singing to have the soul
placed in a waiting attitude, and to be humbly conscious that our best
praise is but silence compared with Jehovah's glory.

"And unto thee shall the vow be performed." Perhaps a special vow made
during a season of drought and political danger. Nations and churches
must be honest and prompt in redeeming their promises to the Lord, who
cannot be mocked with impunity. So, too, must individuals. We are not to
forget our vows, or to redeem them to be seen of men - unto God alone
must they be performed, with a single eye to his acceptance. Believers
are all under covenant, which they made at conversion, and have renewed
upon being baptised, joining the church, and coming to the table, and
some of them are under special pledges which they entered into under
peculiar circumstances; these are to be piously and punctually
fulfilled. We ought to be very deliberate in promising, and very
punctilious in performing. A vow unkept will burn the conscience like a
hot iron. Vows of service, of donation, of praise, or whatever they may
be, are no trifles; and in the day of grateful praise they should,
without fail, be fulfilled to the utmost of our power.

[Psa 65:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#002)

"O thou that hearest prayer." This is thy name, thy nature, thy glory.
God not only has heard, but is now hearing prayer, and always must hear
prayer, since he is an immutable being, and never changes in his
attributes. What a delightful title for the God and Father of our Lord
Jesus Christi Every right and sincere prayer is as surely heard as it is
offered. Here the Psalmist brings in the personal pronoun "thou," and we
beg the reader to notice how often "thou, thee," and "thy," occur in
this hymn; David evidently believed in a personal God, and did not adore
a mere idea or abstraction. "Unto thee shall all flesh come." This shall
encourage men of all nations to become suppliants to the one and only
God, who proves his Deity by answering those who seek his face. Flesh
they are, and therefore weak; frail and sinful, they need to pray; and
thou art such a God as they need, for thou art touched with compassion,
and dost condescend to hear the cries of poor flesh and blood. Many come
to thee now in humble faith, and are filled with good, but more shall be
drawn to thee by the attractiveness of thy love, and at length the whole
earth shall bow at thy feet. To come to God is the life of true
religion; we come weeping in conversion, hoping in supplication,
rejoicing in praise, and delighting in service. False gods must in due
time lose their deluded votaries, for man when enlightened will not be
longer be fooled; but each one who tries the true God is encouraged by
his own success to persuade others also, and so the kingdom of God comes
to men, and men come to it.

[Psa 65:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#003)

"Iniquities prevail against me." Others accuse and slander me, and in
addition my own sins rise up and would beset me to my confusion, were it
not for the remembrance of the atonement which covers every one of my
iniquities. Our sins would, but for grace, prevail against us in the
court of divine justice, in the court of conscience, and in the battle
of life. Unhappy is the man who despises these enemies, and worse still
is he who counts them his friends! He is best instructed who knows their
deadly power, and flees for refuge to him who pardons iniquity. "As for
our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away." Thou dost cover them
all, for thou hast provided a covering propitiation, a mercy-seat which
wholly covers thy law. Note the word "our," the faith of the one
penitent who speaks for himself in the first clause, here embraces all
the faithful in Zion; and he is so persuaded of the largeness of
forgiving love that he leads all the saints to sing of the blessing.
What a comfort that iniquities which prevail against us, do not prevail
against God. They would keep us away from God, but he sweeps them away
from before himself and us; they are too strong for us, but not for our
Redeemer, who is mighty, yea, and almighty to save. It is worthy of note
that as the priest washed in the laver before he sacrificed, so David
leads us to obtain purification from sin before we enter upon the
service of song. When we have washed our robes and made them white in
his blood, then shall we acceptably sing, "Worthy is the Lamb that was
slain."

[Psa 65:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#004)

"Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto
thee." After cleansing comes benediction, and truly this is a very rich
one. It comprehends both election, effectual calling, access,
acceptance, and sonship. First, we are chosen of God, according to the
good pleasure of his will, and this alone is blessedness. Then, since we
cannot and will not come to God of ourselves, he works graciously in us,
and attracts us powerfully; he subdues our unwillingness, and removes
our inability by the almighty workings of his transforming grace. This
also is no slight blessedness. Furthermore, we, by his divine drawings,
are made nigh by the blood of his Son, and brought near by his Spirit,
into intimate fellowship; so that we have access with boldness, and are
no longer as those who are afar off by wicked works: here also is
unrivalled blessedness. To crown all, we do not come nigh in peril of
dire destruction, as Nadab and Abihu did, but we approach as chosen and
accepted ones, to become dwellers in the divine household: this is
heaped-up blessedness, vast beyond conception. But dwelling in the house
we are treated as sons, for the servant abideth not in the house for
ever, but the son abideth ever. Behold what manner of love and
blessedness the Father has bestowed upon us that we may dwell in his
house, and go no more out for ever. Happy men who dwell at home with
God. May both writer and reader be such men. "That he may dwell in thy
courts." Acceptance leads to abiding: God does not make a temporary
choice, or give and take; his gifts and calling are without repentance.
He who is once admitted to God's courts shall inhabit them for ever; he
shall be

"No more a stranger or a guest,

But like a child at home."

Permanence gives preciousness. Terminating blessings are but
half-blessings. To dwell in the courts of the Great King is to be
ennobled; to dwell there for ever is to be emparadised: yet such is the
portion of every man whom God has chosen and caused to approach unto
him, though once his iniquities prevailed against him.

[Psalms 65:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 65:5</span></span>

5 By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our
salvation; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of
them that are afar off upon the sea:

6 Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girded with
power:

7 Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and
the tumult of the people.

8 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens:
thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.

[Psa 65:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#005)

"By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our
salvation." God's memorial is that he hears prayer, and his glory is
that he answers it in a manner fitted to inspire awe in the hearts of
his people. The saints, in the commencement of the Psalm, offered praise
in reverential silence; and now, in the like awe-stricken spirit, they
receive answers to their prayers. The direct allusion here is, no doubt,
to the Lord's overthrow of the enemies of his people in ways calculated
to strike terror into all beholders; his judgments in their severe
righteousness were calculated to excite fear both among friends and
foes. Who would not fear a God whose blows are so crushing? We do not
always know what we are asking for when we pray; when the answer comes,
the veritable answer, it is possible that we may be terrified by it. We
seek sanctification, and trial will be the reply: we ask for more faith,
and more affliction is the result: we pray for the spread of the gospel,
and persecution scatters Us. Nevertheless, it is good to ask on, for
nothing which the Lord grants in his love can do us any harm. Terrible
things will turn out to be blessed things after all, when they come in
answer to prayer.

See in this verse how righteousness and salvation are united, the
terrible things with the gracious answers. Where but in Jesus could they
be blended? The God who saves may answer our prayers in a way which puts
unbelief into a flutter; but when faith spies the Saviour, she remembers
that "things are not what they seem," and she is of good courage. He who
is terrible is also our refuge from terror when we see him in the
Well-beloved. "Who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth." The
dwellers in the far-off isles trust in God; those most remote from Zion
yet confide in the ever living Jehovah. Even those who dwell in
countries, frozen or torrid, where nature puts on her varied terrors,
and those who see dread wonders on the deep, yet fly from the terrors of
God and place their confidence in the God of terrors. His arm is strong
to smite, but also strong to save. "And of them that are afar off upon
the sea." Both elements have their elect bands of believers. If the land
gave Moses elders, the sea gave Jesus apostles. Noah, when all was
ocean, was as calm with God as Abraham in his tent. All men are equally
dependent upon God: the seafaring man is usually most conscious of this,
but in reality he is not more so than the husbandman, nor the husbandman
than anyone else. There is no room for self-confidence on land or sea,
since God is the only true confidence of men on earth or ocean. Faith is
a plant of universal growth, it is a tree of life on shore and a plant
of renown at sea; and, blessed be God, those Who exercise faith in him
anywhere shall find that he is swift and strong to answer their prayers.
A remembrance of this should quicken our devotions when we approach unto
the Lord our God.

[Psa 65:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#006)

"Which by his strength setteth last the mountains." He, as it were,
fixed them in their sockets, and preserved them from falling by
earthquake or storm. The firmest owe their stability to him.
Philosophers of the forget-God school are too much engrossed with their
laws of upheaval to think of the Upheaver. Their theories of volcanic
action and glacier action, etc., etc., are frequently used as bolts and
bars to shut the Lord out of his own world. Our poet is of another mind,
and sees God's hand settling Alps and Andes on their bases, and
therefore he sings in his praise. Let me for ever be just such an
unphilosophic simpleton as David was, for he was nearer akin to Solomon
than any of our modern theorists. "Being girded with power." The Lord is
so himself, and he therefore casts a girdle of strength around the
hills, and there they stand, braced, belted, and bulwarked with his
might. The poetry is such as would naturally suggest itself to one
familiar with mountain scenery; power everywhere meets you, sublimity,
massive grandeur, and stupendous force are all around you; and God is
there, the author and source of all.

Let us learn that we poor puny ones, if we wish for true establishment,
must go to the strong for strength. Without him, the everlasting hills
would crumble; how much more shall all our plans, projects, and labours
come to decay. Repose, O believer, where the mountains find their bases
- viz., in the undiminished might of the Lord God.

[Psa 65:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#007)

"Which stilleth the noise of the seas." His soft breath smooths the sea
into a glass, and the mountainous waves into ripples. God does this.
Calms are of the God of peace; it needs not that we look for a hurricane
when it is said that he cometh. He walked of old in the garden in the
cool of the day; he is resting even now, for his great seventh day is
not yet over, and he is always "the Lord and giver of peace." Let
mariners magnify the God who rules the waves. "The noise of their
waves." Each separate brawler amid the riot of the storm is quieted by
the divine voice. "And the tumult of the people." Nations are as
difficult to rule as the sea itself, they are as fitful, treacherous,
restless, and furious; they will not brook the bridle nor be restrained
by laws. Canute had not a more perilous sea by the rising billows than
many a king and emperor has had when the multitude have been set on
mischief, and have grown weary of their lords. God alone is King of
nations. The sea obeys him, and the yet more tumultuous nations are kept
in check by him. Human society owes its preservation to the continued
power of God: evil passions would secure its instant dissolution; envy,
ambition, and cruelty would create anarchy tomorrow, if God did not
prevent; whereof we have had clear proof in the various French
revolutions, Glory be unto God who maintains the fabric of social order,
and checks the wicked, who would fain overthrow all things. The child of
God in seasons of trouble should fly at once to him who stills the seas:
nothing is too hard for him.

[Psa 65:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#008)

"They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens."
Signs of God's presence are not few, nor confined to any one region.
Zembla sees them as well as Zion, and Terra del Fuego as surely as the
Terra Sacra. These tokens are sometimes terrible phenomena in nature -
such as earthquake, pestilence, tornado, or storm; and when these are
seen, even the most barbarous people tremble before God. At other times
they are dread works of providences such as the overthrow of Sodom, and
the destruction of Pharaoh. The rumour of these judgments travels to
earth's utmost verge, and impresses all people with a fear and trembling
at such a just and holy God. We bless God that we are not afraid but
rejoice at his tokens: with solemn awe we are glad when we behold his
mighty acts. We fear, but not with slavish fear. "Thou makest the
outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice." East and west are made
happy by God's favour to the dwellers therein. Our rising hours are
bright with hope, and our evening moments mellow with thanksgiving.
Whether the sun go forth or come in we bless God and rejoice in the
gates of the day. When the fair morning blushes with the rosy dawn we
rejoice; and when the calm evening smiles restfully we rejoice still. We
do not believe that the dew weeps the death of the day; we only see
jewels bequeathed by the departing day for its successor to gather up
from the earth. Faith, when she sees God, rounds the day with joy. She
cannot fast, because the bridegroom is with her. Night and day are alike
to her, for the same God made them and blessed them. She would have no
rejoicing if God did not make her glad; but, blessed be his name, he
never ceases to make joy for those who find their joy in him.

[Psalms 65:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 65:9</span></span>

9 Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it
with the river of God, which is full of water: thou preparest them corn,
when thou hast so provided for it.

10 Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the
furrows thereof thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the
springing thereof.

11 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop fatness.

12 They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness; and the little hills
rejoice on every side.

13 The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered
over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.

[Psa 65:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#009)

"Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it." God's visits leave a
blessing behind; this is more than can be said of every visitor. When
the Lord goes on visitations of mercy, he has abundance of necessary
things for all his needy creatures. He is represented here as going
round the earth, as a gardener surveys his garden, and as giving water
to every plant that requires it, and that not in small quantities, but
until the earth is drenched and soaked with a rich supply of
refreshment. O Lord, in this manner visit thy church, and my poor,
parched, and withering piety. Make thy grace to overflow towards my
graces; water me, for no plant of thy garden needs it more.

"My stock lies dead, and no increase

Doth my dull husbandry improve;

O let thy graces without cease

Drop from above."

"Thou greatly enrichest it." Millions of money could not so much enrich
mankind as the showers do. The soil is made rich by the rain, and then
yields its riches to man; but God is the first giver of all. How truly
rich are those who are enriched with grace; this is great riches. "With
the river of God, which is full of water." The brooks of earth are soon
dried up, and all human resources, being finite, are liable to failure;
but God's provision for the supply of rain is inexhaustible; there is no
bottom or shore to his river. The deluge poured from the clouds
yesterday may be succeeded by another tomorrow, and yet the waters above
the firmament shall not fail. How true is this in the realm of grace;
there "the river of God is full of water," and "of his fulness have all
we received, and grace for grace." The ancients in their fables spake of
Pactolus, which flowed over sands of gold; but this river of God, which
flows above and from which the rain is poured, is far more enriching;
for, after all, the wealth of men lies mainly in the harvest of their
fields, without which even gold would be of no value whatever. "Thou
preparest them corn." Corn is specially set apart to be the food of man.
In its various species it is a divine provision for the nutriment of our
race, and is truly called the staff of life. We hear in commerce of
"prepared corn-flour" but God prepared it long before man touched it. As
surely as the manna was prepared of God for the tribes, so certainly is
corn made and sent by God for our daily use. What is the difference
whether we gather wheat-ears or manna, and what matters it if the first
comes upward to us and the second downward? God is as much present
beneath as above; it is as great a marvel that food should rise out of
the dust, as that it should fall from the skies. "When thou hast so
provided for it." When all is prepared to produce corn, the Lord puts
the finishing stroke, and the grain is forthcoming; not even, when all
the material is prepared, will the wheat be perfected without the
continuous and perfecting operation of the Most High. Blessed be the
Great Householder; he does not suffer the harvest to fail, he supplies
the teeming myriads of earth with bread enough from year to year. Even
thus does he vouchsafe heavenly food to his redeemed ones: "He hath
given meat unto them that fear him; he is ever mindful of his covenant."

[Psa 65:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#010)

"Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrows
thereof." Ridge and furrow are drenched. The ridges beaten down and
settled, and the furrows made to stand like gutters flooded to the full.
"Thou makest it soft with showers." The drought turned the clods into
iron, but the plenteous showers dissolve and loosen the soil. "Thou
blessest the springing thereof." Vegetation enlivened by the moisture
leaps into rigour, the seed germinates and sends forth its green shoot,
and the smell is that of a field which the Lord has blessed. All this
may furnish us with a figure of the operations of the Holy Spirit in
beating down high thoughts, filling our lowly desires, softening the
soul, and causing every holy thing to increase and spread.

[Psa 65:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#011)

"Thou crownest the year with thy goodness." The harvest is the plainest
display of the divine bounty, and the crown of the year. The Lord
himself conducts the coronation, and sets the golden coronal upon the
brow of the year. Or, we may understand the expression to mean that
God's love encircles the year as with a crown; each month has its gems,
each day its pearl. Unceasing kindness girdles all time with a belt of
love. The providence of God in its visitations makes a complete circuit,
and surrounds the year. "And thy paths drop fatness." The footsteps of
God, when he visits the land with rain, create fertility. It was said of
the Tartar hordes, that grass grew no more where their horses' feet had
trodden; so, on the contrary, it may be said that the march of Jehovah,
the Fertiliser, may be traced by the abundance which he creates, For
spiritual harvests we must look to him, for he alone can give "times of
refreshing" and feasts of Pentecost.

[Psa 65:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#012)

"They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness." Not alone where man is
found do the showers descend, but away in the lone places, where only
wild animals have their haunt, there the bountiful Lord makes the
refreshing rain to drop. Ten thousand oases smile while the Lord of
mercy passes by. The birds of the air, the wild goats, and the fleet
stags rejoice as they drink from the pools, new filled from heaven. The
most lonely and solitary souls God will visit in love. "And the little
hills rejoice on every side." On all hands the eminences are girt with
gladness. Soon they languish under the effects of drought, but after a
season of rain they laugh again with verdure.

[Psa 65:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#013)

"The pastures are clothed with flocks." The clothing of man first
clothes the fields. Pastures appear to be quite covered with numerous
flocks when the grass is abundant. "The valleys also are covered over
with corn." The arable as well as the pasture land is rendered fruitful.
God's clouds, like ravens, bring us both bread and flesh. Grazing flocks
and waving crops are equally the gifts of the Preserver of men, and for
both praise should be rendered. Sheep-shearing and harvest should both
be holiness unto the Lord. "They shout for joy." The bounty of God makes
the earth vocal with his praise, and in opened ears it lifts up a joyous
shout. The cattle low out the divine praises, and the rustling ears of
grain sing a soft sweet melody unto the Lord.

"Ye forests bend, ye harvests wave to him;

Breathe your still song into the reaper's heart,

As home he goes beneath the joyous moon.

Bleat out afresh ye hills; ye mossy rocks

Retain the sound; the broad responsive low

Ye valleys raise; for the Great Shepherd reigns,

And his unsuffering kingdom yet will come."

"They also sing." The voice of nature is articulate to God; it is not
only a shout, but a song. Well ordered are the sounds of animate
creation as they combine with the equally well-tuned ripple of the
waters, and sighings of the wind. Nature has no discords. Her airs are
melodious, her chorus is full of harmony. All, all is for the Lord; the
world is a hymn to the Eternal blessed is he who, hearing, joins in it,
and makes one singer in the mighty chorus.
