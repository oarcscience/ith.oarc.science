### [Psalms Chapter 64](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 64:0</span></span>

Title. - To the chief Musician. The leader of the choir, for the
time-being, is charged with this song. It were well if the chief
musicians of all our congregations estimated their duty at its due
solemnity, for it is no mean thing to be called to lead the sacred song
of God's people, and the responsibility is by no means light.

A Psalm of David. - His life was one of conflict, and very seldom does
he finish a Psalm without mentioning his enemies; in this instance his
thoughts are wholly occupied with prayer against them.

Division. - From [Psa 64:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#001.md) he
describes the cruelty and craftiness of his foes, and from [Psa
64:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#007.md) he prophesies their overthrow.

excellent topic in reference both to the sinner and to professed saints.

[Psa 64:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#003.md). - The whetting of the
tongue. Fresh faults discovered, evil motives imputed, exaggerations
invented, lies forged, inuendoes suggested, old slanders furbished, and
ancient hatreds rekindled.

[Psa 64:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#005.md). - The mutual encouragements
of sinners a rebuke to professors who dishearten each other.

[Psa 64:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#006) (two first clauses.md). - The

II\. Its effect upon men in general: "All men shall fear, and shall
declare," etc.

III\. A special duty resulting from it, incumbent on good men: "The
righteous," etc. - H. Dove.

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Whole Psalm

This Psalm is applied by R. Obadiah to Haman and Moredecai. The enemy is
Haman, the perfect man shot at is Mordecai; about whom Haman communed
with his friends to lay snares for him, and search diligently for
occasions against him and his people, which issued in his own
destruction. The ancient Midrash of the Jews applies it to Daniel, when
cast into the den of lions; and Jarchi supposes that David, by a spirit
of prophecy, foresaw it, and prayed for him who was of his seed; and
that everything in the Psalm beautifully falls in with that man aimed
at; the enemy are the princes of Darius's account. Daniel is the perfect
man aimed at; the enemy are the princes of Darius's court, who consulted
against him, communed of laying snares for him, and gained their point,
which proved their own ruin. But the Psalm literally belongs to David,
by whom it was composed. - John Gill.

Whole Psalm

A cry of God's elect, when persecuted for righteousness sake, to their
Deliverer and sure Avenger. The general principle stated is very clear.
The Psalm will adjust itself, as an experimental utterance, to the lips
of Christian faith whenever brought into contact with the evil forces of
the prince of this world, so as to suffer affliction for the gospel's
sake; for it expresses the condition and the hope of one actually
imperilled for the truth. How aptly a portion of this Psalm applies to
the suffering Truth Himself in the days of his affliction, when, pierced
in his spirit by lying words, he endured the contradiction of sinners
against himself, needs not be pointed out. - Arthur Pridham, in "Notes
and Reflections on the Psalms," 1869.

[Psa 64:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#001.md)

"Preserve my life." Hebrew, lives; so called for the many faculties,
operations, revolutions, and commodities of life. - John Trapp.

[Psa 64:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#003.md)

"Who whet their tongue," etc. The verb means, says Parkhurst, "to whet,
sharpen," which is performed by reiterated motion or friction; and by a
beautiful metaphor it is applied to a wicked tongue. It has, however,
been rendered, "vibrate," as it is certain a serpent does his tongue. -
Richard Mant.

[Psa 64:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#003.md)

The ingenuity of man has been wonderfully tasked and exercised in two
things, inventing destructive weapons of war, and devising, various
methods of ruining men by wicked words. The list of the former is found
in military writings. But the various forms of evil speaking can hardly
be catalogued. Evil speakers have arrows, sharp, barbed, dipped in
poison. They have "swords, flaming, swords, two-edged swords, drawn
swords, drawn in anger, with which they cut, and wound, and kill the
good name of their neighbor." Sins of the tongue are commonly very
cruel. When slander is secret, as it commonly is, you cannot defend
yourself from its assaults. Its canons are infernal. One of them is, "If
a lie will do better than the truth, tell a lie." Another is, "Heap on
reproach; some of it will stick." - William S. Plainer.

[Psa 64:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#003.md), [Psa
64:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#004.md)

We saw in the Museum at Venice an instrument with which one of the old
Italian tyrants was accustomed to shoot poisoned needles at the objects
of his wanton malignity. We thought of gossips, backbiters, and secret
slanderers, and wished that their mischievous devices might come to a
speedy end. Their weapons of inuendo, shrug, and whisper, appear to be
as insignificant as needles; but the venom which they instil is deadly
to many a reputation. - C. H. Spurgeon, in "Feathers for Arrows; or,
Illustrations for Preachers and Teachers."

[Psa 64:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#003.md), [Psa
64:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#004.md)

David, upon sad experience, compareth a wicked, reviling tongue to three
fatal weapons - a razor, a sword, and an arrow. To a razor, such a one
as will take off every little hair: so a reviling tongue will not only
take advantage of every gross sin committed by others, but those
peccadilloes, the least infirmities which others better qualified cannot
so much as discern; secondly, to a Sword that wounds: so the tongues of
reproaching men cut deeply into the credits and reputations of their
brethren, but a sword doth mischief only near hand, not afar off; and,
therefore, it is in the third place compared to an arrow, that can hit
at a distance: and so revilers do not ill offices to those only in the
parish or town where they live, but to others far remote. How much,
then, doth it concern every man to walk circumspectly; to give no just
cause of reproach, not to make himself a scorn to the fools of the
world; but, if they will reproach (as certainly they will), let it be
for forwardness in God's ways, and not for sin, that so the reproach may
fall upon their own heads, and their scandalous language into their own
throats. - Jeremiah Burroughs.

[Psa 64:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#003.md), [Psa
64:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#007.md), [Psa
64:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#008.md)

The most mischievous weapons of the wicked are words, "even bitter
words;" but the Word is the chief weapon of the Holy Spirit: and as with
this sword the great Captain foiled the tempter in the wilderness, so
may we vanquish "the workers of iniquity" with the true Jerusalem blade.
- J. L. K.

[Psa 64:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#004.md)

"That they may shoot in secret." The wicked are said to shoot their
arrows in secret at the perfect; and then "they say, Who shall see
them?"

[Psa 64:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#005.md)

Thus Satan lets fly a temptation so secretly, that he is hardly
suspected in the thing. Sometimes he useth a wife's tongue to do his
errand; another while he gets behind the back of a husband, friend,
servant, etc., and is not seen all the while he is doing his work. Who
would have thought to have found a devil in Peter, tempting his Master,
or suspected that Abraham should be his instrument to betray his beloved
wife into the hands of a sin? yet it was so. Nay, sometimes he is so
secret, that he borrows God's bow to shoot his arrows from, and the poor
Christian is abused, thinking it is God chides and is angry, when it is
the devil tempts him to think so, and only counterfeits God's voice. -
William Gurnall.

[Psa 64:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#006.md)

"They search out iniquities," etc. It is a sign that malice boils up to
a great height in men's hearts, when they are so active to find matter
against their neighbours. Love would rather not see or hear of others'
failings; or if it doth and must, busieth itself in healing and
reforming them to the utmost of its power. - John Milward ( - 1684), in
"Morning Exercises."

[Psa 64:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#007.md)

"With an arrow suddenly." As was Ahab, and the rich fool (Luke 12.):
while he sat pruning himself like a bird on a bough, death fetched him
off suddenly by his shaft, shot at him, and down he came tumbling. See
[Th1 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#003.md). - John Trapp.

[Psa 64:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#008) (first clause.md)

In these cases,

We still have judgment here, that we but teach

Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return

To plague the inventor: This even-handed justice

Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice

To our own lips.

William Shakespeare.

[Psa 64:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#008.md)

"Their own tongue to fall upon themselves." That is, their own words
shall be brought as a testimony against them, and condemn them. "The
tongue is a little member" (saith the apostle James, [Jam
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#005).md), and therefore a light member;
yet it falls heavy, as heavy as lead. A man were better have his house
fall upon him, than that, in this sense, his tongue should fall upon
him. Some have been pressed to death because they would not speak, but
stood mute before the judge; but more have been pressed to death by
their sinful freedom, or rather licentiousness in speaking; this hath
brought them to judgment, and cast them in judgment ... A Strange thing
that the fall of a man's tongue should oppress his body and whole
estate; yet so it is, the weight of a man's tongue falling upon him
crushes him to powder. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 64:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#008.md)

"Their own tongue to fall upon themselves." The arrows of idle words,
Although shot out of sight, and possibly quite forgotten, will hereafter
drop down upon the heads of such as drew the bow. Words are but wind, is
the common saying, but they are such wind as will either blow the soul
to its haven of rest, if holy, wholesome, savoury, spiritual, and
tending to edification, or else sink it into the Dead Sea, and
bottomless gulf of eternal misery, if idle, prophane, frothy, and
unprofitable. - Edward Reyner (1600-1670), in "Rules for the Government
of the Tongue."

[Psa 64:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#010.md)

"The righteous shall be glad in the Lord, and shall trust in him." That
is, if they have failed in their trust heretofore, and not given God
honour by confiding in him, yet these wonderful works of God (of which
he speaks in the Psalm) work this hope. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 64:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#010.md)

"All the upright in heart," The word of this text, jashar, signifies
rectitudinem, and planitiem, it signifies a direct way; for the devil's
way was circular, compassing the earth; but the angel's way to heaven
upon Jacob's ladder was a straight, a direct way. And then it signifies,
as a direct and straight, so a plain, a smooth, an even way, a way that
hath been beaten into a path before, a way that the fathers and the
church have walked in before, and not a discovery made by our curiosity,
or our confidence, in venturing from ourselves, or embracing from
others, new doctrines and opinions. The persons, then, whom God proposes
to be partakers of his retributions, are first; recti (that is, both
direct men, and plain men), and then, recti corde, this qualification,
this straightness and smoothness must be in the heart; all the upright
in heart shall have it. Upon this earth, a man cannot possibly make one
step in a straight and a direct line. The earth itself being round,
every step we make upon it must necessarily be a segment, an arc of a
circle. But yet, though no piece of a circle be a straight line, yet if
we take any piece, nay, if we take the whole circle, there is no corner,
no angle in any place, in any entire circle. A perfect rectitude we
cannot have in any way in this world; in every calling there are some
inevitable temptations. But, though we cannot make up one circle of a
straight line (that is impossible to human frailty), yet we; may pass on
without angles and corners, that is, without disguises in our religion,
and without the love of craft and falsehood, and circumvention, in our
civil actions. A compass is a necessary thing in a ship, and the help of
that compass brings the ship home safe, and yet that compass hath some
variations, it doth not look directly north; neither is that star which
we call the north-pole, or by which we know the north-pole, the very
pole itself; but we call it so, and we make our uses of it, and our
conclusions by it, as if it were so, because it is the nearest star to
that pole. He that comes as near uprightness as infirmities admit, is an
upright man, though he have some obliquities. - John Donne.

[Psa 64:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#010.md)

"All the upright in heart shall glory." The Psalm began in the first
person singular, "Hear my voice, O God," but it ends by comprehending
all the righteous. He who is most anxious about his own salvation will
be found to be the man of the truest and widest love to others; while,
he who talks most of unselfishness in religion is generally the most
selfish We cannot take a more efficient method for benefiting others
than by being earnestly prayerful for ourselves that we may be preserved
from sin. Our example will in itself be useful, and our godliness, by
putting power into testimony, will increase the value of every rebuke,
exhortation, or encouragement we may utter. Our sin is or will be the
church's sorrow, and the way to make all the upright rejoice is to be
upright ourselves. - C.H.S.

[Psa 64:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#010.md)

"Shall glory." This retribution is expressed in the original in the word
halal; and halal, to those translators that made up our Book of Common
Prayer, presented the signification of gladness, for so it is there:
"They shall be glad." So it did to the translators that came after, for
there it is, "They shall rejoice;" and to our last translators it seemed
to signify glory, "They shall glory," say they. But the first
translation of all into our language (which was long before any of these
three), calls it praise, and puts it into the passive: "All men of
rightful heart shall be praised." And so truly jithhalelu, in the
original, bears it, nay, requires it; which is not of praise which they
shall give to God, but of a praise that they shall receive for having
served God with an upright heart; not that they shall praise God in
doing so, but that godly men shall praise them for having done so. All
this will grow naturally out of the root; for the root of this word is
lucere, splendere, to shine out in the eyes of men, and to create in
them a holy and a reverential admiration; as it was John Baptist's
praise, that he was "A burning and a shining lamp." Properly it is, by a
good and a holy exemplary life, to occasion others to set a right value
upon holiness, and to give a due respect for holy men..."Shall glory."
It is so far from diminishing this glory, as that it exalts our
consolation that God places this retribution in the future; if they do
not yet, certainly they shall glory, and if they do now, that glory
shall not go out, still they shall, they shall for ever glory. - John
Donne.

[Psalms 64:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 64:1</span></span>

1 Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer preserve my life from fear of the
enemy.

2 Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked: from the insurrection
of the workers of iniquity.

3 Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot their
arrows, even bitter words.

4 That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot
at him, and fear not.

5 They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of laying
snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?

6 They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both
the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep.

[Psa 64:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#001.md)

"Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer." It often helps devotion if we are
able to use the voice and speak audibly; but even mental prayer has a
voice with God which he will hear. We do not read that Moses had spoken
with his lips at the Red Sea, and yet the Lord said to him, "Why criest
thou which are unheard on earth may be among the best heard unto me?"
Prayers duty to note how constantly David turns to prayer; it is his in
heaven. It is our duty to note how constantly David turns to prayer; it
is his battleaxe and weapon of war he uses it under every pressure,
whether of inward sin or outward wrath, foreign invasion or domestic
rebellion. We shall act wisely if we make prayer to God our first and
best trusted resource in every hour of need. "Preserve my life from fear
of the enemy." From harm and dread of harm protect me; or it may be read
as an expression of his assurance that it would be so; "from fear of the
foe thou wilt preserve me." With all our sacrifices of prayer we should
offer the salt of faith.

[Psa 64:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#002.md)

"Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked." From their hidden
snares hide me. Circumvent their counsels; let their secrets be met by
thy secret providence, their counsels of malice by thy counsels of love.
"From the insurrection of the workers of iniquity." When their secret
counsels break forth into clamorous tumults, be thou still my preserver.
When they think evil, let thy divine thoughts defeat them; and when they
do evil, let thy powerful justice overthrow them: in both cases, let me
be out of reach of their cruel hand, and even out of sight of their evil
eye. It is a good thing to conquer malicious foes, but a better thing
still to be screened from all conflict with them, by being hidden from
the strife. The Lord knows how to give his people peace, and when he
wills to make quiet, he is more than a match for all disturbers, and can
defeat alike their deep-laid plots and their overt hostilities.

[Psa 64:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#003.md)

"Who whet their tongue like a sword." Slander has ever been the master
weapon of the good man's enemies, and great is the care of the malicious
to use it effectively. As warriors grind their swords, to give them an
edge which will cut deep and wound desperately, so do the unscrupulous
invent falsehoods which shall be calculated to inflict pain, to stab the
reputation, to kill the honour of the righteous. What is there which an
evil tongue will not say? What misery will it not labour to inflict?
"And bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words." Far off
they dart their calumnies, as archers shoot their poisoned arrows. They
studiously and with force prepare their speech as bended bows, and then
with cool, deliberate aim, they let fly the shaft which they have dipped
in bitterness. To sting, to inflict anguish, to destroy, is their one
design. Insult, sarcasm, taunting defiance, nicknaming, all these were
practised among Orientals as a kind of art; and if in these Western
regions, with more refined manners, we are less addicted to the use of
rough abuse, it is yet to be feared that the less apparent venom of the
tongue inflicts none the less poignant pain. However, in all cases, let
us fly to the Lord for help. David had but the one resource of prayer
against the twofold weapons of the wicked, for defence against sword or
arrow he used the one defence of faith in God.

[Psa 64:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#004.md)

"That they may shoot in secret at the perfect." They lie in ambush, with
bows ready bent to aim a coward's shaft at the upright man. Sincere and
upright conduct will not secure us from the assaults of slander. The
devil shot at our Lord himself, and we may rest assured he has a fiery
dart in reserve for us; He was absolutely perfect, we are only so in a
relative sense, hence in us there is fuel for fiery darts to kindle on.
Observe the meanness of malicious men; they will not accept fair combat,
they shun the open field, and skulk in the bushes, lying in ambush
against those who are not so acquainted with deceit as to suspect their
treachery, and are too manly to imitate their despicable modes of
warfare. "Suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not." To secrecy they
add suddenness. They give their unsuspecting victim no chance of
defending himself; they pounce on him like a wild beast leaping on its
prey. They lay their plans so warily that they fear no detection. We
have seen in daily life the arrow of calumny wounding its victim sorely;
and yet we have not been able to discover the quarter from which the
weapon was shot, nor to detect the hand which forged the arrowhead, or
tinged it with the poison. Is it possible for justice to invent a
punishment sufficiently severe to meet the case of the dastard who
defiles my good name, and remains himself in concealment? An open liar
is an angel compared with this demon. Vipers and cobras are harmless and
amiable creatures compared with such a reptile. The devil himself might
blush at being the father of so base an offspring.

[Psa 64:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#005.md)

"They encourage themselves in an evil matter." Good men are frequently
discouraged, and not unfrequently discourage one another, but the
children of darkness are wise in their generation and keep their spirits
up, and each one has a cheering word to say to his fellow villain.
Anything by which they can strengthen each other's hands in their one
common design they resort to; their hearts are thoroughly in their black
work. "They commune of laying snares privily." Laying their heads
together they count and recount their various devices, so as to come at
some new and masterly device. They know the benefit of co-operation, and
are not sparing in it they pour their experience "into one common fund,
they teach each other fresh methods." They say, "Who shall see them?" So
sedulously do they mask their attacks, that they defy discovery; their
pitfalls are too well hidden, and themselves too carefully concealed to
be found out. So they think, but they forget the all-seeing eye, and the
all-discovering hand, which are ever hard by them. Great plots are
usually laid bare. As in the Gunpowder Plot, there is usually a
breakdown somewhere or other; among the conspirators themselves truth
finds an ally, or the stones of the field cry out against them. Let no
Christian be in bondage through fear of deep-laid Jesuitical schemes for
surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, nor divination against
Israel; the toils of the net are broken, the arrows of the bow are
snapped, the devices of the wicked are foiled. Therefore, fear not, ye
tremblers; for the Lord is at your right hand, and ye shall not be hurt
of the enemy.

[Psa 64:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#006.md)

"They search out iniquities." Diligently they consider, invent, devise,
and seek for wicked plans to wreak their malice. These are no common
villains, but explorers in iniquity, inventors and concoctors of evil.
Sad indeed it is that to ruin a good man the evil-disposed will often
show as much avidity as if they were revealing as much skill as the
machinery of our modern exhibitions. The deep places of history,
manifesting most the skill of the human mind, are those in which revenge
has arranged diplomacy, and used intrigue to compass its diabolical
purposes. "They accomplish a diligent search." Their design is
perfected, consummated, and brought into working order. They cry
"Eureka;" they have sought and found the sure method of vengeance.
Exquisite are the refinements of malice! hell's craft furnishes
inspiration to the artistes who fashion deceit. Earth and the places
under it are ransacked for the materiel of war, and profound skill turns
all to account. "Both the inward thought of every one of them, and the
heart, is deep." No superficial wit is theirs; but sagacity, sharpened
by practice and keen hatred. Wicked men have frequently the craft to
hasten slowly, to please in order to ruin, to flatter that ere long they
may devour, to bow the knee that they may ultimately crush beneath their
foot. He who deals with the serpent's seed has good need of the wisdom
which is from above: the generation of vipers twist and turn, wind and
wriggle, yet evermore they are set upon their purpose, and go the
nearest way to it when they wander round about, Alas! how dangerous is
the believer's condition, and how readily may he be overcome if left to
himself. This is the complaint of reason and the moan of unbelief. When
faith comes in, we see that even in all this the saints are still
secure, for they are all in the hands of God.

[Psalms 64:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 64:7</span></span>

7 But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be
wounded.

8 So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that
see them shall flee away.

9 And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they
wisely consider of his doing.

10 The righteous shall be glad in the Lord, and shall trust in him; and
all the upright in heart shall glory.

[Psa 64:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#007.md)

"But God shall shoot at them with an arrow." They shoot, and shall be
shot. A greater archer than they are shall take sure aim at their
hearts. One of his arrows shall be enough, for he never misses his aim.
The Lord turns the fables on his adversaries, and defeats them at their
own weapons. "Suddenly shall they be wounded." They were looking to,
surprise the saint, but, lo! they are taken at unawares themselves; they
desired to inflict deadly wounds, and are smitten themselves with wounds
which none can heal. While they were bending their bows, the great Lord
had prepared his bow already, and he let slip the shaft when least they
looked for such an unsparing messenger of justice. "Vengeance is mine; I
will repay, saith the Lord." The righteous need not learn the arts of
self-defence or of attack, their avenge went is in better hands than
their own.

[Psa 64:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#008.md)

"So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves." Their
slander shall recoil. Their curses shall come home to roost. Their
tongue shall cut their throats. It was both sword, and bow and arrow; it
shall be turned against them, and bring home to them full punishment.
"All that see them shall flee away." Afraid, both of them and their
overthrow, their former friends shall give them wide space, lest they
perish with them. Who cares to go near to Herod when the worms are
eating him? or to be in the same chariot with Pharaoh when the waves
roar round him? Those who crowded around a powerful persecutor, and
cringed at his feet, are among the first to desert him in the day of
wrath. Woe unto you, ye liars! Who will desire fellowship with you in
your seething lake of fire?

[Psa 64:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#009.md)

"And all men shall fear." They shall be filled with awe by the just
judgments of God, as the Canaanites were by the overthrow of Pharaoh at
the Red Sea. Those who might have been bold in sin shall be made to
tremble and to stand in awe of the righteous Judge. "And shall declare
the work of God." It shall become the subject of general conversation.
So strange, so pointed, so terrible shall be the Lord's overthrow of the
malicious, that it shall be spoken of in all companies. They sinned
secretly, but their punishment shall be wrought before the face of the
sun. "For they shall wisely consider of his doing." The judgments of God
are frequently so clear and manifest that men cannot mis-read them, and
if they have any thought at all, they must extract the true teaching
from them. Some of the divine judgments are a great deep, but in the
case of malicious persecutors the matter is plain enough, and the most
illiterate can understand.

[Psa 64:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#010.md)

"The righteous shall be glad in the Lord." Admiring his justice and
fully acquiescing in its displays, they shall also rejoice at the rescue
of injured innocence yet, their joy shall not be selfish or sensual, but
altogether in reference to the Lord. "And shall trust in him." Their
observation of providence shall increase their faith; since he who
fulfils his threatenings will not forget his promises. "And all the
upright in heart shall glory." The victory of the oppressed shall be the
victory of all upright men; the whole host of the elect shall rejoice in
the triumph of virtue. While strangers fear, the children are glad in
view of their Father's power and justice. That which alarms the evil,
cheers the good. Lord God of mercy, grant to us to be preserved from all
our enemies, and saved in thy Son with an everlasting salvation.
