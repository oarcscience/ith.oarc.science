### [Psalms Chapter 124](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 124:0</span></span>

Title. - A Song of degrees of David. Of course the superfine critics
have pounced upon this title as inaccurate, but we are at liberty to
believe as much or as little of their assertions as we may please. They
declare that there are certain ornaments of language in this little ode
which were unknown in the Davidic period. It mall be so; but in their
superlative wisdom they have ventured upon so many other questionable
statements that we are not bound to receive this dictum. Assuredly the
manner of the song is very like to David's, and we are unable to see why
he should be excluded from the authorship. Whether it be his composition
or no, it breathes the same spirit as that which animates the
unchallenged songs of the royal composer.

Division. - This short Psalm contains an acknowledgment of favour
received by way of special deliverance ([Psa
124:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#001).md), then a grateful act of
worship in blessing Jehovah ([Psa 124:6, 19
124:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#006).md), and, lastly, a declaration of
confidence in the Lord for all future time of trial. May our experience
lead us to the same conclusion as the saints of David's time. From all
confidence in man may we be rescued by a holy reliance upon our God.

Hints to Preachers

[Psa 124:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#001.md). - "The Lord who was on our
side." Who is he? Why on our side? How does he prove it? What are we
bound to do?

[Psa 124:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#001.md). - Regard the text,

I. From the life of Jacob or Israel.

II\. From the history of the nation.

III\. From the annals of the church.

[Psa 124:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#001.md). -

I. What might have been.

II\. Why it has not been.

[Psa 124:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#001.md). -

I. What the people of God would have been if the Lord had not been on

1\. What if left to their enemies? [Psa
124:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#002.md), [Psa
124:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#003.md). Israel left to Pharaoh and his
host in the time of Moses: left to the Canaanites in the time of Joshua:
to the Midianites in the time of Gideon: Judah to the Assyrians in the
time of. Hezekiah, "Then they had swallowed us up," etc.

2\. What if left to themselves? "The stream had gone over our soul":
[Psa 124:4, 19 124:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#004.md).

II\. What the people of God are with the Lord on their side.

1\. All the designs of their enemies against them are frustrated.

2\. Their inward sorrow is turned into joy.

3\. Both their inward and their outward troubles work together for their
good. - G. R.

[Psa 124:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#002.md), [Psa
124:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#003.md). -

I. To swallow us alive - the desire of our wrathful enemies.

II\. To save us alive - the work of our faithful God.

[Psa 124:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#004.md), [Psa
124:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#005.md). - Perils of waters: a number of
thoughts may be worked out from the likeness between afflictions and
torrents.

[Psa 124:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#006.md). -

I. The Lamb.

II\. The Lion.

III\. The Lord.

[Psa 124:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#006.md). -

I. They would gladly devour us.

II\. They cannot devour unless the Lord will.

III\. God is to be praised since he does not permit them to injure us.

[Psa 124:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#006.md). -

I. The ill-will of men against the righteous.

1\. For their spoliation.

2\. For their destruction: "As a prey to their teeth."

II\. The goodwill of God. "Blessed be the Lord," etc.

1\. What it supposes - that good men, in a measure and for a time, may
be given into the hands of the wicked.

2\. What it affirms - that they are not given entirely into their hands
- G. R.

[Psa 124:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#007.md). -

I. The soul ensnared.

1\. A. By whom? Wicked men are fowlers. By Satan.

"Satan, the fowler, who betrays

Unguarded souls a thousand ways."

2\. How? By temptations - to pride, worldliness, drunkenness, error, or
lust, according to the tastes and habits of the individual.

II\. The soul escaped, "Our soul is escaped," etc. "The snare is
broken," not by ourselves, but by the hand of God. - G. R.

[Psa 124:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#007.md). -

I. A bird.

II\. A snare.

III\. A capture.

IV\. An escape.

[Psa 124:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#008.md). - Our Creator, our Helper.
Special comfort to be drawn from creation in this matter.

[Psa 124:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#008.md). -

I. The Helper: "The Lord, who made heaven and earth," who in his works
has given ample proofs of what he can do.

II\. The helped. "Our help" is,

1\. Promised in his name.

2\. Sought in his name, these make it ours. - G. R.

[Psa 124:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#008.md). -

I. We have help. As troubled sinners, as dull scholars, as trembling
professors, as inexperienced travellers, as feeble workers.

II\. We have help in God's name.

1\. In his perfections - "They shall put my name upon the children of
Israel."

2\. In his gospel - "A chosen vessel to bear my name."

3\. In his authority - "In the name of Jesus Christ rise up," etc.

III\. Therefore we exert ourselves. - W. J.

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Title

The title informs us that this sacred march was composed by king David;
and we learn very clearly from the subject, that the progression
referred to was the triumphant return of the king and his loyal army to
Jerusalem, upon the overthrow of the dangerous rebellion to which the
great mass of the people had been excited by Absalom and his powerful
band of confederates. - John Mason Good.

Whole Psalm

This Psalm is ascribed to David. No reference is made to any specific
danger and deliverance. There is a delightful universality in the
language which suits it admirably for an anthem of the redeemed, in
every age and in every clime. The people of God still live in a hostile
territory. Traitors are in the camp, and there are numerous foes
without. And the church would soon be exterminated, if the malice and
might of her adversaries were not restrained and defeated by a higher
power. Hence this ode of praise has never become obsolete. How
frequently have its strains of adoring gratitude floated on the breeze!
What land is there, in which its outbursting gladness has not been
heard! It has been sung upon the banks of the Jordan and the Nile, the
Euphrates and the Tigris. It has been sung upon the banks of the Tiber
and the Rhine, the Thames and the Forth. It has been sung upon the banks
of the Ganges and the Indus, the Mississippi and the Irrawady. And we
anticipate a period when the church, surmounting all her difficulties,
and victory waving over her banners, shall sing this Psalm of praise in
every island and continent of our globe. The year of God's redeemed must
come. The salvation of Christ shall extend to the utmost extremities of
earth. And when this final emancipation takes place, the nations will
shout for joy, and praise their Deliverer in Psalms, and hymns, and
spiritual songs. - N. McMichael.

Whole Psalm

In the year 1582, this Psalm was sung on a remarkable occasion in
Edinburgh. An imprisoned minister, John Durie, had been set free, and
was met and welcomed on entering the town by two hundred of his friends.
The number increased till he found himself in the midst of a company of
two thousand, who began to sing, as they moved up the long High Street,
"Now Israel may say," etc. They sang in four parts with deep solemnity,
all joining in the well-known tune and Psalm. They were much moved
themselves, and so were all who heard; and one of the chief persecutors
is said to have been more alarmed at this sight and song than at
anything he had seen in Scotland. - Andrew A. Bonar, in "Christ and His
Church in the Book of Psalms," 1859.

[Psa 124:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#001.md)

"The Lord ... on our side." Jehovah is on the side of his people in a
spiritual sense, or otherwise it would be bad for them. God the Father
is on their side; his love and relation to them engage him to be so;
hence all those good things that are provided for them and bestowed on
them; nor will he suffer any to do them hurt, they being as dear to him
as the apple of his eye; hence he grants them his gracious presence,
supports them under all their trials and exercises, supplies all their
wants, and keeps them by his power, and preserves them from all their
enemies; so that they have nothing to fear from any quarter. Christ is
on their side; he is the Surety for them, the Saviour of them; has taken
their part against all their spiritual enemies, sin, Satan, the world,
and death; has engaged with them and conquered them; he is the Captain
of their salvation, their King at the head of them, that protects and
defends them here, and is their friend in the court of heaven; their
Advocate and interceding High-priest there, who pleads their cause
against Satan, and obtains every blessing for them. The Spirit of
Jehovah is on their side, to carry on his work in them; to assist them
in their prayers and supplications; to secure them from Satan's
temptations; to set up a standard for them when the enemy comes in like
a flood upon them; -and to comfort them in all their castings down; and
to work them up for, and bring them safe to heaven: but were this not
the case, what would become of them? - John Gill.

[Psa 124:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#001.md)

"Israel." The "Israel" spoken of in this Psalm may be Israel in the
house of Laban, in whose person the Midrash Tehillim imagines the Psalm
to be said. There are certainly some of its phrases which acquire an
appropriate meaning from being interpreted in this connection. - H. T.
Armfield.

[Psa 124:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#001.md)

Such abrupt and unfinished expressions in the beginning of the Psalm
indicate the great joy and exultation that will not suffer the speaker
to finish his sentences. - Robert Bellarmine.

[Psa 124:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#001.md), [Psa
124:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#002.md)

The somewhat paraphrastic rendering of these verses (with the
unnecessary interpolation of the words in italics in the Authorised
Version) greatly weaken their force and obscure their meaning. There is
far more meant and expressed than simply that God gave the Israelites
the victory over their enemies. The Psalm is typico-prophetic. It sets
forth the condition of the church in this world, surrounded by enemies,
implacable in their hatred, maddened by rage, and bent on her
destruction. It gives assurance of her preservation, and continuous
triumph, because Jehovah is her God. It foretells the future, full, and
final destruction of all her enemies. It re-echoes the song sung on the
shores of the Red Sea. In it are heard the notes of the New Song before
the great white throne. The praise and thanksgiving are to יהוה, the
revealed אלהים, whose "eternal power and Godhead are understood by the
things that are made:" - to יהוה, the revealed אל שׁדּים, whom the
fathers knew as the Almighty, from the great things which he did for
them: - to יהוה, the God who has made a covenant with his people, the
Redeemer. It is ישׂראל, the chosen people of God, the holy nation, the
peculiar treasure to him above all peoples, and thus become as the
Rabbins say, "Odium generis humani," against whom אדם (not men, but man
collectively) rose up, and sought to destroy. It is ישׂראל, God's
chosen, the people of the covenant, that with the "full delight of a
personal 'my,'" joys in God and sings, "But that Jehovah was לנוּ,
ours!" Tame and frigid the rendering - "was on our side." Jehovah was
theirs: that, their safety: that their blessedness: that, their joy. -
Edward Thomas Gibson, 1818-1880.

[Psa 124:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#001.md), [Psa
124:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#002.md)

I. God was on our side; he took our part, espoused our cause and
appeared for us. He was our helper, and a very present help, a help on
our side, nigh at hand. He was with us; not only for us, but among us,
and commander-in-chief of our forces.

II\. That God was Jehovah; there the emphasis lies. "If it had not been
Jehovah himself, a God of infinite power and perfection, that had
undertaken our deliverance, our enemies would have overpowered us. Happy
the people therefore whose God is Jehovah, a God all-sufficient. Let
Israel say this to his honour, and resolve never to forsake him." -
Matthew Henry.

[Psa 124:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#001.md), [Psa
124:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#002.md), [Psa
124:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#008.md)

These three things will I bear on my heart, O Lord: "The Lord was on our
side," this for the past; "The snare is broken," for the present; "Our
help is in the name of the Lord," this for the future. I will not and I
cannot be fainthearted, whether in my contest with Satan, in my
intercourse with the world, or in the upheavings of my wicked heart, so
long as I hold this "threefold cord" in my hand, or rather, am held by
it. - Alfred Edersheim.

[Psa 124:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#002.md)

"If it had not been the Lord," etc. This repetition is not in vain. For
whilst we are in danger, our fear is without measure; but when it is
once past, we imagine it to have been less than it was indeed. And this
is the delusion of Satan, to diminish and obscure the grace of God.
David therefore with this repetition stirreth up the people to more
thankfulness unto God for his gracious deliverance, and amplifteth the
dangers which they had passed. Whereby we are taught how to think of our
troubles and afflictions past, lest the sense and feeling of God's grace
vanish out of our minds. - Martin Luther.

[Psa 124:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#002.md)

"Men rose up against us." It may seem strange that these wicked and
wretched enemies, monsters rather than men, should be thus moderately
spoken of, and have no other name than this of men given them, which of
all others they least deserved, as having in them nothing of man but
outward show and shape, being rather beasts, yea, devils in the form and
fashion of men, than right men. But hereby the church would show that
she did leave the further censuring of them unto God their righteous
Judge; and would also further amplify their wickedness, who being men,
did yet in their desires and dispositions bewray a more than beastly
immanity and inhumanity. - Daniel Dyke ( - 1614?) in "Comfortable
Sermons upon the 124 Psalme," 1617.

[Psa 124:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#003.md)

"Then they had swallowed us up quick." The metaphor may be taken from
famished wild beasts attacking and devouring men (comp. [Psa
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#005).md); or the reference may be to the
case of a man shut up alive in a sepulchre ([Pro
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#012).md) and left there to perish, or
([Num 16:30](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#030).md) swallowed up by an
earthquake. - Daniel Cresswell.

[Psa 124:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#003.md)

"Then they had swallowed us up." The word implieth eating with
insatiable appetite; every man that eateth must also swallow; but a
glutton is rather a swallower than an eater. He throws his meat whole
down his throat, and eats (as we may say) without chewing. The rod of
Moses, turned into a serpent, "swallowed up" the rods of the Egyptian
sorcerers. The word is often applied to express oppression ([Psa
35:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#025).md), "Let them not say in their
hearts, Ah, so would we have it, let them not say, We have swallowed him
up" that is, we have made clear riddance of him; he is now a gone man
for ever. The ravenous rage of the adversary is described in this
language. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 124:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#003.md)

"Quick." Not an adverb, "quickly," but an adjective, alive. As greedy
monsters, both of the land and of the deep, sometimes swallow their food
before the life is out of it, so would the enemies of the Church have
destroyed her as in a moment, but for divine interposition. - William S.
Plumer.

[Psa 124:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#003.md)

Objection. But what may the reason thereof be? May a man say, thus the
godly shall always prevail and be never overthrown by their enemies, but
overcome them rather? Experience doth teach us that they are fewer in
number than the wicked are, that they are weaker for power and strength,
that they are more simple for wit and policy, and that they are more
careless for diligence and watchfulness than their adversaries be, how,
then, comes it to pass that they have the upper hand?

Answer. The Prophet Esay doth declare it unto us in the 8th chapter of
his prophecy, and [Isa 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#010.md) thereof,
it is in few words "because the Lord is with them and for them."

I. For, first, he is stronger than all, being able to resist all power
that is devised against him and his, and to do whatsoever he will both
in heaven and in earth.

II\. He is wiser than all, knowing how to prevent them in all their
ways, and also how to bring matters to pass for the good of his people.

III\. He is diligenter than all, to stand, as it were, upon the watch,
and to take his advantage when it is offered him, for "He that keepeth
Israel doth neither slumber nor sleep."

IV\. Lastly, he is happier than all to have good success in all his
enterprizes, for he doth prosper still in all things which he doth take
in hand and none can resist a thought of his; yea, the very "word which
goeth out of his mouth doth accomplish that which he wills, and prosper
in the thing whereunto he doth send it." In war, all these four things
are respected in a captain that will still overcome, first, that he be
strong; secondly, that he be wise; thirdly, that he be diligent; and,
lastly, that he be fortunate; for the victory goeth not always with the
strong, nor always with the wise, nor always with the diligent, nor
always with the fortunate; but sometimes with the one of them, and
sometimes with the other, but look, where all four do concur together
there is always the victory, and therefore seeing all of them are in
God, it is no marvel though those whose battles he doth fight, do always
overcome and get the victory. - Thomas Stint, 1621.

[Psa 124:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#004.md), [Psa
124:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#005.md)

A familiar, but exceedingly apt and most significant figure. Horrible is
the sight of a raging conflagration; but far more destructive is a river
overflowing its banks and rushing violently on: for it is not possible
to restrain it by any strength or power. As, then, he says, a river is
carried along with great impetuosity, and carries away and destroys
whatever it meets with in its course; thus also is the rage of the
enemies of the church, not to be withstood by human strength. Hence, we
should learn to avail ourselves of the protection and help of God. For
what else is the church but a little boat fastened to the bank, which is
carried away by the force of the waters? or a shrub growing on the bank,
which without effort the flood roots up? Such was the people of Israel
in the days of David compared with the surrounding nations. Such in the
present day is the church compared with her enemies. Such is each one of
us compared with the power of the malignant spirit. We are as a little
shrub, of recent growth and having no firm hold: but he is like the
Elbe, overflowing, and with great force overthrowing all things far and
wide. We are like a withered leaf, lightly holding to the tree; he is
like the north wind, with great force rooting up and throwing down the
trees. How, then, can we withstand or defend ourselves by our own power?
- Martin Luther.

[Psa 124:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#004.md), [Psa
124:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#005.md)

First the "waters"; then "the stream" or torrent; then "the proud
waters," lifting up their heads on high. First the waters overwhelm us;
then the torrent goes over our soul; and then the proud waters go over
our soul. What power can resist the rapid floods of waters, when they
overspread their boundaries, and rush over a country? Onward they sweep
with resistless force, and men and cattle, and crops and houses, are
destroyed. Let the impetuous waters break loose, and, in a few minutes,
the scene of life, and industry, and happiness, is made a scene of
desolation and woe. Perhaps, there is an allusion here to the
destruction of the Egyptians in the Red Sea. The floods fell upon them,
the depths covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone. Had God
not stretched forth his hand to rescue the Israelites, their enemies
would have overwhelmed them. Happy they who, in seasons of danger, have
Jehovah for a hiding-place. - N. McMichael.

[Psa 124:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#005.md)

"Then the proud waters had gone over our seal." The same again, to note
the greatness both of the danger and of the deliverance. And it may
teach us not lightly to pass over God's great blessings, but to make the
most of them. - John Trapp.

[Psa 124:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#005.md)

"When winds and seas do rage,

And threaten to undo me,

Thou dost their wrath assuage.

If I but call unto thee.

A mighty storm last night

Did seek my soul to swallow

But by the peep of light

A gentle calm did follow.

What need I then despair

Though ills stand round about me;

Since mischiefs neither dare

To bark or bite without thee?"

Robert Herrick, 1591-1674.

[Psa 124:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#006.md), [Psa
124:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#007.md)

Two figures are again employed, in order to show how imminent was the
destruction, had there been no divine interposition. The first is that
of a savage beast, which was formerly used. But an addition is made, to
describe the urgency of the danger, The wild beast was not only lying in
wait for them; he was not merely ready to spring upon his prey, he had
already leaped upon it: he had actually seized it: it was even now
between his teeth. What a graphic description! A moment's delay, and all
help would have been in vain. But Jehovah appears on the ground. He goes
up to the ferocious beast, and takes out the trembling prey from between
his bloody jaws. The danger is imminent; but nothing is too hard for the
Lord. "My soul is among lions." "What time I am afraid I will trust Jn
thee." "He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of him
that would swallow me up." The second figure is that of a fowler. The
fowler has prepared his snare in a skilful manner. The bird enters it,
unconscious of danger, the net is thrown over it; and in an instant its
liberty is lost. There it lied, the poor bird, its little heart
throbbing wildly, and its little wings beating vainly against the net.
It is completely at the mercy of the fowler, and escape is impossible.
But again the Lord appears, and his presence is safety. He goes up to
the net, lifts it from the ground; the bird flies out, lights on a
neighbouring tree, and sings among the branches. "Surely he shall
deliver thee from the snare of the fowler." God rescues his people from
the craft and subtlety of their enemies, as he does from their open
violence. - N. McMichael.

[Psa 124:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#006.md), [Psa
124:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#007.md)

We were delivered,

I. Like a lamb out of the very jaws of a beast of prey: God "hath not
given us as a prey to their teeth"; intimating that they had no power
against God's people, but what was given them from above. They could not
be a prey to their teeth unless God gave them up, and therefore they
were rescued, because God would not suffer them to be ruined.

III\. Like "a bird," a little bird, the word signifies a sparrow, "out
of the snare of the fowler." The enemies are very subtle and spiteful,
they lay snares for God's people, to bring them into sin and trouble,
and to hold them there. Sometimes they seem to have prevailed so far as
to gain their point, the children of God are taken in the snare, and are
as unable to help themselves out as any weak and silly bird is; and then
is God's time to appear for their relief; when all other friends fail,
then God breaks the snare, and turns the counsel of the enemies into
foolishness: "The snare is broken, and so we are delivered." - Matthew
Henry.

[Psa 124:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#007.md)

"Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers," etc.
Various snares are placed for birds, by traps, bird-lime, guns, etc.:
who can enumerate all the dangers of the godly, threatening them from
Satan, and from the world? [Psa 91:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#003.md) :
[Hos 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001.md). - "We are delivered," not by
our own skill or cunning, but by the grace and power of God only: so
that every device is made vain, and freedom is preserved. - Martin
Geier.

[Psa 124:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#007.md)

"Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers," etc. I
am quite sure that there is not a day of our lives in which Satan does
not lay some snare for our souls, the more perilous because unseen; and
if seen, because perhaps unheeded and despised. And of this, too, I am
equally sure, that if any one brings home with him at night a conscience
void of offence towards God and man, it is in no might nor strength of
his own, and that if the Lord had not been his guide and preserver he
would have been given over, nay, he would have given himself over, as a
prey to the devourer's teeth. I believe there are few even of God's
saints who have not had occasion, in some season of sore temptation,
when Satan has let loose all his malice and might, and poured in
suggestion upon suggestion and trial upon trial, as he did on Job, and
they have been ready to faint, if not to fall by the way - then,
perhaps, in a moment when they looked not for it, Satan has departed,
foiled and discomfited, and with his prey snatched out of his hands, and
they, too, have had gratefully to own, "Our soul is escaped as a bird
out of the snare of the fowlers; the snare is broken, and we are
escaped." Yes! depend upon it, our best and only hope "is in the name of
the Lord, who made heaven and earth." - Barton Bouchier.

[Psa 124:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#007.md)

"Our soul is escaped as a bird." The snare of the fowler was the lime -
twigs of this world; our soul was caught in them by the feathers, our
affections' now, indeed, we are escaped; but the Lord delivered us. -
Thomas Adams.

[Psa 124:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#007.md)

"As a bird out of the snare of the fowlers." The soul is surrounded by
many dangers.

I. It is ensnared by worldliness. One of the most gigantic dangers
against which God's people have specially to guard - an enemy to all
spirituality of thought and feeling.

III\. It is ensnared by selfishness - a foe to all simple-hearted
charity, to all expansive generosity and Christian philanthropy.

IV\. It is ensnared by unbelief - the enemy of prayer, of ingenuous
confidence, of all personal Christian effort. These are not imaginary
dangers. We meet them in everyday life. They threaten us at every point,
and often have we to lament over the havoc they make in our hearts. -
George Barlow, in a "Homiletic Commentary on the Book of Psalms," 1879.

[Psa 124:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#007.md)

"The snare is broken." It is as easy for God to deliver his people out
of their enemies' hands, even when they have the godly in their power,
as to break a net made of thread or yarn, wherewith birds are taken. -
David Dickson.

[Psa 124:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#007.md)

"The snare is broken, and we are escaped." Our life lieth open always to
the snares of Satan, and we as silly birds are like at every moment to
be carried away, notwithstanding the Lord maketh a way for us to escape;
yea, when Satan seemeth to be most sure of us, by the mighty power of
God the snares are broken and we are delivered. Experience we have
hereof in those who are inwardly afflicted and with heaviness of spirit
grievously oppressed, that when they seem to be in utter despair, and
ready now, as you would say, to perish, yet even at the last pinch, and
in the uttermost extremity cometh the sweet comfort of God's Holy Spirit
and raiseth them up again. When we are most ready to perish, then is God
most ready to help. "Except the Lord had holpen me," saith David, "my
soul had almost dwelt in silence." And this again do we mark for the
comfort of the weak conscience. It is Satan's subtlety whereby commonly
he disquiets many, that because carnal corruption is in them he would
therefore bear them in hand that they are none of Christ's. In this he
plays the deceiver; he tries us by the wrong rule of perfect
sanctification; this is the square that ought to be laid to Christ's
members triumphant in heaven, and not to those who are militant on
earth. Sin remaining in me will not prove that therefore I am not in
Christ, otherwise Christ should have no members upon earth; but grace
working that new disposition which nature could never effect proves
undoubtedly that we are in Christ Jesus. - Thomas Stint.

[Psa 124:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#008.md)

"Our help is in the name of the Lord who made heaven and earth." He hath
made the earth where the snare lies, so that he can rightfully destroy
the snare as laid unlawfully in his domain; he hath made the heaven, the
true sphere of the soaring wings of those souls which he has delivered,
so that they may fly upwards from their late prison, rejoicing. He came
down to earth himself, the Lord Jesus in whose name is our help, that he
might break the snare; he returned to heaven, that we might fly "as the
doves to their windows" ([Isa 60:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#008).md),
following where he showed the way. - Richard Rolle, of Hampole (1340),
in "Neale and Littledale."

[Psa 124:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#008.md)

"Our help is in the name of the Lord." The fairest fruits of our by-past
experience is to glorify God by confidence in him for time to come, as
here. - David Dickson.

[Psa 124:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#008.md)

"The Lord who made heaven and earth." As if the Psalmist had said, As
long as I see heaven and earth I will never distrust. I hope in that God
which made all these things out of nothing; and therefore as long as I
see those two great standing monuments of his power before me, heaven
and earth, I will never be discouraged. So the apostle: [Pe1
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#019.md), "Commit the keeping of your
souls to him in well-doing, as unto a faithful Creator." O Christian I
remember when you trust God you trust an almighty Creator, who is able
to help, let your case be never so desperate. God could create when he
had nothing to work upon, which made one wonder; and he could create
when he had nothing to work with, which is another wonder. What is
become of the tools wherewith he made the world? Where is the trowel
wherewith he arched the heaven? and the spade wherewith he digged the
sea? What had God to work upon, or work withal when he made the world?
He made it out of nothing. Now you commit your souls to the same
faithful Creator. - Thomas Manton.

[Psa 124:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#008.md)

The Romans in a great distress were put so hard to it, that they were
fain to take the weapons out of the temples of their gods to fight with
them; and so they overcame. And this ought to be the course of every
good Christian, in times of public distress, to fly to the weapons of
the church, prayers and tears. The Spartans' walls were their spears,
the Christians' walls are his prayers. His help standeth in the name of
the Lord who hath made both heaven and earth. - Edmund Calamy.

[Psa 124:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#008.md)

The French Protestants always begin their public worship with [Psa
124:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#008.md), and there is no thought more
encouraging and comfortable. - Job Orton, 1717-1783.

[Psa 124:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#008.md)

"Our help is in the name of the Lord." etc. These are the words of a
triumphing and victorious faith, "Our help standeth in the name of the
Lord, which made heaven and earth": as if he said, the Maker of heaven
and earth is my God and my helper. Ye see whither he flieth in his great
distress. He despaireth not, but crieth unto the Lord, as one yet hoping
assuredly to find relief and comfort. Rest thou also in this hope, and
do as he did. David was not tempted to the end he should despair; think
not thou, therefore, that thy temptations are sent unto thee that thou
shouldest be swallowed up with sorrow and desperation: if thou be
brought down to the very gates of hell, believe that the Lord will
surely raise thee up again. If so thou be bruised and broken, know it is
the Lord that will help thee again. If thy heart be full of sorrow and
heaviness, look for comfort from him, who said, that a troubled spirit
is a sacrifice unto him,([Psa 51:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#017)..md)
Thus he setteth the eternal God, the Maker of heaven and earth, against
all troubles and dangers, against the floods and overflowings of all
temptations, and swalloweth up, as it were, with one breath all the
raging furies of the whole world, and of hell itself, even as a little
drop of water is swallowed up by a mighty flaming fire, and what is the
world with all its force and power, in respect of him that made heaven
and earth! - Thomas Stint.

[Psalms 124:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 124:1</span></span>

1 If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, now may Israel say:

2 If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, when men rose up
against us:

3 Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled
against us:

4 Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul:

5 Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.

[Psa 124:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#001.md)

"If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, now may Israel say."
The opening sentence is abrupt, and remains a fragment. By such a
commencement attention was aroused as well as feeling expressed: and
this is ever the way of poetic fire - to break forth in uncontrollable
flame. The many words in italics in our authorized version will show the
reader that the translators did their best to patch up the passage,
which, perhaps, had better have been left in its broken grandeur, and it
would then have run thus: -

"Had it not been Jehovah! He was for us, oh let Israel say!

Had it not been Jehovah! He who was for us when men rose against us."

The glorious Lord became our ally; he took our part, and entered into
treaty with us. If Jehovah were not our protector where should we be?
Nothing but his power and wisdom could have guarded us from the cunning
and malice of our adversaries; therefore, let all his people say so, and
openly give him the honour of his preserving goodness. Here are two
"ifs," and yet there is no "if" in the matter. The Lord was on our side,
and Is still our defender, and will be so from henceforth, even for
ever. Let us with holy confidence exult in this joyful fact. We are far
too slow in declaring our gratitude, hence the exclamation which should
be rendered, "O let Israel say." We murmur without being stirred up to
it, but our thanksgiving needs a spur, and it is well when some
warm-hearted friend bids us say what we feel. Imagine what would have
happened if the Lord had left us, and then see what has happened because
he has been faithful to us. Are not all the materials of a song spread
before us? Let us sing unto the Lord.

[Psa 124:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#002.md)

"If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, when men rose up
against us." When all men combined, and the whole race of men seemed set
upon stamping out the house of Israel, what must have happened if the
covenant Lord had not interposed? When they stirred themselves, and
combined to make an assault upon our quietude and safety, what should we
have done in their rising if the Lord had not also risen? No one who
could or would help was near, but the bare arm of the Lord sufficed to
preserve his own against all the leagued hosts of adversaries. There is
no doubt as to our deliverer, we cannot ascribe our salvation to any
second cause, for it would not have been equal to the emergency; nothing
less than omnipotence and omniscience could have wrought our rescue. We
set every other claimant on one side, and rejoice because the Lord was
on our side.

[Psa 124:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#003.md)

"Then they had swallowed us up quick when their wrath was kindled
against us." They were so eager for our destruction that they would have
made only one morsel of us, and have swallowed us up alive and whole in
a single instant. The fury of the enemies of the church is raised to the
highest pitch, nothing will content them but the total annihilation of
God's chosen. Their wrath is like a fire which is kindled, and has taken
such firm hold upon the fuel that there is no quenching it. Anger is
never more fiery than when the people of God are its objects. Sparks
become flames, and the furnace is heated seven times hotter when God's
elect are to be thrust into the blaze. The cruel world would make a full
end of the godly seed were it not that Jehovah bars the way. When the
Lord appears, the cruel throats cannot swallow, and the consuming fires
cannot destroy. Ah, if it were not Jehovah, if our help came from all
the creatures united, there would be no way of escape for us: it is only
because the Lord liveth that his people are alive.

[Psa 124:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#004.md)

"Then the waters had overwhelmed us." Rising irresistibly, like the
Nile, the flood of opposition would soon have rolled over our heads.
Across the mighty waste of waters we should have cast an anxious eye,
but looked in vain for escape. The motto of a royal house is, "Tossed
about but not submerged": we should have needed an epitaph rather than
an epigram, for we should have been driven by the torrent and sunken,
never to rise again. "The stream had gone over our soul." The rushing
torrent would have drowned our soul, our hope, our life. The figures
seem to be the steadily-rising flood, and the hurriedly-rushing stream.
Who can stand against two such mighty powers? Everything is destroyed by
these unconquerable forces, either by being submerged or swept away.
When the world's enmity obtains a vent it both rises and rushes, it
rages and rolls along, and spares nothing. In the great water-floods of
persecution and affliction who can help but Jehovah? But for him where
would we be at this very hour? We have experienced seasons in which the
combined forces of earth and hell must have made an end of us had not
omnipotent grace interfered for our rescue.

[Psa 124:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#005.md)

"Then the proud waters had gone over our soul." The figure represents
the waves as proud, and so they seem to be when they overleap the
bulwarks of a frail bark, and threaten every moment to sink her. The
opposition of men is usually embittered by a haughty scorn which derides
all our godly efforts as mere fanaticism or obstinate ignorance. In all
the persecutions of the church a cruel contempt has largely mingled with
the oppression, and this is overpowering to the soul. Had not God been
with us our disdainful enemies would have made nothing of us, and dashed
over us as a mountain torrent sweeps down the side of a hill, driving
everything before it. Not only would our goods and possessions have been
carried off, but our soul, our courage, our hope would have been borne
away by the impetuous assault, and buried beneath the insults of our
antagonists. Let us pause here, and as we see what might have been, let
us adore the guardian power which has kept us in the flood, and yet
above the flood. In our hours of dire peril we must have perished had
not our Preserver prevailed for our safe keeping.

[Psalms 124:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 124:6</span></span>

6 Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.

7 Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the
snare is broken, and we are escaped.

[Psa 124:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#006.md)

"Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth."
Leaving the metaphor of a boiling flood, he con-pares the adversaries of
Israel to wild beasts who desired to make the godly their prey. Their
teeth are prepared to tear, and they regard the godly as their victims.
The Lord is heartily praised for not permitting his servants to be
devoured when they were between the jaws of the raging ones. It implies
that none can harm us till the Lord permits: we cannot be their prey
unless the Lord gives us up to them, and that our loving Lord will never
do. Hitherto he has refused permission to any foe to destroy us, blessed
be his name. The more imminent the danger the more eminent the mercy
which would not permit the soul to perish in it. God be blessed for ever
for keeping us from the curse. Jehovah be praised for checking the fury
of the foe, and saving his own. The verse reads like a merely negative
blessing, but no boon can be more positively precious. He has given us
to his Son Jesus, and he will never give us to our enemies.

[Psa 124:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#007.md)

"Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers." Our
soul is like a bird for many reasons; but in this case the point of
likeness is weakness, folly, and the ease with which it is enticed into
the snare. Fowlers have many methods of taking small birds, and Satan,
has many methods of entrapping souls. Some are decoyed by evil
companions, others are enticed by the love of dainties; hunger drives
many into the trap, and fright impels numbers to fly into the net.
Fowlers know their birds, and how to take them; but the birds see not
the snare so as to avoid it, and they cannot break it so as to escape
from it. Happy is the bird that hath a deliverer strong, and mighty, and
ready in the moment of peril; happier still is the soul over which the
Lord watches day and night to pluck its feet out of the net. What joy
there is in this song, "our soul is escaped." How the emancipated one
sings and soars, and soars and sings again. Blessed be God many of us
can make joyous music with these notes, "our soul is escaped." Escaped
from our natural slavery; escaped from the guilt, the degradation, the
habit, the dominion of sin; escaped from the vain deceits and
fascinations of Satan; escaped from all that can destroy; we do indeed
experience delight. What a wonder of grace it is! What a miraculous
escape that we who are so easily misled should not have been permitted
to die by the dread fowler's hand. The Lord has heard the prayer which
he taught us to pray, and he hath delivered us from evil. "The snare is
broken, and we are escaped." The song is worth repeating; it is well to
dwell upon so great a mercy. The snare may be false doctrine, pride,
lust, or a temptation to indulge in policy, or to despair, or to
presume; what a high favour it is to have it broken before our eyes, so
that it has no more power over us. We see not the mercy while we are in
the snare; perhaps we are so foolish as to deplore the breaking of the
Satanic charm; the gratitude comes when the escape is seen, and when we
perceive what we have escaped from, and by what hand we have been set
free. Then our Lord has a song from our mouths and hearts as we make
heaven and earth ring with the notes, "the snare is broken, and we are
escaped." We have been tempted, but not taken; cast down, but not
destroyed; perplexed, but not in despair; in deaths oft, but still
alive, blessed be Jehovah!

This song might well have suited our whole nation at the time of the
Spanish Armada, the church in the days of the Jesuits, and each believer
among us in seasons of strong personal temptation.

[Psalms 124:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 124:8</span></span>

8 Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.

"Our help," our hope for the future, our ground of confidence in all
trials present and to come. "Is in the name of the Lord." Jehovah's
revealed character is our foundation of confidence, his person is our
sure fountain of strength. "Who made heaven and earth." Our Creator is
our preserver. He is immensely great in his creating work; he has not
fashioned a few little things alone, but all heaven and the whole round
earth are the works of his hands. When we worship the Creator let us
increase our trust in our Comforter. Did he create all that we see, and
can he not preserve us from evils which we cannot see? Blessed be his
name, he that has fashioned us will watch over us; yea, he has done so,
and rendered us help in the moment of jeopardy. He is our help and our
shield, even he alone. He will to the end break every snare. He made
heaven for us, and he will keep us for heaven; he made the earth, and he
will succour us upon it until the hour cometh for our departure. Every
work of his hand preaches to us the duty and the delight of reposing
upon him only. All nature cries, "Trust ye in the Lord for ever, for in
the Lord Jehovah there is everlasting strength." "Wherefore comfort one
another with these words."

The following versification of the sense rather than the words of this
Psalm is presented to the reader with much diffidence: -

Had not the Lord, my soul may cry,

Had not the Lord been on my side;

Had he not brought deliverance nigh,

Then must my helpless soul have died.

Had not the Lord been on my side,

My soul had been by Satan slain;

And Tophet, opening large and wide,

Would not have gaped for me in vain.

Lo, floods of wrath, and floods of hell,

In fierce impetuous torrents roll;

Had not the Lord defended well,

The waters had o'erwhelm'd my soul.

As when the fowler's snare is broke,

The bird escapes on cheerful wings;

My soul, set free from Satan's yoke,

With joy bursts forth, and mounts and sings.

She sings the Lord her Saviour's praise;

Sings forth his praise with joy and mirth;

To him her song in heaven she'll raise,

To him that made both heaven and earth.
