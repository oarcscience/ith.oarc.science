### [Psalms Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 35:0</span></span>

Title - A Psalm of David - Here is all we know concerning this Psalm,
but internal evidence seems to fix the date of its composition in those
troublous times when Saul hunted David over hill and dale, and when
those who fawned upon the cruel king, slandered the innocent object of
his wrath, or it may be referred to the unquiet days of frequent
insurrections in David's old age. The whole Psalm is the appeal to
heaven of a bold heart and a clear conscience, irritated beyond measure
by oppression and malice. Beyond a doubt David's Lord may be seen here
by the spiritual eye.

Divisions - The most natural mode of dividing this Psalm is to note its
triple character. Its complaint, prayer, and promise of praise are
repeated with remarkable parallelism three times, even as our Lord in
the Garden prayed three times using the same words. The first portion
occupies from [Psa 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#001.md), the second
from [Psa 35:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#011.md), and the last from
[Psa 35:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#019.md) to the close: each section
ending with a note of grateful song.

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Whole Psalm

Bonar entitles this Psalm, "The awful utterance of the Righteous One
regarding those that hate him without cause;" and he makes the following
remarks thereupon: - "Throughout the endless day of eternity the Lord
Jesus shall himself speak the Father's 'praise,' and shall put marked
emphasis on his 'righteousness' - that righteousness which shall have
been exhibited, both in the doom of those who hated the offered
Redeemer, and in the salvation of those who received him. There is
nothing in all this wherein his own may not fully join, especially on
that day when their views of justice shall be far clearer and fuller
than now. On that day we shall be able to understand how Samuel could
hew Agag in pieces, and the godly hosts of Israel slay utterly in Canaan
man and woman and child, at God's command. We shall be able, not only
fully to agree in the doom, 'Let them be confounded,' etc., but even to
sing, 'Amen, Hallelujah,' over the smoke of torment. [Rev
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#001.md), [Rev
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#002.md). We should in some measure now be
able to use every verse of this Psalm in the spirit in which the Judge
speaks it, we feeling ourselves his assessors in judging the world. [Co1
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#002.md). We shall, at all events, be able
to use it on that day when what is written here shall be all
accomplished." - Andrew A. Bonar.

[Psa 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#001.md)

"Plead my cause, O God, with them that strive with me." 1. Doth the
world condemn thee for thy zeal in the service of God? Reproachfully
scorn thee for thy care to maintain good works? not blush to traduce
thee with imputations of preciseness, conceited singularity, pharisaical
hypocrisy? Oh but if thy conscience condemn thee not all this while, if
that be rectified by the sacred word of God, if thou aim at his glory in
pursuing thine own salvation, and side not with the disturbers of the
church, go on, good Christian, in the practice of piety, discourage not
thyself in thy laudable endeavours, but recount with comfort that the
Lord is thy judge ([Co1 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#004).md), with a
scio cui crediderim, "I know whom I have believed." [Ti2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#012.md). 2. Art thou wrongfully adjudged
in the erroneous courts of men? are truth and righteousness gone aside
from their proper places? Is equity neglected, and poverty overlaid?
Well, have patience awhile, cheer up thy fainting spirits, there is a
God that beholdeth the innocency of thy cause, unto whom thou hast
liberty to make thy last appeal: "Plead my cause, O Lord, with them that
strive with me: fight against them that fight against me." Or, 3. Art
thou otherwise injured by the hands of malicious men? and doth a
penurious estate disable thee to sue for amends? Doth a Nimrod oppress
thee? A Laban defraud thee? A covetous landlord gripe thee? Well, yet
take not the matter into thine own hands by attempting unlawful courses;
presume not to be judge in thine own cause, for default of a present
redress; but often remember what the apostle taught his Thessalonians:
"It is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that
trouble you." - Isaac Craven's Sermon at Paul's Cross, 1630.

[Psa 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#001.md)

"Plead," etc. More literally, litigate, O Lord, with them that litigate
against me, contend against them that contend with me; i.e., avenge me
of mine adversaries. - Daniel Cresswell, D.D., F.R.S., in "The Psalms of
David according to the Book of Common Prayer: with Critical and
Explanatory Notes," 1843.

[Psa 35:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#002.md)

"Shield and buckler." The word rendered "shield" is in the Hebrew text
מגן, magen, which was a short buckler intended merely for defence. The
word rendered "buckler" is עגּה tsinnah; it was double the weight of the
magen, and was carried by the infantry; the magen, being lighter and
more manageable, was used by the cavalry. The tsinnah answered to the
scutum, and the magen to the clypeus, among the Romans. The word
tsinnah, means that kind of shield from the middle of which there arose
a large boss, surmounted by a dagger, and which was highly useful both
as a defensive and an offensive weapon in ancient warfare. - James
Anderson, note to Calvin in loc.

[Psa 35:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#003.md)

"Draw out the spear, and stop the way." The spear in the days of Saul
and David was a favourite weapon. (See 1 Chron. 11). A valiant man
bravely defending a narrow pass might simply with his lance keep back a
pursuing host, and give time for his friends to escape. Very remarkable
were the feats of valour of this sort performed in Oriental warfare.
David would have his God become his heroic defender, making his enemies
pause. - C. H. S.

[Psa 35:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#003.md)

"Draw out;" or, as the Hebrew phrase is, empty, that is unsheath the
like is of the sword. [Exo 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#009.md); [Lev
26:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#033.md). - Henry Ainsworth.

[Psa 35:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#003.md)

"Say unto my soul, I am thy salvation." Observe, 1. That salvation may
be made sure to a man. David would never pray for that which could not
be. Nor would Peter charge us with a duty which stood not in possibility
to be performed. [Pe2 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#010.md). "Make your
election sure." And to stop the bawling throats of all cavilling
adversaries, Paul directly proves it: "Know ye not your own selves, how
that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?" [Co2
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#005.md). We may then know that Christ is
in us. If Christ be in us, we are in Christ; if we be in Christ, we
cannot be condemned, for ([Rom 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#001).md)
"There is no damnation to them which are in Christ Jesus." But I leave
this point that it may be sure, as granted; and come to ourselves that
we may make it sure. The Papists deny this, and teach the contrary, that
salvation cannot be made sure; much good do it them, with their sorry
and heartless doctrine! If they make that impossible to any which God
hath made easy for many, "into their secret let not my soul come." [Gen
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#006.md). Observe, 2. That the best saints
have desired to make their salvation sure. David that knew it, yet
entreats to know it more. "I know thou favourest me" ([Psa
41:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#011).md); yet here still, dic animae,
"Say unto my soul, I am thy salvation." A man can never be too sure of
his going to heaven. - Thomas Adams.

[Psa 35:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#003.md)

"Say unto my soul." 1. God may speak with his own voice; and thus he
gave assurance to Abraham, "Fear not, I am thy shield, and thy exceeding
great reward." [Gen 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#001.md). If God speak
comfort, let hell roar horror. 2. He may speak by his works: actual
mercies to us demonstrate that we are in his favour, and shall not be
condemned. "By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy
doth not triumph over me." 3. He may speak by his Son. "Come unto me,
all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." [Mat
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028.md). 4. He may speak by his
Scripture; this is God's epistle to us, and his letters patent, wherein
are granted to us all the privileges of salvation. A universal si quis;
"Whosoever believes, and is baptised, shall be saved." 5. He may speak
by his ministers, to whom he hath given "the ministry of
reconciliation." [Co2 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019.md). 6. He doth
speak this by his Spirit: he "sendeth forth the Spirit of his Son into
our hearts, crying, Abba, Father." [Gal
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006.md). By all these voices God says to
his elect, "I am your salvation." ..."My." There is no vexation to the
vexation of the soul; so no consolation to the consolation of the
soul.... Let this teach us to make much of this "My." Luther says there
is great divinity in pronouns. The assurance that God will save some is
a faith incident to devils. The very reprobates may believe that there
is a book of election; but God never told them that their names were
written there. The hungry beggar at the feast-house gate smells good
cheer, but the master doth not say, "This is provided for thee." It is
small comfort to the harbourless wretch to pass through a goodly city,
and see many glorious buildings, when he cannot say, Haec mea domus, I
have a place here. The beauty of that excellent city Jerusalem, built
with sapphires, emeralds, chrysolites, and such precious stones, the
foundation and walls whereof are perfect gold (Rev. 21), affords a soul
no comfort, unless he can say, Mea civitas, I have a mansion in it. The
all-sufficient merits of Christ do thee no good, unless, tua pars et
portio, he be thy Saviour. Happy soul that can say with the Psalmist, "O
Lord, thou art my portion!" Let us all have oil in our lamps, lest if we
be then to buy, beg, or borrow, we be shutout of doors like the fools,
not worthy of entrance. Pray, "Lord, say unto my soul, I am thy
salvation." ... Who? What? To whom? When? Who? The Lord! To the Lord
David prays. He hath made a good choice, for there is salvation in none
other. "Thou hast destroyed thyself, but in me is thy help." [Hos
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#009.md). The world fails, the flesh
fails, the devil kills. Only the Lord saves what? Salvation. A special
good thing; every man's desire. I will give thee a lordship, saith God
to Esau. I will give thee a kingdom, saith God to Saul. I will give thee
an apostleship, saith God to Judas. But, I will be thy salvation, he
says to David, and to none but saints. To whom? "My salvation." Not
others only, but "thine." A man and a Christian are two creatures. He
may be a man that hath reason and outward blessings; he is only a
Christian that hath faith, and part in the salvation of Christ. God is
plentiful salvation, but it is not ordinary to find a cui - to whom.
Much of heaven is lost for lack of a hand to apprehend it when? In the
present, "I am." Sum, non sufficit quod ero. It is comfort to Israel in
captivity that God says, Ero tua redemptio, I will redeem thee; but the
assurance that quiets the conscience is this, "I am thy salvation." As
God said to Abraham, "Fear not, I am with thee." Deferred hope faints
the heart. Whatsoever God forbears to assure us of, oh, pray we him not
to delay this, "Lord, say to our souls, I am your salvation." -
Condensed from Thomas Adams.

[Psa 35:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#004.md)

"Let them be confounded and put to shame." Here David beginneth his
imprecations, which yet, saith Theodoret, he doth not utter as cursing,
but as prophesying rather. If we shall at any time take upon us thus to
imprecate (as we may in some cases), we must see to it, first, that our
cause be good; secondly, that we do it not out of private revenge, but
merely for the glory of God; thirdly, that we utter not a syllable this
way, but by the guidance of God's good Spirit. - John Trapp.

[Psa 35:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#004.md), [Psa
35:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#026.md)

How are we to account for such prayers for vengeance? We find them
chiefly in four Psalms, the seventh, thirty-fifth, sixty-ninth, and
one-hundred and ninth, and the imprecations in these for in a terrible
climax. In the last no less than thirty anathemas have been counted. Are
these the mere outbursts of passionate and unsanctified feeling, or are
they the legitimate expression of a righteous indignation? Are they to
be excused as being animated by the "spirit of Elias?" a spirit not
unholy indeed, but far removed from the meekness and gentleness of
Christ; or are they the stereotyped forms in which the spirit of
devotion may utter itself? Are they Jewish only, or may they be
Christian also? An uninstructed fastidiousness, it is well known, has
made many persons recoil from reading these Psalms at all. Many have
found their lips falter when they have been called to join in using them
in the congregation, and have either uttered them with bated breath and
doubting heart, or have interpreted them in a sense witlely at variance
with the letter. Some have tried to reconcile them with a more
enlightened conscience, by regarding such words not as the expression of
a wish, but as the utterance of a prediction; the Hebrew optative, which
is distinct enough from the simple future, absolutely forbids this
expedient. Others again would see in them expressions which may lawfully
be used in the soul's wrestling against spiritual enemies. And finally,
some would defend them as utterances of righteous zeal for God's honour,
and remind us that if we do not sympathise with such zeal, it may be not
because our religion is more pure, but because our hearts are colder.

Now the real source of the difficulty lies in our not observing and
bearing in mind the essential difference between the Old Testament and
the New. The older dispensation was in every sense a sterner one than
the new. The spirit of Elias, though not an evil spirit, was not the
spirit of Christ. "The Son of Man came not to destroy men's lives, but
to save them." [Luk 9:56](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#056.md). And through
him his disciples are made partakers of the same spirit. But this was
not the spirit of the older economy. The Jewish nation had been trained
in a sterner school. It had been steeled and hardened by the discipline
which had pledged it to a war of extermination with idolaters: and
however necessary such a discipline might be, it would not tend to
foster the gentler virtues; it is conceivable how even a righteous man,
under it, feeling it to be his bounden duty to root out evil wherever he
saw it, and identifying, as he did, his own enemies with the enemies of
Jehovah, might use language which to us appears unnecessarily
vindictive. To men so trained and taught, what we call "religious
toleration," was a thing not only wrong, but absolutely inconceivable.

It may be quite true that we find revenge forbidden as directly in the
Old Testament as in the New, as, for instance, in [Lev
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018.md), "Thou shalt not avenge," etc.,
though even there there is a limitation, "against the children of thy
people." And it maybe no less true that we find instances of imprecation
in the New; as when St. Paul says ([Ti2
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#014).md), "Alexander the coppersmith did
me much evil; the Lord reward him according to his works," or when he
exclaims ([Act 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#003).md), "God will smite
thee, thou whited wall;" or, "If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ,
let him be anathema." But even these expressions are very different from
the varied, deliberate, carefully-constructed, detailed anathemas of the
Psalms. And our Lord's denunciations, to which Hengstenberg refers, are
in no way parallel. They are not curses upon individuals, but in fact
solemn utterances of the great truth, "Except ye repent, ye shall all
likewise perish." But after all, whatever may be said of particular
passages, the general tone which runs through the two covenants, is
unquestionably different. To deny this is not to honour Moses, but to
dishonour Christ. [Mat 5:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#043.md); [Mat
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#008.md). On the other hand, we must not
forget that these imprecations are not the passionate longing for
personal revenge. The singer undoubtedly sees in his enemies the enemies
of God and his church. They that are not with him are against God. And
because the zeal of God's house even consumes him, he prays that all the
doers of iniquity may be rooted out. The indignation therefore is
righteous, though it may appear to us wrongly directed, or excessive in
its utterance.

Once more, the very fact that a dark cloud hid God's judgment in the
world to come from the view of the Old Testament saints, may be alleged
in excuse of this their desire to see him take vengeance on his enemies
here. How deeply the problem of God's righteousness exercised their
minds, is abundantly evident from numerous places in the Psalms. They
longed to see that righteousness manifested. It could be manifested,
they thought, only in the evident exaltation of the righteous, and the
evident destruction of the wicked here. Hence, with their eye always
fixed on temporal recompense, they could even wish and pray for the
destruction of the ungodly. The awful things of the world to come were
to a great extent hid from their eyes. Could they have seen these, then
surely their prayer would have been not, "Let the angel of the Lord
persecute them," "Blot them out of thy book;" but rather with him who
hung upon the cross; "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they
do." - J. J. Stewart Perowne.

[Psa 35:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#004.md), [Psa
35:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#008.md), [Psa
35:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#026.md)

David was about as devoid of vindictiveness as any public character who
can well be named. His conduct in relation to Saul, from first to last
displayed a singularly noble spirit, far removed from anything like the
lust of vengeance; and the meekness with which he endured the bitter
reproaches of Shimei, bore witness to the same spirit after his
accession to the throne.

When David's whole career is intelligently and fairly reviewed, it
leaves on the mind the impression of a man possessed of as meek and
placable a temper as was ever associated with so great strength of will,
and such strong passions. Even in the heats of sudden resentment, he was
not apt to be hurried into deeds of revenge. Such being the case, it
would certainly have been a strange and unaccountable thing if he had
shown himself less the master of his own spirit in unaccountable thing
if he had shown himself less the master of his own spirit in poems
composed in season of retirement and communion with God, especially
since these very poems express a keen sense of the heinousness of the
sin that has been laid to his charge. He can affirm regarding his
implacable enemies, "As for me, when they were sick, my clothing was
sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into
mine own bosom. I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or
brother' I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother."
[Psa 35:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#013.md), [Psa
35:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#014.md). "O Lord, my God, if I have done
this; if there be iniquity in my hands; if I have rewarded evil unto him
that was at peace with me (yea, I have delivered him that without cause
is mine enemy): let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let
him tread down my life upon the earth." [Psa
7:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#003.md). Surely one ought to think twice
before putting on the imprecations an interpretation which would make
them utterly incongruous with these appeals, uttered almost in the same
breath. - William Binnie, D.D.

[Psa 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#005.md)

"As chaff." Literally, "As the thistledown." - John Morison.

[Psa 35:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#006.md)

"Let their way be dark and slippery." A horrible way! Darkness alone who
feareth not? A slippery way alone who avoids not? In a dark and slippery
way, how shalt thou go? where set foot? These two ills are the great
punishments of men-darkness, ignorance; a slippery way, luxury. "Let
their way be darkness and slipping; and let the angel of the Lord
persecute them," that they be not able to stand. For anyone in a dark
and slippery way, when he seeth that if he move his foot he will fall,
and there is no light before his feet, haply resolving to wait until
light come; but here is the angel of the Lord persecuting them. -
Augustine.

[Psa 35:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#006.md)

"Slippery." Margin, as in Heb., slipperiness. This is a circumstance
which adds increased terror to the image. It is not only a dark road,
but a road made slippery by rains; a road where they are in danger every
moment of sliding down a precipice where they will be destroyed. -
Albert Barnes.

[Psa 35:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#007.md)

"They hid for me their net in a pit." As if David had said that they had
dug a pit, and covered and hid its mouth with a net, that I might pass
upon it and fall into it. - Kimchi.

[Psa 35:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#008.md)

"Let destruction come upon him at unawares." Or a storm, such as is
caused in the Eastern countries by a south wind, very sudden, violent,
and destructive. - John Gill.

[Psa 35:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#008.md)

"Let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction
let him fall." By giving Ahithophel rope enough, the Lord preserved
David from perishing. Who will not admire that Goliath should be slain
with his own sword, and that proud Haman should hold Mordecai's stirrup,
and be the herald of his honour? The wicked shall be undone by their own
doings; all the arrows that they shoot at the righteous shall fall upon
their own pates. Maxentius built a false bridge to drown Constantine,
but was drowned himself. Henry the Third of France was stabbed in the
very same chamber where he had helped to contrive the cruel massacre of
the French Protestants. And his brother, Charles the Ninth, who
delighted in the blood of the saints, had blood given him to drink, for
he was worthy. It is usual with God to take persecutors in the snares
and pits that they have laid for his people, as many thousands in this
nation have experienced; and though Rome and her confederates are this
day a-laying of snares and traps and a-digging of pits for the
righteous, who will rather burn than bow to their Baal, yet do but wait
and weep, and weep and wait a little, and you shall see that the Lord
will take them in the very snares and pits that they have laid and
digged for his people. - Condensed from Thomas Brooks.

[Psa 35:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#008.md)

"Let his net that he hath hid catch himself." Thou fool, who opposest
thy counsels to those of the Most High. He who devises evil for another,
falls at last into his own pit, and the most cunning finds himself
caught by what he had prepared for another. But virtue without guile,
erect like the lofty palm, rises with greater rigour when it is
oppressed. - Pietro Metastasio, 1698-1782.

[Psa 35:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#009.md)

"And my soul shall be joyful in the Lord," etc. While some ascribe to
fortune, and others to their own skill, the praise of their deliverance
from danger, and few, if any, yield the whole praise of it to God, David
here declares that he will not forget the favour which God had bestowed
upon him. My soul, says he, shall rejoice, not in a deliverance of the
author of which it is ignorant, but in the salvation of God. To place
the matter in a still stronger light, he assigns to his very bones the
office of declaring the divine glory. As if not content that his tongue
should be employed in this, he applies all the members of his body to
the work of setting forth the praises of God. The style of speaking
which he employs is hyperbolical, but in this way he shows unfeignedly
that his love to God was so strong that he desired to spend his sinews
and bones in declaring the reality and truth of his devotion. - John
Calvin.

[Psa 35:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#010.md)

"All my bones," etc. These words contain the most vivid description of
the highest delight which by the whole soul and body should be
experienced and openly manifested. He mentions his soul ([Psa
35:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#009).md) and all his bones as about to
take part in the joy, to indicate that he most heartily and with his
whole body was about to rejoice, and that the joy which he would
manifest would not be of an ordinary character, but of the highest
order, so that each several bone should sing forth the praises of God. -
Hermon Venema, 1697-1787.

[Psa 35:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#010.md)

"All my bones." In the Scriptures emotions are generally ascribed to the
viscera, the bones are usually regarded as passive; in this place and
[Psa 51:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#008.md), and in these two places
only, exulting joy is attributed to the bones. Ordinary experience shows
us that the intestines have sympathy with our passionate excitements,
but we have no consciousness of the bones becoming sympathetically
sensitive. The expression therefore is highly poetical, and indicates
that the joy intended would be far beyond ordinary and common delight;
it would be so profound that even the most callous part of the human
frame would partake of it. Doubtless the poetry has a basis of truth in
it, for though we may not perceive it, there is most assuredly a true
and real sympathy with our mental states in every particle of bone and
muscle, as well as in those tender organs which are more apparently
affected. - C. H. S. Thoughts suggested by a passage in "Biblical
Psychology," by Franz Delitzsch.

[Psa 35:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#010.md)

"All my bones." That is, whatsoever strength and rigour is in me it
shall be spent in celebrating thy praises. Or, although I have nothing
left me but skin and bones, so poor am I grown, yet I will not be
wanting to the work. - John Trapp.

[Psa 35:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#010.md)

My bones are riving through my skin, and yet all my bones are praising
him. "I said, I am cast out of thy sight, but I will look again towards
thy holy temple." - Thomas Halyburton, 1674-1711.

[Psa 35:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#011.md)

"They laid to my charge things that I knew not." You will say, Why does
God permit wicked people to lay to the charge of the godly such things
as they are clear of? God if he pleased could prevent it, and stop the
mouths of the wicked, that they should not be able to speak against his
children? Answer - As all things work for the best to them that love
God, so this works for the good of God's people. God doth permit it for
the good of his people, and thus he frustrates the hopes of the wicked:
they intend evil against the godly, and God disposes of it for good. As
Joseph said to his brethren, "You intended evil against me, and God
disposed of it for good;" so we may say to such as falsely slander God's
people, You intended evil against the people of God, but God disposes of
it for good. There is a fivefold good that God brings out of it to his
people. First, God doth by this means humble them, and brings them to
examine what is amiss; so that though they be clear of that crime laid
to their charge, yet they will then examine whether there be nothing
else amiss betwixt God and them; they will search their hearts, and walk
more humbly, and cleave more close to the Lord. Secondly, God doth by
this means bring them oftener upon their knees, to seek unto him, to
plead their cause, and to clear their innocency. How oft did the prophet
speak unto God when the wicked did falsely accuse him; how did he make
his moan at the throne of grace unto God, beseeching him to plead his
cause, and to keep him close in his way, that the wicked might not
rejoice at his downfall! So when God's people see that it is that which
the wicked would have, that which is their joy, to see the godly fall
into such and such a sin; then the godly will pray more earnestly with
David, Lord, lead me in a right path because of my observers; then they
will be earnest with God to keep them from falling into that sin that
the wicked desire they might fall into; and this is a second good that
comes of it. Thirdly, God doth use the reproach of the wicked as a
preventing medicine against that crime which the wicked lay to their
charge. The godly have unrenewed nature as well as renewed, and if God
should leave them never so little to themselves, they are not their own
keepers, they might fall into that sin which the wicked lay to their
charge: and every godly man and woman may say when they are falsely
accused, It is God's mercy that I did not fall into that sin that lay to
my charge. God doth use wicked people's tongues as a warning against
such a sin, that when they see how the wicked joy at a brat of their own
hatching, then they consider, if the wicked thus joy without a cause,
what would they do if they had just cause? Well, by the help of God this
shall be a warning to me for ever to watch against that sin: for the
time to come I will pray more against that particular sin than I have
done, and watch more against that sin than I have done; through God's
help they shall never have occasion to rejoice over me in that kind.
Truly, I verily believe many a child of God can say by experience, I
never should have prayed and watched against such a sin so much, had not
God used the tongues of the wicked as preventing physic: I knew not my
own heart, but that I might have fallen into such and such a sift had
not God by this means hedged up my way with thorns; and this is the
third good comes of it. Fourthly, God doth by this means exercise the
graces of his people by letting them undergo bad report as well as good
report: he tries whether they will cleave close to him in all
conditions, as [Psa 44:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#015.md). Fifthly,
God doth by this means teach them how to judge of others when they are
falsely accused. For the time to come they will not receive a false
report against their neighbour; they will know the truth of a thing
before they believe it, and they know how to comfort others in the like
condition; and thus God disposes of it for good, and thus God makes the
wicked the servant of his people in that very thing which the wicked
think to wrong them most in; for he uses the wicked as the rod and wisp,
to scour off the rust of their graces and to correct their security; and
when the rod hath done its office then it is thrown into the fire: and
thus you see how God disposes of the wicked's false accusations of his
people for good. - Zephaniah Smyth's Sermon, "The Malignant's Plot,"
1647.

[Psa 35:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#012.md)

"They rewarded me evil for good." For the good David did in killing
Goliath, and slaying his ten thousands of the Philistines, and thereby
saving his king and country, Saul and his courtiers envied him, and
sought to slay him; so our Lord Jesus Christ, for all the good he did to
the Jews, by healing their bodies of diseases, and preaching the gospel
to them for the benefit of their souls, was rewarded with reproaches and
persecutions, and at last with the shameful death of the cross; and in
like manner are his people used, but this is an evil that shall not go
unpunished; see [Pro 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#013.md). - John
Gill.

[Psa 35:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#012.md)

"To the spoiling of my soul." They robbed not his body of goods but his
soul of consolation. They bereaved his soul (that is the word), like a
widow who loses her children in whom she delighted and found succour.
They were not content with injuring his estate, but they were for
ruining the man himself by their undeserved malice, they attacked him in
name and reputation, which were as dear to him as his sons and
daughters, or even as his soul. It is evermore an injury to the soul to
be attacked with slander, it puts a man into a warring attitude,
endangers his peace of mind, imperils his enjoyment of quiet
contemplation, and tends to interrupt his communion with God. Thus the
spiritual nature is despoiled and suffers bereavement. - C. H. S.

[Psa 35:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#013.md)

"My prayer returned into, or was directed to, my bosom." Of the many
interpretations that are given of this passage, that appears to me the
most probable which derives it from the posture of the worshipper; who
standing with his head inclined downward toward his bosom, turned away
his attention from all external objects, and uttered his mournful and
earnest requests, as if they were directed to his own bosom. Such a
posture of devotion is in use both among Jews and Mohammedans. - Koehler
in Reporter. Lit. Orient.; and Reland de Relig. Mohammedica, quoted by
Walford in loc.

[Psa 35:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#013) (last clause.md)

We may read it thus: Let my prayer return into my bosom; that is, I
wished no worse to them than to myself: let me receive of God such good
as I prayed for them. See [Psa 79:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#012.md).
- Henry Ainsworth.

[Psa 35:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#014.md)

"For his mother." On account of the plurality of wives in an Eastern
household, the sons are usually far more attached to their mother than
their father. Their father they share with a numerous band of
half-brothers, who are envious of them, or of whom they are jealous, but
their mother is all their own, with her they are brought up in
childhood; she takes their part in youth, in the numerous battles of the
harem; and on their part when they are grown up, they love her
intensely, and hence their mourning at her decease is of the bitterest
kind. - C.H.S.

[Psa 35:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#014.md)

"His mother." Mahomet was once asked what relation had the strongest
claim upon our affection and respect; when he instantly replied, "The
mother, the mother, the mother."

[Psa 35:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#014) (last clause.md)

Bewaileth his mother: mourneth at her funeral. In this case the
affections are most strong. Therefore the priests were permitted to
mourn for such. [Lev 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#001.md), [Lev
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#002.md), [Lev
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#003.md). - Henry Ainsworth.

[Psa 35:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#015.md)

"But in mine adversity they rejoiced," etc. - Do not glory in your
neighbour's ruins. The fire-fly leaps and dances in the fire, and so do
many wicked men rejoice in the sufferings of others. Such as rejoice in
the sufferings of others are sick of the devil's disease; but from that
disease the Lord deliver all your souls. 'Tis sad to insult over those
whom God hath humbled; 'tis high wickedness to triumph over those to
whom God hath given a cup of astonishment to drink. Such as make the
desolations of their neighbours to be the matter either of their secret
repast, or open exultation, such may fear that the very dregs of divine
wrath are reserved for them. 'Tis bad playing upon the harp because
others have been put to hang their harps upon the willows. We must not
pray with him in the tragedy, but it may rain calamities; nor with
Clemens' Gnostic, Give me calamities that I may glory in them. There
cannot be a greater evidence of a wicked heart, than for a man to be
merry because others are in misery. "He that is glad at calamities (that
is, at the calamities of others) shall not be unpunished." [Pro
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#005.md). If God be God, such as
congratulate our miseries instead of condoling them, shall be sure to be
punished with the worst of punishments; for such do not only sin against
the law of grace, but also against the very law of nature; the law of
nature teaching men to sympathise with those that are in misery, and not
to rejoice over them because of their miseries. O, sirs, do not make
others' mourning your music, do not make others' tears your wine; as you
would not be made drunk at last with the wine of astonishment. - Thomas
Brooks.

[Psa 35:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#015.md)

"But in mine adversity they rejoiced," etc. Marvellous prophecy of the
cross! second only, if indeed second, to that in the twenty-second
Psalm. Still closer to the history if we take the Vulgate: the scourges
were gathered together upon me. Even so, O Lord Jesus, the ploughers
ploughed upon thy back, and made long furrows: precious furrows for us,
where are sown patience for the present life, and glory in the next;
where are sown hope that maketh not ashamed, and love that many waters
cannot quench. "The very abjects." Even those worst of abjects, who
said, "God, I thank thee that I am not as other men are;" who had set
the poor sinner before the Lord, with their "Moses in the law commanded
that such should be stoned." "Making mouths at me." And is it not
wonderful that, well knowing the prophecy, yet the chief priests and
scribes should have so fulfilled it, as that it should be written
concerning them. "They that passed by mocked him, wagging their heads"?
- Lewis de Grenada, 1504-1588.

[Psa 35:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#015.md)

"In mine adversity they rejoiced." Now, as men often relent at seeing
the misfortunes of their enemies, so that they cease to hate or
persecute those who are already miserably wretched, it was all evidence
of the very cruel and fierce spirit by which David's former friends were
actuated against him, when, upon seeing him cast down and afflicted,
they were rather by this incited furiously and insolently to assail him.
- John Calvin.

[Psa 35:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#015.md)

"The abjects." The very abjects (Prayer Book Version). The Hebrew word
Nechim, thus translated, comes from a verb signifying to be smitten.
Hence, in the Septuagint it is rendered scourges. But it may also be
rendered, with Jerome, smiters, and may mean smitten with the tongue.
Com. [Jer 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#018.md). Another of its
meanings is, according to Buxtorf, the wry-legged, the lame; and so it
is used in [Sa2 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#004.md); [Sa2
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#003.md); whence the epithet of Necho was
given to one of the Pharaohs who halted in his gait. Our translators
seem to have understood the word in this last sense, as a term of
contempt. - Daniel Cresswell.

[Psa 35:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#015.md)

David, having showed how compassionate he was to his enemies in their
affliction ([Psa 35:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#014).md), he presently
shows ([Psa 35:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#015).md), how
incompassionate, or barbarously cruel rather, his enemies were to him in
his. "Abjects" are vile persons, men smitten in their estates and
credits; yea, often as slaves or ill servants smitten with cudgels or
whips. So a learned translator renders the Psalm, The smitten gathered
against me; that is, vile men who deserve to be beaten and cudgelled. -
Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 35:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#016.md)

"With hypocritical mockers in feasts." Some cannot be merry, but it must
be with Scripture; if they want a little diversion, the saints must be
the subject of their discourse! they can vent their profane jests upon
the word of God; this is their pastime over their cups upon the
ale-bench. How ready they are with their contumelious reflections; they
have learnt their father's dialect, they are accusers of the brethren,
their speech bewrays them to be Hellians. You know that in ordinary, we
can tell what countryman a person is by his speech, every country having
almost a peculiar idiom; so it is here, these scoffers at religion by
speaking the language of hell, let us understand whence they are. They
have, it may be, a little wit, which they set off with a sort of an air
in rhetorical raillery, and oh, how quick and sharp when they are upon
this subject! These scoffing Ishmaelites are seated in the devil's
chair, somewhat above their brethren in iniquity, as most deserving the
place; and there is less ground to hope that such persons will be
savingly wrought upon who arrive to such a height in sin as to make a
mock of it, and to sport with holiness, than of others. Persons are got
a great way towards hell when they mock at what is serious, and that
with delight. This the Lord will visit for in his due time; for he knows
who they are that so dishonour him by reproaching them that are his. -
Oliver Heftwood.

[Psa 35:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#016.md)

"Hypocritical mockers in feasts." בּהגפי לעגי מעוג. Very difficult. The
word מעוג, in [Kg1 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#012.md), the only
other passage where it occurs, means "a cake." Hence לעגי מעוג is
interpreted by Gesenius and other to mean, hangers-on at the tables of
the rich (lit. "cake-mockers ") whose business it was, by witticisms and
buffoonery to make entertainment for the guests, and who got their
dinner in return, like the Gr ψωμοκόλακες, κνισοκόλακες, and the Medley.
Lat buccellarii. Then the words would mean, "Amongst the profanest." -
J. J. Stewart Perowne. \[Would not our word loafers be somewhat
analogous to these cake-eaters of antiquity!\] - C. H. S.

[Psa 35:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#016.md)

"Hypocritical mockers." David aggravates the sin of those jeering
companions who made him their table-talk, and could not taste their
cheer except seasoned with some salt jest quibbled out at him, with
this, that they were "hypocritical mockers;" they did it slily, and
wrapped up their scoffs, it is like in such language as might make some
think, who did not well observe them, that they applauded him. There is
a way of commending which some have learned to use when they mean to
cast the greatest scorn upon those they hate bitterly, and these
hypocritical mockers deserve the chair to be given them from all other
scorners. - William Gurnall.

[Psa 35:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#016.md)

"Mockers in feasts." If it were known at a feast that there was any one
present or absent, whom the host disliked, it was customary for the
guests to "make fun of them," and use sarcastic language respecting
them. These are the "hypocritical mockers in feasts." - John Gadsby.

[Psa 35:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#017.md)

Satan no sooner spies our wanderings, but he presently runs with a
complaint to God, filing bills against us in the star-chamber of heaven,
where the matter would go hard with us, but for the Great Lord
Chancellor of peace, our Advocate Jesus Christ. As God keeps all our
tears in a bottle, and registereth the very groans of our holy passion
in a book, so Satan keeps a record of our sins, and solicits justice
against us. Were God like man, subject to passions, or incensible by the
suggestions of the common barrator, woe were us. But he will hear one
son of truth before ten thousand fathers of lying. No matter what the
plaintiff libelleth, when the judge acquitteth. We have forfeited our
estates by treason, and the busy devil begs us; but there is one that
steps in, and pleads a former grant, and that both by promise and
purchase. "Lord, rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from
the lions." Lord Jesus, challenge thine own; let not Satan enter upon by
force or fraud, what thou hast bought with thine own blood. - Thomas
Adams.

[Psa 35:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#017.md)

"My darling." In Poole's Synopsis the critics explain this name for the
soul, as my only one, my solitary one, desolate, deserted, and destitute
of human hope. Such is the soul under sore affliction. See [Psa
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#021.md). "From the lions." Daniel in the
den was literally where David was spiritually. Shut in among fierce,
cruel, and angry creatures, and himself defenceless, having no weapon
but prayer, no helper but the Lord. The people of God may be exposed to
the lions of hell, and their roarings may grievously affright them; but
the soul which is their "darling" is also God's dear one, and therefore
they shall be rescued. - C.H.S.

[Psa 35:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#019.md)

"Wink with the eye." Showing pleasure in their eyes because of my evil.
- Francis Vatablus. 1545.

[Psa 35:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#019.md)

"Wink the eye." This was a sign which malicious persons made to each
other when the object of their malice was gained, scornfully twisting
their eyes together. The Hebrew word here has no sufficiently expressive
substitute in English. - Benjamin Weiss.

[Psa 35:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#021.md)

"Our eye hath seen." Eye for eyes, unless we would say that all the
wicked are so conjoined, that they may seem to have but one eye, heart,
head. - John Trapp.

[Psa 35:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#021.md)

Yet, O ye saints, divulge not these things to wicked men; whisper them
softly one to another, with fear and trembling, lest some profane wretch
or other overhear you, and take that for encouragement that was only
meant for caution. What is more common than for the vilest sinners to
plead for their excuse, or warrant rather, the foul miscarriages of
God's dearest saints? Thus the drunkard looks upon holy Noah as a
pot-companion, whereby he discovers his nakedness in a worse sense than
ever Cham did; and thus the unclean sensualist quotes David, and calls
him in to be the patron of his debauchery. Certainly, if there be any
grief that can overcast the perfect joys of the saints in heaven, it is
that their names and examples should, to the great dishonour of God, be
produced by wicked and sinful men, to countenance their grossest sins
and wickednesses. But let such know, that God hath set up these in his
church to be monuments of his mercy, to declare to humble and penitent
sinners how great sins he can pardon; yet if any hereupon imbolden
themselves in sin, instead of being set up as monuments of mercy, God
will set them up as pillars of salt. - Ezekiel Hopkins (Bishop).

[Psa 35:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#021.md)

He who rejoices in another's fall rejoices in the devil's victory. -

They gape and drawe their mouthes in scorneful wise,

And erie, fie, fie, wee sawe it with our eyes.

Sir John Davies.

[Psa 35:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#023.md)

"My God and my Lord." The cry of Thomas when he saw the wounds of Jesus.
If he did not count our Lord to be divine, neither does David here
ascribe Deity to Jehovah, for there is no difference except in the order
of the words and the tongue in which they were spoken, the meaning is
identical. What words they are, with their two eyes seeing Jehovah in
two aspects yet as one, grasping him with two hands in the double "my"
to one heart, for the word is but one, bowing before him on both knees
to worship him in lowliest reverence. Well might Nouet, in his
exposition of the words as used by Thomas, exclaim, "Oh, sweet word, I
will say it all my life long; I will say it in the hour of death; I will
say it in eternity." - C. H. S.

[Psa 35:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#024.md)

"O Lord my God." O Jehovah my God; here is another precious word. He
takes Jehovah to be his God, in opposition to those who make idols, or
riches, or their own lusts their god. He claims a full possession of all
that is in the great I am. Even though he views him as a judge he lays
the hand of faith upon his God, and flinches not even before the blaze
of his righteousness. It is a noble word, a grand utterance of faith; he
who can pronounce that word "my" from his inmost soul in such a
connection may well laugh to scorn all his enemies. - C.H.S.

[Psa 35:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#025.md)

"Let them not say we have swallowed him up." And even if they could,
like Jonah's whale, they would soon be sickened of their feast. A living
child of God were more easily swallowed than digested by the malice of
hell. - C.H.S.

[Psa 35:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#027.md)

See how the hearts of the saints have been drawn out against their
persecutors. Prayers are the arms that in times of persecution the
saints have still had recourse to. The Romans being in great distress
were put so hard to it, that they were fain to take the weapons out of
the temples of their gods to right with their enemies, and so they
overcame them: so when the people of God have been hard put to it by
reason of afflictions and persecutions, the weapons that they have fled
to have been prayers and tears, and with these they have overcome their
persecutors. - Thomas Brooks.

[Psa 35:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#028.md)

"My tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the
day long." See now I have made a discourse something longer; ye are
wearied. Who endureth to praise God all the day long? I will suggest a
remedy whereby thou mayest praise God all the day long if thou wilt.
Whatever thou dost, do well, and thou hast praised God. When thou
singest a hymn, thou praisest God, but what doth thy tongue, unless thy
heart also praise him? Hast thou ceased from singing hymns, and departed
that thou mayest refresh thyself? Be not drunken, and thou hast praised
God. Dost thou go away to sleep? Rise not to do evil, and thou hast
praised God. Dost thou transact business? Do no wrong, and thou hast
praised God. Dost thou till thy field? Raise not strife, and thou hast
praised God. In the innocency of thy works prepare thyself to praise God
all the day long. - Augustine.

[Psalms 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 35:1</span></span>

1 Plead my cause, O Lord, with them that strive with me: fight against
them that fight against me.

2 Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.

3 Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that persecute
me: say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.

4 Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let
them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.

5 Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the Lord
chase them.

6 Let their way be dark and slippery; and let the angel of the Lord
persecute them.

7 For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit, which
without cause they have digged for my soul.

8 Let destruction come upon him at unawares: and let his net that he
hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall.

9 And my soul shall be joyful in the Lord: it shall rejoice in his
salvation.

10 All my bones shall say, Lord, who is like unto thee, which deliverest
the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the
needy from him that spoileth him?

[Psa 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#001.md)

"Plead my cause, O Lord, with them that strive with me." Plead against
those who plead against me; strive with my strivers; contend with my
contenders. If they urge their suit in the law-court, Lord, meet them
there, and beat them at their own weapons. Every saint of God shall have
this privilege: the accuser of the brethren shall be met by the Advocate
of the saints. "Fight against them that fight against me." If my
adversaries try force as well as fraud, be a match for them; oppose thy
strength to their strength. Jesus does this for all his beloved - for
them he is both intercessor and champion; whatever aid they need they
shall receive from him, and in whatever manner they are assaulted they
shall be effectually defended. Let us not fail to leave our case into
the Lord's hand. Vain is the help of man, but ever effectual is the
interposition of heaven. What is here asked for as a boon, may be
regarded as a promise, to all the saints; in judgment they shall have a
divine advocate, in warfare a divine protection.

[Psa 35:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#002.md)

"Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help." In vivid
metaphor the Lord is pictured as coming forth armed for battle, and
interposing himself between his servant and his enemies. The greater and
lesser protections of providence may be here intended by the two
defensive weapons, find by the Lord's standing up is meant his active
and zealous preservation of his servant in the perilous hour. This
poetic imagery shows how the Psalmist realised the existence and power
of God; and thought of him as a real and actual personage, truly working
for his afflicted.

[Psa 35:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#003.md)

"Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that persecute
me." Before the enemy comes to close quarters the Lord can push them off
as with a long spear. To stave off trouble is no mean act of
lovingkindness. As when some valiant warrior with his lance blocks up a
defile, and keeps back a host until his weaker brethren have made good
their escape, so does the Lord often hold the believer's foes at bay
until the good man has taken breath, or clean fled from his foes. He
often gives the foes of Zion some other work to do, and so gives rest to
his church. What a glorious idea is this of Jehovah blocking the way of
persecutors, holding them at the pike's end, and giving time for the
hunted saint to elude their pursuit! "Say unto my soul, I am thy
salvation." Besides holding off the enemy the Lord can also calm the
mind of his servant by express assurance from his own mouth, that he is,
and shall be, safe under the Almighty wing. An inward persuasion of
security in God is of all things the most precious in the furnace of
persecution. One word from the Lord quiets all our fears.

[Psa 35:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#004.md)

"Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul." There
is nothing malicious here, the slandered man simply craves for justice,
and the petition is natural and justifiable. Guided by God's good spirit
the Psalmist foretells the everlasting confusion of all the haters of
the righteous. Shameful disappointment shall be the portion of the
enemies of the gospel, nor would the most tender-hearted Christian have
it otherwise: viewing sinners as men, we love them and seek their good,
but regarding them as enemies of God, we cannot think of them with
anything but detestation, and a loyal desire for the confusion of their
devices. No loyal subject can wish well to rebels. Squeamish
sentimentality may object to the strong language here used, but in their
hearts all good men wish confusion to mischief-makers.

[Psa 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#005.md)

"Let them be as chaff before the wind." They were swift enough to
attack, let them be as swift to flee. Let their own fears and the alarms
of their consciences unman them so that the least breeze of trouble
shall carry them hither and thither. Ungodly men are worthless in
character, and light in their behaviour, being destitute of solidity and
fixedness; it is but just that those who make themselves chaff should be
treated as such. When this imprecation is fulfilled in graceless men,
they will find it an awful thing to be for ever without rest, without
peace of mind, or stay of soul, hurried from fear to fear, and from
misery to misery. "And let the angel-of the Lord chase them." Fallen
angels shall haunt them, good angels shall afflict them. To be pursued
by avenging spirits will be the lot of those who delight in persecution.
Observe the whole scene as the Psalmist sketches it: the furious foe is
first held at bay, then turned back, then driven to headlong flight, and
chased by fiery messengers from whom there is no escape, while his
pathway becomes dark and dangerous, and his destruction overwhelming.

[Psa 35:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#006.md)

"Let their way be dark and slippery." What terrors are gathered here! No
light, no foothold, and a fierce avenger at their heels! What a doom is
appointed for the enemies of God! They may rage and rave today, but how
altered will be their plight ere long! "And let the angel of the Lord
persecute them." He will follow them hot-foot, as we say, never turning
aside, but like a trusty pursuivant serving the writ of vengeance upon
them, and arresting them in the name of unflinching justice. Woe, woe,
woe, unto those who touch the people of God; their destruction is both
swift and sure.

[Psa 35:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#007.md)

In this verse the Psalmist brings forward the gravamen of his charge
against the servants of the devil. "For without cause" - without my
having injured, assailed, or provoked them; out of their own spontaneous
malice "have they hid for me their net in a pit," even as men hunt for
their game with cunning and deception. Innocent persons have often been
ruined by traps set for them, into which they have fallen as guilelessly
as beasts which stumble into concealed pits, and are taken as in a net.
It is no little thing to be able to feel that the enmity which assails
us is undeserved - uncaused by any wilful offence on our part. Twice
does David assert in one verse that his adversaries plotted against him
"without cause." Net-making and pit-digging require time and labour, and
both of these the wicked will expend cheerfully if they may but
overthrow the people of God. Fair warfare belongs to honourable men, but
the assailants of God's church prefer mean, ungenerous schemes, and so
prove their nature and their origin. We must all of us be on our guard,
for gins and pitfalls are still the favourite weapons of the powers of
evil.

[Psa 35:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#008.md)

"Let destruction come, upon him at unawares." This tremendous
imprecation is frequently fulfilled. God's judgments are often sudden
and signal. Death enter the persecutor's house without pausing to knock
at the door. The thunderbolt of judgment leaps from its hiding-place,
and in one crash the wicked are broken for ever. "And let his net that
he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall."
There is a lex talionis with God which often works most wonderfully. Men
set traps and catch their own fingers. They throw up stones, and they
fall upon their own heads. How often Satan outwits himself, and burns
his fingers with his own coals! This will doubtless be one of the
aggravations of hell, that men will torment themselves with what were
once the fond devices of their rebellious minds. They curse and are
cursed; they kick the pricks and tear themselves; they pour forth floods
of fire, and it burns them within and without.

[Psa 35:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#009.md)

"And my soul shall be joyful in the Lord." Thus rescued, David ascribes
all the honour to the Judge of the right; to his own valorous arm he
offers no sacrifice of boasting. He turns away from his adversaries to
his God, and finds a deep unbroken joy in Jehovah, and in that joy his
spirit revels. "It shall rejoice in his salvation." We do not triumph in
the destruction of others, but in the salvation given to us of God.
Prayer heard should always suggest praise. It were well if we were more
demonstrative in our holy rejoicings. We rob God by suppressing grateful
emotions.

[Psa 35:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#010.md)

As if the tongue were not enough to bless God with, David makes every
limb vocal - "All my bones shall say, Lord, who is like unto thee?" His
whole anatomy he would make resonant with gratitude. Those bones which
were to have been broken by my enemies shall now praise God; every one
of them shall bring its tribute, ascribing unrivalled excellence to
Jehovah the Saviour of his people. Even if worn to skin and bone, yet my
very skeleton shall magnify the Lord, "which deliverest the poor from
him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him
that spoileth him." God is the champion, the true knight-errant of all
oppressed ones. Where there is so much condescension, justice, kindness,
power, and compassion, the loftiest songs should be rendered. Come, dear
reader, have you not been delivered from sin, Satan, and death, and will
not you bless the Redeemer? You were poor and weak, but in due time
Christ sought you, and set you free. O magnify the Lord today, and speak
well of his name.

[Psalms 35:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 35:11</span></span>

11 False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things that I
knew not.

12 They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul.

13 But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I
humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own
bosom.

14 I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: I bowed
down heavily as one that mourneth for his mother.

15 But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves
together: yea, the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and
I knew it not they did tear me, and ceased not:

16 With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their
teeth.

17 Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their
destructions, my darling from the lions.

18 I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee
among much people.

[Psa 35:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#011.md)

"False witnesses did rise up." This is the old device of the ungodly,
and we must not wonder if it be used against us as against our Master.
To please Saul, there were always men to be found mean enough to impeach
David. "they laid to my charge things that I knew not." He had not even
a thought of sedition; he was loyal even to excess; yet they accused him
of conspiring against the Lord's anointed. He was not only innocent, but
ignorant of the fault alleged. It is well when our hands are so clean
that no trace of dirt is upon them.

[Psa 35:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#012.md)

"They rewarded me evil for good." This is devilish; but men have learned
the lesson well of the old Destroyer, and practise it most perfectly.
"To the spoiling of my soul." They robbed him of comfort, and even would
have taken his life had it not been for special rescues from the hand of
God. The wicked would strip the righteous naked to their very soul: they
know no pity. There are only such limits to human malice as God himself
may see fit to place.

[Psa 35:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#013.md)

"But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth." David
had been a man of sympathy; he had mourned when Saul was in ill health,
putting on the weeds of sorrow for him as though he were a near and dear
friend. His heart went into mourning for his sick master. "I humbled my
soul with fasting." He prayed for his enemy, and made the sick man's
case his own, pleading and confessing as if his own personal sin had
brought on the evil. This showed a noble spirit in David, and greatly
aggravated the baseness of those who now so cruelly persecuted him. "And
my prayer returned into mine own bosom." Prayer is never lost: if it
bless not those for whom intercession is made, it shall bless the
intercessors. Clouds do not always descend in showers upon the same spot
from which the vapours ascended, but they come down somewhere; and even
so do supplications in some place or other yield their showers of mercy.
If our dove find no rest for the sole of her foot among our enemies, it
shall fly into our bosoms and bring an olive branch of peace in its
mouth. How sharp is the contrast all through this Psalm between the
righteous and his enemies! We must be earnest to keep the line of
demarcation broad and clear.

[Psa 35:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#014.md)

"I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother:" I waited
on him assiduously, comforted him affectionately, and sympathised with
him deeply. This may refer to those days when David played on the harp,
and chased away the evil spirit from Saul. "I bowed down heavily, as one
that mourneth for his mother. He bowed his head as mourners do. The
strongest natural grief was such as he felt when they were in trouble.
The mother usually wins the deepest love, and her loss is most keenly
felt; such was David's grief. How few professors in these days have such
bowels of compassion; and yet under the gospel there should be far more
tender love than under the law. Had we more hearty love to manhood, and
care for its innumerable ills, we might be far more useful; certainly we
should be infinitely more Christ-like. "He prayeth best that loveth
best."

[Psa 35:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#015.md)

"But in mine adversity they rejoiced." In my halting they were
delighted. My lameness was sport to them. Danger was near, and they sang
songs over my expected defeat. How glad are the wicked to see a good man
limp! "Now," say they, "he will meet with his downfall." "And gathered
themselves together," like kites and vultures around a dying sheep. They
found a common joy in my ruin, and a recreation in my sorrow, and
therefore met together to keep the feast. They laid their heads together
to devise, and their tongues to deceive. "Yea, the abjects gathered
themselves together against me." Those who deserved horsewhipping,
fellows the soles of whose feet were needing the bastinado, came
together to plot, and held hole and corner meetings. Like curs around a
sick lion, the mean wretches taunted and insulted one whose name had
been their terror. The very cripples hobbled out to join the malicious
crew. How unanimous are the powers of evil; how heartily do men serve
the devil; and none decline his service because they are not endowed
with great abilities! "I knew it not." It was all done behind my back.
What a fluster the world may be in, and the cause of it all may not even
know that he has given offence. "They did tear me, and ceased not." It
is such dainty work to tear to pieces a good man's character, that when
slanderers have their hand in they are loath to leave off. A pack of
dogs tearing their prey is nothing compared with a set of malicious
gossips mauling the reputation of a worthy man. That lovers of the
gospel are not at this time rent and torn as in the old days of Mary, is
to be attributed to the providence of God rather than to the gentleness
of men.

[Psa 35:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#016.md)

"With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their
teeth." Like professional buffoons who grin around the banquet to make
sport, so they made a business of jeering at the good man; not, however,
out of mirth, but from violent, insatiable hatred. Like cake-scoffers,
or men who will jeer for a bit of bread, these hireling miscreants
persecuted David in order to get a bellyful for themselves from Saul's
table: having moreover an inward grudge against the son of Jesse because
he was a better man than themselves.

Very forcibly might our Lord have used the words of these verses! Let us
not forget to see the Despised and Rejected of men here painted to the
life. Calvary and the ribald crew around the cross seem brought before
our eyes.

[Psa 35:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#017.md)

"Lord, how long wilt thou look on?" Why be a mere spectator? Why so
neglectful of thy servant? Art thou indifferent? Carest thou not that we
perish? We may thus reason with the Lord. He permits us this
familiarity. There is a time for our salvation, but to our impatience it
often seems to be very slow in coming; yet wisdom has ordained the hour,
and nothing shall delay it. "Rescue my soul from their destructions."
From their many devices; their multiplied assaults, be pleased to set me
free. "My darling," my lovely, only, precious soul, do thou rescue "from
the lions." His enemies were fierce, cunning, and strong as young lions;
God only could deliver him from their jaws, to God he therefore
addresses himself.

[Psa 35:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#018.md)

"I will give thee thanks in the great congregation." Notable
deliverances must be recorded, and their fame emblazoned. All the saints
should be informed of the Lord's goodness. The theme is worthy of the
largest assembly; the experience of a believer is a subject fit for an
assembled universe to hear of. Most men publish their griefs, good men
should proclaim their mercies. "I will praise thee among much people."
Among friends and foes will I glorify the God of my salvation. Praise -
personal praise, public praise, perpetual praise - should be the daily
revenue of the King of heaven. Thus, for the second time, David's prayer
ends in praise, as indeed all prayer should.

[Psalms 35:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 35:19</span></span>

19 Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me:
neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.

20 For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against
them that are quiet in the land.

21 Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha, aha, our
eye hath seen it.

22 This thou hast seen, O Lord: keep not silence: O Lord, be not far
from me.

23 Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause, my God
and my Lord.

24 Judge me, O Lord, my God, according to thy righteousness; and let
them not rejoice over me.

25 Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them
not say, We have swallowed him up.

26 Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at
mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify
themselves against me.

27 Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause:
yea, let them say continually, Let the Lord be magnified, which hath
pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.

28 And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all
the day long.

[Psa 35:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#019.md)

He earnestly prays that as they have no cause for their enmity, they may
have no cause for triumph either in his folly, sin, or overthrow.
"Neither let them wink with the eye that hale me without a cause." The
winking of the eye was the low-bred sign of congratulation at the ruin
of their victim, and it may also have been one of their scornful
gestures as they gazed upon him whom they despised. To cause hatred is
the mark of the wicked, to suffer it causelessly is the lot of the
righteous. God is the natural Protector of all who are wronged, and he
is the enemy of all oppressors.

[Psa 35:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#020.md)

"For they speak not peace." They love it not; how can they speak it?
They are such troublers themselves that they cannot judge others to be
peaceable. Out of the mouth comes what is in the heart. Riotous men
charge others with sedition. "They devise deceitful mailers against them
that are quiet in the land." David would fain have been an orderly
citizen, but they laboured to make him a rebel. He could do nothing
aright, all his dealings were misrepresented. This is an old trick of
the enemy to brand good men with S.S on their cheeks, as sowers of
sedition, though they have ever been a harmless race, like sheep among
wolves. When mischief is meant, mischief is soon made. Unscrupulous
partisans could even charge Jesus with seeking to overturn Caesar, much
more will they thus accuse his household. At this very hour, those who
stand up for the crown rights of King Jesus are called enemies of the
church, favourers of Popery, friends of Atheists, levellers, red
republicans, and it were hard to say what besides. Billingsgate and
Babylon are in league.

[Psa 35:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#021.md)

"Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me." As if they would swallow
him. Uttering great lies which needed wide mouths. They set no bounds to
their infamous charges, but poured out wholesale abuse, trusting that if
all did not stick, some of it would. "And said, Aha, aha, our eye hath
seen it." Glad to find out a fault or a misfortune, or to swear they had
seen evil where there was none. Malice has but one eye; it is blind to
all virtue in its enemy. Eyes can generally see what hearts wish. A man
with a mote in his eye sees a spot in the sun. How like a man is to an
ass when he brays over another's misfortunes! how like to a devil when
he laughs a hyaena-laugh over a good man's slips! Malice is folly, and
when it holds a festival its tones and gestures far exceed all the
freaks and mummeries of the Lord of misrule.

[Psa 35:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#022.md)

"This thou hast seen, O Lord." Here is comfort. Our heavenly Father
knows all our sorrow. Omniscience is the saint's candle which never goes
out. A father will not long endure to see his child abused. Shall not
God avenge his own elect? "Keep not silence." Rebuke thine enemies and
mine, O Lord. A word will do it. Clear my character, comfort my heart.
"O Lord, be not far from me." Walk the furnace with me. Stand in the
pillory at my side. The sweet presence of God is the divine cordial of
the persecuted; his painful absence would be their deepest misery.

[Psa 35:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#023.md)

"Stir up thyself." Be upon thy mettle. Prove that thou art no
indifferent witness to all this infamy. "Awake to rail judgment." Take
the sceptre and summon the great assize; vindicate justice, avenge
oppression. Do not tarry as men do who sleep. "Even unto my cause, my
God and my Lord." He claims a nearness to his God, he holds him with
both hands; he leaves his case with the righteous Judge. He begs that
the suit may be brought on, heard, tried, and verdict given. Well is it
for a man when his conscience is so clear that he dares to make such an
appeal.

[Psa 35:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#024.md)

The appeal is here repeated; the plaintiff feels that the joy of his
accusers will be short-lived as soon as impartial justice rules. The
oppressors' wrong, the proud man's contumely, the fool's grimace - all,
all will cease when the righteous Lord sits down upon the judgment seat.

[Psa 35:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#025.md)

"Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not
say, We have swallowed him up." Disappoint them of their prey when their
mouths are ready to swallow it. Saints are too dear a morsel for the
powers of evil; God will not give his sheep over to the wolfish jaws of
the persecutors. Just when they are tuning their pipes to celebrate
their victory, they shall be made to laugh on the other side of their
mouths. They are all too sure, and too boastful; they reckon without
their host: little do they dream of the end which will be put to their
scheming. Their bird shall be flown, and they themselves shall be in the
trap. The prayer of this text is a promise. Even before the lips of the
wicked can frame a speech of exultation, they shall be disappointed;
their heart-speech shall be forestalled, their wishes frustrated, their
knavish tricks exposed.

[Psa 35:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#026.md)

Here is the eternal result of all the laborious and crafty devices of
the Lord's enemies. God will make little of them, though they "magnified
themselves;" he will shame them for shaming his people, bring them to
confusion for making confusion, pull off their fine apparel and give
them a beggarly suit of dishonour, and turn all their rejoicing into
weeping and wailing, and gnashing of teeth. Truly, the saints can afford
to wait.

[Psa 35:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#027.md)

"Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause."
Even those who could not render him active aid, but in their hearts
favoured him, David would have the Lord reward most abundantly. Men of
tender heart set great store by the good wishes and prayers of the
Lord's people. Jesus also prizes those whose hearts are with his cause.
The day is coming when shouts of victory shall be raised by all who are
on Christ's side, for the battle will turn, and the foes of truth shall
be routed. "Yea, let them say continually, Let the Lord be magnified."
He would have their gladness contributory to the divine glory; they are
not to shout to David's praise, but for the honour of Jehovah. Such
acclamations may fitly be continued throughout time and eternity. "Which
hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant." They recognised David
as the Lord's servant, and saw with pleasure the Lord's favour to him.
We can have no nobler title than "servant of God," and no greater reward
than for our Master to delight in our prosperity. What true prosperity
may be we are not always best able to judge. We must leave that in
Jesus' hand; he will not fail to rule all things for our highest good.

"For by his saints it stands confessed.

That what he does is always best."

[Psa 35:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#028.md)

Unceasing praise is here vowed to the just and gracious God. From
morning till evening the grateful tongue would talk and sing, and
glorify the Lord. O for such a resolve carried out by us all!
