[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 34:0</span></span>

Title - A Psalm of David, when he changed his behaviour before
Abimelech; who drove him away, and he departed of this transaction,
which reflects no credit upon David's memory, we have a brief account in
[Sa1 21:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#001.md). Although the gratitude
of the Psalmist prompted him thankfully to record the goodness of the
Lord in vouchsafing an undeserved deliverance, yet he weaves none of the
incidents of the escape into the narrative, but dwells only on the grand
fact of his being heard in the hour of peril. We may learn from his
example not to parade our sins before others, as certain vainglorious
professors are wont to do who seem as proud of their sins as old
Greenwich pensioners of their battles and their wounds. David played the
fool with singular dexterity, but he was not so real a fool as to sing
of his own exploits of folly. In the original, the title does not teach
us that the Psalmist composed this poem at the time of his escape from
Achish, the king or Abimelech of Gath, but that it is intended to
commemorate that event, and was suggested by it. It is well to mark our
mercies with well carved memorials. God deserves our best handiwork.
David in view of the special peril from which he was rescued, was at
great pains with this Psalm, and wrote it with considerable regularity,
in almost exact accordance with the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. This
is the second alphabetical Psalm, the twenty-fifth being the first.

Division - The Psalm is split into two great divisions at the close of
[Psa 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#010.md), when the Psalmist having
expressed his praise to God turns in direct address to men. The first
ten verses are a hymn, and the last twelve a sermon. For further
assistance to the reader we may subdivide thus: In [Psa
34:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#001.md), David vows to bless the Lord,
and invites the praise of others; from [Psa
34:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#004.md)he relates his experience, and in
[Psa 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#008.md), [Psa
34:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#009.md), [Psa
34:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#010.md), exhorts the godly to constancy
of faith. In [Psa 34:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#011.md), he gives
direct exhortation, and follows it up by didactic teaching from [Psa
34:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#015.md) to the close.

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Title

Abimelech was king of Gath, the same with Achish, [Sa2
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#020.md) who either had two names, or
this of Abimelech, as it should seem, was a common name to all the kings
of the Philistines (see [Gen 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#002.md);
[Gen 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#008).md); as Pharaoh was to the
Egyptian kings and Caesar to the Roman emperors' the name signifies a
father-king, or my father-king, or a royal father; as kings should be
the fathers of their country: before him David changed his behaviour,
his taste, sense, or reason: he imitated a madman. - John Gill.

Whole Psalm

(This Psalm is alphabetical). The Alphabetical Psalms, the psalmi
abcedarii, as the Latin fathers called them, are nine in number; and I
cannot help thinking it is a pity that, except in the single instance of
the hundred and nineteenth, no hint of their existence should have been
suffered to appear in our authorised version. I will not take it upon me
to affirm, with Ewald, that no version is faithful in which the acrostic
is suppressed; but I do think that the existence of such a remarkable
style of composition ought to be indicated in one way or another, and
that some useful purposes are served by its being actually reproduced in
the translation. No doubt there are difficulties in the way. The Hebrew
Alphabet differs widely from any of those now employed in Europe.
Besides differences of a more fundamental kind, the Hebrew has only
twenty-two letters for our twenty-six; and of the twenty-two a
considerable number have no fellows in ours. An exact reproduction of a
Hebrew acrostic in an English version is therefore impossible. - William
Binnie, D.D.

Whole Psalm

Mr. Hapstone has endeavoured to imitate the alphabetical character of
this Psalm in his metrical version. The letter answering to F is
wanting, and the last stanza begins with the letter answering to R. One
verse of his translation may suffice -

"At all times bless Jehovah's name will I;

His praise shall in my mouth be constantly:

Boast in Jehovah shall my soul henceforth;

Hear it, ye meek ones, and exult with mirth."

[Psa 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#001.md)

"I will bless the Lord at all times." Mr. Bradford, martyr, speaking of
Queen Mary, at whose cruel mercy he then lay, said, If the queen be
pleased to release me, I will thank her; if she will imprison me, I will
thank her; if she will burn me, I will thank her, etc. So saith a
believing soul: Let God do with me what he will, I will be thankful. -
Samuel Clarke's "Mirrour."

[Psa 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#001.md)

Should the whole frame of nature be unhinged, and all outward friends
and supporters prove false and deceitful, our worldly hopes and schemes
be disappointed, and possessions torn from us, and the floods of
sickness, poverty and disgrace overwhelm our soul with an impetuous tide
of trouble; the sincere lover of God, finding that none of these affects
his portion and the object of his panting desires, retires from them all
to God his refuge and hiding place, and there feels his Saviour
incomparably better, and more than equivalent to what the whole of the
universe can ever offer, or rob him of; and his tender mercies,
unexhausted fulness, and great faithfulness, yield him consolation and
rest; and enable him, what time he is afraid, to put his trust in him.
Thus we find the holy Psalmist expressing himself: "I will bless the
Lord at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth." -
William Dunlop.

[Psa 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#001.md)

S. Basil tells us that the praise of God, once rightly impressed as a
seal on the mind, though it may not always be carried out into action,
yet in real truth causes us perpetually to praise God. - J. M. Neale's
Commentary.

[Psa 34:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#002.md)

"My soul shall make her boast in the Lord." Not like the boasting of the
Pharisee, so hateful in the eyes of God, so offensive in the ears of the
humble; for the humble can hear this boasting and be glad, which they
would never do if it were not conformable to the rules of humility. Can
any boasting be greater than to say, "I can do all things"? Yet in this
boasting there is humility when I add, "In him that strengtheneth me."
For though God likes not of boasting, yet he likes of this boasting,
which arrogates nothing to ourselves, but ascribes all to him. - Sir
Richard Baker.

[Psa 34:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#002.md)

There is somewhat very striking and pleasing in the sudden transitions,
and the change of persons, that is observable in these few verses. "My
soul shall boast;" "The humble shall hear;" "I sought the Lord;" "They
looked to him;" "This poor man cried." There is a force and elegance in
the very unconnection of the expressions, which, had they been more
closely tied by the proper particles, would have been in a great measure
lost. Things thus separated from each other, and yet accelerated,
discover, as Longinus observes, the earnestness and the vehemency of the
inward working of the mind; and though it may seem to interrupt, or
disturb the sentence, yet quickens and enforces it. - Samuel Chandler,
D.D.

[Psa 34:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#003.md)

Venema remarks that after the affair with Achish, we are told in [Sa1
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#001.md), "His brethren, and all his
father's house went down to the cave Adullam unto him," and these,
together with those who were in debt, and discontented with Saul's
government, formed a band of four hundred men. To these his friends and
comrades, he relates the story of his escape, and bids them with united
hearts and voices extol the Lord. - C. H. S.

[Psa 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#004.md)

"I sought the Lord, and he heard me." God expects to hear from you
before you can expect to hear from him. If you restrain prayer, it is no
wonder the mercy promised is retained. Meditation is like the lawyer's
studying the case in order to his pleading at the bar: when, therefore,
thou hast viewed the promise, and affected thy heart with the riches of
it, then fly thee to the throne of grace, and spread it before the Lord.
- William Gurnall.

[Psa 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#004.md)

"He delivered me from all my fears." To have delivered me from all my
troubles had been a great favour, but a far greater to deliver me from
all my fears; for where that would but have freed me from present evil,
this secures me from evil to come; that now I enjoy not only
tranquility, but security, a privilege only of the godly. The wicked may
be free from trouble, but can they be free from fear? No; God knows,
though they be not in trouble like other men, yet they live in more fear
than other men. Guiltiness of mind, or mind of the world, never suffers
them to be secure: though they be free sometimes from the fit of an
ague, yet they are never without a grudging; and (if I may use the
expression of poets) though they feel not always the whip of Tysiphone,
yet they feel always her terrors; and, seeing the Lord hath done this
for me, hath delivered me from all my fears, have I not cause, just
cause, to magnify him, and exalt his name? - Sir Richard Baker.

[Psa 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#005.md)

"They looked unto him." The more we can think upon our Lord, and the
less upon ourselves, the better. Looking to him, as he is seated upon
the right hand of the throne of God, will keep our heads, and especially
our hearts, steady when going through the deep waters of affliction.
Often have I thought of this when crossing the water opposite the old
place of Langholm. I found, when I looked down on the water, I got
dizzy; I therefore fixed my eyes upon a steady object on the other side,
and got comfortably through. - David Smith, 1792-1867.

[Psa 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#006.md)

"This poor man cried." The reasons of crying are, 1. Want cannot blush.
The pinching necessity of the saints is not tied to the law of modesty.
Hunger cannot be ashamed. "I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise,"
saith David ([Psa 55:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#002).md); and Hezekiah,
"Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter. I did mourn as a dove"
([Isa 38:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#014).md). "I went mourning without
the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the congregation" ([Job
30:28](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#028).md). 2. Though God hear prayer,
only as prayer offered in Christ, not because very fervent; yet fervour
is a heavenly ingredient in prayer. An arrow drawn with full strength
hath a speedier issue; therefore, the prayers of the saints are
expressed by crying in Scripture. "O my God, I cry in the daytime, but
thou hearest not" ([Psa 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#002).md). "At
noon, will I pray, and cry aloud" ([Psa
55:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#017).md). "In my distress I cried to the
Lord" ([Psa 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#006).md). "Unto thee have I
cried, O Lord" ([Psa 88:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#013).md). "Out of
the depths have I cried" ([Psa 130:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#001).md).
"Out of the belly of hell cried I" (Jonah it. 2). "Unto thee will I cry,
O Lord my rock" ([Psa 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#001).md). Yea, it
goeth to somewhat more than crying: "I cry out of wrong, but I am not
heard" ([Job 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#007).md). "Also when I cry
and shout, he shutteth out my prayer" ([Lam
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#008).md). He who may teach us all to pray,
sweet Jesus, "In the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers
and supplications with strong crying and tears" ([Heb
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007).md); he prayed with war shouts. 3.
And these prayers are so prevalent, that God answereth them: "This poor
man cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his fears"
([Psa 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#006).md). "My cry came before him,
even into his ears" ([Psa 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#006).md). The
cry addeth wings to the prayer, as a speedy post sent to court upon life
and death: "Our fathers cried unto thee, and were delivered" ([Psa
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#005).md). "The righteous cry, and the
Lord heareth" ([Psa 34:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#017).md). - Samuel
Rutherford.

[Psa 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#007.md)

"The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and
delivereth them." I will not rub the questions, whether these angels can
contract themselves, and whether they can subsist in a point, and so
stand together the better in so great a number, neither will I trouble
myself to examine whether they are in such-and-such a place in their
substance, or only in their virtue and operation. But this the godly man
may assure himself of that whensoever he shall want their help, in spite
of doors, and locks, and bars, he may have it in a moment's warning For
there is no impediment, either for want of power because they are
spirits, or from want of good will, both because it is their duty, and
because they bear an affection in him; not only rejoicing at his first
conversion ([Luk 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#010).md), but, I dare
confidently affirm, always disposed with abundance of cheerfulness to do
anything for him. I cannot let pass some words I remember of Origen's to
this purpose, as I have them from his interpreter He brings in the
angels speaking after this manner: - "If he (meaning the Son of God)
went down, and went down into a body, and was clothed with flesh, and
endured its infirmities and died for men, what do we stand still for?
Come, let's all down from heaven together." - Zachary Bogan.

[Psa 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#007.md)

"The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him." This
is the first time that, in the Psalter, we read of the ministrations of
angels. But many fathers rather take this passage of the "Angel of the
Great Counsel," and gloriously to him it applies. - J. M. Neale.

[Psa 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#007.md)

"The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him," etc.
By whom may be meant, either the uncreated Angel, the Lord Jesus Christ,
the Angel of God's presence, and of the covenant, the Captain of
salvation, the Leader and Commander of the people; and whose salvation
is as walls and bulwarks about them, or as an army surrounding them; or
a created angel may be intended even a single one, which is sufficient
to guard a multitude of saints, since one could destroy at once such a
vast number of enemies, as in [Kg2
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035.md); or one may be put for more,
since they are an innumerable company that are on the side of the Lord's
people, and to whom they are joined; and these may be said to encamp
about them, because they are an host or army (see [Gen
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#001.md), [Gen
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#002.md); [Luk
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#013).md); and are the guardians of the
saints, that stand up for them and protect them, as well as minister to
them. - John Gill.

[Psa 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#007.md)

"The angel of the Lord" is represented in his twofold character in this
pair of Psalms, as an angel of mercy, and also as an angel of judgment.
[Psa 35:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#006.md). This pair of Psalms (the
thirty fourth and thirty-fifth), may in this respect be compared with
the twelfth chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, where the angel of the
Lord is displayed as encamping about St. Peter, and delivering him, and
also as smiting the persecutor, Herod Agrippa. - Christopher Wordsworth,
D.D.

[Psa 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#007.md)

"Round about." In illustration of this it may be observed, that
according to D'Arvieux, it is the practice of the Arabs to pitch their
tents in a circular form; the prince being in the middle, and the Arabs
about him, but so as to leave a respectful distance between them. And
Thevenot, describing a Turkish encampment near Cairo, having
particularly noticed the spaciousness, decorations, and conveniences of
the Bashaw's tent, or pavilion, adds, "Round the pale of his tent,
within a pistol shot, were above two hundred tents, pitched in such a
manner that the doors of them all looked towards the Bashaw's tent; and
it ever is so, that they may have their eye always upon their master's
lodging, and be in readiness to assist him if he be attacked." - Richard
Mant.

[Psa 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#008.md)

"O taste and see that the Lord is good." Our senses help our
understandings; we cannot by the most rational discourse perceive what
the sweetness of honey is; taste it and you shall perceive it. "His
fruit was sweet to my taste." Dwell in the light of the Lord, and let
thy soul be always ravished with his love. Get out the marrow and the
fatness that thy portion yields thee. Let fools learn by beholding thy
face how dim their blazes are to the brightness of thy day. - Richard
Alleine, in "Heaven Opened," 1665.

[Psa 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#008.md)

"O taste and see," etc. It is not enough for thee to see it afar off,
and not have it, as Dives did; or to have it in thee, and not to taste
it, as Samson's lion had great store of honey in him, but tasted no
sweetness of it; but thou must as well have it as see it, and as well
taste it as have it. "O taste and see," says he, "how sweet the Lord
is;" for so indeed Christ giveth his church not only a sight but also "a
taste" of his sweetness. A sight is where he saith thus: "We will rise
up early, and go into the vineyard, and see whether the vine have budded
forth the small grapes, and whether the pomegranates flourish;" there is
a sight of the vine. A taste is where he says thus, "I will bring thee
into the wine cellar, and cause thee to drink spiced wine, and new wine
of the pomegranates;" there is a taste of the wine. The church not only
goes into the vineyard and sees the wine, but also goes into the wine
cellar, and tastes the wine. - Thomas Playfere.

[Psa 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#008.md)

"Taste and see." There are some things, especially in the depths of the
religious life, which can only be understood by being experienced, and
which even then are incapable of being adequately embodied in words. "O
taste and see that the Lord is good." The enjoyment must come before the
illumination; or rather the enjoyment is the illumination. There are
things that must be loved before we can know them to be worthy of our
love; things to be believed before we can understand them to be worthy
of belief. And even after this - after we are conscious of a distinct
apprehension of some spiritual truth, we can only, perhaps, answer, if
required to explain it, in the words of the philosopher to whom the
question was put, "What is God?" "I know, if I am not asked." - Thomas
Binney's "Sermons," 1869.

[Psa 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#008.md)

"Taste and see." Be unwilling that all the good gifts of God should be
swallowed without taste or maliciously forgotten, but use your palate,
know them, and consider them. - D. H. Mollerus.

[Psa 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#008.md)

Heaven and earth are replete with the goodness of God. We omit to open
our mouths and eyes, on which account the Psalmist desires us to "taste"
and "see." - Augustus F. Tholuck.

[Psa 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#008.md)

The "taste and see" invite, as it were, to a sumptuous feast, which has
long been ready; to a rich sight openly exposed to view. The imperatives
are in reality not hortatory but persuasive. - E. W. Hengstenberg.

[Psa 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#008.md)

All that the believer can attain of spiritual consolation in this life
is but a taste. - David Dickson.

[Psa 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#008.md)

O taste the Lord, and see how sweet He is,

The man that trusts in him lives still in bliss.

Sir John Davies, 1569-1626.

All these verses are beautiful representations of the fulness,
suitableness, completeness, and all-sufficiency of God in Christ to
answer all the wants of his people. And is there not a vast elegance in
the comparison taken from the hunger and rapacity of the lion, even the
impetuousness of the young lion, to that of the patience and silent
waiting of the faithful believer? A life of faith will find food in
everything, because it is all founded in Christ. The young lions may,
and will lack, because nothing will supply their voracious appetites but
that which is carnal. - Robert Hawker.

[Psa 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#010.md)

"The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger." The old lions will have it
for them, if it be to be had. "But they that seek the Lord shall not
want any good thing." As they would feel no evil thing within, so they
shall want no good thing without. He that freely opens the upper, will
never wholly close the nether springs. There shall be no silver lacking
in Benjamin's sack, while Joseph has it to throw in. Grace is not such a
beggarly visitant, as will not pay its own way. When the best of beings
is adored, the best of blessings are enjoyed. - William Seeker.

[Psa 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#010.md)

People are apt to fancy that a wild beast's life must be happy - in a
brute's sense - and that the carnivorous and graminivorous creatures
which have never come under the dominion of mankind are better off than
the domesticated quadrupeds which buy their quieter and safer lives at
the price of ministering to the luxuries or necessities of their human
lords. But the contrary is the case: the career of a flesh-eating animal
must be wretched, even from the tiger's or leopard's point of view. They
must often suffer pangs of long-continued hunger, and when they find and
kill food they frequently have to wage desperate war for the enjoy-went
of their victim. The cry of almost every wild beast is so melancholy and
forlorn, that it impresses the traveller with sadness more even than
with fear. If the opportunity occurs for watching them in the chase,
they are seen to sneak and sniff about, far less like "kings of the
forest," than poor, dejected, starving wretches, desperate upon the
subject of their next meal. They suffer horribly from diseases induced
by foul diet and long abstinence; and very few are found without scars
in their hide - the tokens of terrible combats. If they live to old age
their lot is piteous: their teeth are worn down, their claws are blunt,
and in this state numbers of them perish by starvation. Not one half of
the wild animals die a natural death; and their life, so far as it can
be observed, is a series of stern privations, with desperate and bloody
fights among themselves. - Clipping from "Daily Telegraph."

[Psa 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#010.md)

"They that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing." There shall be
no want to such, and such shall want no good thing: so that he must be
such an one to whom the promise is made; and he must also be sure that
it is good for him which is promised. But oftentimes it is not good for
a man to abound with earthly blessings; as strong drink is not good for
weak brains. Yea, if anything be wanting to a good man, he may be sure
it is not good for him; and then better that he doth want it, than that
he did enjoy it; and what wise man will complain of the want of that,
which if he had, would prove more hurtful than gainful to him? As a
sword to a madman, a knife to a child, drink to them that have a fever
or the dropsy. "No good thing will God withhold," etc, and therefore,
not wants themselves, which to many are also good, yea, very good
things, as I could reckon up many. Want sanctified is a notable means to
bring to repentance, to work in us amendment of life, it stirs up
prayer, it weans from the love of the world, it keeps us always prepared
for the spiritual combat, discovers whether we be true believers or
hypocrites, prevents greater evils of sin and punishment to come; it
makes us humble, conformable to Christ our Head, increaseth our faith,
our joy, and thankfulness, our spiritual wisdom, and likewise our
patience, as I have largely shown in another treatise. - Richard Young,
in the "Poor's Advocate," 1653.

[Psa 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#010.md)

I remember as I came through the country, that there was a poor widow
woman, whose husband fell at Bothwell: the bloody soldiers came to
plunder her house, telling her they would take all she had. "We will
leave thee nothing," said they, "either to put in thee, or on thee." "I
care not," said she, "I will not want as long as God is in the heavens."
That was a believer indeed. - Alexander Peden's Sermon, 1682.

[Psa 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#010.md)

Take a survey of heaven and earth and all things therein, and whatsoever
upon sure ground appears good, ask it confidently of Christ; his love
will not deny it. If it were good for you that there were no sin, no
devil, no affliction, no destruction, the love of Christ would instantly
abolish these. Nay, if the possession of all the kingdoms of the world
were absolutely good for any saint, the love of Christ would instantly
crown him monarch of them. - David Clarkson.

[Psa 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#010) (last clause.md)

Part of his last afternoon was spent by Columba in transcribing the
Psalms of David. Having come to that passage in the thirty-fourth Psalm,
where it is said, "They that seek the Lord shall not want any good
thing," he said, "I have come to the end of a page, and I will stop
here, for the following verse, "Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I
will teach you the fear of the Lord," will better suit my successor to
transcribe than me. I will leave it, therefore, to Baithen." As usual,
the bell was rung at midnight for prayers. Columba was the first to
hasten to church. On entering it soon after, Dermid found him on his
knees in prayer, but evidently dying. Raising him up in his arms, he
supported his head on his bosom. The brethren now entered. When they saw
Columba in this dying condition they wept aloud. Columba heard them. He
opened his eyes and attempted to speak, but his voice failed. He lifted
up his hands as if to bless them, immediately after which he breathed
out his spirit. His countenance retained in death the expression it wore
in life, so that it seemed as if he had only fallen asleep. - "Story of
Columba and his Successors," in the Christian Treasury for 1848.

[Psa 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#011.md)

"Come, ye children." Venema in substance remarks that David in
addressing his friends in the cave, called them his sons or children,
because he was about to be their teacher, and they his disciples; and
again, because they were young men in the flower of their age, and as
sons, would be the builders up of his house; and still more, because as
their leader to whose discipline and command they were subject, he had a
right to address them as his children. - C. H. S.

[Psa 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#011.md)

"Come ye children," etc. You know your earthly parents, ay, but labour
to know your heavenly. You know the fathers of your flesh, ay, but
strive to know the Father of your spirits. You are expert in may be in
Horace's Odes, Virgil's Eclogues, Cicero's Orations; oh! but strive to
get understanding in David's Psalms, Solomon's Proverbs, and the other
plain books of Holy Writ. Manna was to be gathered in the morning. The
orient pearl is generated of the morning dew; aurora musis amica, the
morning is a friend to the muses. O "remember thy Creator," know him in
the morning of thy childhood. When God had created the heavens and the
earth, the first thing he did was to adorn the world with light, and
separate it from the darkness. Happy is that child on whom the light of
saving knowledge begins to dawn early. God, in the law, required the
first-born, and the first-fruits, so he doth still our first days, to be
offered to him. They are wisdom's words, "They that seek me early shall
find me." [Pro 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#017.md). Where a rabbin
observeth a כ is added to the verb more than usual, which in numbering
goeth for fifty. With this note, that early seeking hath not only twenty
or thirty, but fifty, nay, indeed, an hundred fold recompense attending
on it. - Nathanael Hardy.

[Psa 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#011.md)

"Come, ye children." David in this latter part of the Psalm undertakes
to teach children; though a man of war and anointed to be king, he did
not think it below him: though now he had his head so full of cares, and
his hands of business, yet he could find heart and time to give good
counsel to young people from his own experience. - Matthew Henry.

[Psa 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#011.md)

Observe - I. What he expects from them, "Hearken unto me," leave your
play, lay by your toys, and hear what I have to say to you; not only
give me the hearing, but observe and obey me. II. What he undertakes to
teach them "The fear of the Lord," inclusive of all the duties of
religion. David was a famous musician, a statesman, a soldier, but he
doth not say to his children, I will teach you to play upon the harp, or
to handle the sword or spear, or draw the bow, or I will teach you the
maxims of state policy, but I will teach you the fear of the Lord, which
is better than all arts and sciences, better than all burnt-offerings
and sacrifices. That is it which we should be solicitous both to learn
ourselves, and to teach our children. - Matthew Henry.

[Psa 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#011.md)

"I will teach you the fear of the Lord." I shall introduce the
translation and paraphrase from my old Psalter; and the rather because I
believe there is a reference to that very improper and unholy method of
teaching youth the system of heathen mythology before they are taught
one sound lesson of true divinity, till at last their minds are imbued
with heathenism, and the vicious conduct of gods, goddesses, and heroes
(here very properly called tyrants), becomes the model of their own; and
they are as heathenish without as they are heathenish within.

Trans. "Cummes sones leve me: dred of Lord I sal you lere.

Par. "Cummes with trauth and luf: sones, qwam I gette in haly lere: here
me. With eres of hert. I sal leve you, noght the fabyls of poetes; na
the storys of tyrauntz; bot the dred of oure Lorde, that wyl bring you
til the felaghschippe of aungels; and thar in is lyf." I need not
paraphrase this paraphrase, as it is plain enough. - Adam Clarke.

[Psa 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#011.md)

"The fear of the Lord." The Master of Sentences dwells, from this verse,
on the four kinds of fear: mundane, servile, initial, filial. Mundane,
when we fear to commit sin, simply lest we should lose some worldly
advantage or incur some worldly inconvenience. Servile, when we fear to
commit sin, simply because of hell torments due to it. Initial, when we
fear to commit it lest we should lose the happiness of heaven. Filial,
when we fear, only and entirely because we dread to offend that God whom
we love with all our hearts. "I will teach." Whence notice, that this
fear is not a thing to be learnt all at once; it needs careful study and
a good master. S. Chrysostom compares the Psalmist's school here with
the resort of heathen students to the academy; and S. Ephraem, referring
to this passage, calls the fear of God itself the school of the mind.
"As if he proclaimed," says S. Lawrence Justiniani, "I will teach you,
not the courses of the stars, not the nature of things, not the secrets
of the heavens, but the fear of the Lord. The knowledge of such matters,
without fear, puffs up; but the fear of the Lord, without any such
knowledge, can save." "Here," says Cassiodorus, "is not fear to be
feared, but to be loved. Human fear is full of bitterness; divine fear
of sweetness: the one drives to slavery, the other allures to liberty;
the one dreads the prison of Gehenna, the other opens the kingdom of
heaven." - J. M. Neale.

[Psa 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#011.md)

"The fear of the Lord." Let this, therefore, good children, be your
principal care and study; for what shall it avail you to be cunning in
Tully, Virgil, Homer, and other profane writers, if you be unskilful in
God's book? to here learned Greek and Latin, if you learn not withal the
language of Canaan? to have your speech agreeable to the rules of
Priscian, of Lily, if your lives and courses be not consonant to the
rules and laws of Christianity? to have knowledge of the creatures when
you are ignorant of the Creator? to have learned that whereby you may
live a while here, and neglect that whereby you may live eternally
hereafter? Learn to fear God, to serve God, and then God will bless you;
for "He will bless them that fear him, both small and great." [Psa
115:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#013.md). - Thomas Gataker's "David's
Instructor," 1637.

[Psa 34:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#012.md)

It is no great matter to live long, or always, but to live happily. That
loyal prayer, "Let the king live" (in every language) imports a
prosperous state. When the Psalmist saith, "Who is the man that would
see life?" he explaineth himself presently after by "good days." Vivere
among the Latins is sometimes as much as valere, to live is as much as
to be well; and upon this account it is that as, on the one hand, the
Scripture calls the state of the damned an eternal death, because their
life is only a continuance in misery; so on the other hand the state of
the blessed is an eternal life, because it is a perpetual abode in
felicity. - Nathanael Hardy.

[Psa 34:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#012.md)

The benefit of life is not in the length, but in the use of it. He
sometimes lives the least that lives the longest. - Seneca.

[Psa 34:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#013.md)

"Keep thy tongue from evil," etc. Ficinus, after his tracts, De sanitate
tuenda, of keeping good health; and another, of recovering health; and a
third, of prolonging life; because all will not do, wisely addeth a
fourth, of laying hold on eternal life; which cannot be done but by
mortifying this earthly member, a loose and lewd tongue. "For by thy
words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be
condemned," saith the Judge himself. [Mat
12:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#037.md), Compare [Gen
49:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#021.md) with [Deu
33:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#023.md), and it will appear that good
words ingratiate with God and man. - John Trapp.

[Psa 34:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#013.md)

"And thy lips from speaking guile." Perhaps David, in warning us that we
speak no guile, reflects upon his own sin in changing his behaviour.
They that truly repent of what they have done amiss, will warn others to
take heed of doing likewise. - Matthew Henry.

[Psa 34:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#014.md)

"Depart from evil," etc. This denotes that evil is near to men; it keeps
close to them, and should be declined and shunned and it regards all
sorts of evil; evil men and their evil company; evil things, evil words
and works, and all appearance of evil; and the fear of the Lord shows
itself in a hatred of it, and a departure from it. [Pro
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#013.md); [Pro
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#006.md). - John Gill.

[Psa 34:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#014.md)

"Depart from evil." The other precepts are the duty of works, and they
are four, where the precepts of words were but two; because we must be
more in works than in words; and they are all affirmative, for it is
against the nature of a work to be in the negative; for so working
should be no better than idleness the two former are general, as general
as good and evil; that if we meet with anything that is evil, our part
is to depart, for there is no detouring upon evil. - Sir Richard Baker.

[Psa 34:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#014.md)

"Do good." Negative goodness is not sufficient to entitle us to heaven.
There are some in the world whose religion runs all upon negatives; they
are not drunkards they are not swearers, and for this they do bless
themselves. See how the Pharisee vapours ([Luk
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#011).md), "God, I thank thee that I am
not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers," etc. Alas! the
not being scandalous will no more make a Christian than a cypher will
make a sum. We are bid, not only to cease from evil, but to do good. It
will be a poor plea at last - Lord, I kept myself from being spotted
with gross sin: I did no hurt. But what good is there in thee? It is not
enough for the servant of the vineyard that he doth no hurt there, he
doth not break the trees, or destroy the hedges; if he doth not work in
the vineyard he loseth his pay. It is not enough for us to say at the
last day, we have done no hurt, we have lived in no gross sin; but what
good have we done in the vineyard? Where is the grace we have gotten? If
we cannot show this, we shall lose our pay, and miss of salvation. -
Thomas Watson.

[Psa 34:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#014.md)

"Seek peace, and pursue it." Yea, do well, and thou shalt not need to
pursue it; peace will find thee without seeking. Augustine says, Fiat
justitia, et habebis pacere - Live righteously, and live peaceably.
Quietness shall find out righteousness wheresoever he lodgeth. But she
abhorreth the house of evil. Peace will not dine where grace hath not
first broken her fast. Let us embrace godliness, and "the peace of God
that passeth all understanding, shall preserve our hearts and minds in
Jesus Christ." [Phi 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#007.md). - Thomas
Adams.

[Psa 34:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#014.md)

"Seek peace and pursue it." The most desirable things are not the
easiest to be obtained. What is more lovely to the imagination than the
tranquillity of peace? But this great blessing does not voluntarily
present itself it must be sought. Even when sought it often eludes the
grasp: it flies away, and must be pursued. 1. The man of peaceable
carriage must be cautious not to give offence when needless, or, when it
may innocently be spared. 2. Another part of the peaceable man's
character is, not to take offence; especially in small matters, which
are hardly worth a wise man's notice. 3. If any needless offence has
been either given or taken, we must endeavour to put a stop to it as
soon as may be. If a difference is already begun, stifle it in the
birth, and suffer it not to proceed farther. - Condensed from Dr.
Waterland's Sermon, in J. R. Pitman's Course of Sermons on the Psalms,
1846.

[Psa 34:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#015.md)

"His ears are open unto their cry." The word "open" is not in the
original, but the meaning is that the ear of God is propense, and in a
leaning kind of posture, towards the cries of the righteous; the word
may here be taken emphatically, as many times in Scripture it is, for
some worthy, choice, and excellent strain of righteousness. Those who
are worthy and righteous indeed, the ear of God, I say, is propense, and
leans and hangs towards them and their prayers, according to that of
[Sol 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#014.md), "Let me hear thy voice, for
sweet is thy voice." There is a kind of naturalness and pleasantness
between the ear of God and the prayers and petitions, and cries of such
a righteous man. [Joh 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#007.md). - John
Goodwin.

[Psa 34:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#015.md)

"His ears are open unto their cry." Hebrew, "Are to their cry," or as
St. Peter hath it, "His ears are into their prayers" ([Pe1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#012).md); to show that though their
prayers are so faint and feeble that they cannot enter into the ears of
the Lord of Hosts, yet that he will bow down and incline his ears unto,
nay, into their prayers, their breathings. [Lam
3:56](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#056.md). - John Trapp.

[Psa 34:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#015.md)

"The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto
their cry." Strangers may howl, and we take little notice what they all
- it is a venture whether we relieve them or no; but if our children
cry, being in great distress, we hasten to their help. Our relation to
God may well strengthen our hope that our desires shall be heard. He
that can cry, Abba, Father, may be confident of the success of his suit,
and that God wilt deal with him as a son. - George Swinnock.

[Psa 34:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#018.md)

"The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart." God is nigh
unto them (with reverence be it spoken), God takes so much complacency
in the company of such, that he cannot endure to have them far from him;
he must have them always nigh to him, always under his eyes; as for
these "broken" ones, he will be sure not to leave them long, nor to go
far from them, but will be ready at hand to set their bones, to bind up
their wounds to keep them from festering. It may be he may put them to
much pain before he brings the cure to perfection, but it is to prevent
future aches. He is a foolish cruel chirurgeon, who, for fear of putting
his patient to some pain, never searcheth the wound, but skins it over
presently; and a wise man will not think him unmerciful that puts him to
exquisite pain, so he make a thorough cure of it. Thus God doth by his
patients sometimes, when the nature of their distemper calls for it.
But, however, he will be sure not to be out of the way when they want
him most. It is possible they may look upon themselves as forgotten by
God, they may not know their Physician when he is by them, and they may
take their Friend for an enemy; they may think God far off when he is
near; but when their eyes are opened and their distemper is pretty well
worn off, they will, with shame and thankfulness, acknowledge their
error; nay, they do from their souls confess, that they do not deserve
the least look of kindness from God, but to be counted strangers and
enemies; but God will let them know that he loves to act like himself,
that is, like a God of love, mercy, and goodness; and that they are the
persons that he hath set his heart upon; he will have them in his bosom,
never leave them nor forsake them; and though these contrite ones many
times look upon themselves as lost, yet God will save them, and they
shall sing a song of thankfulness amongst his delivered ones. - James
Janeway.

[Psa 34:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#018.md)

"The Lord is nigh unto them," etc. Consider the advantages of this
broken heart; as I. A broken heart is acceptable and well pleasing to
God, "A broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise." [Psa
51:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#017.md). II. It makes up many defects in
your service and duties, "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit."
[Psa 51:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#017.md). III. It makes the soul a
fit receptacle for God to dwell in, "For thus saith the high and lofty
One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is holy; I dwell in the high
and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to
revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite
ones." [Isa 57:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#015.md). IV. It brings God
near to men, "The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, and
sayeth such as be of a contrite spirit." [Psa
34:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#018.md). And V. It lays you open to
Christ's sweet healing, "I will bind up that which was broken, and will
strengthen that which was sick." [Eze
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#016.md). And, oh, who would not be
broken that they may find Christ's soft hand healing them, and find the
proof of that sweet word, "For I will restore health unto thee, and I
will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the Lord." [Jer
30:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#017.md). Yea, VI. It puts you in the
right road to heaven, where all your wounds and bruises will be cured;
for there is a tree ([Rev 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#002).md) the
leaves whereof are for the healing of the nations; there is no
complaining there of wounds or bruises, but all are perfectly healed. -
John Spalding, in "Synaxis, Sacra, or a Collection of Sermons, etc.,
1703.

[Psa 34:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#018.md)

"The Lord is nigh unto them," etc. We are apt to overlook men, in
proportion as they are humbled beneath us; God regards them in that
proportion. Vessels of honour are made of that clay which is "broken"
into the smallest parts. - George Horne.

[Psa 34:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#018.md)

"Broken heart.... contrite spirit." Oh, this is the misery of all
miseries which ministers have most cause to complain of, that men are
not fitted enough for Jesus Christ, they are not lost enough in
themselves for a Saviour. "In thee the fatherless findeth mercy." [Hos
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#003.md). Were we more hopeless, helpless,
and fatherless, we should find more mercy from the hand of Jesus Christ.
O that God would awaken and shake some sin-sleeping soul this day! O
that this doctrine thus opened might be as a thunderbolt to let some of
you see the inside of yourselves! O poor sinner, thou hast an
unsupportable burden of sin and guilt lying on thy soul, ready to press
thee down to hell, and yet thou feelest it not; thou hast the wrath of
God hanging over thy head by the twirled thread of a short life, which
it may be thou mayest not be free from one year, nay, perhaps not one
month, but thou seest it not; it thou didst but see it, then thou
wouldest cry out as he did in Bosworth field, "A horse! a horse! a
kingdom for a horse!" So thou wouldest cry out, None but Christ! nothing
but Christ! ten thousand worlds for Christ! - James Nalton, 1664.

[Psa 34:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#018.md)

"A contrite spirit." דּכּאי-דוּה, dakkeey ruach, "the beaten-out
spirit." In both words the hammer is necessarily implied; in breaking to
pieces the ore first, and then plating out the metal when it has been
separated from the ore. This will call to the reader's remembrance [Jer
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#029.md), "Is not my word like as a fire?
saith the Lord: and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?" The
breaking to shivers, and beating out are metaphorical expressions: so
are the hammer and the rock. What the large hammer struck on a rock by a
powerful hand would do, so does the word of the Lord when struck on the
sinner's heart by the power of the Holy Spirit. The broken heart, and
the contrite spirit, are two essential characteristics of true
repentance. - Adam Clarke.

[Psa 34:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#019.md)

"Many are the afflictions of the righteous," etc. Be our troubles many
in number, strange in nature, heavy in measure; yet God's mercies are
more numerous, his wisdom more wondrous, his power more miraculous; he
will deliver us out of all. - Thomas Adams.

[Psa 34:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#019.md)

"Many are the afflictions of the righteous," etc. When David did behold
his trouble, like the host of the Aramites ([Kg2
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#016).md), he looked back unto God like
Elisha, and spied one with him stronger than all against him. Therefore,
respecting his afflictions he crieth, "Many are the troubles of the
righteous;" respecting the promise he sayeth, "The Lord delivereth him
out of all." Thus, by his own foot, David measureth the condition of the
righteous, and saith, "Many are the troubles of the righteous;" and
then, by his own cure, he showeth how they should be healed by saying,
"The Lord will deliver him out of them all." ... The lawyer can deliver
his client but from strife, the physician can deliver his patient but
from sickness, the master can deliver his servant but from bondage, but
the Lord delivereth us from all. As when Moses came to deliver the
Israelites, the would not leave a hoof behind him, so when the Lord
cometh to deliver the righteous he will not leave a trouble behind him.
He who saith, "I put away all thine iniquities," will also say, "I put
away all thine infirmities." - Henry Smith.

[Psa 34:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#020.md)

"He keepeth all his bones," which were very many. Perhaps (saith
Abenezra here), David had been scourged by the Philistines, but his
bones were not broken, nor were our Saviour's. [Joh
19:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#036.md). - John Trapp.

[Psa 34:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#020.md)

"All his bones." Muis observes, "It say not his body, for this he
permits to be afflicted; but it signifies that the evils of the godly
are light, and scarcely penetrate to the bone;" but Geier observes,
"This is too subtle, rather the bone reminds us of the essential parts
of the body, by whose injury the whole frame is endangered. It is a
proverbial form of speech like that in [Mat
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#030.md), 'The very hairs of your head
are all numbered,' expressing the remarkable defence afforded to the
righteous." Genebrard, says, "The bones are put by synecdoche for all
the members." - From Poli Synopsis.

[Psa 34:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#020.md)

The passover lamb, of which not a bone was broken, prefigured Jesus as
one, "not a bone of whose body should be broken;" and yet, at the same
time it prefigured the complete keeping and safety of Christ's body, the
church; as it is written, "He keepeth all his bones; not one of them is
broken." - Andrew A. Bonar's Commentary on Leviticus.

[Psa 34:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#020.md)

Christ's bones were in themselves breakable, but could not actually be
broken by all the violence in the world, because God had fore-decreed, a
bone of him shall not be broken. So we confess God's children mortal;
but all the power of devil or man may not, must not, cannot, kill them
before their conversion, according to God's election of them to life,
which must be fully accomplished. - Thomas Fuller.

[Psa 34:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#020.md)

Observe as a point of resemblance between this and the following Psalm,
the mention of the bones here and in [Psa
35:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#010.md). - C. Wordsworth.

[Psa 34:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#021.md)

"Evil." Afflictions though in the plural, prove not ruinous to the
righteous, for the Lord delivers him out of them all, whereas evil in
the singular slays the wicked, to signify the difference of God's
economy towards righteous and wicked men. The former is permitted to
fall into many pressures, the latter is not so frequently exercised with
them, yet the many that befall the one do no hurt, but work good for
him, whereas the fewer that befall the wicked, or perhaps the one
singular affliction of his life is the utter ruin of him. - Henry
Hammond.

[Psa 34:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#021.md)

Conscience' self the culprit tortures, gnawing him with pangs unknown;

For that now amendment's season is for ever past and gone,

And that late repentance findeth pardon none for all her moan.

S. Peter Damiano, 988-1072.

[Psa 34:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#021.md)

"Shall be desolate." In the margin it is, shall be guilty. And this is
the proper meaning of the original word, יאשׁמוּ. They are guilty, and
liable to punishment. Thus the word is frequently rendered in our
version (see [Lev 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#013.md), [Lev
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#022).md); and generally includes in it
the idea of guilt, and the punishment incurred by it. - Samuel Chandler.
D.D.

[Psa 34:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#022.md)

The promises of God to his church, and his threatenings of sin recorded
in the living book of his word, are not antiquate; no age shall ever
superannuate them, or put them out of full force and virtue. What if
good persons and good causes do suffer oppression? The poet is a divine
in that case -

Informes hiemes reducit

Jupiter; idem

Summovet. Non si male nunc, et olim

Sic erit.

After foul weather comes fair; though it be ill with us now, it will not
be always. What if enemies of religion and moths of commonwealth do
flourish and prosper, and have all things at will, let it not trouble
David and Job; both of them saw as fair a sunshine shut up in a dark
cloud, and a world of foul weather following. - Edward Marbury.

[Psa 34:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#022.md)

Satan cannot tempt longer than God shall give him leave; and he will
never suffer thee to be tempted above measure, but will give a good
issue unto the temptation. Thou art called to fight under the banner of
Christ Jesus, and in the name of the Lord thou shalt be enabled to do
valiantly and overcome. If Satan continue his assaults, "God's grace is
sufficient for thee." [Co2 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009.md). If
thy strength be clean gone, God's power shall be magnified the more in
thee, and he hath brought thee low that thou mayest not trust in
thyself, but in the living Lord, and that the whole praise of the
victory might be ascribed unto him. If thy strength did remain, it was
not to be leaned unto; and now it is decayed and gone, there is no cause
of fear for the Lord will be thy stay. In the most difficult assaults
and tedious encounters, we are exhorted to "be strong in the Lord, and
in the power of his might." Be of good courage, and God will grant thee
an easy, a joyful victory. Satan's drift in tempting is to turmoil,
dishearten, and perplex with fears, and drive into despair; and if thou
take heart to rest quietly upon God's grace, and fly unto his name, thou
shalt put him to flight, thou hast already got the day. Wait but awhile,
and these dark mists and terrible storms shall be dispersed. By these
temptations the Lord hath taught thee to see thy weakness, and the
malice of Satan; to deny thine own wisdom and prize his favour, lightly
to esteem all things here below, and highly to value mercy reaching to
the pardon of sin, and heavenly communion, and fellowship with God. And
if this bitter potion hath wrought so kindly for thy spiritual good, why
shouldst thou be dismayed? Trust in the Lord, be of good courage, and he
shall strengthen thee. "The Lord redeemeth the soul of his servants: and
none of them that trust in him shall be desolate." - John Ball.

[Psalms 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 34:1</span></span>

1 I will bless the Lord at all times: his praise shall continually be in
my mouth.

2 My soul shall make her boast in the Lord: the humble shall hear
thereof, and be glad.

3 O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together.

[Psa 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#001.md)

"I will bless the Lord at all times." - He is resolved and fixed, "I
will;" he is personally and for himself determined, let others do as
they may; he is intelligent in head and inflamed in heart - he knows to
whom the praise is due, and what is due, and for what and when. To
Jehovah, and not to second causes our gratitude is to be rendered. The
Lord hath by right a monopoly in his creatures' praise. Even when a
mercy may remind us of our sin with regard to it, as in this case
David's deliverance from the Philistine monarch was sure to do, we are
not to rob God of his meed of honour because our conscience justly
awards a censure to our share in the transaction. Though the hook was
rusty, yet God sent the fish, and we thank him for it. "At all times,"
in every situation, under every circumstance, before, in and after
trials, in bright clays of glee, and dark nights of fear. He would never
have done praising, because never satisfied that he had done enough;
always feeling that he fell short of the Lord's deservings. Happy is he
whose fingers are wedded to his harp. He who praises God for mercies
shall never want a mercy for which to praise. To bless the Lord is never
unseasonable. "His praise shall continually be in my mouth," not in my
heart merely, but in my mouth too. Our thankfulness is not to be a dumb
thing; it should be one of the daughters of music. Our tongue is our
glory, and it ought to reveal the glory of God. What a blessed mouthful
is God's praise! How sweet, how purifying, how perfuming! If men's
mouths were always thus filled, there would be no repining against God,
or slander of neighbours. If we continually rolled this dainty morsel
under our tongue, the bitterness of daily affliction would be swallowed
up in joy. God deserves blessing with the heart, and extolling with the
mouth - good thoughts in the closet, and good words in the world.

[Psa 34:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#002.md)

"My soul shall make her boast in the Lord." Boasting is a very natural
propensity, and if it were used as in this case, the more it were
indulged the better. The exultation of this verse is no mere tongue
bragging, "the soul" is in it, the boasting is meant and felt before it
is expressed. What scope there is for holy boasting in Jehovah! His
person, attributes, covenant, promises, works, and a thousand things
besides, are all incomparable, unparalleled, matchless; we may cry them
up as we please, but we shall never be convicted of vain and empty
speech in so doing. Truly he who writes these words of comment has
nothing of his own to boast of, but much to lament over, and yet none
shall stop him of his boast in God so long as he lives. "The humble
shall hear thereof, and be glad." They are usually grieved to hear
boastings; they turn aside from vauntings and lofty speeches, but
boasting in the Lord is quite another matter; by this the most lowly are
consoled and encouraged. The confident expressions of tried believers
are a rich solace to their brethren of less experience. We ought to talk
of the Lord's goodness on purpose that others may be confirmed in their
trust in a faithful God.

[Psa 34:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#003.md)

"O magnify the Lord with me." Is this request addressed to the humble?
If so it is most fitting. Who can make God great but those who feel
themselves to be little? He bids them help him to make the Lord's fame
greater among the sons of men. Jehovah is infinite, and therefore cannot
really be made greater, but his name grows in manifested glory as he is
made known to his creatures, and thus he is said to be magnified. It is
well when the soul feels its own inability adequately to glorify the
Lord, and therefore stirs up others to the gracious work; this is good
both for the man himself and for his companions. No praise can excel
that which lays us prostrate under a sense of our own nothingness, while
divine grace like some topless Alp rises before our eyes, and sinks us
lower and lower in holy awe. "Let us exalt his name together." Social,
congregated worship is the outgrowth of one of the natural instincts of
the new life. In heaven it is enjoyed to the full, and earth is likest
heaven where it abounds.

[Psalms 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 34:4</span></span>

4 I sought the Lord, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my
fears.

5 They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not
ashamed.

6 This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all
his troubles.

7 The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and
delivereth them.

[Psa 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#004.md)

"I sought the Lord, and he heard me." It must have been in a very
confused manner that David prayed, and there must have been much of
self-sufficiency in his prayer, or he would not have resorted to methods
of such dubious morality as pretending to be mad and behaving as a
lunatic; yet his poor limping prayer had an acceptance and brought him
succour: the more reason for them celebrating the abounding mercy of the
Lord. We may seek God even when we have sinned. If sin could blockade
the mercy-seat it would be all over with us, but the mercy is that there
are gifts even for the rebellious, and an advocate for men who sin. "And
delivered me from all my fears." God makes a perfect work of it. He
clears away both our fears and their causes, all of them without
exception. Glory be to his name, prayer sweeps the field, slays all the
enemies and even buries their bones. Note the egoism of this verse and
of those preceding it; we need not blush to speak of ourselves when in
so doing we honestly aim at glorifying God, and not at exalting
ourselves. Some are foolishly squeamish upon this point, but they should
remember that when modesty robs God it is most immodest.

[Psa 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#005.md)

"They looked unto him, and were lightened." The Psalmist avows that his
case was not at all peculiar, it was matched in the lives of all the
faithful; they too, each one of them on looking to their Lord were
brightened up, their faces began to shine, their spirits were uplifted.
What a means of blessing one look at the Lord may be! There is life,
light, liberty, love, everything in fact, in a look at the crucified
One. Never did a sore heart look in vain to the good Physician; never a
dying soul turned its darkening eye to the brazen serpent to find its
virtue gone. "And their faces were not ashamed." Their faces were
covered with joy but not with blushes. He who trusts in God has no need
to be ashamed of his confidence, time and eternity will both justify his
reliance.

[Psa 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#006.md)

"This poor man cried." Here he returns to his own case. He was poor
indeed, and so utterly friendless that his life was in great jeopardy;
but he cried in his heart to the protector of his people and found
relief. His prayer was a cry, for brevity and bitterness, for
earnestness and simplicity, for artlessness and grief; it was a poor
man's cry, but it was none the less powerful with heaven, for "the Lord
heard him," and to be heard of God is to be delivered; and so it is
added the Lord "saved him out of all his troubles." At once and
altogether David was clean rid of all his woes. The Lord sweeps our
griefs away as men destroy a hive of hornets, or as the winds clear away
the mists. Prayer can clear us of troubles as easily as the Lord made a
riddance of the frogs and flies of Egypt when Moses entreated him. This
verse is the Psalmists' own personal testimony: he being dead yet
speaketh. Let the afflicted reader take heart and be of good courage.

[Psa 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#007.md)

"The angel of the Lord." The covenant angel, the Lord Jesus, at the head
of all the bands of heaven, surrounds with his army the dwellings of the
saints. Like hosts entrenched so are the ministering spirits encamped
around the Lord's chosen, to serve and succour, to defend and console
them. "Encampeth round about them that fear him." On every side the
watch is kept by warriors of sleepless eyes, and the Captain of the host
is one whose prowess none can resist. "And delivereth them." We little
know how many providential deliverances we owe to those unseen hands
which are charged to bear us up lest we dash our foot against a stone.

[Psalms 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 34:8</span></span>

8 O taste and see that the Lord is good: blessed is the man that
trusteth in him.

9 O fear the Lord, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear
him.

10 The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the
Lord shall not want any good thing.

[Psa 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#008.md)

"O taste and see." Make a trial, an inward, experimental trial of the
goodness of God. You cannot see except by tasting for yourself; but if
you taste you shall see, for this, like Jonathan's honey, enlightens the
eyes. "That the Lord is good." You can only know this really and
personally by experience. There is the banquet with its oxen and
fatlings; its fat things full of marrow, and wines on the lees well
refined; but their sweetness will be all unknown to you except you make
the blessings of grace your own, by a living, inward, vital
participation in them. "Blessed is the man that trusteth in him." Faith
is the soul's taste; they who test the Lord by their confidence always
find him good, and they become themselves blessed. The second clause of
the verse, is the argument in support of the exhortation contained in
the first sentence.

[Psa 34:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#009.md)

"O fear the Lord, lie his saints." Pay to him humble childlike
reverence, walk in his laws, have respect to his will, tremble to offend
him, hasten to serve him. Fear not the wrath of men, neither be tempted
to sin through the virulence of their threats; fear God and fear nothing
else. "For there is no want to them that fear him." Jehovah will not
allow his faithful servants to starve. He may not give luxuries, but the
promise binds him to supply necessaries, and he will not run back from
his word. Many whims and wishes may remain ungratified, but real wants
the Lord will supply. The fear of the Lord or true piety is not only the
duty of those who avow themselves to be saints, that is, persons set
apart and consecrated for holy duties, but it is also their path of
safety and comfort. Godliness hath the promise of the life which now is.
If we were to die like dogs, and there were no hereafter, yet were it
well for our own happiness' sake to fear the Lord. Men seek a patron and
hope to prosper; he prospers surely who hath the Lord of Hosts to be his
friend and defender.

[Psa 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#010.md)

"The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger." They are fierce, cunning,
strong, in all the rigour of youth, and yet they sometimes howl in their
ravenous hunger, and even so crafty, designing, and oppressing men, with
all their sagacity and unscrupulousness, often come to want; yet
simple-minded believers, who dare not act as the greedy lions of earth,
are fed with food convenient for them. To trust God is better policy
than the craftiest politicians can teach or practise. "But they that
seek the Lord shall not want any good thing." No really good thing shall
be denied to those whose first and main end in life is to seek the Lord.
Men may call them fools, but the Lord will prove them wise. They shall
win where the world's wiseacres lose their all, and God shall have the
glory of it.

[Psalms 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 34:11</span></span>

11 Come ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the
Lord.

12 What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may
see good?

13 Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.

14 Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.

[Psa 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#011.md)

"Come, ye children." Though a warrior and a king, the Psalmist was not
ashamed to teach children. Teachers of youth belong to the true peerage;
their work is honourable, and their reward shall be glorious. Perhaps
the boys and girls of Gath had made sport of David in his seeming
madness, and if so, he here aims by teaching the rising race to undo the
mischief which he had done aforetime. Children are the most hopeful
persons to teach - wise men who wish to propagate their principles take
care to win the ear of the young. "Hearken unto me: I will teach you the
fear of the Lord." So far as they can be taught by word of mouth, or
learned by the hearing of the ear, we are to communicate the faith and
fear of God, inculcating upon the rising generation the principles and
practices of piety. This verse may be the address of every Sabbath
School teacher to his class, of every parent to his children. It is not
without instruction in the art of teaching. We should be winning and
attractive to the youngsters, bidding them "come," and not repelling
them with harsh terms. We must get them away, apart from toys and
sports, and try to occupy their minds with better pursuits; for we
cannot well teach them while their minds are full of other things. We
must drive at the main point always, and keep the fear of the Lord ever
uppermost in our teachings, and in so doing we may discreetly cast our
own personality into the scale by narrating our own experiences and
convictions.

[Psa 34:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#012.md)

Life spent in happiness is the desire of all, and he who can give the
young a receipt for leading a happy life deserves to be popular among
them. Mere existence is not life; the art of living, truly, really, and
joyfully living, it is not given to all men to know. To teach men how to
live and how to die, is the aim of all useful religious instruction. The
rewards of,virtue are the baits with which the young are to be drawn to
morality. While we teach piety to God we should also dwell much upon
morality towards man.

[Psa 34:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#013.md)

"Keep thy tongue from evil." Guard with careful diligence that dangerous
member, the tongue, lest it utter evil, for that evil will recoil upon
thee, and mar the enjoyment of thy life. Men cannot spit forth poison
without feeling some of the venom burning their own flesh. "And thy lips
from speaking guile." Deceit must be very earnestly avoided by the man
who desires happiness. A crafty schemer lives like a spy in the enemy's
camp, in constant fear of exposure and execution. Clean and honest
conversation, by keeping the conscience at ease, promotes happiness, but
lying and wicked talk stuffs our pillow with thorns, and makes life a
constant whirl of fear and shame. David had tried the tortuous policy,
but he here denounces it, and begs others as they would live long and
well to avoid with care the doubtful devices of guile.

[Psa 34:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#014.md)

"Depart from evil." Go away from it. Not merely take your hands off, but
yourself off. Live not near the pest-house. Avoid the lion's lair, leave
the viper's nest. Set a distance between yourself and temptation. "And
do good." Be practical, active, energetic, persevering in good. Positive
virtue promotes negative virtue; he who does good is sure to avoid evil.
"Seek peace." Not merely prefer it, but with zeal and care endeavour to
promote it. Peace with God, with thine own heart, with thy fellow man,
search after this as the merchantman after a precious pearl. Nothing can
more effectually promote our own happiness than peace; strife awakens
passions which eat into the heart with corroding power. Anger is murder
to one's own self, as well as to its objects. "And pursue it." Hunt
after it, chase it with eager desire. It may soon be lost, indeed,
nothing is harder to retain, but do your best, and if enmity should
arise let it be no fault of yours. Follow after peace when it shuns you;
be resolved not to be of a contentious spirit. The peace which you thus
promote will be returned into your own bosom, and be a perennial spring
of comfort to you.

[Psalms 34:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 34:15</span></span>

15 The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open
unto their cry.

16 The face of the Lord is against them that do evil, to cut off the
remembrance of them from the earth.

17 The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth, and delivereth them out of
all their troubles,

18 The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth
such as be of a contrite spirit.

19 Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth
him out of them all.

20 He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.

21 Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be
desolate.

22 The Lord redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that
trust in him shall be desolate.

[Psa 34:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#015.md)

"The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous." He observes them with
approval and tender consideration; they are so dear to him that he
cannot take his eyes off them; he watches each one of them as carefully
and intently as if there were only that one creature in the universe.
"His ears are open unto their cry." His eyes and ears are thus both
turned by the Lord towards his saints; his whole mind is occupied about
them: if slighted by all others they are not neglected by him. Their cry
he hears at once, even as a mother is sure to hear her sick babe; the
cry may be broken, plaintive, unhappy, feeble, unbelieving, yet the
Father's quick ear catches each note of lament or appeal, and he is not
slow to answer his children's voice.

[Psa 34:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#016.md)

"The face of the Lord is against them that do evil." God is not
indifferent to the deeds of sinners, but he sets his face against them,
as we say, being determined that they shall have no countenance and
support, but shall be thwarted and defeated. He is determinately
resolved that the ungodly shall not prosper; he sets himself with all
his might to overthrow them. "To cut off the remembrance of them from
the earth." He will stamp out their fires, their honour shall be turned
into shame, their names forgotten or accursed. Utter destruction shall
be the lot of all the ungodly.

[Psa 34:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#017.md)

"The righteous cry." Like Israel in Egypt, they cry out under the heavy
yoke of oppression, both of sin, temptation, care and grief. "And the
Lord heareth;" he is like the night-watchman, who no sooner hears the
alarm-bell than he flies to relieve those who need him. "And delivereth
them out of all their troubles." No net of trouble can so hold us that
the Lord cannot free us. Our afflictions may be numerous and
complicated, but prayer can set us free from them all, for the Lord will
show himself strong on our behalf.

[Psa 34:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#018.md)

"The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart." Near in
friendship to accept and console. Broken hearts think God far away, when
he is really most near to them; their eyes are holden so that they see
not their best friend. Indeed, he is with them, and in them, but they
know it not. They run hither and thither, seeking peace in their own
works, or in experiences, or in proposals and resolutions, whereas the
Lord is nigh them, and the simple act of faith will reveal him. "And
sayeth such as be of a contrite spirit." What a blessed token for good
is a repentant, mourning heart! Just when the sinner condemns himself,
the Lord graciously absolves him. If we chasten our own spirits the Lord
will spare us. He never breaks with the rod of judgment those who are
already sore with the rod of conviction. Salvation is linked with
contrition.

[Psa 34:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#019.md)

"Many are the afflictions of the righteous." Thus are they made like
Jesus their covenant Head. Scripture does not flatter us like the story
books with the idea that goodness will secure us from trouble; on the
contrary, we are again and again warned to expect tribulation while we
are in this body. Our afflictions come from all points of the compass,
and are as many and as tormenting as the mosquitoes of the tropics. It
is the earthly portion of the elect to find thorns and briers growing in
their pathway, yea, to lie down among them, finding their rest broken
and disturbed by sorrow. But, blessed but, how it takes the sting out of
the previous sentence! "But the Lord delivereth him out of them all."
Through troops of ills Jehovah shall lead his redeemed scatheless and
triumphant. There is an end to the believer's affliction, and a joyful
end too. None of his trials can hurt so much as a hair of his head,
neither can the furnace hold him for a moment after the Lord bids him
come forth of it. Hard would be the lot of the righteous if this
promiser like a bundle of camphire, were not bound up in it, but this
sweetens all. The same Lord who sends the afflictions will also recall
them when his design is accomplished, but he will never allow the
fiercest of them to rend and devour his beloved.

[Psa 34:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#020.md)

"He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken." David had come
off with kicks and cuffs, but no broken bones. No substantial injury
occurs to the saints. Eternity will heal all their wounds. Their real
self is safe; they may have flesh-wounds, but no part of the essential
fabric of their being shall be broken. This verse may refer to frequent
providential protections vouchsafed to the saints; but as good men have
had broken limbs as well as others, it cannot absolutely be applied to
bodily preservations; but must, it seems to me, be spiritually applied
to great injuries of soul, which are for ever prevented by divine love.
Not a bone of the mystical body of Christ shall be broken, even as his
corporeal frame was preserved intact. Divine love watches over every
believer as it did over Jesus; no fatal injury shall happen to us, we
shall neither be halt nor maimed in the kingdom, but shall be presented
after life's trials are over without spot or wrinkle or any such thing,
being preserved in Christ Jesus, and kept by the power of God through
faith unto salvation.

[Psa 34:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#021.md)

"Evil shall slay the wicked." Their adversities shall be killing; they
are not medicine, but poison. Ungodly men only need rope enough and they
will hang themselves; their own iniquities shall be their punishment.
Hell itself is but evil fully developed, torturing those in whom it
dwells. Oh! happy they who have fled to Jesus to find refuge from their
former sins, such, and such only will escape. "And they that hate the
righteous shall be desolate." They hated the best of company, and they
shall have none; they shall be forsaken, despoiled, wretched,
despairing. God makes the viper poison itself. What desolation of heart
do the damned feel, and how richly have they deserved it!

[Psa 34:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#022.md)

"The Lord redeemeth the soul of his servants." - with price and with
power, with blood and with water. All providential helps are a part of
the redemption by power, hence the Lord is said still to redeem. All
thus ransomed belong to him who bought them - this is the law of justice
and the verdict of gratitude. Joyfully will we serve him who so
graciously purchases us with his blood, and delivers us by his power.
"And none of them that trust in him shall be desolate." Faith is the
mark of the ransomed, and wherever it is seen, though in the least and
meanest of the saints, it ensures eternal salvation. Believer, thou
shalt never be deserted, forsaken, given up to ruin. God, even thy God
is thy guardian and friend, and bliss is thine.
