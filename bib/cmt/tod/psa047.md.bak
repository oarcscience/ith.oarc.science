### [Psalms Chapter 47](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 47:0</span></span>

Title - To the chief Musician - Many songs were dedicated to this leader
of the chorus, but he was not overloaded thereby. God's service is such
delight that it cannot weary us; and that choicest part of it, the
singing of his praises, is so pleasurable that we cannot have too much
of it. Doubtless, the chief musician, as he was commissioned with so
many sacred songs, felt that the more the merrier. A Psalm for the Sons
of Korah. We cannot agree with those who think that the sons of Korah
were the authors of these Psalms: they have all the indication of
David's authorship that one could expect to see. Our ear has grown
accustomed to the ring of David's compositions, and we are morally
certain that we hear it in this Psalm. Every expert would detect here
the autograph of the Son of Jesse, or we are greatly mistaken. The sons
of Korah sang these Psalms but we believe they did not write them. Fit
singers were they whose origin reminded them of sin, whose existence was
a proof of sovereign grace, and whose name has a close connection with
the name of Calvary.

Subject - Whether the immediate subject of this Psalm be the carrying up
of the ark from the house of Obededom to Mount Zion, or the celebration
of some memorable victory, it would be hard to decide. As even the
doctors differ, who shall dogmatise? But it is very clear that both the
present sovereignty of Jehovah, and the final victories of our Lord, are
here filly hymned, while his ascension, as the prophecy of them, is
sweetly gloried in.

Division - In so short a Psalm, there is no need of any other division
than that indicated by the musical pause at the end of [Psa
47:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#004.md).

Hints to Preachers

[Psa 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#001.md) - Unusual and enthusiastic
expressions of joy when justifiable and even desirable.

[Psa 47:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#001.md) - Joy the true spirit of
worship.

1\. Joy in God's character.

2\. In his reign.

3\. In the triumphs of his gospel.

4\. In his favour to his saints.

[Psa 47:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#002.md) - The terrors of the Lord
viewed by faith as a subject of joy.

[Psa 47:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#002) (second clause.md) - The
universal reign of Christ as it is and is to be.

[Psa 47:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#003.md) - The hope of victory to the
church. What shall be subdued? By whose instrumentality? "Us." By whose
power? "He." When it shall be accomplished? What is the token of it? The
ascension, [Psa 47:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#005.md).

[Psa 47:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#003.md) -

I. The final triumph of the saints. All enemies subdued under them in
earth and hell, within and without.

1\. Gradually.

2\. Completely.

II\. The power by which it is accomplished. - "He shall," etc.

1\. Not without means.

2\. Not by means only.

3\. But by appointed means made potent by divine energy.

\- G. R.

[Psa 47:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#004.md) - This comprehends time and
eternity. It is a matter of fact, of holy acquiescence, of desire, of
thankfulness.

[Psa 47:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#004.md) -

I. God is willing to choose our inheritance for us in time and eternity.

II\. His choice is better than ours - "the excellency of Jacob."

III\. He will leave us to the consequences of our own choice.

IV\. He will help us in obtaining that which he chooses for us.

\- G. R.

[Psa 47:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#005.md) - The ascension. Its
publicity, solemnity, triumph, joy. Who went up. Where he went up. To
what he went up. For what purpose. With what result.

[Psa 47:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#006.md) - The importance of holy
song. The repetition rebukes our slackness, and implies that
earnestness, frequency, delight, and universality should characterise
the praises offered.

[Psa 47:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#007) (last clause.md) - The Psalmody
of the instructed, and instruction by Psalmody; praise should be both
the fruit and the vehicle of teaching.

[Psa 47:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#008) (last clause.md) - Divine
sovereignty always connected with holiness.

[Psa 47:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#008.md) -

I. God has a throne of holiness, for which he is to be feared by all
men.

II\. A throne of grace, for which he is to be loved by his redeemed.

III\. A throne of glory, for which he is to be praised by his whole
creation.

[Psa 47:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#009.md) -

I. A shield is a merciful weapon, none more so.

II\. A shield is a venturous weapon, a kind of surety, which bears the
blows and receives the injuries which were intended for another.

III\. A shield is a strong weapon, to repel the darts of wickedness and
break them in pieces.

IV\. A shield is an honourable weapon, none more: taking away of shields
was a sign of victory; preserving them a sign of glory.

V. Remember, a shield must ever have an eye to guide it - you the
shields, the law the eye.

\- Bishop Reynolds.

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Whole Psalm

Some have applied this Psalm to Christ's ascension; but it speaks of his
Second Coming. The Mighty One is seated peacefully on his throne. We are
referred back to Psalm 45. - Andrew A. Bonar.

[Psa 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#001.md)

"O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of
triumph." This should be done, 1. Cheerfully: "Clap your hands," for
this is a sign of inward joy, [Nah
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#019.md). 2. Universally: "O clap your
hands, all ye people." 3. Vocally: "Shout unto God with the voice of
triumph." 4. Frequently: "Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing
praises unto our King, sing praises," [Psa
47:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#006.md); and again "sing praises," [Psa
47:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#007.md). It cannot be done too
frequently. 5. Knowingly and discreetly: "Sing ye praises with
understanding;" know the reason why ye are to praise him. - Adam Clarke.

[Psa 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#001.md)

"O clap your hands," etc. Such expressions of pious and devout affection
as to some may seem indecent and imprudent, yet ought not to be hastily
censured and condemned, much less ridiculed; because if they come from
an upright heart, God will accept the strength of the affection, and
excuse the weakness of the expressions of it. - Matthew Henry.

[Psa 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#001.md)

"O clap your hands." The voice of melody is not so much to be uttered
with the tongue or with the hands; that is, it is our deeds not our
words, by which God is here to be praised. Even as it was in him whose
pattern we are to follow: "Jesus began both to do and to teach." - J. M.
Neale.

[Psa 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#001.md)

"All ye people." Peoples, in the plural. Here it is used to call both
Jews and Gentile - all nations. - William S. Plumer

[Psa 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#001.md)

"Shout unto God." Jubilate Deo: in God, and concerning God, and in
honour of God. He does not excite them to carnal joy. - Martin Geier.

[Psa 47:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#002.md)

"For the Lord most high is terrible; he is a great king over all the
earth." The church celebrates the ascension of Christ, because then he
was "highly exalted;" then he became "terrible" to his enemies, all
power in heaven and in earth being committed to him; and then he began
to display the excellent majesty of his universal kingdom, to which he
was then inaugurated, being crowned "King of kings, and Lord of lords."
- George Horne.

[Psa 47:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#002.md)

"The Lord most high is terrible." Christ is "terrible," that is,
fearful, or meet to be feared, not of his children only for their good,
but of the wicked also for their punishment; "terrible" to the devil, as
being stronger than he, casting out the prince of darkness by the finger
of God. [Luk 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#022.md); [Joh
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031.md). And therefore so soon as an
unclean spirit saw Jesus, he cried out, "What have we to do with thee,
thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us?" [Mar
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#024.md); or as other devils, [Mat
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#029.md), "Art thou come hither to torment
us before the time?" for the devils in believing tremble. "Terrible" to
hypocrites, and other impious agents of the devil, as having his fan in
his hand to make clean his floor, and to gather his wheat into his
garner, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire. [Mat
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#012.md). Or Christ is excelsus in
potentia, terribilis in justitia; high in power, and fearful ill
justice: high in exalting the good, and terrible in humbling the bad. -
John Boys.

[Psa 47:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#003.md)

"He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet."
The consequence of our Lord's ascension was the going forth of the
all-subduing Word, under the influence and direction of which the
convinced and converted nations renounced their idols and their lusts,
and bowed their willing necks to the yoke of Jesus. This is that great
conquest, foreshowed by the victories of Joshua, David, and all the
faithful heroes of old time, and foretold in language borrowed from
their history. - George Horne.

[Psa 47:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#003.md)

"He shall subdue the people under us," etc., or he shall lead like
sheep; or bring unto the fold; as divers render the word, by comparing
[Isa 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#017.md); [Mic
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012.md). He seems to speak of such a
subjugation of them, as was for the good of the people subdued, because
this is matter of rejoicing to them, [Psa
47:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#001.md); which is true both of these
people whom David subdued, who thereby had opportunities, obligations,
and encouragements to own and worship the true God, which was the only
way to their true and lasting happiness; and especially of those
Gentiles who were subdued to Christ by the preaching of the gospel. The
Gentile converts were in some sort brought under the Jews, because they
were subjected to Christ and to his apostles, and to the primitive
church, which were Jews. - Matthew Pool.

[Psa 47:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#003.md)

"And the nations under our feet." By this manner of speech is meant,
that the Gentiles should be scholars, and the Jews schoolmasters, as it
were to them; for to sit under the feet, or at the feet, is used in
Scripture for being a scholar, or learning, as [Act
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#003.md). - Thomas Wilcocks.

[Psa 47:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#004.md)

"He shall choose." Futures are variously rendered; and accordingly the
vulgar Latin, Syriac, and Arabic, render this word, He hath chosen. -
Matthew Pool.

[Psa 47:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#004.md)

"He shall choose our inheritance for us." It is reported of a woman who,
being sick, was asked whether she was willing to live or die; she
answered, "Which God pleases." But, said one, if God should refer it to
you, which would you choose? "Truly," replied she, "I would refer it to
him again." Thus that man obtains his will of God, whose will is
subjected to God. We are not to be troubled that we have no more front
God, but we are to be troubled that we do no more for God. Christians,
if the Lord be well pleased with your persons, should not you be well
pleased with your conditions? There is more reason that you should be
pleased with them, than that he should be pleased with you. Believers
should be like sheep, which change their pastures at the will of the
shepherd; or like vessels in a house, which stand to be filled or
emptied at the pleasure of their owner. He that sails upon the sea of
this world in his own bottom, will sink at last into a bottomless ocean.
Never were any their own carvers, but they were sure to cut their own
fingers. - William Seeker.

[Psa 47:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#004.md)

"He shall choose our inheritance for us," means that he who knows what
is better for us than ourselves, hath chosen, that is, hath appointed,
and that of his own good will and mercy towards us, our inheritance; not
only things meet for this life as lands, and houses, and possessions,
etc., but even all other things concerning the hope of a better life, to
wit, a kingdom that cannot be shaken, an everlasting habitation, an
inheritance which is immortal and undefiled, and fadeth not away,
reserved for us in heaven. - John Boys.

[Psa 47:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#004.md)

"The excellency (or glory) of Jacob whom he loved;" that is, even all
those excellent things that he gave and promised to Jacob, wherein he
might glory and rejoice. The faithful mean, that they had as great, both
abundance and assurance of God's grace and goodness, as ever Jacob had.
- Thomas Wilcocks.

[Psa 47:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#004.md)

It may be thou art godly and poor. 'Tis well; but canst thou tell
whether, if thou wert not poor, thou wouldst be godly? Surely God knows
us better than we ourselves do, and therefore can best fit the estate to
the person. - Giles Fletcher.

[Psa 47:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#005.md)

"God is gone up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a trumpet." It
is worthy (as Origen suggests) that this mention of the "shout," and the
voice of the "trumpet," serves to connect together past and future
events in the history of the church and of the world, and carry our
thoughts forward to Christ's coming to judgment. - Christopher
Wordsworth.

[Psa 47:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#005.md)

Thou hast great cause, O my soul, to praise him, and to rejoice before
him, especially if thou considerest that Christ ascended not for
himself, but also for thee: it is God in our nature that is gone up to
heaven: whatever God acted on the person of Christ, that he did as in
thy behalf, and he means to act the very same on thee. Christ as a
public person ascended up to heaven; thy interest is in this very
ascension of Jesus Christ; and therefore dost thou consider thy Head as
soaring up? O let every member praise his name; let thy tongue (called
thy glory),:glory in this, and trumpet out his praise, that in respect
of thy duty it may be verified: "Christ is gone up with a shout, the
Lord with the sound of a trumpet." - Isaac Ambrose.

[Psa 47:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#007.md)

"For God is the King of all the earth:" as if he had said, "Our King,
said I? it is too little; he is King of all the earth." - John Trapp.

[Psa 47:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#007.md)

"Sing ye praises with understanding." How may we make melody in our
hearts to God in singing of Psalms? We must sing "with understanding."
We must not be guided by the time, but the words of the Psalm; we must
mind the matter more than the music, and consider what we sing, as well
as how we sing; the tune may affect the fancy, but it is the matter
affects the heart, and that God principally eyes. The Psalmist adviseth
us in this particular, and so doth the apostle ([Co1
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#015).md). Otherwise this sweet duty
would be more the work of a chorister than of a Christian, and we should
be more delighted in an anthem of the musician's making, than in a Psalm
of the Spirit's making. A Lapide observes that in the text, [Co1
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#015.md), the word understanding is
maschil, משׂכּיל, profound judgment: we must sing wisely, if we will
sing gratefully; we must relish what we sing. In a word, we must sing as
we must pray; now the most rude petitioner will understand what he
prays. [Co1 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#015.md). If we do not
understand what we sing, it argues carelessness of spirit, or hardness
of heart; and this makes the service impertinent. Upon this the worthy
Davenant cries out, "Adieu to the bellowing of the Papists, who sing in
an unknown tongue." God will not understand us in that service which we
understand not ourselves. One of the first pieces of the creation was
light, and this must break out in every duty. - John Wells (-1676), in
"Morning Exercises."

[Psa 47:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#007.md)

"Sing ye praises with understanding," sing an instructive song. Let
sense and sound go together. Let your hearts and heads go with your
voices. Understand what you sing, and feel what you understand. - Adam
Clarke.

[Psa 47:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#007.md)

"Sing ye praises with understanding;" because in the full light of the
new dispensation, the darkness of the patriarchal ages, the seeing as
through a glass of the Levitical law, are turned into the vision of full
and very reality. - Hugo Victorinus.

[Psa 47:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#007.md)

"Sing ye praises with understanding." Mark this, thou who daily readest
the Psalms, and yet dost not understand them. - Simon de Muis.

[Psa 47:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#007.md)

"With understanding." If they had sung "with understanding," they had
not adored stones. When a man sensible sang to a stone insensible, did
he sing "with understanding"? But now, brethren, we see not with our
eyes whom we adore, and yet correctly we adore. Much more is God
commended to us, that with our eyes we see him not. - Augustine.

[Psa 47:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#009.md)

"The princes of the people are gathered together." I note from hence, 1.
That it is not impossible for great men to be good men; for the heads of
a country to be members of Christ; and for princes as well as the people
to serve the God of Abraham. It is said by the prophet, "upon my peace
came great bitterness; "a thousand fall on the left hand, but ten
thousand at the right hand" ([Psa
91:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#007).md): ten perish in their prosperity,
for one that falleth in adversity. Homo victus in paradiso, victor in
stercore: Adam in the garden of pleasure was overcome by the subtle
serpent, whereas Job on the dunghill of misery was more than a
conqueror. Woodmen say that deer are more circumspect in fat pastures;
so the godly fear most in a rich estate: nihil timendum video (saith
one), timeo tamen. It is a sweet prayer of our church in the Litany.
"Good Lord, deliver us in all time of our wealth," insinuating that our
minds are not so wanton in want as in abundance: yet, as you see, such
is Christ's unspeakable goodness towards all sorts of men, in preventing
them even with the riches of his mercy, that not only the mean people,
but also the mighty princes among the heathen are joined unto the church
of the God of Abraham. - John Boys.

[Psa 47:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#009.md)

"Gathered together." Christ's gathering of the saints together unto him
will be at his second coming, his coming to judgment, the general and
final judgment. "Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord
Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him." [Th2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#001). - James Scot ( - 1773.md), in "A
Collection of Sermons," 1774.

[Psa 47:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#009.md)

"The people of the God of Abraham." First, touching the God of Abraham,
it is Christ, whose day Abraham desired to see, and in seeing whereof he
did so much rejoice (John 8); that is, not only the day of his birth,
which he saw, as we learn by the oath which he caused his servant to
take (Gen. 24), but also the day of his passion, which he saw long ago,
and rejoiced in seeing it, when he said to his son Isaac in the mount,
"The Lord will provide a sacrifice." [Gen
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#008.md). Secondly, "The people of the God
of Abraham," are his children and posterity: not only they that are the
seed of Abraham, coming out of his loins, and are "the children of the
flesh" ([Rom 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#009).md); but "the children
of the promise;" for if they that come out of Abraham's loins were only
his children, then the Hagarins, the Turks, and Ishmaelites should be
the people of God; "But in Isaac shall thy seed be called." They that
lay hold of the promise by faith, "They that are of the faith, are the
children of Abraham" ([Gal 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#007).md), that
have the same spirit of faith that Abraham had. As the apostle saith
([Rom 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#028).md), "He is not a Jew that is
one outwardly, but a Jew inwardly is the true Jew." They that worship
the Messiah by believing in him with the faith of Abraham, they are
Abraham's children, and the people of Abraham's God, which thing John
Baptist affirmeth (Matt. 3), "God can of stones raise up children to
Abraham." So the Gentiles, which worshipped stones, and therefore were
"like unto them" (Psalm 115), were notwithstanding raised up to be
children to Abraham. - Lancelot Andrews.

[Psa 47:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#009.md)

"The shields of the earth belong unto God." There we have the rulers of
the earth set forth by a double relation; the one upward, they are scuta
Deo, they belong to God; the other downward, they are scuta terrae, "the
shields of the earth;" and both these noting two things, their dignity
and their duty. They belong to God, it is their honour that he hath
sealed them: they belong to God, it is their duty to be subject to him.
They are "shields of the earth," it is their honour that they are above
others: they are "the shields of the earth," it is their duty to protect
others. - Edward Reynolds (Bishop).

[Psa 47:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#009.md)

"The shields of the earth are God's," is understood by many as spoken of
princes. I admit that this metaphor is of frequent occurrence in
Scripture, nor does this sense seem to be unsuitable to the scope of the
passage.... Yet the sense will be more simple if we explain the words
thus: That, as it is God alone who defends and preserves the world, the
high and supreme majesty which is sufficient for so exalted and
difficult a work as the preservation of the world, is justly looked upon
with admiration. The sacred writer expressly uses the word shields in
the plural number, for, considering the various and almost innumerable
dangers which unceasingly threaten every part of the world, the
providence of God must necessarily interpose in many ways, and make use
as it were, of many bucklers. - John Calvin.

[Psa 47:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#009.md)

"The shields of the earth." Magistrates are said to bear the sword, not
to be swords; and they are said to be shields, not to bear shields, and
all this to show that protection and preservation are more essential and
intrinsical to their office than destruction and punishment are. -
Joseph Caryl.

[Psalms 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 47:1</span></span>

1 Clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of
triumph.

"O clap your hands." The most natural and most enthusiastic tokens of
exultation are to be used in view of the victories of the Lord, and his
universal reign. Our joy in God may be demonstrative, and yet he will
not censure it. "All ye people." The joy is to extend to all nations;
Israel may lead the van, but all the Gentiles are to follow in the march
of triumph, for they have an equal share in that Kingdom where there is
neither Greek nor Jew, but Christ is all and in all. Even now if they
did but know it, it is the best hope of all nations that Jehovah ruleth
over them. If they cannot all speak the same tongue, the symbolic
language of the hands they can all use. All people will be ruled by the
Lord in the latter days, and will exult in that rule; were they wise
they would submit to it now, and rejoice to do so; yea, they would clap
their hands in rapture at the thought. "Shout," let your voices keep
tune with your hands. "Unto God," let him have all the honours of the
day, and let them be loud, joyous, universal, and undivided. "With the
voice of triumph," with gladsome sounds, consonant with such splendid
victories, so great a King, so excellent a rule, and such gladsome
subjects. Many are human languages, and yet the nations may triumph as
with one voice. Faith's view of God's government is full of transport.
The prospect of the universal reign of the Prince of Peace is enough to
make the tongue of the dumb sing; what will the reality be? Well might
the poet of the seasons bid mountains and valleys raise their joyous
hymn -

"For the Great Shepherd reigns,

And his unsuffering kingdom yet will come."

[Psalms 47:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 47:2</span></span>

2 For the Lord most high is terrible; he is a great King over all the
earth.

"For the Lord," or Jehovah, the self-existent and only God; "Most high,"
most great in power, lofty in dominion, eminent in wisdom, elevated in
glory. "Is terrible," none can resist his power or stand before his
vengeance; yet as these terrors are wielded on the behalf of his
subjects, they are fit reasons for rejoicing. Omnipotence, which is
terrible to crush, is almighty to protect. At a grand review of the
troops of a great prince, all his loyal subjects are filled with
triumph, because their liege lord is so able to defend his own, and so
much dreaded by his foes. "He is a great King over all the earth." Not
over Judea only, but even to the utmost isles his reign extends. Our God
is no local deity, no petty ruler of a tribe; in infinite majesty he
rules the mightiest realms as absolute arbiter of destiny, sole monarch
of all lands, King of kings and Lord of lords. Not a hamlet or an islet
is excluded from his dominion. How glorious will that era be when this
is seen and known of all; when in the person of Jesus all flesh shall
behold the glory of the Lord!

[Psalms 47:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 47:3</span></span>

3 He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet.

"He," with whom is infinite power, "shall subdue the people under us."
The battle is not ours but the Lord's. He will take his own time, but he
will certainly achieve victory for his church. Truth and righteousness
shall through grace climb to the ascendant. We wage no doubtful warfare.
Hearts the most rebellious, and wills the most stubborn, shall submit to
all-conquering grace. All the Lord's people, Whether Jews or Gentiles,
may clap their hands at this, for God's victory will be theirs; but
surely apostles, prophets, ministers, and those who suffer and labour
most, may take the largest share in the joy. Idolatry, infidelity,
superstition we shall yet tread upon, as men tread down the stones of
the street. "And the nations under our feet." The church of God shall be
the greatest of monarchies, her victory shall be signal and decisive.
Christ shall take to himself his great power and reign, and all the
tribes of men shall own at once his glory and the glory of his people in
him. How changed will be the position of affairs in coming ages! The
people of God have been under the feet of men in long and cruel
persecutions, and in daily contempt; but God will reverse the position,
and the best in character shall be first in honour.

4 He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom
he loved. Selah.

While as yet we see not all things put under him, we are glad to put
ourselves and our fortunes at his disposal. "He shall choose our
inheritance for us." We feel his reign to be so gracious that we even
now ask to be in the fullest degree the subjects of it. We submit our
will, our choice, our desire, wholly to him. Our heritage here and
hereafter we leave to him, let him do with us as seemeth him good. "The
excellence of Jacob whom he loved." He gave his ancient people their
portion, he will give us ours, and we ask nothing better; this is the
most spiritual and real manner of clapping our hands because of his
sovereignty, namely, to leave all our affairs in his hands, for then our
hands are empty of all care for self, and free to be used in his honour.
He was the boast and glory of Israel, he is and shall be ours. He loved
his people and became their greatest glory; he loves us, and he shall be
our exceeding joy. As for the latter days, we ask nothing better than to
stand in our appointed lot, for if we have but a portion in our Lord
Jesus, it is enough for our largest desires. Our beauty, our boast, our
best treasure, lies in having such a God to trust in, such a God to love
us.

Selah. Yes, pause, ye faithful songsters. Here is abundant room for holy
meditation -

"Muse awhile, obedient thought,

Lo, the theme's with rapture fraught;

See thy King, whose realm extends

E'en to earth's remotest ends!

Gladly shall the nations own

Him their Lord and God alone;

Clap their hands with holy mirth,

Hail him Monarch of the Earth.

Come, my soul, before him bow,

Gladdest of his subjects thou;

Leave thy portion to his choice,

In his sovereign will rejoice.

This thy purest, deepest bliss,

He is thine and thou art his."

5 God is gone up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a trumpet

"God is gone up with a shout." Faith hears the people already shouting
command of the first verse is here regarded as a fact. The fight is
over, the conqueror ascends to his triumphal chariot, and rides up to
the gates of the city which is made resplendent with the joy of his
return. The words are fully applicable to the ascension of the Redeemer.
We doubt not that angels and glorified spirits welcomed him with
acclamations. He came not without song, shall we imagine that he
returned in silence? "The Lord with the sound of a trumpet." Jesus is
Jehovah. The joyful strain of the trumpet betokens the splendour of his
triumph. It was meet to welcome one returning from the wars with martial
music. Fresh from Bozrah, with his garments all red from the winepress,
he ascended, leading captivity captive, and well might the clarion ring
out the tidings of Immanuel's victorious return.

[Psalms 47:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 47:6</span></span>

6 Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King, sing
praises.

"Sing praises." What jubilation is here, when five times over the whole
earth is called upon to sing to God! He is worthy, he is Creator, he is
goodness itself Sing praises, keep on with the glad work. Never let the
music pause. He never ceases to be good, let us never cease to be
grateful. Strange that we should need so much urging to attend to so
heavenly an exercise. "Sing praises unto our King." Let him have all our
praise; no one ought to have even a particle of it. Jesus shall have it
all. Let his sovereignty be the fount of gladness. It is a sublime
attribute, but full of bliss to the faithful. Let our homage be paid not
in groans but in songs. He asks not slaves to grace his throne; he is no
despot; singing is fit homage for a monarch so blessed and gracious. Let
all hearts that own his sceptre sing and sing on for ever, for there is
everlasting reason for thanksgiving while we dwell under the shadow of
such a throne.

[Psalms 47:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 47:7</span></span>

7 For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with
understanding.

"For God is the King of all the earth." The Jews of our Saviour's time
resented this truth, but had their hearts been right they would have
rejoiced in it. They would have kept their God to themselves, and not
even have allowed the Gentile dogs to eat the crumbs from under his
table. Alas! how selfishness turns honey into wormwood. Jehovah is not
the God of the Jews only, all the nations of the earth are, through the
Messiah, yet to own him Lord. Meanwhile his providential throne governs
all events beneath the sky. "Sing ye praises with understanding." Sing a
didactic Psalm. Sound doctrine praises God. Even under the economy of
types and ceremonies, it is clear that the Lord had regard to the
spirituality of worship, and would be praised thoughtfully,
intelligently, and with deep appreciation of the reason for song, It is
to be feared from the slovenly way in which some make a noise in
singing, that they fancy any sound will do. On the other hand, from the
great attention paid by some to the mere music, we feel sadly sure that
the sense has no effect upon them. Is it not a sin to be tickling men's
ears with sounds when we profess to be adoring the Lord? What has a
sensuous delight in organs, anthems, etc., to do with devotion? Do not
men mistake physical effects for spiritual impulses? Do they not often
offer to God strains far more calculated for human amusement than for
divine acceptance? An understanding enlightened of the Holy Spirit is
then and then only fully capable of offering worthy praise.

[Psalms 47:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 47:8</span></span>

8 God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of his
holiness.

Now at this moment, over the most debased idolaters, God holds a secret
rule; here is work for faith. How we ought to long for the day when this
truth shall be changed in its aspect, and the rule now unrecognized
shall be delighted in! The great truth that God reigneth in providence
is the guarantee that in a gracious gospel sense his promise shall be
fulfilled, and his kingdom shall come. "He sitteth upon the throne of
his holiness." Unmoved he occupies an undisputed throne, whose decrees,
acts, and commands are holiness itself. What other throne is like this?
Never was it stained with injustice, or defiled with sin. Neither is he
who sits upon it dismayed, or in a dilemma. He sits in serenity, for he
knows his own power, and sees that his purposes will not miscarry. Here
is reason enough for holy song.

[Psalms 47:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 47:9</span></span>

9 The princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of
the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth belong unto God: he is
greatly exalted.

"The princes of the people are gathered together." The prophetic eye of
the Psalmist sees the willing subjects of the great King assembled to
celebrate his glory. Not only the poor and the men of low estate are
there, but nobles bow their willing necks to his sway. "All kings shall
bow down before him." No people shall be unrepresented; their great men
shall be good men, their royal ones regenerate ones. How august will be
the parliament where the Lord Jesus shall open the court, and princes
shall rise up to do him honour! "Even the people of the God of Abraham."
That same God, who was known only to here and there a patriarch like the
father of the faithful, shall be adored by a seed as many as the stars
of heaven. The covenant promise shall be fulfilled, "In thee and in thy
seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed." Shiloh shall come,
and "to him shall the gathering of the people be." Babel's dispersion
shall be obliterated by the gathering arm of the Great Shepherd King.

"For the shields of the earth belong unto God." The insignia of pomp,
the emblems of rank, the weapons of war, all must pay loyal homage to
the King of all. Right honourables must honour Jesus, and majesties must
own him to be far more majestic. Those who are earth's protectors, the
shields of the commonwealth, derive their might from him, and are his.
All principalities and powers must be subject unto Jehovah and his
Christ, for "He is greatly exalted." In nature, in power, in character,
in glory, there is none to compare with him. Oh, glorious vision of a
coming era! Make haste, ye wheels of time! Meanwhile, ye saints, "Be ye
stedfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch
as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord."
