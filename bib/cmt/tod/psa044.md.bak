### [Psalms Chapter 44](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 44:0</span></span>

Title - To the Chief Musician for the sons of Korah, Maschil - The title
is similar to the [Psa 42:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md), and
although this is no proof that it is by the same author it makes it
highly probable. No other writer should be sought for to father any of
the Psalms when David will suffice, and therefore we are loth to ascribe
this sacred song to any but the great Psalmist, yet as we hardly know
any period of his tile which it would fairly describe, we feel compelled
to look elsewhere. Some Israelitish patriot fallen on evil times, sings
in mingled faith and sorrow, his country's ancient glory and her present
griefs, her traditions of former favour and her experience of pressing
ills. By Christians it can best be understood if put into the mouth of
the church when persecution is peculiarly severe. The last verses remind
us of Milton's famous lines on the Massacre of the Protestants among the
mountains of Piedmont.

The song before us is fitted for the voices of the saved by grace, the
sons of Korah, and is to them and to all others full of teaching, hence
the title Maschil.

Division - From [Psa 44:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#001.md), the Lord's
mighty works for Israel are rehearsed, and in remembrance of them faith
in the Lord is expressed [Psa 44:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#004.md).
Then the notes of complaint are heard [Psa
44:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#009.md), the fidelity of the people to
their God is avowed, [Psa 44:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#017.md), and
the Lord is entreated to interpose, [Psa
44:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#023.md).

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Whole Psalm

On a survey of this Psalm, it would seem not to admit of a doubt that
the speakers are of the race of Israel; and yet expositors for the most
part have found much difficulty in so understanding it, in this - the
natural sense - so as even to be compelled to abandon it, owing to the
impossibility of fixing on any period in the history of that people
which would furnish an occasion for it, and verify its language. Thus,
it cannot be referred to the times of the Babylonish captivity; for to
this it is objected, and with reason, first, that [Psa
44:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#011.md) and [Psa
44:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#014.md)represent the speakers as
"scattered among the nations," and "a byword among the peoples," whereas
their exile was then confined to one country; and, secondly, that in
[Psa 44:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#017.md) there is an assertion of
faithful adherence to the worship of the true God, which he is called to
witness as acquitting the sufferers of having brought the evil on
themselves, while that captivity was a punishment of the nation for
their apostasy, and especially for the grievous sin of idolatry. And the
same objections lie to interpreting it with reference to the times of
Antiochus Epiphanes and the Maccabees; beside that, the history of the
canon of Scripture is decisive against assigning so late a date to any
of the Psalms. Still less can the times of David be looked to for the
occasion, since, though religion was then pure, there was, on the other
hand, no dispersion of the nation nor any calamity such as to warrant
the lamentation, "Thou hast cast us off, and put us to shame.... Thou
hast given us like sheep appointed for meat," etc. Whence it appeared
that there was no alternative but to consider the Psalm as exclusively
the language of the Christian church, and, in her primitive days, as the
period at once of her greatest purity and suffering. - William de Burgh.

Whole Psalm

S. Ambrose observes, that in former Psalms we have seen a prophecy of
Christ's passion, resurrection, and ascension, and of the coming of the
Holy Ghost, and that here we are taught that we ourselves must be ready
to struggle and suffer, in order that these things may profit us. Human
will must work together with divine grace. - Christopher Wordsworth.

[Psa 44:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#001.md)

"We have heard with our ears," i.e., we have both heard and heeded it,
with utmost attention and affection. It is not a pleonasmus, but an
emphasis that is here used. - John Trapp.

[Psa 44:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#001.md)

"Our fathers have told us." Hear this, saith Basil, ye fathers that
neglect to teach your children such things as may work his fear and love
in them, and faith to rely upon and seek to him in all times of danger.
They made their mouths, as it were, books, wherein the mighty deeds of
the Lord might be read to his praise, and to the drawing of their
children's hearts unto him. - John Mayer.

[Psa 44:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#001.md)

"What work thou didst." Why only "work" in the singular, when such
innumerable deliverances had been wrought by him, from the passage of
the Red Sea to the destruction of the hundred and eighty-five thousand
in the camp of the Assyrians? Because all these were but types of that
one great work, that one stretching forth of the Lord's hand, when Satan
was vanquished, death destroyed, and the kingdom of heaven opened to all
believers. - Ambrose.

[Psa 44:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#001.md)

"What work thou didst." While the songs of other nations sing of the
heroism of their ancestors, the songs of Israel celebrate the works of
God. - Augustus F. Tholuck.

[Psa 44:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#001.md)

Three necessary requirements for learning well: 1. Intention and
attention in him who learns, "we have heard with our ears." 2. Authority
in him that teaches, "our fathers have told us." 3. Love between the
teacher and the taught, "our fathers." - Hugo (Cardinal), quoted in
Neale's Commentary.

[Psa 44:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#001.md), [Psa
44:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#002.md), [Psa
44:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#004.md), [Psa
44:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#008.md)

Children are their parents' heirs; it were unnatural for a father before
he dies to bury up his treasure in the earth, where his children should
not find or enjoy it; now the mercies of God are not the least part of
his treasure, nor the least of his children's inheritance, being both
helps to their faith, matter for their praise, and spurs to their
obedience. "Our fathers have told us, what work thou didst in their
days, how thou didst drive out the heathen," etc. ([Psa
44:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#001.md), [Psa
44:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#002).md); from this they ground their
confidence; [Psa 44:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#004.md) : "Thou art my
King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob;" and excite their
thankfulness, [Psa 44:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#008.md) : "In God we
boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever." Indeed, as
children are their parents' heirs, so they become in justice liable to
pay their parents' debts; now the great debt which the saint at death
stands charged with, is that which he owes to God for his mercies, and,
therefore it is but reason he should tie his posterity to the payment
thereof. Thus mayest thou be praising God in heaven and earth at the
same time. - William Gurnall.

[Psa 44:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#002.md)

Thou with thine hand, hast driven out heathen,

And hast planted them;

The nations thou hast broken down,

But them thou hast engrafted.

The two clauses of this verse stand in regular contrast. The first has
the figure, of rooting out one kind of tree, and planting another, as
the Canaanites were rooted out of Palestine, and Israel was planted in
their stead (Compare [Psa 80:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#008).md). The
second figure is that of cutting off bad branches, and engrafting others
in their place, in the same root, which is Palestine again. - Benjamin
Weiss.

[Psa 44:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#003.md)

"They got not the land in possession by their own sword." The Lord's
part in a work is best seen when man's part, and all that he as an
instrument hath done, or could have done in it, is declared null; being
considered as separate from God who moved the instruments, and did work
by them what he pleased. - David Dickson.

[Psa 44:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#003.md)

"Because thou hadst a favour unto them." Free grace was the fundamental
cause of all their felicity. God loved them because he loved them. [Deu
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#007.md). He chose them of his love, and
then loved them for his choice. - John Trapp.

[Psa 44:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#003.md)

God's love to Israel was free, unmerited, and amazing, and he gave them
a land for which they did not labour, and cities which they built not,
and vineyards and oliveyards which they planted not. [Jos
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#013.md). In some cases neither sword nor
bow were used, but hornets were the instruments of conquest. [Jos
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#012.md). Since the fall of Adam all good
things in the lot of any mere man are undeserved kindnesses. - William
S. Plumer.

[Psa 44:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#003) (last clause.md)

The prophet does not suppose any worthiness in the person of Abraham,
nor imagine any desert in his posterity, on account of which God dealt
so bountifully with them; but ascribes the whole to the good pleasure of
God..... Nor does the Psalmist here treat of the general benevolence of
God, which extends to the whole human race: but he discourses of the
difference which exists between the elect and the rest of the world, and
the cause of this difference is here referred to the mere good pleasure
of God. - John Calvin.

[Psa 44:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#004.md)

"My king;" apparently with a personal application to himself, the poet
individually claiming his own place in the covenant between God and his
people. - J. J. Stewart Perowne.

[Psa 44:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#004.md)

"Thou art my king, O God; command deliverances for Jacob. If there were
no creature, no instrument in the world to help, yet would you not be at
a loss in time of need, for he that is on the throne could do it alone.
He can do all that ever you need, without any means or instruments. His
bare word is sufficient, all-sufficient, for it, whatever it be, how
great, how difficult, how impossible soever it seems. Such a power there
is even in the word of the great King. There needs no more to deliver
you, to deliver his people anywhere, how deep soever plunged, but only
the command of him that sits on the throne. If the gospel, the interests
of Christ, in these parts of the world, and the dear concerns of our
souls, and the souls of posterity, were all as dry bones, in a more
forlorn, and hopeless condition than they are, he could make all live
with a word. He that is our King, that sits upon the throne, can command
life into that which seems as far from living as a dry bone. While he
keeps the throne, it is a senseless heart that fails through distrust of
his power, even when all visible power and help fail. - David Clarkson.

[Psa 44:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#005.md)

"Through thee will we push down our enemies": literally, "We will toss
them in the air with our horn;" a metaphor taken from an ox or bull
tossing the dogs into the air which attack him. - Adam Clarke.

[Psa 44:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#006.md)

"I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me." By "bow"
and "sword," he meaneth all manner of weapons and warlike instruments
whatsoever; and by "saving," he meaneth delivering from dangers,
speaking under the person of one (because all the faithful are but one
body), in the name of all the rest. - Thomas Wilcocks.

[Psa 44:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#006.md)

"I will not trust in my bow," etc. I will not trust in my own sword or
bow, but in the sword of the Divine Warrior, and in the bow of the
Divine Archer, whose arrows are sharp in the heart of his enemies, as
described in the next ([Psa 45:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#003).md),
which is connected by that imagery with this Psalm, as well as by its
inner meaning. - Christopher Wordsworth.

[Psa 44:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#006.md)

The less confidence we have in ourselves or in anything beside God, the
more evidence have we of the sincerity of our faith in God. - David
Dickson.

[Psa 44:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#006.md), [Psa
44:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#007.md)

The two verses correspond exactly to [Psa
44:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#003.md). As there, in reference to the
past, the salvation was ascribed wholly to God, so here in reference to
the future. - E. W. Hengstenberg.

[Psa 44:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#011.md)

"Like sheep appointed for meat." This very strongly and strikingly
intimates the extent of the persecution and slaughter to which they were
exposed; there being no creature in the world of which such vast numbers
are constantly slaughtered as of sheep for the subsistence of man. The
constancy of such slaughter is also mentioned in [Psa
44:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#022.md) as illustrating the continual
oppression to which the Hebrews were subject. - Kitto's Pictorial Bible.

[Psa 44:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#011.md)

"Like sheep appointed for meat," and not reserved for breeding or for
wool. - Arthur Jackson.

[Psa 44:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#012.md)

"Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy wealth by
their price." The sense is: Thou hast given thy people unto the power of
their enemies without trouble, without causing the victory even to be
dearly bought, as one who parts with a good for any price, which he
despises and hates, desiring merely to get rid of it. - E. W.
Hengstenberg.

[Psa 44:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#012.md)

"Thou sellest thy people for nought," etc. Referring to the siege of
Jerusalem by Titus, Eusebius says: "Many were sold for a small price;
there were many to be sold, but few to buy."

[Psa 44:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#012.md)

"And dost not increase thy wealth by their price." Thou hast not
advanced thy honour and service thereby; for thy enemies do not serve
thee more and better than thy people, nor yet so much. - Matthew Pool.

[Psa 44:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#012) (last clause.md)

Takest no money for them; literally, enhancest not the price of them, as
a seller usually does to the buyer. - Daniel Cresswell.

[Psa 44:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#014.md)

"Thou makest us a byword;" literally, for a similitude, משׁל stands
here, as in the original passage ([Deu
28:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#037).md), in the common signification,
similitude. The misery of Israel is so great, that people would
figuratively call a miserable man a Jew, just as liars were called
Cretans; wretched slaves, Sardians. So far are the people from being now
"blessed of the Lord" in whom according to the promise, all the heathen
are to be blessed. - E. W. Hengstenberg.

[Psa 44:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#015.md)

"My confusion is continually before me." When the visible church is
visited with sad calamities, the true members thereof are partakers of
the trouble, and sorrow, and shame of that condition. - David Dickson.

[Psa 44:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#017.md)

Eusebius, narrating the cruelties inflicted upon the Christians by the
Eastern tyrant, Maximinus, says: "He prevailed against all sorts of
people, the Christians only excepted, who contemned death and despised
his tyranny. The men endured burning, beheading, crucifying, ravenous
devouring of beasts, drowning in the sea, maiming and broiling of the
members, goring and digging out of the eyes, mangling of the whole body;
moreover, famine and imprisonment; to be short, they suffered every kind
of torment for the service of God rather than they would leave the
worship of God, and embrace the adoration of idols. Women also, not
inferior to men through the power of the word of God, put on a manly
courage, whereof some suffered the torments with men, some attained unto
the like masteries of virtue." - From "The Ecclesiastical History of
Eusebius Pamphilus."

[Psa 44:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#017.md)

"Yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy
covenant." Although we cannot excuse ourselves from many other sins for
which thou hast justly punished us, yet this we must say for ourselves,
that through thy grace we have kept ourselves from apostasy and
idolatry, notwithstanding all the examples and provocations, rewards
proposed and promised, or punishments threatened to induce us thereunto;
which we hope thou wilt graciously consider, and not suffer us to be
tempted above what we are able to bear. - Matthew Pool.

[Psa 44:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#017.md)

If any of you would abide by Jesus Christ in this storm, try how ye have
covenanted with him, and how ye have closed the bargain with him, and
upon what terms. But I trow there are many of you in this age that are
like young wanton folk, that run fast together and marry, but never take
any account how they will keep house, but presently go to poverty and
beggary. I trow it falls out so with many of you that are professors in
this generation. Ye take up your religion, and ye wot not how, and ye
cannot give an account how ye came by it. I will tell you, sirs; ye will
abide no longer by Christ than till a storm blow, and then ye will quit
him and deny his cause. Ye have need to take heed to this, for it will
ruin your souls in the end of the day. But I shall tell you, sirs, the
right way of covenanting with God. It is when Christ and the believer
meet. Our Lord gives him his laws, statutes, and commands, and he
charges him not to quit a hoof of them. No; though he should be torn
into a thousand pieces; and the right covenanter says, Amen. - Alexander
Peden's Sermon, 1682.

[Psa 44:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#017.md)

Neither the persecuting hand of men, nor the chastising hand of God,
relaxed ancient singular saints. Believers resemble the moon, which
emerges from her eclipse by keeping her motion, and ceases not to shine
because the dogs bark at her. Shall we cease to be professors because
others will not cease to be persecutors? - William Seeker.

[Psa 44:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#017.md)

The church having reported her great troubles, speaks it as an argument
of much sincerity towards God, and strength of grace received from him:
"All this has come upon us" (that is, all these common calamities and
afflictions), "yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt
falsely in thy covenant. Our heart is not turned back, neither have our
steps declined from thy way;" as if she had said, These afflictions have
been strong temptations upon us to cause us to decline from thy ways,
but through grace we have kept our ground and remained constant in thy
covenant, yea, "though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons,
and covered us with the shadow of death." As many, yea, most of the
saints have improved under the cross, so there have been some, who
either through their present unbelief, or forgetfulness of "the
exhortation which" (as the apostle saith, [Heb
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#005).md), "speaketh unto them as unto
children," have had their faintings or declinings under it. - Joseph
Caryl.

[Psa 44:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#018.md)

"Our heart is not turned back." Serious piety has become a ludicrous
subject with which the wanton wits of this atheistical world sport
themselves; but behold the wisdom and goodness of God, exhibiting to the
world undeniable testimonies of the truth of religion as often as the
sincere professors thereof are brought to the test by afflictions from
the hand of God, or persecutions from the hands of men. Lo! "here is the
faith and patience of the saints;" here is their courage, meekness, and
self-denial, shining as gold in the fire. They have the real proofs of
it before their eyes. Instead of casting them into hell, and convincing
them by eternal fire, he is pleased to cast his own people into the fire
of affliction, that they who scoff at them may be convinced at an easier
and cheaper rate. It is no new thing to see the enemies of religion
brought over to embrace it by the constancy and faithfulness of the
saints in their trials and sufferings for it. God grant that the atheism
of this present generation do not occasion a more fiery trial to the
people of God in it than they have yet suffered. - John Flavel.

[Psa 44:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#018.md)

"Our heart." The word לבב or Greek καρδία, that is rendered "heart,"
both in the Old and New Testament, doth signify the understanding, the
mind, will, affections, conscience, the whole soul. "Our heart is not
turned back." Our understandings and minds are the same as they were in
a summer's day, though now we be in a winter's storm; though now we be
afflicted, tossed, broken, and persecuted, yet notwithstanding, "our
heart is not turned back," our mind, will, affections, and conscience,
our whole soul, is the same now as before. - Thomas Brooks.

[Psa 44:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#019.md)

"Though thou hast sore broken us in place of dragons," etc. Where men,
comparable to dragons for their poison and cruelty, dwell particularly
in Rome, and the Roman jurisdiction, both Pagan and Papal, the seat of
Satan, the great red dragon, and' of his wretched brood and offspring,
the beast, to whom he has given his power; where the saints and
followers of Christ have been sorely afflicted and persecuted, and yet
have held fast the name of Christ, and not denied his faith. See [Rev
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#013.md), and [Rev
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#003.md). The wilderness is the habitation
of dragons; and this is the name of the place where the church is said
to be in the times of the Papacy, and where she is fed and preserved for
a time, and times, and half-a-time. [Rev
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#006.md), [Rev
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#014.md). "And covered us with the shadow
of death." As the former phrase devotes the cruelty of the enemies of
Christ's church and people, this their dismal afflictions and forlorn
state and condition; and may have some respect to the darkness of
Popery, when it was at the height, and the church of Christ was covered
with it, there being very little appearances and breakings forth of
gospel light anywhere. - John Gill.

[Psa 44:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#019.md)

"Dragons." The word rendered dragons - תּגּים, tannim - means either a
great fish, a sea monster, a serpent, a dragon, or a crocodile. It may
also mean a jackal, a fox, or a wolf. De Wette renders it here jackals.
The idea in the passage is essentially the same, whichever
interpretation of the word is adopted. The "place of dragons" would
denote the place where such monsters are found, or where they had their
abode: that is to say, in desolate places, wastes, deserts, old ruins,
depopulated towns. - Albert Barnes.

[Psa 44:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#020.md)

"Stretched out our hands to a strange god." The stretching out the hand
towards an object of devotion, or an holy place, was an ancient usage
among the Jews and heathens both, and it continues in the East to this
time, which continuance I do not remember to have seen remarked. That
this attitude in prayer has continued among the Eastern people, appears
by the following passage from Pitts, in his account of the religion and
manners of the Mohammedans. Speaking of the Algerines throwing wax
candles and pots of oil overboard, as a present to some marabbot (or
Mohammedan saint), Pitts goes on, and says, "When this is done, they all
together hold up their hands, begging the marabbot's blessing, and a
prosperous voyage." In the same page he tells us, "the marabbots have
generally a little neat room built over their graves, resembling in
figure their mosques or churches, which is very nicely cleaned, and well
looked after." And in the succeeding page he tells us, "Many people
there are who will scarce pass by any of them without lifting up their
hand, and saying some short prayer." In like manner, he tells us, that
at quitting the Beat, or holy house at Mecca, to which they make devout
pilgrimages, "they hold up their hands towards the Beat, making earnest
petitions." - Harmer' s "Observations."

[Psa 44:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#021.md)

"Shall not God search this out?" etc. Are there such variety of trials
appointed to examine the sincerity of men's graces? How great a vanity,
then, is hypocrisy! and to how little purpose do men endeavour to
conceal and hide it! We say, murder will out; and we may as confidently
affirm, hypocrisy will out. When Rebekah had laid the plot to disguise
her son Jacob, and by personating his brother, to get the blessing,
Jacob thus objects against it: "My father peradventure will feel me, and
I shall seem to him as a deceiver, and I shall bring a curse upon me and
not a blessing." And if he should say, But what if my father detect the
cheat? How, then, shall I look him in the face? How shall I escape a
curse? After the same manner every upright soul scares itself from the
way of hypocrisy. If I dissemble, and pretend to be what I am not, my
Father will find me out. There is no darkness nor shadow of death that
can conceal the hypocrite; but out it will come at last, let him use all
the art he can to hide it.....If men's works be not good, it is
impossible they should be hid long. A gilded piece of brass may pass
from hand to hand a little while, but the touchstone will discover the
base metal; and if that does not, the fire will. - John Flavel.

[Psa 44:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#021.md)

A godly man dares not sin secretly. He knows that God sees in secret. As
God cannot be deceived by our subtlety, so he cannot be excluded by our
secrecy. - Thomas Watson.

[Psa 44:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#021.md)

In time of persecution for religion, nothing can counterbalance the
terrors and allurements of the persecutors, and make a man steadfast in
the cause of God, save the fear of God, and love to God settled in the
heart; for the reason of the saints' steadfastness in this Psalm, is
because God would have searched out their sin if they had done
otherwise, "for he knoweth the secrets of the heart." - David Dickson.

[Psa 44:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#022.md)

"Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long," etc. Leonard
Schoener left, amongst other papers, the following admonition, to
comfort all who were suffering for Christ's name: -

"We pray thee, O eternal God, to bow down thy gracious ear. Lord of
Sabaoth, thou Lord of hosts, hear our complaint, for great affliction
and persecution have prevailed. Pride has entered thine inheritance, and
many supposed to be Christians, have united themselves therewith, and
have thus brought in the abomination of desolation. They waste and
destroy the Christian sanctuary. They have trodden the same under foot,
and the abomination of desolation is worshipped as God. They have
troubled thy holy city, thrown down thy holy altar, and slain her
servants when they could lay their hands upon them. And now that we as a
little flock are left, they have driven us into all thy lands with
contempt and reproach. We are scattered as sheep having no shepherd. We
have been compelled to forsake house and home. We are as night ravens
which abide in the rocks; our chambers are in holes and crags. They
watch for us as fowls that fly in the air. We wander in the woods, they
hunt us with dogs. They lead us away, seized and bound, as lambs that
open not their mouths. They cry out against us as seditious persons and
heretics. We are brought like sheep to the slaughter. Many sit
oppressed, and in bonds which even decay their bodies. Some have sunk
under their sufferings, and died without fault. Here is the patience of
the saints in the earth. We must be tried by suffering here. The
faithful have they hanged on trees, strangled, hewn in pieces, secretly
and openly drowned. Not only men, but likewise women and maidens have
borne witness to the truth, that Jesus Christ is the truth, the only way
to eternal life. The world still rages, and rests not; it raves as if
mad. They invent lies against us. They cease not their fires and
murders. They make the world too narrow for us. O Lord, how long wilt
thou be silent? How long wilt thou not judge the blood of thy saints?
Let it come up before thy throne. How precious in thine eye is the blood
of thy holy ones! Therefore have we comfort in all our need, a refuge in
thee alone, and in none besides; but neither comfort, nor rest, nor
peace on this earth. But he who hopeth in thee shall never be
confounded. O Lord, there is no sorrow so great that can separate us
from thee; therefore, without ceasing we call upon thee, through Christ
thy Son our Lord, whom thou of thy free grace hast given us for our
comfort. He hath prepared and made known to us the straight path, and
the way to eternal life. Everlasting glory and triumph, honour and
praise, be given unto thee, both now and to eternity, and let thy
righteousness remain for ever. Let all the people bless thy holy name,
through Christ the righteous Judge, who cometh to judge the whole world.
Amen." - From "A Martyrology of the Churches of Christ, commonly called
Baptists. Edited by E. B. Underhill." 1850.

[Psa 44:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#022.md)

"For thy sake are we killed." It is mercy to us, that when God might
punish us for our sins, he doth make our correction honourable, and our
troubles to be for a good cause - "For thy sake," etc. - David Dickson.

[Psa 44:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#022.md)

"For thy sake." This passage is cited by St. Paul, [Rom
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#036.md), apparently from the lxx, an
illustration of the fact that the church of God has in all ages been a
persecuted church. But there is this remarkable difference between the
tone of the Psalmist and the tone of the apostle: the former cannot
understand the chastening, and complains that God's heavy hand has been
laid without cause upon his people; the latter can rejoice in
persecutions also, and exclaim, "Nay, in all these things we are more
than conquerors, through him that loved us." - J. J. Stewart Perowne.

[Psa 44:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#022.md)

"Killed." The word here used is not from קטל, but from הרג, which means
to strangle: this is the rendering given in "Lange's Biblewerk."

[Psa 44:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#023.md)

"Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord?" and [Psa
121:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#004.md), "Behold, he that keepeth Israel
shall neither slumber nor sleep." If God at no time sleep, why doth the
church call on him so often to awake? If he must be awakened from sleep,
why doth the Psalmist say he never sleeps? Are not these places
contradictory?

answer: It is one thing what the afflicted church cries in the heat of
her sufferings, another thing what the Spirit of truth speaks for the
comfort of the saints. It is ordinary for the best of saints and
martyrs, during the storm, to go to God as Peter did to Christ at sea
(sleeping in the stern of the ship), with such importunity in prayer as
if the Lord were no more sensible of their agony than Jonah was of the
mariners' misery, ready to perish in the turbulent ocean, and they cried
out, What meanest thou, O sleeper? Arise! Saints are so familiar with
God in prayer, as if they were at his bedside.

The Soul's Application. - O thou never-slumbering Watchman of the house
of Israel, carest not thou that we perish? Awake, awake! put on
strength, gird thyself, O thou arm of God! I know thou art up, but what
am I the better except thou help me up? I know thou sleepest not as man
doth, but what advantage hath my soul by that, except thou show thyself,
that I way know thou art waking? Oh, it is I that am asleep! Thou
seemest to sleep only to awaken me. O that I could watch with thee one
hour, as thou bidd'st me; I should soon perceive then thy vigilancy over
me for ever. - William Streat in "The Dividing of the Hoof." 1654.

[Psa 44:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#023.md)

"Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord?" etc. The weakness of our faith is
open to the temptation of supposing that God regards not the situation
of his people in the world; and the Spirit, who knows our infirmities,
provides a petition suited to this trial, which expresses at the same
time an expectation that God will arise to claim his people as his own.
- W. Wilson.

[Psa 44:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#025.md)

"For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the
earth." We are as to body and soul, smitten and thrown down, glued as it
were to the ground, so that we cannot raise ourselves up. - E. W.
Hengstenberg.

[Psa 44:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#025.md)

"For our soul is bowed down to the dust," etc. The speech is
metaphorical, expressing the depth of their misery, or the greatness of
their sorrow and humiliation. 1. The depth of their misery, with the
allusion to the case of a man overcome in battle, or mortally wounded,
and tumbling in the dust, or to a man dead and laid in the earth; as,
"Thou hast brought me into the dust of death." [Psa
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#015.md). Sure we are, the expression
importeth the extremity of distress and danger, either as a man dead or
near death. 2. The greatness of their sorrow and humiliation; and so the
allusion is taken from a man prostrate and grovelling on the ground,
which was their posture of humbling themselves before the Lord, or when
any great calamity befell them. As when Herod Agrippa died, they put on
sackcloth and lay upon the earth weeping. - Thomas Manton.

[Psalms 44:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 44:1</span></span>

1 We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what
work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.

2 How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst
them, how thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.

3 For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither
did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the
light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them.

[Psa 44:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#001.md)

"We have heard with our ears, O God." Thy mighty acts have been the
subjects of common conversation; not alone in books have we read thy
famous deeds, but in the ordinary talk of the people we have heard of
them. Among the godly Israelites the biography of their nation was
preserved by oral tradition, with great diligence and accuracy. This
mode of preserving and transmitting history has its disadvantages, but
it certainly produces a more vivid impression on the mind than any
other; to hear with the ears affects us more sensitively than to read
with the eyes; we ought to note this, and seize every possible
opportunity of telling abroad the gospel of our Lord Jesus viva voce,
since this is the most telling mode of communication. The expression,
"heard with our ears," may denote the pleasure with which they listened,
the intensity of their interest, the personality of their hearing, and
the lively remembrance they had of the romantic and soul-stirring
narrative. Too many have ears but hear not; happy are they who, having
ears, have learned to hear.

"Our fathers have told us." They could not have had better informants.
Schoolmasters are well enough, but godly fathers are, both by the order
of nature and grace, the best instructors of their sons, nor can they
delegate the sacred duty. It is to be feared that many children of
professors could plead very little before God of what their fathers have
told them. When fathers are tongue-tied religiously with their
offspring, need they wonder if their children's hearts remain sin-tied?
Just as in all free nations men delight to gather around the hearth, and
tell the deeds of valour of their sires "in the brave days of old," so
the people of God under the old dispensation made their families
cheerful around the table, by rehearsing the wondrous doings of the Lord
their God. Religious conversation need not be dull, and indeed it could
not be if, as in this case, it dealt more with facts and less with
opinions. "What work thou didst in their days, in the times of old."
They began with what their own eyes had witnessed, and then passed on to
what were the traditions of their youth. Note that the main point of the
history transmitted from father to son was the work of God; this is the
core of history, and therefore no man can write history aright who is a
stranger to the Lord's work. It is delightful to see the footprints of
the Lord on the sea of changing events, to behold him riding on the
whirlwind of war, pestilence, and famine, and above all to see his
unchanging care for his chosen people. Those who are taught to see God
in history have learned a good lesson from their fathers, and no son of
believing parents should be left in ignorance of so holy an art. A
nation tutored as Israel was in a history so marvellous as their own,
always had an available argument in pleading with God for aid in
trouble, since he who never changes gives in every deed of grace a
pledge of mercy yet to come. The traditions of our past experience are
powerful pleas for present help.

[Psa 44:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#002.md)

"How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand." The destruction of
the Canaanites from the promised land is the work here brought to
remembrance. A people numerous, warlike, gigantic and courageous, firmly
established and strongly fortified, were driven out by a far feebler
nation because the Lord was against them in the fight. It is clear from
Scripture that God sent a plague (so that the land ate up the
inhabitants thereof) and also a visitation of hornets against the
Canaanites, and by other means dispirited them, so that the easy
victories of Joshua were but the results of God's having worked
beforehand against the idolatrous nation. "And plantedst them." The
tribes of Israel were planted in the places formerly occupied by the
heathen. Hivites and Jebusites were chased from their cities to make
room for Ephraim and Judah. The Great Wonderworker tore up by the roots
the oaks of Bashan, that he might plant instead thereof his own chosen
"vineyard of red wine." "How thou didst afflict the people." With
judgments and plagues the condemned nations were harassed, by fire and
sword they were hunted to the death, till they were all expelled, and
the enemies of Israel were banished far away. "And cast them out." This
most probably refers to Israel and should be read, "caused them to
increase." He who troubled his enemies smiled on his friends; he meted
out vengeance to the ungodly nations, but he reserved of his mercy for
the chosen tribes. How fair is mercy when she stands by the side of
justice! Bright beams the star of grace amid the night of wrath! It is a
solemn thought that the greatness of divine love has its counterpart in
the greatness of his indignation. The weight of mercy bestowed on Israel
is balanced by the tremendous vengeance which swept the thousands of
Amorites and Hittites down to hell with the edge of the sword. Hell is
as deep as heaven is high, and the flame of Tophet is as everlasting as
the blaze of the celestial glory. God's might, as shown in deeds both of
mercy and justice, should be called to mind in troublous times as a stay
to our fainting faith.

[Psa 44:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#003.md)

"For they got not the land in possession by their own sword." Behold how
the Lord alone was exalted in bringing his people to the land which
floweth with milk and honey! He, in his distinguishing grace, had put a
difference between Canaan and Israel, and therefore, by his own
effectual power, he wrought for his chosen and against their
adversaries. The tribes fought for their allotments, but their success
was wholly due to the Lord who wrought with them. The warriors of Israel
were not inactive, but their valour was secondary to that mysterious,
divine working by which Jericho's walls fell down, and the hearts of the
heathen failed them for fear. The efforts of all the men-at-arms were
employed, but as these would have been futile without divine succour,
all the honour is ascribed unto the Lord. The passage may be viewed as a
beautiful parable of the work of salvation; men are not saved without
prayer, repentance, etc., but none of these save a man, salvation is
altogether of the Lord. Canaan was not conquered without the armies of
Israel, but equally true is it that it was not conquered by them; the
Lord was the conqueror, and the people were but instruments in his
hands. "Neither did their own arm save them." They could not ascribe
their memorable victories to themselves; he who made sun and moon stand
still for them was worthy of all their praise. A negative is put both
upon their weapons and themselves as if to show us how ready men are to
ascribe success to second causes. "But thy right hand, and thine arm,
and the light of thy countenance." The divine hand actively fought for
them, the divine arm powerfully sustained them with more than human
energy, and the divine smile inspired them with dauntless courage. Who
could not win with such triple help, though earth, death, and hell
should rise in war against him? What mattered the tallness of the sons
of Anak, or the terror of their chariots of iron, they were as nothing
when Jehovah arose for the avenging of Israel.

"Because thou hadst a favour unto them." Here is the fountain from
whence every stream of mercy flows. The Lord's delight in his people,
his peculiar affection, his distinguishing regard - this is the
mainspring which moves every wheel of a gracious providence. Israel was
a chosen nation, hence their victories and the scattering of their foes;
believers are an elect people, hence their spiritual blessings and
conquests. There was nothing in the people themselves to secure them
success, the Lord's favour alone did it, and it is ever so in our case,
our hope of final glory must not rest on anything in ourselves, but on
the free and sovereign favour of the Lord of Hosts.

[Psalms 44:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 44:4</span></span>

4 Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.

5 Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we
tread them under that rise up against us.

6 For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.

7 But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame
that hated us.

8 In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever. Selah.

[Psa 44:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#004.md)

"Thou art my King, O God." Knowing right well thy power and grace my
heart is glad to own thee for her sovereign prince. Who among the mighty
are so illustrious as thou art? To whom, then, should I yield my homage
or turn for aid? God of my fathers in the olden time, thou art my soul's
monarch and liege Lord. "Command deliverances for Jacob." To whom should
a people look but to their king? He it is who, by virtue of his office,
fights their battles for them. In the case of our King, how easy it is
for him to scatter all our foes! O Lord, the King of kings, with what
ease canst thou rescue thy people; a word of thine can do it, give but
the command and thy persecuted people shall be free. Jacob's long life
was crowded with trials and deliverances, and his descendants are here
called by his name, as if to typify the similarity of their experience
to that of their great forefather. He who would win the blessings of
Israel must share the sorrows of Jacob. This verse contains a personal
declaration and an intercessory prayer; those can pray best who make
most sure of their personal interest in God, and those who have the
fullest assurance that the Lord is their God should be the foremost to
plead for the rest of the tried family of the faithful.

[Psa 44:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#005.md)

"Through thee will we push down our enemies." The fight was very close,
bows were of no avail, and swords failed to be of service, it came to
daggers drawing, and hand to hand wrestling, pushing and tugging.
Jacob's God was renewing in the seed of Jacob their father's wrestling.
And how fared it with faith then? Could she stand foot to foot with her
foe and hold her own? Yea, verily, she came forth victorious from the
encounter, for she is great at a close push, and overthrows all her
adversaries, the Lord being her helper.

"Through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us." The
Lord's name served instead of weapons, and enabled those who used it to
leap on their foes and crush them with jubilant valour. In union and
communion with God, saints work wonders; if God be for us, who can be
against us? Mark well that all the conquests of these believers are said
to be "through thee," "through thy name:" never let us forget this, lest
going a warfare at our own charges, we fail most ignominiously. Let us
not, however, fall into the equally dangerous sin of distrust, for the
Lord can make the weakest of us equal to any emergency. Though today we
are timid and defenceless as sheep, he can by his power make us strong
as the firstling of his bullock, and cause us to push as with the horns
of unicorns, until those who rose up against us shall be so crushed and
battered as never to rise again. Those who of themselves can scarcely
keep their feet, but like little babes totter and fall, are by divine
assistance made to overthrow their foes, and set their feet upon their
necks. Read Christian's fight with Apollyon, and see how

"The man so bravely played the man

He made the fiend to fly."

[Psa 44:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#006.md)

"For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me." Thy
people Israel, under thy guidance, shouldered out the heathen, and
gained their land, not by skill of weapons or prowess of arms, but by
thy power alone; therefore will we renounce for ever all reliance upon
outward confidences, of which other men make such boast, and we will
cast ourselves upon the omnipotence of our God. Bows having been newly
introduced by king Saul, were regarded as very formidable weapons in the
early history of Israel, but they are here laid aside together with the
all-conquering sword, in order that there may be room for faith in the
living God. This verse, in the first person singular, may serve as the
confession of faith of every believer renouncing his own righteousness
and strength, and looking alone to the Lord Jesus. O for grace to stand
to this self-renunciation, for, alas! our proud nature is all too apt to
fix its trust on the puffed-up and supposititious power of the creature.
Arm of flesh, how dare I trust thee? How dare I bring upon myself the
curse of those who rely upon a man?

[Psa 44:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#007.md)

"But thou hast saved us from our enemies." In ages past all our rescues
have been due to thee, O God. Never hast thou failed us. Out of every
danger thou hast brought us. "And hast put them to shame that hated us."
With the back of thy saving hand thou hast given them a cuff which has
made them hide their faces; thou hast defeated them in such a manner as
to make them ashamed of themselves to be overthrown by such puny
adversaries as they thought the Israelites to be. The double action of
God in blessing his people and confounding his enemies is evermore to be
observed; Pharaoh is drowned, while Israel passes through the sea;
Amalek is smitten, while the tribes rejoice; the heathen are chased from
their abodes while the sons of Jacob rest beneath their vine and fig
tree.

[Psa 44:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#008.md)

"In God we boast all the day long." We have abundant reason for doing so
while we recount his mighty acts. What blessed boasting is this! it is
the only sort of boasting that is bearable. All other manna bred worms
and stank except that which was laid up before the Lord, and all other
boasting is loathsome save this glorying in the Lord, which is laudable
and pleasing. "And praise thy name for ever." Praise should be
perpetual. If there were no new acts of love, yet ought the Lord to be
praised for what he has done for his people. High let the song be lifted
up as we bring to remembrance the eternal love which chose us,
predestinated us to be sons, redeemed us with a price, and then enriched
us with all the fulness of God.

"Selah." - A pause comes in fitly here, when we are about to descend
from the highest to the lowest key. No longer are we to hear Miriam's
timbrel, but rather Rachel's weeping.

[Psalms 44:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 44:9</span></span>

9 But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with
our armies.

10 Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us
spoil for themselves.

11 Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and has scattered
us among the heathen.

12 Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy wealth
by their price.

13 Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision
to them that are round about us.

14 Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head
among the people.

15 My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my face hath
covered me,

16 For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of
the enemy and avenger.

[Psa 44:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#009.md)

"But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame." Here the patriot bard
begins to contrast the past glories of the nation's history with its
present sadness and distress; which he does not ascribe to the death of
some human champion, or to the accidents of war, but solely and alone to
the withdrawal of Israel's God. It seemed to the mourner that Jehovah
had grown weary of his people and put them away in abhorrence, as men
lay aside leprous garments, loathing the sight of them. To show his
displeasures he had made his people to be ridiculed by the heathen,
whose easy victories over their largest armies covered Israel with
disgrace. Alas! for a church and people when the Lord in the active
energy of his Spirit withdraws from them, they want no greater shame or
sorrow. He will not cast away his people finally and totally, but many a
church has been left to defeat and disgrace on account of sin, and
therefore all churches should be exceedingly watchful lest the like
should happen to themselves. Poverty and distress bring no shame on a
people, but the Lord's absence takes from a church everything which can
exalt and ennoble. "And goest not forth with our armies." If the Lord be
not the leader, of what avail are strong battalions? Vain are the
combined efforts of the most zealous workers if God's arm be not
revealed. May none of us in our churches have to mourn over the
ministry, the Sabbath school, the missionary work, the visiting, the
street preaching, left to be carried out without the divine aid. If our
great ally will not go with us our defeat is inevitable.

[Psa 44:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#010.md)

"Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy." The humiliating
consciousness that the Lord has left them soon makes men cowards. Flight
closes the fight of those who have not the Lord in the van. "And they
which hate us spoil for themselves." After defeat and retreat, comes
spoliation. The poor, vanquished nation paid a terrible penalty for
being overcome; plunder and murder desolated the conquered land, and the
invaders loaded themselves with every precious thing which they could
carry away. In spiritual experience we know what it is to be despoiled
by our enemies; doubts and fears rob us of our comforts, and terrible
forebodings spoil us of our hopes; and all because the Lord, for wise
purposes, sees fit to leave us to ourselves. Alas! for the deserted
soul; no calamity can equal the sorrow of being left of God, though it
be but for a small moment.

[Psa 44:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#011.md)

"Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat." As sheep are
slaughtered for food, so were the people slain in flocks, with ease, and
frequency. Not with the dignity of sacrifice, but with the cruelty of
the shambles, were they put to death. God appeared to give them up like
sheep allotted to the butcher, to abandon them as the hireling abandons
the flock to wolves. The plaint is bitterly eloquent. "And hast
scattered us among the heathen." Many were carried into captivity, far
off from the public worship of the temple of God, to pine as exiles
among idolaters. All this is ascribed to the Lord as being allowed by
him, and even appointed by his decree. It is well to trace the hand of
God in our sorrows, for it is surely there.

[Psa 44:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#012.md)

"Thou sellest thy people for nought." As men sell merchandise to any one
who cares to have it, so the Lord seemed to hand over his people to any
nation who might choose to make war upon them. Meanwhile no good result
was perceptible from all the miseries of Israel; so far as the Psalmist
could discover, the Lord's name received no honour from the sorrows of
his people; they were given away to their foes as if they were so little
valued as not to be worth the ordinary price of slaves, and the Lord did
not care to gain by them so long as they did but suffer. The woe
expressed in this line is as vinegar mingled with gall: the expression
is worthy of the weeping prophet. "And dost not increase thy wealth by
their price." If Jehovah had been glorified by all this wretchedness it
could have been borne patiently, but it was the reverse; the Lord's name
had, through the nation's calamities, been despised by the insulting
heathen, who counted the overthrow of Israel to be the defeat of Jehovah
himself. It always lightens a believer's trouble when he can see that
God's great name will be honoured thereby, but it is a grievous
aggravation of misery when we appear to be tortured in vain. For our
comfort let us rest satisfied that in reality the Lord is glorified, and
when no revenue of glory is manifestly rendered to him, he none the less
accomplishes his own secret purposes, of which the grand result will be
revealed in due time. We do not suffer for nought, nor are our griefs
without result.

[Psa 44:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#013.md)

"Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours." Scorn is always an
intensely bitter ingredient in the cup of the oppressed. The taunts and
jeers of the victors pain the vanquished almost as much as their swords
and spears. It was a mystery indeed that God should suffer his royal
nation, his peculiar people, to be taunted by all who dwelt near them.
"A scorn and a derision to them that are round about us." The
down-trodden people had become a common jest; "as base as Israel," cried
the cruel tongue of the tyrant: so ordinary had the scorn become that
the neighbouring nations, though perhaps equally oppressed, borrowed the
language of the conquerors, and joined in the common mockery. To be a
derision to both strong and weak, superiors, equals, and inferiors, is
hard to bear. The tooth of scoffing bites to the bone. The Psalmist sets
forth the brutality of the enemy in many words, in order to move the
pity of the Lord, to whose just anger he traced all the sorrows of his
people; he used the very best of arguments, for the suffering of his
chosen touch the heart of God far more readily than any other
reasonings. Blessed be his name, our great Advocate above knows how to
avail himself of this powerful plea, and if we are at this hour enduring
reproach for truth's sake, he will urge it before the eternal throne;
and shall not God avenge his own elect? A father will not long endure to
see his children despitefully entreated; he may put up with it for a
little, but his love will speedily arouse his anger, and then it will
fare ill with the persecutor and reviler.

[Psa 44:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#014.md)

"Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among
the people." The lamentation is here repeated. They had sunk so low that
none did them reverence, but universally and publicly they were treated
as infamous and despicable. Those who reviled others dragged in Israel's
name by the way as a garnish to their insults, and if perchance they saw
one of the seed of Jacob in the street they used lewd gestures to annoy
him. Those whose heads were emptiest wagged them at the separated
people. They were the common butts of every fool's arrow. Such has been
the lot of the righteous in ages past, such is their portion in a
measure now, such may be yet again their heritage in the worst sense.
The world knows not its nobility, it has no eye for true excellence: it
found a cross for the Master, and cannot be expected to award crowns to
his disciples.

[Psa 44:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#015.md)

"My confusion is continually before me." The poet makes himself the
representative of his nation, and declares his own constant distress of
soul. He is a man of ill-blood who is unconcerned for the sorrows of the
church of which he is a member, or the nation of which he is a citizen;
the better the heart the greater its sympathy. "And the shame of my face
hath covered me." One constant blush, like a crimson mantle, covered him
both before God and man, he felt before God that the divine desertion
was well deserved, and before man, that he and his people were
despicable indeed now that heavenly help was gone. It is well for a
nation when there still exists in it men who lay to heart its sin and
shame. God will have pity on his chastened ones, and it is a pledge
thereof when he sends us choice ministers, men of tenderness, who make
the people's case their own.

[Psa 44:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#016.md)

"For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth." It seems that
from mocking the people of God, the adversaries advanced to reviling God
himself, they proceeded from persecution to the sin which is next of
kin, namely blasphemy. "By reason of the enemy and avenger." The enemy
boasted of avenging the defeats of their forefathers; they took revenge
for the ancient victories of Israel, by insulting over the now fallen
people. Here was a sad plight for a nation to be placed in, but it was
by no means a hopeless case, for the Lord who brought all this evil upon
them could with equal ease release them from it. So long as Israel
looked alone to her God, and not to her own arm, no foe could retain her
beneath his foot; she must arise, for God was on her side.

[Psalms 44:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 44:17</span></span>

17 All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither
have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.

18 Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from
thy way;

19 Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered
us with the shadow of death.

20 If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands
to a strange god;

21 Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the
heart.

22 Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as
sheep for the slaughter.

[Psa 44:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#017.md)

"All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee." Here the
Psalmist urges that Israel had not turned away from her allegiance to
Jehovah. When in the midst of many griefs we can still cling to God in
loving obedience, it must be well with us. True fidelity can endure
rough usage. Those who follow God for what they get, will leave him when
persecution is stirred up, but not so the sincere believer; he will not
forget his God, even though the worst come to the worst. "Neither have
we dealt falsely in thy covenant." No idol was set up, the ordained
worship was not relinquished, God was still nationally acknowledged, and
therefore the Psalmist is more earnest that the Lord should interpose.
This and the succeeding verses are suitable for the lips of martyrs,
indeed the entire Psalm might be called the martyr's complaint. Not for
sin but for righteousness did the saints suffer, not for falsehood but
for truth, not for forsaking the Lord but for following hard after him.
Sufferings of such a sort may be very terrible, but they are exceedingly
honourable, and the comforts of the Lord shall sustain those who are
accounted worthy to suffer for Christ's sake.

[Psa 44:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#018.md)

"Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy
way." Heart and life were agreed, and both were true to the Lord's way.
Neither within nor without had the godly sufferers offended; they were
not absolutely perfect, but they were sincerely free from all wilful
transgression. It was a healthy sign for the nation that her
prophet-poet could testify to her uprightness before God, both in heart
and act; far oftener the case would have worn quite another colour, for
the tribes were all too apt to set up other gods and forsake the rock of
their salvation.

[Psa 44:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#019.md)

"Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons." Though
utterly crushed and rendered desolate and driven as it were to associate
with creatures such as jackals, owls, serpents, which haunt deserted
ruins, yet Israel remained faithful. To be true to a smiting God, even
when the blows lay our joys in ruinous heaps, is to be such as the Lord
delighteth in. Better to be broken by God than from God. Better to be in
the place of dragons than of deceivers. "And covered us with the shadow
of death." The language is very strong. The nation is described as
completely enveloped in the dense darkness of despair and death, covered
up as though coffined in hopelessness. Yet the claim is made that they
still remained mindful of their God, and a glorious plea it is. Better
death than false of faith. Those who are true to God shall never find
him false to them.

[Psa 44:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#020.md)

An appeal is now made to the omniscience of God; he is himself called in
to bear witness that Israel had not set up another god. "If we have
forgotten the name of our God." This would be the first step in
apostasy; men first forget the true, and then adore the false. "Or
stretched out our hands to a strange god." Stretching out the hands was
the symbol of adoration or of entreaty in prayer; this they had not
offered to any of the idols of the heathen.

[Psa 44:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#021.md)

"Shall not God search this out?" Could such idolatry be concealed from
him? Would he not with holy indignation have detected unfaithfulness to
itself, even had it been hidden in the heart and unrevealed in the life?
"For he knoweth the secrets of the heart." He is acquainted with the
inner workings of the mind, and therefore this could not have escaped
him. Not the heart only which is secret, but the secrets of the heart,
which are secrets of the most secret thing, are as open to God as a book
to a reader. The reasoning is that the Lord himself knew the people to
be sincerely his followers, and therefore was not visiting them for sin;
hence, then, affliction evidently came from quite another cause.

[Psa 44:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#022.md)

"Yea," i.e., assuredly, certainly, "for thy sake," not for our offences,
but for obeying thee; the trials of these suppliants came upon them
because they were loyal to their God. "Are we killed all the day long."
Persecution never ceased to hound them to the death, they had no respite
and found no door of escape; and all in God's behalf, because they would
not forsake their covenant God and King. "We are counted as sheep for
the slaughter;" as if we were only meant to be killed, and made on
purpose to be victims; as if it were as easy and as innocent a thing to
slay us as to slaughter sheep. In this and following verses we clearly
hear the martyr's cry. From Piedmont and Smithfield, from St.
Bartholomew's massacre and the dragoonades of Claverhouse, this appeal
goes up to heaven, while the souls under the altar continue their solemn
cry for vengeance. Not long shall the church plead in this fashion, her
shame shall be recompensed, her triumph shall dawn.

[Psalms 44:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 44:23</span></span>

23 Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for ever.

24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our
oppression?

25 For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the
earth.

26 Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.

[Psa 44:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#023.md)

"Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord?" God sleepeth not, but the Psalmist
puts it so, as if on no other theory he could explain the divine
inaction. He would fain see the great Judge ending oppression and giving
peace to the holy, therefore does he cry "Awake;" he cannot understand
why the reign of tyranny and the oppression of virtue are permitted, and
therefore he enquires, "Why sleepest thou?" Arise. This is all thou
needest to do, one move of thine will save us. "Cast us not off for
ever." Long enough hast thou deserted us; the terrible effects of thine
absence are destroying us; end thou our calamities, and let thine anger
be appeased. In persecuting times men are apt to cry, Where is the God
of Israel? At the thought of what the saints have endured from their
haughty enemies, we join our voices in the great martyr cry, and sing
with the bard of Paradise: -

"Avenge, O Lord, thy slaughtered saints, whose bones

Lie scattered on the Alpine mountains cold;

Even those who kept thy truth so pure of old,

When all our fathers worshipped stocks and stones.

Forget not: in thy book record their groans

Who were thy sheep."

[Psa 44:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#024.md)

"Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our afflictions and our
oppression?" Not petulantly, but piteously and enquiringly, we may
question the Lord when his dealings are mysterious. We are permitted to
order our case with arguments, and plead the right before the face of
the august Majesty. Why, Lord, dost thou become oblivious of thy
children's woes? This question is far more easily asked than answered;
it is hard, indeed, in the midst of persecution to see the reason why we
are left to suffer so severely.

[Psa 44:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#025.md)

"For our soul is bowed down to the dust." Our heart is low as low can
be, as low as the dust beneath the soles of men's feet. When the heart
sinks, the man is down indeed. Heart-sorrow is the very heart of sorrow.
"Our belly cleaveth unto the earth." The man is prone upon the earth,
and he is not only down, but fastened down on the earth and glued to it.
It is misery, indeed, when the heart cannot escape from itself, is shut
up in its own dejection, and bound with the cords of despondency. God's
saints may be thus abject, they may be not only in the dust, but on the
dunghill with Job and Lazarus, but their day cometh, and their tide will
turn, and they shall have a brave summer after their bitter winter.

[Psa 44:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#026.md)

"Arise for our help." A short, but sweet and comprehensive prayer, much
to the point, clear, simple, urgent, as all prayers should be. "And
redeem us for thy mercies' sake." Here is the final plea. The favour is
redemption, the plea is mercy; and this, too, in the case of faithful
sufferers who had not forgotten their God. Mercy is always a safe plea,
and never will any man find a better.

"Were I a martyr at the stake.

I'd plead my Saviour's name,

Intreat a pardon for his sake.

And urge no other claim."

Here ends this memorable Psalm, but in heaven its power ends not, but
brings down deliverance for the tried people of God.
