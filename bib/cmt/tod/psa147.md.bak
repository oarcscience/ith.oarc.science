### [Psalms Chapter 147](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 147:0</span></span>

Subject. - This is a specially remarkable song. In it the greatness and
the condescending goodness of the Lord are celebrated. The God of Israel
is set forth in his peculiarity of glory as caring for the sorrowing,
the insignificant, and forgotten. The poet finds a singular joy in
extolling one who is so singularly gracious. It is a Psalm of the city
and of the field, of the first and the second creations, of the
commonwealth and of the church. It is good and pleasant throughout.

Division. - The song appears to divide itself into three portions. [Psa
147:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#001.md), Jehovah is extolled for
building up Zion, and blessing his mourners; [Psa
147:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#007.md), the like praise is given
because of his provision for the lowly, and his pleasure in them; and
then, [Psa 147:12-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#012.md), he is magnified
for his work on behalf of his people, and the power of his word in
nature and in grace. Let it be studied with joyful gratitude.

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Whole Psalm

The whole Psalm is an invitation unto praising of God. Arguments therein
are drawn,

I. from God's general goodness to the world ([Psa
147:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#004.md), [Psa
147:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#008.md), [Psa
147:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#009.md), [Psa
147:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#016).md):

II\. from his special mercy to his Church.

1\. In restoring it out of a sad and broken condition ([Psa
147:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#002.md), [Psa
147:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#003).md).

2\. In confirming it in a happy and prosperous estate, both temporal, in
regard of strength, peace, and plenty ([Psa
147:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#012).md); and spiritual, in regard
of his word, statutes, and judgments, made known unto them ([Psa
147:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#019.md), [Psa
147:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#020).md).

III\. these mercies are all commended by the manner of best wing them -
powerfully and swiftly. He doth it by a word of command, and by a word
of speed: "He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth
very swiftly" ([Psa 147:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#015).md).

The temporal part of this happy estate, together with the manner of
bestowing it, is herein described, but we must by no means exclude the
spiritual meaning. And what can be wanting to a nation which is
"strengthened" with walls, "blessed" with multitudes, hath "peace" in
the border, "plenty" in the field, and, what is alt in all, God in the
sanctuary, God the bar of the "gate," the Father of the children, the
crown of the "peace," the staff of the "plenty"? They have a "gate"
restored, a "city" blessed, a "border" quieted, a "field" crowned, a
"sanctuary" beautified with the oracles of God. What can be wanting to
such a people, but a mouth filled, a heart enlarged, a spirit exalted in
the praises of the Lord? "Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; praise thy God,
O Zion," etc. ([Psa 147:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#012).md). - Edward
Reynolds, in a Sermon entitled "Sion's Praises," 1657.

Whole Psalm

The God of Israel, what he has done, what he does, what he can do - this
is the "Hallelujah" note of his song. So gladsome is the theme, that in
[Psa 147:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#001.md) we find a contribution for
it levied on [Psa 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#001.md), [Psa
92:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#001.md), and [Psa
135:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#003.md); each must furnish its quota of
testimony to the desirableness of giving praise to such a God. - Andrew
A. Bonar.

[Psa 147:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#001.md)

"Praise ye the Lord." Alleluia. An expression in sound very similar to
this seems to have been used by many nations, who can hardly be supposed
to have borrowed it from the Jews. Is it impossible that this is one of
the most ancient expressions of devotion? From the Greeks using ἐλελεῦ
ἰὴ, as a solemn beginning and ending of their hymns to Apollo, it should
seem that they knew it; it is said to have been heard among the Indians
in America, and Alla, Alla, as the name of God, is used in great part of
the East: also in composition. What might be the primitive stock which
has furnished such spreading branches? - Augustine Calmet, 1672-1757.

[Psa 147:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#001.md)

"It is good to sing praises unto our God." Singing is necessarily
included and recognised in the praise of the Psalms. That the joyful
should sing is as natural as that the afflicted should pray - rather
more natural. Song as the expression of cheerfulness is something
universal in human nature; there were always, both in Israel and among
all other nations, songs of joy. Hence it is constantly mentioned in the
prophets, by whom joyous singing is used as a frequent figure, even as
they threaten that God will take away the song of the bridegroom and the
bride, and so forth. The singing of men is in itself good and noble. The
same God who furnished the birds of heaven with the notes wherein they
unconsciously praise their Creator, gave to man the power to sing. We
all know how highly Luther, for example, estimated the gift and the art
of song. Let him to whom it is granted rejoice therein; let him who
lacks it seek, if possible, to excite it; for it is a good gift of the
Creator. Let our children learn to sing in the schools, even as they
learn to read. Our fathers sang more in all the affairs of life than we
do; our tunes are in this respect less fresh, and artless, and joyous.
There are many among us who never sing, except when adding their voices
to the voice of the church, - and therefore they sing so badly there.
Not that a harsh song from a good heart is unacceptable to God; but he
should have our best. As David in his day took care that there should be
practised singers for the sanctuary, we should also make provision for
the church's service of song, that God may have in all respects a
perfect offering. How gracious and lovely is the congregation singing
with the heart acceptable songs! Rudolf Stier, in "The Epistle of James
Expounded," 1859.

[Psa 147:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#001.md)

The translation here is doubtful. It may either be rendered, "Praise the
Lord for he is good," or, "for it (praise) is good." Why is it declared
to be "pleasant" and "comely" to praise the Deity? Not only because if
we glorify him he will also glorify us, but because he is so infinitely
glorious that we are infinitely honoured simply in being reckoned worthy
to worship One so great. - John Lorinus.

[Psa 147:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#001.md)

"It is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is pleasant; and praise
is comely." These points are worthy of careful consideration.

I. To praise God is "good" for divers reasons.

1\. That is good which God commands ([Mic
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#008).md). So that thanksgiving is no
indifferent action, no will - worship, but it is cultus institutus, not
to be neglected.

2\. It raiseth the heart from earth to heaven; and being the work of
angels and saints in heaven, joins us with that choir above.

3\. It is good, again, because by it we pay, or at least acknowledge, a
debt, and this is common justice.

4\. Good, because for it we are like to receive a good and a great
reward; for if he that prays to God is like to be rewarded ([Mat
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#006).md), much more that man who sings
praises to him; for in prayer we consult with our own necessities, in
our praises we honour God, and bless him for his gifts.

II\. To praise God is "pleasant."

1\. Because it proceeds out of love; for nothing is more pleasant to him
that loves, than to make sonnets in the praise of that party he loves.

2\. Because it must needs please a man to perform that duty for which he
was created; for to that end God created men and angels, that they
should praise him.

3\. Because God is delighted with it, as the sweetest sacrifice ([Psa
1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001). 23.md).

4\. It is pleasant to God, because he is delighted with those virtues
which are in us, - faith, hope, charity, religion, devotion, humility,
etc., of all which our praises are a manifestation and exercise.

III\. To praise God is "comely"; for there is no greater stain than
ingratitude; it is made up of a lie and injustice. There is, then, all
the decency in the world in praise, and it is comely that a man be
thankful to his God, who freely gives him all things, - William
Nicholson.

[Psa 147:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#001.md)

David, to persuade all men to thankfulness, saith, "It is a good and
pleasant thing" to be thankful. If he had said no more but "good," all
which love goodness are bound to be thankful; but when he saith not only
"good," but "pleasant" too, all which love pleasure are bound to be
thankful; and therefore, as Peter's mother-in-law, so soon as Christ
healed her of a fever, rose up immediately to minister unto him ([Mat
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#015).md), so we, so soon as Christ hath
done anything for us, should rise up immediately to serve him. - Henry
Smith.

[Psa 147:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#001.md)

There is no heaven, either in this world, or the world to come, for
people who do not praise God. If you do not enter into the spirit and
worship of heaven, how should the spirit and joy of heaven enter into
you? Selfishness makes long prayers, but love makes short prayers, that
it may continue longer in praise. - John Pulsford, 1857.

[Psa 147:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#001.md)

"Praise." There is one other thing which is a serious embarrassment to
praising through the song-service of the Church, and that is, that we
have so few hymns of praise. You will be surprised to hear me say so;
but you will be more surprised if you take a real specimen of praising
and search for hymns of praise. You shall find any number of hymns that
talk about praise, and exhort you to praise. There is no lack of hymns
that say that God ought to be praised. But of hymns that praise, and say
nothing about it, there are very few indeed. And for what there are we
are almost wholly indebted to the old churches. Most of them came down
to us from the Latin and Greek Churches There is no place in human
literature where you can find such praise as there is in the Psalms of
David. - Henry Ward Beecher.

[Psa 147:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#002.md)

"The Lord doth build up Jerusalem," etc. If this Psalm were written on
occasion of the return from Babylon, and the rebuilding of the earthly
city, the ideas are to be transferred, as in other Psalms of the same
kind, to a more important restoration from a much worse captivity, and
to the building up of the church under the gospel, when Christ "gathered
together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad" ([Joh
11:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#052).md); that is, in the words of our
Psalm, he "gathered together the outcasts of Israel." So shall he again,
at the resurrection, "gather together his elect from the four winds"
([Mat 24:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#031).md), and "build up a
Jerusalem," in which they shall serve and praise him for ever. - George
Horne.

[Psa 147:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#002.md)

"The Lord doth build up Jerusalem," etc.

Jerusalem! Jerusalem! the blessing lingers yet

On the city of the chosen, where the Sabbath seal was set

And though her sons are scattered, and her daughters weep apart,

While desolation, like a pall, weighs down each faithful heart;

As the plain beside the waters, as the cedar on the hills,

She shall rise in strength and beauty when the Lord Jehovah wills:

He has promised her protection, and the holy pledge is good,

'Tis whispered through the olive groves, and murmured by the flood,

As in the Sabbath stillness the Jordan's flow is heard,

And by the Sabbath breezes the hoary trees are stirred.

Mrs. Hale, in "The Rhyme of Life."

[Psa 147:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#002.md)

"He gathereth together the outcasts of Israel." Wonder not that God
calls together "the outcasts," and singles them out from every corner
for a return; why can he not do this, as well as "tell the number of the
stars, and call them all by their names"? There are none of his people
so despicable in the eye of man, but they are known and regarded by God.
Though they are clouded in the world, yet they are the stars of the
world; and shall God number the inanimate stars in the heavens, and make
no account of his living stars on the earth? No; wherever they are
dispersed, he will not forget them: however they are afflicted, he will
not despise them. The stars are so numerous that they are innumerable by
man; some are visible and known by men, others lie more hid and
undiscovered in a confused light, as those in the milky way; a man
cannot see one of them distinctly. God knows all his people. As he can
do what is above the power of man to perform, so he understands what is
above the skill of man to discover. - Stephen Charhock.

[Psa 147:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#002.md)

"He gathereth together the outcasts of Israel." David might well have
written feelingly about the "outcasts," for he had himself been one; and
even from Jerusalem, in his age, when driven forth from thence by his
unnatural son, he went up by the ascent of Olivet, weeping and
barefooted, and other "outcasts" with him weeping also as they went. -
Barton Bouchier.

[Psa 147:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#003.md)

"He healeth the broken in heart," etc. Here are two things contained in
this text; the patients and the physician. The patients are the broken
in heart. The physician is Christ; it is he who bindeth up their wounds.

The patients here are felt and discerned to have two wounds or maladies;
brokenness of heart, and woundedness: he binds up such. Brokenness of
heart presupposeth a former wholeness of heart. Wholeness of heart is
twofold; either wholeness of heart in sin, or wholeness of heart from
sin. First, wholeness of heart from sin is when the heart is without
sin; and so the blessed angels have whole hearts, and so Adam and Eve,
and we in them, before the fall, had whole hearts. Secondly, wholeness
of heart in sin; so the devils have whole hearts, and all men since the
fall, from their conception till their conversion, have whole hearts;
and these are they that our Saviour intends, - "The whole need not the
physician, but they that are sick."

Brokenness of heart may be considered two ways; first, in relation to
wholeness of heart in sin: so brokenness of heart is not a malady, but
the commencement of the cure of a desperate disease. Secondly, in
relation to wholeness of heart from sin; and so it is a malady or
sickness, and yet peculiar to one blood alone, namely, God's elect; for
though the heart be made whole in its desire towards God, yet it is
broken for its sins. As a man that hath a barbed arrow shot into his
side, and the arrow is plucked out of the flesh, yet the wound is not
presently healed; so sin may be plucked out of the heart, but the scar
that was made with plucking it out is not yet cured. The wounds that are
yet under cure are the plagues and troubles of conscience, the sighs and
groans of a hungering soul after grace, the stinging poison that the
serpent's fang hath left behind it; these are the wounds.

Now the heart is broken three ways. First, by the law; as it breaks the
heart of a thief to hear the sentence of the law, that he must be hanged
for his robbery; so it breaks the heart of the soul, sensibly to
understand the sentence of the law, - Thou shalt not sin; if thou do,
thou shalt be damned. If ever the heart come to be sensible of this
sentence, - "Thou art a damned man," it is impossible to stand out under
it, but it must break. "Is not my word like a hammer, that breaketh the
rock in pieces?" ([Jer 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#029).md). Can any
rock-heart hold out and not be broken with the blows of it? Indeed, thus
far a man may be broken, and yet be a reprobate; for they shall all be
thus broken in hell, and therefore this breaking is not enough.

Secondly, by the Gospel; for if ever the heart come to be sensible of
the love of the Gospel, it will break all to shatters. "Rend your heart;
for the Lord is gracious," etc.: [Joe
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#013.md). When all the shakes of God's
mercy come, they all cry "Bend." Indeed, the heart cannot stand out
against them, if it once feel them. Beat thy soul upon the gospel: if
any way under heaven can break it, this is the way.

Thirdly, the heart is broken by the skill of the minister in the
handling of these two, the law and the gospel: God furnisheth him with
skill to press the law home, and gives him understanding how to put the
gospel, and by this means doth God break the heart: for, alas, though
the law be never so good a hammer, and although the gospel be never so
fit an anvil, yet if the minister lay not the soul upon it the heart
will not break: he must fetch a full stroke with the law, and he must
set the full power of the gospel at the back of the soul, or else the
heart will not break.

"He healeth the broken in heart." Hence observe, that Christ justifies
and sanctifies; for that is the meaning.

I. First, because God hath given Christ grace to practise for the sake
of the broken in heart; and therefore if this be his grace, to heal the
broken-hearted, certainly he will heal them. "The Spirit of the Lord is
upon me," etc. He hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted, etc.: [Luk
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018.md). If he be created master of this
art, even for this purpose, to heal the broken in heart, he will verily
heal them, and none but them. He is not like Hosander and Hippocrates,
whose father appointed them both to be physicians: he appointed his son
Hippocrates to be a physician of horses, yet he proved a physician for
men; he appointed Hosander to be a physician for men, and he proved a
physician for horses. Jesus is not like these; no, no; he will heal
those whom he was appointed to heal.

II\. Because Christ hath undertaken to do it. When a skilful physician
hath undertaken a cure, he will surely do it: indeed, sometimes a good
physician may fail, as Trajan's physician did, for he died under his
hands; on whose tomb this was written, "Here lies Trajan the emperor,
that may thank his physician that he died." But if Christ undertake it,
thou mayest be sure of it; for he tells thee that art broken in heart
that he hath undertaken it, he hath felt thy pulse already. [Isa
57:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#015.md). He doth not only undertake it,
but he saith he will go visit his sick patient, he will come to thy
bedside, yea, he will come and dwell with thee all the time of thy
sickness; thou shalt never want anything, but he will be ready to help
thee: thou needest not complain and say, "Oh, the physician is too far
off, he will not come at me." I dwell in the high places indeed, saith
God, but yet I will come and dwell with thee that art of an humble
spirit. Thou needest not fear, saying, "Will a man cure his enemies? I
have been an enemy to God's glory, and will he yet cure me?" Yea, saith
Christ, if thou be broken in heart I will bind thee up.

III\. Thirdly, because this is Christ's charge, and he will look to his
own calling, "The Lord hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted" ([Isa
61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001).md).... Neither needest thou fear
thine own poverty, because thou hast not a fee to give him; for thou
mayest come to him by way of begging; he will look to thee for nothing
for, "To him will I look that is poor," etc.: [Isa
66:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#002.md).

IV\. Fourthly, none but the broken in heart will take physic of Christ.
Now this is a physician's desire, that his patient would cast himself
upon him; if he will not, the physician hath no desire to meddle with
him. Now none but the broken in heart will take such physic as Christ
gives, and therefore he saith, "To him will I look that is of a broken
heart, and trembles at my words", [Isa
65:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#002.md). When I bid him take such a
purge, saith God, he trembles, and he takes it. - William Fenner, in a
Sermon entitled "The Sovereign Virtue of the Gospel," 1647.

[Psa 147:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#003.md)

O thou who dry'st the mourner's tear,

How dark this world would be,

If, when deceived and wounded here,

We could not fly to Thee!

The friends, who in our sunshine live,

When winter comes are flown'

And he who has but tears to give

Must weep those tears alone.

But Thou wilt heal that broken heart,

Which, like the plants that throw

Their fragrance from the wounded part,

Breathes sweetness out of woe.

When joy no longer soothes or cheers,

And e'en the hope that threw

A moment's sparkle o'er our tears

Is dimmed and vanished too;

Oh! who would bear life's stormy doom,

Did not thy wing of love

Come, brightly wafting through the gloom

Our peace-branch from above?

Then sorrow, touched by Thee, grows bright

With more than rapture's ray'

As darkness shows us worlds of light

We never saw by day!

Thomas Moore, 1779-1852.

[Psa 147:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#003.md)

"He healeth the broken in heart." The broken in heart is one whose heart
is affected with the evil of sin, and weeps bitter tears on account of
it; one who feels sorrow, shame, and anguish, on the review of his past
sinful life, and his base rebellion against a righteous God. Such a one
has a broken heart. His heart is broken at the sight of his own
ingratitude - the despite done by him to the strivings of the Holy
Spirit. His heart is broken when he considers the numberless invitations
made to him in the Scriptures, all of which he has wickedly slighted and
despised. His heart is broken at the recollection of a thousand kind
providences to him and to his family, by day and by night, all sent by
God, and intended for his moral, spiritual, and eternal benefit, but by
him basely and wantonly abused. His heart is broken at the consideration
of the love and compassion of the adorable Redeemer; the humiliation of
his birth; the devotedness of his life; the reproach, the indignity of
his sufferings; the ignominy and anguish of his death. His heart is
broken when his conscience assures him that all this humiliation, this
suffering, this death, was for him, who had so deliberately and
repeatedly refused the grace which the blood and righteousness of Christ
has purchased. It is the sight of Calvary that fills him with anguish of
spirit, that overwhelms him with confusion and self-abasement. While he
contemplates the amazing scene, he stands, he weeps, he prays, he smites
upon his breast, he exclaims, "God be merciful to me a sinner!" And
adds, "O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of
this death?"

The broken in heart must further be understood as one who seeks help
from God alone, and will not be comforted till he speaks peace to his
soul.

The act of God, in the scripture before us, is the moral and spiritual
health of man - of man, who had brought disease on himself - of man, by
his own rebellion against his Creator - of man, who had, in ten thousand
ways, provoked the justice of heaven, and deserved only indignation and
eternal wrath - the health of man, whom, in an instant, he could hurl to
utter destruction. The saving health here proposed is the removal of all
guilt, however contracted, and of all pollution, however rooted. It is
the communication of God's favour, the riches of his grace, the
implantation of his righteousness.

To effect the healing of the broken heart, God has, moreover, appointed
a Physician, whose skill is infallible, whose goodness and care are
equal to his skill. That Physician is none other than the Son of God. In
that character he has been made known to us. "They that be whole need
not a physician, but they that be sick." The prophet Isaiah introduces
his advent in the most sublime language: "He hath sent me to bind up the
broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the Opening of
the prison to them that are bound."

The health, the moral and spiritual soundness of the soul, my brethren,
is derived from the atoning sacrifice of Christ. The grace of God flows
to the broken in heart through his manhood, his godhead, his
righteousness, his truth; through his patience, his humility, his death
and passion; through his victory over sin, his resurrection, and
ascension into heaven. Here, thou broken in heart, thou sorrowing,
watching penitent; here is the medicine, here the Physician, here the
cure, here the health thou art seeking.

The healing of the broken in heart must be further understood as
effected through the agency of the Holy Spirit. It is done by the Spirit
of God, that it may be done, and that it may be well done; and that all
the praise, the glory of that which is done, may be ascribed to the
plenitude, the freeness, the sovereignty of his grace. The Spirit of
God, however, uses means. The means of grace are appointed expressly for
this purpose; the blessing of health is there applied. There, under the
sound of the everlasting gospel, while looking by faith to Christ, and
appropriating his merits, he healeth the broken in heart. There, while
commemorating the dying love of Christ, and applying its benefits by
faith to the soul, he healeth the broken in heart. There, while the
soul, sensible of his goodness, is offering up the song of praise, and
trusting alone in his mercy, he healeth the broken in heart. There,
while prostrate at his footstool, supplicating his grace, resting on his
finished redemption, he healeth the broken in heart. In the private acts
of devotion the Spirit of God also is near to bless and save. There,
while reading and believing his holy Word, while meditating on its
meaning; there, while in secret, solemn prayer, the soul takes hold on
God in Christ Jesus; he healeth the broken in heart. - Condensed from a
Sermon by Thomas Blackley, 1826.

[Psa 147:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#003.md)

"He healeth the broken in heart." I do indeed most sincerely sympathise
with you in this fresh sorrow. "Thy breaking waves pass over me." The
trial, so much the heavier that it is not the first breaking in, but the
waters continuing still, and continuing to rise, until deep calleth unto
deep at the noise of God's water-spouts, "Yea, and thy billows all." In
such circumstances we are greatly tempted to wonder if it be true, of
the Holy One in the midst of us, that a bruised reed he will not break,
that the smoking flax he will not quench. We may not, however, doubt it,
nor even in the day of our grief and our desperate sorrow, are we at
liberty to call it in question. Our God is the God of the broken heart.
The deeper such a heart is smitten, and the more it bleeds, the more
precious it is in his sight, the nearer he draws to it, the longer he
stays there. "I dwell with him who is of a contrite heart." The more
abundantly will he manifest the kindness and the glory of his power, in
tenderly carrying it in his bosom, and at last binding up its painful
wounds. "He healeth the broken in heart." "O thou afflicted, tossed with
tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will lay thy stones with fair
colours, and lay thy foundations with sapphires." Weeping Naomi said,
"Call me Mara, for the Lord hath dealt very bitterly with me."
Afterwards, happy Naomi took the child of her own Ruth, and laid it in
her bosom, and sweetly found that the days of her mourning were ended.

My dear friend, this new gash of deep sorrow was prepared for you by the
Ancient of Days. His Son - and that Son is love - watched over the
counsels of old, to keep and to perform them to the minutest
circumstance. - John Jameson, 1838.

[Psa 147:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#004.md)

"He telleth the number of the stars," etc. In which similitude he
showeth, that albeit Abraham could not comprehend the multitude of the
children, either of his faith or of his flesh, more than he could count
the number of the stars; yet the Lord knoweth every believer by name, as
he knoweth every star and can call everyone by its name. - David
Dickson.

[Psa 147:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#004.md)

"He telleth the number of the stars," etc. Among the heathen every
constellation represented some God. But the Scriptures show Jehovah, not
as one of many starry gods, but as the one God of all the stars. He is,
too, as he taught his people by Abraham, the God of a firmament of
nobler stars. His people are scattered and trodden as the sands of the
sea-shore. But he turns dust and dirt to stars of glory. He will make of
every saint a star, and Heaven is his people's sky, where broken-hearted
sufferers of earth are glorified into glittering galaxies. - Hermann
Venema.

[Psa 147:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#004.md)

"He calleth them all by their names." Literally, "calleth names to all
of them," an expression marking not only God's power in marshalling them
all as a host ([Isa 40:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#026).md), but also
the most intimate knowledge and watchful care, as that of a shepherd for
his flock. [Joh 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#003.md). - J. J. Stewart
Perowne.

[Psa 147:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#004.md)

"He calleth them all by their names." They render a due obedience to
him, as servants to their master. When he singles them out and calls
them by name to do some official service, he calls them out to their
several offices, as the general of an army appoints the station of every
regiment in a battalion; or, "he calls them by name," i.e. he imposeth
names upon them, a sign of dominion, the giving names to the inferior
creatures being the first act of Adam's derivative dominion over them.
These are under the sovereignty of God. The stars by their influences
fight against Sisera ([Jdg 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#020).md); and
the sun holds in its reins, and stands stone-still to light Joshua to a
complete victory: [Jos 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#012.md). They are
all marshalled in their ranks to receive his word of command, and fight
in close order, as being desirous to have a share in the ruin of the
enemies of their sovereign. - Stephen Charnock.

[Psa 147:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#004.md)

The immense distance at which the nearest stars are known to be placed,
proves that they are bodies of a prodigious size, not inferior to our
own sun, and that they shine, not by reflected rays, but by their own
native light. But bodies encircled with such refulgent splendour, would
be of little use in Jehovah's enpire, unless surrounding worlds were
cheered by their benign influence, and enlightened by their beams. Every
star is therefore concluded to be a sun surrounded by planetary globes.
Nearly a thousand of these luminaries may be seen in a clear winter's
night by the naked eye. But these do not form the eighty-thousandth part
of what may be descried by the help of telescopes. While Dr. Herschel
was exploring the most crowded part of the milky way, in one quarter of
an hour's time no less than 116,000 stars passed through the field of
view of his telescope. It has been computed, that nearly one hundred
millions of stars might be perceived by our most perfect instruments, if
all the regions of the sky were thoroughly explored. But immeasurable
regions of space lie beyond the utmost boundaries of human vision, even
thus assisted, into which imagination itself can scarcely penetrate, but
which are doubtless filled with operations of divine wisdom and divine
omnipotence. - Thomas Dick, in "The Christian Philosopher."

[Psa 147:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#005.md)

"His understanding is infinite." Hebrew: "Of his understanding there is
no number." God is incomprehensible. In place; in time; in
understanding; in lope. First, in place; because no place, no space, can
be imagined so great, but God exceeds it, and may be found beyond it.
Secondly, in time; because he exceeds all time: for he was before all
time that can be conceived, and shall be after all time. Time is a
created thing, to attend upon the creation and continuance of all things
created and continued by God. Thirdly, in understanding; because no
created understanding can comprehend him so that nothing of God may be
hid from it. Fourthly, in love; because God doth exceed all love: no
creature can love God according to his worth. All these ways of
incomprehensibleness follow upon his infiniteness. - Thomas Larkham in
"The Attributes of God Unfolded, and Applied," - 1656.

[Psa 147:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#005.md)

"His understanding is infinite." The Divine wisdom is said to be
"without number"; that is, the objects of which this wisdom of God can
take cognisance are innumerable. - Simon de Muis.

[Psa 147:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#005.md)

In this verse we have three of God's attributes, his greatness, his
power, and his knowledge; and though only the last of these be expressly
said to be infinite, yet is the same implied also of the two former; for
all the perfections of God being essential to him, must need be infinite
as he himself is; and therefore what is affirmed of one must, by a
parity of reason, be extended to the rest. - John Conant, 1608-1693.

[Psa 147:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#006.md)

"The Lord lifteth up the meek," etc. The meek need not envy the lofty
who sweep the earth with their gay robes, any more than real royalty is
jealous of the kingly hero who struts his hour upon the stage. They
shall be princes and rulers long after these actors have laid aside
their tinselled crowns.

How wonderful shall be the reversal when God shall place the last first
and the first last! Moralists have often pointed us to the ruler of a
hundred broad kingdoms lying down at last in six feet of imprisoning
clay; but God shall show us the wayside cottager lifted into the
inheritance of the universe. - Evangelical Magazine.

[Psa 147:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#007.md)

God creates, and then fails not to supply. Analogically, the Lord
buildeth Jerusalem, and provides for the wants of the inhabitants: by
spiritual inference, the saints argue that Christ establishes his church
and gives all the gracious gifts which are needed in that institution. -
John Lorinus.

[Psa 147:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#008.md), [Psa
147:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#009.md)

"Mountains ... ravens." Wonderful Providence which takes cognisance of
the mountainous and the minute alike. The All-Provider descends from
august and sublime heights to save the meanest creature from starvation
- extending constant care to the wants of even those abject little
objects, the young ravens, Heb. "the sons of the raven." - Martin Geier.

[Psa 147:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#008.md)

"Clouds ... rain ... grass." There is a mutual dependence and
subordination between all second causes. The creatures are serviceable
to one another by mutual ministries and supplies; the earth is cherished
by the heat of the heavens, moistened by the water, and by the
temperament of both made fruitful; and so sendeth forth innumerable
plants for the comfort and use of living creatures, and living creatures
are for the supply of man. It is wonderful to consider the subordination
of all causes, and the proportion they bear to one another. The heavens
work upon the elements, the elements upon the earth, and the earth
yieldeth fruits for the use of man. The prophet taketh notice of this
admirable gradation: "I will hear the heavens, and the heavens shall
hear the earth; and the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the
oil; and the corn, and the wine, and the oil, shall hear Jezreel" ([Hos
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#021.md), [Hos
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#022).md). We look to the fields for the
supplies of corn, wine, and oil; but they can do nothing without clouds,
and the clouds can do nothing without God. The creatures are beholden to
one another, and all to God. In the order of the world there is an
excellent chain of causes, by which all things hang together, that so
they may lead up the soul to the Lord. - Thomas Manton.

[Psa 147:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#008.md)

"Who prepareth rain?" The rain-cloud parts with its contents only when
God commands it, and as he commands, whether in the soft gentle shower
or In the drenching downpour that floods the fields and obstructs the
labours of the husbandman. - Thomas Robinson, in "Homiletical Commentary
on the Book of Job," 1876.

[Psa 147:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#008.md)

"Who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains." The wild grasses are
taken, as it were, under the special providence of God. In the perennial
verdure in regions above the zone of man's cultivation, we have a
perpetual proof of God's care of the lower animals that neither sow nor
reap. The mountain grasses grow spontaneously; they require no culture
but such as the rain and the sunshine of heaven supply. They obtain
their nourishment directly from the inorganic soil, and are independent
of organic materials. Nowhere is the grass so green and vigorous as on
the beautiful slopes of lawn-like pasture high up in the Alps, radiant
with the glory of wild flowers, and ever musical with the hum of
grasshoppers, and the tinkling of cattle-bells. Innumerable cows and
goats browse upon them; the peasants spend their summer months in making
cheese and hay from them for winter consumption in the valleys. This
exhausting system of husbandry has been carried on during untold
centuries; no one thinks of manuring the Alpine pastures; and yet no
deficiency has been observed in their fertility, though the soil is but
a thin covering spread over the naked rocks. It may be regarded as a
part of the same wise and gracious arrangement of Providence, that the
insects which devour the grasses on the Kuh and Schaf Alpen, the
pasturages of the cows and sheep, are kept in check by a predominance of
carnivorous insects. In all the mountain meadows it has been ascertained
that the species of carnivorous are at least four times as numerous as
the species of herb-eating insects. Thus, in the absence of birds, which
are rare in Switzerland, the pastures are preserved from a terrible
scourge. To one not aware of this check, it may seem surprising how the
verdure of the Alpine pastures should be so rich and luxuriant
considering the immense development of insect life. The grass, whenever
the sun shines, is literally covered with them - butterflies of gayest
hues, and beetles of brightest iridescence; and the air is filled with
their loud murmurs. I remember well the vivid feeling of God's gracious
providence, which possessed me when passing over the beautiful Wengern
Alp at the foot of the Jungfrau, and seeing, wherever I rested on the
green turf, alive with its tiny inhabitants, the balance of nature so
wonderfully preserved between the herb which is for man's food and the
moth before which he is crushed. Were the herbivorous insects allowed to
multiply to their full extent, in such favourable circumstances as the
warmth of the air and the verdure of the earth in Switzerland produce,
the rich pastures which now yield abundant food for upwards of a million
and a half of cattle would speedily become bare and leafless deserts.
Nor only in their power of growing without cultivation, but also in the
peculiarities of their structure, the mountain grasses proclaim the hand
of God. Many of them are viviparous. Instead of producing flowers and
seed, as the grasses in the tranquil valleys do, the young plants spring
from them perfectly formed. They cling round the stem and form a kind of
blossom. In this state they remain until the parent stalk withers and
falls prostrate on the ground, when they immediately strike root and
form independent grasses. This is a remarkable adaptation to
circumstances; for it is manifest that were seeds instead of living
plants developed in the ears of the mountain grasses, they would be
useless in the stormy regions where they grow. They would be blown away
far from the places they were intended to clothe, to spots foreign to
their nature and habits, and thus the species would speedily perish.

The more we think of it, the more we are struck with the wise foresight
which suggested the creative fiat, "Let the earth bring forth grass." It
is the most abundant and the most generally diffused of all vegetation.
It suits almost every soil and climate. - Hugh Macmillan, in "Bible
Teachings in Nature," 1868.

[Psa 147:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#008.md), [Psa
147:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#009.md)

The Hebrews had no notion of what we denominate "secondary laws," but
believed that God acted directly upon matter, and was the immediate,
efficient cause of the solemn order, and the varied and wonderful
phenomena of nature. Dispensing thus with the whole machinery of cause
and effect, as we employ those terms in philosophical language, their
minds were brought into immediate contact with God in his manifold
works, and this gave, both to devotion and the spirit of poetry, the
liveliest inspiration and the freest scope of action. Heaven and earth
were governed by his commands; the thunder was his "voice," the
lightning his "arrows." It is he who "causeth the vapour to ascend from
the ends of the earth." When the famished city should call upon the
corn, the wine, and the oil, and those should call upon the earth for
nourishment, and the parched earth should call upon the heavens for
moisture, and the heavens should call upon the Lord for permission to
refresh the earth, then Jehovah would hear and supply. He gave the rain,
and he sent the drought and famine. The clouds were not looked upon
merely as sustained by a law of specific gravity, but God spread them
out in the sky; these clouds were God's chariot, the curtains of his
pavilion, the dust of his feet. Snow and hail were fearful
manifestations of God, often sent as the messengers of his wrath. - F.
G. Hubbard, in "Bate's Encyclopaedia," 1865.

[Psa 147:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#008.md), [Psa
147:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#009.md)

God by his special providence prepares "food" for those who have no
other care taken for them. "Beasts" that live among men are by men taken
care of; they enrich the ground with manure, and till the ground; and
that brings forth corn for the use of these cattle as well as men. But
the wild beasts that live upon the mountains, and in woods and desert
places, are fed only from the heavens: the "rain" that from thence
distils enricheth those dry hills and "maketh grass to grow" there,
which else would not, and so God giveth to these wild beasts their food
after the same manner of Divine Providence as in the end of the verse he
is said to provide for the "young ravens." - Henry Hammond.

[Psa 147:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#009.md)

"The young ravens cry." The strange stories told by Jewish and Arabian
writers, on the raven's cruelty to its young, in driving them out of
their nests before they are quite able to provide for themselves, are
entirely without foundation, as no bird is more careful of its young
ones than the raven. To its habit of flying restlessly about in search
of food to satisfy its own appetite and that of its young ones, may
perhaps be traced the reason of its being selected by the sacred writers
as an especial object of God's protecting care. - W. Houghton, in "The
Bible Educator."

[Psa 147:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#009.md)

"The young ravens cry." While still unfledged the young ravens have a
strange habit of falling out of their nests, and flapping their wings
heavily to the ground. Next morning they are found by the shepherds
sitting croaking on the ground beneath their former homes, and are then
captured and taken away with comparative ease. - J. G. Wood, in "The
Illustrated Natural History," 1869.

[Psa 147:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#009.md)

"The young ravens cry." The evening proceedings and manoeuvres of the
rooks are curious and amusing in the autumn. Just before dusk they
return in long strings from the foraging of the day, and rendezvous by
thousands over Selbourne-down, where they wheel round in the air, and
sport and dive in a playful manner, all the while exerting their voices,
and making a loud cawing, which, being blended and softened by the
distance that we at the village are below them, becomes a confused noise
or chiding; or rather a pleasing murmur, very engaging to the
imagination, and not unlike the cry of a pack of hounds in hollow,
echoing woods, or the rushing of the wind in tall trees, or the tumbling
of the tide upon a pebbly shore. When this ceremony is over, with the
last gleam of day, they retire for the night to the deep beechen woods
of Tisted and Bopley. We remember a little girl, who, as she was going
to bed used to remark on such an occurrence, in the true spirit of
physico-theology, that the rooks were saying their prayers, and yet this
child was much too young to be aware that the Scriptures had said of the
Deity that "He feedeth the ravens that call upon him." - Gilbert White
(1720-1793), in "The Natural History of Selbourne."

[Psa 147:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#009.md)

Behold, and look away your low despair;

See the light tenants of the barren air:

To them, nor stores, nor granaries belong,

Nought but the woodlands and the pleasing song;

Yet, your kind heavenly Father bends his eye

On the least wing that flits along the sky.

To him they sing when Spring renews the plain;

To him they cry in Winter's pinching reign;

Nor is the music, nor their plaint, in vain.

He hears the gay, and the distressful call,

And with unsparing bounty fills them all.

Will he not care for you, ye faithless, say?

Is he unwise? Or, are ye less than they?

James Thomson, 1700-1748.

[Psa 147:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#009.md)

It is related of Edward Taylor, the sailor-preacher of Boston, that on
the Sunday before he was to sail for Europe, he was entreating the Lord
to care well for his church during his absence. All at once he stopped,
and ejaculated, "What have I done? Distrust the Providence of heaven! A
God that gives a whale a ton of herrings for a breakfast, will he not
care for my children?" and then went on, closing his prayer in a more
confiding manner. - From "Eccentric Preachers," by C. H. S.

[Psa 147:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#010.md)

The two clauses of this verse are probably intended to describe cavalry
and infantry, as forming the military strength of nations. It is not to
those who trust in such resources that Jehovah shows favour, but to

When a sinner is brought upon his knees, and becomes a suppliant, when
as he is laid low by affliction, so he lieth low in prayer and
supplication, then the Lord will be favourable to him, and show his
delight in him. "The Lord delighteth not in the strength of the horse;
he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man." No man is favoured by God
because of his outward favour, because he hath a beautiful face, or
strong, clean limbs; yea, not only hath the Lord no pleasure in any
man's legs, but not in any man's brains, how reaching soever, nor in any
man's wit how quick soever, nor in any man's judgment how deep soever,
nor in any man's tongue how eloquent or well spoken soever; but "The
Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his
mercy," in those that walk humbly with him, and call upon him ... All
the beauties and rarities both of persons and things are dull and flat,
yea, wearisome and loathsome to God, in comparison of a gracious,
honest, humble soul. Princes have their favourites ([Job
33:26](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#026).md): they are favourable to some
above many, either because they are beautiful and goodly persons, or
because they are men of excellent speech, prudence and deportment. All
godly men are God's favourites; he is favourable to them not only above
many men in the world, but above all the men of this world, who have
their portion in this life; and he therefore favours them, because they
are the purchase of his Son and the workmanship of his Spirit,
convincing them of, and humbling them for, their sins, as also creating
them after God in righteousness and true holiness. Such shall be his
favourites. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 147:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#011.md)

"Them that fear him, those that hope in his mercy." Patience and fear
are the fences of hope. There is a beautiful relation between hope and
fear. The two are linked in this verse. They are like the cork in a
fisherman's net, which keeps it from sinking, and the lead, which
prevents it from floating. Hope without fear is in danger of being too
sanguine; fear without hope would soon become desponding. - George
Seaton Bowes, in "In Prospect of Sunday," 1880.

[Psa 147:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#011.md)

"Them that fear him, those that hope in his mercy." A sincere Christian
is known by both these; a fear of God, or a constant obedience to his
commands, and an affiance, trust, and dependence upon his mercies. Oh,
how sweetly are both these coupled, a uniform, sincere obedience to him,
and an unshaken, constant reliance on his mercy and goodness! The whole
perfection of the Christian life is comprised in these two - believing
God and fearing him, trusting in his mercy and fearing his name; the one
maketh us careful in avoiding sin, the other diligent to follow after
righteousness; the one is a bridle from sin and temptations, the other a
spur to our duties. Fear is our curb, and hope our motive and
encouragement; the one respects our duty, the other our comfort; the one
allayeth the other. God is so to be feared, as also to be trusted; so to
be trusted, as also to be feared; and as we must not suffer our fear to
degenerate into legal bondage, but hope in his mercy, so our trust must
not degenerate into carnal sloth and wantonness, but so hope in his word
as to fear his name. Well, then, such as both believe in God and fear to
offend him are the only men who are acceptable to God and his people.
God will take pleasure in them, and they take pleasure in one another. -
Thomas Manton.

[Psa 147:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#011.md)

"Fear" and "Hope" are the great vincula of Old Testament theology,
bracketing and including in their meaning all its ideas. - Thomas Le
Blanc.

[Psa 147:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#011.md)

Fear and hope are passions of the mind so contrary the one to the other,
that with regard to the same object, it is strange they should meet in
the same laudable character; yet here we see they do so, and it is the
praise of the same persons, that they both fear God, and hope in him.
Whence we may gather this doctrine, That in every concern that lies upon
our hearts, we should still endeavour to keep the balance even between
hope and fear.

We know how much the health of the body depends upon a due temperament
of the humours, such as preserves any one from being predominant above
the rest; and how much the safety and peace of the nations result from a
due balance of trade and power, that no one grow too great for its
neighbours; and so necessary is it to the health and welfare of our
souls, that there be a due proportion maintained between their powers
and passions, and that the one may always be a check upon the other, to
keep it from running into extremes; as in these affections mentioned in
the text. A holy fear of God must be check upon our hope, to keep that
from swelling into presumption; and a pious hope in God must be a check
upon our fear, to keep that from sinking into despondency. This balance
must, I say, by a wise and steady hand, be kept even in every concern
that lies upon our hearts, and that we have thoughts about. I shall
enumerate those that are of the greatest importance. We must keep up
both hope and fear.

I. As to the concerns of our souls, and our spiritual and eternal state.

II\. As to our outward concerns, relating to the body and the life that
now is.

III\. As to the public concerns of the church of God, and our own land
and nation.

In reference to each of these, we must always study and strive to
support that affection, whether it be hope or fear, which the present
temper of our minds and circumstances of our case make necessary to
preserve us from an extreme. - Matthew Henry.

[Psa 147:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#012.md)

That all Creation must involuntarily praise the Lord, and that the
primary duty of conscious intelligence is the willing praise of the same
Deity, are the two axioms of the Psalmist's theology. He has in the
first part of this Psalm been stating the first, and now he is about to
announce the second. - Martin Geier.

[Psa 147:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#013.md)

"He hath strengthened the bars of thy gates." - Blessed is the city
whose gates God barreth up with his power, and openeth again with his
mercy. There is nothing can defend where his justice will strike; and
there is nothing can offend where his goodness will preserve. - Thomas
Adams.

[Psa 147:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#013.md), [Psa
147:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#014.md)

The Psalmist recites four arguments from which he would have Zion sing
praises. 1. Security and defence. 2. Benediction. 3. Peace. 4.
Sustenance or provision.

I. Security. Jerusalem is a city secure, being defended by God: "For he
hath strengthened the bars of thy gates." Gates and bars do well to a
city, but then only is the city secure when God makes them strong. The
true munition of a city is God's defence of it. Arms, laws, wealth,
etc., are the bars, but God must put strength into them.

II\. Benediction. Jerusalem is a happy city, for "he hath blessed thy
children within thee," thy kings, princes, magistrates, etc., with
wisdom, piety, etc.

III\. Peace. Jerusalem is a peaceable city. "He maketh peace in thy
borders," the very name intimates so much; for Jerusalem interpreted is
visio pacis - Vision of peace.

IV\. Abundance. Jerusalem is a city provided by God with necessary food
and provision; for "He filleth thee with the finest of the wheat." -
William Nicholson.

[Psa 147:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#014.md)

"He maketh peace in thy borders," etc. There is a political peace -
peace in city and country; this is the fairest flower of a Prince's
crown; peace is the best blessing of a nation. It is well with bees when
there is a noise; but it is best with Christians when, as in the
building of the Temple, there is no noise of hammer heard. Peace brings
plenty along with it; how many miles would some go on pilgrimage to
purchase this peace! Therefore the Greeks made Peace to be the nurse of
Pluto, the God of wealth. Political plants thrive best in the sunshine
of peace. "He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the
finest of the wheat." The ancients made the harp the emblem of peace:
how sweet would the sounding of this harp be after the roaring of the
cannon! All should study to promote this political peace. The godly man,
when he dies, "enters into peace" ([Isa
57:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#002).md); but while he lives, peace must
enter into him. - Thomas Watson.

[Psa 147:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#014.md)

"He maketh peace." The Hebrews observe that all the letters in the name
of God are literae quiescentes, letters of rest. God only is the centre
were the soul may find rest: God only can speak peace to the conscience.
- John Stoughton, - 1639.

[Psa 147:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#014.md)

"Finest of the wheat." If men give much it is in cheap and coarse
commodity. Quantity and quality are only possible with human production
in inverse ratio; but the Lord gives the most and best of all supplies
to his pensioners. How truly the believer under the gospel knows the
inner spirit of the meaning here! The Lord Jesus Christ says, "My peace
I give unto you." And when he sets us at rest and all is reconciliation
and peace, then he feeds us with himself - his body, the finest wheat,
and his blood, the richest wine. - Johannes Paulus Palanterius.

[Psa 147:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#015.md)

"His word runneth very swiftly." There is not a moment between the
shooting out of the arrow and the fastening of it in the mark; both are
done in the very same atom and point of time. Therefore we read in the
Scripture of the immediate effects of the word of Christ. Saith he to
the leprous man, "Be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was
cleansed": [Mat 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#003.md). And to the blind
man, "Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he
received his sight": [Mar 10:52](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#052.md). No
arrow makes so immediate an impression in the mark aimed at as the arrow
of Christ's word. No sooner doth Christ say to the soul, Be enlightened,
be quickened, be comforted, but the work is done. - Ralph Robinson.

[Psa 147:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#016.md)

"He giveth snow like wool." There are three things considerable in snow,
for which it is compared to wool. First, for the whiteness of it. Snow
is white as wool; snow is so exceeding white that the whiteness of a
soul cleansed by pardoning grace, in the blood of Christ, is likened
unto it ([Isa 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#018).md); and the latter
part of the same verse intimates that the whiteness of snow bears
resemblance to that of wool. The whiteness of snow is caused by the
abundance of air and spirits that are in that pellucid body, as the
naturalists speak. Any thing that is of a watery substance, being frozen
or much wrought upon by cold, appears more white; and hence it is that
all persons inhabiting cold climates or countries, are of a whiter
complexion than they who inhabit hot. Secondly, snow is like wool for
softness, 'tis pliable to the hand as a lock or fleece of wool. Thirdly,
snow is like wool (which may seem strange) with respect to the warmness
of it. Though snow be cold in itself, yet it is to the earth as wool, or
as a woollen cloth or blanket that keeps the body warm. Snow is not warm
formally, yet it is warm effectively and virtually; and therefore is it
compared to wool. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 147:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#016.md)

"Like wool." Namely, curled and tufted, and as white as the snow in
those countries. [Isa 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#018.md), [Rev
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#014.md). - John Diodati.

[Psa 147:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#016.md)

"Snow like wool." The ancients used to call snow εριωδες υδωρ, woolly
water (Eustathius, in Dionys. Perieget. p. 91). Martial gives it the
name of densum vellus aquarum, a thick fleece of waters (Epigram. 1. iv.
Ep. 3). Aristophanes calls clouds, flying fleeces of wool (Nubes, p.
146). Pliny calls it the froth of the celestial waters (Nat. His. lib.
17 cap. 2). - Samuel Burder.

[Psa 147:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#016.md)

"He giveth snow like wool." In Palestine snow is not the characteristic
feature of winter as it is in northern latitudes. It is merely an
occasional phenomenon. Showers of it fall now and then in severer
seasons on the loftier parts of the land, and whiten for a day or two
the vineyards and cornfields: but it melts from the green earth as
rapidly as its sister vapours vanish from the blue sky.... But the
Psalmist seized the occasional snow, as he seized the fleeting vapour,
and made it a text of his spiritual meditations. Let us follow his
example.

"He giveth snow like wool," says the Psalmist. This comparison expressly
indicates one of the most important purposes which the snow serves in
the economy of nature. It covers the earth like a blanket during that
period of winter sleep which is necessary to recruit its exhausted
energies, and prepare it for fresh efforts in the spring; and being,
like wool, a bad conductor, it conserves the latent heat of the soil,
and protects the dormant life of plant and animal hid under it from the
frosty rigour of the outside air. Winter-sown wheat, when defended by
this covering, whose under surface seldom falls much below 32 Fahr., can
thrive even though the temperature of the air above may be many degrees
below the freezing-point. Our country, enjoying an equable climate,
seldom requires this protection; but in northern climates, where the
winter is severe and prolonged, its beneficial effects are most marked.
The scanty vegetation which blooms with such sudden and marvellous
loveliness in the height of summer, in the Arctic regions and on
mountain summits, would perish utterly were it not for the protection of
the snow that lies on it for three quarters of a year.

But it is not only to Alpine plants and hybernating animals that God
gives snow like wool. The Esquimaux take advantage of its curious
protective property, and ingeniously build their winter huts of blocks
of hardened snow; thus, strangely enough, by a homeopathic law,
protecting themselves against cold by the effects of cold. The Arctic
navigator has been often indebted to walls of snow banked up around his
ship for the comparative comfort of his winter quarters, when the
temperature without has fallen so low that even chloric ether became
solid. And many a precious life has been saved by the timely shelter
which the snow-storm itself has provided against its own violence. But
while snow thus warms in cold regions, it also cools in warm regions. It
sends down from the white summits of equatorial mountains its cool
breath to revive and brace the drooping life of lands sweltering under a
tropic sun; and from its lofty, inexhaustible reservoirs it feeds
perennial rivers that water the plains when all the wells and streams
are white and silent in the baking heat. Without the perpetual snow of
mountain regions the earth would be reduced to a lifeless desert.

And not only does the Alpine snow thus keep always full rivers that
water the plains, but, by its grinding force as it presses down the
mountains, it removes particles from the rocks, which are carried off by
the rivers and spread over the plains. Such is the origin of a large
part of the level land of Europe. It has been formed out of the ruins of
the mountains by the action of snow. It was by the snow of far-off ages
that our valleys and lake-basins were scooped out, the form of our
landscapes sculptured and rounded, and the soil formed in which we grow
our harvests. Who would think of such a connection? And yet it is true
Iv Just as each season we owe the bloom and brightness of our summer
fields to the gloom and blight of winter, so do we owe the present
summer beauty of the world to the great secular winter of the glacial
period. And does not God bring about results as striking by agencies
apparently as contradictory in the human world? He who warms the tender
latent life of the flowers by the snow, and moulds the quiet beauty of
the summer landscape, by the desolating glacier, makes the cold of
adversity to cherish the life of the soul, and to round into spiritual
loveliness the harshness and roughness of a carnal, selfish nature. Many
a profitable Christian life owes its fairness and fruitfulness to causes
which wrecked and wasted it for a time. God giveth snow like wool; and
chill and blighting as is the touch of sorrow, it has a protective
influence which guards against greater evils; it sculptures the
spiritual landscape within into forms of beauty and grace, and deepens
and fertilises the soil of the heart, so that in it may grow from God's
own planting the peaceable fruits of righteousness.

And now let us look at the Giver of the snow. "He giveth snow like
wool." "The snow-flake," as Professor Tyndall strikingly says, "leads
back to the sun" - so intimately related are all things to each other in
this wonderful universe. It, leads further and higher still - even to
him who is our sun and shield, the light and heat of all creation. The
whole vast realm of winter, with its strange phenomena, is but the
breath of God - the Creative Word - as it were, congealed against the
blue transparency of space, like the marvellous frost-work on a
window-pane. The Psalmist had not the shadow of a doubt that God formed
and sent the annual miracle of snow, as he had formed and sent the daily
miracle of manna in the desert. It was a common-place thing; it was a
natural, ordinary occurrence; but it had the Divine sign upon it, and it
showed forth the glory and goodness of God as strikingly as the most
wonderful supernatural event in his nation's history. When God would
impress Job with a sense of his power, it was not to some of his
miraculous, but to some of his ordinary works that he appealed. And when
the Psalmist would praise God for the preservation of Israel and the
restoration of Jerusalem - as he does in: the Psalm from which my
subject is taken - it is not to the wonderful, miraculous events with
which the history of Israel abounded that he directs attention, but to
the common events of Providence and the ordinary appearances and
processes of nature. He cannot think enough of the Omnipotent Creator
and Ruler of the Universe entering into familiar relations with his
people, and condescending to their humblest wants. It is the same God
that "giveth snow like wool," who "shows his word unto Jacob, and his
statutes and commandments unto Israel." And the wonder of the
peculiarity is enhanced by thoughts borrowed from the wonders of nature.
We know a thousand times more of the nature, formation, and purpose of
the snow than the Psalmist did. But that knowledge is dearly earned if
our science destroys our faith. What amount or precision of scientific
knowledge can compensate us for the loss of the spiritual sensibility,
Which in all the wonders and beauties of the Creation brings us into
personal contact with an infinitely wise mind and an infinitely loving
heart? - Hugh Macmillan, in "Two Worlds are Ours," 1880.

[Psa 147:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#016.md)

"Snow." It is worth pausing to think what wonderful work is going on in
the atmosphere during the formation and descent of every snow shower;
what building power is brought into play I and how imperfect seem the
productions of human minds and hands when compared with those formed by
the blind forces of nature! But who ventures to call the forces of
nature blind? In reality, when we speak thus, we are describing our own
condition. The blindness is ours; and what we really ought to say, and
to confess, is that our powers are absolutely unable to comprehend
either the origin or the end of the operations of nature. - John
Tyndall, in "The Forms of Water," 1872.

The Lord takes the ice and frost and cold to be his; it is not only his
sun, but his ice, and his frost: "he scattereth his hoar frost like
ashes." The frost is compared to ashes in a threefold respect. First,
because the hoarfrost gives a little interruption to the sight. If you
scatter ashes into the air, it darkens the light, so doth the hoar
frost. Secondly, the hoary frost is like ashes because near in colour to
ashes. Thirdly, 'tis like; because there is a kind of burning in it:
frost burns the tender buds and blossoms, it nips them and dries them
up. The hoar frost hath its denomination in the Latin tongue from
burning, and it differs but very little from that word which is commonly
used in Latin for a coal of fire. The cold frost hath a kind of
scorching in it, as well as the hot sun. Unseasonable frosts in the
spring scorch the tender fruits, which bad effect of frost is usually
expressed by carbunculation or blasting. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 147:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#017.md)

"He casteth forth his ice like morsels." Or, shivers of bread. It is a
worthy saying of one from this text, - The ice is bread, the rain is
drink, the snow is wool, the frost a fire to the earth, causing it
inwardly to glow with heat; teaching us what to do for God's poor. -
John Trapp.

[Psa 147:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#017.md)

"He casteth forth his ice like morsels." The word here translated
"morsels," means, in most of the places where it occurs in the Bible,
pieces of bread, exactly the lxx. ψωμούς; for this very ice, this wintry
cold, is profitable to the earth, to fit it for bearing future harvests,
and thus it matures the morsels of bread which man will yet win from the
soil in due season. - Genebrardus, in Neale and Littledale.

[Psa 147:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#017.md)

"Morsels." Or, crumbs. [Gen 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#005.md); [Jdg

"It is extremely severe," said his sister to Archbishop Leighton one
day, speaking of the season. The good man only said in reply, "But thou,
O God, hast made summer and winter." - From J. N. Pearson's Life of
Archbishop Leighton, 1830.

[Psa 147:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#018.md)

"He sendeth out his word, and melteth them." Israel in the captivity had
been ice-bound, like ships of Arctic voyagers in the Polar Sea; but God
sent forth the vernal breeze of his love, and the water flowed, the ice
melted, and they were released. God turned their captivity, and, their
icy chains being melted by the solar beams of God's mercy, they flowed
in fresh and buoyant streams, like "rivers of the south," shining in the
sun. See [Psa 126:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#004.md).

So it was on the day of Pentecost. The winter of spiritual captivity was
thawed and dissolved by the soft breath of the Holy Ghost, and the earth
laughed and bloomed with spring-tide flowers of faith, love, and joy. -
Christopher Wordsworth.

[Psa 147:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#019.md)

Here we see God in compassion bending down, in order to communicate to
the deeply fallen son of man something of a blessed secret, of which
without his special enlightment, the eye would never have seen anything,
nor the ear ever have heard. - J. J. Van Oosterzee, on "The Image of
Christ."

If the publication of the law by the ministry of angels to the
Israelites were such a privilege that it is reckoned their peculiar
treasure - "He hath shewed hit statutes unto Israel; he hath not dealt
so with any nation" - what is the revelation of the gospel by the Son of
God himself? For although the law is obscured and defaced since the
fall, yet there are some ingrafted notions of it in human nature; but
there is not the least suspicion of the gospel. The law discovers our
misery, but the gospel alone shows the way to be delivered from it. If
an advantage so great and so precious doth not touch our hearts; and, in
possessing it with joy, if we are not sensible of the engagements the
Father of mercies hath laid upon us; we shall be the ungratefulest
wretches in the world. - William Bales.

That some should have more means of knowing the Creator, others less, it
is all from the mercy and will of God. His church hath a privilege and
an advantage above other nations in the world; the Jews had this favour
above the heathens, and Christians above the Jews; and no other reason
can be assigned but his eternal love. - Thomas Manton.

[Psa 147:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#020.md)

"He hath not dealt so with any nation.... Praise ye the Lord." The sweet
Psalmist of Israel, a man skilful in praises, doth begin and end this
Psalm with Hallelujah. In the body of the Psalm he doth set forth the
mercy of God, both towards all creatures in general in his common
providence, and towards his church in particular. So in this close of
the Psalm: "He sheweth his word unto Jacob, and his statutes to Israel.
He hath not dealt so with any nation." In the original 'tis, "He hath
not dealt so with every nation:" that is, with any nation. In the text
you may observe a position and a conclusion. A position; and that is,
that God deals in a singular way of mercy with his people above all
other people. And then the conclusion: "Praise ye the Lord." Doctrine.
That God deals in a singular way of mercy with his people, and therefore
expects singular praises from his people. - Joseph Alleine (1663-1668),
in "A Thanksgiving Sermon."

[Psa 147:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#020.md)

See the wonderful goodness of God, who besides the light of nature, has
committed to us the sacred Scriptures. The heathen are enveloped in
ignorance. "As for his judgments, they have not known them." They have
the oracles of the Sybils, but not the writings of Moses and the
apostles. How many live in the region of death, where the bright star of
Scripture has never appeared! We have the blessed Book of God to resolve
all our doubts, and to point out a way of life to us. "Lord, how is it
thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?" - [Joh
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#022.md). - Thomas Watson.

1 Praise ye the Lord, for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for
it is pleasant; and praise is comely.

2 The Lord doth build up Jerusalem, he gathereth together the outcasts
of Israel.

3 He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.

4 He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their

[Psa 147:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#001.md)

"Praise ye the Lord," or Hallelujah. The flow of the broad river of the
Book of Psalms ends in a cataract of praise. The present Psalm begins
and ends with Hallelujah. Jehovah and happy praise should ever be
associated in the mind of a believer. Jove was dreaded, but Jehovah Is
beloved. To one and all of the true seed of Israel the Psalmist acts as
choir-master, and cries, "Praise ye the Lord." Such an exhortation may
fitly be addressed to all those who owe anything to the favour of God;
and which of us does not? Pay him we cannot, but praise him we will, not
only now, but for ever. "For it is good to sing praises unto our God."
It is good because it is right; good because it is acceptable with God,
beneficial to ourselves, and stimulating to our fellows. The goodness of
an exercise is good argument with good men for its continual practice.
Singing the divine praises is the best possible use of speech, it speaks
of God, for God, and to God, and it does this in a joyful and reverent
manner. Singing in the heart is good, but singing with heart and voice
is better, for it allows others to join with us. Jehovah is our God, our
covenant God, therefore let him have the homage of our praise; and he is
so gracious and happy a God that our praise may best be expressed in
joyful song.

"For it is pleasant; and praise is comely." It is pleasant and proper,
sweet and suitable to laud the Lord Most High. It is refreshing to the
taste of the truly refined mind, and it is agreeable to the eye of the
pure in heart, it is delightful both to hear and to see a whole assembly
praising the Lord. These are arguments for song-service which men who
love true piety, real pleasure, and strict propriety will not despise.
Please to praise, for praise is pleasant, praise the Lord in the beauty
of holiness, for praise is comely. Where duty and delight, benefit and
beauty unite, we ought not to be backward. Let each reader feel that he
and his family ought to constitute a choir for the daily celebration of
the praises of the Lord.

[Psa 147:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#002.md)

"The Lord doth build up Jerusalem." God appears both in the material and
spiritual world as a Builder and Maker, and therein he is to be praised.
His grace, wisdom, and power are all seen in the formation and
establishment of the chosen seat of his worship; once a city with
material wall, but now a church composed of spiritual stones. The Jews
rejoiced in the uprising of their capital from its ruins, and we triumph
in the growth of the church from among a godless world. "He gathereth
together the outcasts of Israel"; and thus he repairs the waste places,
and causes the former desolations to be inhabited. This sentence may
relate to Nehemiah and those who returned with him; but there is no
reason why it should not with equal fitness be referred to David, who,
with his friends, was once an outcast, but ere long became the means of
building up Jerusalem. In any case, the Psalmist ascribes to Jehovah all
the blessings enjoyed; the restoration of the city and the restoration
of the banished he equally traces to the divine hand. How clearly these
ancient believers saw the Lord present, working among them and for them!
Spiritually we see the hand of God in the edification of the church, and
in the ingathering of sinners. What are men under conviction of sin but
outcasts from God, from holiness, from heaven, and even from hope? Who
could gather them from their dispersions, and make citizens of them in
Christ Jesus save the Lord our God? This deed of love and power he is
constantly performing. Therefore let the song begin at Jerusalem our
home, and let every living stone in the spiritual city echo the strain;
for it is the Lord who has brought again his banished ones, and builded
them together in Zion.

[Psa 147:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#003.md)

"He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds." This the
Holy Spirit mentions as a part of the glory of God, and a reason for our
declaring his praise: the Lord is not only a Builder, but a Healer; he
restores broken hearts as well as broken walls. The kings of the earth
think to be great through their loftiness; but Jehovah becomes really so
by his condescension. Behold, the Most High has to do with the sick and
the sorry, with the wretched and the wounded! He walks the hospitals as
the good Physician! His deep sympathy with mourners is a special mark of
his goodness. Few will associate with the despondent, but Jehovah
chooses their company, and abides with them till he has healed them by
his comforts. He deigns to handle and heal broken hearts: he himself
lays on the ointment of grace, and the soft bandages of love, and thus
binds up the bleeding wounds of those convinced of sin. This is
compassion like a God. Well may those praise him to whom he has acted so
gracious a part. The Lord is always healing and binding: this is no new
work to him, he has done it of old; and it is not a thing of the past of
which he is now weary, for he is still healing and still binding, as the
original hath it. Come, broken hearts, come to the Physician who never
fails to heal: uncover your wounds to him who so tenderly binds them up!

[Psa 147:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#004.md)

"He telleth the number of the stars." None but he can count the mighty
host, but as he made them and sustains them he can number them. To
Jehovah stars are as mere coins, which the merchant tells as he puts
them into his bag. "He calleth them all by their names." He has an
intimate acquaintance with each separate orb, so as to know its name or
character. Indeed, he gives to each its appropriate title, because he
knows its constitution and nature. Vast as these stars are, they are
perfectly obedient to his bidding; even as soldiers to a captain who
calls their names, and allots them their stations. Do they not rise, and
set, and move, or stand, precisely according to his order? What a change
is here from [Psa 147:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#003.md)! Read the two
without a break, and feel the full force of the contrast. From stars to
sighs is a deep descent! From worlds to wounds is a distance which only
Infinite compassion can bridge. Yet he who acts a surgeon's part with
wounded hearts, marshals the heavenly host, and reads the muster-roll of
suns and their majestic systems. O Lord, it is good to praise thee as
ruling the stars, but it is pleasant to adore thee as healing the broken
in heart!

[Psa 147:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#005.md)

"Great is our Lord." Our Lord and King is great - magnanimous, infinite,
inconceivably glorious. None can describe his majesty, or reckon up the
number of his excellences. "And of, great power." Doing as he wills, and
willing to do mighty deeds. His acts reveal something of his might, but
the mass of his power is hidden, for all things are possible with God,
even the things impossible with men. "His understanding is infinite."
There is no fathoming his wisdom, or measuring his knowledge. He is
infinite in existence, in power, and in knowledge, as these three
phrases plainly teach us. The gods of the heathen are nothing, but our
God filleth all things. And yet how condescending! For this is he who so
tenderly nurses the sick souls, and waits to be gracious to sinful men.
He brings his boundless power and infinite understanding to bear upon
human distress for its assuagement and sanctification. For all these
reasons let his praise be great: even could it be infinite, it would not
exceed his due. In the building of his church and the salvation of
souls, his greatness, power, and wisdom are all displayed: let him be
extolled because of each of these attributes.

[Psa 147:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#006.md)

"The Lord lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to the
ground." He reverses the evil order of things. The meek are down, and he
lifts them up; the wicked are exalted, and he hurls them down to the
dust. The Lord loves those who are reverent to himself, humble in their
own eyes, and gentle to their fellow-men, these he lifts up to hope, to
peace, to power, to eternal honour. When God lifts a man, it is a lift
indeed. Proud men are, in their own esteem, high enough already; only
those who are low will care to be lifted up, and only such will Jehovah
upraise. As for the wicked, they must come down from their seats of vain
glory. God is accustomed to overthrow such; it is his way and habit.
None of the wicked shall in the end escape. To the earth they must go;
for from the earth they came, and for the earth they live. It is one of
the glories of our God for which his saints praise him, that he hath put
down the mighty from their seats, and hath exalted them of low degree.
Well may the righteous be lifted up in spirit and the wicked be downcast
as they think of the judgments of the Lord God.

In this verse we see the practical outcome of that character of Jehovah,
which leads him to count and call the stars as if they were little
things, while he deals tenderly with sorrowful men, as if they were
precious in his esteem. He is so great that nothing is great to him, and
he is so condescending that nothing is little to him: his infinite
majesty thus naturally brings low the lofty and exalts the lowly.

[Psalms 147:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 147:7</span></span>

7 Sing unto the Lord with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto
our God'

8 Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth,
who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.

9 He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry.

10 He delighteth not in the strength of the horse - he taketh not
pleasure in the legs of a man.

11 The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in
his mercy.

[Psa 147:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#007.md)

In this paragraph the contrast announced in the former section is
enlarged upon from another point of view, namely, as it is seen in
nature and in providence.

"Sing unto the Lord with thanksgiving;" or rather, "respond to Jehovah."
He speaks to us in his works, let us answer him with our thanks. All
that he does is gracious, every movement of his hand is goodness;
therefore let our hearts reply with gratitude, and our lips with song.
Our lives should be responses to divine love. Jehovah is ever engaged in
giving, let us respond with thanksgiving.

"Sing praise upon the harp unto our God." Blend music with song. Under a
dispensation of ritual the use of music was most commendable, and
suitable in the great congregation, those of us who judge it to be less
desirable for public worship, under a spiritual economy, because it has
led to so many abuses, nevertheless rejoice in it in our privacy, and
are by no means insensible to its charms. It seems a profanation that
choice minstrelsy should so often be devoted to unworthy themes' the
sweetest harmonies should be consecrated to the honour of the Lord. He
is our God, and this fact is one choice joy of the song. We have chosen
him because he has chosen us; and we see in him peculiarities which
distinguish him from all the pretended deities of those among whom we
dwell. He is our God in covenant relationship for ever and ever, and to
him be praise in every possible form.

[Psa 147:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#008.md)

"Who covereth the heaven with clouds." He works in all things, above as
well as below. Clouds are not caused by accident, but produced by God
himself, and made to assume degrees of density by which the blue
firmament is hidden. A sky-scape might seem to be a mere fortuitous
concourse of vapours, but it is not so: the Great Artist's hand thus
covers the canvas of the heavens. "Who prepareth rain for the earth."
The Lord prepares clouds with a view to rain, and rain with an eye to
the fields below. By many concurrent circumstances all things are made
ready for the production of a shower; there is more of art in the
formation of a rain-cloud and in the fashioning of a rain-drop, than
appears to superficial observers. God is in the vapour, and in the
pearly drop which is born of it. "Who maketh grass to grow upon the
mountains." By the far-reaching shower he produces vegetation where the
hand of man is all unknown. He cares not only for Goshen's fertile
plains, but for Carmel's steep ascents. God makes the heavens the
servants of the earth, and the clouds the irrigators of the mountain
meadows. This is a kind of evolution about which there can be no
dispute. Nor does the Lord forget the waste and desolate places, but
causes the lone hills to be the first partakers of his refreshing
visitations. This is after the manner of our God. He not only causes
rain to descend from the heavens to water the grass, and thus unites the
skies and the herbs by a ministry of mercy; but he also thinks of the
rocky ledges among the hills, and forgets not the pastures of the
wilderness. What a God is this!

"Passing by the rich and great,

For the poor and desolate."

[Psa 147:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#009.md)

"He giveth to the beast his food." By causing the grass to grow on the
hills the Lord feeds the cattle. God careth for the brute creation. Men
tread grass under foot as though it were nothing, but God causeth it to
grow; too often men treat their cattle with cruelty, but the Lord
himself feedeth them. The great God is too good, and, indeed, too great
to overlook things that are despised. Say not, "Doth God care for oxen?"
Indeed he does, and he permits himself to be here described as giving
them their food as husbandmen are wont to do. "And to the young ravens
which cry." These wild creatures, which seem to be of no use to man; are
they therefore worthless? By no means; they fill their place in the
economy of nature. When they are mere fledgelings, and can only clamour
to the parent birds for food, the Lord does not suffer them to starve,
but supplies their needs. Is it not wonderful how such numbers of little
birds are fed! A bird in a cage under human care is in more danger of
lacking seed and water than any one of the myriads that fly in the open
heavens, with no owner but their Creator, and no provider but the Lord.
Greatness occupied with little things makes up a chief feature of this
Psalm. Ought we not all to feel special joy in praising One who is so
specially remarkable for his care of the needy and the forgotten? Ought
we not also to trust in the Lord? for he who feeds the sons of the raven
will surely nourish the sons of God! Hallelujah to him who both feeds
the ravens and rules the stars! What a God art thou, O Jehovah!

[Psa 147:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#010.md)

"He delighteth not in the strength of the horse." Not to great and
strong animals doth the Creator in any measure direct his special
thought; but in lesser living things he has equal pleasure. If man could
act the Creator's part, he would take peculiar delight in producing
noble quadrupeds like horses, whose strength and speed would reflect
honour upon their maker; but Jehovah has no such feeling; he cares as
much for helpless birds in the nest as for the war-horse in the pride of
its power. "He taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man." These are the
athlete's glory, but God hath no pleasure in them. Not the capacities of
the creature, but rather its weakness and necessity, win the regard of
our God. Monarchs trust in their cavalry and infantry; but the King of
kings exults not in the hosts of his creatures as though they could lend
power to him. Physical or material greatness and power are of no account
with Jehovah; he has respect to other and more precious qualities. Men
who boast in fight the valour of gigantic might, will not find
themselves the favourites of God: though earthly princes may feast their
eyes upon their Joabs and their Abners, their Abishais and Asahels, the
Lord of hosts has no pleasure in mere bone and muscle. Sinews and thews
are of small account, either in horses or in men, with Him who is a
spirit, and delights most in spiritual things. The expression of the
text may be viewed as including all creature power, even of a mental or
moral kind. God does not take pleasure in us because of our attainments,
or potentialities: he respects character rather than capacity.

[Psa 147:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#011.md)

"The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in
his mercy." While the bodily powers give no content to God, spiritual
qualities are his delight. He cares most for those emotions which centre
in himself, the fear which he approves is fear of him, and the hope
which he accepts is hope in his mercy. It is a striking thought that God
should not only be at peace with some kinds of men, but even find a
solace and a joy in their company. Oh! the matchless condescension of
the Lord, that his greatness should take pleasure in the insignificant
creatures of his hand. Who are these favoured men in whom Jehovah takes
pleasure? Some of them are the least in his family, who have never risen
beyond hoping and fearing. Others of them are more fully developed, but
still they exhibit a blended character composed of fear and hope: they
fear God with holy awe and filial reverence, and they also hope for
forgiveness and blessedness because of the divine mercy. As a father
takes pleasure in his own children, so doth the Lord solace himself in
his own beloved ones, whose marks of new birth are fear and hope. They
fear, for they are sinners; they hope, for God is merciful. They fear
him, for he is great; they hope in him, for he is good. Their fear
sobers their hope; their hope brightens their fear: God takes pleasure
in them both in their trembling and in their rejoicing.

Is there not rich cause for praise in this special feature of the divine
character? After all, it is a poor nature which is delighted with brute
force; it is a diviner thing to take pleasure in the holy character of
those around us. As men may be known by the nature of the things which
give them pleasure, so is the Lord known by the blessed fact that he
taketh pleasure in the righteous, even though that righteousness is as
yet in its initial stage of fear and hope.

[Psalms 147:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 147:12</span></span>

12 Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.

13 For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy
children within thee.

14 He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the finest of
the wheat.

15 He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth very
swiftly.

16 He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes.

17 He casteth forth his ice like morsels' who can stand before his cold?

18 He sendeth out his word, and melteth them, he causeth his wind to
blow, and the waters flow.

19 He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto
Israel.

20 He hath not dealt so with any nation - and as for his judgments, they
have not known them. Praise ye the Lord.

[Psa 147:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#012.md)

"Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion." How the poet
insists upon praise; he cries praise, praise, as if it were the most
important of all duties. A peculiar people should render peculiar
praise. The city of peace should be the city of praise; and the temple
of the covenant God should resound with his glories. If nowhere else,
yet certainly in Zion there should be joyful adoration of Zion's God.
Note, that we are to praise the Lord in our own houses in Jerusalem as
well as in his own house in Zion. The holy city surrounds the holy hill,
and both are dedicated to the holy God, therefore both should ring with
hallelujahs.

[Psa 147:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#013.md)

"For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates." Her fortifications
were finished, even to the fastenings of the gates, and God had made all
sound and strong, even to her bolts and bars: thus her security against
invading foes was guaranteed. This is no small mercy. Oh, that our
churches were thus preserved from all false doctrine and unholy living!
This must be the Lord's doing; and where he has wrought it his name is
greatly to be praised. Modern libertines would tear down all gates and
abolish all bars; but so do not we, because of the fear of the Lord. "He
hath blessed thy children within thee." Internal happiness is as truly
the Lord's gift as external security. When \_he Lord@blesses "thy sos in
the midst of thee," thou art, O Zion, filled with a happy, united,
zealous, prosperous, holy people, who dwell in communion with God, and
enter into the joy of their Lord. When God makes thy walls salvation thy
gates must be praise. It would little avail to fortify a wretched,
starving city; but when the walls are strengthened, it is a still
greater joy to see that the inhabitants are blessed with all good gifts.
How much our churches need a present and abiding benediction.

[Psa 147:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#014.md)

"He maketh peace in thy borders." Even to the boundaries quiet extends;
no enemies are wrangling with the borderers. If there is peace there, we
may be sure that peace is everywhere. "When a man's ways please the Lord
he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him" Peace is from the
God of peace. Considering the differing constitutions, conditions,
tastes, and opinions of men, it is a work of God when in large churches
unbroken peace is found year after year; and it is an equal wonder if
wordlings, instead of persecuting the godly, treat them with marked
respect. He who builds Zion is also her Peace-maker, the Lord and Giver
of peace. "And filleth thee with the finest of the wheat." Peace is
attended with plenty, - plenty of the best food, and of the best sort of
that food. It is a great reason' for thanksgiving when men's wants are
so supplied that they are filled: it takes much to fill some men:
perhaps none ever are filled but the inhabitants of Zion; and they are
only to be filled by the Lord himself. Gospel truth is the finest of the
wheat, and those are indeed blessed who are content to be filled
therewith, and are not hungering after the husks of the world. Let those
who are filled with heavenly food fill their mouths with heavenly
praise.

[Psa 147:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#015.md)

"He sendeth forth his commandment upon the earth." His messages fly
throughout his dominions' upon earth his warrants are executed as well
as in heaven. From his church his word goes forth; from Zion he missions
the nations with the word of life. "His word runneth very swiftly": his
purposes of love are speedily accomplished. Oriental monarchs laboured
hard to establish rapid postal communication; the desire, will, and
command of the Lord flash in an instant from pole to pole, yea, from
heaven to earth. We who dwell in the centre of the Lord's dominions may
exceedingly rejoice that to the utmost extremity of the realm the divine
commandment speeds with sure result, and is not hindered by distance or
time. The Lord can deliver his people right speedily, or send them
supplies immediately from his courts above. God's commands in nature and
providence are fiats against which no opposition is ever raised; say,
rather, to effect which all things rush onward with alacrity. The
expressions in the text are so distinctly in the present that they are
meant to teach us the present mission and efficiency of the word of the
Lord, and thus to prompt us to present praise.

[Psa 147:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#016.md)

Here follow instances of the power of God upon the elements. "He giveth
snow like wool." As a gift he scatters the snow, which falls in flakes
like fleecy wool. Snow falls softly, covers universally, and clothes
warmly, even as wool covers the sheep. The most evident resemblance lies
in the whiteness of the two substances; but many other likenesses are to
be seen by the observant eye. It is wise to see God in winter and in
distress as well as in summer and prosperity. He who one day feeds us
with the finest of the wheat, at another time robes us in snow, he is
the same God in each case, and each form of his operation bestows a gift
on men. "He scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes." Here again the
Psalmist sees God directly and personally at work. As ashes powder the
earth when men are burning up the rank herbage; and as when men cast
ashes into the air they cause a singular sort of whiteness in the places
where they fall, so also does the frost. The country people talk of a
black frost and a white frost, and the same thing may be said of ashes,
for they are both black and white. Moreover, excessive cold burns as
effectually as great heat, and hence there is an inner as well as an
outer likeness between hoarfrost and ashes. Let us praise the Lord who
condescends to wing each flake of snow and scatter each particle of
rime. Ours is no absent or inactive deity, he worketh all things, and is
everywhere at home.

[Psa 147:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#017.md)

"He casteth forth his ice like morsels." Such are the crumbs of hail
which he casts forth, or the crusts of ice which he creates upon the
waters. These morsels are his ice, and he casts them abroad. The two
expressions indicate a very real presence of God in the phenomena of
nature. "Who can stand before his cold?" None can resist the utmost
rigours of cold any more than they can bear the vehemence of heat. God's
withdrawals of light are a darkness that may be felt, and his
withdrawals of heat are a cold which is absolutely omnipotent. If the
Lord, instead of revealing himself as a fire, should adopt the opposite
manifestation of cold, he would, in either case, consume us should he
put forth all his power. It is ours to submit to deprivations with
patience, seeing the cold is his cold. That which God sends, whether it
be heat or cold, no man can defy with impunity, but he is happy who bows
before it with child-like submission. When we cannot stand before God we
will gladly lie at his feet, or nestle under his wings.

[Psa 147:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#018.md)

"He sendeth out his word, and melteth them." When the frost is sharpest,
and the ice is hardest, the Lord intervenes; and though he doth no more
than send his word, yet the rocks of ice are dissolved at once, and the
huge bergs begin to float into the southern seas. The phenomena of
winter are not so abundant in Palestine as with us, yet they are
witnessed sufficiently to cause the devout to bless God for the return
of spring. At the will of God snow, hoar-frost, and ice disappear, and
the time of the opening bud and the singing of birds has come. For this
let us praise the Lord as we sun ourselves amid the spring flowers. "He
causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow." The Lord is the great
first cause of everything; even the fickle, wandering winds are caused
by him. Natural laws are in themselves mere inoperative rules, but the
power emanates directly from the Ever-potent One. The soft gales from
the south, which bring a general thaw, are from the Lord, as were those
wintry blasts which bound the streams in icy bonds. Simple but effectual
are the methods of Jehovah in the natural world; equally so are those
which he employs in the spiritual kingdom; for the breath of his Holy
Spirit breathes upon frozen hearts, and streams of penitence and love
gush forth at once.

Observe how these two sentences the word and the wind go together in
nature. They attend each other in grace; the gospel and the Holy Spirit
co-operate in salvation. The truth which the Spirit breathed into
prophets and apostles he breathes into dead souls, and they are
quickened into spiritual life.

[Psa 147:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#019.md)

"He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto
Israel." He who is the Creator is also the Revealer. We are to praise
the Lord above all things for his manifesting himself to us as he does
not unto the world. Whatever part of his mind he discloses to us,
whether it be a word of instruction, a statute of direction, or a
judgment of government, we are bound to bless the Lord for it. He who
causes summer to come in the place of winter has also removed the
coldness and death from our hearts by the power of his word, and this is
abundant cause for singing unto his name. As Jacob's seed of old were
made to know the Lord, even so are we in these latter days; wherefore,
let his name be magnified among us. By that knowledge Jacob is ennobled
into Israel, and therefore let him who is made a prevailing prince in
prayer be also a chief musician in praise. The elect people were bound
to sing hallelujahs to their own God. Why were they so specially
favoured if they did not, above all others, tell forth the glory of
their God?

[Psa 147:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#020.md)

"He hath not dealt so with any nation." Israel had clear and exclusive
knowledge of God, while others were left in ignorance. Election is the
loudest call for grateful adoration. "And as for his judgments, they
have not known them"; or, "and judgments, they had not known them," as
if not knowing the laws of God, they might be looked upon as having no
laws at all worth mentioning. The nations were covered with darkness,
and only Israel sat in the light. This was sovereign grace in its
fullest noontide of power. "Praise ye the Lord." When we have mentioned
electing, distinguishing love, our praise can rise no higher, and
therefore we close with one more hallelujah.
