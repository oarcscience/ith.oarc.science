[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 18:0</span></span>

Title - "To the chief Musician, a Psalm of David, the servant of the
Lord, who spake unto the Lord the words of this song in the day that the
Lord delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand
of Saul." We have another form of this Psalm with significant variations
(2 Sam 22), and this suggests the idea that it was sung by David at
different times when he reviewed his own remarkable history, and
observed the gracious hand of God in it all. Like Addison's hymn
beginning, "When all thy mercies, O my God," this Psalm is the song of a
grateful heart overwhelmed with a retrospect of the manifold and
marvellous mercies of God. We will call it the grateful retrospect. The
title deserves attention. David, although at this time a king, calls
himself "the servant of Jehovah," but makes no mention of his royalty;
hence we gather that he counted it a higher honour to be the Lord's
servant than to be Judah's king. Right wisely did he judge. Being
possessed of poetic genius, he served the Lord by composing this Psalm
for the use of the Lord's house; and it is no mean work to conduct or to
improve that delightful part of divine worship, the singing of the
Lord's praises. Would that more musical and poetical ability were
consecrated, and that our chief musicians were fit to be trusted with
devout and spiritual psalmody. It should be observed that the words of
this song were not composed with the view of gratifying the taste of
men, but were spoken unto Jehovah. It were well if we had a more single
eye to the honour of the Lord in our singing, and in all other hallowed
exercises. That praise is little worth which is not directed solely and
heartily to the Lord. David might well be thus direct in his gratitude,
for he owed all to his God, and in the day of his deliverance he had
none to thank but the Lord whose right hand had preserved him. We too
should feel that to God and God alone we owe the greatest debt of honour
and thanksgiving.

If it be remembered that the second and the forty-ninth verses are both
quoted in the New Testament ([Heb
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#013.md); [Rom
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#009).md)as the words of the Lord Jesus,
it will be clear that a greater than David is here. Reader, you will not
need our aid in this respect: if you know Jesus you will readily find
him in his sorrows, deliverance, and triumphs all through this wonderful
Psalm.

Division - The first three verses are the proem or preface in which the
resolve to bless God is declared. Delivering mercy is most poetically
extolled from [Psa 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#004.md) to [Psa
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#019.md); and then the happy songster,
from [Psa 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#020.md) to [Psa
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#028.md), protests that God had acted
righteously in thus favouring him. Filled with grateful joy he again
pictures his deliverance, and anticipates future victories from verse
29-45; and in closing speaks with evident prophetic foresight of the
glorious triumphs of the Messiah, David's seed and the Lord's anointed.

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Whole Psalm

The general argument of the Psalm may be thus stated: it is a
magnificent eucharistic ode. It begins with a celebration of the
glorious perfections of the Divinity, whose assistance the speaker had
so often experienced. He describes, or rather, he delineates, his
perils, the power of his enemies, his sudden deliverance from them, and
the indignation and power of his divine deliverer manifested in their
overthrow. He paints these in so lively colours, that while we read we
seem to see the lightning, to hear the thunders, to feel the earthquake.
He afterwards describes his victories, so that we seem to be
eye-witnesses of them, and take part in them. He predicts a wide
extended empire, and concludes with a lofty expression of grateful
adoration of Jehovah, the Author of all his deliverances and triumphs.
The style is highly oratorical and poetical, sublime, and full of
uncommon figures of speech. It is the natural language of a person of
the highest mental endowments, under a divine inspiration, deeply
affected by remarkable divine benefits, and filled with the most lofty
conceptions of the divine character and dispensations. - John Brown,
D.D., 1853.

Whole Psalm

Kitto, in "The Pictorial Bible," has the following note upon 2 Samuel
22: - "This is the same as the eighteenth Psalm.... The Rabbins reckon
up seventy-four differences between the two copies, most of them very
minute. They probably arose from the fact that the poem was, as they
conjecture, composed by David in his youth, and revised in his later
days when he sent it to the chief musician. The present is, of course,
supposed to be the earlier copy."

Whole Psalm

The eighteenth Psalm is called by Michaelis more artificial, and less
truly terrible than the Mosaic odes. In structure it may be so, but
surely not in spirit. It appears to many besides us, one of the most
magnificent lyrical raptures in the Scriptures. As if the poet had
dipped his pen in "the brightness of that light which was before his
eye," so he describes the descending God. Perhaps it may be objected
that the nodus is hardly worthy of the vindex - to deliver David from
his enemies, could Deity ever be imagined to come down? But the objector
knows not the character of the ancient Hebrew mind. God in its view had
not to descend from heaven; he was nigh - a cloud like a man's hand
might conceal - a cry, a look might bring him down. And why should not
David's fancy clothe him, as he came, in a panoply befitting his
dignity, in clouds spangled with coals of fire? If he was to descend,
why not in state? The proof of the grandeur of this Psalm is in the
fact, that it has borne the test of almost every translation, and made
doggerel erect itself, and become divine. Even Sternhold and Hopkins its
fiery whirlwind lifts up, purifies, touches into true power, and then
throws down, helpless and panting, upon their ancient common. Perhaps
the great charm of the eighteenth, apart from the poetry of the descent,
is the exquisite and subtle alternation of the I and the Thou. We have
spoken of parallelism, as the key to the mechanism of Hebrew song. We
find this as existing between David and God - the delivered and the
deliverer - beautifully pursued throughout the whole of this Psalm. "I
will love thee, O Lord, my strength." "I will call upon the Lord, who is
worthy to be praised." "He sent from above; he took me; he drew me out
of many waters." "Thou wilt light my candle." "Thou hast given me the
shield of thy salvation." "Thou hast girded me with strength unto
battle." "Thou hast given me the necks of mine enemies." "Thou hast made
me the head of the heathen." It has been ingeniously argued, that the
existence of the I suggests, inevitably as a polar opposite, the thought
of the Thou, that the personality of man proves thus the personality of
God; but, be this as it may, David's perception of that personality is
nowhere so intense as here. He seems not only to see, but to feel and
touch, the object of his gratitude and worship. - George Gilfillan, in
"The Bards of the Bible," 1852.

Whole Psalm

He that would be wise, let him read the Proverbs; he that would be holy,
let him read the Psalms. Every line in this book breathes peculiar
sanctity. This Psalm, though placed among the first, was penned among
the last, as the preface assures us, and is left as the epitome of the
general history of David's life. It is twice recorded in the Scripture
(2 Sam 22, and in this book of Psalms), for the excellency and sweetness
thereof; surely that we should take double notice of it. Holy David,
being near the shore, here looks on his former dangers and deliverances
with a thankful heart, and writes this Psalm to bless the Lord: as if
each of you that are grown into years should review your lives and
observe the wonderful goodness and providence of God towards you; and
then sit down and write a modest memorial of his most remarkable
mercies, for the comfort of yourselves and posterity; an excellent
practice. What a comfort would it be for you to read how good your God
was to your father or grandfather, that are dead and gone! So would your
children rejoice in the Lord upon the reading of his goodness to you;
and you cannot have a better pattern for this than holy David, who wrote
this Psalm when he was threescore and seven years old; when he had
outlived most of his troubles, and almost ready for his journey to his
Father in heaven, he resolves to leave this good report of him upon
earth. And I pray mark how he begins: he sets not up trophies to
himself, but triumphs in his God - "I will love thee, O Lord, my
strength." As the love of God is the beginning of all our mercies, so
love to God should be the end and effect of them all. As the stream
leads us to the spring, so all the gifts of God must lead us to the
giver of them. Lord, thou hast saved me from sickness, "I will love
thee;" from death and hell, "I will love thee; on me thou hast bestowed
grace and comfort, "I will love thee, O Lord, my strength." And after he
had heaped on God all the sweet names he could devise ([Psa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002).md), as the true saint thinks he can
never speak too well of God, or too ill of himself, then he begins his
narrative. 1. Of his dangers ([Psa
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#004).md); "Snares of death," "Floods of
ungodly men," "Sorrows of hell." Hell and earth are combined against
each holy man, and will trouble sufficiently in this world, if they
cannot keep him out of a better. 2. Of his retreat, and that was,
earnest prayer to God ([Psa 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#006).md), "I
called upon the Lord, and cried unto my God." When our prayers are cries
ardent and importunate, then they speed: "My cry came before him, even
into his ears." The mother trifles while the child whimpers, but when he
raises his note - strains every nerve and cries every vein - then she
throws all aside, and gives him his desire. While our prayers are only
whispers, our God can take his rest; but when we fall to crying, "Now
will I arise, saith the Lord." 3. Of his rescue ([Psa
18:7-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#007).md), by the powerful and terrible
arm of the Lord, who is in a lofty strain brought in to his servant's
help, as if he would mingle heaven and earth together, rather than leave
his child in the lion's paws. 4. Of the reason of this gracious dealing
of God with him([Psa 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#020), etc..md) He
was a righteous person, and he had a righteous cause. And thereupon he
turns to God, saying, Thou hast dealt with me just as thou art wont to
do, for "with the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful; with an
upright man thou wilt show thyself upright." - Richard Steele's "Plain
Discourse upon Uprightness," 1670.

Whole Psalm

Sometimes the Lord cheers and comforts the hearts of his people with
smiling and reviving providences, both public and personal. There are
times of lifting up, as well as casting down by the hand of providence.
The scene changes, the aspects of providence are very cheerful and
encouraging; their winter seems to be over; they put off their garments
of mourning; and then, ah, what sweet returns are made to heavenly
gracious souls! Doth God lift them up by prosperity? they also will lift
up their God by praises. See title, and verses 1-3 of Psalm 18. So
Moses, and the people with him (Exodus 15), when God had delivered them
from Pharaoh, how do they exalt him in a song of thanksgiving, which for
the elegancy and spirituality of it, is made an emblem of the doxologies
given to God in glory by the saints. [Rev
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#001.md). - John Flavel.

Title

"The servant of the Lord;" - the name given to Moses ([Jos
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md), [Jos
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#013.md), [Jos
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#015.md), and in nine other places of that
book) and to Joshua ([Jos 24:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#029.md); [Jdg
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#008).md); but to none other except David
(here, and in the title to [Psa
36:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#001).md). Cp. [Act
13:36](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#036.md), ὑπηρετήσας. This is
significant; reminding us of the place occupied by David who extended
the power of Israel over the whole region allotted to them by Divine
promise. - W. Kay, 1871.

Title

This Psalm, which is entitled a shirah (or song), is David's hymn of
praise to God for his deliverance from all his enemies (see the title,
and above, 2 Sam 22), and has an appropriate place in the present group
of Psalms, which speak of resurrection after suffering. It is entitled a
Psalm of David, "the servant of the Lord," and thus is coupled with
another Psalm of deliverance, [Psa
36:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#001.md). - Christopher Wordsworth.

[Psa 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#001.md)

"I will love thee, O Lord." - The word whereby the Psalmist expresseth
his entire affection, in the noun signifieth a womb, and importeth such
an affection as cometh from the innermost part of man (דהם matrix), from
his bowels, from the bottom of his heart, as we speak. It is, therefore,
oft put for such pity and compassion as moveth the bowels. Some,
therefore, thus translate that phrase, "From my innermost bowels will I
love thee, O Lord." To give evidence of his entire and ardent love of
God, he oft professeth his wonderful great love to God's commandments,
whereof he saith with admiration, "Oh, how I love thy law! I love thy
commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold. I love them exceedingly"
([Psa 119:97](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#097.md), [Psa
119:127](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#127.md), [Psa
119:167](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#167).md); therefore, he saith to God,
"Consider how I love thy precepts" ([Psa
119:159](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#159).md). - William Gouge, 1575-1653.

[Psa 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#001.md)

"I will love thee." Intimately as a mother loves the child that comes
out of her womb. - Westminster Assembly's Annotations, 1651.

[Psa 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#001.md), [Psa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002.md)

God hath, as it were, made himself over to believers. David doth not
say, God will give or bestow salvation upon me; but he saith, "He is the
horn of my salvation." It is God himself who is the salvation and the
portion of his people. They would not care much for salvation if God
were not their salvation. It more pleaseth the saints that they enjoy
God, than that they enjoy salvation. False and carnal spirits will
express a great deal of desire after salvation, for they like salvation,
heaven, and glory well; but they never express any longing desire after
God and Jesus Christ. They love salvation, but they care not for a
Saviour. Now that which faith pitcheth most upon is God himself; he
shall be my salvation, let me have him, and that is salvation enough; he
is my life, he is my comfort, he is my riches, he is my honour, and he
is my all. Thus David's heart acted immediately upon God, "I will love
thee, O Lord, my strength. The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my
deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and
the horn of my salvation, and my high tower." It pleased holy David more
that God was his strength, than that God gave him strength; that God was
his deliverer, than that he was delivered; that God was his fortress,
his buckler, his horn, his high tower, than that he gave him the effect
of all these. It pleased David, and it pleases all the saints more that
God is their salvation, whether temporal or eternal, than that he saves
them: the saints look more at God than at all that is God's. - Joseph
Caryl.

[Psa 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#001.md), [Psa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002.md)

David speaks like one in love with God, for he doth adorn him with
confession of praise, and his mouth is filled with the praise of the
Lord, which he expresseth in this exuberancy and redundancy of holy
oratory. - Edward Marbury.

[Psa 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002.md)

"The Lord is my rock." As the rocks that are hard to be clambered unto
are good refuges to fly unto from the face of pursuers, so God is the
safety of all such as in distress do fly to him for succour. - Robert
Cawdray.

[Psa 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002.md)

"My deliverer." He who betook himself to one of these inaccessible
retreats, was sometimes obliged by famine to surrender to his enemy, who
lay in wait for him beneath; but Jehovah gives him not only security but
liberty; not only preserves him, as it were, in an inaccessible retreat,
but at the same time enables him to go forth in safety. - Jarchi.

[Psa 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002.md)

"The horn of my salvation, "The allusion here is doubtful. Some have
supposed the reference to be to the horns of animals, by which they
defend themselves and attack their enemies. "God is to me, does for me,
what their horns do for them." Others consider it as referring to the
well-established fact, that warriors were accustomed to place horns, or
ornaments like horns, on their helmets. The horn stands for the helmet;
and "the helmet of salvation" is an expression equivalent to "a saving,
a protecting helmet." Others consider the reference as to the corners or
handles of the altar in the court of the tabernacle or temple, which are
called its horns. Others suppose the reference to be to the highest
point of a lofty and precipitous mountain, which we are accustomed to
call is peak. No doubt, in the Hebrew language, horn is used for
mountain as in [Isa 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001.md). A very
fertile mountain is called a horn of oil. The sense is substantially the
same, whichever of these views we take; though, from the connection with
"shield" or "buckler," I am induced to consider the second of these
views as the most probable. It seems the same idea as that expressed,
[Psa 140:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#007.md), "Thou hast covered," and
thou wilt cover "my head in the day of battle." - John Brown.

[Psa 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002.md)

"The horn of my salvation." Horns are the well-known emblems of strength
and power, both in the sacred and profane writers; by a metaphor taken
from horned animals, which are frequently made subjects of comparison by
poetical writers, and the strength of which, whether for offence or
defence, consists principally in their horns. Bruce speaks of a
remarkable head-dress worn by the governors of provinces in Abyssinia,
consisting of a large broad fillet, bound upon their foreheads and tied
behind their heads, and having in the middle of it a horn, of a conical
piece of silver, gilt, about four inches long, much in the shape of our
common candle extinguishers. It is called kirn or horn, and is only worn
on reviews or parades after victory. He supposes this, like other
Abyssinian usages, to be taken from the Hebrews, and is of opinion that
there are many allusions to the practice in Scripture, in the
expressions, "lifting up the horn," "exalting the horn," and the like. -
Richard Mant.

[Psa 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002.md)

"The Lord is my high tower." If a man do run to a tower, yet if that be
a weak and an insufficient tower, without men and munition, and a
ruinous shaken tower; or if a man do make choice of a tower, a strong
sufficient tower, yet if in his danger he betake not himself to that
tower, but he sit still; or if he sit not still, yet he but only go and
walk on easily towards it, he may well be met withal, and a danger may
arrest him, surprise him, and cut him off before he get the tower over
his head. But the man that will be safe, as he must choose a strong
tower, so must go to, nay, run into that tower. Running will not secure
a man unless the tower be strong .... David was got unto his tower, and
in that tower there was thundering ordinance, and David put fire to them
by prayer, [Psa 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#006.md), "In my distress
I called upon the Lord, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of
his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears." Here David
prays and gives fire to the cannon, and what followed? See [Psa
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#007.md), [Psa
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#008.md), [Psa
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#013.md), [Psa
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#014.md). "Then the earth shook and
trembled," etc. "There went up a smoke out of his nostrils," etc. "The
Lord also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail
stones and coals of fire. Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered
them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them." There were no
guns nor ordinance invented and in use in David's time, and yet David's
prayers being in this tower, did him as good service against his enemies
as all the ordnance and cannons in the world have done. David had
thundering ordinance, and with them discomfited his enemies long before
powder and guns were invented. It is a memorable and well known story of
that Christian legion that was in Marcus Aurelius's army: the enemy
being in great straits, those Christian soldiers did by their prayers
not only procure rain, by which his languishing army was refreshed, but
also obtained hail mixed with thunderbolts against his enemies, upon
which he honoured them with the name of Legio fulminatrix, the
Thundering Legion. They used David's cannon against the enemy, and
discharged that thundering ordnance by their prayers, and that to the
confusion of their enemies. - Jeremiah Dyke's "Righteous Man's Tower,"
1639.

[Psa 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002.md)

"My high tower." Even as the fowls of the air, that they may escape the
nets and snares of the fowlers, are wont to fly up on high; so we, to
avoid the infinite snares of innumerable temptations, must fly to God;
and lift up ourselves from the corruptions, lying vanities, and
deceitful sleights of the world. - Robert Cawdray.

[Psa 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#003.md)

"I will call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised." Prayer and
invocation of God should always be joined with praises and
thanksgivings, and used as a means whereby faith shall extract the good
which it knoweth is in God, and of which he hath made promise. - David
Dickson.

[Psa 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#003.md)

"So shall I be saved from mine enemies." Whoso comes to God as he should
will not call in vain. The right kind of prayer is the most potent
instrumentality known on earth. - William S. Plumer.

[Psa 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#004.md)

"Sorrows of dearth." It is heaven's peculiar to be the land of the
living; all this life is at must the shadow of death, the gate of death,
the sorrows of death, the snares of death, the terrors of death, the
chambers of death, the sentence of death, the savour of death, the
ministration of death, the way of death. - Matthew Griffith. 1634.

[Psa 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#004.md)

"The bands or cords of death encompassed me." It is not very easy to fix
the precise meaning of the phrase, "bands" or "cords" of death. It may
either be considered as equivalent to "the bands by which the dead are
bound," in which case, to be encircled with the bands of death is just a
figurative expression for being dead; or it may be considered as
equivalent to the bands in which a person is bound in the prospect of a
violent death, and by which his violent death is secured, he being
prevented from escaping. It has been supposed by some, that the allusion
is to the ancient mode of hunting wild animals. A considerable tract of
country was surrounded with strong ropes. The circle was gradually
contracted, till the object of pursuit was so confined as to become an
easy prey to the hunter. These cords were the cords of death, securing
the death of the animal. The phrase is applicable to our Lord in both
senses; but as "the floods" of wickedness, or the wicked, are
represented as making him afraid subsequently to his being encircled
with the cords of death, I am disposed to understand it in the latter of
these two senses. - John Brown.

[Psa 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#004.md)

"The floods." There is no metaphor of more frequent occurrence with the
sacred poets, than that which represents dreadful and unexpected
calamities under the images of overwhelming waters. This image seems to
have been especially familiar with the Hebrews, inasmuch as it was
derived from the peculiar habit and nature of their own country. They
had continually before their eyes the river Jordan, annually overflowing
its banks, when at the approach of summer the snows of Libanus and the
neighbouring mountains melted, and, suddenly pouring down in torrents,
swelled the current of the river. Besides, the whole country of
Palestine, although it was not watered by many perennial streams, was,
from the mountainous character of the greater part of it, liable to
numerous torrents, which precipitated themselves through the narrow
valleys after the periodical rainy seasons. This image, therefore,
however known, and adopted by other poets, may be considered as
particularly familiar and, as it were, domestic with the Hebrews; who
accordingly introduce it with greater frequency and freedom. - Robert
Lowth (Bishop), 1710-1787.

[Psa 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#005.md)

"The snares of death prevented me." The word "snares," signifies such
traps or gins as are laid for birds and wild beasts. The English word"
prevent" has changed its meaning in some measure since our authorised
translation of the Bible was made. Its original meaning is to "come
before." - John Brown.

[Psa 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#006.md)

"In my distress." If you listen even to David's harp, you shall hear as
many hearse-like airs as carols; and the pencil of the Holy Spirit hath
laboured more in describing the afflictions of Job than the felicities
of Solomon. Prosperity is not without many fears and distastes; and
adversity is not without comforts and hopes. We see, in needleworks and
embroideries, it is more pleasing to have a lively work upon a sad and
solemn ground, than to have a dark and melancholy work upon a lightsome
ground; judge, therefore, of the pleasures of the heart by the pleasures
of the eye. Certainly virtue is like precious odours - most fragrant
when they are crushed; for prosperity doth best discover vice, but
adversity doth best discover virtue. - Francis Bacon, Baron of Verulam,
etc., 1561-1626.

[Psa 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#006.md)

"I called upon the Lord and cried." Prayer is not eloquence but
earnestness; not the definition of helplessness, but the feeling of it;
it is the cry of faith to the ear of mercy. - Hannah Moore, 1745-1833.

[Psa 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#006.md)

"He heard my voice out of his temple," etc. The diles or chamberlains
among the Romans, had ever their doors standing open for all who had
occasion of request or complaint to have free access to them. "God's
mercy-doors are wide open to the prayers of his faithful people." The
Persian kings held it a piece of their silly glory to deny an easy
access to their greatest subjects. It was death to solicit them
uncalled. Esther herself was afraid. But the king of heaven manifesteth
himself to his people, he calls to his spouse, with, "Let me see thy
face, let me hear thy voice," etc., and assigneth her negligence herein
as the cause of her soul-sickness. The door of the tabernacle was not of
any hard or debarring matter, but a veil, which is easily penetrable.
And whereas in the temple none came near people are now a kingdom of
priests, and are said to worship in the temple, and at the altar. [Rev
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#001.md). "Let us therefore draw near with
a true heart in full assurance of faith:" "let us come boldly to the
throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in
time of need." [Heb 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022.md); [Heb
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#016.md). - Charles Bradbury's "Cabinet of
Jewels," 1785.

[Psa 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#006.md)

Oh! how true is that saying, that "Faith is safe when in danger, and in
danger when secure; and prayer is fervent in straits, but in joyful and
prosperous circumstances, if not quite cold and dead, at least
lukewarm." Oh, happy straits, if they hinder the mind from flowing forth
upon earthly objects, and mingling itself with the mire; if they favour
our correspondence with heaven, and quicken our: love to celestial
objects, without which, what we call life, may more properly deserve the
name of death! - Robert Leighton, D.D.

[Psa 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#006.md), [Psa
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#007.md)

The prayer of a single saint is sometimes followed with wonderful
effects; "In my distress I called upon the Lord, and cried unto my God:
he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even
into his ears Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of
the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth:" what then can a
thundering legion of such praying souls do? It was said of Luther, iste
vir potuit cum Deo quicquid voluit, That man could have of God what he
would; his enemies felt the weight of his prayers; and the church of God
reaped the benefits thereof. The Queen of Scots professed she was more
afraid of the prayers of Mr. Knox, than of an army of ten thousand men.
These were mighty wrestlers with God, howsoever contemned and vilified
among their enemies. There will a time come when God will hear the
prayers of his people who are continually crying in his ears, "How long,
Lord, how long?" - John Flayel.

[Psa 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#007.md)

"Then the earth shook and trembled." The word גּעשׂ signifies, to move
or shake violently: it is employed, also, to denote the reeling and
staggering of a drunken man. [Jer
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#016.md). - John Morison, in loc.

[Psa 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#007.md)

Let no appearing impossibilities make you question God's accomplishment
of any of his gracious words. Though you cannot see how the thing can be
done, 'tis enough if God hath said that he will do it. There can be no
obstructions to promised salvation which we need to fear. He who is the
God of this salvation and the Author of the promise will prepare his own
way for the doing of his own work, so that "every valley shall be
filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low." [Luk
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#005.md). Though the valleys be so deep
that we cannot see the bottom, and the mountains so high that we cannot
see the tops of them, yet God knows how to raise the one and level the
other. [Isa 63:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001.md). "I that speak in
righteousness (or faithfulness) am mighty to save." If anything would
keep back the kingdom of Christ, it would be our infidelity; but he will
come though he should find no faith on the earth. See [Rom
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#003.md). Cast not away your confidence
because he defers his performances. Though providences run cross, though
they move backwards and forwards, you have a sure and faithful word to
rely upon. Promises, though they be for a time seemingly delayed, cannot
be finally frustrated. Dare not to harbour such a thought within
yourselves as [Psa 77:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#008.md); "Doth his
promise fail for evermore?" The being of God may as well fail as the
promise of God. That which does not come in your time, will be hastened
in his time, which is always the more convenient season. Accuse him not
of slowness who hath said, "I come quickly," that is, he comes as soon
as all things are ready and ripe for his appearance. 'Tis as true that
"the Lord is not slack concerning his promise" ([Pe2
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#009).md), as that he is never guilty of
breaking this promise. Wait, therefore, how long soever he tarry; do not
give over expecting: the heart of God is not turned though his face be
hid; and prayers are not flung back, though they be not instantly
answered. - Timothy Cruso.

[Psa 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#007.md), [Psa
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#008.md)

The volcanic phenomena of Palestine open a question of which the data
are, in a scientific point of view, too imperfect to be discussed; but
there is enough in the history and literature of the people to show that
there was an agency of this kind at work. The valley of the Jordan, both
in its desolation and vegetation, was one continued portent; and from
its crevices ramified even into the interior of Judeea the startling
appearances, if not of the volcano, at least of the earthquake. Their
historical effect in the special theatres of their operation will appear
as we proceed; but their traces on the permanent feeling of the nation
must be noticed here. The writing of the psalmists and prophets abound
with indications which escape the eye of a superficial reader. Like the
soil of their country, they actually heave and labour with the fiery
convulsions which glow beneath their surface. - Arthur Penrhyn Stanley.

[Psa 18:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#007.md)

While Jesus hung on the cross a preternatural "darkness covered all the
land;" and no sooner had he yielded up his spirit, than "the vail of the
temple was rent in twain from the top even to the bottom, and the earth
did quake, and the rocks rent, and the graves were opened; and many
bodies of the saints that slept arose, and came out of the graves, after
his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many."
- John Brown.

[Psa 18:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#007.md)

In the night in which the Idumans lay before Jerusalem, there arose a
prodigious tempest and fierce winds, with most vehement rains, frequent
lightnings, and terrible thunderings, and great roarings of the shaken
earth; and it was manifest that the state of the universe was disordered
at the slaughter of men; so that one might guess that these were signs
of no small calamity.... At the day of Pentecost, when the priests, by
night, went into the inner temple, according to their custom, to execute
their office, they said they perceived, first of all, a shake and a
noise, and after that a sudden voice, "Let us go hence." ... A few days
after the feast of unleavened bread, a strange and almost incredible
sight was seen, which would, I suppose, be taken for a mere fable, were
it not related by such as saw it, and did not the miseries which
followed appear answerable to the signs; for, before the sun set, were
seen on high, in the air, all over the country, chariots and armed
regiments moving swiftly in the clouds, and encompassing the city. -
Flavius Josephus, 37-103.

[Psa 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#008.md)

"There went up a smoke out of his nostrils," עלה עשׁן בּאפּז . Or there
ascended into his nose, as the words, literally rendered, signify. The
ancients placed the seat of anger in the nose, or nostrils; because when
it grows warm and violent, it discovers itself, as it were, by a heated
vehement breath, that proceeds from them. - Samuel Chandler, D.D., F.R
and A.S.S., 1766.

[Psa 18:8-19](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#008.md)

David calls the full force of poetical imagery to aid, to describe in a
becoming manner the marvels of his deliverances lie means to say that
they were as manifest as the signs of heaven and earth, as sudden and
powerful as the phenomena in the kingdom of nature sunrise terrified
mortals. Deliverance being his theme, he might have taken the figure
from the peaceable phenomena of the heavens. But since man heeds heaven
more in anger than in blessing, and regards God more when he descends on
earth in the storm than in the rainbow, David describes the blessed
condescension of God by the figure of a tempest. In order to thoroughly
appreciate the beauty and truthfulness of this figure, we should
endeavour to realise the full power of an Oriental storm, as it is
described in [Psa 29:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001.md). Solitary
lightning precedes the discharge - this is meant by the coals in [Psa
29:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#008.md) : the clouds approach the
mountain summits - the heavens bow, as [Psa
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#009.md) has it; the storm shakes its
pinions; enwrapped in thick clouds as in a tent, God descends to the
earth; hail (not unfrequently attending Eastern storms) and lightning
issue from the black clouds, through the dissolving layers of which is
seen the fiery splendour which hides the Lord of nature. He speaks, and
thunder is his voice; he shoots, and flashes of lightning are his
arrows. At his rebuke, and at the blast of his breath the earth recedes
- the sea foams up, and its beds are seen - the land bursts, and the
foundations of the world are discovered. And lo! an arm of deliverance
issues forth from the black clouds, and the destructive fire grasps the
wretched one who had cried out from the depths, pulls him forth, and
delivers him from all his enemies! Yes, the hand of the Lord has done
marvellous things in the life of David. But the eye of faith alone could
perceive in them all the hand of God. Thousands whose experiences of the
delivering hand of God are not less signal than those of David, stop
short at the powers of nature, and instead of bending the knee before
the All-merciful God, content themselves to express with cold hearts
their admiration of the changes of the destiny of man. - Augustus F.
Tholuck, D.D., Ph.D. 1856.

[Psa 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#009.md)

"He bowed the heavens also, and came down." As in a tempest the clouds
come nearer to the earth, and from the mountains to the valleys, so the
Psalmist adopts this figure peculiar to such occasions as described
God's near approach to judgment ([Psa
144:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#005.md), etc.; [Heb
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#006).md); "and darkness was under his
feet." We have here the increase of the horrors of the tempest, and its
still nearer approach, accompaniment of God's descent on Mount Sinai
([Exo 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#021.md); [Deu
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#011).md); and it invests his throne, to
veil from us the overwhelming majesty of deity. [Psa
97:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#002.md). But this darkness, while it
hides his coming judgment, bespeaks sorrow and anguish to the objects of
his wrath. [Luk 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#025.md), [Luk
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#026.md). - W. Wilson, in 1oc.

[Psa 18:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#009.md)

"He also bowed the heavens,

And thence he did descend;

And thickest clouds of darkness did

Under his feet attend.

And he upon a cherub rode,

And thereon he did fly;

Yea, on the swift wings of the wind,

His flight was from on high.

He darkness made his secret place;

About him for his tent

Dark waters were, and thickest clouds

Of the airy firmament."

Scotch Version, 1649.

[Psa 18:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#009.md)

"In his descent, bow'd heaven with earth did meet,

And gloomy darkness roll'd beneath his feet;

A golden winged cherub he bestrid,

And on the swiftly-flying tempest rid.

He darkness made his secret cabinet;

Thick fogs and dropping clouds about him set;

The beams of his bright presence these expel,

Whence showers of burning coals and hailstones fell."

George Sandys, 1577-1643.

[Psa 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#010.md)

"Cherub." The Hebrew name hath affinity with Rechub, a chariot, used in
[Psa 104:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#003.md), almost in like sense as
"cherub" is here; and the cherubims are called a chariot, [Ch1
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#018.md); and God's angels are his
chariots, [Psa 68:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#018.md), and they seem to
be meant in this place; for as the angels are said to fly, [Dan
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#021.md); so the cherubims had wings, [Exo
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#020.md), and are by the apostle called
"cherubims of glory," [Heb 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#005.md). In
[Psa 80:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#002.md), God is said "to sit on the
cherubims," as here, to ride; and "a cherub" may be put for many, or all
he cherubims, as chariot for chariots, [Psa
68:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#018.md). - Henry Ainsworth.

[Psa 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#010.md)

"Cherubs." The "cherub" with the countenances of man, the lion, he bull,
and the eagle (combining in itself, as it were, the intelligence,
majesty, strength, and life of nature), was a symbol of the powers of
nature. When powerful elements, as in a storm, are serving God, he is
said to "ride on a cherub." - Augustus F. Tholuck.

[Psa 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#010.md)

"Cherub."

"He on the wings of cherub rode sublime

On the crystalline sky."

John Milton.

[Psa 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#010.md)

When God comes to punish his foes and rescue his people, nothing has
ever surprised his friends or foes more than the admirable swiftness
with which moves and acts: He flies "upon the wings of the wind." -
William S. Plumer.

[Psa 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#010.md)

Every circumstance that can add to the splendour of Jehovah's descent
upon his enemies is thrown into the narrative by the inspired poet. It
not enough that the heavens should bend beneath him, and that clouds of
darkness should be seen rolling, in terrible majesty, under his feet;
cherubic legions also e the willing supporters of his throne, and, swift
as air, he flies "upon the wings the wind." Into this amazing scene the
awful appendages of the mercy-seat are introduced; on the bending
heavens, the cloudy chariot rides sublime, and the winds of heaven bear
it majestically along. - J. Morison.

[Psa 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#012.md)

"Coals of fire. The word signifies, living, burning coals. Where the
lightning fell, it devoured all before it, and burned whatever it
touched into burning embers. - Samuel Chandler.

[Psa 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#014.md)

"Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them," etc. O that you who
are now strangers to God would but consider these things! O that you
would but think what this battle may be, where the combatants are so
unequal! Stand still, O sun, in the valley of Ajalon, till the Lord have
avenged him of his enemies! Muster yourselves, O ye stars, and fight in
your courses against those miserable sinners that have waged war against
their Maker; plant your mighty cannons, shoot down huge hailstones,
arrows of fire, and hot thunderbolts! Oh, how do the wounded fall! How
many are the slain of the Lord, multitudes in the Valley of Decision,
for the day of the Lord is terrible. Behold, God's enemies falling by
thousands, behold the garments rolling in blood, hear the prancing of
his terrible ones, the mountains are covered with horses and chariots of
fire. God's soldiers run from one place to another with their flaming
swords in their hands, armed with the justice of God, jealousy, power,
and indignation! Oh, the dreadful slaughter that is made! Millions,
millions fall; they are not able to stand; not one of them can lift up
his hand; their hearts fail them; paleness and trembling hath seized
upon the stoutest of them all. The bow of the Lord is strong; from the
blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of the Lord
turneth not back, the sword of the Almighty returns not empty. How do
the mighty ones fall in this battle! A hot battle indeed, in which none
escape! Who is he that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah?
He that is glorious in his apparel, and thy garments like him that
treadeth the wine fat? I have trodden the wine-press alone, and of the
people there was none with me. For I will tread them in mine anger and
trample them in my fury; and I will bring down their strength to the
earth: the hand of the Lord shall be known, the power of the mighty
Jehovah shall be felt, and his indignation towards his enemies. For
behold he will come with fire and with chariots like a whirlwind, to
render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire; for by
fire and by his sword will he plead with all flesh; and the slain of the
Lord shall be many, and the saints shall go forth and look upon the
carcases of the men that have transgressed against me. For their worm
shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched, and they shall be
an abhorring unto all flesh. Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire,
and brimstone, and a horrible tempest. This shall be the portion of
their cup! This it is to fight against God! This it is to defy the Lord
of Hosts! - James Janeway.

"He shot out his lightnings." בּדקים דב. lxx ἀστραπἀς ἐπλήθυνε. Fulgura

thunderbolts; or, shot them out thick one after another; as the word
properly signifies.

think it should be translated, and melted them; namely, the heavens. -

turned into dry ground ([Exo 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#021.md),

"Drew me out of many waters." This hath reference to Moses' case, who
was "drawn out of the water," and thereupon called Mosheh ([Exo
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#010).md); that word Mashah is used here
by David, and nowhere else in Scripture. "Waters," signify troubles, and
sometimes multitudes of people. - H. Ainsworth.

[Psa 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#018.md)

"They prevented me in the day of my calamity;" i.e., came on me suddenly
unawares, when I was unprovided and helpless, and must have destroyed me
had not God upheld and supported me when I was in danger of perishing.
God was to the Psalmist למשׁען, for a staff to support him. What the
staff is to one that is ready to fall, the means of recovering and
preserving him; that was God to David in the time of his extremity. For
he several times preserved him from Saul, when he, David, thought his
destruction by him almost unavoidable. See [Sa1
23:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#026.md), [Sa1
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#027.md). - Samuel Chandler.

[Psa 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#018.md)

"They prevented me in the day of my calamity but the Lord was my stay."
When Henry the Eighth had spoken and written bitterly against Luther;
saith Luther, Tell the Henries, the bishops, the Turks, and the devil
himself, do what they can, we are the children of the kingdom,
worshipping of the true God, whom they, and such as they, spit upon and
crucified. And of the same spirit were many martyrs. Basil affirms of
the primitive saints, that they had so much courage and confidence in
their sufferings, that many of the heathens seeing their heroic zeal and
constancy, turned Christians. - Charles Bradbury.

[Psa 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#020.md)

"The Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the
cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me." We must stand our ground,
and be stiff for ourselves against all misjudgings. It is good to be
zealously affected always in a good matter, whether it respects the
glory of God immediately and alone, or whether it respects the credit of
our brethren or our own. To be famous in the world, and as those giants
in the old world ([Gen 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#004).md) renown,
or, as the original text hath it, men of name, is a very great vanity;
but to protect and preserve our good name is a great and necessary duty.
- Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#021.md)

"I have not wickedly departed from my God;" that is, with a purpose and
resolution of heart to continue in a way of sinning; and that is the
property of sincerity. A man indeed may be overtaken and surprised by a
temptation, but it is not with a resolution to forsake God and to cleave
unto the sin, or rest in it. He will not sleep in it, spare it, or
favour it; that is, to do wickedly against God, to have a double heart
and a double eye; to look upon two objects, partly at God and partly at
sin; so to keep God, as to keep some sin also, as it is with all
false-hearted men in the world. They look not upon God alone, let them
pretend to religion never so much, yet they look not unto God alone, but
upon something else together with God; as Herod regarded John, but
regarded his Herodias more; and the young man in the gospel, comes to
Christ, yet he looks after his estate; and Judas followed in Christ, yet
looks after the bag; this is to depart wickedly from God. - William
Strong, 1650.

[Psa 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#021) (last clause.md)

Although a godly man may break a particular commandment again and again
against knowledge, yet his knowledge never suffers him to go so far as
to venture knowingly to break the covenant of grace with God, and to
depart from him; when he hath gone on so far in a sin as he comes to
apprehend he must break with God, and lose him if he goes on any
further, this apprehension stays him, stops and brings him back again;
he may presumptuously venture (though seldom; and always to his cost) to
commit an act of sin against knowledge, because he may withal think,
that by one act the covenant is not broken, nor all friendship and love
hazarded between God and him, nor his interest in the state of grace,
nor God, quite lost by it, though he may well think he would be
displeased with him; but if he should begin to allow himself in it, and
to continue to go on again and again in it, then he knows the covenant
would be broken, it cannot stand with grace; and when this apprehension
comes, and comes in strongly, he cannot sin against it, for this were to
cast away the Lord, and to depart wickedly from him, now so he doth not.
So David, though he sinned highly and presumptuously, yet says he, "I
have not departed wickedly from my God;" that is, I have not so far
departed from him as though I apprehended I should utterly lose my
interest in him, yet I would go on. No; for his is my God, there lies
the consideration that kept him from departing from him. So [Psa
44:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#017.md), "We have not dealt falsely in
thy covenant," says the church there. Many acts of displeasing him may
pass and be ventured, but if the holy soul thinks that the covenant lay
at stake, that he and God must utterly part and break off, thus far he
will never go. - Thomas Goodwin.

[Psa 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#022.md), [Psa
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#023.md)

An unsound soul will not take notice of such a precept as opposeth his
special sin; such a precept must go for a blank which the soul throws
by, and will not think of, but as a conscience now and then put him in
mind of it, whether he will or no. But it is not so with a man in whom
sincerity is: that precept which doth most oppose that sin to which he
is most inclined, he labours to obey as well as any other. An unsound
soul sets so many of God's statutes before him, as rulers to walk by, as
suits with himself and the times, and no more. Such precepts as oppose
his special corruptions, or displease the times, and so expose him to
suffering, these he baulks and puts away, as David here saith, and calls
them as the rotten Scribes and Pharisees were wont to do, "least
commandments," small things not to be regarded; which rottenness Christ
took up roundly in those ironical words, "Whosoever shall break one of
these least commandments, shall be called the least in the kingdom of
God." Godly sincerity makes no difference of greatest and least between
the precepts of God, but sets all before a man as a rule to walk by, and
makes the soul laborious to observe all. "Then shall I not be ashamed,
when I have respect unto all thy commandments." [Psa
119:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#006.md). - Nicholas Lockyer, 1649.

[Psa 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#023.md)

"I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity."
He who says, "Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,
I delight to do thy will, O my God; yea, thy law is within my heart;"
and who by the apostle, in the tenth chapter of the epistle to the
Hebrews, is identified with Jesus Christ, says also ([Psa
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#012).md), "innumerable evils have
compassed me about; mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I
am not able to look up: they are more than the hairs of mine head;
therefore mine heart faileth me;" and in the [Psa
41:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001.md), "He whose familiar friend, to
whom he had committed a trust, who ate of his bread, lifted up his heel
against him," whom our Lord in the thirteenth chapter of the gospel of
John identifies with himself, says ([Joh
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#004).md), "Lord, be merciful to me: heal
my soul for I have sinned;" I am guilty "before thee." The difficulty is
removed by the undoubtedly true principle - the principle which, above
all others, gives Christianity its peculiar character - "He who knew no
sin, was made sin;" "On his righteous servant, Jehovah made to fall the
iniquities of us all." In this sense, "innumerable iniquities compassed
him," the iniquities made to fall on him made "his" as to their
liabilities - by divine appointment laid hold of him. In the sense of
culpa - blame-worthiness - he had no sin. In the sense of reatus -
liability to the penal effects of sin - never had any one so much sin to
bear as he - "He bore the sins of many." - John Brown.

[Psa 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#023.md)

"I was upright before him." Hence observe: - first, that a godly man may
have his heart upright and perfect even in the imperfection of his ways.
Secondly, a man that is sincere is in God's account a perfect man:
sincerity is the truth of all grace, the highest pitch that is to be
attained here. Thirdly, sincerity of heart gives a man boldness even in
the presence of God, notwithstanding many failings. The Lord doth
"charge his angels with folly," how much more man that "dwells in a
house of clay"? Job 4. David, whose faith failed, and who had said, "I
shall one day perish by the hand of Saul," and whose tongue had faltered
also to Abimelech, the priest; three or four several lies he had told;
yet David can say to God, that he was perfect with him for all that. It
is a strange boldness that the saints have in the presence of God by
virtue of the new covenant. All their sins shall be laid open at the
last day as a cancelled bond, that they wonder how they shall look upon
them and not blush; but the same spirit of sonship that shall give them
perfect boldness then, doth give them boldness in a great measure even
now in this life; that they shall be able to say, "Neither height nor
depth," etc., nothing "shall separate us from the love of Christ." -
William Strong.

[Psa 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#023.md)

"I was upright," etc. An upright Christian will not allow himself in any
known sin; he dares not touch the forbidden fruit. [Gen
39:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#009.md). "How then can I do this great
wickedness, and sin against God?" Though it be a complexion-sin, he
disinherits it. There is no man but doth propend and incline more to one
sin than another; as in the body there is one humour predominant, or as
in the hive there is one master-bee; so in the heart there is one
master-sin; there is one sin which is not only near to a man as the
garment, but dear to him as the right eye. This is Satan's fort-royal,
all his strength lies here; and though we beat down his out-works, gross
sin, yet if we let him hold this fort of complexion-sin, it is as much
as he desires. The devil can hold a man as fast by this one link, as by
a whole chain of vices. The fowler hath the bird fast enough by one
wing. Now, an upright Christian will not indulge himself in this
complexion-sin: "I was upright before him, and kept myself from mine
iniquity." An upright Christian takes the sacrificing knife of
mortification, and runs it through his dearest sin. Herod did many
things, but there was one sin so dear to him, that he would sooner
behead the prophet, than behead that sin. Herod would have a gap for his
incest. An upright heart is not only angry with sin (which may admit of
reconciliation), but hates sin; and if he sees this serpent creeping
into his bosom, the nearer it is the more he hates it. - Thomas Watson.

[Psa 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#023.md)

"I kept myself." Kept himself! Who made man his own keeper? It's the
Lord that is his keeper: he is the keeper of Israel, and the preserver
of man. If a man cannot keep himself from sorrow, how is he able to keep
himself from sin? God indeed in our first conversion works upon us as he
did upon the earth, or Adam's body in paradise, before he breathed a
soul into it, and made it a living creature; such a power as Christ put
forth on Lazarus in his grave, for we are "dead in trespasses and sins;"
but yet being living he must walk and act of himself, the Lord will have
us to cooperate together with him, for we are built upon Christ, not as
dead, but as "living stones." [Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005.md). The grace whereby we are made
alive is his, and the power is his; he it is that works in us both to
will and to do, when we perform anything; and yet by his grace we do it
also; ille facit ut nos faciamus, quae praecepit (Augustine). - William
Strong.

[Pe1 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#023.md)

"I kept myself from mine iniquity." It is possible to keep ourselves
from such sins as David did, who professes here of himself great
sincerity, that he had kept himself from that iniquity to which he was
strongly tempted, and which he was prone to fall into. The method which
holy David made use of gives us the first and best direction; and that
is, by constant and fervent prayer to implore the divine aid and the
continual assistance of his Holy Spirit, that God would not only keep us
from falling into them, but even turn our hearts from inclining to them,
and help us to see our folly and our danger. For alas I we are not able
of ourselves to help ourselves, not so much as to think a good thought,
much less to resist an evil inclination, or a strong temptation; but
"our sufficiency is of God:" "It is God (says the Psalmist here), that
girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect:" [Psa
18:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#032.md) .... Next, that we take care to
avoid such things and decline such occasions as are most likely to snare
us and gain upon us, lest one thing hook in another, and we be caught in
the gin before we suspect the danger. - Henry Dove, 1690.

[Psa 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#023.md)

"Mine iniquity." A man's darling sin may change with the change of a
man's condition, and some occasion that may present itself. What was
Saul's and Jehu's sin before they came unto the crown we know not; but
surely it was that wherein their lust did afterwards run out - the
establishing a kingdom upon their posterity. Wantonness may be the
darling of a man's youth, and worldliness the darling of his age; and a
man's being raised unto honour, and having the opportunities that he had
not in times past, the lust may run in another channel, he having now
such an opportunity as before he never expected. - William Strong.

[Psa 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#023.md)

"Mine iniquity." There is some particular sin to which one is more prone
than to another, of which he may say by way of emphasis, 'tis "mine
iniquity," at which he may point with his finger, and say, "That's it."
... There are more temptations to some sins than others, from the
different professions or courses of life men take upon themselves. If
they follow the court I need not tell you what temptations and snares
there are to divers sins, and what danger there is of falling into them,
unless your vows for virtue, and a tender regard to the honour which
cometh of God only, keep you upright. If they be listed in the camp,
that tempts them to rapine and violence, neglect of God's worship, and
profaneness. If they exercise trading and merchandise, they meet with
greater enticements to lying and cozening, over-reaching and unjust
dealing; and the mystery of some trades, as bad men manage them, is a
downright "mystery of iniquity." If husbandry, to anxiety about the
things of the world, a distrust of God's providence, or murmuring
against it. Nay, I could wish in the most sacred profession of all there
might be an exception made in this particular; but Paul tells us that
even in his days "some preached Christ even of envy and strife," some
for filthy lucre only, as well as "some of good will." [Phi
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#015.md). - Henry Dove.

[Psa 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#023.md)

"Mine iniquity." The actual reign of sin is commonly of some particular
master-lust, which is as the viceroy over all the rest of the sins in
the soul, and commands them all as lord paramount, and makes them all
subservient and subordinate unto it; and this is according to custom,
calling, constitution, abilities, relations, and according to the
different administrations of the Spirit of God; for though God be not
the author of sin, yet he is the orderer of sin. So that it is that way
of sin and death that a man chooseth to himself, he having looked abroad
upon all the contentments of the world, his own corrupt inclination doth
choose unto himself to follow with greatest sweetness and contentment
and delight as that wherein the happiness of his life consists; that as
in the body there is in every one some predominant humour, so there is
in the body of sin also; that as in the natural man, though there be all
the faculties, yet some faculties are in some more lively and vigorous
than in others, some are more witty, some are more strong, some quick of
sight, some have a ready ear, and others a nimble tongue, etc. So it is
in the old man also; there is all the power of sin in an unregenerate
man, but in some more dexterous one way than another; as men in the
choice of calling, some have a greater inclination to one thing than to
another, so it is in the choice of contentments also: as in the appetite
for food, so it is in lust, being nothing else but the appetite of the
creature corrupted to some sinful object. - William Strong.

[Psa 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#023.md)

Growth in mortification.... Men may deceive themselves when they
estimate their progress herein by having overcome such lusts as their
natures are not so prone unto. The surest way is to take a judgment of
it from the decay of a man's bosom-sin, even as David did estimate his
uprightness by his "keeping himself from his iniquity;" so a man of his
growth in uprightness. When physicians would judge of a consumption of
the whole, they do it not by the falling away of any part whatever, as
of the flesh in the face alone, or any the like; such a particular
abatement of flesh in some one part may come from some other cause; but
they use to judge by the falling away of the brawn of the hands, or arms
and thighs, etc., for these are the more solid parts. The like judgments
do physicians make upon other diseases, and of the abatement of them
from the decrease in such symptoms as are pathognomical, and proper, and
peculiar to them. In like manner also the estimate of the progress of
the victories of a conqueror in an enemy's kingdom is not taken from the
taking or burning of a few villages or dorps, but by taking the forts
and strongest holds, and by what ground he hath won upon the chief
strength, and by what forces he hath cut off the main army. Do the like
in the decrease of, and victory over, your lusts. - Thomas Goodwin.

[Psa 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#023.md)

We must always remember that though the grace of God prevents us, that
we may have a good will, and works in us when we have it, that so we may
find success; yet in vain do we expect the continuance of his help
without diligent endeavours. Whilst he assists our weakness, he does not
intend to encourage our laziness, and therefore we are also "to labour,
and strive according to his working, which worketh in us mightily," as
the apostle expresses it. [Col 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#029.md). -
Henry Dove.

[Psa 18:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#024.md)

As you may see a proportion between sins and punishments which are the
rewards of them, that you can say, Such a sin brought forth this
affliction, it is so like the father; so you might see the like
proportion between your prayers and your walking with God, and God's
answers to you, and his dealings with you. So did David; "According to
the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me," etc. His speech notes
some similitude or likeness; as, for example, the more by-ends or carnal
desires you had in praying, and the more you mingled of these with your
holy desires, and the more want of zeal, fervency, etc., were found in
your prayers, the more you shall, it may be, find of bitterness mingled
with the mercy, when it is granted, and so much imperfection, and want
of comfort in it. So says David in this same Psalm ([Psa
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#025.md), [Psa
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#026).md), "With the pure thou wilt show
thyself pure." Pure prayers have pure blessings; et contra, "With the
froward thou wilt show thyself froward." And again, as you in praying
sometimes slackened and grew cold, so you might see the business in like
manner to cool, and cast backward; as, "When Moses' hands were down,
Amalek prevailed; but when they were lifted up, Israel had the better."
[Exo 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#012.md). God let him see a
proportion, which argued his prayer was the means of prevailing. A man
finds in praying that his suit sometimes sticks, and goes not on as he
expected; this is because he gives not so good a fee as he was wont, and
doth not ply God and solicit him; but on the contrary, when he was
stirred up to pray, then still he found things to go well. By this a man
may clearly see that it was the prayer which God did hear and regarded.
Thus, likewise, when a man see hills and dales in a business, fair hopes
often and then all dashed again, and the thing in the end brought to
pass, let him look back upon his prayers. Didst not thou in like manner
just deal with God? when thou hadst prayed earnestly, and thought thou
hadst even carried it, then dash all again by interposing some sin, and
thus again and again? Herein God would have you observe a proportion,
and it may help you to discern how and when they are answered and
obtained by prayer, because God deals thus with you therein in such a
proportion to your prayers. - Thomas Goodwin.

[Psa 18:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#024.md)

Even as the sun, which, unto eyes being sound and without disease, is
very pleasant and wholesome, but unto the same eyes, when they are
feeble, sore and weak, is very troublesome and hurtful, yet the sun is
ever all one and the selfsame that was before; so God, who hath ever
shown himself benign and bountiful to those who are kind and
tender-hearted towards his saints, and are merciful to those who show
mercy. But unto the same men, when they fall into wickedness and grow to
be full of beastly cruelty, the Lord showeth himself to be very wrathful
and angry, and yet is one and the same immutable God from everlasting to
everlasting. - Robert Cawdray.

[Psa 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#025.md)

"With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful; with an upright man
thou wilt shew thyself upright." "An upright" - the same word is oft
translated "perfect," he is good throughout, though not thoroughly; not
one that personates religion, but that is a religious person. He is
perfect, because he would be so. So Noah is termed ([Gen
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#009).md);" Noah was a just man and perfect
(i.e., upright) in his generation: "he was a good man in a bad age. He
was like a glowing spark of fire in a sea of water, which is perfect
goodness; and therefore the Holy Ghost doth so hang upon his name, as if
he could not give over - it is an excellent preacher's observation -
[Gen 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#008.md), "But Noah was a just man and
perfect in his generation, and Noah walked with God. And Noah found
grace in the eyes of the Lord. These are the generations of Noah: Noah
begat three sons." Noah, Noah, Noah, I love the sound of thy name; and
so are all your names precious to God, though hated by men, if the name
of God be dear and sweet to you. 'Tis also sometimes translated "plain."
[Gen 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#027.md). Jacob was אישׁ תּם, "a
plain," that is, an upright man, "dwelling in tents." Esau was "a
cunning hunter," but Jacob was a plain man without welt or gard; you
might well know his heart by his tongue, save once when Rebekah put a
cunning trick into his head, otherwise he was a most "upright,"
downright man. And the plain meaning of it is, a simple, cordial,
unfeigned, and exact man: this is the man we are looking for.

"Man." This substantive the Hebrews use to drown in the adjective but
here the Holy Ghost exhibits a word, and a choice one too, signifying a
strong, valiant man; the same word ([Psa
45:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#003).md), "O mighty man!" that's meant of
our Lord Christ, who was a most strong and valiant man, that could meet
the wrath of God, the malice of the devil, and the sin of man, in the
face and come off with triumph. And so the Dutch translate this clause
in 2 Sam 22: "With the right valiant person, thou behavest thyself
upright." In short, if the words were literally translated, they run
thus: - a man of uprightness: that is every way you behold him, an
upright man: like an even die, cast him which way you will he will be
found square and right; a stiff and strong man to tread down both lusts
within and temptations without; an Athanasius contra mundum, a Luther
contra Romam; this is a man of an excellent spirit, and such is our
upright man. "Thou wilt show thyself upright," or, "wilt be upright with
him;" for one word in the Hebrew makes all these six, "Thou wilt upright
it with him." If men will deal plainly with God, he will deal plainly
with them. He that is upright in performing his duty shall find God
upright in performing his promises. It is God's way to carry to men as
they carry to him. If thou hast a design to please him, he will have a
design to please thee; if thou wilt echo to him when he calls, he'll
echo to thee when thou callest. On the other side; if a man will wrestle
with God, he will wrestle with him; if thou wilt be fast and loose with
him, and walk frowardly towards him, thou shalt have as good as thou
bringest; if thou wilt provoke him with never-ending sins, he will
pursue thee with never-ending torments; if thou wilt sin in tuo eterno,
thou must suffer in suo eterno, and every man shall find like for
like.... An upright heart is single without division. Unto an hypocrite
there be "gods many and lords many," and he must have an heart for each;
but to the upright there is but one God the Father, and one Lord Jesus
Christ, and one heart will serve them both. He that fixes his heart upon
the creatures, for every creature he must have an heart, and the
dividing of his heart destroys him. [Hos
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#002.md). Worldly profits knock at the
door, he must have an heart for them; carnal pleasures present
themselves, he must have an heart for them also; sinful preferments
appear, they must have an heart too - Necessariorum numerus parvus,
opinionum nullus; of necessary object the number is few, of needless
vanities the number is endless. The upright man hath made choice of God
and hath enough. - Richard Steele.

[Psa 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#025.md)

"With the merciful," etc. In Jupiter's hall-floor there are set two
barrels of gifts, the one of good gifts or blessings, the other of evil
gifts or plagues. Thus spake Homer falsely of Jupiter; it may be truly
spoken of the true God, Jehovah; that he hath in his hand two cups, the
one of comforts, the other of crosses, which he poureth out
indifferently for the good and for the bad; "with the kind (or merciful)
he will shew himself kind, and with the froward, froward." Now this is
not to make God the author of evil, but of justice, which is good;
quorum deus non est author eorum est justus ultor, saith Augustine; "God
is not the author of sin, but he punisheth the sinner justly." - Miles
Smith (Bishop), 1632.

[Psa 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#026.md)

"With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure," etc. But doth the Lord take
colour from every one he meets, or change his temper as the company
changes? That's the weakness of sinful man: he cannot do so with whom
there is no variableness nor shadow of changing. God is pure, and
upright with the unclean and hypocritical, as well as with the pure and
upright, and his actions show him to be so. God shows himself froward
with the froward when he deals with him as he hath said he will deal
with the froward - deny them and reject them. God shows himself pure
with the pure, when he deals with them as he hath said he will - hear
them and accept them. Though there be nothing in purity and sincerity
which deserveth mercy, yet we cannot expect mercy without them. Our
comforts are not grounded upon our graces, but our comforts are the
fruits or consequents of our graces. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#026.md)

"The froward one." Here, as in the first promise, the two combatants
stand contrasted - the seed of the woman and the serpents - the
benignantly bountiful, perfect, pure One, and the froward one, whose
works he came to destroy, and who made it his great business to
circumvent him whom he feared. The literal meaning of the word is
"tortuous," or "crooked," and both the ideas of perversity and cunning
which the figure naturally suggests, are very applicable to "that old
serpent the devil." From the concluding part of the sentence, I think
there is no doubt that it is the latter idea that is intended to be
conveyed. God cannot deal perversely with any one; but he outwits the
wise, and takes the cunning in their own craftiness. - John Brown.

[Psa 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#026.md)

"With the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward." The Hebrew word in
the root signifieth to wrest or writhe a thing, or to wrest or turn a
thing, as wrestlers do their bodies. Hence by a trope, it is translated
often to wrestle, because a cunning man in wrestling, turneth and
windeth his body, and works himself in and out every way, to get an
advantage of his adversary any way; therefore your cunning-headed men,
your crafty men, are fitly presented under this word; they are like
wrestlers who turn and wind themselves in and out, and lie for all
advantages; or as we speak, they "lie at catch." A man knows not where
to have them, or what they mean when they speak plainest, or swear
solemnest; when we think we see their faces, we see but their vizards;
all their promises and performances too are under a disguise.... And
this word is applied to the Lord himself, "With the froward thou wilt
shew thyself froward;" that is, if men will be winding and turning, and
thinking to catch others or over-reach the Lord himself with tricks and
turnings of wit, the Lord will meet and answer them in their own kind;
he can turn as fast as they, he can put himself into such intricate
labyrinths of infinite wisdom and sacred craft, as shall entangle and
ensnare the most cunning wrestler or tumbler of them all. He will
Cretize the Cretians, supplant the supplanters of his people. - Joseph
Caryl.

[Psa 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#026.md)

"Wilt shew thyself froward." It is a similitude taken from wrestlers,
and noteth a writhing of one's self against an adversary. Compare
herewith [Deu 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#005.md). "They are a
perverse and crooked generation," the same two words that are here in
this text; the latter importeth that they wriggled and writhed after the
manner of wrestlers that wave up and down, and wind the other way, when
one thinks to have him here or there. But all will not serve their turn
to save them from punishment. God will be sure to meet with them, his
Word will lay hold on them, and their sin shall find them out. - John
Trapp.

[Psa 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#027.md)

"The afflicted... people." The word rendered "afflicted," properly
signifies "poor" or "needy." The persons spoken of are obviously
afflicted ones, for they need to be saved or delivered; but it is not
their afflictions, so much as their poverty, that is indicated by the
epithet here given them; and, from the poor being contrasted, not with
the wealthy, but with the proud - for that is the meaning of the
figurative expression, "the man of high looks" - it seems plain that,
though the great body of the class referred to have always been found
among the comparatively "poor in this world," the reference is to those
poor ones whom our Lord represents as "poor in spirit." - John Brown.

[Psa 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#027.md)

"High looks'" namely, the proud; the raising up of the eyebrows being a
natural sign of that vice. [Psa 101:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#005.md);
[Pro 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#017.md). - John Diodati.

[Psa 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#028.md)

"For thou wilt light my candle," etc. The Psalmist speaks in this place
of artificial light; "a candle," or "lamp;" which has been supposed to
be illustrated by the custom prevailing in Egypt of never suffering
their houses to be without lights, but burning lamps even through the
night, so that the poorest people would rather retrench part of their
food than neglect it. Supposing this to have been the ancient custom,
not only in Egypt, but in the neighbouring countries of Arabia and
Judaea, "the lighting of the lamp" in this passage may have had a
special allusion. In the parallel passage, [Sa2
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#029.md), Jehovah is figuratively styled
the "lamp" of the Psalmist, as above. - Richard Mant.

[Psa 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#028) (first clause.md)

"Thou also shalt" - when none else can. And notice too, how here, and
often elsewhere, the Psalmist begins with speaking of God, and ends with
speaking to him. So the bride in the Canticles, "Let him kiss me with
the kisses of his mouth, for thy love is better than wine." - Dionysius
the Carthusian (1471), quoted by J. M. Neale.

[Psa 18:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#029.md)

"By thee I have run through a troop," etc. David ascribes his victories
to God, declaring that, under his conduct, he had broken through the
wedges or phalanxes of his enemies, and had taken by storm their
fortified cities. Thus we see that, although he was a valiant warrior,
and skilled in arms, he arrogates nothing to himself. - John Calvin.

[Psa 18:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#029.md)

"By my God have I leaped over a wall;" or, "taken a fort." - Henry
Hammond.

[Psa 18:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#029.md)

"Leaped over a wall." This probably refers to his having taken some
remarkable town by scaling the ramparts. - John Kitto, in "The Pictorial
Bible."

[Psa 18:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#031.md)

"For who is God save the Lord?" Here first in the Psalms, occurs the
name Eloah, rendered God. It occurs more than fifty times in the
Scriptures, but only four times in the Psalms. It is the singular of
Elohim. Many have supposed that this name specially refers to God as an
object of religious worship. That idea may well be prominent in this
place. - William S. Plainer.

[Psa 18:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#032.md)

"It is God that girdeth me with strength." One of the few articles of
Eastern dress which I wore in the East, was the girdle, which was of
great use as a support to the body in the long and weary camel-rides
through the Desert. The support and strengthening I received in this
way, gave me a clearer idea than I had before the meaning of the
Psalmist. - John Anderson, in "Bible from Bible Lands," 1856.

[Psa 18:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#033.md)

"He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high
places'" that is, he doth give swiftness and speed to his church; as
Augustine interpreteth it, transcendendo spinosa, et umbrosa
implicamenta hujus saeculi, passing lightly through the thorny and shady
incumbrances of this world. "He will make me walk upon my high places."
David saith, "He setteth me upon high places." For, consider David, as
he then was, when he composed this Psalm, it was at the time when God
had delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of
Saul. For then God set his feet on high places, settling his kingdom,
and establishing him in the place of Saul. - Edward Marbury.

[Psa 18:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#033.md)

"He maketh my feet like hinds' feet:" משׁוּה דגלי כּאוּלוה. Celerity of
motion was considered as one of the qualities of an ancient hero.
Achilles is celebrated for being πὀδα ὠκύς. Virgil's Nisus is
hyperbolically described, "Et ventis et Julminis ocior alis;" and the
men of God, who came to David, "Men of might, and men of war fit for
battle, that could handle shield and buckeler," are said to have had
"faces like the faces of lions," and to have been "as swift as the roes
upon the mountains." [Ch1 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#008.md). Asahel
is described as "light of foot as a wild roe" ([Sa2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#018).md); and Saul seems called the roe
(in the English translation, "the beauty) of Israel." [Sa2
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#019.md). It has been said that the legs
of the hind are straighter than those of the buck, and that she is
swifter than he is; but there is no sufficient proof of this. Gataker
gives the true account of it when he says, "The female formula is often
used for the species." This is not uncommon in Hebrew. The female ass
obviously stands for the ass species. [Gen
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#016.md); [Job
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#003.md); [Job
42:12](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#012.md). Some (at the head of whom is
Bochart, Hierozoicon, P i. L. ii. 100:17), have supposed the reference
to be to the peculiar hardness of the hoof of the roe, which enables it
to walk firmly, without danger of falling, on the roughest and rockiest
places. Virgil calls the hind "aeri-pedem," brass-footed. Others suppose
the reference to be to its agility and celerity. There is nothing to
prevent our supposing that there is a reference to both these
distinguishing qualities of the hind's feet, John Brown.

[Psa 18:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#033.md)

"He maketh my feet like hinds' feet," etc. He maketh me able to stand on
the sides of mountains and rocks, which were anciently used as
fastnesses in time of war. The feet of the sheep, the goat, and the hart
are particularly adapted to standing in such places. Mr. Merrick has
here very appositely cited the following passage from Xenophon; Lib de
Venatione: Επισκοηετν δετ ἔχοντα τὰς κύνας τὰς μὲν ἐν ὂρεσι ἑοτῶσασ
̓λαφους. See also [Psa 104:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#018.md), where
the same property of standing on the rocks and steep cliffs is
attributed to the wild goat. - Stephen Street, M.A., in loc., 1790.

[Psa 18:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#034.md)

"He teacheth my hands to war," etc. To him I owe all that military
skill, or strength, or courage, which I have. MY strength is sufficient,
not only to bend "a bow of steel," but to break it. - Matthew Poole.

[Psa 18:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#034.md)

"Steel." The word so rendered in the authorised version, properly means
"copper" (גחוּשׁח). It is doubtful if the Hebrews were acquainted with
the process of hardening iron into steel, for though the "northern iron"
of [Jer 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#012.md), has been supposed by
some to be steel, this is by no means certain; it may have only been a
superior sort of iron. - William Lindsay Alexander, in "Kitto's
Cyclopaedia."

[Psa 18:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#034.md)

The drawing of a mighty bow was a mark of great slaughter and skill.

"So the great master drew the mighty bow,

And drew with ease. One hand aloft display'd.

The bending horns, and one the string essay'd."

Alexander Pope, 1688-1744. \[Translation of Homer\]

[Psa 18:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#037.md), [Psa
18:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#038.md)

Oh, I have seen the day,

When with a single word,

God helping me to say,

"My trust is in the Lord;"

My soul has quelled a thousand foes,

Fearless of all that could oppose.

William Cowper, 1731-1800.

[Psa 18:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#038.md)

"I have wounded them," etc. Greater is he that is in us than he that is
against us, and God shall bruise Satan under our feet shortly. [Rom
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#020.md). - W. Wilson.

[Psa 18:38-40](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#038.md)

Though passion possess our bodies, let "patience possess our souls." The
law of our profession binds us to a warfare; patiendo vincimus, our
troubles shall end, our victory is eternal. Hear David's triumph, "I
have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under
my feet. Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me. Thou
hast given me the necks of mine enemies," etc. They have wounds for
their wounds; and the treaders down of the poor are trodden down by the
poor. The Lord will subdue those to us that would have subdued us to
themselves; and though for a short time they rode over our heads, yet
now at last we shall everlastingly tread upon their necks. Lo, then, the
reward of humble patience and confident hope! - Thomas Adams.

[Psa 18:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#039.md)

To be well girt was to be well armed in the Greek and Latin idioms, as
well as in the Hebrew. - Alexander Geddes, LL.D., 1737-1802

[Psa 18:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#041.md)

"They shall cry, but there shall be none to help them," etc. Sad
examples enough there are of the truth of this prophecy. Of Esau it is
written that he "found no place of repentance, though he sought it
carefully with tears." [Heb 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#017.md). Of
Antiochus, though he vowed in his last illness, "that also he would
become a Jew himself, and go through all the world that was inhabited,
and declare the power of God, yet," continues the historian, "for all
this his pains would not cease, for the just Judgment of God was come
upon him." 2 Macc. 9:17, 18. But most appropriately to this passage, it
is written of Saul, "When he enquired of the Lord, the Lord answered him
not, neither by dreams nor by Urim, nor by prophets." [Sa1
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#006.md). And therefore, the prophet warns
us: "Give glory to the Lord your God, before he cause darkness, and
before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains ([Jer
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#016).md): as Saul's feet, indeed,
stumbled on the dark mountains of Gilboa. "Even unto the Lord shall they
cry:" but not, as it has been well remarked, by a Mediator: and so,
crying to him in their own name, and by their own merits, they cry in
vain. - John Lorinus (1569-1634), and Remigius (900), quoted by J. M.
Neale.

[Psa 18:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#041.md)

"Even unto the Lord." As nature prompteth men in an extremity to look up
for help; but because it is but the prayer of the flesh for ease, and
not of the Spirit for grace, and a good use of calamities, and not but
in extreme despair of help elsewhere, therefore God hears them not. In
Samuel it is, "They looked, but there was none to save them," q.d., If
they could have made any other shift, God should never have heard of
them. - John Trapp.

[Psa 18:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#042.md)

"I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets," or rather "of the
streets." In the East, all household refuse and filth is cast forth into
the streets, where all of it that is at all edible is soon cleared away
by birds and dogs, and all that is not is speedily dried up by the sun.
To cast forth any one, therefore, as the dirt of the streets, is a
strong image of contempt and rejection. - John Kitto.

[Psa 18:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#043.md), [Psa
18:44](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#044.md)

If these words can be explained literally of David, they apply much more
naturally to Jesus Christ, who has been delivered from the strivings of
the Jewish people; when, after the terrible opposition he met with on
their part, to the establishment of the gospel, he was made the head of
the Gentiles who were a strange people, and whom he had not formerly
acknowledged as his, but who nevertheless obeyed him with astonishing
readiness as soon as they heard his voice. - Louis Isaac le Matsire de
Stacy, 1613-1684.

[Psa 18:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#045.md)

The first clause is comparatively easy. "The strangers shall fade away"
- "shall gradually wither and disappear;" but the second clause is very
difficult, "They shall be afraid out of their close places." One Jewish
scholar interprets it, "They shall fear for the prisons in which I will
throw them and keep them confined." Another, "They shall tremble in
their castles to which they have betaken themselves for fear of me."
Another, "They shall surrender themselves from their fortresses." The
general meaning is plain enough. The class referred to are represented
as reduced to a state of complete helpless subjugation. As to the event
referred to, if we keep to the rendering of our translators the meaning
may be, "The Pagans, retired now generally to villages and remote
places, shall gradually dwindle away, and fearfully anticipate the
complete extinction of their religion." This exactly accords with
history. If with some interpreters we read, "The strangers shall fade
away, and be afraid because of their prisons," then the meaning may be,
"that they who only feigned submission, when persecution for the word
should arise should openly apostatise." This, too, would be found
consonant with fact. The first of these interpretations seems the more
probable. - John Brown.

[Psa 18:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#046.md)

"The Lord liveth: and blessed be my rock; and let the God of rail
salvation be exalted." - Let us unite our hearts in this Song for a
close of our praises. Honours die, pleasures die, the world dies; but
"The Lord liveth." My flesh is as sand; my fleshly life, strength,
glory, is as a word written on sand; but blessed be my Rock." Those are
for a moment; this stands for ever. The curse shall devour those;
everlasting blessings on the head of this. Let outward salvations
vanish; let the saved be crucified; let the "God" of our salvations "be
exalted." This Lord is my rock; this God is my salvation. - Peter
Sterry, 1649.

[Psa 18:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#046.md)

"The Lord liveth, "Why do you not oppose one God to all the armies of
evils that beset you round? why do you not take the more content in God
when you have the less of the creature to take content in? why do you
not boast in your God? and bear up yourselves big with your hopes in God
and expectations from him? Do you not see young heirs to great estates
act and spend accordingly? And, why shall you, being the King of
heaven's son, be lean and ragged from day to day, as though you were not
worth a great? O sirs, live upon your portion, chide yourselves for
living besides what you have. There are great and precious promises,
rich, enriching mercies; you may make use of God's all sufficiency; you
can blame none but yourselves if you be defective or discouraged. A
woman, truly godly for the main, having buried a child, and sitting
alone in sadness, did yet bear up her heart with the expression, "God
lives"; and having parted with another, still she redoubled, "Comforts
die, but God lives." At last her dear husband dies, and she sat
oppressed and most overwhelmed with sorrow. A little child she had yet
surviving, having observed what before she spoke to comfort herself,
comes to her and saith, "Is God dead, mother? is God dead?" This reached
her heart, and by God's blessing recovered her former confidence in her
God, who is a living God. Thus do you chide yourselves; ask your
fainting spirits under pressing outward sorrows, is not God alive? and
why then doth not thy soul revive? why doth thy heart die within thee
when comforts die! Cannot a living God support thy dying hopes? Thus,
Christians, argue down your discouraged and disquieted spirits as David
did. - Oliver Heywood's "Sure Mercies of David." 1672.

[Psa 18:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#047.md)

"It is God." Sir, this is none other than the hand of God; and to him
alone belongs the glory, wherein none are to share with him. The General
served you with all faithfulness and honour; and the best commendation I
can give him is that I dare say he attributes all to God, and would
rather perish than assume to himself." - Written to the Speaker of the
House of Commons, after the battle of Naseby, June 14, 1645, by Oliver
Cromwell.

[Psa 18:49](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#049.md)

I admire King David a great deal more when I see him in the quire than
when I see him in the camp; when I see him singing as the sweet singer
of Israel, than when I see him fighting as the worthy warrior of Israel.
For fighting with others he did overcome all others; but singing, and
delighting himself, he did overcome himself. - Thomas Playfere.

[Psalms 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 18:1</span></span>

1 I will love thee, O Lord, my strength.

2 The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my
strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my
salvation, and my high tower.

3 I will call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised so shall I be
saved from mine enemies.

[Psa 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#001.md)

"I will love thee, O Lord." With strong, hearty affection will I cling
to thee; as a child to its parent, or a spouse to her husband. The word
is intensely forcible, the love is of the deepest kind. "I will love
heartily, with my inmost bowels." Here is a fixed resolution to abide in
the nearest and most intimate union with the Most High. Our triune God
deserves the warmest love of all our hearts. Father, Son and Spirit have
each a claim upon our love. The solemn purpose never to cease loving
naturally springs from present fervour of affection. It is wrong to make
rash resolutions, but this when made in the strength of God is most wise
and fitting. "My strength." Our God is the strength of our life, our
graces, our works, our hopes, our conflicts, our victories. This verse
is not found in 1 Sam 22, and is a most precious addition, placed above
all and after all to form the pinnacle of the temple, the apex of the
pyramid. Love is still the crowning grace.

[Psa 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002.md)

"The Lord is my rock and my fortress." Dwelling among the crags and
mountain fastnesses of Judea, David had escaped the malice of Saul, and
here he compares his God to such a place of concealment and security.
Believers are often hidden in their God from the strife of tongues and
the fury of the storm of trouble. The clefts of the Rock of Ages are
safe abodes. "My deliverer," interposing in my hour of peril. When
almost captured the Lord's people are rescued from the hand of the
mighty by him who is mightier still. This title of "deliverer" has many
sermons in it, and is well worthy of the study of all experienced
saints. "My God;" this is all good things in one. There is a boundless
wealth in this expression; it means, my perpetual, unchanging, infinite,
eternal good. He who can say truly "my God," may well add, "my heaven,
my all." "My strength;" this word is really "my rock," in the sense of
strength and immobility. My sure, unchanging, eternal confidence and
support. Thus the word rock occurs twice, but it is no tautology, for
the first time it is a rock for concealment, but here a rock for
firmness and immutability. "In whom I will trust." Faith must be
exercised, or the preciousness of God is not truly known; and God must
be the object of faith, or faith is mere presumption. "My buckler,
warding off the blows of my enemy, shielding me from arrow or sword. The
Lord furnishes his warriors with weapons both offensive and defensive.
Our armoury is completely stored so that none need go to battle unarmed.
"The horn of my salvation," enabling me to push down my foes, and to
triumph over them with holy exultation. "My high tower," a citadel high
planted on a rocky eminence beyond the reach of my enemies, from the
heights of which I look down upon their fury without alarm, and survey a
wide landscape of mercy reaching even unto the goodly land beyond
Jordan. Here are many words, but none too many; we might profitably
examine each one of them had we leisure, but summing up the whole, we
may conclude with Calvin, that David here equips the faithful from head
to foot.

[Psa 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#003.md)

In this verse the happy poet resolves to invoke the Lord in joyful song,
believing that in all future conflicts his God would deal as well with
him as in the past. It is well to pray to God as to one who deserves to
be praised, for then we plead in a happy and confident manner. If I feel
that I can and do bless the Lord for all his past goodness, I am bold to
ask great things of him. That word So has much in it. To be saved
singing is to be saved indeed. Many are saved mourning and doubting; but
David had such faith that he could fight singing, and win the battle
with a song still upon his lips. How happy a thing to receive fresh
mercy with a heart already sensible of mercy enjoyed, and to anticipate
new trials with a confidence based upon past experiences of divine love!

"No fearing or doubting with Christ on our side,

We hope to die shouting, 'The Lord will provide.'"

[Psalms 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 18:4</span></span>

4 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made
me afraid.

5 The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented
me.

6 In my distress I called upon the Lord, and cried unto my God he heard
my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his
ears.

7 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills
moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.

8 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth
devoured: coals were kindled by it.

9 He bowed the heavens also, and came down and darkness was under his
feet.

10 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly yea, he did fly upon the wings
of the wind.

11 He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were
dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.

12 At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail
stones and coals of fire.

13 The Lord also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his
voice; hail stones and coals of fire.

14 Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out
lightnings, and discomfited them.

15 Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the
world were discovered at thy rebuke, O Lord, at the blast of the breath
of thy nostrils.

16 He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.

17 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me:
for they were too strong for me.

18 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the Lord was my
stay.

19 He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because
he delighted in me.

In most poetical language the Psalmist now describes his experience of
Jehovah's delivering power. Poesy has in all her treasures no gem more
lustrous than the sonnet of the following verses; the sorrow, the cry,
the descent of the Divine One, and the rescue of the afflicted, are here
set to a music worthy of the golden harps. The Messiah our Saviour is
evidently, over and beyond David or any other believer, the main and
chief subject of this song; and while studying it we have grown more and
more sure that every line here has its deepest and profoundest
fulfilment in Him; but as we are desirous not to extend our comment
beyond moderate bounds, we must leave it with the devout reader to make
the very easy application of the passage to our once distressed but now
triumphant Lord.

[Psa 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#004.md)

"The sorrows of death compassed me." Death like a cruel conqueror seemed
to twist round about him the cords of pain. He was environed and hemmed
in with threatening deaths of the most appalling sort. He was like a
mariner broken by the storm and driven upon the rocks by dreadful
breakers, white as the teeth of death. Sad plight for the man after
God's own heart, but thus it is that Jehovah dealeth with his sons. "The
floods of ungodly men made me afraid." Torrents of ungodliness
threatened to swamp all religion, and to hurry away the godly man's hope
as a thing to be scorned and despised; so far was this threat fulfilled,
that even the hero who slew Goliath began to be afraid. The most
seaworthy bark is sometimes hard put to it when the storm fiend is
abroad. The most courageous man, who as a rule hopes for the best, may
sometimes fear the worst. Beloved reader, he who pens these lines has
known better than most men what this verse means, and feels inclined to
weep, and yet to sing, while he writes upon a text so descriptive of his
own experience. On the night of the lamentable accident at the Surrey
Music Hall, the floods of Belial were let loose, and the subsequent
remarks of a large portion of the press were exceedingly malicious and
wicked; our soul was afraid as we stood encompassed with the sorrows of
death and the blasphemies of the cruel. But oh, what mercy was there in
it all, and what honey of goodness was extracted by our Lord out of this
lion of affliction! Surely God hath heard me! Art thou in an ill plight?
Dear friend, learn thou from our experience to trust in the Lord
Jehovah, who forsaketh not his chosen.

[Psa 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#005.md)

"The sorrows of hell compassed me about." From all sides the hell-hounds
barked furiously. A cordon of devils hemmed in the hunted man of God;
every way of escape was closed up. Satan knows how to blockade our
coasts with the iron war-ships of sorrow, but, blessed be God, the port
of all prayer is still open, and grace can run the blockade bearing
messages from earth to heaven, and blessings in return from heaven to
earth. "The snares of death prevented me." The old enemy hunts for his
prey, not only with the dogs of the infernal kennel, but also with the
snares of deadly craft. The nets were drawn closer and closer until the
contracted circle completely prevented the escape of the captive: -

About me cords of hell were wound,

And snares of death my footsteps bound."

Thus hopeless was the case of this good man, as hopeless as a case could
be, so utterly desperate that none but an almighty arm could be of any
service. According to the four metaphors which he employs, he was bound
like a malefactor for execution; overwhelmed like a shipwrecked mariner;
surrounded and standing at bay like a hunted stag; and captured in a net
like a trembling bird. What more of terror and distress could meet upon
one poor defenceless head?

[Psa 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#006.md)

"In my distress I called upon the Lord, and cried unto my God." Prayer
is that postern gate which is left open even when the city is straitly
besieged by the enemy; it is that way upward from the pit of despair to
which the spiritual miner flies at once when the floods from beneath
break forth upon him. Observe that he calls, and then cries; prayer
grows in vehemence as it proceeds. Note also that he first invokes his
God under the name of Jehovah, and then advances to a more familiar
name, "my God;" thus faith increases by exercise, and he whom we at
first viewed as Lord is soon seen to be our God in covenant. It is never
an ill time to pray; no distress should prevent us from using the divine
remedy of supplication. Above the noise of the raging billows of death,
or the barking dogs of hell, the feeblest cry of a true believer will be
heard in heaven. "He heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came
before him, even into his ears." Far up within the bejewelled walls, and
through the gates of pearl, the cry of the suffering suppliant was
heard. Music of angels and harmony of seraphs availed not to drown or
even to impair the voice of that humble call. The king heard it in his
palace of light unsufferable, and lent a willing ear to the cry of his
own beloved child. O honoured prayer, to be able thus through Jesus'
blood to penetrate the very ears and heart of Deity. The voice and the
cry are themselves heard directly by the Lord, and not made to pass
through the medium of saints and intercessors; "My cry came before Him;"
the operation of prayer with God is immediate and personal. We may cry
with confident and familiar importunity, while our Father himself
listens.

[Psa 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#007.md)

There was no great space between the cry and its answer. The Lord is not
slack concerning his promise, but is swift to rescue his afflicted.
David has in his mind's eye the glorious manifestations of God in Egypt,
at Sinai, and on different occasions to Joshua and the judges; and he
considers that his own case exhibits the same glory of power and
goodness, and that, therefore, he may accommodate the descriptions of
former displays of the divine majesty into this hymn of praise. "Then
the earth shook and trembled." Observe how the most solid and immovable
things feel the force of supplication. Prayer has shaken houses, opened
prison doors, and made stout hearts to quail. Prayer rings the alarm
bell, and the Master of the house arises to the rescue, shaking all
things beneath his tread. "The foundations also of the hills moved and
were shaken, because of his wrath." He who fixed the world's pillars can
make them rock in their sockets, and can upheave the cornerstones of
creation. The huge roots of the towering mountains are torn up when the
Lord bestirs himself in anger to smite the enemies of his people. How
shall puny man be able to face it out with God when the very mountains
quake with fear? Let not the boaster dream that his present false
confidence will support him in the dread day of wrath.

[Psa 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#008.md)

"There went up a smoke out of his nostrils." A violent oriental method
of expressing fierce wrath. Since the breath from the nostrils is heated
by strong emotion, the figure portrays the Almighty Deliverer as pouring
forth smoke in the heat of his wrath and the impetuousness of his zeal.
Nothing makes God so angry as an injury done to his children. He that
toucheth you toucheth the apple of mine eye. God is not subject to the
passions which govern his creatures, but acting as he does with all the
energy and speed of one who is angry, he is here aptly set forth in
poetic imagery suitable to human understandings. The opening of his lips
is sufficient to destroy his enemies; "and fire out of his mouth
devoured." This fire was no temporary one but steady and lasting; "Coals
were kindled by it." The whole passage is intended to depict God's
descent to the help of his child, attended by earthquake and tempest: at
the majesty of his appearing the earth rocks, the clouds gather like
smoke, and the lightning as flaming fire devours, setting the world on a
blaze. What grandeur of description is here! Bishop Mant very admirably
rhymes the verse thus: -

"Smoke from his heated nostrils came,

And from his mouth devouring flame;

Hot burning coals announced his ire,

And flashes of careering fire."

[Psa 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#009.md)

Amid the terror of the storm Jehovah the Avenger descended, bending
beneath his foot the arch of heaven. "He bowed the heavens also, and
came down." He came in haste, and spurned everything which impeded his
rapidity. The thickest gloom concealed his splendour, "and darkness was
under his feet;" he fought within the dense vapours, as a warrior in
clouds of smoke and dust, and found out the hearts of his enemies with
the sharp falchion of his vengeance. Darkness is no impediment to God;
its densest gloom he makes his tent and secret pavilion. See how prayer
moves earth and heaven, and raises storms to overthrow in a moment the
foes of God's Israel. Things were bad for David before he prayed, but
they were much worse for his foes so soon as the petition had gone .up
to heaven. A trustful heart, by enlisting the divine aid, turns the
tables on its enemies. If I must have an enemy let him not be a man of
prayer, or he will soon get the better of me by calling in his God into
the quarrel.

[Psa 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#010.md)

There is inimitable grandeur in this verse. Under the Mosaic system the
cherubim are frequently represented as the chariot of God; hence Milton,
in "Paradise Lost," writes of the Great Father, -

"He on the wings of cherubim

Uplifted, in paternal glory rode

Far into chaos."

Without speculating upon the mysterious and much-disputed subject of the
cherubim, it may be enough to remark that angels are doubtless our
guards and ministering friends, and all their powers are enlisted to
expedite the rescue of the afflicted. "He rode upon a cherub, and did
fly." Nature also yields all her agents to be our helpers, and even the
powers of the air are subservient: "yea, he did fly upon the wings of
the wind." The Lord comes flying when mercy is his errand, but he
lingers long when sinners are being wooed to repent. The flight here
pictured is as majestic as it is swift; "flying all abroad" is
Sternhold's word, and he is not far from correct. As the eagle soars in
easy grandeur with wings outspread, without violent flapping and
exertion, so comes the Lord with majesty of omnipotence to aid his own.

[Psa 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#011.md)

The storm thickened, and the clouds pouring forth torrents of rain
combined to form the secret chamber of the invisible but wonder-working
God. "Pavilioned in impervious shade" faith saw him, but no other eye
could gaze through the "thick clouds of the skies." Blessed is the
darkness which encurtains my God; if I may not see him, it is sweet to
know that he is working in secret for my eternal good. Even fools can
believe that God is abroad in the sunshine and the calm, but faith is
wise, and discerns him in the terrible darkness and threatening storm.

[Psa 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#012.md)

Suddenly the terrible artillery of heaven was discharged; the brightness
of lightning lit up the clouds as with a glory proceeding from him who
was concealed within the cloudy pavilion; and volleys of hailstones and
coals of fire were hurled forth upon the enemy. The lightnings seemed to
cleave the clouds and kindle them into a blaze, and then hailstones and
flakes of fire with flashes of terrific grandeur terrified the sons of
men.

[Psa 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#013.md)

Over all this splendour of tempest pealed the dread thunder. "The Lord
also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice." Fit
accompaniment for the flames of vengeance. How will men bear to hear it
at the last when addressed to them in proclamation of their doom, for
even now their hearts are in their mouths if they do but hear it
muttering from afar? In all this terror David found a theme for song,
and thus every believer finds even in the terrors of God a subject for
holy praise. "Hailstones and coals of fire" are twice mentioned to show
how certainly they are in the divine hand, and are the weapons of
Heaven's vengeance. Horne remarks that "every thunderstorm should remind
us of that exhibition of power and vengeance, which is hereafter to
accompany the general resurrection;" may it not also assure us of the
real power of him who is our Father and our friend, and tend to assure
us of our safety while he fights our battles for us. The prince of the
power of the air is soon dislodged when the cherubic chariot is driven
through his dominions; therefore let not the legions of hell cause us
dismay. He who is with us is greater than all they that be against us.

[Psa 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#014.md)

The lightnings were darted forth as forked arrows upon the hosts of the
foe, and speedily "scattered them." Boastful sinners prove to be great
cowards when Jehovah enter the lists with them. They despise his words,
and are very tongue-valiant, but when it comes to blows they fly apace.
The glittering flames, and the fierce bolts of fire "discomfited them."
God is never at a loss for weapons. Woe be unto him that contendeth with
his Maker! God's arrows never miss their aim; they are leathered with
lightning, and barbed with everlasting death. Fly, O sinner, to the rock
of refuge before these arrows stick fast in thy soul.

[Psa 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#015.md)

So tremendous was the shock of God's assault in arms that the order of
nature was changed, and the bottoms of rivers and seas were laid bare.
"The channels of waters were seen;" and the deep cavernous bowels of the
earth were upheaved till "the foundations of the world were discovered."
What will not Jehovah's "rebuke" do? If "the blast of the breath of thy
nostrils," O Lord, be so terrible, what must thine arm be? Vain are the
attempts of men to conceal anything from him whose word unbars the deep,
and lifts the doors of earth from their hinges! Vain are all hopes of
resistance, for a whisper of his voice makes the whole earth quail in
abject terror.

[Psa 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#016.md)

Now comes the rescue. The Author is divine, "He sent;" the work is
heavenly, "from above;" the deliverance is marvellous, "He drew me out
of many waters." Here David was like another Moses, drawn from the
water; and thus are all believers like their Lord, whose, baptism in
many waters of agony and in his own blood has redeemed us from the wrath
to come. Torrents of evil shall not drown the man whose God sitteth upon
the floods to restrain their fury.

[Psa 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#017.md)

When we have been rescued, we must take care to ascribe all the glory to
God by confessing our own weakness, and remembering the powers of the
conquered enemy. God's power derives honour from all the incidents of
the conflict. Our great spiritual adversary is a "strong enemy" indeed,
much too strong for poor, weak creatures like ourselves, but we have
been delivered hitherto and shall be even to the end. Our weakness is a
reason for divine help; mark the force of the "for" in the text.

[Psa 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#018.md)

It was an ill day, a day of calamity, of which evil foes took cruel
advantage while they used crafty means utterly to ruin him, yet David
could say, "but the Lord is my stay." What a blessed but which cuts the
Gordian knot, and slays the hundred-headed hydra! There is no fear of
deliverance when our stay is in Jehovah.

[Psa 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#019.md)

"He brought me forth also into a large place." After pining awhile in
the prison-house Joseph reached the palace, and from the cave of Adullam
David mounted to the throne. Sweet is pleasure after pain. Enlargement
is the more delightful after a season of pinching poverty and sorrowful
confinement. Besieged souls delight in the broad fields of the promise
when God drives off the enemy and sets open the gates of the environed
city. The Lord does not leave his work half done, for having routed the
foe he leads out the captive into liberty. Large indeed is the
possession and place of the believer in Jesus, there need be no limit to
his peace, for there is no bound to his privilege. "He delivered me,
because he delighted in me." Free grace lies at the foundation. Rest
assured, if we go deep enough, sovereign grace is the truth which lies
at the bottom of every well of mercy. Deep sea fisheries in the ocean of
divine bounty always bring the pearls of electing, discriminating love
to light. Why Jehovah should delight in us is an answerless question,
and a mystery which angels cannot solve; but that he does delight in his
beloved is certain, and is the fruitful root of favours as numerous as
they are precious. Believer, sit down, and inwardly digest the
instructive sentence now before us, and learn to view the uncaused love
of God as the cause of all the loving-kindness of which we are the
partakers.

[Psalms 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 18:20</span></span>

20 The Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the
cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.

21 For I have kept the ways of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed
from my God.

22 For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his
statutes from me.

23 I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.

24 Therefore hath the Lord recompensed me according to my righteousness,
according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.

25 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright
man thou wilt shew thyself upright;

26 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou
wilt shew thyself froward.

27 For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high
looks.

28 For thou wilt light my candle: the Lord my God will enlighten my
darkness.

[Psa 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#020.md)

"The Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness." Viewing this Psalm
as prophetical of the Messiah, these strongly-expressed claims to
righteousness are readily understood, for his garments were white as
snow; but considered as the language of David they have perplexed many.
Yet the case is clear, and if the words be not strained beyond their
original intention, no difficulty need occur. Albeit that the
dispensations of divine grace are to the fullest degree Sovereign and
irrespective of human merit, yet in the dealings of Providence there is
often discernible a rule of justice by which the injured are at length
avenged, and the righteous ultimately delivered. David's early troubles
arose from the wicked malice of envious Saul, who no doubt prosecuted
his persecutions under cover of charges brought against the character of
"the man after God's own heart." These charges David declares to have
been utterly false, and asserts that he possessed a grace-given
righteousness which the Lord had graciously rewarded in defiance of all
his calumniators. Before God the man after God's own heart was a humble
sinner, but before his slanderers he could with unblushing face speak of
the "cleanness of his hands" and the righteousness of his life. He knows
little of the sanctifying power of divine grace who is not at the bar of
human equity able to plead innocence. There is no self-righteousness in
an honest man knowing that he is honest, nor even in his believing that
God rewards him in providence because of his honesty, for such is often
a most evident matter of fact; but it would be self-righteousness indeed
if we transferred such thoughts from the region of providential
government into the spiritual kingdom, for there grace reigns not only
supreme but sole in the distribution of divine favours. It is not at all
an opposition to the doctrine of salvation by grace, and no sort of
evidence of a Pharisaic spirit, when a gracious man, having been
slandered, stoutly maintains his integrity, and vigorously defends his
character. A godly man has a clear conscience, and knows himself to be
upright; is he to deny his own consciousness, and to despise the work of
the Holy Ghost, by hypocritically making himself out to be worse than he
is? A godly man prizes his integrity very highly, or else he would not
be a godly man at all; is he to be called proud because he will not
readily lose the jewel of a reputable character? A godly man can see
that in divine providence uprightness and truth are in the long run sure
to bring their own reward; may he not, when he sees that reward bestowed
in his own case, praise the Lord for it? Yea rather, must he not show
forth the faithfulness and goodness of his God? Read the cluster of
expressions in this and the following verses as the song of a good
conscience, after having safely outridden a storm of obloquy,
persecution, and abuse, and there will be no fear of our upbraiding the
writer as one who set too high a price upon his own moral character.

[Psa 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#021.md)

Here the assertion of purity is repeated, both in a positive and a
negative form. There is "I have" and "I have not," both of which must be
blended in a truly sanctified life; constraining and restraining grace
must each take its share. The words of this verse refer to the saint as
a traveller carefully keeping to "the ways of the Lord," and "not
wickedly," that is, designedly, wilfully, persistently, defiantly
forsaking the ordained pathway in which God favours the pilgrim with his
presence. Observe how it is implied in the expression "and have not
wickedly departed from my God," that David lived habitually in communion
with God, and knew him to be his own God, whom he might speak of as "my
God." God never departs from his people, let them take heed of departing
from him.

[Psa 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#022.md)

"For all his judgments were before me." The word, the character, and the
actions of God should be evermore before our eyes; we should learn,
consider, and reverence them. Men forget what they do not wish to
remember, but the excellent attributes of the Most High are objects of
the believer's affectionate and delighted admiration. We should keep the
image of God so constantly before us that we become in our measure
conformed unto it. This inner love to the right must be the main spring
of Christian integrity in our public walk. The fountain must be filled
with love to holiness and then the streams which issue from it will be
pure and gracious. "I did not put away his statutes from me." To put
away the Scriptures from the mind's study is the certain way to prevent
their influencing the outward conversation. Backsliders begin with dusty
Bibles, and go on to filthy garments.

[Psa 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#023.md)

"I was also upright before him." Sincerity is here claimed; sincerity,
such as would be accounted genuine before the bar of God. Whatever evil
men might think of Him, David felt that he had the good opinion of his
God. Moreover, freedom from his one great besetting sin he ventures also
to plead, "I kept myself from mine iniquity." It is a very gracious sign
when the most violent parts of our nature have been well guarded. If the
weakest link in the chain is not broken, the stronger links will be safe
enough. David's impetuous temper might have led him to slay Saul when he
had him in his power, but grace enabled him to keep his hands clean of
the blood of his enemy; but what a wonder it was, and how well worthy of
such a grateful record as these verses afford! It will be a sweet
cordial to us one of these days to remember our self-denials, and to
bless God that we were able to exhibit them.

[Psa 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#024.md)

God first gives us holiness, and then rewards us for it. We are his
workmanship; vessels made unto honour; and when made, the honour is not
withheld from the vessel; though, in fact, it all belongs to the Potter
upon whose wheel the vessel was fashioned. The prize is awarded to the
flower at the show, but the gardener reared it; the child wins the prize
from the schoolmaster, but the real honour of his schooling lies with
his master, although instead of receiving he gives the reward.

[Psa 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#025.md)

The dealings of the Lord in his own case, cause the grateful singer to
remember the usual rule of God's moral government; he is just in his
dealings with the sons of men, and metes out to each man according to
his measure. "With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an
upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright." Every man shall have his
meat weighed in his own scales, his corn meted in his own bushel, and
his land measured with his own rod. No rule can be more fair, to ungodly
men more terrible, or to the generous more honourable. How would men
throw away their light weights, and break their short yards, if they
could but believe that they themselves are sure to be in the end the
losers by their knavish tricks? Note that even the merciful need mercy;
no amount of generosity to the poor, or forgiveness to enemies, can set
us beyond the need of mercy. Lord, have mercy upon me, a sinner.

[Psa 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#026.md)

"With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou
wilt shew thyself froward." The sinner's frowardness is sinful and
rebellious, and the only sense in which the term can be applied to the
Most Holy God is that of judicial opposition and sternness, in which the
Judge of all the earth will act at cross-purposes with the offender, and
let him see that all things are not to be made subservient to wicked
whims and wilful fancies. Calvin very forcibly says, "This brutish and
monstrous stupidity in men compels God to invent new modes of
expression, and as it were to clothe himself with a different character.
There is a similar sentence in [Lev
26:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#021.md), where God says, "and if ye
walk contrary unto (or perversely with) me, then will I also walk
contrary unto (or perversely, or roughly, or at random with) you." As if
he had said that their obstinacy and stubbornness would make him on his
part forget his accustomed forbearance and gentleness, and cast himself
recklessly or at random against them. We see then what the stubborn at
length gain by their obduracy; it is this, that God hardens himself
still more to break them in pieces, and if they are of stone, he causes
them to feel that he has the hardness of iron. The Jewish tradition was
that the manna tasted according to each man's mouth; certainly God shows
himself to each individual according to his character.

[Psa 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#027.md)

"For thou wilt save the afflicted people." This is a comforting
assurance for the poor in spirit whose spiritual griefs admit of no
sufficient solace from any other than a divine hand. They cannot save
themselves nor can others do it, but God will save them. "But wilt bring
down high looks." Those who look down on others with scorn shall be
looked down upon with contempt ere long. The Lord abhors a proud look.
What a reason for repentance and humiliation! How much better to be
humble than to provoke God to humble us in his wrath! A considerable
number of clauses occur in this passage in the future tense; how
forcibly are we thus brought to remember that our present joy or sorrow
is not to have so much weight with us as the great and eternal future!

[Psa 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#028.md)

"For thou wilt light my candle." Even the children of the day sometimes
need candle light. In the darkest hour light will arise; a candle shall
be lit, it will be comfort such as we may fittingly use without
dishonesty - it will be our own candle; yet God himself will find the
holy fire with which the candle shall burn; our evidences are our own,
but their comfortable light is from above. Candles which are lit by God
the devil cannot blow out. All candles are not shining, and so there are
some graces which yield no present comfort; but it is well to have
candles which may by and by be lit, and it is well to possess graces
which may yet afford us cheering evidences. The metaphor of the whole
verse is founded upon the dolorous nature of darkness and the
delightfulness of light; "truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing
it is for the eyes to behold the sun;" and even so the presence of the
Lord removes all the gloom of sorrow, and enables the believer to
rejoice with exceeding great joy. The lighting of the lamp is a cheerful
moment in the winter's evening, but the lifting up of the light of God's
countenance is happier far. It is said that the poor in Egypt will stint
themselves of bread to buy oil for the lamp, so that they may not sit in
darkness; we could well afford to part with all earthly comforts if the
light of God's love could but constantly gladden our souls.

[Psalms 18:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">psa 18:29</span></span>

29 For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped
over a wall.

30 As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the Lord is tried: he is
a buckler to all those that trust in him.

31 For who is God save the Lord? or who is a rock save our God?

32 It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.

33 He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high
places.

34 He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine
arms.

35 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right
hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.

36 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.

37 I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn
again till they were consumed.

38 I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen
under my feet.

39 For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast
subdued under me those that rose up against me.

40 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might
destroy them that hate me.

41 They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the Lord, but
he answered them not.

42 Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast
them out as the dirt in the streets.

43 Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou
hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known
shall serve me.

44 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall
submit themselves unto me.

45 The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close
places.

Some repetitions are not vain repetitions. Second thoughts upon God's
mercy should be and often are the best. Like wines on the lees our
gratitude grows stronger and sweeter as we meditate upon divine
goodness. The verses which we have now to consider are the ripe fruit of
a thankful spirit; they are apples of gold as to matter, and they are
placed in baskets of silver as to their language. They describe the
believer's victorious career and his enemies' confusion.

[Psa 18:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#029.md)

"For by thee I have run through a troop: and by my God have I leaped
over a wall." Whether we meet the foe in the open field or leap upon
them while they lurk behind the battlements of a city, we shall by God's
grace defeat them in either case; if they hem us in with living legions,
or environ us with stone walls, we shall with equal certainty obtain our
liberty. Such feats we have already performed, hewing our way at a run
through hosts of difficulties, and scaling impossibilities at a leap.
God's warriors may expect to have a taste of every form of fighting, and
must by the power of faith determine to quit themselves like men; but it
behoves them to be very careful to lay all their laurels at Jehovah's
feet, each one of them saying, "by my God" have I wrought this valiant
deed. Our spolia optima, the trophies of our conflicts, we hereby
dedicate to the God of Battles, and ascribe to him all glory and
strength.

[Psa 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#030.md)

"As for God, his way is perfect." Far past all fault and error are God's
dealings with his people; all his actions are resplendent with justice,
truth, tenderness, mercy, and holiness. Every way of God is complete in
itself, and all his ways put together are matchless in harmony and
goodness. Is it not very consolatory to believe that he who has begun to
bless us will perfect his work, for all his ways are "perfect?" Nor must
the divine "word" be without its song of praise. "The word of the Lord
is tried," like silver refined in the furnace. The doctrines are
glorious, the precepts are pure, the promises are faithful, and the
whole revelation is superlatively full of grace and truth. David had
tried it, thousands have tried it, we have tried it, and it has never
failed. It was meet that when way and word had been extolled, the Lord
himself should be magnified; hence it is added, "He is a buckler to all
those that trust in him." No armour of proof or shield of brass so well
secures the warrior as the covenant God of Israel protects his warring
people. He himself is the buckler of trustful ones; what a thought is
this! What peace may every trusting soul enjoy!

[Psa 18:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#031.md)

Having mentioned his God, the Psalmist's heart burns, and his words
sparkle; he challenges heaven and earth to find another being worthy of
adoration or trust in comparison with Jehovah. His God, as Matthew Henry
says, is a None-such. The idols of the heathen he scorns to mention,
snuffing them all out as mere nothings when Deity is spoken of. "Who is
God save the Lord?" Who else creates, sustains, foresees, and overrules?
Who but he is perfect in every attribute, and glorious in every act? To
whom but Jehovah should creatures bow? Who else can claim their service
and their love? "Who is a rock save our God?" Where can lasting hopes be
fixed? Where can the soul find rest? Where is stability to be found?
Where is strength to be discovered? Surely in the Lord Jehovah alone can
we find rest and refuge.

[Psa 18:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#032.md)

Surveying all the armour in which he fought and conquered, the joyful
victor praises the Lord for every part of the panoply. The girdle of his
loins earns the first stanza: "It is God that girdeth me with strength,
and maketh my wall perfect." Girt about the loins with power from
heaven, the warrior was filled with vigour, far above all created might;
and, whereas, without this wonderous belt he would have been feeble and
effeminate, with relaxed energies and scattered forces, he felt himself,
when braced with the girdle of truth, to be compact in purpose,
courageous in daring, and concentrated in power; so that his course was
a complete success, so undisturbed by disastrous defeat as to be called
"perfect." Have we been made more than conquerors over sin, and has our
life hitherto been such as becometh the gospel? Then let us ascribe all
the glory to him who girt us with his own inexhaustible strength, that
we might be unconquered in battle and unwearied in pilgrimage.

[Psa 18:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#033.md)

The conqueror's feet had been shod by a divine hand, and the next note
must, therefore, refer to them. "He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and
setteth me upon my high places." Pursuing his foes the warrior had been
swift of foot as a young roe, but, instead of taking pleasure in the
legs of a man, he ascribes the boon of swiftness to the Lord alone. When
our thoughts are nimble, and our spirits rapid, like the chariots of
Amminadib, let us not forget that our best Beloved's hand has given us
the choice favour. Climbing into impregnable fortresses, David had been
preserved from slipping, and made to stand where scarce the wild goat
can find a footing; herein was preserving mercy manifested. We, too,
have had our high places of honour, service, temptation, and danger, but
hitherto we have been kept from falling. Bring hither the harp, and let
us emulate the Psalmist's joyful thanksgiving; had we fallen, our
wailings must have been terrible; since we have stood, let our gratitude
be fervent.

[Psa 18:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#034.md)

"He teacheth my hands to war." Martial prowess and skill in the use of
weapons are gratefully acknowledged to be the result of divine teaching;
no sacrifice is offered at the shrine of self in praise of natural
dexterity, or acquired skilfulness; but, regarding all warlike prowess
as a gift of heavenly favour, thankfulness is presented to the Giver.
The Holy Spirit is the great Drill-master of heavenly soldiers. "So that
a bow of steel is broken by mine arms." A bow of brass is probably
meant, and these bows could scarcely be bent by the arms alone, the
archer had to gain the assistance of his foot; it was, therefore, a
great feat of strength to bend the bow, so far as even to snap it in
halves. This was meant of the enemies' bow, which he not only snatched
from his grasp, but rendered useless by breaking it in pieces. Jesus not
only destroyed the fiery suggestions of Satan, but he broke his
arguments with which he shot them, by using Holy Scripture against him;
by the same means we may win a like triumph, breaking the bow and
cutting the spear in sunder by the sharp edge of revealed truth.
Probably David had by nature a vigorous bodily frame; but it is even
more likely that, like Samson, he was at times clothed with more than
common strength; at any rate, he ascribes the honour of his feats
entirely to his God. Let us never wickedly rob the Lord of his due, but
faithfully give unto him the glory which is due unto his name.

[Psa 18:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#035.md)

"Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation." Above all we must
take the shield of faith, for nothing else can quench Satan's fiery
darts; this shield is of celestial workmanship, and is in all cases a
direct gift from God himself; it is the channel, the sign, the
guarantee, and the earnest of perfect salvation. "Thy right hand hath
holden me up." Secret support is administered to us by the preserving
grace of God, and at the same time Providence kindly yields us manifest
aid. We are such babes that we cannot stand alone; but when the Lord's
right hand upholds us, we are like brazen pillars which cannot be moved.
"Thy gentleness hath made me great." There are several readings of this
sentence. The word is capable of being translated, "thy goodness hath
made me great." David saw much of benevolence in God's action towards
him, and he gratefully ascribed all his greatness not to his own
goodness, but to the goodness of God. "Thy providence" is another
reading, which is indeed nothing more than goodness in action. Goodness
is the bud of which providence is the flower; or goodness is the seed of
which providence is the harvest. Some render it, "thy help," which is
but another word for providence; providence being the firm ally of the
saints, aiding them in the service of their Lord. Certain learned
annotators tell us that the text means, "thy humility hath made me
great." "Thy condescension" may, perhaps, serve as a comprehensive
reading, combining the ideas which he have already mentioned, as well as
that of humility. It is God's making himself little which is the cause
of our being made great. We are so little that if God should manifest
his greatness without condescension, we should be trampled under his
feet; but God, who must stoop to view the skies and bow to see what
angels do, looks to the lowly and contrite, and makes them great. While
these are the translations which have been given to the adopted text of
the original, we find that there are other readings altogether; as for
instance, the Septuagint, which reads, "thy discipline" - thy fatherly
correction - "hath made me great;" while the Chaldee paraphrase reads,
"thy word hath increased me." Still the idea is the same. David ascribes
all his own greatness to the condescending goodness and graciousness of
his Father in heaven. Let us all feel this sentiment in our own hearts,
and confess that whatever of goodness or greatness God may have put upon
us, we must cast our crowns at his feet, and cry, "thy gentleness hath
made me great."

[Psa 18:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#036.md)

"Thou hast enlarged my steps." A smooth pathway leading to spacious
possessions and camping-grounds had been opened up for him. Instead of
threading the narrow mountain paths, and hiding in the cracks and
corners of caverns, he was able to traverse the plains and dwell under
his own vine and fig tree. It is no small mercy to be brought into full
Christian liberty and enlargement, but it is a greater favour still to
be enabled to walk worthily in such liberty, not being permitted to slip
with our feet. To stand upon the rocks of affliction is the result of
gracious upholding, but that aid is quite as much needed in the
luxurious plains of prosperity.

[Psa 18:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#037.md)

The preservation of the saints bodes ill for their adversaries. The
Amalekites thought themselves clear away with their booty, but when
David's God guided him in the pursuit, they were soon overtaken and cut
in pieces. When God is with us sins and sorrows flee, and all form of
evil are "consumed" before the power of grace. What a noble picture this
and the following verses present to us of the victories of our glorious
Lord Jesus!

[Psa 18:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#038.md)

The destruction of our spiritual enemies is complete. We may exult over
sin, death and hell, as disarmed and disabled for us by our conquering
Lord; may he graciously give them a like defeat within us.

[Psa 18:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#039.md)

It is impossible to be too frequent in the duty of ascribing all our
victories to the God of our salvation. It is true that we have to
wrestle with our spiritual antagonists, but the triumph is far more the
Lord's than ours. We must not boast like the ambitious rotaries of
vainglory, but we may exult as the willing and believing instruments in
the Lord's hands of accomplishing his great designs.

[Psa 18:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#041.md)

"They cried, but there was none to save them; even unto the Lord, but he
answered them not." Prayer is so notable a weapon that even the wicked
will take to it in their fits of desperation. Bad men have appealed to
God against God's own servants, but all in vain; the kingdom of heaven
is not divided, and God never succours his foes at the expense of his
friends. There are prayers to God which are no better than blasphemy,
which bring no comfortable reply, but rather provoke the Lord to greater
wrath. Shall I ask a man to wound or slay his own child to gratify my
malice? Would he not resent the insult against his humanity? How much
less will Jehovah regard the cruel desires of the enemies of the church,
who dare to offer their prayers for its destruction calling its
existence schism, and its doctrine heresy!

[Psa 18:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#042.md)

The defeat of the nations who fought with King David was so utter and
complete that they were like powders pounded in a mortar; their power
was broken into fragments and they became as weak as dust before the
wind, and as mean as the mire of the roads. Thus powerless and base are
the enemies of God now become through the victory of the Son of David
upon the cross. Arise, O my soul, and meet thine enemies, for they have
sustained a deadly blow, and will fall before thy bold advance.

"Hell and my sins resist my course,

But hell and sin are vanquish'd foes;

My Jesus nail'd them to his cross,

And sung the triumph when he rose."

[Psa 18:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#043.md)

"Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people." Internal
strife is very hard to deal with. A civil war is war in its most
miserable form; it is a subject for warmest gratitude when concord rules
within. Our poet praises Jehovah for the union and peace which smiled in
his dominions, and if we have peace in the three kingdoms of our spirit,
soul, and body, we are in duty bound to give Jehovah a song unity in a
church should assuredly excite like gratitude. "Thou hast made me the
head of the heathen; a people whom I have not known shall serve me." The
neighbouring nations yielded to the sway of Judah's prince. Oh when
shall all lands adore King Jesus, and serve him with holy joy? Surely
there is far more of Jesus than of David here. Missionaries may derive
rich encouragement from the positive declaration that heathen lands
shall own the Headship of the Crucified.

[Psa 18:44](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#044.md)

"As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me." Thus readily did the
once struggling captain become a far-renowned victor, and thus easy
shall be our triumphs. We prefer, however, to speak of Jesus. In many
cases the gospel is speedily received by hearts apparently unprepared
for it. Those who have never heard the gospel before, have been charmed
by its first message, and yielded obedience to it; while others, alas!
who are accustomed to its joyful sound, are rather hardened than
softened by its teachings. The grace of God sometimes runs like fire
among the stubble, and a nation is born in a day. "Love at first sight"
is no uncommon thing when Jesus is the wooer. He can write Caesar's
message without boasting, Veni, vidi, vici; his gospel is in some cases
no sooner heard than believed. What inducements to spread abroad the
doctrine of the cross!

[Psa 18:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#045.md)

"The strangers shall fade away." Like sear leaves or blasted trees our
foes and Christ's foes shall find no sap and stamina remaining in them.
Those who are strangers to Jesus are strangers to all lasting happiness;
those must soon fade who refuse to be watered from the river of life.
"And be afraid out of their close places." Out of their mountain
fastnesses the heathen crept in fear to own allegiance to Israel's king,
and even so, from the castles of self-confidence and the dens of carnal
security, poor sinners come bending before the Saviour, Christ the Lord.
Our sins which have entrenched themselves in our flesh and blood as in
impregnable forts, shall yet be driven forth by the sanctifying energy
of the Holy Spirit, and we shall serve the Lord in singleness of heart.
Thus with remembrances of conquests in the past, and with glad
anticipations of victories yet to come the sweet singer closes the
description, and returns to exercise of more direct adoration of his
gracious God.

[Psalms 18:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">psa 18:46</span></span>

46 The Lord liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my
salvation be exalted.

47 It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.

48 He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above
those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent
man.

49 Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the heathen,
and sing praises unto thy name.

50 Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his
anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.

[Psa 18:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#046.md)

"The Lord liveth." Possessing underived, essential, Independent and
eternal life. We serve no inanimate, imaginary, or dying God. He only
hath immortality. Like loyal subjects let us cry, Live on, O God. Long
live the King of kings. By thine immortality do we dedicate ourselves
afresh to thee. As the Lord our God liveth so would we live to him. "And
blessed be my rock." He is the ground of our hope, and let him be the
subject of our praise. Our hearts bless the Lord, with holy love
extolling him.

Jehovah lives, my rock be blest!

Praised be the God who gives me rest!

"Let the God of my salvation be exalted." As our Saviour, the Lord
should more than ever be glorified. We should publish abroad the story
of the covenant and the cross, the Father's election, the Son's
redemption, and the Spirit's regeneration. He who rescues us from
deserved ruin should be very dear to us. In heaven they sing, "Unto him
that loved us and washed us in his blood;" the like music should be
common in the assemblies of the saints below.

[Psa 18:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#047.md)

"It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me." To
rejoice in personal revenge is unhallowed and evil, but David viewed
himself as the instrument of vengeance upon the enemies of God and his
people, and had he not rejoiced in the success accorded to him he would
have been worthy of censure. That sinners perish is in itself a painful
consideration, but that the Lord's law is avenged upon those who break
it is to the devout mind a theme for thankfulness. We must, however,
always remember that vengeance is never ours, vengeance belongeth unto
the Lord, and he is so just and withal so long-suffering in the
excercise of it, that we may safely leave its administration in his
hands.

[Psa 18:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#048.md)

From all enemies, and especially from one who was pre-eminent in
violence, the Lord's anointed was preserved, and at the last over the
head of Saul and all other adversaries he reigned in honour. The like
end awaits every saint, because Jesus who stooped to be lightly esteemed
among men is now made to sit far above all principalities and powers.

[Psa 18:49](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#049.md)

Paul cites this verse ([Rom 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#009).md):
"And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is
written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and
sing unto thy name." This is clear evidence that David's Lord is here,
but David is here too; and is to be viewed as an example of a holy soul
making its boast in God even in the presence of ungodly men. Who are the
despisers of God that we should stop our mouths for them? We will sing
to our God whether they like it or no, and force upon them the knowledge
of his goodness. Too much politeness to traitors may be treason to our
King.

[Psa 18:50](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#050.md)

This is the winding-up verse into which the writer throws a fulness of
expression, indicating the most rapturous delight of gratitude. "Great
deliverance." The word "deliverance" is plural, to show the variety and
completeness of the salvation; the adjective "great" is well placed if
we consider from what, to what, and how we are saved. All this mercy is
given to us in our King, the Lord's Anointed, and those are blessed
indeed who as his seed may expect mercy to be built up for evermore. The
Lord was faithful to the literal David, and he will not break his
covenant with the spiritual David, for that would far more involve the
honour of his crown and character.

The Psalm concludes in the same loving spirit which shone upon its
commencement; happy are they who can sing on from love to love, even as
the pilgrims marched from strength to strength.
