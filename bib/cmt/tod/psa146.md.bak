### [Psalms Chapter 146](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 146:0</span></span>

Division, Etc. - We are now among the Hallelujahs. The rest of our
journey lies through the Delectable Mountains. All is praise to the
close of the book. The key is high-pitched: the music is upon the
high-sounding cymbals. O for a heart full of joyful gratitude, that we
may run, and leap, and glorify God, even as these Psalms do.

Alexander thinks that this song may be regarded as composed of two equal
parts; in the first we see the happiness of those who trust in God, and
not in man ([Psa 146:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#001).md), while the
second gives the reason drawn from the Divine perfections ([Psa
146:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#005).md). This might suffice for our
purpose; but as there is really no break at all, we will keep it entire.
It is "one pearl," a sacred censer of holy incense, pouring forth one
sweet perfume.

Hints to Preachers

[Psa 146:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#001.md). -

I. An exhortation: it is addressed to ourselves: "Praise ye the Lord."

II\. An example: the Psalmist cries to himself, "Praise the Lord."

III\. An echo: "Praise the Lord, O my soul." Let us say this to our own
souls.

[Psa 146:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#001.md). - Whom should I praise?
And why? And when? And how?

[Psa 146:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#001.md). - Public worship.

I. Should be with a sense of fellowship: "Praise ye": pleasures of
communion in praise.

II\. Should never lose its individuality:: "O my soul." God is only
praised by individual hearts. Temptations to wandering in public
services.

III\. Should be full of Jehovah's felt presence: each and all should
worship him alone. - W. B. H.

[Psa 146:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#002.md). - Work for here and
hereafter.

I. "While I live"; or a period of uncertainty and mystery.

II\. "I will praise the Lord"; or a service definite, determined, due,
and delightful. Certainty amid uncertainty.

III\. "While I have any being"; or an enthusiastic pre-engagement of
eternity. - W. B. H.

[Psa 146:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#003.md). -

I. It dishonours God.

II\. It degrades you.

III\. It disappoints in every case.

[Psa 146:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#004.md). - Decease, Decay, Defeat.

[Psa 146:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#004) (second clause.md). - The
failure of man's projects, the disappearance of his philosophies, the
disproving of his boastings.

[Psa 146:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#005.md). - The secret of true
happiness.

I. What it is not. The man here mentioned has his work and warfare, for
he needs help; and he has not all he desires, for he is a man of hope.

II\. What it is. It lies in the hath, the help, and the hope, and these
are all in God.

[Psa 146:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#006.md), [Psa
146:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#007.md). - The God of our hope is,

I. Creator.

II\. Truth-keeper.

III\. Vindicator.

IV\. Provider.

V. Deliverer.

[Psa 146:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#007) (last clause.md). - See
"Spurgeon's Sermons," No. 484: "The Lord - the Liberator."

[Psa 146:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#007.md). - The People's Rights.

I. Three rights of humanity. Justice, Bread, Freedom.

II\. God's interventions in their behalf. Revolutions, Reforms,
Regenerations. Christ's war with Satan.

III\. The magnificent supply of the three blessings in Christ's kingdom.

IV\. The men who are fashioned and trained under this regime. - W. B. H.

[Psa 146:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#008) (first clause.md). - Spiritual
blindness, its curse, cause, and cure.

[Psa 146:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#008) (second clause.md). - Who are
the people? Who raises them? How he does it. And what then?

[Psa 146:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#008) (third clause.md). - God's
love to the righteous.

I. He made them righteous.

II\. They are like him.

III\. They love him.

IV\. Their purposes are one with his own.

[Psa 146:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#009.md). - Observe the provision
made in the Jewish law for the stranger. The way in which strangers were
received by God. The truth that his chosen are strangers in the world.
His design to gather in strangers in the latter days.

[Psa 146:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#009) (centre clause.md). - The

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings,

Psalms 146-148

At the dedication of the second Temple, in the beginning of the seventh
year of Darius, Psalms 147, [Psa
146:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#001.md) and [Psa
148:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#001.md), seem to have been sung; for
in the Septuagint Version they are styled the Psalms of Haggai and
Zechariah, as if they had been composed by them for this occasion. This,
no doubt, was from some ancient tradition; but in the original Hebrew
these Psalms have no such title prefixed to them, neither have they any
other to contradict it. - Humphrey Prideaux.

Psalms 146-150

We do not know who put together these different sacred compositions, or
whether they were arranged on any particular principle. This, however,
is obvious, - that the last series, those that close the whole, are full
of praise. Though we meet frequently with grief and shame and tears in
the former part, a great deal that presses upon the spirit, - and in the
centre a great many references to the various vicissitudes and fortunes
through which the church or the individual has passed, - yet, as we get
towards the end, and as the book closes, it is Hallelujah - praise. As
the ancient church ceases to speak to us, as she lays down her lyre, and
ceases to touch it, the last tones are tones of heaven; as if the
warfare were done, the conflict accomplished, and she were anticipating
either the revelations which are to make her glorious here, the "new
thing" which God is about to "create" when he places her under another
dispensation, or as you and I (I trust) shall do when we come to die,
anticipating the praise and occupation of that eternity and rest for
which we hope in the bosom of God. - Thomas Binney, 1798-1874.

Whole Psalm

This Psalm gives in brief the Gospel of Confidence.: It inculcates the
elements of Faith, Hope, and Thanksgiving. - Martin Geier.

[Psa 146:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#001.md)

"Praise ye the Lord." The word here used is Alleluia, and this is very
proper to be constantly used by us who are dependent creatures, and
under such great obligations to the Father of mercies. We have often
heard of prayer doing great wonders; but instances also are not wanting
of praise being accompanied with signal events. The ancient Britons, in
the year 420, obtained a victory over the army of the Picts and Saxons,
near Mold, in Flintshire, The Britons, unarmed, having Germanicus and
Lupus at their head, when the Picts and Saxons came to the attack, the
two commanders, Gideon-like, ordered their little army to shout Alleluia
three times over, at the sound of which the enemy, being suddenly struck
with terror, ran away in the greatest confusion, and left the Britons
masters of the field. A stone monument to perpetuate the remembrance of
this Alleluia victory, I believe, remains to this day, in a field near
Mold. - Charles Buck, 1771-1815.

[Psa 146:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#001.md)

"Praise the Lord, O my soul." The Psalmist calls upon the noblest
element of his being to exercise its noblest function. - Hermann Venema.

[Psa 146:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#002.md)

"While I live will I praise the Lord." Mr. John Janeway on his death-bed
cried out thus, - "Come, help me with praises, yet all is too little.
Come, help me, all ye mighty and glorious angels, who are so well
skilled in the heavenly work of praise! Praise him, all ye creatures
upon earth; let every thing that hath being help me to praise God.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Praise is now my work, and I shall
be engaged in this sweet work now and for ever. Bring the Bible; turn to
David's Psalms, and let us sing a Psalm of praise. Come, let us lift up
our voices in the praises of the Most High. I will sing with you as long
as my breath doth last, and when I have none, I shall do it better."

[Psa 146:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#002.md)

"While I live will I praise the Lord." - George Carpenter, the Bavarian
martyr, being desired by some godly brethren, that when he was burning
in the fire he would give them some sign of his constancy, answered,
"Let this be a sure sign unto you of my faith and perseverance in the
truth, that so long as I am able to hold open my mouth, or to whisper, I
will never cease to praise God, and to profess his truth"; the which
also he did, saith mine author; and so did many other martyrs besides. -
John Trapp.

[Psa 146:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#002.md)

"I will sing praises unto my God while I have my being." He had
consecrated his entire earthly existence to the exercise of praise. And
not only so, but he adds, "I will sing praises unto my God while I have
any being." In which expression we may fairly conclude that the Psalmist
stretches his thoughts beyond the limits of time, and contemplates that
scene of eternal praise which shall succeed the less perfect songs of
the church below. - John Morison.

[Psa 146:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#002.md)

"Unto my God." Then praise is most pleasant, when in praising God we
have an eye to him as ours, whom we have an interest in, and stand in
relation to. - Matthew Henry.

[Psa 146:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#002.md)

"While I have any being." Praise God for deliverance constantly. Some
will be thankful while the memory of a deliverance is fresh, and then
leave off. The Carthaginians used, at first, to send the tenth of their
yearly revenues to Hercules; and then by degrees they grew weary, and
left off sending; but we must be constant in our eucharistic sacrifice,
or thankoffering. The motion of our praise must be like the motion of
our pulse, which beats as long as life lasts. - Thomas Watson.

[Psa 146:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#003.md)

"Put not your trust in princes," etc. Through some kind of weakness, the
soul of man, whensoever it is in tribulation here, despaireth of God,
and chooseth to rely on man. Let it be said to one when set in some
affliction, "There is a great man by whom thou mayest be set free;" he
smileth, he rejoiceth, he is lifted up. But if it is said to him, "God
freeth thee," he is chilled, so to speak, by despair. The aid of the
mortal is promised, and thou rejoicest; the aid of the Immortal is
promised, and art thou sad? It is promised thee that thou shalt be freed
by one who needeth to be freed with thee, and thou exultest as at some
great aid: thou art promised that great Liberator, who needeth none to
free him, and thou despairest, as though it were but a fable. Woe to
such thoughts: they wander far; truly there is sad and great death in
them. - Augustine.

[Psa 146:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#003.md)

"Put not your trust in princes." The word rendered "princes" signifieth
liberal, bountiful ones, ἐμεργέται, so princes would be accounted; but
there's no trusting to them without God, or against him. - John Trapp.

[Psa 146:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#003.md)

"Put not your trust in princes." King Charles had given the Earl of
Strafford a solemn pledge, on the word of a king, that he should not
suffer in "life, honour, or fortune," yet with singular baseness and
ingratitude, as well as short-sighted policy, gave his assent to the
bill of attainder, On learning that this had been done, Strafford,
laying his hand on his heart, and raising his eyes to heaven, uttered
the memorable words, "Put not your trust in princes, nor in the sons of
men, for in them there is no salvation." - James Taylor, in the
"Imperial Dictionary of Universal Biography," 1868.

[Psa 146:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#003.md)

"Put not your trust in princes." Shakespeare puts this sentiment into
Wolsey's mouth: -

"O how wretched

Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favour!

There is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,

That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,

More pangs and fears than wars and women have:

And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,

Never to hope again."

[Psa 146:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#003.md)

"Put not your trust in princes," etc. True, may some say, it were a
folly to trust in weak princes, to trust in them for help who have no
power to help; but we will apply to mighty princes; we hope there is
help in them. No; those words, "in whom there is no help," are not a
distinction of weak princes from strong, but a conclusion that there is
no help in the strongest. That's strange. What? No help in strong
princes! If he had said, no help in mean men, carnal reason would have
consented; but when he saith, "Trust not in princes, nor in any son of
man" one or other, who can believe this? Yet this is divine truth; we
may write insufficiency, insufficiency, and a third time, insufficiency,
upon them all; the close of this verse may be their motto, "There is no
help in them." - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 146:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#003.md)

"Princes." Earthly princes offer baubles to allure the soul from the
pursuit of an eternal prize. Princes themselves have pronounced their
principality to be their own greatest peril. Pope Pius V. said, "When I
was a monk I had hope of my salvation; when I became Cardinal I began to
fear; when I was made Pope I all but despaired of eternity." - Thomas Le
Blanc.

[Psa 146:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#003.md)

"Nor in the son of man." All sons of man are like the man they are
sprung of, who, being in honour, did not abide. - Matthew Henry.

[Psa 146:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#003.md)

For one man to put confidence in another, is as if one beggar should ask
an alms of another, or one cripple should carry another, or the blind
lead the blind. - Anthony Farindon.

[Psa 146:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#003.md), [Psa
146:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#004.md)

You see the first and the last, highest and lowest, of all the sons of
Adam, they may be made honourable "princes," but they are born sinful,
"the sons of men"; born weak, "there is no help in them"; born mortal,
"their breath departeth;" born corruptible, "they return to their
earth"; and lastly, the mortality and corruption is not only in their
flesh, but in some part or remnant of their spirits, for "their thoughts
perish." The prophet (if you mark it) climbeth up by degrees to the
disabling of the best men amongst us, and in them of all the rest. For
if princes deserve not confidence, the argument must needs hold by
comparison, much less do meaner men deserve it. The order of the words
is so set that the members following are evermore either the reason or
some confirmation to that which went before. "Trust not in princes."
Why? Because they are "the sons of men." Why not in "the sons of men"?
Because there is no help in them. Why is there no help in them? Because
when "their breath goeth forth, they turn again to their earth." What if
their flesh be corrupted? Nay, "their thoughts" also "come to nothing."

For, first, this first order and rank which the prophet hath here
placed, the princes and gods of the earth, are by birth men; secondly,
weak men, and such in whom no help is; thirdly, not only weak, but
dying, their breath goeth out; fourthly, not only dying, but subject to
dissolution, they turn to the earth; fifthly, if their bodies only were
dissolved, and their intentions and actions might stand, there were less
cause to distrust them; but their thoughts are as transitory as their
bodies. - John King (1559? - 1621), in a Funeral Sermon.

[Psa 146:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#003.md), [Psa
146:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#004.md)

The Psalmist inscribes an antithesis. Princes, though masters of armies,
possessors of riches, loaded with honours, revelling in pleasures, are
at the mercy of a ruthless Black Prince. Death is tyrant over prince and
peasant alike. The very pleasures which are envied are often ministers
of death to voluptuous princes. - Thomas Le Blanc.

[Psa 146:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#004.md)

"He returneth to his earth." The earth - the dust - is "his."

I. It is "his" as that from which he was made, he turns back to what he
was, [Gen 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#019.md). "Dust thou art, and
unto dust shalt thou return."

II\. The earth - the dust - the grave is "his," and it is his home - the
place where he will abide.

III\. It is "his" as it is the only property which he has in reversion.
All that a man - a prince, a nobleman, a monarch, a millionaire - will
soon have will be his grave, his few feet of earth. That will be his by
right of possession, by the fact that for the time being he will occupy
it, and not another man! But that, too, may soon become another man's
grave, so that even there he is a tenant only for a time; he has no
permanent possession even of a grave. - Albert Barnes.

[Psa 146:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#004.md)

"His breath goeth forth." There is the death's-head, the mortality of
man indeed, that a breath is as much as his being is worth. Our soul,
that spiraculum vitarum (breath of lives), the Lord inspired it, not
into Adam's eye, or ear, or mouth, but into his nostrils, which may show
to man his imbecility, cujus anima in naribus, whose soul is in his
nostrils, and dependeth upon a breath, as it were; for the very soul
must away if but breath expires; soul and breath go forth together.

Now hear this, all ye people, ponder it high and low; your castle is
built upon the very air, the subsistence is in your nostrils, in a
breath that is gone in the twinkling of an eye. Wherefore David maketh a
question, saying, "Lord, what is man?" He answereth himself also: "Man
is a vanishing shadow" ([Psa 144:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#003.md),
[Psa 144:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#004).md), a shadow of smoke, or the
dream of a shadow rather, as the poet speaketh. Blessed therefore are
the poor in spirit; this advantage have all afflicted ones, that they
have checks enough to call them home, and make them see they be but men.
The curtain of honour, profit, or pleasure, hard it is and rare to draw
aside when it is spread over us: "man in honour understandeth not" ([Psa
49:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#020).md). To great ones therefore be it
spoken; the Psalm intendeth it of very princes: "His breath goeth
forth."

See we now the continuedness, exit, "it goeth"; as if it were now
presently in its passage: showing this, that Homo vivens continue
moritur, that life is a continued death; our candle lightens, consumes,
and dies: as in the passing of an hour-glass, every minute some sand
falleth, and the glass once turned, no creature can intreat the sands to
stay, but they continue to fall till all are gone: so is our life, it
shortens and dies every minute, and we cannot beg a minute of time back,
and that which we call death is but the termination, or consummation of
it. - Thomas Williamson; in a Sermon, entitled, "A Comfortable
Meditation of Humane Frailtie and Divine Mercie," 1630.

[Psa 146:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#004.md)

The primary idea of breath and the secondary one of spirit run into each
other in the usage of the Hebrew word רוח, so that either may be
expressed in the translation without entirely excluding the other. -
Joseph Addison Alexander.

[Psa 146:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#004.md)

"His breath (or spirit) goeth forth." Now I come to the liberty of the
spirit, that it recedes inviolate; 1. In Act; "it goeth" 2. In Essence;
"it goeth forth."

I. Our spirit is free in the act; it is not snatched out, as it were;
"it goeth." A soul in life sealed to eternity by the first fruits of the
Spirit hath its good issue, its free passing, its hopes even in death;
for let this breath fade, fidelis Deus, God who cannot lie, will stand
nigh us in that exigency, and begin to help where man leaveth. The Holy
Spirit, whose name is the Comforter, will not omit and leave off his own
act or office in the great needs of death. Hence good Hilarion, having
served the Lord Christ seventy years, checks his soul that it was so
loth at the last to go forth, saying, Egredere, O anima mea, egredere,
"Go forth, my soul, go forth." Devout Simeon sueth for a manumission,
"Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy
word." The spirit goeth forth; it passes freely; because it taketh up or
embraceth the cross of Christ, as he commandeth us to do. But is the act
at our will and liberty? Not simply. We may not projicere anitaare,
thrust or cast forth our breath or spirit; spiritus exit, it goeth
forth. Strive, we must, to cast the world out of us; we may not cast
ourselves out of the world. Saint Paul dareth not dissolve himself,
though he could wish to be dissolved, God must part that which he joins;
God giveth, and God taketh away; and if God say, as he doth to Lazarus,
Exi foras, Come forth; with faithful Stephen we must resign our spirit
and all into his hands. When God biddeth us yoke, he is the wisest man
that yieldeth his neck most willingly. When our great Captain recalls
us, we must take the retreat in good part. But it is heathenish to force
out the soul; for when the misdeeming flesh, amidst our disasters, will
not listen with patience for God's call, but rather shake off the
thought of divine providence quite, then are we ready to curse God, and
die, and that is probably to leap e fumo in flaremum, out of the sin of
self-murder into hell. No, but God will have our spirits to pass forth
Upon good terms. Spiritus exit, "the spirit goeth forth."

II\. Secondly, the spirit goeth free or inviolate in essence; death is
not the end, but the outgoing of the soul, a transmigration or journey
from one place to another. "It goeth forth;" so the character of our
weakness we see in the issue; it is an argument of our eternity; for man
indeed is perishing, but so is not his spirit. The phoenix goes forth or
out of his ashes, "the spirit returneth to God who gave it" ([Ecc
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#007).md); that is, it abides still; and
as in the body it pleased God to inclose the soul for a season, so it
may as well exist elsewhere without it, if God will; for it hath no rise
at all from the clay, yea, it bears in it immortality, an image of that
breast whence it is breathed. The separate and very abstract acts of the
spirit, even while it is in the body, the wondrous visions of the Lord
to his prophets, usually when their bodies were bound up in sleep; Saint
Paul's rapture when he knew not whether he was in the body or out of it;
the admirable inventions and arts of men, manifest the soul's
self-consisting. Not Socrates, and Cato, and the civilised heathen only,
but the very savages believe this, and so entertain death, ut exitum,
non ut exitium, as a dissolution, not as a destruction: spiritus exit,
"his spirit goeth forth.". - Thomas Williamson.

[Psa 146:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#004.md)

"His breath goeth forth," etc. The Hebrew gives the idea not that the
spirit, but the mortal part of man will return to the dust. "His soul
(fem. רוח) goeth forth," i.e., returneth to God: "returneth he (masc.
שׁב) to his earth." As In [Ecc 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#007.md) :
"He" is the mortal man of clay, but "his breath" (soul) is the real
Immortal man. - Simon de Muis.

[Psa 146:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#004.md)

"He returneth to his earth." Returning, in its proper notion, is a-going
back to that place from whence we came, so that in this clause here is a
threefold truth, implied, expressed, inferred.

I. That which is implied in this phrase of returning is, that man in
respect of his body came from the earth; and as it is here implied, so
it is expressed concerning the first man by Moses ([Gen
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007).md). "The Lord God formed man" (that
is, the body of man) "of the dust"; or according to the Hebrew, "dust of
the ground"; and by St. Paul ([Co1
15:47](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#047).md), where he saith, "The first man
is of the earth, earthy." True it is, we are formed in our mother's
womb; but yet inasmuch as we all came from the first man, we are truly
said to come from the earth; only with this difference, that he
immediately, we mediately are framed out of the earth. This truth was
engraven in full characters upon the name of the first man, who is
called Adam, from a word that signifieth red earth, and that very word
is here used, perhaps to mind us of that earth whereof man was first
made; yea, according to the usual etymology, the name homo, which in the
Latin is a common name to both sexes, is derived ab humo, from the
ground. For this reason it is that the earth is called by the poet magna
parens, the great parent of all mankind, and in the answer of the
Oracle, our mother; and in this respect we are said by Eliphaz "to dwell
in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust," [Job
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#019.md).

II\. That which is expressed is, that man (when he dieth) returneth to
the earth, πάντες λυόμενοι κόνις ἐσμέν, saith the poet, "We are all dust
when dissolved." As the white snow when melted is black water; so flesh
and blood when bereaved of the soul become dust and ashes: in which
respect St. Paul giveth this epithet of "vile" to our bodies. [Phi
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021.md). Indeed, man's original being
from the earth, he had a natural propensity to earth; according to the
maxim, Omne principiatum sequitur naturam principiorum, "Everything hath
an aptitude of returning to the principle whence it cometh"; but yet had
he not turned away from God he had never actually returned thither. It
is sin which hath brought upon man a necessity of dying, and that dying
brings a necessity of returning to the earth: in which respect it is
observable, that the threat, "thou shalt die the death" ([Gen
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#017).md), which was denounced against man
before his fall, being afterwards renewed ([Phi
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019).md), is explained (as to temporal
death) by these words, "to dust thou shalt return"; so that now the
motion of the little world man is like that of the great, Circulare ab
eodem puncto ad idem, from the same to the same; and that as in his soul
from God to God, so in his body from the earth to the earth. The rivers
come from the sea, and they return thither. The sun ariseth out of the
east, and thither it returneth. Man is formed of the earth, and into
earth he is again transformed: with which agreeth that of the poet
Lucretius:

Cedit item retro de terra quod fuit ante.

III\. That which is inferred in the emphatical pronoun "his," which is
annexed to the noun "earth," is that the earth to which man returneth is
his; this being that which ariseth out of both the former conclusions;
since it is therefore his earth because he cometh from and returneth to
it. Earth is man's Genesis and Analysis, his composition and resolution,
his Alpha and Omega, his first and last; Ortus pulvis, finis cinis;
earth is his both originally and finally. So that our bodies can
challenge no alliance with, or property in any thing so much as earth.
For if we call those things ours which had only an external relation to
us, as our friends, our horses, our goods, our lands; much more may we
call that our earth whereof we are made and into which we shall moulder;
no wonder it is here said to be "his"; so elsewhere he is said to be
earth, as being called by that name. - Nathanael Hardy, in a Funeral
Sermon entitled, "Man's Last Journey to His Long Home," 1659.

[Psa 146:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#004.md)

"In that very day his thoughts perish." The thoughts which the Psalmist
here, no doubt, especially intends are those purposes which are in the
minds of great men of doing good to those who are under, and depend upon
them. The Hebrew word here used is derived from a verb that signifieth
to be bright: cogitationes serenae, those candid, serene, benign,
benevolent thoughts which they have of advancing their allies, friends
and followers. These thoughts are said to "perish" in "that day" wherein
they are conceived; so Tremellius glosseth. In which sense the
instability of great men's favour is asserted, whose smiles are quickly
changed into frowns, love into hatred, and so in a moment their mind
being changed, their well-wishing thoughts vanish. But more rationally,
"their thoughts perish in that day" wherein their persons die, because
there is no opportunity of putting their purposes into execution. They
perish like the child which comes to the birth, and there is no strength
to bring forth; or like the fruit which is plucked off before it be
ripe. Whilst they live we may be deceived in our expectations by the
alteration of their minds; but, however, their condition is mortal, and
when that great change by death comes, their designs (how well soever
meant) must want success.

From hence it followeth, which is by some looked upon as a part of the
meaning of the words, that the "thoughts" or hopes of them who trust in
them perish. It is a true apothegm, Major pars hominum expectando
moritur; the greatest part of men perish by expectation. And good
reason, inasmuch as their expectation, being misplaced, perisheth. How
strongly this argument serveth to press the Psalmist's caution against
confidence in man, though never so great, is obvious. It is true,
princes and nobles being invested with honour, wealth and authority,
have power in their hands, and perhaps they may have thoughts in their
hearts to do thee good; but, alas, how uncertain is the execution of
those intentions, and therefore how foolish is it to depend upon them.
"Trust in the Lord Jehovah" (saith the prophet), "for with him is
everlasting strength." Ay, and with him is unchangeable goodness. It is
safe building upon the rock, trusting upon God, whose thoughts of mercy
are (like himself) from everlasting to everlasting; but nothing is more
foolish than to build on the sand, trust to men, whose persons, together
with their thoughts, perish in a moment. Therefore let our resolution be
that of David, "It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence
in man; it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in
princes," [Psa 118:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#008.md), [Psa
118:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#009.md). - Nathanael Hardy.

[Psa 146:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#004.md)

"In that very day his thoughts perish." At death a man sees all those
thoughts which were not spent upon God to be fruitless. All worldly,
vain thoughts, in the day of death perish and come to nothing. What good
will the whole globe of the world do at such a time? Those who have
revelled out their thoughts in impertinences will but be the more
disquieted; it will cut them to the heart to think how they have spun a
fool's thread. A Scythian captain having, for a draught of water,
yielded up a city, cried out, "What have I lost? What have I betrayed?"
So will it be with that man when he comes to die, who hath spent all his
meditations upon the world; he will say, What have I lost? What have I
betrayed? I have lost heaven, I have betrayed my soul. Should not the
consideration of this fix our minds upon the thoughts of God and glory?
All other meditations are fruitless; like a piece of ground which hath
much cost laid out upon it, but it yields no crop. - Thomas Watson.

[Psa 146:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#004.md)

I would have you take this passage and illustrate it as applying to
purposes, projects, and intentions. That, I think now, is precisely the
idea intended to be conveyed. "In that very day his thoughts perish";
his purposes, his projects - what he intended to do. These cherished
thoughts are gone. My dear brethren, there is something here for us. You
find many beautiful passages and instances in Scripture in which this
idea is embodied and realised, sometimes with great beauty and poetic
effect, in relation to the enemies of the church. "The enemy said, I
will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil, my hand shall
destroy them; thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them, they
sank as lead in the mighty waters." In that very day their thoughts
perished. "Have they not sped? have they not divided the prey? to every
man a damsel or two? to Sisera a prey of divers colours of needlework?
So let all thine enemies perish, O Lord." The sacred poet does not even
suggest that they had perished; but feeling that it was a fact, only
lifts up her heart to God. "So let all thine enemies perish, O Lord."
And so you will find in many parts of Scripture beautiful ideas like
this concerning the purposes and intentions that were in men's hearts
utterly "perishing" by God's just laying his hand upon them - the
purposes that were in their hearts against the church. - Thomas Binney.

"In that very daft his thoughts perish." In the case of the rich fool
([Luk 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#016.md), [Luk
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#020).md), his "thoughts" of building
larger barns, and of many years of ease and prosperity, - all his
selfish and worldly schemes, - "perished" in that self-same night. -
John W. Haley, in "An Examination of the Alleged Discrepancies of the
Bible," 1875.

[Psa 146:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#004.md)

"His thoughts perish." The science, the philosophy, the statesmanship of
one age is exploded in the next. The men who are the masters of the
world's intellect to-day are discrowned to-morrow. In this age of
restless and rapid change they may survive their own thoughts; their
thoughts do not survive them. - J. J. Stewart Perowne.

[Psa 146:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#004.md)

"His thoughts perish." As the purposes of all about worldly things
perish in the approaches of death, so do the purposes of some about
spiritual and heavenly things. How many have had purposes to repent, to
amend their lives and turn to God, which have been prevented and totally
broken off by the extremity of pain and sickness, but chiefly by the
stroke of death when they have (as they thought) "been about to repent,"
and (as we say) "turn over a new leaf" in their lives; they have been
turned into the grave by death, and into hell by the just wrath of God.
- Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 146:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#004.md)

"His thoughts." Rather, "his false, deceitful show"; literally, "his
glitterings." - Samuel Horsley, 1733-1806.

[Psa 146:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#004.md)

To trust man is to lean not on a pillar but on a little heap of dust.
The proudest element in man is his thought. In the thoughts of his heart
he is lifted up if nowhere else; but, behold, even his proudest
thoughts, says the Psalmist, will be degraded and perish in that dust to
which he will return. Poor, perishing pride! Who should trust it? -
Johannes Paulus Palanterius.

[Psa 146:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#005.md)

"Happy is he." This is the last of the twenty-five places (or
twenty-six, if [Psa 128:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#002) be included.md)
in which the word ashre, with which the Psalter begins, is found. -
Speaker's Commentary.

Alas, how often do we trust when we should be afraid, and become afraid
when we should trust! - Lange's Commentary.

[Psa 146:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#005.md)

"The God of Jacob." A famous and significant description of God; and
that, First, in respect of his nature, or the verity and reality of his
being and excellence. He is styled here by way of elegancy or emphasis,
"The God of Jacob," saith Mollerus, to discern and distinguish the true
God of Israel from all Heathenish deities, and to explode all fictitious
gods and all worships thereof. As the true God is the God of Jacob, so
the God of Jacob is the true God. He is God alone, and there is no other
besides him ... Secondly. This title or appellation serves also to
describe him in his special relation to his people. We find him called
by our Psalmist, "The mighty God of Jacob". [Psa
132:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#005.md). He is indeed the God of the
whole earth, but in a peculiar manner "the God of Israel". [Mat
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#031.md)... It is observable in Scripture
that he styles not himself so frequently, in his revelations of himself
to them, "the God of heaven and earth" (though that also is a title full
of encouragement), but "the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob"; as if he
had borne such choice goodwill, and had such a peculiar care for these
three men, as to overlook all the world besides them. So near and
intimate relation have God's people to him, that their interests are
mutually involved, and twisted in a reciprocal and covenant bond. They
are his, he is their portion; their Beloved is theirs and they are his'
they are called by his name, the saints are styled his "holy ones," and
the Church is termed expressly "Christ." Yea, he condescends to be
called by their name; he assumes the name of Jacob, [Psa
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#006.md), "This is the generation of them
that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob." - From "The Saints'
Ebenezer," by F. E., 1667.

[Psa 146:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#005.md)

"The God of Jacob." This verse aptly warrants us to apply to all
believers all the illustrations of help and hope furnished by Jacob in
his exile when none but God could help him. - Simon de Muis.

[Psa 146:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#005.md), [Psa
146:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#006.md)

"The God of Jacob which made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that
therein is." It is a characteristic of these Psalms, to proclaim to all
nations which worshipped idols that "the God of Jacob," "the God of
Zion," is the Creator and Governor of all things; and to make an appeal
to all nations to turn to him. All these Psalms have a missionary
character and an evangelical function. We may compare here the apostolic
prayer at Jerusalem, after the descent of the Holy Ghost at Pentecost;
"They lifted up their voices to God with one accord, and said, Lord,
thou art God, that made heaven and earth, and the sea, and all that in
them is" (where the words are the same as in the Septuagint in this
place). "Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why do the
heathen rage?" [Act 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#024.md), [Act
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#025.md). The office of these Psalms is to
declare to the universe, that Jehovah, and he alone, is Elohim; and to
invite all to worship him as such, by their oft repeated Hallelujah. -
Christopher Wordsworth.

[Psa 146:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#006.md)

"Which keepeth truth for ever." Stored in his inexhaustible treasury as
the most costly jewel ever there. And that because the truth which he so
keeps, and which is the sustaining power which preserves the fabric of
creation, is the Eternal Word, his only begotton Son, Jesus Christ. -
Dionysius the Carthusian, and Ayguan, in Neale and Littledale.

[Psa 146:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#006.md)

"Which keepeth truth for ever." God does indeed keep the truth from age
to age - how else would the Book of God have lived? - John Lorinus.

[Psa 146:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#006.md)

The Lord, is an Almighty God, as the Creator of the universe; next, he
is a faithful God "who keepeth truth for ever"; further, he is a
righteous God ([Psa 146:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#007).md), a
bountiful God (lb.) a gracious God ([Psa
146:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#007).md). - J. J. Stewart Perowne.

[Psa 146:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#007.md)

"Giveth food to the hungry." We learn from this that he is not always so
indulgent to his own as to load them with abundance, but occasionally
withdraws his blessing, that he may succour them when reduced to hunger.
Had the Psalmist said that God fed his people with abundance, and
pampered them, would not any of those under want or in famine have
immediately desponded? The goodness of God is therefore properly
extended farther to the feeding of the hungry. - John Calvin.

[Psa 146:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#007.md)

"Giveth food to the hungry." Now, that Jesus was that Lord of whom the
Psalmist in this place, and in [Psa
145:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#016.md), speaketh, was fully testified
by the miracles which he wrought, in feeding many thousands with some
few loaves and two small fishes, and in filling so many baskets with the
fragments or relics of that provision wherewith he had filled thousands.
From these miracles, the people which had seen him do them, and tasted
of his bounty, did rightly infer that he was the prophet which was to
come into the world, as you may read, [Joh
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#014.md); and being supposed to be the
prophet, they consequently presumed that he was likewise to be the King
of Israel; and out of this concert or presumption they would have
enforced him to be their king, verse 15. - Thomas Jackson, 1579-1640.

[Psa 146:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#007.md)

"The Lord looseth the prisoners." As in that place of Isaiah ([Isa
61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001).md) the phrase of "opening the
prison to them that are bound," is by the learned thought to be a
prophetic elegance, to signify the cure of those that are deaf and dumb,
whose souls consequently were shut up from being able to express
themselves, as language enables others to do; so here also it may be
used poetically, and then it will be directly parallel to that part of
Christ's answer, "the deaf hear" ([Mat
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#005).md). At the curing of such, Christ's
form of speech was, Ephphatha, "be opened," as to the door of a prison,
when those which were under restraint therein were to be let loose out
of it, their fetters being shaken off from them. But then, 'tis further
manifest, that those that were under any sore disease or lameness, etc.,
are said to be "bound by Satan" ([Luk
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#016).md), and be "loosed" by Christ,
when they were cured by him. So saith Christ ([Luk
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#012).md), "Woman, thou art loosed from
thine infirmity, and immediately she was made straight." Her being "made
straight" was her being loosed out of her restraint, or bonds, or
prison. And in this latitude of the poetic or prophetic expression, the
Lord's loosing the prisoners here will comprehend the walking of the
lame, the lepers being cleansed, the hearing of the deaf, yea, and the
raising up of the dead; for those of all others are fastest bound, and
so when they were raised, the style is as proper as to Lazarus in
respect of the graveclothes, "loose them, and let him go." - Henry
Hammond.

[Psa 146:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#007.md), [Psa
146:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#008.md)

It ought not to pass without remark that the name Jehovah is repeated
here five times in five lines, to intimate that it is an almighty power,
that of Jehovah, that is engaged and exerted for the relief of the
oppressed; and that it is as much to the glory of God to succour them
that are in misery, as it is to ride on the heavens by his name Jah,
[Psa 68:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#004.md). - Matthew Henry.

[Psa 146:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#008.md)

"Openeth the eyes of the blind." Literally, "openeth the blind" i.e.
maketh them to see. The expression may be used figuratively, as a remedy
applied either to physical helplessness, as [Deu
28:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#029.md); [Isa
59:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#009.md), [Isa
59:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#010.md); [Job
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#025.md); or to spiritual want of
discernment, as [Isa 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#018.md); [Isa
42:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#007.md), [Isa
42:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#018.md); [Isa
43:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#008.md). Here the context favours the
former. - J. J. Stewart Perowne.

[Psa 146:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#008.md)

"The Lord openeth the eyes of the blind." The Hebrew does not mention
the eyes of the blind. Hilary renders it sapientificat. The Arabic
version follows the same. Jehovah by his wisdom illumines dark minds. It
is mental blindness which is the common affliction of men. - John
Lorinus.

[Psa 146:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#008.md)

"The blind." The large number of blind persons to be seen feeling their
way along the streets in Cairo and Alexandria has been noticed by
Volney. "Walking in the streets of Cairo," he says, "out of a hundred
persons whom I met, there were often twenty blind, eighteen one eyed,
and twenty others with eyes red, purulent, or spotted. Almost every one
wears bandages, indicating that they either have or are recovering from
ophthalmia." Ophthalmia is, in fact, one of the scourges of Egypt, as
all physicians know. Its prevalence must be attributed in a great degree
to the sand which the wind blows into the eyes; but one can understand
how in Oriental countries in general the excessive heat of the sun must
make blindness much commoner than it is with us.

It is not therefore surprising to any one who knows the East to find the
blind so often mentioned in the gospel history, and to meet in Scripture
with so many allusions to this infirmity. Of the twelve maledictions of
the Levites there is one against him "who maketh the blind to go out of
the way": [Deu 27:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#018.md). "The spirit of
God hath anointed me," said Jesus, quoting from Isaiah, "to preach the
gospel to the poor, and recovery of sight to the blind": [Luk
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#019.md). "The Lord," says David, "setteth
at liberty them that are bound; the Lord giveth sight to the blind." -
Felix Bovet (1824 - ), in "Egypt, Palestine, and Phoenicia," 1882.

[Psa 146:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#009.md)

"The Lord preserveth the strangers." God has peculiar love for wanderers
and pilgrims ([Deu 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#018).md), and Jacob
was a stranger in a strange land when God showed himself to be the God
of Jacob as his elect servant. - Thomas Le Blanc.

[Psa 146:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#009.md)

"The Lord preserveth the strangers." They who do not belong to Babylon,
nor to this world, but the true pilgrims in a strange land. - Robert
Bellarmine.

[Psa 146:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#009.md)

"He relieveth the fatherless and widow." The olive tree is not to be
twice shaken, the vineyard is not to be twice gathered, nor are the
sheaves of corn left in the fields to be gleaned; all that belongs to
the poor, to the widow and the orphan. It was allowable to pluck with
the hand the ears of corn while passing through a neighbour's field
([Deu 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#025).md), though a sickle might
not be used. The law cares most anxiously for widows and orphans, for
"God is a father of the fatherless and a judge of the widows" ([Psa
68:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#005).md). A widow's raiment might not be
taken in pledge, and both widows and orphans were to be invited to their
feasts. An institution specially designed for the protection and relief
of the poor was the second tithe, the so-called poor's-tithe. The first
tithe belonged to the Levites. What remained over was again tithed, and
the produce of this second tithe, devoted in the first two years to a
feast in the sanctuary at the offering of first-fruits, was devoted in
the third year to a feast in the dwelling-house, to which the Levites
and the strangers, the widows and the orphans, were invited ([Deu
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#028.md), [Deu
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#029.md); [Deu
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#012.md), [Deu
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#013)..md) - G. Uhlhorn, in "Christian
Charity in the Ancient Church," 1883.

[Psa 146:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#009.md)

"The way of the wicked he turneth upside down." He overturns their
plans, defeats their schemes; makes their purposes accomplish what they
did not intend they should accomplish. The Hebrew word here means to
bend, to curve, to make crooked, to distort; then, to overturn, to turn
upside down. The same word is applied to the conduct of the wicked, in
[Psa 119:78](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#078.md) : "They dealt perversely
with me." The idea here is that the path is not a straight path; that
God makes it a crooked way; that they are diverted from their design;
that through them he accomplishes purposes which they did not intend;
that he prevents their accomplishing their own designs; and that he will
make their plans subservient to a higher and better purpose than their
own. This is the eleventh reason why those who put their trust in God
are happy. It is that God is worthy of confidence and love, because he
has all the plans of wicked men entirely under his control. - Albert
Barnes.

[Psa 146:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#009.md)

"The way of the wicked he turneth upside down." As the potter's clay,
when the potter hath spent some time and pains in tempering and forming
it upon the wheel, and now the vessel is even almost brought to its
shape, a man that stands by may, with the least push, put it clean out
of shape, and mar all on a sudden that he hath been so long a, making:
so is it that all the plots and contrivances of wicked men, all their
turning of things upside down shall be but as the potter's clay; for
when they think they have brought all to maturity, ripeness, and
perfection, when they look upon their business as good as done, all on a
sudden all their labour Is lost; for God, who stands by all the while
and looks on, will, with one small touch, with the least breath of his
wrath, blast and break all in pieces. - Edlin, 1656.

[Psa 146:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#009.md)

"The way of the wicked he turneth upside down." All the ten clauses
preceding lift up the poor saint step by step, higher and higher. At one
word suddenly, like Satan falling as lightning from heaven, the wicked
are shown dashed down the whole way from the summit of pride to the
depths of hell. - Johannes Paulus Palanterius.

[Psa 146:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#009.md)

"The way of the wicked he turneth upside down." A striking illustration
of the folly of counting God out of one's plans for life, is given in
the course of William M. Tweed, whose death is recently announced. Here
was a man who sought wealth and power, and who for a time seemed
successful in their pursuit. Apparently he did not propose to obey God
or to live for a life to come. What he wanted was worldly prosperity. He
thought he had it. He went to congress. He gathered his millions. He
controlled the material interests of the metropolis of his country. He
openly defied public sentiment and courts of justice in the prosecution
of his plans. He was a brilliant and therefore a dangerous example of
successful villainy. But the promise of prosperity for the life which
now is, is only to the godly. As William M. Tweed lay dying in a
prison-house in the city he once ruled, his confession of bitter
disappointment was, "My life has been a failure in everything. There is
nothing I am proud of." If any young man wants to come to an end like
this, the way to it is simple and plain. "The great God that formed all
things both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors." "The way
of the wicked he turneth upside down." - American Sunday School Times,
1878.

2 While I live will I praise the Lord: I will sing praises unto my God
while I have any being.

3 Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is
no help.

4 His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day
his thoughts perish.

5 Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in
the Lord his God:

6 Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: which
keepeth truth for ever:

7 Which executeth judgment for the oppressed, which giveth food to the
hungry. The Lord looseth the prisoners:

8 The Lord openeth the eyes of the blind, the Lord raiseth them that are
bowed down: the Lord loveth the righteous:

9 The Lord preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and
widow, but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.

10 The Lord shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, Unto all
generations. Praise ye the Lord.

[Psa 146:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#001.md)

"Praise ye the Lord," or, Hallelujah. It is saddening to remember how
this majestic word has been trailed in the mire of late. Its irreverent
use is an aggravated instance of taking the name of Jehovah our God in
vain. Let us hope that it has been done in ignorance by the ruder sort;
but great responsibility lies with leaders who countenance and even copy
this blasphemy. With holy awe let us pronounce the word HALLELUJAH, and
by it summon ourselves and all others to adore the God of the whole
earth. Men need to be called to praise; it is important that they should
praise; and there are many reasons why they should do it at once. Let
all who hear the word Hallelujah unite immediately in holy praise.

"Praise the Lord, O my soul." He would practise what he had preached. He
would be the leader of the choir which he had summoned. It is a poor
business if we solely exhort others, and do not stir up our own soul. It
is an evil thing to say, "Praise ye," and never to add, "Praise, O my
soul." When we praise God let us arouse our innermost self, our central
life, we have but one soul, and if it be saved from eternal wrath, it is
bound to praise its Saviour. Come heart, mind, thought! Come my whole
being, my soul, my all, be all on flame with joyful adoration! Up, my
brethren! Lift up the song! "Praise ye the Lord." But what am I at? How
dare I call upon others, and be negligent myself? If ever man was under
bonds to bless the Lord I am that man, wherefore let me put my soul into
the centre of the choir, and then let my better nature excite my whole
manhood to the utmost height of loving praise. "O for a well-tuned
harp!" Nay, rather, O for a sanctified heart. Then if my voice should be
of the poorer sort, and somewhat lacking in melody, yet my soul without
my voice shall accomplish my resolve to magnify the Lord.

[Psa 146:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#002.md)

"While I live I will praise the Lord." I shall not live here for ever.
This mortal life will find a finis in death; but while it lasts I will
laud the Lord my God. I cannot tell how long or short my life may be;
but every hour of it shall be given to the praises of my God. While I
live I'll love; and while I breathe I'll bless. It is but for a while,
and I will not wile that time away in idleness, but consecrate it to
that same service which shall occupy eternity. As our life is the gift
of God's mercy, it should be used for his glory. "I will sing praises
unto my God while I have any being." When I am no longer in being on
earth, I hope to have a higher being in heaven, and there I will not
only praise, but sing praises. Here I have to sigh and praise, but there
I shall only sing and praise. This "while I have any being" will be a
great while, but the whole of it shall be filled up with adoration; for
the glorious Jehovah is my God, my own God by covenant, and by blood
relationship in Christ Jesus. I have no being apart from my God,
therefore, I will not attempt to enjoy my being otherwise than by
singing to his honour. Twice the Psalmist says "I will"; here first
thoughts and second thoughts are alike good. We cannot be too firm in
the holy resolve to praise God, for it is the chief end of our living
and being that we should glorify God and enjoy him for ever.

[Psa 146:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#003.md)

"Put not your trust in princes." If David be the author this warning
comes from a prince. In any case it comes from the Spirit of the living
God. Men are always far too apt to depend upon the great ones of earth,
and forget the Great One above; and this habit is the fruitful source of
disappointment. Princes are only men, and men with greater needs than
others; why, then, should we look to them for aid? They are in greater
danger, are burdened with greater cares, and are more likely to be
misled than other men; therefore, it is folly to select them for our
confidence. Probably no order of men have been so false to their
promises and treaties as men of royal blood. So live as to deserve their
trust, but not burden them with your trust. "Nor the son of man, in whom
there is no help." Though you should select one son of man out of the
many, and should imagine that he differs from the rest and may be safely
depended on, you will be mistaken. There is none to be trusted, no, not
one. Adam fell; therefore lean not on his sons. Man is a helpless
creature without God; therefore, look not for help in that direction.
All men are like the few men who are made into princes, they are more in
appearance than in reality, more in promising than in performing, more
apt to help themselves than to help others. How many have turned away
heart-sick from men on whom they once relied! Never was this the case
with a believer in the Lord. He is a very present help in time of
trouble. In man there is no help in times of mental depression, in the
day of sore bereavement, in the night of conviction of sin, or in the
hour of death. What a horror when most in need of help to read those
black words, NO HELP!

[Psa 146:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#004.md)

"His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth." His breath goes
from his body, and his body goes to the grave. His spirit goes one way,
and his body another. High as he stood, the want of a little air brings
him down to the ground, and lays him under it. Man who comes from the
earth returns to the earth: it is the mother and sister of his body, and
he must needs lie among his kindred as soon as the spirit which was his
life has made its exit. There is a spirit in man, and when that goes the
man goes. The spirit returns to God who gave it, and the flesh to the
dust out of which it was fashioned. This is a poor creature to trust in:
a dying creature, a corrupting creature. Those hopes will surely fall to
the ground which are built upon men who so soon lie under ground.

"In that very day his thoughts perish." Whatever he may have proposed to
do, the proposal ends in smoke. He cannot think, and what he had thought
of cannot effect itself, and therefore it dies. Now that he has gone,
men are ready enough to let his thoughts go with him into oblivion;
another thinker comes, and turns the thoughts of his predecessor to
ridicule. It is a pitiful thing to be waiting upon princes or upon any
other men, in the hope that they will think of us. In an hour they are
gone, and where are their schemes for our promotion? A day has ended
their thoughts by ending them; and our trusts have perished, for their
thoughts have perished. Men's ambitions, expectations, declarations, and
boastings all vanish into thin air when the breath of life vanishes from
their bodies. This is the narrow estate of man, his breath, his earth,
and his thoughts; and this is his threefold climax therein, - his breath
goeth forth, to his earth he returns, and his thoughts perish. Is this a
being to be relied upon? Vanity of vanities, all is vanity. To trust it
would be a still greater vanity.

[Psa 146:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#005.md)

"Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help." Heaped up is his
happiness. He has happiness indeed: the true and the real delight is
with him. The God of Jacob is the God of the covenant, the God of
wrestling prayer, the God of the tried believer; he is the only living
and true God. The God of Jacob is Jehovah, who appeared unto Moses, and
led the tribes of Jacob out of Egypt, and through the wilderness. Those
are happy who trust him, for they shall never be ashamed or confounded.
The Lord never dies, neither do his thoughts perish: his purpose of
mercy, like himself, endures throughout all generations. Hallelujah!
"Whose hope is in the Lord his God." He is happy in help for the present
and in hope for the future, who has placed all his confidence in
Jehovah, who is his God by a covenant of salt. Happy is he when others
are despairing! Happiest shall he be in that very hour when others are
discovering the depths of agony. We have here a statement which we have
personally tried and proved: resting in the Lord, we know a happiness
which is beyond description, beyond comparison, beyond conception. O how
blessed a thing it is to know that God is our present help, and our
eternal hope. Full assurance is more than heaven in the bud, the flower
has begun to open. We would not exchange with Caesar; his sceptre is a
bauble, but our bliss is true treasure.

In each of the two titles here given, namely, "the God of Jacob," and
"Jehovah his God," there is a peculiar sweetness. Either one of them has
a fountain of joy in it; but the first will not cheer us without the
second. Unless Jehovah be his God no man can find confidence in the fact
that he was Jacob's God. But when by faith we know the Lord to be ours,
then we are "rich to all the intents of bliss."

[Psa 146:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#006.md)

"Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is." Wisely
may we trust our Creator, justly may we expect to be happy in so doing.
He who made heaven can make a heaven for us, and make us fit for heaven.
He who made the earth can preserve us while we are on earth, and help us
to make good use of it while we sojourn upon it. He who made the sea and
all its mysteries can steer us across the pathless deeps of a troubled
life, and make it a way for his redeemed to pass over. This God who
still makes the world by keeping it in existence is assuredly able to
keep us to his eternal kingdom and glory. The making of the worlds is
the standing proof of the power and wisdom of that great God in whom we
trust. It is our joy that he not only made heaven but the sea; not only
things which are bright and blessed, but things which are deep and dark.
Concerning all our circumstances, we may say the Lord is there. In
storms and hurricanes the Lord reigneth as truly as in that great calm
which rules the firmament above. "Which keepeth truth for ever." This is
a second and most forcible justification of our trust the Lord will
never permit his promise to fail. He is true to his own nature, true to
the relationships which he has assumed, true to his covenant, true to
his Word, true to his Son. He keeps true, and is the keeper of all that
is true. Immutable fidelity is the character of Jehovah's procedure.
None can charge him with falsehood or vacillation.

[Psa 146:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#007.md)

"Which executeth judgment for the oppressed." He is a swift and
impartial administrator of justice. Our king surpasses all earthly
princes because he pays no deference to rank or wealth, and is never the
respecter of persons. He is the friend of the down-trodden, the avenger
of the persecuted, the champion of the helpless. Safely may we trust our
cause with such a Judge if it be a just one, happy are we to be under
such a Ruler. Are we "evil, entreated"? Are our rights denied us? Are we
slandered? Let this console us, that he who occupies the throne will not
only think upon our case, but bestir himself to execute judgment on our
behalf. "Which giveth food to the hungry." Glorious King art thou, O
Jehovah! Thou dost not only mete out justice but thou dost dispense
bounty! All food comes from God; but when we are reduced to hunger, and
providence supplies our necessity, we are peculiarly struck with the
fact. Let every hungry man lay hold on this statement, and plead it
before the mercy-seat, whether he suffer bodily-hunger or heart-hunger.
See how our God finds his special clients among the lowest of mankind:
the oppressed and the starving find help in the God of Jacob "The Lord
looseth the prisoners." Thus he completes the triple blessing: justice,
bread, and liberty. Jehovah loves not to see man pining in dungeons, or
fretting in fetters; he brought up Joseph from the round-house, and
Israel from the house of bondage. Jesus is the Emancipator, spiritually,
providentially, and nationally. Thy chains, O Africa! were broken by his
hand. As faith in Jehovah shall become common among men freedom will
advance in every form, especially will mental, moral, and spiritual
bonds be loosed, and the slaves of error, sin, and death shall be set
free. Well might the Psalmist praise Jehovah, who is so kind to men in
bonds! Well may the loosened ones be loudest in the song!

[Psa 146:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#008.md)

"The Lord openeth the eyes of the blind." Jesus did this very
frequently, and hereby proved himself to be Jehovah. He who made the eye
can open it, and when he does so it is to his glory. How often is the
mental eye closed in moral night! And who can remove this dreary effect
of the fall but the Almighty God? This miracle of grace he has performed
in myriads of cases, and it is in each case a theme for loftiest praise.
"The Lord raiseth them that are bowed down." This also Jesus did
literally, thus doing the work peculiar to God. Jehovah consoles the
bereaved, cheers the defeated, solaces the despondent, comforts the
despairing. Let those who are bowed to the ground appeal to him, and he
will speedily upraise them. "The Lord loveth the righteous." He gives to
them the love of complacency, communion, and reward. Bad kings affect
the licentious, but Jehovah makes the upright to be his favoured ones.
This is greatly to his glory. Let those who enjoy the inestimable
privilege of his love magnify his name with enthusiastic delight. Loved
ones, you must never be absent from the choir! You must never pause from
his praise whose infinite love has made you what you are.

[Psa 146:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#009.md)

"The Lord preserveth the strangers." Many monarchs hunted aliens down,
or transported them from place to place, or left them as outlaws
unworthy of the rights of man; but Jehovah made special laws for their
shelter within his domain. In this country the stranger was, a little
while ago, looked upon as a vagabond, - a kind of wild beast to be
avoided if not to be assaulted; and even to this day there are
prejudices against foreigners which are contrary to our holy religion.
Our God and King is never strange to any of his creatures, and if any
are left in a solitary and forlorn condition he has a special eye to
their preservation. "He relieveth the fatherless and widow." These
excite his compassion, and he shows it in a practical way by upraising
them from their forlorn condition. The Mosaic law made provision for
these destitute persons. When the secondary fatherhood is gone the child
falls back upon the primary fatherhood of the Creator; when the husband
of earth is removed the godly widow casts herself upon the care of her
Maker. "But the way of the wicked he turneth upside down." He fills it
with crooked places; he reverses it, sets it down, or upsets it. That
which the man aimed at he misses, and he secures that for himself which
he would gladly have avoided. The wicked man's way is in itself a
turning of things upside down morally, and the Lord makes it so to him
providentially: everything goes wrong with him who goes wrong.

[Psa 146:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#010.md)

"The Lord shall reign for ever." Jehovah is King, and his kingdom can
never come to an end. Neither does he die, nor abdicate, nor lose his
crown by force. Glory be to his name, his throne is never in jeopardy.
As the Lord ever liveth, so he ever reigneth. "Even thy God, O Zion,
unto all generations." Zion's God, the God of his worshipping people, is
he who in every age shall reign. There will always be a Zion; Zion will
always have Jehovah for her King; for her he will always prove himself
to be reigning in great power. What should we do in the presence of so
great a King, but enter into his courts with praise, and pay to him our
joyful homage? "Praise ye the Lord." Again they said Hallelujah. Again
the sweet perfume arose from the golden vials full of sweet odours. Are
we not prepared for an outburst of holy song? Do not we also say -
Hallelujah? Here endeth this gladsome Psalm. Here endeth not the praise
of the Lord, which shall ascend for ever and ever. Amen.
