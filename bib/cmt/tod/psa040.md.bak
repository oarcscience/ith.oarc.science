### [Psalms Chapter 40](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 40:0</span></span>

Title - To the Chief Musician. Well might so exceedingly precious a
Psalm be specially committed to the most skilled of the sacred
musicians. The noblest music should be made tributary to a subject so
incomparable. The dedication shows that the song was intended for public
worship, and was not a merely personal hymn, as its being in the first
person singular might lead us to suppose. A Psalm of David. This is
conclusive as to the authorship: lifted by the Holy Spirit into the
region of prophecy, David was honoured thus to write concerning a far
greater than himself.

Subject - Jesus is evidently here, and although it might not be a
violent wresting of language to see both David and his Lord, both Christ
and the church, the double comment might involve itself in obscurity,
and therefore we shall let the sun shine even though this should conceal
the stars. Even if the New Testament were not so express upon it, we
should have concluded that David spoke of our Lord in [Psa
40:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md), but the apostle in [Heb
10:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005.md), puts all conjecture out of
court, and confines the meaning to Him who came into the world to do the
Father's will.

Division - From [Psa 40:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#001.md), is a
personal thanksgiving, followed by a general declaration of Jehovah's
goodness to his saints, [Psa 40:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#004.md),
[Psa 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#005.md). In [Psa
40:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md), we have an avowal of
dedication to the Lord's will; [Psa
40:11-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#011.md), contain a prayer for
deliverance from pressing trouble, and for the overthrow of enemies.

Hints to Preachers

[Psa 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#001.md)

I. My part - praying and waiting.

II\. God's part - condescension and reply.

[Psa 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#002.md)

I. The depth of God's goodness to his people. It finds them often in a
horrible pit and miry clay. There is a certain spider which forms a pit
in sand, and lies concealed at the bottom, in order to seize upon other
insects that fall into it. Thus David's enemies tried to bring him into
a pit.

II\. The height of his goodness. He brought me out, and set my feet upon
a rock. That rock is Christ. Those feet are faith and hope.

III\. The breadth of his goodness established my goings, restored me to
my former place in his love, showing me still to have been his during my
low estate. He was the same to me, though I felt not the same to him. My
goings refer both to the past and the future.

IV\. The strength of his goodness established my goings, making me stand
firmer after every fall.

\- George Rogers.

[Psa 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#002.md), [Psa
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#003.md) - The sinner's position by
nature, and his rescue by grace.

[Psa 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#002.md), [Psa
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#003.md) - By one and the same act the
Lord works our salvation, our enemies'

confusion, and the church's edification. - J. P. Lange's Commentary.

[Psa 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#003.md) - The new song, the singer,
the teacher.

[Psa 40:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#004) (last clause.md)

I. Find out who turn aside to lies - Atheists, Papists, self-righteous,
lovers of sin.

II\. Show their folly in turning aside from God and truth, and in
turning to fallacies which lead to death.

III\. Show how to be preserved from the like folly, by choosing truth,
truthful persons, and above all the service of God.

[Psa 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#005.md)

I. There are works of Gad in his people and for his people. There are
his works of creation, of providence, and of redemption, and also his
works of grace, wrought in them by his Spirit, and around them by his
providence, as well as for them by his Son.

II\. These are wonderful works; wonderful in their variety, their
tenderness, their adaptation to their need, their co-operation with
outward means and their power.

III\. They are the result of the divine thoughts respecting us. They
come not by chance, not by men, but by the hand of God, and that hand is
moved by his will, and that will by his thought respecting us. Every
mercy, even the least, represents some kind thought in the mind of God
respecting us. God thinks of each one of his people, and every moment.

IV\. They are innumerable. "They cannot be reckoned up." Could we see
all the mercies of God to us and his wonderful work wrought for us
individually, they would be countless as the sands, and all these
countless mercies represent countless thoughts in the mind and heart of
God to each one of his people. - George Rogers.

[Psa 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#005.md) - The multitude of God's
thoughts, and deeds of grace, beginning in eternity, continuing for
ever; and dealing with this life, heaven, hell, sin, angels, devils, and
indeed all things.

[Psa 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md) - Here David goes beyond
himself, and speaks the language of David's Son. This was naturally
suggested by God's wonderful works, and innumerable thoughts of love to
man.

I. The sacrifices that were not required. These were the sacrifices and
burnt-offerings under the law.

1\. When required? From Adam to the coming of Christ.

2\. When not required?

3\. Why required before? As types of the one method of redemption.

4\. Why not now required? Because the great Antetype had come.

II\. The sacrifice that was required. This was the sacrifice offered on
Calvary.

1\. It was required by God by his justice, his wisdom, his faithfulness,
his love, his honour, his glory.

2\. It was required by man to give him salvation and confidence in that
salvation.

3\. It was required for the honour of the moral government of God
throughout the universe.

III\. The person by whom this sacrifice was offered. "Mine ears hast
thou opened." This is the language of. Christ, prospectively denoting -

1\. Knowledge of the sacrifice required.

2\. Consecration of himself as a servant for that end.

\- George Rogers.

[Psa 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md) - "Mine ears hast thou
opened." Readiness to hear, fixity of purpose, perfection of obedience,
entireness of consecration.

[Psa 40:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md) - The Lord gives an ear to
hear his word, a mouth to confess it, a heart to love it, and power to
keep it.

[Psa 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007.md)

I. The time of Christ's coming. "Then said I." When types were
exhausted, when prophecies looked for their fulfilment, when worldly
wisdom had done its utmost, when the world was almost entirely united
under one empire, when the time appointed by the Father had come.

II\. The design of his coming. "In the volume" was written -

1\. The constitution of his person.

2\. His teaching.

3\. The manner of his life.

4\. The design of his death.

5\. His resurrection and ascension.

6\. The kingdom he would establish.

III\. The voluntariness of his coming, "Lo, I come." Though sent by the
Father, he came of his own accord. "Christ Jesus came into the world."
Men do not come into the world, they are sent into it. "Lo, I come,"
denotes pre-existence, pre-determination, pre-operation.

\- George Rogers.

[Psa 40:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#008.md) - "To do thy will, O God."

I. The will of God is seen in the fact of salvation. It has its origin
in the will of God.

II\. The will of God is seen in the plan of salvation. All things have
proceeded, are proceeding, and will proceed according to that plan.

III\. It is seen in the provision of salvation, in the appointment of
his own Son to become the mediator, the atoning sacrifice, the
law-fulfiller, the head of the church, that his plan required.

IV\. It is seen in the accomplishment of salvation.

[Psa 40:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#009.md) - Referring to our Lord; a
great preacher a great subject, a great congregation, and his great
faithfulness in the work.

[Psa 40:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#010) (first clause.md)

I. The righteousness possessed by God.

II\. The righteousness prescribed by God.

III\. The righteousness provided by God.

\- James Frame.

[Psa 40:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#010.md) -

I. The preacher must reveal his whole message.

1\. Not of the righteousness of the law or the gospel.

2\. Not of the lovingkindness of grace.

3\. Not of any portion of the truth.

II\. He must not conceal any part.

1\. To omit is to conceal.

2\. To entangle with human reasonings.

3\. To cover with flowers of rhetoric.

4\. To give a partial representation.

5\. To put one truth in the place of another.

6\. To give the letter without the spirit.

\- G. R.

[Psa 40:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#010.md) - The great sin of
concealing what we know of God.

[Psa 40:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#011.md) - Enrichment and
preservation sought. The true riches are from God, gifts of his
sovereignty, fruits of his mercy, marked with his tenderness. The best
preservations are divine love and faithfulness.

[Psa 40:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#012.md) - Compare this with [Psa
40:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#005.md). The number of our sins, and the
number of his thoughts of love.

[Psa 40:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#012) (second clause.md)

I. The soul arrested - "taken hold."

II\. The soul bewildered - "cannot look up."

III\. The soul's only refuge - prayer, [Psa
40:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#013.md).

[Psa 40:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#013.md)

I. The language of believing prayer - deliver me, help me; looking for
deliverance and help to God only.

II\. Of earnest prayer - make haste to help me.

III\. Of submissive prayer - be pleased, O Lord, if according to thy
good pleasure.

IV\. Of consistent prayer. Help me, which implies efforts for his own
deliverance, putting his own shoulder to the wheel.

[Psa 40:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#011.md) - As an instance of
clerical ingenuity, it may be well to mention that Canon Wordsworth has
a sermon from these verses upon "The duty of making responses in public
prayer."

[Psa 40:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#014.md) - Honi soit qui mal y
pense; or, the reward of malignity.

[Psa 40:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#016) (last clause.md) - An everyday
saying. Who can use it? What does it mean? Why should they say it? Why
say it continually?

[Psa 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#017.md) - The humble "But," and the
believing "Yet." The little "I am," and the great "Thou art." The
fitting prayer.

[Psa 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#017.md) - "The Lord thinketh upon
me." Admire the condescension, and then consider that this is -

I. A promised blessing.

II\. A practical blessing - he thinks upon us to supply, protect,
direct, sanctify, etc.

III\. A precious blessing - kind thoughts, continual, greatly good. He
thinks of us as his creatures with pity, as his children with love, as
his friends with pleasure.

IV\. A present blessing - promises, providences, visitations of grace.

[Psa 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#017.md) -

I. The less we think of ourselves the more God will think upon us.

II\. The less we put trust in ourselves the more we may trust in God for
help and deliverance.

III\. The less delay in prayer and active efforts the sooner God will
appear for us.

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Whole Psalm

David's Psalm, or, a Psalm of David; but David's name is here set first,
which elsewhere commonly is last: or, A Psalm concerning David, that is,
Christ, who is called David in the prophets: [Hos
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005.md); [Jer
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#009.md); [Eze
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023.md), and [Eze
32:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#024.md). Of him this Psalm entreateth as
the apostle teacheth, [Heb 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005.md), [Heb
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#006.md), etc. - Henry Ainsworth.

Whole Psalm

It is plain, from [Psa 40:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md) of this
Psalm, compared with [Heb 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005.md), that
the prophet is speaking in the person of Christ, who, [Psa
40:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#001.md), celebrateth the deliverance
wrought for his mystical body, the church, by his resurrection from the
grave, effecting that of his members from the guilt and dominion of sin;
for the abolition of which he declareth, [Psa
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md), the inefficacy of the legal
sacrifices, and mentioneth his own inclination to do the will of his
Father, and [Psa 40:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#009.md), [Psa
40:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#010.md), to preach righteousness to the
world. [Psa 40:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#011.md). He representeth
himself as praying, while under his sufferings, for his own, and his
people's salvation; he foretelleth, [Psa
40:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#014.md), [Psa
40:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#015.md), the confusion and desolation of
his enemies, and, [Psa 40:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#016.md), the joy
and thankfulness of his disciples and servants; for the speedy
accomplishment of which, [Psa 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#017.md),
he preferreth a petition. - George Horne.

[Psa 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#001.md)

"I waited patiently for the Lord: and he inclined unto me, and heard my
cry." I see that the Lord, suppose he drifteth and delayeth the effect
of his servant's prayer, and granteth not his desire at the first, yet
he heareth him. I shall give a certain argument, whereby thou may know
that the Lord heareth thee, suppose he delay the effect of thy prayers.
Continuest thou in prayer? Hast thou this strength given thee to
persevere in suiting anything? Thou may be assured he heareth; for this
is one sure argument that he heareth thee, for naturallie our impatience
carrieth us to desperation; our suddenness is so great, speciallie in
spiritual troubles, that we cannot continue in suiting. When thou,
therefore, continues in suiting, thou may be sure that this strength is
furnished of God, and cometh from heaven, and if thou have strength he
letteth thee see that he heareth thy prayer; and suppose he delay the
effect and force thereof, yet pray continuallie. This doctrine is so
necessary for the troubled conscience, that I think it is the meetest
bridle in the Scripture to refrain our impatience; it is the meetest bit
to hold us in continual exercise of patience; for if the heart
understand that the Lord hath rejected our prayer altogether, it is not
possible to continue in prayer; so when we know that the Lord heareth
us, suppose he delay, let us crave patience to abide his good will. -
Robert Bruce, 1559-1631.

[Psa 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#001.md)

"I waited for the Lord." The infinite קוּה being placed first brings the
action strongly out: I waited. This strong emphasis on the waiting, has
the force of an admonition; it suggests to the sufferer that everything
depends on waiting. - E. W. Hengstenberg.

[Psa 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#001.md)

"I waited patiently'" rather anxiously; the original has it, waiting I
waited; a Hebraism, which signifies vehement solicitude. - Daniel
Cresswell.

[Psa 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#001.md)

"I waited." The Saviour endured his sufferings waitingly, as well as
patiently and prayerfully. He "waited for the Lord." He expected help
from Jehovah; and he waited for it until it came. - James Frame, in
"Christ and his Work: an Exposition of Psalm XL." 1869.

[Psa 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#001.md)

"Patiently." Our Lord's patience under suffering was an element of
perfection in his work. Had he become impatient as we often do, and lost
heart, his atonement would have been vitiated. Well may we rejoice that
in the midst of all his temptations, and in the thickest of the battle
against sin and Satan, he remained patient and willing to finish the
work which his Father had given him to do. - James Frame.

[Psa 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#001.md)

"Heard my cry." Oar Saviour endured his sufferings prayerfully as well
as patiently. - James Frame.

[Psa 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#002.md)

"An horrible pit." Some of the pits referred to in the Bible were
prisons, one such I saw at Athens, and another at Rome. To these there
were no openings, except a hole at the top, which served for both door
and window The bottoms of these pits were necessarily in a filthy and
revolting state, and sometimes deep in mud. "He brought me up also out
of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay;" one of these filthy prisons
being in the Psalmist's view, in [Isa
38:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#017.md), called "the pit of corruption,"
or putrefaction and filth. - John Gadsby.

[Psa 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#002.md)

"An horrible pit;" or, as it is in the Hebrew, a pit of noise; so called
because of waters that falling into it, with great violence, make a
roaring dreadful noise; or because of the strugglings and outcries they
make that are in it; or because when anything is cast into deep pits, it
will always make a great noise; and where he stuck fast in "miry clay,"
without a seeming possibility of getting out. And some refer this to the
greatness of Christ's terrors and sufferings, and his deliverance from
them both. - Arthur Jackson.

[Psa 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#002.md)

Three things are stated in verse two. First, resurrection as the act of
God, "He brought me up," etc. Secondly, the justification of the name
and title of the Sufferer, "and set my feet upon a rock." Jesus is set
up, as alive from the dead, upon the basis of accomplished truth.
Thirdly, there is his ascension, "He establisheth my goings." The Son of
God having trodden, in gracious and self-renouncing obedience the
passage to the grave, now enters finally as Man the path of life. "He is
gone into heaven," says the Spirit. And again, "He ascended on high, and
led captivity captive." - Arthur Pridham in "Notes and Reflections on
the Psalms," 1869.

[Psa 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#003.md)

"A new song." See Notes on [Psa 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#003.md).

[Psa 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#003.md)

"Many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the Lord." The terms
fear, and hope, or trust, do not seem at first view to harmonise; but
David has not improperly joined them together, for no man will ever
entertain the hope of the favour of God but he whose mind is first
imbued with the fear of God. I understand fear, in general, to mean the
feeling of piety which is produced in us by the knowledge of the power,
equity, and mercy of God. - John Calvin.

[Psa 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#003.md)

"Many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the Lord." First of all
they "see." Their eyes are opened; and their opened eyes see and survey
what they are, where they are, whence they came, and whither they are
going.....When the attention of sinners is really and decisively
arrested by the propitiation of Jesus, not only are their eyes opened to
their various moral relations, not only do they "see" but they "fear"
too. They "see" and "fear." ... Conviction follows illumination.... But
while the sinner only sees and fears, he is but in the initial stage of
conversion, only in a state of readiness to flee from the city of
destruction. He may have set out on his pilgrimage, but he has not yet
reached his Father to receive the kiss of welcome and forgiveness. The
consummating step has not yet been taken. He has seen indeed; he has
feared too: but he still requires to trust, to trust in the Lord, and
banish all his fears. This is the culminating point in the great change;
and, unless this be reached, the other experiences will either die away,
like an untimely blossom, or they will only be fuel to the unquenchable
fire. - James Frame.

[Psa 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#005.md)

"Many, O Lord my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done,"
etc. Behold God in the magnificence and wisdom of the works which his
hands have made, even this immense universe, which is full of his glory.
What art and contrivance! What regularity, harmony, and proportion, are
to be seen in all his productions, in the frame of our own bodies, or
those that are about us! And with what beams of majestic glory do the
sun, moon, and stars proclaim how august and wonderful in knowledge
their Maker is! And ought not all these numberless beauties wherewith
the world is stored, which the minds of inquisitive men are ready to
admire, lead up our thoughts to the great Parent of all things, and
inflame our amorous souls with love to him, who is infinitely brighter
and fairer than them all?

Cast abroad your eyes through the nations, and meditate on the mighty
acts which he hath done, and the wisdom and power of his providence,
which should charm all thy affections. Behold his admirable patience,
with what pity he looks down on obstinate rebels; and how he is moved
with compassion when he sees his creatures polluted in their blood, and
bent upon their own destruction; how long he waits to be gracious; how
unwillingly he appears to give up with sinners, and execute deserved
vengeance on his enemies; and then with what joy he pardons for "with
him is plenteous redemption." And what can have more force than these to
win thy esteem, and make a willing conquest of thy heart? so that every
object about thee is an argument of love, and furnishes fuel for this
sacred fire. And whether you behold God in the firmament of his power,
or the sanctuary of his grace, you cannot miss to pronounce him
"altogether lovely." - William Dunlop.

[Psa 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#005.md)

"Thy thoughts which are to us-ward, they cannot be reckoned up in order
unto thee:" i.e., there is no one can digest them in order; for although
that may be attempted according to the comprehension and meaning of men,
yet not before thee, every attempt of that nature being infinitely
beneath thy immeasurable glory. - Victorinus Bythner's "Lyre of David;"
translated by T. Dee: new edition, by N. L. Benmohel, 1847.

[Psa 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#005.md)

"Us-ward." It is worthy of notice that while addressing his Father, as
Jehovah and his God, our Saviour speaks of the members o the human
family as his fellows. This is implied in the expressions "to us-ward."
He regarded himself as most intimately associated with the children of
men. - James Frame.

[Psa 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#005.md)

"They cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee." They are "in order" in
themselves, and if they could be "reckoned up" as they are, they would
be "reckoned in order." Created mind may not be able to grasp the
principle of order that pervades them, but such a principle there is.
And the more we study the whole series in its interrelations, the more
shall we be convinced that as to time and place all the preparations for
the mediatorial work of Christ, all the parts of its accomplishment, and
all the divinely appointed consequents of its acceptation throughout all
time into eternity, are faultlessly in order; they are precisely what
and where and when they should be. - James Frame.

[Psa 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#005.md)

"They are more than can be numbered." The pulses of providence are
quicker than those of our wrists or temples. The soul of David knew
right well their multiplicity, but could not multiply them aright by any
skill in arithmetic; nay, the very sum or chief heads of divine
kindnesses were innumerable. His "wonderful works" and "thoughts"
towards him could not be reckoned up in order by him, they were more
than could be numbered. - Samuel Lee (1625-1691), in "The Triumph of
Mercy in the Chariot of Praise."

[Psa 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#005.md)

It is Christ's speech, of whom the Psalm is made, and that relating unto
his Father's resolved purposes and contrivements from eternity, and
those continued unto his sending Christ into the world to die for us, as
[Psa 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md), [Psa
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007.md). It follows so, as although his
thoughts and purposes were but one individual act at first, and never to
be altered; yet they became many, through a perpetuated reiteration of
them, wherein his constancy to himself is seen.... My brethren, if God
have been thinking thoughts of mercy from everlasting to those that are
his, what a stock and treasury do these thoughts arise to, besides those
that are in his nature and disposition! This is in his actual purposes
and intentions, which he hath thought, and doth think over, again and
again, every moment. "Many, O Lord my God, are thy wonderful works which
thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward," saith Jesus
Christ; for Psalm 40 is a Psalm of Christ, and quoted by the apostle,
and applied unto Christ in Heb. 10, "How many are thy thoughts to
us-ward!" - he speaks it in the name of the human nature - that is, to
me and mine. "If I would declare and speak of them, they are more than
can be numbered." And what is the reason? Because God hath studied
mercies, mercies for his children, even from everlasting. And then, "He
reneweth his mercies every morning;" not that any mercies are new, but
he actually thinketh over mercies again and again, and so he brings out
of his treasury, mercies both new and old, and the old are always new.
What a stock, my brethren, must this needs amount unto! - Thomas
Goodwin.

[Psa 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md)

"Sacrifice and offering.... burnt-offering and sin-offering." Four kinds
are here specified, both by the Psalmist and apostle: namely, sacrifice,
זבח zebhach, θνσία; offering, מגחה minchah, προσφορὰ; burnt-offering,
עולה olah, ὁλοκαύτωμα; sin-offering, חטאה chataah, περὶ ἁμαρτίας. Of all
these we may say with the apostle, it was impossible that the blood of
bulls and goats, etc., should take away sin. - Adam Clarke.

[Psa 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md)

"Mine ears hast thou opened." The literal translation is, mine ears hast
thou digged (or pierced) through; which may well be interpreted as
meaning, "Thou hast accepted me as thy slave," in allusion to the custom
([Exo 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#006).md) of masters boring the ear
of a slave, who had refused his offered freedom, in token of retaining
him. - Daniel Cresswell.

[Psa 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md)

John Calvin, in treating upon the interpretation, "mine ears hast thou
bored," says, "this mode of interpretation appears to be too forced and
refined."

[Psa 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md)

"Mine ears hast thou opened." If it be said that the apostle to the
Hebrews read this differently, I answer, this does not appear to me. It
is true, he found a different, but corrupted translation ( ὠτία ears, as
the learned have observed, having been changed into σῶμα, body) in the
lxx, which was the version then in use; and he was obliged to quote it
as he found it, under the penalty, if he altered it, of being deemed a
false quoter. He therefore took the translation as he found it,
especially as it served to illustrate his argument equally well. Upon
this quotation from the lxx the apostle argues, [Heb
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#009), "He (Christ.md) taketh away the
first (namely, legal sacrifices), that he may establish the second"
(namely, obedience to God's will), in offering himself a sacrifice for
the sins of mankind; and thus he must have argued upon a quotation from
the Hebrew text as it stands at present. - Green, quoted in S. Burder's
"Scripture Expositor."

[Psa 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md)

The apostle's reading ([Heb 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005).md),
though it be far distant from the letter of the Hebrew, and in part from
the lxx (as I suppose it to have been originally), yet is the most
perspicuous interpretation of the meaning of it: Christ's body
comprehended the ears, and that assumed on purpose to perform in it the
utmost degree of obedience to the will of God, to be obedient even to
death, and thereby to be as the priest. - Henry Hammond.

[Psa 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md)

Nor sacrifice thy love can win,

Nor offerings from the stain of sin

Obnoxious man shall clear:

Thy hand my mortal frame prepares,

(Thy hand, whose signature it bears,)

And opes my willing ear.

James Merrick, M.A., 1720-1769.

[Psa 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md), [Psa
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007.md)

In these words an allusion is made to a custom of the Jews to bore the
ears of such as were to be their perpetual servants, and to enrol their
names in a book, or make some instrument of the covenant. "Sacrifice and
burnt-offering thou wouldst not have;" but because I am thy vowed
servant, bored with an awl, and enrolled in thy book, "I said, Lo, I
come; I delight to do thy will, O my God." These words of the Psalm are
alleged by S. Paul, Heb 10. But the first of them with a most strange
difference. For whereas the Psalmist hath, according to the Hebrew
verity, "Sacrifice and burnt-offering thou wouldst not: mine ears thou
hast bored or digged,"; S. Paul reads with the lxx, σῶμα κατηρτίσω μοι,
"A body thou hast prepared or fitted me." What equipollency can be in
sense between these two? This difficulty is so much the more augmented
because most interpreters make the life of the quotation to lie in those
very words where the difference is, namely, That the words, "A body thou
hast prepared me," are brought by the apostle to prove our Saviour's
incarnation; whereunto the words in the Psalm itself ("Mine ears hast
thou bored, or digged, or opened" ), take them how you will, will in no
wise suit. I answer, therefore, That the life of the quotation lies not
in the words of difference, nor can do, because this epistle was written
to the Hebrews, and so first in the Hebrew tongue, where this
translation of the lxx could have no place. And if the life of the
quotation lay here, I cannot see how it can possibly be reconciled. It
lies therefore in the words where there is no difference, namely, That
Christ was such a High Priest as came to sanctify us, not with legal
offerings and sacrifices, but by his obedience in doing like a devoted
servant the will of his Father. Thus, the allegation will not depend at
all upon the words of difference, and so they give us liberty to
reconcile them: "Mine ears hast thou bored," saith the Psalmist, i.e.,
Thou hast accepted me for a perpetual servant, as masters are wont,
according to the law, to bore such servants' ears as refuse to part from
them. Now the lxx, according to whom the apostle's epistle readeth,
thinking perhaps the meaning of this speech would be obscure to such as
knew not that custom, chose rather to translate it generally σῶμα δὲ
κατηρτίσω μοι"Thou hast fitted my body," namely, to be thy servant in
such a manner as servants' bodies are wont to be. And so the sense is
all one, though not specified to the Jewish custom of boring the ear
with an awl, but left indifferently appliable to the custom of any
nation in marking and stigmatising their servants' bodies. - Joseph
Mede, B.D., 1586-1638.

[Psa 40:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md)

Here we have in Christ for our instruction, and in David also (his type)
for our example; 1. A firm purpose of obedience, in a bored ear, and a
yielding heart. 2. A ready performance thereof: "Lo, I come." 3. A
careful observance of the word written: "In the volume of the book it is
written of me," [Psa 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007.md). 4. A hearty
delight in that observance, [Psa 40:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#008.md).
5. A public profession and communication of God's goodness to others,
[Psa 40:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#009.md), [Psa
40:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#010.md). Now, we should labour to
express Christ to the world, to walk as he walked ([Jo1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#006).md): our lives should be in some
sense parallel with his life, as the transcript with the original: he
left us a copy to write by, saith Saint Peter, 1st Epistle [Pe1
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#021.md). - John Trapp.

[Psa 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007.md)

"Then said I, Lo, I come." As his name is above every name, so this
coming of his is above every coming. We sometimes call our own births, I
confess, a coming into the world; but properly, none ever came into the
world but he. For, 1. He only truly can be said to come, who is before
he comes; so were not we, only he so. 2. He only strictly comes who
comes willingly; our crying and struggling at our entrance into the
world, shows how unwillingly we come into it. He alone it is that sings
out, "Lo, I come." 3. He only properly comes who comes from some place
or other. Alas! we had none to come from but the womb of nothing. He
only had a place to be in before he came. - Mark Frank.

[Psa 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007.md)

"Then said I, Lo, I come," to wit, as surety, to pay the ransom, and to
do thy will, O God. Every word carrieth a special emphasis as, 1. The
time, "then," even so soon as he perceived that his Father had prepared
his body for such an end, then, without delay. This speed implieth
forwardness and readiness; he would lose no opportunity. 2. His
profession in this word, "said I;" he did not closely, secretly,
timorously, as being ashamed thereof, but he maketh profession
beforehand. 3. This note of observation, "Lo," this is a kind of calling
angels and men to witness, and a desire that all might know his inward
intention, and the dispositon of his heart; wherein was as great a
willingness as any could have to anything. 4. An offering of himself
without any enforcement or compulsion; this he manifesteth in this word,
"I come." 5. That very instant set out in the present tense, "I come;"
he puts it not off to a future and uncertain time, but even in that
moment, he saith, "I come." 6. The first person twice expressed, thus,
"I said," "I come." He sendeth not another person, nor substituteth any
in his room; but he, even he himself in his own person, cometh. All
which do abundantly evidence Christ's singular readiness and
willingness, as our surety, to do his Father's will, though it were by
suffering, and by being made a sacrifice for our sins. - Thomas Brooks.

[Psa 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007.md)

"Lo, I come," i.e., to appear before thee; a phrase used to indicate the
coming of an inferior into the presence of a superior, or of a slave
before his master, [Num 22:38](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#038.md); [Sa2
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#020.md) : as in the similar expression,
"Behold, here I am," generally expressive of willingness. - J. J.
Stewart Perowne.

[Psa 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007.md)

"Lo, I come." Christ's coming in the spirit is a joyful coming. I think
this, "Lo, I come," expresses, 1. Present joy. 2. It expresses certain
joy: the "Lo," is a note of certainty; the thing is certain and true;
and his joy is certain; certain, true, solid joy. 3. It expresses
communicative joy; designing his people shall share of his joy, "Lo, I
come!" The joy that Christ has as Mediator is a fulness of joy, designed
for his people's use, that out of his fulness we mall receive, and grace
for grace, and joy for joy; grace answering grace in Jesus, and joy
answering joy in him. 4. It expresses solemn joy. He comes with a
solemnity; "Lo, I come!" according to the council of a glorious Trinity.
Now, when the purpose of heaven is come to the birth, and the decree
breaks forth, and the fulness of time is come, he makes heaven and earth
witness, as it were, to his solemn march on the errand: he says it with
a loud, "Lo!" that all the world of men and angels may notice, "Lo, I
come!" And, indeed, all the elect angels brake forth into joyful songs
of praise at this solemnity; when he came in the flesh, they sang,
"Glory to God in the highest, peace on earth, and goodwill towards man."
- Ralph Erskine, 1685-1752.

[Psa 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007.md)

"Lo, I come," or, am come, to wit, into the world ([Heb
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005).md), and particularly to Jerusalem,
to give myself a sacrifice for sin. - Henry Ainsworth.

[Psa 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007.md)

"The volume of the book." What book is meant, whether the Scripture, or
the book of life, is not certain, probably the latter. - W. Wilson, D.D.

[Psa 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007.md)

"The volume of the book." But what volume of manuscript roll is here
meant? Plainly, the one which was already extant when the Psalmist was
writing. If the Psalmist was David himself (as the title of the Psalm
seems to affirm), the only parts of the Hebrew Scriptures then extant,
and of course, the only part to which he could refer, must have been the
Pentateuch, and perhaps the book of Joshua. Beyond any reasonable doubt,
then, the κεφαλὶς βιβίον(מגלּת ספד) was the Pentateuch.... But I
apprehend the meaning of the writer to be, that the book of the law,
which prescribes sacrifices that were merely σκιαὶor παραβολαὶof the
great atoning sacrifice by Christ, did itself teach, by the use of
these, that something of a higher and better nature was to be looked for
than Levitical rites. In a word, it pointed to the Messiah; or, some of
the contents of the written law had respect to him. - Moses Stuart,
M.A., it. "A Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews," 1851.

[Psa 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007.md)

"The volume of the book," etc. When I first considered [Rom
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#014.md) and other Scriptures in the New
Testament which make the first Adam, and the whole story of him both
before and after, and in his sinning or falling, to be the type and
lively shadow of Christ, the second Adam; likewise observing that the
apostle Paul stands admiring at the greatness of this mystery or
mystical type, the Christ, the second Adam should so wonderfully be
shadowed forth therein, as [Eph 5:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#032.md),
he cries out, "This is a great mystery," which he speaks applying and
fitting some passages about Adam and Eve unto Christ and his church; it
made me more to consider an interpretation of a passage in [Heb
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#007.md), out of [Psa
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007.md), which I before had not only not
regarded, but wholly rejected, as being too like a postil gloss. The
passage is, that "when Christ came into the world," to take our nature
on him, he alleged the reason of it to be the fulfilling of a Scripture
written in "the beginning of God's book," έν καφαλίδι Βιβλίου, so out of
the original the words may be, and are by many interpreters, translated,
though our translation reads them only thus, "In the volume of the book
it is written of me." It is true, indeed, that in the fortieth Psalm,
whence they are quoted, the words in the Hebrew may signify no more than
that in God's book (the manner of writing which was anciently in rolls
of parchment, folded up in a volume) Christ was everywhere written and
spoken of. Yet the word κεφαλις, which out of the Septuagint's
translation the apostle took, signifying, as all know, the beginning of
a book; and we finding such an emphasis set by the apostle in the fifth
chapter of the Ephesians, upon the history of Adam in the beginning of
Genesis, as containing the mystery, yea, the great mystery about Christ,
it did somewhat induce, though not so fully persuade, me to think, that
the Holy Ghost in those words might have some glance at the story of
Adam in the first of the first book of Moses. And withal the rather
because so, the words so understood do intimate a higher and further
inducement to Christ to assume our nature, the scope of the speech, Heb.
10, being to render the reason why he so willingly took man's nature:
not only because God liked not sacrifice and burnt-offering, which came
in but upon occasion of sin, and after the fall, and could not take sins
away, but further, that he was prophesied of, and his assuming a body
prophetically foresignified as in the fortieth Psalm, so even by Adam's
story before the fall, recorded in the very beginning of Genesis, which
many other Scriptures do expressly apply it unto. - Thomas Goodwin.

[Psa 40:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#008.md)

"I delight to do thy will, O my God." The will of God to redeem sinners
by the incarnation and death of Jesus Christ, was most grateful and
pleasing to the very heart of Christ. It is said, [Pro
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#031.md), when he was solacing himself in
the sweetest enjoyment of his Father, whilst he lay in that blessed
bosom of delights, yet the very prospect of this work gave him pleasure,
then his "delights were with the sons of men." And when he was come into
the world, and had endured many abuses and injuries, and was even now
come to the most difficult part of the work; yet, "how am I straitened,
or pained (saith he), till it be accomplished!" [Luk
12:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#050.md). Two things call our thoughts to
stay upon them in this point. First. - The decency of it - why it ought
to be so. 1. - It became Christ to go about this work with cheerfulness
and delight, that thereby he might give his death the nature and
formality of a sacrifice. In all sacrifices you shall find that God had
still a regard, a special respect to the will of the offerer. See [Exo
35:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#005.md), [Exo
35:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#021.md), and [Lev
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#003.md). 2. - It ought to be so in view of
the unity of Christ's will with the Father's. 3. - This was necessary to
commend the love of Jesus Christ to us for whom he gave himself. That he
came into the world to die for us is a mercy of the first magnitude; but
that he came in love to our souls, and underwent all his sufferings with
such willingness for our sakes, this heightens it above all
apprehension. 4. - It was necessary to be so for the regulating of all
our obedience to God, according to this pattern; that seeing and setting
this great example of obedience before us, we might never grudge nor
grumble at any duty or suffering that God should call us to. Secondly. -
Let us consider and examine whence it came to be so pleasant and
acceptable to Jesus Christ, to come into the world and die for poor
sinners. 1. - That in his sufferings there would be made a glorious
display and manifestation of the divine attributes. 2. - Another
delightful prospect Christ had of the fruit of his sufferings, was the
recovery and salvation of all the elect by his death; and though his
sufferings were exceedingly bitter, yet such fruit of them as this was
exceedingly sweet. 3. - Add to this, the glory which would redound to
him from his redeemed ones to all eternity, for it will be the
everlasting employment of the saints in heaven to be ascribing glory,
praise, and honour to the Redeemer. Did Christ find pleasure in
abasement and torment, in suffering and dying for me, and can I find no
pleasure in praying, hearing, meditating, and enjoying the sweet duties
of communion with him? Did he come so cheerfully to die for me, and do I
go so deadheartedly to prayers and sacraments to enjoy fellowship with
him? Was it a pleasure to him to shed his blood, and is it none to me to
apply it, and reap the benefits of it? O let there be no more
grumblings, lazy excuses, shiftings of duty, or dead-hearted and
listless performances of them, after such an example as this. Be ready
to do the will of God, be ye also ready to suffer it. And as to
sufferings for Christ, they should not be grievous to Christians that
know how cheerfully Christ came from the bosom of the Father to die for
them. What have we to leave or lose, in comparison with him? What are
our sufferings to Christ's. Alas! there is no compare; there was more
bitterness in one drop of his sufferings than in a sea of ours. To
conclude: your delight and readiness in the paths of obedience is the
very measure of your sanctification. - Condensed from John Flavel.

[Psa 40:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#008.md)

Now, saith Christ, "I delight to do thy will, O my God;" it is the joy
and rejoicing of my heart to be a-seeking and a-saving lost sinners.
When Christ was an hungry, he went not into a victualling house but into
the temple, and taught the people most part of the day, to show how much
he delighted in the salvation of sinners, etc. Christ did so much
delight, and his heart was so much set upon the conversion and salvation
of the Samaritans, that he neglected his own body to save their souls,
as you may clearly see in John 4. - Thomas Brooks.

[Psa 40:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#008.md)

"To do." It was Jesus who was the doer of the work. The Father willed
it; but he did not do it. It was Jesus who did it, who wrought it out;
who brought it in; who carried it within the veil, and laid it as an
acceptable and meritorious offering at the feet of his well-pleased
Father. The work then is done; it is finished. We need not attempt to do
it. We cannot do it. We cannot do that which is already done; and we
could not do it, though it were yet undone. There is much that man can
do, but he cannot make a propitiation. - James Frame.

[Psa 40:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#008.md)

"Thy will." The covenant between the Father and the Son, as elsewhere,
so it is most clearly expressed ([Heb
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#007.md), from [Psa
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007.md), [Psa
40:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#008).md), "Lo, I come: in the volume of
the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, O my God." And
what will? [Heb 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#010.md), "The will by
which we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ
once for all." The will of God was, that Jesus should be offered; and to
this end, that we might be sanctified and saved. It is called "The
offering of the body of Jesus Christ," in answer to what was said
before, "A body hast thou prepared me," or a human nature, by a
synecdoche. "My will," says God the Father, "is that thou have a body,
and that thy body be offered up; and all to this end, that the children,
the elect, might be sanctified." Says the Son to this, "Lo, I come to do
thy will;" - "I accept of the condition, and give up myself to the
performance of thy will." - John Owen.

[Psa 40:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#008.md)

"Thy law is within my heart." The law of God is not to be kept in books,
but in the midst of our hearts, that we may rightly understand the same,
admire it, and observe it. - Martin Geier.

[Psa 40:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#008.md)

"Thy law is within my heart." The will of God in which Christ delighted,
was (as appears by the coherence, and the quotation of [Heb
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005).md) that Christ should make his soul
an offering for sin, as more acceptable to God than all other
burnt-offerings and sin-offerings. This law was in his heart, בּתוך מע,
in the midst of his bowels. He did as much delight in it as we do in
following those inclinations which nature has implanted in our hearts,
as we do in eating and drinking. So he expresses it ([Joh
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#034).md), "My meat is to do the will of
him that sent me, and to finish his work." He was as willing to bleed
and die for thee as thou art to eat when hungry. He was delighted as
much to be scourged, wounded, crucified, as thou delightest in meat when
most delicious. - David Clarkson.

"Within my heart," margin, my bowels. The intestines or viscera are here
mentioned as the place of the most profound spiritual occupation. -
Franz Delitzsch.

[Psa 40:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#009.md)

"I have preached righteousness," etc. It is Jesus who speaks, and he
speaks of himself as a preacher. He was a preacher, and a great preacher
too. He was great - 1. In genuine eloquence. All the handmaids of the
choicest rhetoric ministered to him as he spake. His mind touched the
minds of his auditors on all sides. 2. He was great in knowledge. Many
who have an astonishing command of words, and who can use their words
with astonishing rhetorical adroitness, spoil their influence by their
"lack of knowledge." They go blunderingly onward when they attempt to
think for themselves, or to guide their hearers into fields of thought
which have not been tracked by minds of the pioneer order. 3. He was
great also in goodness. There is a greatness in goodness, and the
greatness of goodness is an important element in the greatness of a
preacher. 4. Jesus was great, too, in official status. Official status,
whether in things civil, literary, or sacred, when conferred on worthy
individuals, confers, in its turn, undoubted weight and moral authority.
Now Jesus was the highest official in the universe. His authority
extended to all other office-bearers, his office exceeded all other
offices. He came from above, and was "above all." He was Lord of lords,
and King of kings. 5. Another element still in the greatness of Jesus,
as a preacher, consisted in the greatness of his essential dignity. He
was God as well as man. Such was Christ as a preacher. True he was more
than a preacher; he was likewise a pattern, and a priest, and a
propitiator; and as pattern, priest, and propitiator, he stands without
a peer. But he was a preacher, too, and as a preacher, he has never had,
and never will have an equal. - Condensed from James Frame.

"I have published.... I would not refrain.... I have not covered... I

The true way of justification of sinners by faith is a jewel so precious
and necessary for poor souls, that it should not be concealed: "I have
not hid thy righteousness within my heart." One sermon on this subject
is not sufficient; it is necessary to make this mystery plain, how by
faith in Christ the man that flieth to him is justified from his sins,
and saved according to the covenant passed between the suffering
Mediator and God the faithful promiser, to justify and save by his own
way. "I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation." - David
Dickson.

"Thy." The adding thy to every one of them is emphatical; it was thy
righteousness I had commission to declare, thy faithfulness I had order
to proclaim, thy mercy I had charge to publish; thou weft as much
interested in all that I did as I myself was. I shall be counted false
and a liar, thou wilt be counted unjust and cruel, if all be not
fulfilled as I have spoken. Since it was thy rule I observed, and thy
glory I aimed at in declaring it, disgrace not thyself and me in
refusing the petition of such a suppliant, who believes in my word which
I gave out by thy authority. - Stephen Charnock.

"I have not hid." This intimates, that whoever undertook to preach the

in Lange's "Bibelwerk," 1869.

[Psa 40:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#011.md)

"Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me." Do not hinder them from
coming showering down upon me. "Let thy lovingkindness and thy truth
continually preserve me;" or, do thou employ them in preserving me. -
John Diodati.

[Psa 40:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#012.md)

"For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have
taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than
the hairs of mine head." We lose ourselves when we speak of the sins of
our lives. It may astonish any considering man to take notice how many
sins he is guilty of any one day; how many sins accompany any one single
act; nay, how many bewray themselves in any one religious duty.
Whensoever ye do anything forbidden, you omit the duty at that time
commanded; and whenever you neglect that which is enjoined, the omission
is joined with the acting of something forbidden; so that the sin,
whether omission or commission, is always double; nay, the apostle makes
every sin tenfold. [Jam 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#010.md). That
which seems one to us, according to the sense of the law, and the
account of God, is multiplied by ten. He breaks every command by sinning
directly against one, and so sins ten times at once; besides that swarm
of sinful circumstances and aggravations which surround every act in
such numbers, as atoms use to surround your body in a dusty room; you
may more easily number these than those. And though some count these but
fractions, incomplete sins, yet even from hence it is more difficult to
take an account of their number. And, which is more for astonishment,
pick out the best religious duty that ever you performed, and even in
that performance you may find such a swarm of sins as cannot be
numbered. In the best prayer that ever you put up to God, irreverence,
lukewarmness, unbelief, spiritual pride, self-seeking, hypocrisy,
distractions, etc., and many more, that an enlightened soul grieves and
bewails; and yet there are many more that the pure eye of God discerns,
than any man does take notice of. - David Clarkson.

[Psa 40:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#012.md)

"Mine iniquities have taken hold upon me." They seized him as the
sinner's substitute, to deal with him as regards their own penalty,
according to the sinner's desert. - James Frame.

[Psa 40:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#013.md)

The remaining verses of this Psalm are almost exactly identical with
[Psa 70:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#001.md).

[Psa 40:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#014.md)

"Let them be ashamed and confounded," etc. Even this prayer carried
benevolence in its bosom. It sought from the divine Father, such a
manifestation of what was glorious and God-like as might unnerve each
rebel arm, and overawe each rebel heart in the traitor's company. If
each arm were for a little unnerved, if each heart were for a
little,unmanned, there might be time for the better principles of their
nature to rise and put an arrest upon the prosecution of' their wicked
design. Such being the benevolent aim of the prayer, we need not wonder
that it issued from the same heart that by-and-by exclaimed, "Father,
forgive them, for they know not what they do;" neither need we marvel
that it was answered to the very letter, and that as soon as he said to
the traitor band, "I am he," they went backward and fell to the ground.
- James Frame.

[Psa 40:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#015.md)

"Aha, aha." An exclamation which occurs three times in the Psalms; and
in each case there seems to be reference to the mockery at the Passion.
See [Psa 35:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#021.md); and [Psa
70:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#003.md), which appear to belong to the
same time as the present Psalm. - Christopher Wordsworth.

[Psa 40:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#016.md)

"Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee." As every
mercy to every believer giveth a proof of God's readiness to show the
like mercy to all believers, when they stand in need; so should every
mercy shown to any of the number, being known to the rest, be made the
matter and occasion of magnifying the Lord. - David Dickson.

[Psa 40:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#016.md)

"Such as love thy salvation." To love God's salvation is to love God
himself, the Saviour, or Jesus. - Martin Geier.

[Psa 40:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#016.md)

"Such as love thy salvation." One would think that self-love alone
should make us love salvation. Ay, but they love it because it is his,
"that love thy salvation." It is the character of a holy saint to love
salvation itself; not as his own only, but as God's, as God's that saves
him. - Thomas Goodwin.

[Psa 40:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#016.md)

"Let such as love thy salvation say continually, The Lord be magnified."
Jesus who gave us our capacity of happiness and our capacity of
speaking, realised the relation which he had established between them;
and hence in praying for his friends, he prayed that in the joy and
gladness of their souls they might sail, "The Lord be magnified." He
desired them to speak of their holy happiness; and it was his wish that
when they did speak of it they should speak in terms of laudation of
Jehovah, for he was the source of it. He desired them to say
continually, "The Lord be magnified." - James Frame.

[Psa 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#017.md)

In Dr. Malan's memoir, the editor, one of his sons, thus writes of his
brother Jocelyn, who was for some years prior to his death, the subject
of intense bodily sufferings: - "One striking feature in his character
was his holy fear of God, and reverence for his will. One day I was
repeating a verse from the Psalms, 'As for me, I am poor and needy, but
the Lord careth for me: thou art my helper and deliverer; O Lord, make
no long tarrying.' He said, "Mamma, I love that verse, all but the last
bit, it looks like a murmur against God. He never 'tarries' in my case."
- From "The Life, Labours, and Writings of Caesar Malan (1787-1864): By
one of his sons," 1689.

[Psa 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#017.md)

"Yet the Lord thinketh upon me." Sacred story derives from heaven the
kindness of Abimelech to Abraham, of Laban and Esau to Jacob, of Ruth to
Naomi, of Boaz to Ruth, and Jonathan to David. When others think of
kindness to us, let us imitate David, 'tis the Lord that thinketh upon
me, and forms those thoughts within their hearts. This should calm our
spirits when a former friend's heart is alienated by rash admissions of
false suggestions, or when any faithful Jonathan expires his spirit into
the bosom of God. It should not be lost what Hobson, the late noted
carrier of Cambridge, said to a young student receiving a letter of the
sad tidings of his uncle's decease (who maintained him at the
University), and weeping bitterly, and reciting the cause of his grief,
he replied, Who gave you that friend? Which saying did greatly comfort
him, and was a sweet support to him afterwards in his ministry. The
Everliving God is the portion of a living faith, and he can never want
that hath such an ocean. He that turns the hearts of kings like rivers
at his pleasure, turns all the little brooks in the world into what
scorched and parched ground he pleases. - Samuel Lee.

[Psa 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#017.md)

"The Lord thinketh upon me." There are three things in God's thinking
upon us, that are solacing and delightful. Observe the frequency of his
thoughts. Indeed, they are incessant. You have a friend, whom you esteem
and love. You wish to live in his mind. You say when you part, and when
you write, "Think of me." You give him, perhaps, a token to revive his
remembrance. How naturally is Selkirk, in his solitary island, made to
say:

"My friends, do they now and then send

A wish or a thought after me?

O tell me, I yet have a friend,

Though a friend I am never to see.

Ye winds, that have made me your sport,

Convey to this desolate shore

Some cordial, endearing report.

Of a land I shall visit no more."

But the dearest connexion in the world cannot be always thinking upon
you. Half his time he is in a state of unconsciousness; and how much
during the other half, is he engrossed! But there is no remission in the
Lord's thoughts.... Observe in the next place, the wisdom of his
thoughts. You have a dear child, absent from you, and you follow him in
your mind. But you know not his present circumstances. You left him in
such a place; but where is he now? You left him in such a condition. But
what is he now? Perhaps, while you are thinking upon his health, he is
groaning under a bruised limb, or a painful disorder. Perhaps, while you
are thinking of his safety, some enemy is taking advantage of his
innocency. Perhaps, while you are rejoicing in his prudence, he is going
to take a step that will involve him for life. But when God thinketh
upon you, he is perfectly acquainted with your situation, your dangers,
your wants. He knows all your walking through this great wilderness, and
can afford you the seasonable succour you need. For again, observe the
efficiency of his thoughts. You think upon another, and you are anxious
to guide, or defend, or relieve him. But in how many cases can you think
only? Solicitude cannot control the disease of the body, cannot
dissipate the melancholy of the mind. But with God all things are
possible. He who thinks upon you is a God at hand and not afar off; he
has all events under his control; he is the God of all grace. If,
therefore, he does not immediately deliver, it is not because he is
unable to redress, but because he is waiting to be gracious. - William
Jay.

[Psalms 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 40:1</span></span>

1 I waited patiently for the Lord; and he inclined unto me, and heard my
cry.

2 He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay,
and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.

3 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many
shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the Lord.

[Psa 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#001.md)

"I waited patiently for the Lord." Patient waiting upon God was a
special characteristic of our Lord Jesus. Impatience never lingered in
his heart, much less escaped his lips. All through his agony in the
garden, his trial of cruel mockings before Herod and Pilate, and his
passion on the tree, he waited in omnipotence of patience. No glance of
wrath, no word of murmuring, no deed of vengeance came from God's
patient Lamb; he waited and waited on; was patient, and patient to
perfection, far excelling all others who have according to their measure
glorified God in the fires. Job on the dunghill does not equal Jesus on
the cross. The Christ of God wears the imperial crown among the patient.
Did the Only Begotten wait, and shall we be petulant and rebellious?
"And he inclined unto me, and heard my cry." Neither Jesus the head, nor
any one of the members of his body, shall ever wait upon the Lord in
vain. Mark the figure of inclining, as though the suppliant cried out of
the lowest depression, and condescending love stooped to hear his feeble
moans. What a marvel is it that our Lord should have to cry as we do,
and wait as we do, and should receive the Father's help after the same
process of faith and pleading as must be gone through by ourselves! The
Saviour's prayers among the midnight mountains and in Gethsemane expound
this verse. The Son of David was brought very low, but he rose to
victory; and here he teaches us how to conduct our conflicts so as to
succeed after the same glorious pattern of triumph. Let us arm ourselves
with the same mind; and panoplied in patience, armed with prayer, and
girt with faith, let us maintain the Holy War.

[Psa 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#002.md)

"He brought me up also out of an horrible pit." When our Lord bore in
his own person the terrible curse which was due to sin, he was so cast
down as to be like a prisoner in a deep, dark, tearful dungeon, amid
whose horrible glooms the captive heard a noise as of rushing torrents,
while overhead resounded the tramp of furious foes. Our Lord in his
anguish was like a captive in the oubliettes, forgotten of all mankind,
immured amid horror, darkness, and desolation. Yet the Lord Jehovah made
him to ascend from all his abasement; he retraced his steps from that
deep hell of anguish into which he had been cast as our substitute. He
who thus delivered our surety in extremis, will not fail to liberate us
form our far lighter griefs. "Out of the miry clay." The sufferer was as
one who cannot find a foothold, but slips and sinks. The figure
indicates not only positive misery as in the former figure, but the
absence of solid comfort by which sorrow might have been rendered
supportable. Once give a man good foothold, and a burden is greatly
lightened, but to be loaded and to be placed on slimy, slippery clay, is
to be tried doubly. Reader, with humble gratitude, adore the dear
Redeemer who, for thy sake, was deprived of all consolation while
surrounded with every form of misery; remark his gratitude at being
upborne amid his arduous labours and sufferings, and if thou too hast
experienced the divine help, be sure to join thy Lord in this song. "And
set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings." The Redeemer's work
is done. He reposes on the firm ground of his accomplished engagements;
he can never suffer again; for ever does he reign in glory. What a
comfort to know that Jesus our Lord and Saviour stands on a sure
foundation in all that he is and does for us, and his goings forth in
love are not liable to be cut short by failure in years to come, for God
has fixed him firmly. He is for ever and eternally able to save unto the
uttermost them that come unto God by him, seeing that in the highest
heavens he ever liveth to make intercession for them. Jesus is the true
Joseph taken from the pit to be Lord of all. It is something more than a
"sip of sweetness" to remember that if we are cast like our Lord into
the lowest pit of shame and sorrow, we shall by faith rise to stand on
the same elevated, sure, and everlasting rock of divine favour and
faithfulness.

[Psa 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#003.md)

"And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God." At
the passover, before his passion, our Lord sang one of the grand old
Psalms of praise; but what is the music of his heart now, in the midst
of his redeemed! What a song is that in which his glad heart for ever
leads the chorus of the elect! Not Miriam's tabour nor Moses' triumphant
hymn o'er Mizraim's chivalry can for a moment rival that ever new and
exulting song. Justice magnified and grace victorious; hell subdued and
heaven glorified; death destroyed and immortality established; sin
o'erthrown and righteousness resplendent; what a theme for a hymn in
that day when our Lord drinketh the red wine new with us all in our
heavenly Father's kingdom! Even on earth, and before his great passion,
he foresaw the joy which was set before him, and was sustained by the
prospect. "Our God." The God of Jesus, the God of Israel, "my God and
your God." How will we praise him, but, ah! Jesus will be the chief
player on our stringed instruments; he will lead the solemn hallelujah
which shall go up from the sacramental host redeemed by blood. "Many
shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the Lord." A multitude that
no man can number shall see the griefs and triumphs of Jesus, shall
tremble because of their sinful rejection of him, and then through grace
shall receive faith and become trusters in Jehovah. Here is our Lord's
reward. Here is the assurance which makes preachers bold and workers
persevering. Reader, are you one among the many? Note the way of
salvation, a sight, a fear, a trust! Do you know what these mean by
possessing and practising them in your own soul? Trusting in the Lord is
the evidence nay the essence of salvation. He who is a true believer is
evidently redeemed from the dominion of sin and Satan.

[Psalms 40:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 40:4</span></span>

4 Blessed is that man that maketh the Lord his trust, and respecteth not
the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.

5 Many, O Lord my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done, and
thy thoughts which are to us-ward they cannot be reckoned up in order
unto thee: if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can
be numbered.

[Psa 40:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#004.md)

"Blessed." This is an exclamation similar to that of the[Psa
1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md), "Oh, the happiness of the man."
God's blessings are emphatic, "I wot that he whom thou blessest is
blessed," indeed and in very truth. "Is that man that maketh the Lord
his trust." Faith obtaineth promises. A simple, single-eyed confidence
in God is the sure mark of blessedness. A man may be as poor as Lazarus,
as hated as Mordecai, as sick as Hezekiah, as lonely as Elijah, but
while his hand of faith can keep its hold on God, none of his outward
afflictions can prevent his being numbered among the blessed but the
wealthiest and most prosperous man who has no faith is accursed, be he
who he may. "And respecteth not the proud." The proud expect all men to
bow down and do them reverence, as if the worship of the golden calves
were again set up in Israel; but believing mean are too noble to honour
mere money-bags, or cringe before bombastic dignity. The righteous pay
their respect to humble goodness, rather than to inflated
self-consequence. Our Lord Jesus was in this our bright example. No
flattery of kings and great ones ever fell from his lips; he gave no
honour to dishonourable men. The haughty were never his favourites. "Nor
such as turn aside to lies." Heresies and idolatries are lies, and so
are avarice, worldliness, and pleasure-seeking. Woe to those who follow
such deceptions. Our Lord was ever both the truth and the lover of
truth, and the father of lies had no part in him. We must never pay
deference to apostates, time-servers, and false teachers; they are an
ill leaven, and the more we purge ourselves of them the better; they are
blessed whom God preserves from all error in creed and practice. Judged
by this verse, many apparently happy persons must be the reverse of
blessed, for anything in the shape of a purse, a fine equipage, or a
wealthy establishment, commands their reverence, whether the owner be a
rake or a saint, an idiot or a philosopher. Verily, were the arch-fiend
of hell to start a carriage and pair, and live like a lord, he would
have thousands who would court his acquaintance.

[Psa 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#005.md)

"Many, O Lord my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done."
Creation, providence, and redemption, teem with wonders as the sea with
life. Our special attention is called by this passage to the marvels
which cluster around the cross and flash from it. The accomplished
redemption achieves many ends, and compasses a variety of designs; the
outgoing of the atonement are not to be reckoned up, the influences of
the cross reach further than the beams of the sun. Wonders of grace
beyond all enumeration take their rise from the cross; adoption, pardon,
justification, and a long chain of godlike miracles of love proceed from
it. Note that our Lord here speaks of the Lord as "my God." The man
Christ Jesus claimed for himself and us a covenant relationship with
Jehovah. Let our interest in our God be ever to us our peculiar
treasure. "And thy thoughts which are to us-ward." The divine thoughts
march with the divine acts, for it is not according to God's wisdom to
act without deliberation and counsel. All the divine thoughts are good
and gracious towards his elect. God's thoughts of love are very many,
very wonderful very practical! Muse on them, dear reader; no sweeter
subject ever occupied your mind. God's thoughts of you are many, let not
yours be few in return. "They cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee."
Their sum is so great as to forbid alike analysis and numeration. Human
minds fail to measure, or to arrange in order, the Lord's ways and
thoughts; and it must always be so, for he hath said, "As the heavens
are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my
thoughts than your thoughts." No maze to lose oneself in like the
labyrinth of love. How sweet to be outdone, overcome and overwhelmed by
the astonishing grace of the Lord our God! "If I would declare and speak
of them," and surely this should be the occupation of my tongue at all
seasonable opportunities, "they are more than can be numbered;" far
beyond all human arithmetic they are multiplied; thoughts from all
eternity, thoughts of my fall, my restoration, my redemption, my
conversion, my pardon, my upholding, my perfecting, my eternal reward;
the list is too long for writing, and the value of the mercies too great
for estimation. Yet, if we cannot show forth all the works of the Lord,
let us not make this an excuse for silence; for our Lord, who is in this
our best example, often spake of the tender thoughts of the great
Father.

[Psalms 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 40:6</span></span>

6 Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou
opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.

7 Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of
me.

8 I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.

9 I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have
not refrained my lips, O Lord, thou knowest.

10 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy
faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness
and thy truth from the great congregation.

[Psa 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md)

Here we enter upon one of the most wonderful passages in the whole of
the Old Testament, a passage in which the incarnate Son of God is seen
not through a glass darkly, but as it were face to face. "Sacrifice and
offering thou didst not desire." In themselves considered and for their
own sakes the Lord saw nothing satisfactory in the various offerings of
the ceremonial law. Neither the victim pouring forth its blood, nor the
fine flour rising in smoke from the altar, could yield content to
Jehovah's mind; he cared not for the flesh of bulls or of goats, neither
had he pleasure in corn and wine, and oil. Typically these offerings had
their worth, but when Jesus, the Antitype, came into the world, they
ceased to be of value, as candles are of no estimation when the sun has
arisen. "Mine ears hast thou opened." Our Lord was quick to hear and
perform his Father's will; his ears were as if excavated down to his
soul; they were not closed up like Isaac's wells, which the Philistines
filled up, but clear passages down to the fountains of his soul. The
prompt obedience of our Lord is here the first idea. There is, however,
no reason whatever to reject the notion that the digging of the ear here
intended may refer to the boring of the ear of the servant, who refused
out of love to his master to take his liberty at the year of jubilee;
his perforated ear, the token of perpetual service, is a true picture of
our blessed Lord's fidelity to his Father's business, and his love to
his Father's children. Jesus irrevocably gave himself up to be the
servant of servants for our sake and God's glory. The Septuagint, from
which Paul quoted, has translated this passage, "A body hast thou
prepared me:" how this reading arose it is not easy to imagine, but
since apostolical authority has sanctioned the variation, we accept it
as no mistake, but as an instance of various readings equally inspired.
In any case, the passage represents the Only Begotten as coming into the
world equipped for service; and in a real and material body, by actual
life and death, putting aside all the shadows of the Mosaic law. "Burnt
offering and sin offering hast thou not required." Two other forms of
offering are here mentioned; tokens of gratitude and sacrifices for sin
as typically presented are set aside; neither the general nor the
private offerings are any longer demanded. What need of mere emblems
when the substance itself is present? We learn from this verse that
Jehovah values far more the obedience of the heart than all the imposing
performances of ritualistic worship; and that our expiation from sin
comes not to us as the result of an elaborate ceremonial, but as the
effect of our great Substitute's obedience to the will of Jehovah.

[Psa 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007.md)

"Then said I." That is to say, when it was clearly seen that man's
misery could not be remedied by sacrifices and offerings. It being
certain that the mere images of atonement, and the bare symbols' of
propitiation were of no avail, the Lord Jesus, in propria persona,
intervened. O blessed "then said I." Lord, ever give us to hear and feed
on such living words as these, so peculiarly and personally thine own.
"Lo, I come." Behold, O heavens, and thou earth, and ye places under the
earth! Here is something worthy of your intensest gaze. Sit ye down and
watch with earnestness, for the invisible God comes in the likeness of
sinful flesh, and as an infant the Infinite hangs at a virgin's breast!
Immanuel did not send but come; he came in his own personality, in all
that constituted his essential self he came forth from the ivory palaces
to the abodes of misery; he came promptly at the destined hour; he came
with sacred alacrity as one freely offering himself. "In the volume of
the book it is written of me." In the eternal decree it is thus
recorded. The mystic roll of predestination which providence gradually
unfolds, contained within it, to the Saviour's knowledge, a written
covenant, that in the fulness of time the divine I should descend to
earth to accomplish a purpose which hecatombs of bullocks and rams could
not achieve. What a privilege to find our names written in the book of
life, and what an honour, since the name of Jesus heads the page! Our
Lord had respect to his ancient covenant engagements, and herein he
teaches us to be scrupulously just in keeping our word; have we so
promised, is it so written in the book of remembrance? then let us never
be defaulters.

[Psa 40:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#008.md)

"I delight to do thy will, O my God." Our blessed Lord alone could
completely do the will of God. The law is too broad for such poor
creatures as we are to hope to fulfil it to the uttermost: but Jesus not
only did the Father's will, but found a delight therein; from old
eternity he had desired the work set before him; in his human life he
was straitened till he reached the baptism of agony in which he
magnified the law, and even in Gethsemane itself he chose the Father's
will, and set aside his own. Herein is the essence of obedience, namely,
in the soul's cheerful devotion to God: and our Lord's obedience, which
is our righteousness, is in no measure lacking in this eminent quality.
Notwithstanding his measureless griefs, our Lord found delight in his
work, and for "the joy that was set before him he endured the cross,
despising the shame." "Yea, thy law is within my heart." No outward,
formal devotion was rendered by Christ; his heart was in his work,
holiness was his element, the Father's will his meat and drink. We must
each of us be like our Lord in this, or we shall lack the evidence of
being his disciples. Where there is no heart work, no pleasure, no
delight in God's law, there can be no acceptance. Let the devout reader
adore the Saviour for the spontaneous and hearty manner in which he
undertook the great work of our salvation.

[Psa 40:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#009.md)

"I have preached righteousness in the great congregation." The purest
morality and the highest holiness were preached by Jesus. Righteousness
divine was his theme. Our Lord's whole life was a sermon, eloquent
beyond compare, and it is heard each day by myriads. Moreover, he never
shunned in his ministry to declare the whole counsel of God; God's great
plan of righteousness he plainly set forth. He taught openly in the
temple, and was not ashamed to be a faithful and a true witness. He was
the great evangelist; the master of itinerant preachers; the head of the
clan of open-air missionaries. O servants of the Lord, hide not your
lights, but reveal to others what your God has revealed to you; and
especially by your lives testify for holiness, be champions for the
right, both in word and deed. "Lo, I have not refrained my lips, O Lord,
thou knowest." Never either from love of ease, or fear of men, did the
Great Teacher's lips become closed. He was instant in season and out of
season. The poor listened to him, and princes heard his rebuke;
Publicans rejoiced at him, and Pharisees raged, but to them both he
proclaimed the truth from heaven. It is well for a tried believer when
he can appeal to God and call him to witness that he has not been
ashamed to bear witness for him; for rest assured if we are not ashamed
to confess our God he will never be ashamed to own us. Yet what a wonder
is here, that the Son of God should plead just as we plead, and urge
just such arguments as would befit the mouths of his diligent ministers!
How truly is he "made like unto his brethren."

[Psa 40:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#010.md)

"I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart." On the contrary,
"Never man spake like this man." God's divine plan of making men
righteous was well known to him, and he plainly taught it. What was in
our great Master's heart he poured forth in holy eloquence from his
lips. The doctrine of righteousness by faith he spake with great
simplicity of speech. Law and gospel equally found in him a clear
expositor. "I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation."
Jehovah's fidelity to his promises and his grace in saving believers
were declared by the Lord Jesus on many occasions, and are blessedly
blended in the gospel which he came to preach. God, faithful to his own
character, law and threatenings, and yet saving sinners, is a peculiar
revelation of the gospel. God faithful to the saved ones evermore is the
joy of the followers of Christ Jesus. "I have not concealed thy
lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation." The tender as
well as the stern attributes of God, our Lord Jesus fully unveiled.
Concealment was far from the Great Apostle of our profession. Cowardice
he never exhibited, hesitancy never weakened his language. He who as a
child of twelve years spake in the temple among the doctors, and
afterwards preached to five thousand at Gennesaret, and to the vast
crowds at Jerusalem on that great day, the last day of the feast, was
always ready to proclaim the name of the Lord, and could never be
charged with unholy silence. He could be dumb when so the prophecy
demanded and patience suggested, but otherwise, preaching was his meat
and his drink, and he kept back nothing which would be profitable to his
disciples. This in the day of his trouble, according to this Psalm, he
used as a plea for divine aid lie had been faithful to his God, and now
begs the Lord to be faithful to him. Let every dumb professor,
tongue-tied by sinful shame, bethink himself how little he will be able
to plead after this fashion in the day of his distress.

[Psalms 40:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 40:11</span></span>

11 Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O Lord: let thy
lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.

12 For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have
taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than
the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me.

13 Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me: O Lord, make haste to help me.

14 Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul
to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me
evil.

15 Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me,
Aha, aha.

16 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as
love thy salvation say continually, The Lord be magnified.

17 But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou art my
help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.

[Psa 40:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#011.md)

"Withhold not thou try tender mercies from me, O Lord." Alas! these were
to be for awhile withheld from our Lord while on the accursed tree, but
meanwhile in his great agony he seeks for gentle dealing; and the coming
of the angel to strengthen him was a clear answer to his prayer. He had
been blessed aforetime in the desert, and now at the entrance of the
valley of the shadow of death, like a true, trustful, and experienced
man, he utters a holy, plaintive desire for the tenderness of heaven. He
had not withheld his testimony to God's truth, now in return he begs his
Father not to withhold his compassion. This verse might more correctly
be read as a declaration of his confidence that help would not be
refused; but whether we view this utterance as the cry of prayer, or the
avowal of faith, in either case it is instructive to us who take our
suffering Lord for an example, and it proves to us how thoroughly he was
made like unto his brethren. "Let thy lovingkindness and thy truth
continually preserve me." He had preached both of these, and now he asks
for an experience of them, that he might be kept in the evil day and
rescued from his enemies and his afflictions. Nothing endears our Lord
to us more than to hear him thus pleading with strong crying and tears
to him who was able to save. O Lord Jesus, in our nights of wrestling we
will remember thee.

[Psa 40:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#012.md)

"For innumerable evils have compassed me about." On every side he was
beset with evils; countless woes environed the great Substitute for our
sins. Our sins were innumerable, and so were his griefs. There was no
escape for us from our iniquities, and there was no escape for him from
the woes which we deserved. From every quarter evils accumulated about
the blessed One, although in his heart evil found no place. "Mine
iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up."
He had no sin, but sins were laid on him, and he took them as if they
were his. "He was made sin for us." The transfer of sin to the Saviour
was real, and produced in him as man the horror which forbade him to
look into the face of God, bowing him down with crushing anguish and woe
intolerable. O my soul, what would thy sins have done for thee eternally
if the Friend of sinners had not condescended to take them all upon
himself? Oh, blessed Scripture! "The Lord hath made to meet upon him the
iniquity of us all." Oh, marvellous depth of love, which could lead the
perfectly immaculate to stand in the sinner's place, and bear the horror
of great trembling which sin must bring upon those conscious of it.
"They are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth
me." The pains of the divine penalty were beyond compute, and the
Saviour's soul was so burdened with them, that he was sore amazed, and
very heavy even unto a sweat of blood. His strength was gone, his
spirits sank, he was in an agony.

Came at length the dreadful night;

Vengeance with its iron rod

Stood, and with collected might

Bruised the harmless Lamb of God.

See, my soul, thy Saviour see

Prostrate in Gethsemane!

There my God bore all my guilt,

This through grace can be believed;

But the horrors which he felt

Are too vast to be conceived.

None can penetrate through thee,

Doleful, dark Gethsemane!

Sins against a holy God;

Sins against his righteous laws;

Sins against his love, his blood;

Sins against his name and cause;

Sins immense as is the sea -

Hide me, O Gethsemane!"

[Psa 40:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#013.md)

"Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me: O Lord, make haste to help me." How
touching! How humble! How plaintive! The words thrill us as we think
that after this sort our Lord and Master prayed. His petition is not so
much that the cup should pass away undrained, but that he should be
sustained while drinking it, and set free from its power at the first
fitting moment. He seeks deliverance and help; and he entreats that the
help may not be slow in coming; this is after the manner of our
pleadings. Is it not? Note, reader, how our Lord was heard in that he
feared, for there was after Gethsemane a calm endurance which made the
fight as glorious as the victory.

[Psa 40:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#014.md)

"Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to
destroy it." Whether we read this as a prayer or a prophecy it matters
not, for the powers of sin, and death, and hell, may well be ashamed as
they see the result of their malice for ever turned against themselves.
It is to the infinite confusion of Satan that his attempt to destroy the
Saviour destroyed himself; the diabolical conclave who plotted in
council are now all alike put to shame, for the Lord Jesus has met them
at all points, and turned all their wisdom into foolishness. "Let them
be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil." It is even so;
the hosts of darkness are utterly put to the rout, and made a theme for
holy derision for ever and ever. How did they gloat over the thought of
crushing the seed of the woman! but the Crucified has conquered, the
Nazarene has laughed them to scorn, the dying Son of Man has become the
death of death and hell's destruction. For ever blessed be his name.

[Psa 40:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#015.md)

"Let them be desolate," or amazed; even as Jesus was desolate in his
agony, so let his enemies be in their despair when he defeats them. The
desolation caused in the hearts of evil spirits and evil men by envy,
malice, chagrin, disappointment, and despair, shall be a fit recompense
for their cruelty to the Lord when he was in their hands. "For a reward
of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha." Did the foul fiend insult
over our Lord? Behold how shame is now his reward! Do wicked men today
pour shame upon the name of the Redeemer? Their desolation shall avenge
him of his adversaries! Jesus is the gentle Lamb to all who seek mercy
through his blood; but let despisers beware, for he is the Lion of the
tribe of Judah, and "who shall rouse him up?" The Jewish rulers exulted
and scornfully said, "Aha, aha;" but when the streets of Jerusalem ran
like rivers deep with gore, "and the temple was utterly consumed," then
their house was left unto them desolate, and the blood of the last of
the prophets, according to their own desire, came upon themselves and
upon their children. O ungodly reader, if such a person glance over this
page, beware of persecuting Christ and his people, for God will surely
avenge his own elect. Your "ahas" will cost you dear. It is hard for you
to kick against the pricks.

[Psa 40:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#016.md)

"Let all those that seek thee, rejoice and be glad in thee." We have
done with Ebal and turn to Gerizim. Here our Lord pronounces
benedictions on his people. Note who the blessed objects of his
petitions are: not all men, but some men, "I pray for them, I pray not
for the world." He pleads for seekers: the lowest in the kingdom, the
babes of the family; those who have true desires, longing prayers, and
consistent endeavours after God. Let seeking souls pluck up heart when
they hear of this. What riches of grace, that in his bitterest hour
Jesus should remember the lambs of the flock! And what does he entreat
for them? it is that they may be doubly glad, intensely happy,
emphatically joyful, for such the repetition of terms implies. Jesus
would have all seekers made happy by finding what they seek after, and
by winning peace through his grief. As deep as were his sorrows, so high
would he have their joys. He groaned that we might sing, and was covered
with a bloody sweat that we might be anointed with the oil of gladness.
"Let such as love thy salvation say continually, The Lord be magnified."
Another result of the Redeemer's passion is the promotion of the glory
of God by those who gratefully delight in his salvation. Our Lord's
desire should be our directory; we love with all our hearts his great
salvation, let us then, with all our tongues proclaim the glory of God
which is resplendent therein. Never let his praises cease. As the heart
is warm with gladness let it incite the tongue to perpetual praise. If
we cannot do what we would for the spread of the kingdom, at least let
us desire and pray for it. Be it ours to make God's glory the chief end
of every breath and pulse. The suffering Redeemer regarded the
consecration of his people to the service of heaven as a grand result of
his atoning death; it is the joy which was set before him; that God is
glorified is the reward of the Saviour's travail.

[Psa 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#017.md)

"But I am poor and needy." - The man of sorrows closes with another
appeal, based upon his affliction and poverty. "Yet the Lord thinketh
upon me." Sweet was this solace to the holy heart of the great sufferer.
The Lord's thoughts of us are a cheering subject of meditation, for they
are ever kind and never cease. His disciples forsook him, and his
friends forgat him, but Jesus knew that Jehovah never turned away his
heart from him, and this upheld him in the hour of need. "Thou art my
help and my deliverer." His unmoved confidence stayed itself alone on
God. O that all believers would imitate more fully their great Apostle
and High Priest in his firm reliance upon God, even when afflictions
abounded and the light was veiled. "Make no tarrying, O my God." The
peril was imminent, the need urgent, the suppliant could not endure
delay, nor was he made to wait, for the angel came to strengthen, and
the brave heart of Jesus rose up to meet the foe.

Lord Jesus, grant that in all our adversities we may possess like
precious faith, and be found like thee, more than conquerors.
