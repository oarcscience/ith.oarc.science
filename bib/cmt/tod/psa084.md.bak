### [Psalms Chapter 84](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 84:0</span></span>

Title and Subject. - To the chief musician upon Gittith. A Psalm for the
sons of Korah. This Psalm well deserved to be committed to the noblest
of the sons of song. No music could be too sweet for its theme, or too
exquisite in sound to match the beauty of its language. Sweeter than the
joy of the wine press, (for that is said to be the meaning of the word
rendered upon Gittith), is the joy of the holy assemblies of the Lord's
house; not even the favoured children of grace, who are like the sons of
Korah, can have a richer subject for song than Zion's sacred festivals.

It matters little when this Psalm was written, or by whom; for our part
it exhales to us a Davidic perfume, it smells of the mountain heather
and the lone places of the wilderness, where King David must have often
lodged during his many wars. This sacred ode is one of the choicest of
the collection; it has a mild radiance about it, entitling it to be
called The Pearl of Psalms. If the twenty-third be the most popular, the
one-hundred-and-third the most joyful, the one-hundred-and-nineteenth
the most deeply experimental, the fifty-first the most plaintive, this
is one of the most sweet of the Psalms of Peace.

Pilgrimages to the tabernacle were a great feature of Jewish life. In
our own country, pilgrimages to the shrine of Thomas of Canterbury, and
our Ladye of Walsingham, were so general as to affect the entire
population, cause the formation of roads, the erection and maintenance
of hostelries, and the creation of a special literature; this may help
us to understand the influence of pilgrimage upon the ancient
Israelites. Families journeyed together, making bands which grew at each
halting place; they camped in sunny glades, sang in unison along the
roads, toiled together over the hill and through the slough, and, as
they went along, stored up happy memories which would never be
forgotten. One who was debarred the holy company of the pilgrims, and
the devout worship of the congregation, would find in this Psalm fit
expression for his mournful spirit.

Division. - We will make our pauses where the poet or the musician
placed them, namely, at the Selahs.

Hints to Preachers

[Psa 84:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001.md). -

I. Why called Tabernacles? To include

1\. the holiest of all;

2\. The holy place;

3\. The court and precincts of the Tabernacle. "Amiable" is predicated
of these. The courts amiable - the holy place more amiable - the holiest
of all most amiable.

II\. Why called the Tabernacles of the Lord of hosts? To denote

1\. Its connection with the boundless universe;

2\. Its distinction from it. Present everywhere where God is peculiarly
present here.

III\. Why called amiable?

1\. Because of the character in which God dwells here. Is condescension
amiable? Is love? Is mercy? Is grace? These are displayed here.

2\. Because of the purpose for which he resides here. To save sinners;
to comfort saints.

[Psa 84:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#002.md). -

I. The Object of Desire.

1\. The house of the Lord;

2\. The Lord of the house; the life of God in us and our life in him.

II\. The Occasion of the Desire. Exclusion from the Sanctuary. David
says not, Oh how I long for my palace, my crown, my sceptre, my kingdom;
but, Oh how I long to return to the house of God!

III\. The Strength of the Desire.

1\. It was an inward longing, "my soul longeth," etc.;

2\. A painful longing, "yea, fainteth;"

3\. A prayerful longing, "my heart crieth out;"

4\. An entire longing, "my heart and my flesh," etc.;

Or,

I. The value of God's house is known by attending it.

II\. It is better known by being afterwards banished from it.

III\. It is best known by being restored to it.

[Psa 84:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001.md), [Psa
84:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#002.md), [Psa
84:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#003.md). - The Titles for God in these
three verses are worth dwelling upon. "Jehovah of Hosts;" "the living
God;" "my King and my God."

[Psa 84:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#003.md). -

I. The Eloquence of Grief. David in his banishment envies the sparrows
and the swallows that had built their nests by the house of God, more
than Absalom who had usurped his palace and his throne.

II\. The Ingenuity of Prayer. Why should sparrows and swallows be nearer
to thy altars than I am, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God! "Fear not,
ye are of more value than many sparrows."

[Psa 84:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#004.md). -

I. The Privilege suggested - dwelling in the house of God. Some birds
fly over the house of God - some occasionally alight upon it - others
build their nests and train up their young there. This was the privilege
which the Psalmist desired.

II\. The Fact asserted. "Blessed are they that dwell," etc., who make it
the spiritual home of themselves and their children.

III\. The Reason given. "They will be still," etc.

1\. They will have much for which to praise God;

2\. They will see much to praise in God.

[Psa 84:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#005.md). - Man is blessed,

I. When his strength is in God. Strength to believe, strength to obey,
strength to suffer.

II\. When God's ways are in him. "In whose heart," etc. When the
doctrines, precepts, and promises of God are deeply engraved upon the
heart.

[Psa 84:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#007.md). -

I. Trusting God in trouble brings present comfort - "Who passing," etc.

II\. Present comfort ensures still larger supplies - "The rain also,"
etc.

[Psa 84:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#008.md). - There is,

I. Progression. "They go:"

1\. The people of God cannot remain stationary;

2\. They must not recede;

3\. They should always be advancing.

II\. Invigoration. "From strength to strength."

1\. From one ordinance to another;

2\. from one duty to another;

3\. from one grace to another;

4\. from one degree of grace to another. Add faith to faith, virtue to
virtue, knowledge to knowledge," etc.

III\. Completion. "Every one of them," etc.

[Psa 84:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#008.md). -

I. Prayer is not confined to the Sanctuary. David, in his banishment,
says, "Hear my prayer."

II\. Help is not confined to the sanctuary. The Lord of hosts is "here,"
as well as in his tabernacles. See [Psa
84:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001.md).

III\. Grace is not confined to the Sanctuary. Here, too, in the
wilderness is the covenanting God, the God of Jacob.

[Psa 84:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#009.md). - Observe,

I. The Faith. Our shield is thine Anointed-Thine Anointed is our Shield.
This is not David, because he says our Shield, but David's greater Son.
A gleam of Gospel light through the thick clouds.

II\. The Prayer. "Behold, O God," etc. "Look," etc. Look upon him as our
Representative, and look upon us in him.

III\. The Plea.

1\. He has engaged to be our defence from thine anger;

2\. He has been anointed to this office by thee.

[Psa 84:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#010.md). - Here is,

I. A comparison of places. "A day in thy courts," etc. How much more a
day in heaven! What, then, must an eternity in heaven be!

II\. A comparison of Persons. "I would rather be a doorkeeper," etc.
Better be the least in the Church than the greatest in the world. If
"better reign in hell than serve in heaven" was Satan's first thought
after he fell, it was the first thought only.

[Psa 84:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#011.md). -

I. What God is to his people. "A sun and shield."

1\. The source of all good;

2\. A defence from all evil.

II\. What he gives.

1\. Grace here;

2\. glory hereafter.

III\. What he withholds. All that is not good. If he withholds health or
wealth, or his own smiles from us, it is because they are not good for
us at that particular time.

[Psa 84:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#012.md). -

I. The one thing that makes man blessed. Trust in God. "Blessed," etc.

1\. For all things;

2\. at all times;

3\. in all circumstances.

II\. The Blessing contained in that one thing, God himself becomes ours;

1\. his mercy for our pardon;

2\. his power for our protection;

3\. his wisdom for our guidance;

4\. his faithfulness for our preservation;

5\. his all-sufficiency for our supply.

III\. The certainty of the blessing.

1\. From David's own experience;

2\. from his solemn appeal to God respecting it. "O Lord God of hosts,"
etc.

\[All the above are by Rev. George Rogers.\]

[Psa 84:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#005.md). - The preciousness of
intensity and enthusiasm in religious belief, worship, and life.

[Psa 84:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#005.md), [Psa
84:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#006.md), [Psa
84:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#007.md). - The blessed people are
described,

I. By their earnest desire and resolution to take this journey, though
they dwelt far off from the tabernacle, ver. 5.

II\. By their painful passage, yet some refreshments by the way, ver. 6.

III\. By their constant progress, till they came to the place they aimed
at, ver. 7. - T. Manton.

[Psa 84:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#006.md). - As the valley of weeping
symbolizes dejection, so a "well" symbolizes ever-flowing salvation and
comfort (compare [Joh 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#014.md); also [Isa
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#003).md).

[Psa 84:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#006.md). -

I. "The valley of Baca." Of this valley we may observe,

1\. It is much frequented.

2\. Unpleasant to flesh and blood,

3\. Very healthful.

4\. Very safe.

5\. Very profitable.

II\. The toilsome effort: "make it a well."

1\. Comfort may be obtained in the deepest trouble.

2\. Comfort must be obtained by exertion.

3\. Comfort obtained by one is of use to others, as a well may be.

III\. The heavenly supply. "The rain also filleth the pools." All is
from God; effort is of no avail without him.

[Psa 84:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#008.md). - Pleas for answers to
prayer in the titles here used.

I. He is Jehovah, the living, all-wise, all-powerful, faithful,
gracious, and immutable God.

II\. He is God of hosts, having abundant agencies under his control; he
can send angels, restrain devils, actuate good men, overrule bad men,
and govern all other agents.

III\. He is the God of Jacob, of chosen Jacob, as seen in Jacob's dream;
God of Jacob in his banishment, in his wrestling (and so a God overcome
by prayer), God pardoning Jacob's sins, God preserving Jacob and his
seed after him.

[Psa 84:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#009.md). -

I. What god is to us.

II\. What we would have him look at.

III\. Where we would be: hidden behind the shield - seen in the person
of Christ.

[Psa 84:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#010.md). -

I. Days in God's courts. Days of hearing, of repenting, of believing, of
adoration, of communion, of revival, etc.

II\. Their preciousness. Better than a thousand days of victory, of
pleasure, of money-making, of harvest, of discussion, of travelling amid
beauties of nature.

III\. Reasons for this preciousness. They are more pleasurable, more
profitable now, and more preparatory for the future and for heaven. The
employment, the society, the enjoyment, the result, etc., are all
better.

[Psa 84:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#012.md). - The blessedness of the
life of faith over that of carnal enjoyment, religious feeling,
self-confidence, living upon marks and evidences, trusting in man, etc.

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Title

Here note: that the sons, that is, the posterity of wicked and
rebellious Korah, have an honourable place in God's sacred and solemn
service: for to them sundry of David's psalms are commended ... Here see
the verifying of God's word, for the comfort of all godly children, that
the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, [Eze
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#014.md), [Eze
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#017.md), [Eze
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#020.md), if he sees his father's sins
and turn from them. - Thomas Pierson (1570-1633) in "David's Heart's
Desire."

Whole Psalm

O Lord of hosts, how lovely in mine eyes

The tents where thou dost dwell!

For thine abode my spirit faints and sighs;

The courts I love so well.

My longing soul is weary

Within thy house to be;

This world is waste and dreary,

A desert land to me.

The sparrow, Lord, hath found a shelter'd home,

The swallow hath her nest;

She layeth there her young, and though she roam,

Returneth there to rest.

I, to thine altar flying,

Would there for ever be;

My heart and flesh are crying,

O living God, for thee!

How blest are they who in thy house abide!

Thee evermore they praise.

How strong the man whom thou alone dost guide,

Whose heart doth keep thy ways.

A pilgrim and a stranger,

He leaneth on thine arm;

And thou, in time of danger,

Dost shield him from alarm.

From strength to strength through Baca's vale of woe,

They pass along in prayer,

And gushing streams of living water flow,

Dug by their faithful care;

Thy rain is sent from heaven

To fertilise the land,

And wayside grace is given

Till they in Zion stand.

Lord God of hosts, attend unto my prayer!"

O Jacob's God, give ear!

Behold, O God, our Shield, we through thy care

Within thy courts appear!

Look thou upon the glory

Of thine Anointed's face;

In him we stand before thee,

To witness of thy grace!

One day with thee excelleth o'er and o'er

A thousand days apart;

In thine abode, within thy temple-door,

Would stand my watchful heart.

Men tell me of the treasure

Hid in their tents of sin;

I look not there for pleasure,

Nor choose to enter in.

Own thou the Lord to be thy Sun, thy Shield -

No good will he withhold;

He giveth grace, and soon shall be reveal'd

His glory, yet untold.

His mighty name confessing,

Walk thou at peace and free;

O Lord, how rich the blessing

Of him who trusts in thee!

\- German Choral Music.

[Psa 84:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001.md)

"How amiable are thy tabernacles." What was there in them that appeared
so amiable? Perchance, the edifice was famed for the skill and cost
bestowed on it? But the temple of extraordinary beauty was not yet
constructed. The tabernacle was lowly, more suited to pilgrims than to a
great people, and little becoming the king himself. Therefore to the
pious there is no need of vast or sumptuous temples to the end that they
should love the house of God. - Musculus.

[Psa 84:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001.md)

"How amiable are thy tabernacles." What made the tabernacle of Moses
lovely was not the outside, which was very mean, as the Church of God
outwardly is, through persecution, affliction, and poverty; but what was
within, having many golden vessels in it, and those typical of things
much more precious: moreover, here the priests were to be seen in their
robes, doing their duty and service, and, at certain times, the high
priest in his rich apparel; here were seen the sacrifices slain and
offered, by which the people were taught the nature of sin, the
strictness of justice, and the necessity and efficacy of the sacrifice
of Christ: here the Levites were heard singing their songs, and blowing
their trumpets: but much more amiable are the Church of God and its
ordinances in gospel times, where Christ, the great High-Priest, is seen
in the glories of his person, and the fulness of his grace; where Zion's
priests, or the ministers of the gospel, stand clothed, being full
fraught with salvation, and the tidings of it; where Christ is evidently
set forth, as crucified and slain, in the ministry of the word, and the
administration of ordinances; here the gospel trumpet is blown, and its
joyful sound echoed forth, and songs of love and grace are sung by all
believers; besides, what makes these tabernacles still more lovely are,
the presence of God here, so that they are no other than the house of
God, the gate of heaven; the provisions that are here made, and the
company that is here enjoyed. - John Gill.

[Psa 84:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001.md)

"Amiable." The adjective is rendered by the English versions "amiable,"
in the sense of the French amiable, lovely. But the usage of the Hebrew
word requires it to be understood as meaning dear, beloved, which is
exactly the idea here required by the context. The plural, dwellings,
has reference to the subdivisions and appurtenances of the sanctuary,
and is applied to the tabernacle in [Psa
48:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#003.md). Compare [Psa
68:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#035.md). The divine titles are as usual
significant. While one suggests the covenant relation between God and
the petitioner, the other makes his sovereignty the ground of a prayer
for his protection. - Joseph Addison Alexander.

[Psa 84:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001.md)

"Tabernacles." By the name of "tabernacles" we are put in mind of the
church's peregrination and wandering from one place unto another, until
she come unto her true country. For as tabernacle and tents of war be
removed hither and thither, so the Church of God in this life hath no
sure and quiet abode, but often is compelled to change her seat. This
pilgrimage, whereby indeed every man, as Augustine doth say, is a
pilgrim in this world, doth admonish us of sin, which is the cause of
this peregrination. For, because of sin we are cast with our first
parents out of Paradise into the land wherein we sojourn. So that we are
removed from Jerusalem, that is, from the sight and fruition of peace,
into Babylon, that is, into confusion and exile, wherein we wander far
and wide. - Nicholas Heminge \[Hemmingius\] (1513-1600\], in "The Faith
of the Church Militant."

[Psa 84:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001.md), [Psa
84:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#002.md)

When we cannot express the greatness of a thing in direct terms, we are
fain to fly to wonder and so doth David here, because he cannot express
sufficiently how amiable the Tabernacles of the Lord are, he therefore
falls to wondering, and helps himself with a question; How amiable are
thy Tabernacles, O Lord of Hosts? But is not David's wondering itself
wonderful, that the tabernacles of the Lord of Hosts should be so
wonderfully amiable? Is it not a wonder they should be amiable at all?
For are not his tabernacles, tents of war? and is there anything in war
that can be amiable? If he had said: How terrible are thy Tabernacles, O
Lord of Hosts; his wonder had been with some congruity; for the Lord of
Hosts is terrible in all his works; but to say, How amiable are thy
Tabernacles, O Lord of Hosts, seems to imply a contradiction; for though
they may be amiable, as they are tabernacles, yet they must needs be
terrible, as they are Tabernacles of the Lord of Hosts; and when this
terribleness hath made an abatement in their amiableness; what place
will be left for wonder, to give cause to say, How amiable are thy
Tabernacles, O Lord of Hosts? But if he had said, How terrible are thy
Tabernacles, O Lord of Hosts; though it might have been wonderful in the
degree, yet it could not be wonderful in the kind: for what wonder is
it, if the Tabernacles of the Lord of Hosts be terrible? But when he
saith, How amiable are thy Tabernacles, O Lord of Hosts; this is not
only wonderful in the degree, but in the kind much more. For what can be
more wonderful, than that being Tabernacles of the Lord of Hosts, they
should be amiable, and so amiable as to be wondered at? But is it not,
that God is in himself so amiable, that all things of His, even his
terrors themselves, are amiable'; his tabernacles and his tents, his
sword and his spear, his darts and his arrows, all amiable; terrible no
doubt to his enemies, but amiable, wonderfully amiable to all that love
and fear him, and great reason they should be so seeing they are all in
their defence, and for their safeguard; though they be Tabernacles of
the Lord of Hosts to the wicked, yet they are Courts of the Prince of
Peace to the godly, and this makes my soul to long for the courts of the
Lord. For I desire indeed to be a courtier, yet not as I am now: God
knows I am very unfit for it, but because God's Courts are such, they
make any one fit, that but comes into them; they receive not men fit,
but make them fit; and he that was before but a shrub in Baca, as soon
as he comes into the Courts of the Lord is presently made a cedar in
Lebanon. - Sir Richard Baker.

[Psa 84:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#002.md)

"My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth," etc. Every amiableness is not so
great to make a longing, nor every longing so great to make a fainting;
nor every fainting so great, to make the soul to faint; Oh, then,
consider how great this amiableness is, which makes my soul not only to
long, but to faint with longing! And blame me not for fainting, as
though it were my own fault for not restraining my longing; for seeing
his Tabernacles are of infinite amiableness, they must needs work in me
an infinite delighting, and that delighting an infinite longing; and
what restraint can there be of that which is infinite? No, alas, my
fainting is but answerable to my longing, and my longing but answerable
to the amiableness. If I had the offer made me, which was made to
Christ, to enjoy all the kingdoms of the earth, but with condition to
want the Courts of the Lord; this want would bring to my soul a greater
grief than that enjoying would give it contentment: for seeing his
Tabernacles are so amiable, where He is Lord of Hosts, how amiable must
they needs be, where he is Prince of Peace? and Prince of Peace he is in
his Courts, though in his camp he be Lord of Hosts. - Sir Richard Baker.

[Psa 84:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#002.md)

"My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth." The word כּלה (fainteth)
signifies to be consumed with longing, as the Latins say, deperire
aliquern amore (he is dying of love); that is, he so vehemently loves,
and is enflamed with so great a desire to obtain the loved object, that
he wastes and pines away unless his wish is gratified. Therefore, an
ardent longing is meant, which so torments and burns the mind, that
flesh and marrow waste away, so long as it is not permitted to enjoy the
things desired. - Mollerus.

[Psa 84:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#002.md)

"Soul ... heart ... flesh." Marking the whole man, with every faculty
and affection. The verbs are also very expressive. The first, "longeth,"
means literally, "hath grown pale," as with the intensity of the
feeling; the second, "fainteth," is more exactly "faileth," or "is
consumed." [Job 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#027.md). - J. J. Stewart
Perowne.

[Psa 84:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#002.md)

"Crieth." The word that is here rendered "crieth," is from רנן, that
signifies to shout, shrill, or cry out, as soldiers do at the beginning
of a battle, when they cry out, Fall on, fall on, fall on, or when they
cry out after a victory, Victory, victory, victory! The Hebrew word
notes a strong cry, or to cry as a child cries when it is sadly hungry,
for now every whit of the child cries, hands cry, and face cries, and
feet cry. - Thomas Brooks.

[Psa 84:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#002.md)

"Living God." [Psa 42:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#002.md), "My soul
thirsteth for God, for the living God," is the only other place in the
Psalms where God is so named. This particular form of expression, El
Chaff, occurs but twice beside in the Bible, [Jos
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#010.md); [Hos
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#010.md). - J. J. Stewart Perowne.

[Psa 84:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#003.md)

"The sparrow hath found an house," etc. The tender care of God, over the
least of his creatures, is here most touchingly alluded to. The
Psalmist, while in exile, envies them their privileges. He longs to be
nestling, as it were, in the dwelling-place of God. The believer finds a
perfect home and rest in God's altars; or, rather, in the great truths
which they represent. Still, his confidence in God is sweetened and
strengthened by the knowledge of his minute, universal, providential
care. It becomes his admiring delight. "God fails not," as one has
beautifully said, "to find a house for the most worthless, and a nest
for the most restless of birds." What confidence this should give us!
How we should rest! What repose the soul finds that casts itself on the
watchful, tender care of him who provides so fully for the need of all
his creatures! We know what the expression of "nest" conveys, just as
well as that of "a house." Is it not a place of security, a shelter from
storm, a covert to hide oneself in, from every evil, a protection from
all that can harm, "a place to rest in, to nestle in, to joy in"? But
there is one thing in these highly privileged birds which strikes us
forcibly in our meditations - they knew not him from whom all this
kindness flowed - they knew neither his heart nor his hand. They enjoyed
the rich provisions of his tender care; he thought of everything for
their need, but there was no fellowship between them and the Great
Giver. From this, O my soul, thou mayest learn a useful lesson. Never
rest satisfied with merely frequenting such places, or with having
certain privileges there; but rise, in spirit, and seek and find and
enjoy direct communion with the living God, through Jesus Christ our
Lord. The heart of David turns to God himself. "My heart and my flesh
crieth out for the living God." - Things New and Old.

[Psa 84:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#003.md)

"The swallow a nest," etc. The confidence which these birds place in the
human race is not a little extraordinary. They not only put themselves,
but their offspring in the power of men. I have seen their nests in
situations where they were within the reach of one's hand, and where
they might have been destroyed in an instant. I have observed them under
a doorway, the eaves of a low cottage, against the wall of a tool-shed,
on the knocker of a door, and the rafter of a much-frequented hay-loft.
- Edward Jesse, in "Gleanings in Natural History." 1856.

[Psa 84:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#003.md)

"Even thine altars." There were two altars; the "brazen altar," and the
"golden altar;" to those, no doubt, the Psalmist refers. Both were of
shittim wood, which sets forth the holy humanity - the perfect manhood,
of the Lord Jesus. Incarnation lies at the foundation of all his work
for us, and of all our blessing in him. The one altar was overlaid with
brass, the other with pure gold. The overlaying shadows forth his
Godhead, but in distinct aspects. We have the same Jesus in both, but
shadowed forth in different circumstances. In the one, humiliation and
suffering; in the other, exaltation and glory. - Things New and Old.

[Psa 84:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#003.md)

"Thine altars." There is in the original a pathetical, a vehement, a
broken expressing, expressed, O thine altars. It is true, (says David)
thou art here in the wilderness, and I may see thee here, and serve thee
here, but O thine altars, O Lord of Hosts, my King and my God. - John
Donne.

[Psa 84:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#003.md)

"Thine altars" is a poetical way of saying "Thy house." it is manifestly
a special term, instead of a general. Yet it has been seriously argued,
that no birds could or would ever be suffered to build their nests on
the altar. Surely this sort of expression, which is hardly a figure, is
common enough. A parte potiori fit de-nominatio. We say, "There goes a
sail." What should we think of a man who should argue that a sail cannot
go? The altars mean the temple. There was

"no jutty frieze,

Buttress, nor coigne of vantage, but these birds

Had made their pendant bed;"

not to mention that trees grew within the sacred enclosure, where birds
might have built their nests. - J. J. Stewart Perowne.

[Psa 84:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#003.md)

A custom existing among several nations of antiquity, is deemed capable
of illustrating the present passage. For birds whose nests chanced to be
built on the temples, or within the limits of them, were not allowed to
be driven away, much less to be killed, but found there a secure and
undisturbed abode. - William Keatinge Clay.

[Psa 84:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#004.md)

"Blessed are they that dwell in thy house," etc. Alas, how happens this?
There were tabernacles before, as belonging to a Lord; and courts as
belonging to a king, and altars as belonging to a God; and now to be but
a house as belonging to a private man; and so all this great rising to
end in a fall? No, my soul, it is no fall, it is an aggregation rather
of all the other; for where his tabernacles did but serve to shew his
power, his courts but to shew his majesty; his altars but to shew his
deity, his house serves to shew them all; for in his house there will
still be praising him, and his praise and glory is the sum of all. Or is
it that to dwell in God's house is a kind of appropriating him to
ourselves, seeing his tabernacles and his courts lie open to strangers,
his house open to none but his servants; and seeing in the nearness of
God, and conversing with him, consists all true blessedness; therefore
"Blessed are they that dwell in his house," but how dwell in it? Not to
look in sometimes as we pass by, or to stay in it a time, as we do at an
inn, but to be constant abiders in it day and night, as to which we have
devoted ourselves and vowed our service. - Sir Richard Baker.

[Psa 84:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#004.md)

"Blessed are they that dwell in thy house." What was this house more to
David than another house, save that here he reckoned upon enjoying the
Divine Presence? So that here was a heart so naturalized to this
presence as to affect an abode in it, and that he might lead his life
with God, and dwell with him all his days; he could not be content with
giving a visit now and then. And why should this temper of spirit in the
clearer light of the gospel be looked upon as an unattainable thing? A
lazy despondency, and the mean conceit that it is modest not to aim so
high, starves religion, and stifles all truly noble and generous
desires. Let this then be the thing designed with you, and constantly
pursue and drive the design, that you may get into this disposition of
spirit toward God. - John Howe.

[Psa 84:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#004.md)

"Blessed are they that dwell in thy house," etc. Blessed indeed, we too
may exclaim, and blessed shall they be for ever. They are dwellers, not
visitors, in God's house. "I will dwell in the house of the Lord for
ever." This is true, blessedly true, of all who trust in Jesus now. But
though God's children are all priests by birth, as were the sons of
Aaron, they are not all, alas! priests by consecration. (See Exod. 29)
Comparatively few know their priestly place at the golden altar. Many of
them are doubting as to whether their sins, root and branch, were all
consumed outside the camp; and, consequently, such are afraid to come
within the court, and as for being assured of their full justification
and sanctification in the risen One, they gravely doubt and fear that
such blessedness can ever be their happy lot. Hence that state of soul
which answers to priestly consecration at the laver, and happy worship
at the golden altar, is unknown and unenjoyed. They are not priests by
consecration.

Our text is plain. "They will still be praising thee." Doubts, fears,
unsettled questions, all are gone, Such cannot exist in the holy place.
All, of course, who are in Christ, must be in God's account where he is;
but all who believe in Christ, do not know and believe that they are in
him, as being one with him now. When the state of our souls answers to
what is symbolized by the holy place, we can only praise: "They that
dwell in thy house will be still praising thee." Then we are happily
near to God, and have communion with him, in the glorified Christ,
through the power of the Holy Ghost. - Things New and Old.

[Psa 84:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#004.md)

"They will be still praising thee." How appears it to be true, that they
who dwell in God's house will always be praising him, seeing it is but
seldom seen that servants be so forward to praise their masters? O my
soul I it is not so much the good dispositions of the servants, as the
infinite worthiness of the Master that makes them to praise him, for
when they see the admirable economy of his government, when they see how
sweetly he disposeth all things in weight and measure, when they find
him to use them more like children than servants, what heart can be so
ungrateful as not to praise him? And seeing by dwelling in God's house,
they see these things continually, therefore they that dwell in his
house will always be praising him. - Sir Richard Baker.

[Psa 84:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#004.md)

"They will be still praising thee." As having hearts full of heaven, and
consciences full of comfort. There cannot but be music in the temple of
the Holy Ghost. - John Trapp.

[Psa 84:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#004.md)

"Still praising." It is not enough to praise him, it must be a praising
him still, before it will make a blessedness; and though to praise God
be an easy matter, yet to praise him still, will be found a busy work,
indeed to flesh and blood a miserable work, for if I be still praising
him, what time shall I have for any pleasure? O my soul, if thou make it
not thy pleasure, thy chief, thy only pleasure to be praising him, thou
art not like in haste to come to blessedness. And marvel not that David
speaks thus under the law, when St. Paul under the Gospel saith as much:
"Whether ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, let all be done to the
glory and praise of God!" - Sir Richard Baker.

[Psa 84:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#005.md)

"In whose heart are thy ways." That is, who love the ways that lead to
thy house. - Ernest Hawkins.

[Psa 84:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#005.md)

"In whose heart are the ways of them." Literally, "The steeps are on
their hearts." The steep ascents on which the tabernacle stood. Horsley
renders, "They are bent on climbing the steep ascents." Perhaps the
טמלּות were more properly the raised causeways or stairs leading up to
Mount Zion, or all through the mountain country on the road to
Jerusalem. - John Fry.

[Psa 84:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#005.md)

"In whose heart are the ways." The natural heart is a pathless
wilderness, full of cliffs and precipices. When the heart is renewed by
grace, a road is made, a highway is prepared for our God. See [Isa
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003.md), [Isa
40:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#004.md). - Frederick Fysh.

[Psa 84:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#006.md)

"Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well," etc. I consider
the valley here mentioned to be the same as the valley of Bochim,
mentioned in [Jdg 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#001.md), [Jdg
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#005.md), which received its name from the
weeping of the Jews, when they were rebuked by an angel for their
disobedience to the commands of God. This valley is called חבּכאים,
Habb'caim, in [Sa2 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#024.md), the ה of
בּכה, to weep being changed into א. Josephus mentions, that the
circumstance there related occurred ἐν τοῖς ἂλσεσι τοῖς ακλουμένοις
Κλαυθμῶσι. Antiquit. Jud. lib. vii. c. 4. חבּכאים, Habb'caim, is
rendered in that verse by the lxx. Κλαυθμῶν weepings; and in [Jdg
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#001.md) חבּך יס, Habbocim, is also
rendered by the lxx. Κλαυθμῶν, weepings. The valley mentioned in [Psa
84:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#006.md) is called by the lxx. Κλαυθμῶν. I
am inclined therefore to think, that in this place, joining to חבּכא the
מ of the following word, and supplying before it, we ought to read
חבּכאים צין instead of הבּכא מעין... All the ancient versionists seem to
have thought, that the valley in this verse received its name from בּכה,
bacah, to weep. I translate the verse, "Passing through the valley of
Bochim, they will make it a fountain even of blessings; it shall be
covered with the former rain." The Psalm has been supposed to have been
written by Jehoshaphat. Probably he passed through Bochim, which seems
to have been an arid valley, when he marched against the Moabites and
Ammonites: see 2 Chron. 20. After the victory, the army of Jehoshaphat
assembled in a valley, where they blessed the Lord; and from this
circumstance it received the name of Berachah: see ver. 26. Perhaps the
word בּרכות in this verse has an allusion to that circumstance; and
perhaps the valley of Berachah was, before that glorious occasion,
called the valley of Bochim. - Richard Dixon.

[Psa 84:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#006.md)

Passing through the valley of weeping make him, that is, Jehovah, a
fountain. That is, they trust, and from him look for help, who having
plain paths in their mind must pass through many difficulties; Similar
help is sought by those, who, suffering from a scanty supply of water,
press on through a dry valley, and yet do not despair or grow weary, but
have God for their fountain, from which they drink and are refreshed. -
Venema.

[Psa 84:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#006.md)

"The valley of Baca." Valley of tear-shrubs. - E. W. Hengstenberg.

[Psa 84:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#006.md)

"Baca," signifieth a mulberry-tree, which loves to grow in dry places
that be sandy and barren, [Sa2 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#023.md),
[Sa2 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#024.md), or [Ch1
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#014.md), [Ch1
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#015.md). Now they whose hearts be set
upon God's house and holy worship, when they go thitherward through a
sandy, dry, barren valley, do make it a well, - that is, repute and
count it as a well; the word ישׁיתוּהוּ signifieth to put or set, as
[Gen 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015.md); [Psa
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#006.md), [Psa
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#012.md), and [Psa
83:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#011.md), [Psa
83:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#013.md). For thus will they say with
themselves, thinking upon the comfort of God's favour to whom they go,
that it shall be to them as the rain of blessings, a plentiful and
liberal rain upon the ground. - Thomas Pierson.

[Psa 84:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#006.md)

"Make it a well." That which seemed an impediment turns to a
furtherance; at least, no misery can be so great, no estate so barren,
but a godly heart can make it a well, out of which to draw forth water
of comfort; either water to cleanse, and make it a way to repentance; or
water to cool, and make it a way to patience; or water to moisten, and
make it a way of growing in grace; and if the well happen to be dry, and
afford no water from below, yet the rain shall fill their pools, and
supply them with water from above. If natural forces be not sufficient,
there shall be supernatural graces added to assist them, that though
troubles of the world seem rubs in the way to blessedness, yet in truth
they are none, they hinder not arriving at the mark we aim at, they
hinder us not from being made members of Sion, they hinder us not from
approaching the presence of God. No, my soul, they are rather helps, for
by this means we go from strength to strength, from strength of
patience, to strength of hope; from strength of hope, to strength of
faith, to strength of vision; and then will be accomplished that which
David speaks here; "Blessed is the man whose strength is in God, and in
whose heart his ways are." - Sir Richard Baker.

[Psa 84:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#006.md)

"The rain." Little as there may be of water, that little suffices on
their way. It is "a well" to them. They find only "pools (which) the
early rain has (barely) covered" - but are content with the supply by
the way. It is as good and sufficient to them as if showers of the heavy
autumnal rains had filled the well. Pilgrims forget the scanty supply at
an inn, when they have abundance in view at the end. Israelites going up
to the Passover made light of deficient water, for their hearts were set
on reaching Jerusalem. - Andrew A. Bonar.

[Psa 84:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#006.md), [Psa
84:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#007.md)

The most gloomy present becomes bright to them: passing through even a
terrible wilderness, they turn it into a place of springs, their joyous
hope and the infinite beauty of the goal, which is worth any amount of
toil and trouble, afford them enlivening comfort, refreshing,
strengthening in the midst of the arid steppe.

Not only does their faith bring forth water out of the sand and rocks of
the desert, but God also on his part lovingly anticipates their love,
and rewardingly anticipates their faithfulness: a gentle rain, like that
which refreshes the sown fields in the autumn, descends from above and
enwraps the valley of Baca in a fulness of blessing: the arid steppe
becomes resplendent with a flowery festive garment ([Isa
35:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001).md), not to outward appearance,
but to them spiritually in a manner none the less true and real. And
whereas under ordinary circumstances, the strength of the traveller
diminishes in proportion as he has traversed more and more of his
toilsome road, with them it is the very reverse; "they go from strength
to strength." - Franz Delitzsch.

[Psa 84:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#007.md)

"They go from strength to strength." Junius reads it,and so it is in the
Hebrew, "They go from company to company." As they went up to Jerusalem
they went in troops and companies. Possibly we translate it strength,
because much of our safety consisteth in good society. - George
Swinnock.

[Psa 84:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#007.md)

"Every one of them in Zion appeareth before God." That is, every one of
them answering to the character described. Others as well as they would
appear in Zion before God; but not to enjoy his presence, and receive
tokens of his favour. Blessedness was now to be enjoyed, but it could
only be enjoyed by those who had been previously fitted for it by
character and attainment. As certainly as these had been acquired, so
certainly would the blessedness be enjoyed by each and by all of them.
"Every one of them in Zion appeareth be fore God." No one has perished
by the way - none been devoured by wild beasts - none cut off by the
wandering banditti - none become faint-hearted and turned back. The
whole bands are assembled - young and old, weak and strong; all answer
to their names, and testify to the goodness of the Lord in bearing them
up, and bringing through - in affording them rest, and yielding them
pleasure. So shall it ever be with true spiritual pilgrims. The grace of
God will always prove sufficient to preserve them, safe and blameless,
to his heavenly kingdom and glory - troubles shall not overwhelm them -
temptations not wholly overcome them - spiritual enemies shall not
destroy them. They are kept by the power of God, through faith unto
salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time. Their names are
written in the Lamb's book of life, and the Lamb himself shall see to it
that each of them is found in the day of account. Then shall he be able
to say, "Those whom thou hast given me I have kept, and none of them is
lost." "They are all here before God." - William Makelvie. 1863.

[Psa 84:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#008.md)

There are two distinct thoughts of great practical value to the
Christian, in this short prayer. There is the sense of divine majesty,
and the consciousness of divine relationship. As "Lord of hosts," he is
almighty in power; as the "God of Jacob," he is infinite in mercy and
goodness to his people. - Things New and Old.

[Psa 84:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#009.md)

While many, alas, are satisfied with mere formalities in religion, or
with the dry discussion of doctrines, high or low, as they may be
called, see thou and be occupied with Christ himself. It is the
knowledge of his person that gives strength and joy to the soul. At all
times, under all circumstances, we can say, "Look upon the face of thine
Anointed." We cannot always say, Look on us; but we may always say, Look
on Him. In deepest sorrow through conscious failure, or in trials and
difficulties through faithfulness to his name, we can ever plead with
God what Christ is. God is ever well pleased with him - ever occupied
with him as risen from the dead and exalted to his own right hand in
heaven; and he would have us also to be occupied with him as the heart's
exclusive object. True faith can only rest on God's estimate of Christ,
not on inward thoughts and feelings. That which may be called the faith
of the formalist, rests on the ability of his own mind to judge of these
matters. He trusts in himself. This is the essential difference between
faith in appearance and faith in reality. - Things New and Old.

[Psa 84:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#009.md)

"Look upon the face of thine anointed." For I shall never come to look
upon thy face, if thou vouchsafe not first to look upon mine: if thou
afford me not as well the benefit of thine eyes, to look upon me, as the
favour of thine ears to hear me, I shall be left only to a bare
expectation, but never come to the happiness of fruition; but when thou
vouch safest to look upon my face, that look of thine hath an influence
of all true blessedness, and makes me find what a happiness it is to
have the God of Jacob for my shield. - Sir Richard Baker.

[Psa 84:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#010.md)

"A day." The least good look that a man hath from God, and the least
good word that a man hears from God, and the least love letter and love
token that a man receives from God, is exceedingly precious to that man
that hath God for his portion. "One day in thy courts is better than a
thousand elsewhere." ye doth not say, One year in thy courts is better
than a thousand elsewhere, but One day in thy courts is better than a
thousand elsewhere; nor doth he say, One quarter of a year in thy courts
is better than a thousand elsewhere, but "One day in thy courts is
better than a thousand elsewhere"; nor doth he say, One month is better
than a thousand elsewhere, but "One day in thy courts is better than a
thousand elsewhere," to shew that the very least of God is exceeding
precious to a gracious soul that hath God for his portion. - Thomas
Brooks.

[Psa 84:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#010.md)

Another sign of God's children is, to delight to be much in God's
presence. Children are to be in the presence of their father; where the
King is, there is the court; where the presence of God is, there is
heaven. God is in a special manner present in his ordinances, they are
the Ark of his presence. Now, if we are his children, we love to be much
in holy duties. In the use of ordinances we draw near to God, we come
into our Father's presence; in prayer we have secret conference with
God; the soul while it is praying, is as it were parlying with God. In
the word we hear God speaking from heaven to us; and how doth every
child of God delight to hear his Father's voice! In the sacrament God
kisseth his children with the kisses of his lips; he gives them a smile
of his face, and a privy-seal of his love: oh, it is good to draw near
to God. It is sweet being in his presence: every true child of God
saith, "A day in thy courts is better than a thousand!" - Thomas Watson.

[Psa 84:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#010.md)

"I had rather be a doorkeeper," etc. Some read it, "I would rather be
fixed to a post in the house of my God, than live at liberty in the
tents of the wicked;" alluding to the law concerning servants, who if
they would not go out free, were to have their ear bored to the
door-post, [Exo 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#005.md), [Exo
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#006.md). David loved his Master, and
loved his work so well, that he desired to be tied to this service for
ever, to be more free to it, but never to go out free from it,
preferring bonds to duty far before the greatest liberty to sin. Such a
superlative delight have holy hearts in holy duties; no satisfaction in
their account comparable to that in communion with God. - Matthew Henry.

[Psa 84:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#010.md)

"I had rather be a doorkeeper." In the sense that Christ is a Door,
David may well be content to be a Door-Keeper, and though in God's house
there be many mansions, yet seeing all of them are glorious, even the
door-keeper's place is not without its glory. But if you think the
office to be mean, consider then whose officer he is for even a
door-keeper is an officer in God's house and God never displaceth his
officers unless it be to advance them to a higher; whereas, in the
courts of princes, the greatest officers are oftentimes displaced,
turned off often with disgrace. - Sir Richard Baker.

[Psa 84:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#010.md)

"I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God," etc. Happy are
those persons, whom God will use as besoms to sweep out the dust from
his temple; or who shall tug at an oar in the boat where Christ and his
church are embarked. - William Secker, in "The Nonsuch Professor."

[Psa 84:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#010.md)

"Doorkeeper." This is a Korhite Psalm, and the descendants of Korah
were, in fact, porters, and "keepers of the gates of the tabernacle, and
keepers of the entry," as well as being permitted to swell the chorus of
the inspired singers of Israel. - Bossuet, quoted by Neale and
Littledale.

[Psa 84:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#010.md)

Instead of, "I had rather be a doorkeeper," the margin has, according to
the Hebrew, "I would choose rather to sit at the threshold." Ainsworth's
translation is: "I have chosen to sit at the threshold, in the house of
my God;" and Dr. Boothroyd's is: "Abide, or sit, at the threshold." See
[Kg2 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#009.md); [Kg2
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#004.md); [Kg2
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#018.md); [Ch1
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#019.md); [Ch2
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#004.md); [Est
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#021.md); [Est
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#002.md). In all these passages the
marginal reading is threshold. I think the word "door-keeper" does not
convey the proper meaning of the words, "to sit at the threshold";
because the preference of the Psalmist was evidently given to a very
humble position; whereas that of a door-keeper, in Eastern estimation,
is truly respectable and confidential.

The marginal reading, however, "to sit at the threshold," at once
strikes on an Eastern mind as a situation of deep humility.

See the poor heathen devotee: he goes and sits near the threshold of his
temple. Look at the beggar: he sits, or prostrates himself, at the
threshold of the door or gate, till he shall have gained his suit. -
Joseph Roberts.

[Psa 84:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#010.md)

"House." "Tents." Observe the force of the contrasted expressions. The
"house" is the Lord's; the "tents" are of the wicked. The pleasures of
sin are for a season only; the world passeth away, and the lusts
thereof. - Arthur Pridham.

[Psa 84:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#010.md)

"The tents." It is not any tents, or tents of any ordinary kind, that
are understood, but rich, powerful, glorious, and splendid tents. -
Venema.

[Psa 84:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#011.md)

"The Lord God is a sun," conveys a striking and impressive truth, when
we think of the sun only in his obvious character as a source of light
and heat. But what new energy is given to this magnificent emblem, when
we learn from astronomy that he is a grand centre of attraction, and
when we, in addition, take in that sublime generalization that the sun
is the ultimate source of every form of power existing in the world! The
wind wafts the commerce of every nation over the mighty deep; but the
heat of the sun has rarefied that air, and set that wind in motion. The
descending stream yields a power which grinds your grain, turns your
spindles, works your looms, drives your forges; but it is because the
sun gathered up the vapour from the ocean, which fell upon the hills,
and is finding its way back to the source whence it came. The expansive
energy of steam propels your engine; but the force with which it
operates is locked up in the coal (the remains of extinct forests stored
among your hills), or is derived from the wood that abounds in your
forests, which now crown and beautify their summits. Both these primeval
and these existing forests drew their subsistence from the sun: it is
the chemical force resident in his rays which disengaged their carbon
from the atmosphere, and laid it up as a source of power for future use.
The animal exerts a force by muscular contraction; he draws it from the
vegetable on which he feeds; the vegetable derives it from the sun,
whose rays determine its growth. Every time you lift your arm, every
time you take a step, you are drawing on the power the sun has given
you. When you step into the railway carriage, it is the sun-power that
hurries you along. When gentle breezes fan your languid cheek, and when
the resistless tornado levels cities in its fury, they are the servants
of the sun. What an emblem of Him in whom we live, and move, and have
our being! - Professor Green.

The "sun," which among all inanimate creatures is the most excellent,
notes all manner of excellency, provision, and prosperity; and the
"shield," which among all artificial creatures is the chiefest, notes
all manner of protection whatsoever. Under the name of "grace," all
spiritual good is wrapped up; and under the name of "glory," all eternal
good is wrapped up; and under the last clause, "No good thing will he
withhold," is wrapped up all temporal good: all put together speaks out
God to be an all-sufficient portion. - Thomas Brooks.

[Psa 84:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#011.md)

"The Lord God is a shield." He is a shield to our persons: "Touch not,"
said he, "mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm." "The Lord," said
Moses in his name, "the Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming
in. He shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy
ways, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone." "Hast thou
considered my servant Job?" said God to Satan: - "Yes," replied Satan,
"I have: thou hast set a hedge about him. Yes, brethren; "the Lord God
is a shield." He is a shield to our graces. The dislike and malice of
Satan is principally levelled at us when we become subjects of divine
influence "Simon, Simon," said our Saviour, "Satan hath desired to have
thee, that he may sift thee as wheat, but," he adds, "I have prayed for
thee, that thy faith fail not." There was a shield to the good man's
faith, or he and it too had been gone. You may remember the name of
Little Faith in Bunyan's Pilgrim. It appears that Hopeful was greatly
surprised that the robbers had not taken his jewels from him; but he was
given to understand that they were not in his own keeping. Yes,
Christian, He shall be thy "shield" to cover thy hope when it appears to
thee to be giving up the ghost ... Yes, and He will be a shield to thy
property. "Hast thou not set a hedge about all that he hath?" Though Job
was tried a little while, his property was only put out to interest; by
and by it came back cent per cent.; and he gained, besides, a vast
increase of knowledge and of grace. - Matthew Wilks. 1746-1829.

[Psa 84:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#011.md)

Turn your thoughts to the combination; "the Lord God is a sun and
shield." As a sun he shows me more and more of my sinfulness; but then
as a shield, he gives me power to oppose it and assurance that I shall
conquer. As a sun, he discloses so much of the enormity of guilt, that I
am forced to exclaim, "Mine iniquities are like a sore burden, too heavy
for me to bear;" but then as a shield, he shows me that he has laid the
load on a Surety, who bore it into a land of forgetfulness. As a sun, he
makes me daily more and more sensible of the utter impossibility of my
Working out a righteousness of my own; but then, as a shield, he fastens
constantly my thoughts on that righteousness of his Son, which is
meritoriously conveyed to all who believe on his name. As a sun, in
short, he brings facts to my knowledge, (inasmuch as he brings myself
and mine enemies to my knowledge,) which would make the matter of
deliverance seem out of reach and hopeless if he were not at the same
time a shield; but seeing that he is both, a shield as well as a sun,
the disclosures which he makes as a sun only prepare me for the blessing
which he imparts as a shield. Who then shall wonder, that after
announcing the character of God, the Psalmist should break into
expressions of confidence and assurance? It may be, that as the
corruption of nature is brought continually before me, deeper and wider
and darker, Satan will ply me with the suggestion; "The guiltiness is
too inveterate to be eradicated, and too enormous to be pardoned"; and
if God were a sun, and nothing more, it might be hard to put away the
suggestion as a device of the father of lies. I might then fear. I might
fear God's holiness, thinking I should never be fitted for communion
with Deity; I might fear God's justice, thinking I should never find
acquittal at the last dread assize. But can I fear either, when besides
a sun, God is also a shield? Can I fear God's justice, when as a shield
he places sufferings to my account, which satisfy the law, even to the
last penalty? Can I fear his holiness, when he gives me interest in an
obedience, which fulfils every precept? Does not the one character, that
of a shield, help me to scatter those solicitudes, which may well be
excited through the operation of the other character, that of a sun? And
am I not warranted - nay, am I not living far below my privilege - if I
fail in deriving from the combination of character a boldness and a
confidence, not to be overborne by those suspicions, which have Satan
for their author? As a sun, God shows me myself; as a shield, God shows
me himself. The sun discloses mine own nothingness; the shield, Divine
sufficiency. The one enables me to discern that I deserve nothing but
wrath, and can earn nothing but shame; the other, that I have a title to
immortality, and may lay claim to an enduring inheritance in heaven. I
learn, in short, from God as "a Sun," that if I have "wages," I must
have eternal death; but from God as "a Shield," that if I will receive
the "free gift" I may have "eternal life." Whom then shall I fear?
Myself - confessedly my worst enemy? "The Sun" makes a man start from
himself; the "Shield" assures him that he shall be protected against
himself and builded up "for a habitation of God through the Spirit."
Shall I shrink from Satan and the hosts of principalities and powers?
The "Sun" shows them awful in their might, and vehement in their malice;
but the "Shield" exhibits them spoiled and led captive, when Christ died
and rose again. Shall I dread death? Indeed the "Sun" makes death
terrible, forcing me to read God's curse in the motionless limbs and
mouldering features; but then the "Shield" displays the open sepulchre,
the quickened dust, the marvels of a resurrection, the mountain and the
ocean and the valley yeilding up the sleeping generations. Is death to
be dreaded? Take the catalogue of things, which, inasmuch as we are
fallen creatures, Gaod, as our "Sun," instructs us to fear; and we shall
find, that insomuch as we are redeemed creatures, God as our "Shield"
enables us to triumph over all our fears. Who therefore shall hesitate
to agree, that there results from this combination of character exactly
that system of counterpoise, which we affirm to be discoverable in grace
as well as in providence? Who can fail, if indeed we have been
disciplined by that twofold tuition, which informs man first that he has
destroyed himself and then that God hath "laid help on One that is
mighty," the former lesson humiliating, the latter encouraging, the one
making way for the other, so that the scholar is emptied of every false
confidence that he may be fitted to entertain the true - oh! who, we
say, can fail to gather from the combination of Divine character the
inference drawn by the Psalmist? to exclaim (that is), after recording
that "the Lord God is a Sun and Shield - He will give grace and glory:
no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly"? - Henry
Melvill.

[Psa 84:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#011.md)

The words of the text are as a voice from heaven, inviting me up
thither, and answering all the doubts and fears of such as believe and
follow the joyful sound. Am I in darkness, and fear I shall never find
the way? Open thine eye, O my soul! look up to the Father of lights: the
Lord is a sun, whose steady beams shall direct thy steps. Is there an
inward veil to be removed from my mind, as well as obscurity from my
path? He is sufficient for both. God who commanded the light to shine
out of darkness, can shine into the heart, to give the light of the
knowledge of his glory, and lead on to it. ([Co2
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#006)..md) He can make the day dawn, and
the day star to arise in our hearts; ([Pe2
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#019).md), and by both, guide our feet
into the way of peace. ([Luk 1:79](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#079)..md)
Doth the same light that discovers my way, discover what opposition I am
like to meet with? what enemies and dangers I am to go through? Hear, O
my soul, the Lord is a shield. Light and strength are conjoined; none
can miscarry under his conduct, nor have any reason to be discouraged.
With this he comforteth Abraham. [Gen
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#001.md), "Fear not: I am thy shield." Do
I groan under a sense of my unmeetness for the heavenly kingdom? Let
this support my soul, "the Lord will give grace." Am I altogether
unworthy of so high happiness? It springs from his own most free,
unbounded love; "the Lord will give glory." Am I urged with a thousand
wants that need supply, what more can be added? "No good thing will he
withhold from them that walk uprightly." Nothing that is evil can be
desired; and nothing that is good shall be denied. Here, O my soul, is a
fountain opened; here thy eager thirst may be fully satisfied; thy
largest desires filled up; and thy mind be ever at rest. - Daniel
Wilcox.

[Psa 84:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#011.md)

Why need a saint fear darkness, when he has such a sun to guide him? Or
dread dangers, when he has such a shield to guard him? - William Seeker.

[Psa 84:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#011.md)

"The Lord will give glory." "Man," says a wise author, "is the glory of
this lower world; the soul is the glory of man; grace is the glory of
the soul; and heaven is the glory of grace." Heaven, or glory, is grace
matured and brought to infinite perfection; there we shall see his face,
and have his name written in our foreheads; and we shall reign with him
for ever and ever. - Matthew Wilks.

[Psa 84:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#011.md)

"No good thing will he withhold," etc. But how is this true, when God
oftentimes withholds riches and honours, and health of body from men,
though they walk never so uprightly; we may therefore know that honours
and riches and bodily strength are none of God's good things; they are
of the number of things Indifferent which God bestows promiscuously upon
the just and unjust, as the rain to fall and the sun to shine. The good
things of God are chiefly peace of conscience and joy in the Holy Ghost
in this life; fruition of God's presence, and vision of his blessed face
in the next, and these good things God never bestows upon the wicked,
never withholds from the godly, and they are all cast up in one sum
where it is said, Beati mundo corde, quoniam ipsi Deum videbunt,
"Blessed are the pure of heart (and such are only they that walk
uprightly) for they shall see God." But is walking uprightly such a
matter with God, that it should be so rewarded? Is it not more pleasing
to God to see us go stooping than walking upright, seeing stooping is
the gait of humility, than which there is nothing to God more pleasing?
It is no doubt a hard matter to stoop and go upright both at once, yet
both must be done, and both indeed are done, are done at once by every
one that is godly; but when I say they are done both at once, I mean not
of the body, I know two such postures in the body both at once are
impossible; but the soul can do it, the soul can stoop and go upright
both at once; for then doth the soul walk upright before God, when it
stoops in humility before God and men. - Sir Richard Baker.

[Psa 84:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#011.md)

This is an immense fountain; the Lord fill all the buckets of our hearts
at the spring, and give us capacious souls, as he hath a liberal hand. -
Thomas Adams.

[Psalms 84:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 84:1</span></span>

1 How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts!

2 My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the Lord: my
heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.

3 Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for
herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O Lord of
hosts, my King, and my God.

4 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising
thee. Selah.

[Psa 84:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001.md)

"How amiable," or, How lovely! He does not tell us how lovely they were,
because he could not. His expressions show us that his feelings were
inexpressible. Lovely to the memory, to the mind, to the heart, to the
eye, to the whole soul, are the assemblies of the saints. Earth contains
no sight so refreshing to us as the gathering of believers for worship.
Those are sorry saints who see nothing amiable in the services of the
Lord's house. "Are thy tabernacles." The tabernacle had been pitched in
several places, and, moreover, was divided into several courts and
portions; hence, probably, the plural number is here used. It was all
and altogether lovely to David. Outer court, or inner court, he loved
every portion of it. Every cord and curtain was dear to him. Even when
at a distance, he rejoiced to remember the sacred tent where Jehovah
revealed himself, and he cried out with exultation while he pictured in
fond imagination its sacred services, and solemn rites, as he had seen
them in bygone times. Because they are thy tabernacles, "O Lord of
hosts," therefore are they so dear to thy people. Thy pavilion is the
centre of the camp, around which all thy creatures gather, and towards
which their eyes are turned, as armies look to the tent of the king.
Thou rulest all the companies of creatures with such goodness, that all
their hosts rejoice in thy dwelling-place, and the bands of thy saints
especially hail thee with Joyful loyalty as Jehovah of hosts.

[Psa 84:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#002.md)

"My soul longeth," - it pines, and faints to meet with the saints in the
Lord's house. The desire was deep and insatiable - the very soul of the
man was yearning for his God. "Yea, even fainteth;" as though it could
not long hold out, but was exhausted with delay. He had a holy
lovesickness upon him, and was wasted with an inward consumption because
he was debarred the worship of the Lord in the appointed place. "For the
courts of the Lord." To stand once again in those areas which were
dedicated to holy adoration was the soul-longing of the Psalmist. True
subjects love the courts of their king. "My heart and my flesh crieth
out for the living God." It was God himself that he pined for, the only
living and true God. His whole nature entered into his longing. Even the
clay-cold flesh grew warm through the intense action of his fervent
spirit. Seldom, indeed, does the flesh incline in the right direction,
but in the matter of Sabbath services our weary body sometimes comes to
the assistance of our longing heart, for it desires the physical rest as
much as the soul desires the spiritual repose. The Psalmist declared
that he could not remain silent in his desires, but began to cry out for
God and his house; he wept, he sighed, he pleaded for the privilege.
Some need to be whipped to church, while here is David crying for it. He
needed no clatter of bells from the belfry to ring him in, he carried
his bell in his own bosom: holy appetite is a better call to worship
than a full chime.

[Psa 84:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#003.md)

"Yea, the sparrow hath found an house." He envied the sparrows which
lived around the house of God, and picked up the stray crumbs in the
courts thereof; he only wished that he, too, could frequent the solemn
assemblies and bear away a little of the heavenly food. "And the swallow
a nest for herself where she may lay her young." He envied also the
swallows whose nests were built under the eaves of the priests' houses,
who there found a place for their young, as well as for themselves. We
rejoice not only in our personal religious opportunities, but in the
great blessing of taking our children with us to the sanctuary. The
church of God is a house for us and a nest for our little ones. "Even
thine altars, O Lord of hosts." To the very altars these free birds drew
near, none could restrain them nor would have wished to do so, and David
wished to come and go as freely as they did. Mark how he repeats the
blessed name of Jehovah of Hosts; he found in it a sweetness which
helped him to bear his inward hunger. Probably David himself was with
the host, and, therefore, he dwelt with emphasis upon the title which
taught him that the Lord was in the tented field as well as within the
holy curtains. "My King and my God." Here he utters his loyalty from
afar. If he may not tread the courts, yet he loves the King. If an
exile, he is not a rebel. When we cannot occupy a seat in God's house,
he shall have a seat in our memories and a throne in our hearts. The
double "my" is very precious; he lays hold upon his God with both his
hands, as one resolved not to let him go till the favour requested be at
length accorded.

[Psa 84:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#004.md)

"Blessed are they that dwell in thy house." Those he esteems to be
highly favoured who are constantly engaged in divine worship - the
canons residentiary, yea, the pew-openers, the menials who sweep and
dust. To come and go is refreshing, but to abide in the place of prayer
must be heaven below. To be the guests of God, enjoying the
hospitalities of hearer, set apart for holy work, screened from a noisy
world, and familiar with sacred things - why this is surely the choicest
heritage a son of man can possess. "They will be still praising thee."
So near to God, their very life must be adoration. Surely their hearts
and tongues never cease from magnifying the Lord. We fear David here
drew rather a picture of what should be than of what is; for those
occupied daily with the offices needful for public worship are not
always among the most devout; on the contrary, "the nearer the church
the further from God." Yet in a spiritual sense this is most true, for
those children of God who in spirit abide ever in his house, are also
ever full of the praises of God. Communion is the mother of adoration.
They fail to praise the Lord who wander far from him, but those who
dwell in him are always magnifying him.

"Selah." In such an occupation as this we might be content to remain for
ever. It is worth while to pause and meditate upon the prospect of
dwelling with God and praising him throughout eternity.

[Psalms 84:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 84:5</span></span>

5 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the
ways of them.

6 Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also
filleth the pools.

7 They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth
before God.

8 O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.

[Psa 84:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#005.md)

"Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee." Having spoken of the
blessedness of those who reside in the house of God, he now speaks of
those who are favoured to visit it at appointed seasons, going upon
pilgrimage with their devout brethren: he is not, however,
indiscriminate in his eulogy, but speaks only of those who heartily
attend to the sacred festivals. The blessedness of sacred worship
belongs not to half-hearted, listless worshippers, but to those who
throw all their energies into it. Neither prayer, nor praise, nor the
hearing of the word will be pleasant or profitable to persons who have
left their hearts behind them. A company of pilgrims who had left their
hearts at home would be no better than a caravan of carcasses, quite
unfit to blend with living saints in adoring the living God. "In whose
heart are the ways of them," or far better, "in whose heart are thy
ways." Those who love the ways of God are blessed. When we have God's
ways in our hearts, and our heart in his ways, we are what and where we
should be, and hence we shall enjoy the divine approval.

[Psa 84:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#006.md)

"Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well." Traversing
joyfully the road to the great assembly, the happy pilgrims found
refreshment even in the dreariest part of the road. As around a well men
meet and converse cheerfully, being refreshed after their journey, so
even in the vale of tears, or any other dreary glen, the pilgrims to the
skies find sweet solace in brotherly communion and in anticipation of
the general assembly above, with its joys unspeakable. Probably there is
here a local allusion, which will never now be deciphered, but the
general meaning is clear enough. There are joys of pilgrimage which make
men forget the discomforts of the road. "The rain also filleth the
pools." God gives to his people the supplies they need while traversing
the roads which he points out for them. Where there were no natural
supplies from below, the pilgrims found an abundant compensation in
waters from above, and so also shall all the sacramental host of God's
elect. Ways, which otherwise would have been deserted from want of
accommodation, were made into highways abundantly furnished for the
travellers' wants, because the great annual pilgrimages led in that
direction; even so, Christian converse and the joy of united worship
make many duties easy and delightful which else had been difficult and
painful.

[Psa 84:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#007.md)

"They go from strength to strength." So far from being wearied they
gather strength as they proceed. Each individual becomes happier, each
company becomes more numerous, each holy song more sweet and full. We
grow as we advance if heaven be our goal. If we spend our strength in
God's ways we shall find it increase. "Every one of them in Zion
appeareth before God." This was the end of the pilgrims' march, the
centre where all met, the delight of all hearts. Not merely to be in the
assembly, but to appear before God was the object of each devout
Israelite. Would to God it were the sincere desire of all who in these
days mingle in our religious gatherings. Unless we realise the presence
of God we have done nothing; the mere gathering together is nothing
worth.

[Psa 84:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#008.md)

"O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer." Give me to go up to thy house, or
if I may not do so, yet let my cry be heard. Thou listenest to the
united supplications of thy saints, but do not shut out my solitary
petition, unworthy though I be. "Give ear, O God of Jacob." Though
Jehovah of hosts, thou art also the covenant God of solitary pleaders
like Jacob; regard thou, then, my plaintive supplication. I wrestle here
alone with thee, while the company of thy people have gone on before me
to happier scenes, and I beseech thee bless me; for I am resolved to
hold thee till thou speak the word of grace into my soul. The repetition
of the request for an answer to his prayer denotes his eagerness for a
blessing. What a mercy it is that if we cannot gather with the saints,
we can still speak to their Master.

Selah. - A pause was needed after a cry so vehement, a prayer so
earnest.

[Psalms 84:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 84:9</span></span>

9 Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed.

10 For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a
doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of
wickedness.

11 For the Lord God is a sun and shield: the Lord will give grace and
glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.

12 O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.

[Psa 84:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#009.md)

"Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed."
Here we have the nation's prayer for David; and the believer's prayer
for the Son of David. Let but the Lord look upon our Lord Jesus, and we
shall be shielded from all harm; let him behold the face of his
Anointed, and we shall be able to behold his face with joy. We also are
anointed by the Lord's grace, and our desire is that he will look upon
us with an eye of love in Christ Jesus. Our best prayers when we are in
the best place are for our glorious King, and for the enjoyment of his
Father's smile.

[Psa 84:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#010.md)

"For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand." Of course the
Psalmist means a thousand days spent elsewhere. Under the most
favourable circumstances in which earth's pleasures can be enjoyed, they
are not comparable by so much as one in a thousand to the delights of
the service of God. To feel his love, to rejoice in the person of the
anointed Saviour, to survey the promises and feel the power of the Holy
Ghost in applying precious truth to the soul, is a joy which worldlings
cannot understand, but which true believers are ravished with. Even a
glimpse at the love of God is better than ages spent in the pleasures of
sense. "I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to
dwell in the tents of wickedness." The lowest station in connection with
the Lord's house is better than the highest position among the godless.
Only to wait at his threshold and peep within, so as to see Jesus, is
bliss. To bear burdens and open doors for the Lord is more honour than
to reign among the wicked. Every man has his choice, and this is ours.
God's worst is better than the devil's best. God's doorstep is a happier
rest than downy couches within the pavilions of royal sinners, though we
might lie there for a lifetime of luxury. Note how he calls the
tabernacle "the house of my God;" there's where the sweetness lies: if
Jehovah be our God, his house, his altars, his doorstep, all become
precious to us. We know by experience that where Jesus is within, the
outside of the house is better than the noblest chambers where the Son
of God is not to be found.

[Psa 84:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#011.md)

"For the Lord God is a sun and shield." Pilgrims need both as the
weather may be, for the cold would smite them were it not for the sun,
and foes are apt to waylay the sacred caravan, and would haply destroy
it if it were without a shield. Heavenly pilgrims are not left
uncomforted or unprotected. The pilgrim nation found both sun and shield
in that fiery cloudy pillar which was the symbol of Jehovah's presence,
and the Christian still finds both light and shelter in the Lord his
God. A sun for happy days and a shield for dangerous ones. A sun above,
a shield around. A light to show the way and a shield to ward off its
perils. Blessed are they who journey with such a convoy; the sunny and
the shady side of life are alike happy to them. "The Lord will give
grace and glory." Both in due time, both as needed, both to the full,
both with absolute certainty. The Lord has both grace and glory in
infinite abundance; Jesus is the fulness of both, and, as his chosen
people, we shall receive both as a free gift from the God of our
salvation. What more can the Lord give, or we receive, or desire. "No
good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly." Grace makes
us walk uprightly and this secures every covenant blessing to us. What a
wide promise! Some apparent good may be withheld, but no real good, no,
not one. "All things are yours, and ye are Christ's, and Christ is
God's." God has all good, there is no good apart from him, and there is
no good which he either needs to keep back or will on any account refuse
us, if we are but ready to receive it. We must be upright and neither
lean to this or that form of evil: and this uprightness must be
practical, - we must walk in truth and holiness, then shall we be heirs
of all things, and as we come of age all things shall be in our actual
possession; and, meanwhile, according to our capacity for receiving
shall be the measure of the divine bestowal. This is true, not of a
favoured few but of all the saints for evermore.

[Psa 84:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#012.md)

"O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee." Here is the
key of the Psalm. The worship is that of faith, and the blessedness is
peculiar to believers. No formal worshipper can enter into this secret.
A man must know the Lord by the life of real faith, or he can have no
true rejoicing in the Lord's worship, his house, his Son, or his ways.
Dear reader, how fares it with thy soul?
