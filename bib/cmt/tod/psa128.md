### [Psalms Chapter 128](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 128:0</span></span>

Title. - A Song of Degrees. There is an evident ascent from the last
Psalm: that did but hint at the way in which a house may be built up,
but this draws a picture of that house built, and adorned with domestic
bliss through the Lord's own benediction. There is clearly an advance in
age, for here we go beyond children to children's children; and also a
progress in happiness, for children which in the last Psalm were arrows
are here olive plants, and instead of speaking "with the enemies in the
gate" we close with "peace upon Israel." Thus we rise step by step, and
sing as we ascend.

Subject - It is a family hymn, - a song for a marriage, or a birth, or
for any day in which a happy household has met to praise the Lord. Like
all the songs of degrees, it has an eye to Zion and Jerusalem, which are
both expressly mentioned, and it closes like [Psa
125:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#001), [Psa
130:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#001), and [Psa
131:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001), with an allusion to Israel.
It is a short Psalm, but exceedingly full and suggestive. Its poetry is
of the highest order. Perhaps in no country can it be better understood
than in our own, for we above all nations delight to sing of "Home,
sweet home."

Hints to Preachers

[Psa 128:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#001). - The universality of the
blessedness of God-fearing men. Circumstances, personal or relative,
cannot alter the blessing; nor age, nor public opinion, nor even their
own sense of unworthiness.

[Psa 128:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#001). - Consider:

I. The union of a right fear with a right walk.

1\. There is a wrong fear, because slavish; this never can lead to
genuine obedience, which must be willingly and cheerfully rendered.

2\. But the fear of reverence and filial love will surely turn the feet
to God's ways, keep them steadfast therein, and wing them with speed.

II\. The blessedness of him in whom they are united.

1\. It is blessedness of life; for that is prospered.

2\. It is blessedness of domestic happiness; for where the head of a
family is holy, the family is the home of peace.

3\. It is the blessedness of a holy influence in every sphere of his
activity.

4\. It is deep-felt heart-blessedness in walking with God.

5\. And all is but a prelude to the everlasting blessedness of heaven. -
J. F.

[Psa 128:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#002). - The blessednesses of the
righteous are first generalized, then particularized. Here they are
divided into three particulars.

I. The fruit of past labours.

II\. Present enjoyment.

III\. Future welfare, "It shall be well with thee." Well in time; well
in death; well at the last judgment; well for ever. - G. R.

[Psa 128:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#002). -

I. Labour a blessing to him who fears God.

II\. The fruits of labour the result of God's blessing.

III\. The enjoyment of the fruits of labour a further blessing from God.
- W. H. J. P.

[Psa 128:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#002) (first clause). - Success
in life.

I. Its source - God's blessing.

II\. Its channel - our own labour.

III\. The measure in which it is promised - as much as we can eat. More
is above the promise.

IV\. The enjoyment. We are permitted to eat or enjoy our labour.

[Psa 128:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#002) (second clause). - Godly
happiness.

I. Follows upon God's blessing.

II\. Grows out of character: "feareth the Lord."

III\. Follows labour: see preceding sentence.

IV\. It is supported by well-being: see following sentence.

[Psa 128:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#002) (last clause). -

I. It shall be well with thee while thou livest.

II\. It shall be better with thee when thou diest.

III\. It shall be best of all with thee in eternity. - Adapted from
Matthew Henry.

[Psa 128:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#003). - The blessing of
children.

I. They are round our table - expense, anxiety, responsibility,
pleasure.

II\. They are like olive plants - strong, planted in order, coming on to
succeed us, fruitful for God - as the olive provided oil for the lamp.

[Psa 128:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#003). - A complete family
picture. Here are the husband, the wife, the children, the house, the
rooms in the side, the table. We should ask a blessing upon each, bless
God for each, and use each in a blessed manner.

[Psa 128:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#004). - Domestic happiness the
peculiar blessing of piety. Show how it produces and maintains it.

[Psa 128:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#005). - The blessing out of
Zion. See [Num 6:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#024).

[Psa 128:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#005). - Two priceless mercies.

I. The house of God a blessing to our house. It is connected with our
own salvation, edification, consolation, etc. It is our hope for the
conversion of our children and servants, etc. It is the place of their
education, and for the formation of helpful friendship, etc.

II\. Our house a blessing to God's house. Personal interest in the
church, hospitality, generosity, service, etc. Children aiding holy
work. Wife useful, etc.

[Psa 128:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#006). - Old age blessed when -

I. Life has been spent in the fear of God.

II\. When it is surrounded to its close by human affection.

III\. When it maintains its interest in the cause of God. - W. H. J. P.

[Psa 128:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#006) (last clause). - Church
peace - its excellence, its enemies, its friends, its fruits.

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Whole Psalm

[Psa 128:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#001) follows [Psa
127:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#001) for the same reason as [Psa
2:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001) follows [Psa
1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001). In both instances they are
Psalms placed together, of which one begins with ashrê (happy, very
happy), and the other ends with ashrê. In other respects [Psa
128:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#001) and [Psa
127:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#001) supplement one another. They
are related to one another much as the New Testament parables of the
treasure in the field and the one pearl are related. That which makes
man happy is represented in [Psa
127:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#001) as a gift coming as a
blessing, and in [Psa 127:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#001) as a
reward coming as a blessing, that which is briefly indicated in the word
שׂכר, sakar, reward, in [Psa 127:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#003)
being here expanded and unfolded. There it appears as a gift of grace in
contrast to the God-estranged self-activity of man; here as a fruit of
the ora et labora. - Franz Delitzsch.

Whole Psalm

It is to be observed, that here all men are spoken to as wedded; because
this is the ordinary estate of most people. See [Co1
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#001), [Co1
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#002). At this day every Jew is bound to
marry at about eighteen years of age, or before twenty; else he is
accounted as one that liveth in sin. - John Trapp.

Whole Psalm

This Psalm is an έπιθαλαμιος λογος, written for the commendation,
instruction, and consolation of those who are either already married or
are about to enter on that kind of life. It enumerates, therefore, at
the commencement, as is usual in songs of this kind, al, those things
which are regarded as burdens in the married life, such as the labours
in seeking to provide for the whole family; the spouse, and that
marriage bond, which, as it were, binds a man and seems to make him a
slave, just as that character says in the comedy, "I have taken a wife;
I have sold my liberty" lastly, the education of the children, which
certainly is most laborious, and requires the largest expenditure. To
lighten the burden of all these things, there is added to each a
blessing, or a promise, so that they might appear slight. And at the
close, it subjoins in general, a spiritual promise, which easily makes
light of all the labours and disquiets of the married life; even if they
should be the very heaviest. The blessing comes from Zion or the Church:
for there is nothing so burdensome and difficult, but what it can be
easily borne by those who are members of the true Church, and know the
sources of true consolation. - D. H. Mollerus.

[Psa 128:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#001)

"Blessed is every one that feareth the Lord," etc. Here we have the
living fountain of the blessing which rests upon the conjugal and
domestic state. When worldly prudence attempts to choose a wife and form
a household, it can apply its hand only to so much of the work as has
its seat upon earth, and is visible to the eye of sense. It builds, so
to speak, the first and the second story, adds cornice and pediment, and
the fabric presents a fair appearance - but it has no foundation.
Whenever you see the household of a married pair continuing to defy
every storm, you may be sure that it rests upon a sure foundation, lying
beyond the reach of human sense, and that that foundation is the fear of
the Lord. To the fear of the Lord, therefore, the holy Psalmist has
wisely given a place in front of this beautiful Psalm which celebrates
the blessing that descends upon conjugal and domestic life. - Augustus
F. Tholuck, in "Hours of Christian Devotion," 1870.

[Psa 128:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#001)

"Blessed is every one that feareth the Lord." There is a fear of the
Lord which hath terror in it and not blessedness. The apprehension with
which a warring rebel regards his triumphant and offended sovereign, or
the feelings of a fraudulent bankrupt towards a stern creditor, or, a
conscience-striken criminal to a righteous judge, are frequently types
of men's feelings in regard to God. This evidently cannot be the fear
which the "blessed" of this Psalm feel. Nor can theirs, on the other
hand, be the tormenting fear of self-reproach.

Their fear is that which the believed revelations given of him in his
Word produce. It is the fear which a child feels towards an honoured
parent; - a fear to offend: it is that which they who have been rescued
from destruction feel to the benefactor who nobly and at the vastest
sacrifice interposed for their safety, - a fear to act unworthily of his
kindness' it is that which fills the breast of a pardoned and grateful
rebel in the presence of a venerated sovereign at whose throne he is
permitted to stand in honour, - a fear lest he should ever forget his
goodness, and give him cause to regret it. Such is the fear of the
Christian now: a fear which reverence for majesty, gratitude for
mercies, dread of displeasure, desire of approval, and longing for the
fellowship of heaven, inspire; the fear of angels and the blessed Son;
the fear not of sorrow but of love, which shrinks with instinctive
recoil from doing aught that would tend to grieve, or from denying aught
that would tend to honour. Religion is the grand and the only wisdom;
and since the beginning, the middle, and the end-of it, is the fear of
the Lord, blessed is every man that is swayed by it. - Robert Nisbet, in
"The Sons of the Temple Pilgrims," 1863.

[Psa 128:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#001)

"Blessed is every one that feareth the Lord." Let us take a little of
the character of the blessed man. Who is it that is undaunted? "The man
that feareth God." Fear sounds rather contrary to blessedness; hath an
air of misery; but add whom. He that feareth the Lord"; that touch turns
it into gold. He that so fears, fears not: he shall not be afraid; all
petty fears are swallowed up in this great fear; and this great fear is
as sweet and pleasing as little fears are anxious and vexing. Secure of
other things, he can say - "If my God be pleased, no matter who is
displeased; no matter who despise me, if he account me his. Though all
forsake me, though my dearest friends grow estranged, if he reject me
not, that is my only fear; and for that I am not perplexed, I know he
will not." A believer hath no fear but of the displeasure of heaven, the
anger of God to fall upon him; he accounts that only terrible; but yet
he doth not fear it, doth not apprehend it will fall on him, is better
persuaded of the goodness of God. So this fear is still joined with
trust, "Behold the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, upon them
that hope in his mercy"; [Psa 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#018). -
Robert Leighton, 1611-1684.

[Psa 128:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#001)

"Blessed is every one," etc. There is a stress on all ("every one"),
teaching that no disparity of sex or condition, of rank or wealth,
affects the degree of happiness granted by God to every one of his true
servants in their several stations it is to be observed, further, that
whenever the fear of the Lord is mentioned in Holy Writ, it is never set
by itself, as though sufficient for the consummation of our faith, but
always has something added or prefixed, by which to estimate its due
proportion of perfection, according as it is stated by Solomon in the
Proverbs ([Pro 2:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#003)). - J. M. Neale
and R. F. Littledale, in "A Commentary on the Psalms from Primitive and
Medieval Writers," 1860.

[Psa 128:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#001)

"Blessed is every one" etc. It is a precious promise, but perhaps thou
art tempted to say in thy heart, not meant for everyone. Wilt thou
answer against the Lord? Hear him speak in the song. He says, "every
one." "Blessed is every one that feareth the Lord." None are excluded
but those who will not walk in his ways. - Edward Jewitt Robinson.

[Psa 128:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#001)

"Blessed," etc. The adage, "That it is best not to be born at all, or to
die as soon as possible," has certainly been long since received by the
common consent of almost all men. Carnal reason judges either that all
mankind without exception are miserable, or that fortune is more
favourable to ungodly and wicked men than to the good. To the sentiment
that those are blessed who fear the Lord, it has an entire aversion. So
much the more requisite, then, is it to dwell upon the consideration of
this truth. Farther, as this blessedness is not apparent to the eye, it
is of importance, in order to our being able to apprehend it, first to
attend to the definition which will be given of it by-and-bye; and
secondly, to know that it depends chiefly upon the protection of God.
Although we collect together all the circumstances which seem to
contribute to a happy life, surely nothing will be found more desirable
than to be kept hidden under the guardianship of God. If this blessing
is, in our estimation, to be preferred, as it deserves, to all other
good things, whoever is persuaded that the care of God is exercised
about the world and human affairs, will at the same time unquestionably
acknowledge that what is here laid down is the chief point of happiness.
- John Calvin.

[Psa 128:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#001)

"That feareth the Lord; that walketh in his ways." The fear of the Lord
is the internal principle; but unless there be a corresponding
expression in the outward life, what reason is there to suppose that it
has any existence at all?

Observe also, that there is no walking in the ways of the Lord, until
his fear be established in the heart. There can be no genuine morality
apart from the fear of God. How can a man obey God while his affections
are alienated from him? - N. M.'Michael.

[Psa 128:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#001)

"That walketh in his ways." God makes blessed those that walk in his
ways, because he himself walks with them. This is said concerning David,
and it is explained how that companionship blessed him, [Sa2
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#010), "And David went on, and grew
great, and the Lord God of hosts was with him": where the "and" may be
taken as the causal particle "because." That God does indeed join
himself to those who walk in his ways as companion and leader we have in
[Ch2 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#003), [Ch2
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#004) : "And the Lord was with
Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David,
and sought not unto Baalim; but sought to the Lord God of his father." -
Thomas Le Blanc.

[Psa 128:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#002)

"For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands," etc. There is a fourfold
literal sense here: Thou shalt live by honest, peaceful labour, not by
rapine and violence on that produced by the toil of others, nor yet
indolently and luxuriously; thou shalt "eat," and not penuriously stint
thyself and others; thy crops shall not be blighted, but shall bring
forth abundantly; and no enemy shall destroy or carry off thy harvest.
And these two latter interpretations accord best with the converse
punishments threatened to the disobedient by Moses. "Thou shalt eat the
labour of thine hands." But he who hates labour does not eat of it, nor
can he say, "My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to
finish his work" - [Joh 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#034). On the
other hand, he to whom such labour is a delight, does not merely look
forward in hope to the future fruits or rewards of labour, but even here
and now finds sustenance and pleasure in toiling for God; so that it is
"well" with him in the world, even amidst all its cares and troubles,
and he "shall be happy" in that which is to come, whence sorrow is
banished for ever, as it is written in the gospel, "Blessed is he that
shall eat bread in the kingdom of God": [Luk
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#015). - Neale and Littledale.

[Psa 128:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#002)

"Thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands," etc. This must they learn
also which are married, that they must labour. For the law of nature
requireth that the husband should sustain and nourish his wife and his
children. For after that man and wife do know that they ought to fear
God their Creator, who not only made them, but gave his blessing also
unto his creature; this secondly must they know, that something they
must do that they consume not their days in ease and idleness. Hesiod,
the poet, giveth his counsel, that first thou shouldst get thee a house,
then a wife, and also an ox to till the ground for albeit that our
diligence, care, and travail is not able to maintain our family, yet God
useth such as a means by the which he will bless us. - Martin Luther.

[Psa 128:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#002)

"Thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands." Men have dreamed fascinating
dreams of removing the disabilities and limitations of the world and the
evils of life, without sorrow. Poets have pictured earthly paradises,
where life would be one long festival, -

"Summer isles of Eden lying in dark purple spheres of sea."

But vain are all such dreams and longings. They are of human, not of
Divine origin, and spring from a root of selfishness and not of
holiness. They cannot be realized in a fallen world, full of sorrow
because full of sin. All blessings in man's economy are got from pains.
Happiness is the flower that grows from a thorn of sorrow transformed by
man's cultivation. The beautiful myth which placed the golden apples of
the Hesperides in a garden guarded by dragons, is an allegory
illustrative of the great human fact, that not till we have slain the
dragons of selfishness and sloth can we obtain any of the golden
successes of life. Supposing it were possible that we could obtain the
objects of our desire without any toil or trouble, we should not enjoy
them. To benefit us really, they must be the growths of our own
self-denial and labour. And this is the great lesson which the miracles
of our Lord, wrought in the manner in which they were, unfolded. They
teach us that, in both temporal and spiritual things, we should not so
throw ourselves upon the providence or grace of God as to neglect the
part we have ourselves to act, - that God crowns every honest and
faithful effort of man with success, "Blessed is every one that feareth
the Lord; that walketh in his ways. For thou shalt eat the labour of
thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee." -
Hugh Macmillan, in "The Ministry of Nature," 1871.

[Psa 128:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#002) (first clause)

Labour, the symbol of man's punishment;

Labour, the secret of man's happiness.

James Montgomery, 1771-1854.

[Psa 128:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#002)

"Happy shalt thou be." Oh trust in the Lord for happiness as well as for
help! All the springs of happiness are in him. Trust "in him who giveth
us all things richly to enjoy"; who, of his own rich and free mercy,
holds them out to us, as in his own hand, that, receiving them as his
gifts, and as pledges of his love, we may enjoy all that we possess. It
is his love gives a relish to all we taste, puts life and sweetness into
all; while every creature leads us up to the great Creator, and all
earth is a scale to heaven. He transfuses the joys that are at his own
right hand into all that he bestows on his thankful children, who,
having fellowship with the Father and his Son Jesus Christ, enjoy him in
all and above all. - John Wesley, 1703-1791.

[Psa 128:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#002)

"Happy shalt thou be." Mr. Disraeli puts these remarkable words into the
mouth of one of his characters: "Youth is a blunder; manhood a struggle;
old age a regret." A sad and cheerless view of life's progress that! It
may be true, in measure, of a life separated from godliness; it
certainly is not true of a life allied with godliness. Let there be
"life and godliness," and then youth is not a blunder, but a wise
purpose and a glowing hope; manhood is not a struggle only, but a
conquest and a joy; old age is not a regret, but a rich memory and a
glorious prospect. - R. P. Macmaster, in "The Baptist Magazine," 1878.

[Psa 128:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#003)

"Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine," etc. The comparison would
perhaps be brought out more clearly by arranging the verse as follows: -

"Thy wife shall be in the inner part of thy house

Like a fruitful vine;

Thy children round about thy table

Like the shoots of the olive."

In the inner part, literally, "the sides of thy house," as in [Amo
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#010), i.e., the women's apartments, as
marking the proper sphere of the wife engaged in her domestic duties,
and also to some extent her seclusion, though this was far less amongst
the Jews than amongst other Orientals.

The "vine" is an emblem chiefly of fruitfulness, but perhaps also of
dependence, as needing support; the "olive," of vigorous, healthy,
joyous life. The same figure is employed by Euripides, Here. Fur., 839.
Med. 1098. - J. J. Stewart Perowne.

[Psa 128:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#003)

"Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine," etc. We do not remember to have
met with a single instance, in the East, of vines trained against the
walls of a house, or of olives near or about a house. Neither have we
read of such instances. The passage doubtless derives its figures from
the fertility of the vine, and from the appearance of the olive, or the
order in which olive trees are planted. The construction would then be,
"Thy wife, in the sides (interior apartments) of thy house, shall be as
the fruitful vine, and thy children round about thy table, like olive
plants." - John Kitto (1804-1854), in "The Pictorial Bible."

[Psa 128:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#003)

"Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house." The
wife is likened not to thorns or briers, nor even to oaks or to other
fruits and trees, but to the vine; and also to a vine neither in a
vineyard nor in a garden, but set by the walls of the house; also not
barren, but fertile and fruit-bearing. This admonishes husbands as well
as wives of their duties. For as the walls support the vine, and defend
it against the force of winds and tempests, so ought husbands, as far as
is in their power, to defend their wives by their godly conversation and
wholesome teachings and institutions against the pestilential wind of
the old serpent; also against the injuries of evil-disposed men. "He
that loveth his wife loveth himself. For no man ever yet hated his own
flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the Church":
[Eph 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#028), [Eph
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#029).

Further, the vine is exceedingly fragile wood, and not meet for any
work, [Eze 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#004). Husbands, therefore,
should remember that they ought to behave towards their wives patiently
and prudently, as with the weaker vessel; not keeping in mind the
fragility of the wood, but the abundance and sweetness of the fruit. If
husbands observe this, that will happen to them which Scripture says
concerning the peaceful time of Solomon, "And Judah and Israel dwelt
safely, every man under his vine and under his fig-tree", [Kg1
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#025). Such was the married life of
Abraham with Sarah, Isaac with Rebecca, Jacob with Leah and Rachel. -
Solomon Gesner.

[Psa 128:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#003)

"A fruitful vine by the sides of thine house." It does not say on the
sides of the house, but by the sides. The passage probably refers to the
trellissed bowers which often lead up to the houses, and are covered
with vines, the grapes hanging over head. Sitting in these bowers is
sitting under our own vines: [Mic 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#004).
I have seen in Constantinople grapes hanging over the people's heads in
the principal streets, the vines being trained from one side of the
street to the other. - John Gadsby, in "My Wanderings," 1860.

[Psa 128:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#003)

"By the sides of thine house." Not on the roof, nor on the floor; the
one is too high, she is no ruler; the other too low, she is no slave,
but in the sides, an equal place between both. - Thomas Adams.

[Psa 128:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#003)

"By the sides of thine house." The house is her proper place; for she is
"the beauty of the house"; there her business lies, there she is safe.
The ancients painting them with a snail under their feet, and the
Egyptians denying their women shoes, and the Scythians burning the
bride's chariot axle-tree at her door, when she was brought to her
husband's house, and the angel's asking Abraham where Sarah was (though
he knew well enough), that it might be observed, she was "in the tent,"
do all intimate, that, by the law of nature, and by the rules of
religion, the wife ought to keep at home, unless urgent necessity do
call her abroad. - Richard Steele ( - 1692), in "The Morning Exercises."

[Psa 128:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#003)

As it is visible that the good man's sons being "like olive plants round
about his table," means not that they should be like the olive plants
which grew round his table, it being, I presume, a thought in Bishop
Patrick that will not be defended, that the Psalmist refers to a table
spread in an arbour composed of young olive trees, for we find no such
arbours ill the Levant, nor is the tree very proper for such a purpose;
so in like manner the first clause must signify, thy wife shall be in
the sides, or private apartments, of thy house, fruitful as a thriving
vine: the place here mentioned (the sides of the house) referring to the
wife, not to the vine; as the other (the table) refers to the children,
not to the olives. Nor is this a new thought, it is a remark that
Musculus and other interpreters have made.

The Hebrew word, translated sides, is very well known to signify the
more private apartments of a house, as they have also remarked; and he
that reads Dr. Shaw's description of an Eastern house, must immediately
see the propriety of calling the private apartments its sides. Such a
house consists of a square court, which the doctor observes, is called
the midst of the house: and private apartments round it, which may as
properly be called its sides in consequence: into this middle of the
house, or this quadrangle, company, he tells us, are sometimes received,
in which other authors tell us their wives remain concealed at such
times. - Thomas Harmer, 1719-1788.

[Psa 128:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#003)

"Thy children like olive plants," etc. Follow me into the grove, and I
will show you what may have suggested the comparison. Here we have hit
upon a beautiful illustration. This aged and decayed tree is surrounded,
as you see, by several young and thrifty shoots, which spring from the
root of the venerable parent. They seem to uphold, protect, and embrace
it, we may even fancy that they now bear that load of fruit which would
otherwise be demanded of the feeble parent. Thus do good and
affectionate children gather round the table of the righteous. Each
contributes something to the common wealth and welfare of the whole - a
beautiful sight, with which may God refresh the eyes of every friend of
mine. - W. M. Thomson.

[Psa 128:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#003)

Man by nature, uninfluenced by grace, is "a wild olive tree"; and the
object of most parents is merely to cultivate this wild olive tree. What
anxiety is there about accomplishments which, how attractive soever, are
but the dying blossoms of this wild olive tree! - Richard Cecil,
1748-1810.

[Psa 128:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#003)

Although the world is carried away by irregular desires after various
objects, between which it is perpetually fluctuating in its choice, God
gives us in this Psalm a description of what he considers to be a
blessing beyond all riches, and therefore we ought to hold it in high
estimation. If a man has a wife of amiable manners as the companion of
his life, let him set no less value upon this blessing than Solomon did,
who, in [Pro 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#014), affirms that it is
God alone who gives a good wife. In like manner, if a man be a father of
a numerous offspring, let him receive that goodly boon with a thankful
heart. - John Calvin.

[Psa 128:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#003)

Before the fall Paradise was man's home; since the fall home has been
his Paradise. - Augustus William Hare (1792-1834), and Julius Charles
Hare (1795-1855), in "Guesses at Truth."

[Psa 128:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#004)

As Haman caused it to be proclaimed ([Est
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#009)), "Thus shall it be done to the
man whom the king delighteth to honour"; so here, "Behold, that thus
shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord." He shall be blessed in
his wife, and blessed in his children; so blessed in both that the
Psalmist calls all to behold it, as a rare, beautiful, yea, wonderful
sight: "Behold, thus shall the man be blessed." And yet the man fearing
God shall be blessed more than thus: his blessing shall come in the best
way ([Psa 128:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#005)): "The Lord shall
bless thee out of Zion"; his temporal mercies shall come in a spiritual
way, yea, he shall have spiritual blessings: "He shall bless thee out of
Zion"; and he shall have blessings beyond his own walls: "Thou shalt see
the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life. Yea, thou shalt see thy
children's children, and peace upon Israel." Sometimes a good man can
take no content in his family mercies because of the church's
afflictions; he "prefers Jerusalem above his chief joy" ([Psa
137:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#006)), and while that is mourning he
cannot but be sorrowing, though his own house be full of joy. Sometimes
a man's own family is so afflicted, and his house so full of sorrow,
that he cannot but mourn, even when Jerusalem rejoiceth and Zion is
glad. But when a good man looks home to his own house and sees good
there; when also he looks abroad to Jerusalem and sees good there too,
how full is his joy! how complete is his blessedness I and, "Behold,
thus the man is blessed that feareth the Lord." - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 128:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#004)

"Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed," etc. It is asserted with a
note commanding attention: behold it by faith in the promise; behold it
by observation in the performance of the promise; behold it with
assurance that it shall be so, for God is faithful; and with admiration
that it should be so; for we merit no favour, no blessing from him. -
Matthew Henry.

[Psa 128:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#005)

"Thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem," etc. What is added concerning
"the good of Jerusalem" is to be regarded as enjoining upon the godly
the duty not only of seeking their own individual welfare, or of being
devoted to their own peculiar interests; but rather of having it as
their chief desire to see the church of God in a flourishing condition.
It would be a very unreasonable thing for each member to desire what may
be profitable for itself, while in the meantime the body was neglected.
From our extreme proneness to err in this respect, the prophet, with
good reason, recommends solicitude about the public welfare; and he
mingles together domestic blessings and the common benefits of the
church in such a way as to show us that they are things joined together,
and which it is unlawful to put asunder. - John Calvin.

[Psa 128:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#006)

Lord, let thy blessing so accompany my endeavours in their breedings,
that all my sons may be Benaiahs, the Lord's building, and then they
will all be Abners, their father's light; and that all my daughters may
be Bethias, the Lord's daughters, and then they will all be Abigails,
their father's joy. - George Swinnock.

[Psa 128:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#006)

Religion is as favourable for long life as for happiness. She promotes
long life by destroying those evils, the tendency of which is to limit
the duration of human existence. War sweeps millions into a premature
grave. Men live longer in Christian than in heathen countries. They live
longer in Protestant than in Roman Catholic countries. The direct effect
of true religion is to increase the period of human life. "Length of
days is in her right hand." - N. M.'Michael.

[Psa 128:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#006)

Connecting this with the next Psalm we find the following in a famous
Scotch divine: - "'Peace upon Israel.' The great blessing of peace,
which the Lord hath promised to his people even in this life, (for where
the Lord gives mercy to any, he gives them peace also, peace and grace
are inseparably joined together,) this peace, I say, does not consist in
this, that the people of God shall have no enemies; no, for there is an
immortal and endless enmity against them. Neither does their peace
consist in this, that their enemies shall not assault them; neither does
it consist in this, that their enemies shall not molest or afflict them.
We do but deceive ourselves if so be that we imagine, so long as we are
in this our pilgrimage, and in our warfare here, if we promise to
ourselves a peace of this kind; for while we live in this world, we
shall still have enemies, and these enemies shall assault us, and
persecute and afflict us." - Alexander Henderson.

[Psalms 128:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 128:1</span></span>

1 Blessed is everyone that feareth the Lord; that walketh in his ways.

2 For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands; happy shalt thou be, and
it shall be well with thee.

3 Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house, thy
children like olive plants round about thy table.

4 Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord.

5 The Lord shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of
Jerusalem all the days of thy life.

6 Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, and peace upon Israel.

[Psa 128:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#001)

"Blessed is every one that feareth the Lord." The last Psalm ended with
a blessing, - for the word there translated "happy" is the same as that
which is here rendered "blessed"' thus the two songs are joined by a
catch-word. There is also in them a close community of subject. The fear
of God is the corner-stone of all blessedness. We must reverence the
ever-blessed God before we can be blessed ourselves. Some think that
this life is an evil, an infliction, a thing upon which rests a curse;
but it is not so, the God-fearing man has a present blessing resting
upon him. It is not true that it would be to him "something better not
to be." He is happy now, for he is the child of the happy God, the
ever-living Jehovah; and he is even here a joint-heir with Jesus Christ,
whose heritage is not misery, but joy. This is true of every one of the
God-fearing, of all conditions, in all ages: each one and every one is
blessed. Their blessedness may not always be seen by carnal reason, but
it is always a fact, for God himself declares that it is so; and we know
that those whom he blesses are blessed indeed. Let us cultivate that
holy filial fear of Jehovah which is the essence of all true religion; -
the fear of reverence, of dread to offend, of anxiety to please, and of
entire submission and obedience. This fear of the Lord is the fit
fountain of holy living, we look in vain for holiness apart from it:
none but those who fear the Lord will ever walk in his ways.

"That walketh in his ways." The religious life, which God declares to be
blessed, must be practical as well as emotional. It is idle to talk of
fearing the Lord if we act like those who have no care whether there be
a God or no. God's ways will be our ways if we have a sincere reverence
for him: if the heart is joined unto God, the feet will follow hard
after him. A man's heart will be seen in his walk, and the blessing will
come where heart and walk are both with God. Note that the first Psalm
links the benediction with the walk in a negative way, "Blessed is the
man that walketh not," etc.; but here we find it in connection with the
positive form of our conversation. To enjoy the divine blessing we must
be active, and walk; we must be methodical, and walk in certain ways;
and we must be godly, and walk in the Lord's ways. God's ways are
blessed ways; they were cast up by the Blessed One, they were trodden by
him in whom we are blessed, they are frequented by the blessed, they are
provided with means of blessing, they are paved with present blessings,
and they lead to eternal blessedness: who would not desire to walk in
them?

[Psa 128:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#002)

"For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands." The general doctrine of
[Psa 128:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#001) here receives a personal
application note the change to the second person - "thou shalt eat,"
etc. This is the portion of God's saints, - to work, and to find a
reward in so doing. God is the God of labourers. We are not to leave our
worldly callings because the Lord has called us by grace, we are not
promised a blessing upon romantic idleness or unreasonable dreaming, but
upon hard work and honest industry. Though we are in God's hands we are
to be supported by our own hands. He will give us daily bread, but it
must be made our own by labour. All kinds of labour are here included;
for if one toils by the sweat of his brow, and another does so by the
sweat of his brain, there is no difference in the blessing; save that it
is generally more healthy to work with the body than with the mind only.
Without God it would be vain to labour; but when we are labourers
together with God a promise is set before us. The promise is that labour
shall be fruitful, and that he who performs it shall himself enjoy the
recompense of it. It is a grievous ill for a man to slave his life away
and receive no fair remuneration for his toil, as a rule, God's servants
rise out of such bondage and claim their own, and receive it: at any
rate, this verse may encourage them to do so. "The labourer is worthy of
his hire." Under the Theocracy the chosen people could see this promise
literally fulfilled; but when evil rulers oppressed them their earnings
were withheld by churls, and their harvests were snatched away from them
by marauders. Had they walked in the fear of the Lord they would never
have known such great evils. Some men never enjoy their labour, for they
give themselves no time for rest. Eagerness to get takes from them the
ability to enjoy. Surely, if it is worth while to labour, it is worth
while to eat of that labour. "Happy shalt thou be," or, Oh, thy
happiness. Heaped up happinesses in the plural belong to that man who
fears the Lord. He is happy, and he shall be happy in a thousand ways.
The context leads us to expect family happiness. Our God is our
household God. The Romans had their Lares and Penates, but we have far
more than they in the one only living and true God. "And it shall be
well with thee," or good for thee. Yes, good is for the good; and it
shall be well with those who do well.

"What cheering words are these!

Their sweetness who can tell?

In time, and to eternal days,

'Tis with the righteous well."

If we fear God we may dismiss all other fear. In walking in God's ways
we shall be under his protection, provision, and approval; danger and
destruction shall be far from us' all things shall work our good. In
God's view it would not be a blessed thing for us to live without
exertion, nor to eat the unearned bread of dependence the happiest state
on earth is one in which we have something to do, strength to do it
with, and a fair return for what we have done. This, with the divine
blessing, is all that we ought to desire, and it is sufficient for any
man who fears the Lord and abhors covetousness. Having food and raiment,
let us be therewith content.

[Psa 128:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#003)

"Thy wife." To reach the full of earthly felicity a man must not be
alone. A helpmeet was needed in Paradise, and assuredly she is not less
necessary out of it. He that findeth a wife findeth a good thing. It is
not every man that feareth the Lord who has a wife; but if he has, she
shall share in his blessedness and increase it.

"Shall be as a fruitful vine." To complete domestic bliss children are
sent. They come as the lawful fruit of marriage, even as clusters appear
upon the vine. For the grapes the vine was planted; for children was the
wife provided. It is generally well with any creature when it fulfills
its purpose, and it is so far well with married people when the great
design of their union is brought about. They must not look upon
fruitfulness as a burden, but as a blessing. Good wives are also
fruitful in kindness, thrift, helpfulness, and affection: if they bear
no children, they are by no means barren if they yield us the wine of
consolation and the clusters of comfort. Truly blessed is the man whose
wife is fruitful in those good works which are suitable to her near and
dear position.

"By the sides of thine house." She keeps to the house: she is a home
bird. Some imagine that she is like a vine which is nailed up to the
house wall; but they have no such custom in Palestine, neither is it
pleasant to think of a wife as growing up by a wall, and as bound to the
very bricks and mortar of her husband's dwelling. No, she is a fruitful
vine, and a faithful house-keeper; if you wish to find her, she is
within the house - she is to be found both inside and outside the home,
but her chief fruitfulness is in the inner side of the dwelling, which
she adorns a Eastern houses usually have an open square in the centre,
and the various rooms are ranged around the sides, - there shall the
wife be found, busy in one room or another, as the hour of the day
demands. She keeps at home, and so keeps the home. It is her husband's
house, and she is her husband's; as the text puts it - "thy wife," and
"thy house"; but by her loving care her husband is made so happy that he
is glad to own her as an equal proprietor with himself, for he is hers,
and the house is hers too.

"Thy children like olive plants round about thy table." Hundreds of
times have I seen the young olive plants springing up around the parent
stem, and it has always made me think of this verse. The Psalmist never
intended to suggest the idea of olive plants round a table, but of young
people springing up around their parents, even as olive plants surround
the fine, well-rooted tree. The figure is very striking, and would be
sure to present itself to the mind of every observer in the olive
country. How beautiful to see the gnarled olive, still bearing abundant
fruit, surrounded with a little band of sturdy successors, any one of
which would be able to take its place should the central olive be blown
down, or removed in any other way. The notion of a table in a bower may
suit a cockney in a tea-garden, but would never occur to an oriental
poet; it is not the olive plants, but the children, that are round about
the table. Moreover, note that it is not olive branches, but plants, - a
very different thing. Our children gather around our table to be fed,
and this involves expenses: how much better is this than to see them
pining upon beds of sickness, unable to come for their meals! What a
blessing to have sufficient to put upon the table! Let us for this
benefit praise the bounty of the Lord. The wife is busy all over the
house, but the youngsters are busiest at meal-times; and if the blessing
of the Lord rest upon the family, no sight can be more delightful. Here
we have the vine and the olive blended - joy from the fruitful wife, and
solid comfort from the growing family; these are the choicest products
earth can yield, our families are gardens of the Lord. It may help us to
value the privileges of our home if we consider where we should be if
they were withdrawn. What if the dear partner of our life were removed
from the sides of our house to the recesses of the sepulchre? What is
the trouble of children compared with the sorrow of their loss? Think,
dear father, what would be your grief if you had to cry with Job, "Oh
that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me;
when my children were about me."

[Psa 128:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#004)

"Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord." Mark
this. Put a Nota Bene against it, for it is worthy of observation. It is
not to be inferred that all blessed men are married, and are fathers;
but that this is the way in which the Lord favours godly people who are
placed in domestic life. He makes their relationships happy and
profitable. In this fashion does Jehovah bless God-fearing households,
for he is the God of all the families of Israel. We have seen this
blessing scores of times, and we have never ceased to admire in domestic
peace the sweetest of human felicity. Family blessedness comes from the
Lord, and is a part of his plan for the preservation of a godly race,
and for the maintence of his worship in the land. To the Lord alone we
must look for it. The possession of riches will not ensure it; the
choice of a healthy and beautiful bride will not ensure it; the birth of
numerous comely children will not ensure it: there must be the blessing
of God, the influence of piety, the result of holy living.

[Psa 128:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#005)

"The Lord shall bless thee out of Zion." A spiritual blessing shall be
received by the gracious man, and this shall crown all his temporal
mercies. He is one among the many who make up God's inheritance; his
tent is part and parcel of the encampment around the tabernacle; and
therefore when the benediction is pronounced at the centre it shall
radiate to him in his place. The blessing of the house of God shall be
upon his house. The priestly benediction which is recorded in [Num
6:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#024), runs thus: "The Lord bless
thee, and keep thee: the Lord make his face shine upon thee, and be
gracious unto thee, the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give
thee peace." This is it which shall come upon the head of the
God-fearing man. Zion was the centre of blessing, and to it the people
looked when they sought for mercy, from the altar of sacrifice, from the
mercy-seat, from the Shekinah-light, yea, from Jehovah himself, the
blessing shall come to each one of his holy people. "And thou shalt see
the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life." He shall have a
patriot's joy as well as a patriarch's peace. God shall give him to see
his country prosper, and its metropolitan city flourish. When
tent-mercies are followed by temple-mercies, and these are attended by
national mercies, - the man, the worshipper, the patriot is trebly
favoured of the Lord. This favour is to be permanent throughout the good
man's life, and that life is to be a long one, for he is to see his
sons' sons. Many a time does true religion bring such blessings to men;
and when these good things are denied them, they have a greater reward
as a compensation.

[Psa 128:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#006)

"Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children." This is a great pleasure.
Men live their young lives over again in their grandchildren. Does not
Solomon say that "children's children are the crown of old men"? So they
are. The good man's glad that a pious stock is likely to be continued;
he rejoices in the belief that other homes as happy as his own will be
built up wherein altars to the glory of God shall smoke with the morning
and evening sacrifice. This promise implies long life, and that life
rendered happy by its being continued in our offspring. It is one token
of the immortality of man that he derives joy from extending his life in
the lives of his descendants.

"And peace upon Israel." With this sweet word [Psa
125:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#001) was closed. It is a favourite
formula. Let God's own heritage be at peace, and we are all glad of it.
We count it our own prosperity for the chosen of the Lord to find rest
and quiet. Jacob was sorely tossed about; his life knew little of peace;
but yet the Lord delivered him out of all his tribulations, and brought
him to a place of rest in Goshen for a while, and afterwards to sleep
with his fathers in the cave of Machpelah. His glorious Seed was
grievously afflicted and at last crucified; but he has risen to eternal
peace, and in his peace we dwell. Israel's spiritual descendants still
share his chequered conditions, but there remains a rest for them also,
and they shall have peace from the God of peace. Israel was a praying
petitioner in the days of his wrestling, but he became a prevailing
prince, and therein his soul found peace. Yes, all around it is true -
"Peace upon Israeli Peace upon Israel."
