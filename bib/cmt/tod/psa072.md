### [Psalms Chapter 72](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 72:0</span></span>

Title. - A Psalm for Solomon. - The best linguists affirm that this
should be rendered, of or by Solomon. There is not sufficient ground for
the rendering for. It is pretty certain that the title declares Solomon
to be the author of the Psalm, and yet from [Psa
72:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#020) it would seem that David uttered
it in prayer before he died. With some diffidence we suggest that the
spirit and matter of the Psalm are David's, but that he was too near his
end to pen the words, or cast them into form; Solomon, therefore, caught
his dying father's song, fashioned it into goodly verse, and, without
robbing his father, made the Psalm his own. It is, we conjecture, the
Prayer of David, but the Psalm of Solomon. Jesus is here, beyond all
doubt, in the glory of his reign, both as he now is, and as he shall be
revealed in the latter-day glory.

Division. - We shall follow the division suggested by Alexander. "A
glowing description of the reign of Messiah as righteous, [Psa
72:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001); universal, [Psa
72:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#008); beneficent, [Psa
72:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#012); and perpetual, [Psa
72:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#015); to which are added a
doxology, [Psa 72:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#018); and a
postscript, [Psa 72:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#020)."

Hints to Preachers

Whole Psalm. -

I. He shall.

II\. They shall. Ring the changes on these, as the Psalm does.

[Psa 72:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001). - The prayer of the ancient
church now fulfilled.

I. Our Lord's titles.

1\. King, by divine nature.

2\. King's Son, in both natures. Thus we see his power innate and
derived.

II\. Our Lord's authority: Judgments."

1\. To rule his people.

2\. To rule the world for his people's benefit.

3\. To judge mankind.

4\. To judge devils.

III\. Our Lord's character. He is righteous in rewarding and punishing,
righteous towards God and man.

IV\. Our loyal prayer. This asks for his rule over ourselves and the
universe.

[Psa 72:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#002). Christ's rule in his
church.

I. The subjects.

1\. Thy people, the elect, called, etc.

2\. Thy poor, through conviction and consciousness of sin.

II\. The ruler. He, only, truly, constantly, etc.

III\. The rule - righteous, impartial, gentle, prudent, etc. Lesson.
Desire this rule.

[Psa 72:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#003). - Mountains of divine
decree, of immutable truth, of almighty power, of eternal grace, etc.
These mountains of God are securities of peace.

[Psa 72:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#004). - The poor man's King, or
the benefits derived by the poor from the reign of Jesus.

[Psa 72:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#005). - The perpetuity of the
gospel, reasons for it, things which threaten it, and lessons derived
from it.

[Psa 72:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#006). - The field, the shower,
the result. This verse is easily enough handled in a variety of ways.

[Psa 72:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#007). -

I. The righteous flourish more at one season than another.

II\. They flourish most when Jesus is with them, "in his days," etc.

III\. The fruit of their growth is proportionally abundant, "and
abundance," etc. - G. Rogers.

[Psa 72:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#007). - "Abundance of peace."
Abundant overtures of peace, abundant redemption making peace, abundant
pardon conferring peace, abundant influences of the Spirit sealing
peace, abundant promises guaranteeing peace, abundant love spreading
peace, etc.

[Psa 72:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#008). - The universal spread of
the gospel. Other theories as to the future overturned, and their evil
influence exposed; while the benefit and certainty of this truth is
vindicated.

[Psa 72:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#009) (last clause). - The ignoble
end of Christ's enemies.

[Psa 72:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#010). - Christian finance;
voluntary but abundant are the gifts presented to Jesus.

[Psa 72:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#012). - Christ's peculiar care
of the poor.

martyr's blood.

I. Seen of God when shed.

II\. Remembered by him.

III\. Honoured by being a benefit to the church.

IV\. Rewarded especially in heaven.

[Psa 72:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#015). - "Prayer shall be made
for him." We are to pray for Jesus Christ. Owing to the interest he has
in certain objects, what is done for them is done for himself; and so he
esteems it. We, therefore, pray for him when we pray for his ministers,
his ordinances, his gospel, his church in a word, his cause. But what
should we pray for on his behalf?

I. The degree of its resources; that there be always a sufficiency of
suitable and able instruments to carry on the work.

II\. The freedom of its administration; that whatever opposes or hinders
its progress may be removed.

III\. The diffusion of its principles; that they may become general and
universal.

IV\. The increase of its glory, as well as its extent. - W. Jay.

[Psa 72:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#015). - Prayer for Jesus, a
suggestive topic. Daily praise, a Christian duty.

[Psa 72:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#015). - A living Saviour, a
giving people; the connection between the two. Or, Christ in the church
fills the exchequer, fosters the prayer-meeting, and sanctifies the
service of song.

[Psa 72:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#016). -

I. A happy description of the gospel; it is "a handful of corn."

II\. The places where it is sown.

[Psa 72:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#016). -

I. Commencement.

II\. Publicity.

III\. Growth.

IV\. Result.

[Psa 72:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#016). -

I. What? "Corn."

II\. How much? "A handful."

III\. Where? "In the earth upon the top of the mountains."

III\. Glorified in worlds to come, "endure,": "be continued," etc.

IV\. Glorified for ever. - G. Rogers.

[Psa 72:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#017), [Psa
72:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#018), [Psa
72:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#019). - The Four Blesseds, their

Here Endeth the Second Book of the Psalms

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Title

"For Solomon." I shall but mention a threefold analogy between Christ
and Solomon.

I. In his personal wisdom ([Kg1 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#029),
[Kg1 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#030)); so Christ ([Col
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#003)); "In him are hid all the
treasures of wisdom and knowledge."

II\. In the glorious peace and prosperity of his kingdom: the kingdom
was peacably settled in his hand. [Ch1
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#009); [Ch1
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#024), [Ch1
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#025). And so he fell to the work of
building the temple as Christ doth the church; so Christ ([Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006)); he is the Prince of Peace, the
great Peacemaker. [Eph 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014).

III\. In his marriage with Pharaoh's daughter. Some observe that the
daughter of Pharaoh never seduced him: neither is there any mention made
of the Egyptian idols. [Kg1 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#005), [Kg1
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#007). In his other outlandish
marriages he did sin; but this is mentioned as by way of special
exception ([Kg1 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#001)); for she was a
proselyte, and so it was no sin to marry her: and the love between her
and Solomon is made a type of the love between Christ and the church. So
Christ hath taken us Gentiles to be spouse unto him. Psalm 45. - Samuel
Mather (1626-1671), in "The Figures or Types of the Old Testament."

Whole Psalm

The Seventy-second Psalm contains a description of an exalted king, and
of the blessings of his reign. These blessings are of such a nature as
to prove that the subject of the Psalm must be a divine person. 1. His
kingdom is to be everlasting. 2. Universal. 3. It secures perfect peace
with God and goodwill among men. 4. All men are to be brought to submit
to him through love. 5. In him all the nations of the earth are to be
blessed; i.e., as we are distinctly taught in [Gal
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016), it is in him that all the
blessings of redemption are to come upon the world. The subject of this
Psalm is, therefore, the Redeemer of the world. - Charles Hedge, in
"Systematic Theology." - 1871.

Whole Psalm

This Psalm was penned by a king, it is dedicated to a king, and is
chiefly intended concerning him who is "King of kings." - Joseph Caryl,
in a Sermon entitled "David's Prayer for Solomon."

Whole Psalm

Two Psalms bear Solomon's name in their titles. One of these is the
Hundred and Twenty-seventh, the other is the Seventy-second; and here
the traces of his pen are unequivocal. A mistaken interpretation of the
note appended to it, "The prayers of David the Son of Jesse are ended,"
led most of the old commentators to attribute the Psalm to David, and to
suppose that it is a prayer offered in his old age "for Solomon," as the
peaceful prince who was to succeed him on the throne. However, it has
long been known that the note in question refers to the whole of the
preceding portion of the Psalter, much of which was written by Asaph and
the sons of Korah; and there can be no doubt that the title can only be
translated, "of Solomon." So clear are the traces of Solomon's pen that
Calvin, whose sagacity in this kind of criticism has never been
excelled, although he thought himself obliged, by the note at the end of
the Psalm to attribute the substance of it to David, felt Solomon's
touch so sensibly, that he threw out the conjecture that the prayer was
the father's, but that it was afterwards thrown into the lyrical form by
the son. This is not the place for detailed exposition; I will,
therefore, content myself with remarking that, properly speaking, the
Psalm is not "for Solomon" at all. If it refers to him and his peaceful
reign, it does so only in as far as they were types of the Person and
Kingdom of the Prince of Peace. The Psalm, from beginning to end, is not
only capable of being applied to Christ, but great part is incapable of
being fairly applied to any other. - William Binnie.

Whole Psalm

This is the fourth of those Psalms which predict the two natures of
Christ. This Psalm admonishes us that we believe in Christ as perfect
God, and perfect Man and King. - Psalter of Peter Lombard ( - 1164).

Whole Psalm

That under the type of Solomon (to whom it is inscribed) the Messiah is
"The King" of whom this Psalm treats, we have the consent, not only of
the most eminent divines of modern times, and of the Fathers of the
early Christian church, but of the ancient and most distinguished Jewish
expositors; of which reference, indeed, it contains the most conclusive
internal evidence. And, as under a new type, so is the kingdom here
presented to us in a new aspect, in marked contradistinction to its
character as foreshadowed by its other great type, the Davidical: for
the character Of David's reign was conquest. He was "a man of war" ([Ch1
28:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#001)); the appointed instrument for
subjecting the enemies of God's people Israel, by whom they Were put in
undisturbed possession of the promised land. But the character of
Solomon's reign was peace, the import of his name, Succeeding to the
throne after all enemies had been subdued, and governing the kingdom
which David's wars had established ([Kg1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#012)), the two types, respectively, Of
Christ as he is yet to be manifested at his next appearing; first
revealed as David, as seen in the vision of that event ([Rev
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011)): "I saw heaven opened, and
behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and
True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war," etc., subduing
the Antichristian confederacy (verses 19-21), as before predicted in,
the Second Psalm, of this same confederacy, "Thou shalt break them with
a rod of iron; thou Shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel."
And then, as Solomon, taking his throne, and extending the blessings of
his kingdom of peace to the ends of the earth. David in the Second
Psalm; Solomon in this. - William De Burgh.

Whole Psalm

The reader is reminded of James Montgomery's hymn, beginning, "Hail to
the Lord's Anointed;" it is a very beautiful versification of this
Psalm, and will be found in "Our Own Hymn Book," No. 353.

[Psa 72:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001)

"Give the king thy judgments, O God." Right and authority to execute
judgment and justice. The Father hath committed all judgment unto the
Son. - John Fry

[Psa 72:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001)

"The king"..."The King's son." I do not, apprehend, with the generality
of interpreters, that by "The king," and "The king's son" David means
himself and his son, but Solomon only, to whom both the titles agree, as
he was David's son, and anointed by him king during his lifetime. -
Samuel Chandler.

[Psa 72:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001)

"The king"..."The king's son." We see that our Lord is here termed both
מלך, and בּן־מלך being king himself, and also the son of a king; both as
respects his human origin, having come forth from the stock of David,
and also as to his divine origin; for the Father of the universe may, of
course, be properly denominated King. Agreeably to this designation, we
find on the Turkish coins the inscription: Sultan, son of Sultan. -
George Phillips.

[Psa 72:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#002)

"Thy judgments." From whom does he seek these? O God, he says, give
them. Therefore is it the gift of God that kings should Judge
righteously and observe justice. Moreover, he does not simply say, O
God, give judgments to the king, and righteousness to the king's son;
but thy judgments and thy righteousness. Grant them this grace, that
what is just in thy sight they may judge. The world has its own
judgments and its own righteousness, but deals in such a way that true
righteousness is more oppressed than approved. Not such are the
judgments and righteousness of God. - Musculus.

[Psa 72:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#003)

"The mountains shall bring peace to the people" etc. Those who apply
this Psalm to Solomon expound the distich thus; "That the steep
mountains on the frontier, strongly garrisoned, shall secure the land
from hostile invasion; and the hills, cleared of the banditti, which in
the rude ages were accustomed to inhabit them, under the government of
the king, intended in this Psalm, should be the peaceful seats of a
useful, civilised peasantry." This sense is not ill expressed in Mr.
Merrick's translation:

"Peace, from the fort-clad mountain's brow,

Descending, bless the plains below;

And justice from each rocky cell,

Shall violence and fraud expel."

But So little of the Psalm is at all applicable to Solomon, and the
greater part of it so exclusively belongs to the Messiah, that I think
these mountains and hills allude to the nature of the land of Judaea;
and the general sense is, that, in the times of the great king, the
inhabitants of that mountainous region shall live in a state of peace
and tranquillity. The thing intended is the happy condition of the
natural Israel, in the latter day restored to God's favour, and to the
peaceful possession of their own land. It is a great confirmation of
this sense, that "righteousness" is mentioned as the means of the peace
which shall be enjoyed. - Samuel Horsley.

[Psa 72:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#003)

"The mountains shall bring peace to the people." It was, and still is,
common in the East to announce good or bad news from the tops of
mountains and other eminences, By this means acts of justice were
speedily communicated to the remotest parts 'of the country. Thus, when
Solomon decided the controversy between the two harlots, the decision
was quickly known over all the land. See [Kg1
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#028). - Alexander Geddes.

[Psa 72:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#003)

"The mountains shall bring peace." The reference is to the fertility of
the soil; Which now is shown in an extraordinary way, when mountain
summits, Which are either oppressed with hopeless sterility or yield at
a far inferior rate to the valleys, produce all things plentifully. And
by this figure he signifies that this happiness of his kingdom shall not
be the portion of a few only, but shall abound in all places and to all
people, of every condition and of every age. No corner of the land, he
affirms shall be destitute of this fertility. - Mollerus.

[Psa 72:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#003)

"The mountains shall bring peace." You may be sure to have peace when
your mountains shall bring forth peace; when those mountains, which
heretofore were mountains of prey and hills of the robbers, shall be a
quiet habitation; when peace shall not be walled up in cities, or fenced
in by bulwarks, but the open fields and highways, the mountains and the
hills shall yield it abundantly; under every hedge, and under every
green tree, there shall you find it, 'when the cottagers and the
mountaineers shall have their fill of it; when they shall eat and be
satisfied, lie down and none shall make them afraid, then the blessing
is universal: and this is the work of righteousness. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 72:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#003)

The "mountains" and "hills" are not at all named as the most unfruitful
places of the land, which they really were not, in Palestine, compare
[Deu 33:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#015); [Psa
147:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#008), "Who maketh grass to grow upon
the mountains;" [Psa 65:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#012), - nor even
because what is on them can be seen everywhere, and from all sides
(Tholuck), compare against this, [Joe
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#018), "The mountains shall drop down
new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk," [Isa
55:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#012), - but, as being the most
prominent points and ornaments of the country, and, therefore, as
representing it, well fitted to express the thought that the country
shall be everywhere filled with peace. - E. W. Hengstenberg.

[Psa 72:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#004)

"The children of the needy." The phrase, the children of the afflicted,
is put for the afflicted, an idiom quite common in Hebrew; and a similar
form of expression is sometimes used by the Greeks, as when they say
υἱοὺς ἰατρων, the sons of physicians for physicians. - John Calvin.

[Psa 72:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#005)

The lofty glory of the Flavian family shall remain,

Enduring like the sun and stars.

Martial. - Bk. 9 Epig. 7.

[Psa 72:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#006)

"He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass," etc. This is spoken
and promised of Christ, and serves to teach us that Christ coming to his
church and people, by the gracious influences of his Holy Spirit, is
most useful and refreshing to their souls, like showers of rain to the
dry ground, or a meadow newly cut to make it spring again. Christless
souls are like the dry ground; without the moisture of saying grace
their hearts are hard; neither rods mercies nor sermons, make impression
upon them. Why? They are without Christ, the fountain of grace and
spiritual influences. Before the fall man's soul was like a well-watered
garden, beautiful, green, and fragrant; but by his apostasy from God, in
Adam our first head, the springs of grace and holiness are quite dried
up in his soul; and there is no curing of this drought but by the soul's
union with a new head; to wit, Christ our second Adam, who has the
Spirit given him without measure for the use of all his members. Now,
when we are united by faith to Christ, our Head of influences, the dry
land is turned into water-springs; Christ "comes down as the rain" by I,
is Spirit of regeneration, and brings the springs of grace into the
soul. He is the first and immediate receptacle of the Holy Spirit, and
all regenerating and sanctifying influences, and out of his fulness we
must by faith receive them. And when at any time the springs of grace
are interrupted in the soul by sin or unbelief, so as the ground turns
dry, the plants wither, and the things which remain are ready to die,
the soul hath need to look up to Jesus Christ to come down with new
showers upon the thirsty ground and decayed plants.

1\. As the rain is the free gift of God to the dry ground, it comes free
and cheap to poor and rich, small and great, and costs them nothing: so
Christ with his blessings is God's free gift to a dry and perishing
world; for which we should be continually thankful. 2. As nothing can
stop the falling of the rain; so nothing can hinder Christ's gracious
influences, when he designs to awake, convince, or soften a hard heart.
When those showers do fall on sinners, the most obstinate will must
yield, and cry, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? 3. As the rain is
most necessary and suitable to the dry ground, and to the various plants
it produceth, and also to the different parts of every plant or tree -
such as the root, trunk, branches, leaves, flowers, and fruit; so Christ
is absolutely necessary, and his influence most suitable to all his
people's souls, and to every faculty of them - the understanding, will,
memory, and affections; and to all their different graces, faith, love,
repentance, etc.; to root and establish them, strengthen and confirm
them, quicken and increase them, cherish and preserve them. 4. As the
rain comes in divers ways and manners to the earth, sometimes with cold
winds and tempests, thunders and lightnings, and at other times with
calmness and warmth; so Christ comes to sinners, sometimes with sharp
convictions and legal terrors, and sometimes with alluring invitations
and promises. 5. O how pleasant are the effects of rain to languishing
plants, to make them green and beautiful, lively and strong, fragrant
and beautiful! So the effects of Christ's influences are most desirable
to drooping souls, for enlightening and enlivening them, for confirming
and strengthening them, for comforting and enlarging them, for
appetising and satisfying them, transforming and beautifying them. A
shower from Christ would soon make the church, though withered, turn
green and beautiful, and to send forth a smell as of a field that the
Lord hath blessed; and likewise some drops of this shower, falling down
upon the languishing graces of communicants, would soon make them
vigorous and lively in showing forth their Saviour's death at his table.
- John Willison.

[Psa 72:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#006)

There cannot be a more lively image of a flourishing condition than what
is conveyed to us in these words. The grass which is forced by the heat
of the sun, before the ground is well prepared by rains, is weak and
languid, and of a faint complexion; but when clear shining succeeds the
gentle showers of spring, the field puts forth its best strength, and is
more beautifully arrayed than ever Solomon in all his glory. - Thomas
Sherlock. 1678-1761.

[Psa 72:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#006)

"He shall come down," ירד. There is a fourfold descending of Christ
which the Scripture mentions.

I. His incarnation, the manifestation of himself in the flesh.

II\. The abasing himself in condition; he did not only assume human
flesh, but all the natural infirmities of our flesh.

III\. The subjecting of himself to death.

IV\. The distillations of his grace and spiritual blessings upon his
church. - Ralph Robinson.

[Psa 72:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#006) (first clause)

Some render this "like dew on the fleece." The mysterious fleece of
Gideon, which, on being exposed to the air, is first of all filled with
the dew of heaven while all the ground around it is quite dry, and which
afterwards becomes dry while the earth is watered, pictures to us,
according to the old divines, that the dew of Heaven's grace was poured
out upon Judaea at the time when all the rest of the world remained in
barrenness and ignorance of God; but that now, by a strange alteration,
this same Judaea lies in dryness and forgetfulness of God, while, on the
contrary, all the other nations of the earth are inundated with the dew
of heavenly grace. - Pasquier Quesnel.

[Psa 72:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#006)

"Upon the mown grass." The Hebrew word used here hath a double
signification. It signifies a shorn fleece of wool, and it signifies a
meadow newly mown. This hath occasioned divers readings. Some read it,
He shall come down like the rain into a fleece of wool: so the
Septuagint. They that follow this reading make it an allusion unto the
dew that fell upon Gideon's fleece ([Jdg
6:37-39](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#037)), when all the land beside was
dry, and, again, upon the rest of the land when the fleece was dry.
Others read it according to our translation: "He shall come down like
rain upon the mown grass." This seems to me more agreeable to the
meaning of the Holy Ghost;' especially because of the clause following,
which is added by way of explication. "As showers that water the earth."
"As the showers," רביבים. Rain and showers differ only as less and more;
rain signifies smaller showers, and showers signify greater rain. [Deu
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#002). Rain falling in multitude of
drops is called a shower. "That water the earth." The word זרזיף,
zarziph, which is here translated "water," is only used in this place in
all the Bible. It signifies to water by dispersion, to water by drops.
The showers are dispersed in drops all over the face of the earth, in a
very regular and artificial way. "God hath divided," saith Job, "a
watercourse for the overflowings of water." [Job
38:25](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#025). The rain is from the cloud
spouted out by drops after such a manner that every part hath its share.
- Ralph Robinson.

[Psa 72:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#006)

"The mown grass;" literally, "that which is shorn," whether fleece or
meadow. In the former sense it occurs [Jdg
6:37](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#037), and so the older translators all
take it, (Aq. ἐπὶ κουράν, lxx and others ἐπὶ πλόκον Jerome and Vulgate,
in vellus,) probably with the idea that the reign of the monarch would
be accompanied by signal tokens of the divine favour and blessing, like
the dew upon Gideon's fleece; in the latter sense, the word is found
[Amo 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#001); and this is indisputably its
meaning here, as the parallel shows. The mown meadow is particularly
mentioned, because the roots of the grass would be most exposed to the
summer heat after the crop had been gathered in, and the effect would be
most striking in the shooting of the young green blade after the shower.
- J. J. Stewart Perowne.

[Psa 72:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#007)

"Righteous." "Peace" Do you ask what he is individually? The answer is,
"King of Righteousness": a being loving righteousness, working
righteousness, promoting righteousness, procuring righteousness,
imparting righteousness to those whom he saves, perfectly sinless, and
the enemy and abolisher of all sin. Do you ask what he is practically,
and in relation to the effect of his reign? The answer is, "King of
Peace:" a sovereign whose kingdom is a shelter for all who are
miserable, a covert for all who are persecuted, a resting-place for all
who are weary, a home for the destitute, and a refuge for the lost. -
Charles Stanford.

[Psa 72:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#007)

"Abundance of peace." Literally, "multitude of peace," that is, the
things which produce peace, or which indicate peace, will not be few,
but numerous; they will abound everywhere. They will be found in towns
and villages, and private dwellings; in the calm and just administration
of the affairs of the State; in abundant harvests; in intelligence, in
education and in undisturbable industry; in the protection extended to
the rights of all. - Albert Barnes.

[Psa 72:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#007)

"So long as the moon endureth." It does not necessarily follow from
these words that the moon will ever cease to exist. The idea, commonly
held, of the annihilation of the starry firmament is without foundation
in Scripture. Such an idea has a pernicious influence on the human mind,
inasmuch as it leads men to depreciate that which bears in such striking
character the stamp and impress of the divine glory. - Frederic Fysh.

[Psa 72:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#008)

"From the river." There are many modern interpreters who, from the
mention of the "river" - namely, the river Euphrates - in the other
clause of the verse, think that the boundaries of the land of Palestine
are here to be understood, that country being described as extending
from the Red Sea to the Sea of Syria, otherwise called the Sea of the
Philistines, and the Great Sea; and from the Euphrates to the Great
Desert lying behind Palestine and Egypt. These are the limits of the
Israelitish territory: the former, from the south to the west; the
latter, from the north to the east. ([Gen
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018).) But, in this passage, there
can Scarcely be a doubt that by the "river" - to wit, the Euphrates - is
indicated the extreme boundary of the earth towards the east. In a
highly poetical, magnificent description, such as is given in this song,
of a king exalted above all others, nothing can be conceived more
inappropriate than saying that the dominions of such a king should be
bounded by the limits of Palestine. - Ernest F. C. Rosenmller
(1768-1835), in "The Biblical Cabinet," vol. 32.

[Psa 72:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#009)

"They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him," etc. This is
equivalent to saying, the wild Arabs, that the greatest conquerors could
never tame, shall bow before him, or become his vassals; nay, his
enemies, and, consequently, these Arabs among the rest, "shall lick the
dust," or court him with the most abject submissions. - T. Harmer's
Observations.

[Psa 72:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#009)

"His enemies shall lick the dust." Bear in mind that it was a custom
with many nations that, when individuals approached their kings, they
kissed the earth, and prostrated their whole body before them. This was
the custom especially throughout Asia. No one was allowed to address the
Persian kings, unless he prostrated himself on the ground and kissed the
footsteps of the king, as Xenophon records. - Thomas Le Blanc.

[Psa 72:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#009), [Psa
72:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#010)

"Wilderness,... Tarshish," "Sheba." The most uncivilized, the most
distant, and most opulent nations shall pay their homage to him. -
Augustus F. Tholuck.

[Psa 72:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#009)

"They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies
shall lick the dust." They shall humble themselves under the mighty hand
of Christ; they shall acknowledge and receive him as their Lord; they
shall fear and reverence him as their King; they shall veil and bow to
his sceptre; they shall put themselves, and all that is theirs, under
Christ; they shall give themselves to the exaltation and setting up of
Christ. "The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents:
the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts." They shall consecrate
their abilities to Christ's service; they shall communicate of their
substance to the maintenance of Christ's church, and minister to the
preservation and increase of Christ's kingdom. "All kings shall fall
down before him: all nations shall serve him." All shall adore and serve
him as their king; all shall exalt and honour him, as loyal subjects,
their heavenly sovereign; all persons, from the highest to the lowest,
must serve the Lord Jesus, and study to make him glorious; grace works
obedience in the hearts of princes, as well as in the hearts of beggars.
The sun, as well as the stars, did obeisance unto Joseph in his vision;
kings, as well as inferior persons, do obeisance unto Christ, under his
kingdom and gospel. - Alexander Grosse ( - 1654), in "Sweet and
Soule-Perswading Inducements leading unto Christ," 1632.

[Psa 72:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#010)

"Tarshish" was an old, celebrated, opulent, cultivated, commercial city,
which carried on trade in the Mediterranean, and with the seaports of
Syria, especially Tyre and Joppa, and that it most probably lay on the
extreme west of that sea. Was there then, in ancient times, any city in
these parts which corresponded with these clearly ascertained facts?
There was. Such was Tartessus in Spain, said to have been a Phoenician
colony; a fact which of itself would account for its intimate connection
with Palestine and the Biblical narratives.

As to the exact spot where Tartessis (so written originally) lay,
authorities are not agreed, as the city had ceased to exist when
geography began to receive attention; but it was not far from the
Straits of Gibraltar, and near the mouth of the Guadalquivir,
consequently at no great distance from the famous Granada of later days.
The reader, however, must enlarge his notion beyond that of a mere city,
which, how great soever, would scarcely correspond with the ideas of
magnitude, affluence, and power, that the Scriptures suggest. The name,
which is of Phoenician origin, seems to denote the district of
south-western Spain, comprising the several colonies which Tyre planted
in that country, and so being equivalent to what we might designate
Phoenician Spain. We are not, however, convinced that the opposite coast
of Africa was not included, so that the word would denote to an
inhabitant of Palestine the extreme western parts of the world. - J. R.
Beard, in "A Cyclopaedia of Biblical Literature." 1866.

[Psa 72:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#010)

"The isles," איּים, only in the Psalter besides, [Psa
97:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#001), where, and uniformly, so
rendered. The word, however, denotes all habitable land as opposed to
water (see [Gen 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#005), where first it
occurs, with [Isa 42:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#015)), and so
"maritime land, whether the sea coast of continent or island"
(Gesenius); especially the countries washed by the Mediterranean, and
the remote coasts to the west of Palestine. So in the parallel prophecy,
[Isa 60:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#009), and [Isa
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011); [Isa
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#001), [Isa
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#002); [Isa
42:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#010); [Isa
49:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#001), etc. Accordingly, "The isles
shall wait for his law" ([Isa 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#004)) is
expounded in [Mat 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#022) - "In Him
shall the Gentiles trust." - William De Burgh

[Psa 72:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#010)

"Sheba and Seba." There appear to have been two nations living in the
same region, viz., Southern Arabia. One of these was descended from
Cush, the son of Ham, and the other from Joktan, a descendant of Shem.
These two peoples were often antagonistic in interests, despite the
similarity of their names, but their divisions would be healed, and
unitedly they would offer tribute to the Great King. It is an Arab
proverb, "divided as the Sabaeans," but Christ makes them one. "The
Greek geographers usually couple Abyssinia with Yemen, in Arabia, and
invariably represent the Abyssinians as an Arab or Sabaean race. Modern
travellers, also, unanimously agree in recognising the Arab type among
those Abyssinian populations which do not belong to the African stock."
That the Sabaean nations were wealthy is clear from the Greek historian
Agatharchides. "The Sabaeans," says he, "have in their houses an
incredible number of vases and utensils of all sorts, of gold and
silver, beds and tripods of silver, and all the furniture of astonishing
richness. Their buildings have porticoes with columns sheathed with
gold, or surmounted by capitals of silver. On the friezes, ornaments,
and the framework of the doors, they place plates of gold encrusted with
precious stones. They spend immense sums in adorning these edifices,
employing gold, silver, ivory, precious stones, and materials of the
greatest value." They appear, also, to have acquired great wealth by
trading, both with India and Africa, their peninsula lying between those
two regions. Rich would be their gifts if Lenormant and Chevallier's
description of their commerce be correct. "The principal importations
from India were gold, tin, precious stones, ivory, sandal-wood, spices,
pepper, cinnamon, and cotton. Besides these articles, the storehouses of
southern Arabia received the products of the opposite coast of Africa,
procured by the Sabaeans in the active coasting trade they carried on
with this not far distant land, where Mosyton (now Has Abourgabeh) was
the principal port. These were, besides the spices that gave name to
that coast, ebony, ostrich feathers, and more gold and ivory. With the
addition of the products of the soil of southern Arabia itself, incense,
myrrh, laudanum, precious stones, such as onyx and agates, lastly, aloes
from the island of Socotra, and pearls from the fisheries in the Gulf of
Ormus, we shall have the list of the articles comprised in the trade of
this country with Egypt, and with those Asiatic countries bordering on
the Mediterranean; and, at the same time, by considering this list, we
may form an idea of how great must have been the importance and activity
of such a traffic."

Poor as God's people usually are, the era will surely arrive when the
richest of the rich will count it all joy to lay their treasures at
Jesus' feet. - C. H. S.

[Psa 72:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#012)

"He shall deliver the needy when he crieth." There needeth no mediator
between him and his subjects: he heareth the needy when they cry. The
man that hath nothing within him or without him to commend him to
Christ, to assist, help, relieve, or comfort him in heaven or earth, is
not despised by Christ, but delivered from that which he feareth. -
David Dickson.

[Psa 72:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#013)

"He shall spare;" more correctly, compassionate or comfort the poor and
needy; and shall save the souls, or preserve the lives of the needy! -
William Henry Alexander, in "The Book of Praises: being the Book of
Psalms ... with Notes Original and Selected." 1867.

[Psa 72:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#013)

"And shall save the souls of the needy." Scipio used to say, that he
would rather save a single citizen than slay a thousand enemies. Of this
mind ought all princes to be towards their subjects; but this affection
and love rose to the highest excellence and power in the breast of
Christ. So ardent is his love for his own, that he suffers not one of
them to perish, but leads them to full salvation and, opposing himself
to both devils and tyrants who seek to destroy their souls, he
constrains their fury and confounds their rage. - Mollerus.

[Psa 72:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#014)

"And precious shall their blood be in his sight." The Angolani so
despised their slaves that they would sometimes give as many as
twenty-two for one hunting dog ... But Christ prefers the soul of one of
his servants to the whole world, since he died that it might be made
more capable of entering into eternal felicity. For breaking one goblet
the Roman cast his slave into the pond to be devoured by the muraenae.
But the Son of God came down from heaven to earth to deliver mankind,
his vile, ungrateful, faithless servants, from the pangs of the serpent,
like the golden fleece, and save them as Jonah from the whale. Is not
their blood precious in his sight? - Thomas Le Blanc.

[Psa 72:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#015)

"And he shall live;" Hebrew, "So shall he live;" i.e., the poor man. -
Charles Carter.

[Psa 72:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#015)

"And he shall live." There is a clear reference to the coronation of
kings in the loud acclamations, Long live the King! and the bestowal of
the customary gifts and presents, as is plain from [Sa2
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#016); [Kg1
1:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#039); [Sa1
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#027); [Ch2
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#005). - Hermann Venema.

[Psa 72:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#015)

"He shall live." Alexander the Great acknowledged at death that he Was a
frail and feeble man. "Lo! I," said he, "am dying, whom you falsely
called a god." But Christ proved that he was God when, by his own death,
he overcame, and, as I may say, slew death. - Thomas Le Blanc.

[Psa 72:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#015)

"He shall live." It is a great consolation to soldiers imperilled amid
many forms of death, that their king shall live. Whence one of the chief
of these warriors, consoling himself, said, "I know that my Redeemer
liveth, and that at the last day I shall rise from the earth." Great is
the consolation of the dying, that he for whom, or in whom, they die,
shall live for evermore. With whom, if we die, we shall also live again,
and share his riches equally with himself; for rich indeed is our
Solomon, in whom are hidden all the treasures of the wisdom and
knowledge of God. - Gerhohus.

[Psa 72:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#015)

"Prayer also shall be made for him continually; and daily shall he be
praised." it might have been rendered, "Prayer also shall be made
through him continually, and daily shall he be blessed." The word is
rendered "blessed," when speaking of an act of worship towards God; and
the word translated "for" is sometimes used for "through," as [Jos
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#015), - "Through the window." If we
hold the translation "for him," then it must be understood of the saints
praying for the Father's accomplishment of his promises, made to the Son
in the covenant of redemption, that his kingdom may come, his name be
glorified, and that he may see his seed, and that the full reward may be
given him for his sufferings, and so that he may receive the joy that
was set before him. - Jonathan Edwards.

[Psa 72:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#015)

"Prayer also shall be made for him continually; and daily shall he be
praised." In all conquered countries, two things marked the subjection
of the people: 1. Their money was stamped with the name of the
conqueror. 2. They were obliged to pray for him in their acts of public
worship. - Adam Clarke.

[Psa 72:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#016)

"An handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains." Not
only would the soil be likely to lack depth of earth, but the seed
itself would be apt to be blown away by the winds of heaven, or washed
down by the teeming rain to the base beneath. - Peter Grant. 1867.

[Psa 72:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#016)

"An handful of corn," etc. Upon mature consideration, I am persuaded
that the proper sense of the word פּו, or, פּסּה is "a patch" or
"piece;" and that it is used here just as we use the same words in
English, in such expressions as these, - "a patch of wheat, a patch of
barley, a piece of corn." - Samuel Horsley.

[Psa 72:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#016)

"An handful of corn." Doubtless it has been familiar to you to see corn
merchants carrying small bags with them, containing just a handful of
corn, which they exhibit as specimens of the store which they have for
sale. Now, let me beg of every one of you to carry a small bag with this
precious corn of the gospel. When you write a letter, drop in a word for
Christ; it may be a seed that will take root ... Speak a word for Christ
wherever you go; it may be seed productive of a great deal of fruit.
Drop a tract on the counter, or in a house; it may be a seed productive
of a plenteous harvest. The most difficult place, the steepest mountain,
the spot where there is the least hope of producing fruit, is to be the
first place of attack; and the more labour there is required, the more
is to be given, in the distribution of the seeds. - James Sherman.

[Psa 72:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#016)

"Shall shake like Lebanon." With a plentiful ear, shall yield so large
and strong a stalk that, with the motion of the wind, it shall shake
cedar-like. - Joseph Hall.

[Psa 72:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#016)

"Shall shake as Lebanon." That is to say, shall wave backwards and
forwards with the wind, like the tall cedars of Lebanon. This implies
that the corn will be lofty and luxuriant. - French and Skinner.

[Psa 72:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#016)

Neither wave nor shake conveys the full force of the Hebrew verb רעשׁ
which suggests the additional idea of a rushing noise, like that of the
wind among the cedars of Lebanon. This comparison is certainly more
natural and obvious than that which some interpreters assume with the
grain-crops or harvest-fields of Lebanon itself. This would be merely
likening one harvest to another, nor is any such allusion ever made
elsewhere to the mountain, though its circumjacent plains and valleys
were productive. - Joseph Addison Alexander.

[Psa 72:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#016)

"Like Lebanon." By dint of skill and labour, they have compelled a rocky
soil to become fertile. Sometimes, to avail themselves of the waters,
they have made a channel for them, by means of a thousand windings, on
the declivities, or have arrested them in the valleys by embankments. At
other times, they have propped up the earth, that was ready to roll
down, by means of terraces and walls. Almost all the mountains being
thus husbanded, present the appearance of a staircase, or of an
amphitheatre, each tier of which is a row of vines or mulberry-trees. I
have counted, upon one declivity, as many as a hundred, or a hundred and
twenty tiers from the bottom of the valley to the top of the hill. I
forgot, for the moment, that I was in Turkey. - Volney.

[Psa 72:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#016)

"Like Lebanon." To understand the images taken from Mount Lebanon, it is
necessary to remark that four enclosures of mountains are described,
rising one upon another. The first and lowest of these is described as
rich ingrain and fruits. The second is barren, being covered only with
thorns, rocks, and flints. The third, though higher still, is blessed
with a perpetual spring; the trees are always green. There are
innumerable orchards laden with fruit, and it forms, altogether, a
terrestrial paradise,

"Where fruits and blossoms blush,

In social sweetness, on the self, same bough."

The fourth, or highest ridge of all, is the region of perpetual snow.
Now, the imagery in the 72nd Psalm is evidently taken from the first of
these ridges of Lebanon, where (most probably following the ancient mode
of cultivating) the monks of Lebanon, for they were the chief
cultivators of the terraced soil, industriously husband every particle
of productive earth. In the expressive words of Burckhardt, "Every inch
of ground is cultivated," so that no image could have been more
singularly expressive of the universal cultivation under Messiah's
reign, than to say that "His fruit shall shake like Lebanon;" or,
understanding the Psalmist to speak figuratively, what moral landscape
could be painted more richly than he does, when he intimates that those
barren mountains of our world, which at present yield no fruit unto God,
shall be cultivated in that day so industriously and so fully, that the
fruit shall wave like the terraced corn-fields, or shake like the
hanging mulberry-trees on the terraced heights of Lebanon. - Robert
Murray McCheyne. 1813-1843.

[Psa 72:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#016)

"Shall flourish like grass." The peculiar characters of the grass, which
adapt it especially for the service of man, are its apparent humility
and cheerfulness. Its humility, in that it seems created only for lowest
service, - appointed to be trodden on and fed upon. Its cheerfulness, in
that it seems to exult under all kinds of violence and suffering. You
roll it, and it is stronger next day; you mow it, and it multiplies its
shoots, as if it were grateful; you tread upon it, and it only sends up
richer perfume. Spring comes, and it rejoices with all the earth, -
glowing with variegated flame of flowers, - waving in soft depth of
fruitful strength. Winter comes, and, though it will not mock its fellow
plants by growing then, it will not pine and mourn, and turn colourless
and leafless as they. It is always green; and is only the brighter and
gayer for the hoar-frost. - John Ruskin.

[Psa 72:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#017)

"His name shall be continued." Yinnon: The Kethiv, yanin, would be;
"shall produce fresh progeny," or "send forth new shoots."

M. Renan was far from intending to supply a commentary on this verse,
when he said of the Lord Jesus, "Son culte se rafeunira sans cesse." Yet
it would not be easy to find a more forcible illustration of the meaning
of yanin. - William Kay.

[Psa 72:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#017) (second clause)

The version and sense which Gussetius gives seems best of all: His name
shall generate, or beget children before the sun; that is, his name
preached, as the gospel, which is his name ([Act
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#015)), shall be the means of begetting
many sons and daughters openly and publicly, in the face of the sun, and
wherever that is. - John Gill.

[Psa 72:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#017)

"All nations shall call him blessed." It is sometimes inadvertently said
that the Old Testament is narrow and exclusive, while the New Testament
is broad and catholic in its spirit. This is a mistake. The Old and New
Testaments are of one mind on this matter. Many are called, and few
chosen. This is the common doctrine of the New as well as of the Old.
They are both equally catholic in proclaiming the gospel to all. The
covenant with Adam and with Noah is still valid, and sure to all who
return to God; and the call of Abram is expressly said to be a means of
extending blessing to all the families of man. The New Testament does
not aim at anything more than this: it merely hails the approaching
accomplishment of the same gracious end. - James G. Murphy, in "A
Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Book of Genesis?" 1863.

[Psa 72:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#019)

"Amen, and Amen." Rabbi Jehudah the Holy, said, "He that said Amen in
this world is worthy to say it in the world to come. David, therefore,
utters Amen twice in this Psalm, to show that one 'Amen' belongs to this
world, the other to that which is to come. He who saith 'Amen' devoutly
is greater than he who uttereth the prayers, for the prayers are but the
letter, and the Amen is the seal. The scribe writeth the letters, the
prince alone seals them." - Neale and Littledale.

[Psa 72:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#019)

"Amen, and Amen." What is "Amen" in [Mat
16:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#028) is axles, or "verily" in [Luk
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#027). Our Saviour hath this phrase
peculiar to himself, "Amen, Amen" to give confirmation to the doctrine,
and to raiser our attention and faith; or to show that not only truth is
spoken, but by him who is truth itself ... There is no need for a rubric
by the men of the Great Synagogue, or a canon, to command a man to
blush, when it is only the natural passion that will command it; so,
when the heart is warm in prayer with serious and earnest affections, a
double Amen doth as naturally flow from us as milk from a mother's
breast to her suckling. And Amen comes from אמן, aman, which signifies
"to nurse;" as if it were, if not the mother, yet the faithful nurse, of
lively devotion. Assent to repetitions is essential unto prayer, and it
is not signified publicly but by one Amen. - Thomas Woodcock ( - 1695)
in "Morning Exercises."

[Psa 72:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#019)

"Amen" is a short word, but marvellously pregnant, full of sense, full
of spirit. It is a word that seals all the truths of God, and seals
every particular promise of God. And It is never likely to arise in the
soul, unless there be first an almighty power from heaven, to seize On
the powers of the soul, to subdue them, and make it say, "Amen." There
is such an inward rising of the heart, and an innate rebellion against
the blessed truth of God, that unless God, by his strong arm, bring the
heart down, it never will nor can say, "Amen." - Richard Sibbes.

[Psa 72:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#020)

"The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended." This announcement
carries with it an intimation that other Psalms besides are to follow.
It would have been superfluous, if the Psalms had not been to follow
which bear on their front the name of David. To this, indeed, it must
point, bearing the character of an enigma, that these additional Psalms
stood in other relations than those given in the first two books. We
shall attain perfect clearness and certainty by perceiving that all the
Psalms of David in the last two books are inserted as component parts
into the later cycles. The subscription at the end of the second book
must have been designed to separate the free from the bound, the
scattered and serial Psalms of David from each other. Analogous in some
measure is the subscription, at an end are the speeches of Job, in [Job
31:40](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#040), which is not contradicted by
the fact that Job appears again speaking in chapters 40 and 42; it
should rather be regarded as serving to give us a right understanding of
that formal conclusion. - E. W. Hengstenberg.

[Psa 72:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#020)

At the conclusion of this Psalm, the Hebrew copies have, Here end the
orisons of David, the son of Jesse. But, as several other Psalms of
David follow, we must understand the note to mean either, "Here ends
this book of the orisons of David," or, "Here ends the Collection of
hymns made by David himself;" additions being afterwards made to it,
containing other hymns of David, by Asaph and others, and, lastly, by
Esdras. Daniel Cresswell.

[Psa 72:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#020)

"The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended." So long as the
fivefold division of the Psalter was neglected, this note gave nothing
but perplexity to the commentators. Augustine, and his master, Ambrose
of Milan, finding it standing in their Psalters, between the
seventy-second and seventy-third Psalms, took it for part of the title
of the latter, and tortured their ingenuity in divining its import.
Calvin saw that the note is retrospective, but, not having observed its
position at the end of a book, he thought it pertained exclusively to
the Psalm immediately preceding, and took it to mean that that Psalm
embalms the last prayers of the aged king. But he was at a loss to
reconcile this With the two obvious facts, that the title of the Psalm
ascribes it to Solomon, and that quite a different Psalm is elsewhere
preserved as "the last words of David" ([Sa2
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#001)) And this perplexity of the great
Reformer is shared by the older Commentators generally! We get rid of it
at once, by simply remarking the position of the note in question. It is
set down after a doxology which marks the end of the Second Book. It has
no special reference, therefore, to the seventy-second Psalm. It either
refers to the Second Book or, more probably, to both the First and
Second. - William Binnie.

[Psa 72:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#020)

"The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended." \[Compared with\] Ps.
86, title, "A prayer of David." How can the prayers of David be said to
be ended, when more begin? Answer: The end David had in making the
Psalm, and praises, is one thing; but to make a final end of praying is
another. Many opinions have been given to reconcile this. Some that here
end the prayers he made for Solomon. Some that here end the prayers he
made in the days of his affliction. Some that here end the praises that
he made, not the prayers, turning the word teptllahs into tehillahs.
Some that here end David's, the rest that follow are Asaph's. Some that
this Psalm was the last, the rest posthumes, found after his death. Some
think it is spoken as the phrase is in [Job
31:40](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#040) : "The words of Job are ended;"
and yet he had some words after this, but not so many. But the soundest
resolution is this: - Here ends the prayers of David the son Of Jesse;
that is, here they are perfected. If any ask hereafter what or where
lies the end that all these Psalms were made for? tell them here it lies
in this Psalm, and, therefore, placed in the midst of all; as the centre
in midst of a circle, all the lines meet here, and all the Psalms
determine here; for it is only a prophetical treatise of the kingdom of
Christ drawn out to the life, and it is dedicated to Solomon, because
here is Wisdom; other men had other ends, it may be, but the son of
Jesse had no other end in the worm but to set out Christ's kingdom in
making of his Psalms. - William Streat, in "The Dividing of the Hoof."
1654.

[Psa 72:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#020)

"The son of Jesse." It is the note of true humility and sincere love to
God to abase ourselves, and acknowledge our low condition, wherein God
did find us When he did let forth his love to us, that thereby we may
commend the riches of God's goodness and grace unto us, appeareth here
in David. - David Dickson.

[Psa 72:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#020)

"Are ended." The Sense is, that David, the son of Jesse, had nothing to
pray for, Or to wish, beyond the great things described in this Psalm.
Nothing can be more animated than this conclusion. Having described the
blessings of Messiah's reign, he closes the whole with his magnificent
doxology: -

Blessed be Jehovah God,

God of Israel, alone performing wonders;

And blessed be his name of glory,

And let his glory fill the whole of the earth.

Amen, and Amen.

Finished are the prayers of David, the son of Jesse.

Samuel Horsley.

[Psalms 72:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 72:1</span></span>

1 Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the
king's son.

2 He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with
judgment.

3 The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills,
by righteousness.

4 He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of
the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.

5 They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout
all generations.

6 He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers that
water the earth.

7 In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so
long as the moon endureth.

[Psa 72:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001)

"Give the king thy judgments, O God." The right to reign was transmitted
by descent from David to Solomon, but not by that means alone: Israel
was a theocracy, and the kings were but the viceroys of the greater
King; hence the prayer that the new king might be enthroned by divine
right, and then endowed with divine wisdom. Our glorious King in Zion
hath all judgment committed unto him. He rules in the name of God over
all lands. He is king "Dei Gratia" as well as by right of inheritance.
"And thy righteousness unto the king's son." Solomon was both king and
king's son; so also is our Lord. He has power and authority in himself,
and also royal dignity given him of his Father. He is the righteous
king; in a word, he is "the Lord our righteousness." We are waiting till
he shall be manifested among men as the ever-righteous Judge. May the
Lord hasten in his own time the long-looked-for day. Now wars and
fighting are even in Israel itself, but soon the dispensation will
change, and David, the type of Jesus warring with our enemies, shall be
displaced by Solomon the prince of peace.

[Psa 72:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#002)

"He shall judge thy people with righteousness." Clothed with divine
authority, he shall use it on the behalf of the favoured nation, for
whom he shall show himself strong, that they be not misjudged,
slandered, or in any way treated maliciously. His sentence shall put
their accusers to silence, and award the saints their true position as
the accepted of the Lord. What a consolation to feel that none can
suffer wrong in Christ's kingdom: he sits upon the great white throne,
unspotted by a single deed of injustice, or even mistake of judgment:
reputations are safe enough with him. "And thy poor with judgment." True
wisdom is manifest in all the decisions of Zion's King. We do not always
understand his doings, but they are always right. Partiality has been
too often shown to rich and great men, but the King of the last and best
of monarchies deals out even-handed justice, to the delight of the poor
and despised. Here we have the poor mentioned side by side with the
king. The sovereignty of God is a delightful theme to the poor in
spirit; they love to see the Lord exalted, and have no quarrel with him
for exercising the prerogatives of his crown. It is the fictitious
wealth which labours to conceal real poverty, which makes men cavil at
the reigning Lord, but a deep sense of spiritual need prepares the heart
loyally to worship the Redeemer King. On the other hand, the King has a
special delight in the humbled hearts of his contrite ones, and
exercises all his power and wisdom on their behalf, even as Joseph in
Egypt ruled for the welfare of his brethren.

[Psa 72:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#003)

"The mountains shall bring peace to the people." Thence, aforetime,
rushed the robber bands which infested the country; but now the forts
there erected are the guardians of the land, and the watchmen publish
far and near the tidings that no foe is to be seen. Where Jesus is there
is peace, lasting, deep, eternal. Even those things which were once our
dread, lose all terror when Jesus is owned as monarch of the heart:
death itself, that dark mountain, loses all its gloom. Trials and
afflictions, when the Lord is with us, bring us an increase rather than
a diminution of peace. "And the little hills, by righteousness." Seeing
that the rule of the monarch was just, every little hill seemed clothed
with peace. Injustice has made Palestine a desert; if the Turk and
Bedouin were gone, the land would smile again; for even ill the most
literal sense, justice is the fertilizer of lands, and men are diligent
to plough and raise harvests when they have the prospect of eating the
fruit of their labours. In a spiritual sense, peace is given to the
heart by the righteousness of Christ; and all the powers and passions of
the soul are filled with a holy calm, when the way of salvation, by a
divine righteousness, is revealed. Then do we go forth with joy, and are
led forth with peace; the mountains and the hills break forth before us
into singing.

[Psa 72:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#004)

"He shall judge the poor of the people." He will do them justice, yea,
and blessed be his name, more than justice, for he will delight to do
them good. "He shall save the children of the needy." Poor, helpless
things, they were packhorses for others, and paupers themselves, but
their King would be their protector. Happy are God's poor and needy
ones; they are safe under the wing of the Prince of Peace, for he win
save them from all their enemies. "And shall break in pieces the
oppressor." He is strong to smite the foes of his people. Oppressors
have been great breakers, but their time of retribution shall come, and
they shall be broken themselves. Sin, Satan, and all our enemies must be
crushed by the iron rod of King Jesus. We have, therefore, no cause to
fear: but abundant reason to sing -

"All hail the power of Jesus' name!

Let angels prostrate fall;

Bring forth the royal diadem,

And crown him Lord of all."

It is much better to be poor than to be an oppressor; for both the needy
and their children find an advocate in the heavenly Solomon, who aims
all his blows at haughty ones, and rests not till they are utterly
destroyed.

[Psa 72:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#005)

"They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure." And well they
may. Such righteousness wins the cheerful homage of the poor and the
godly, and strikes dismay into the souls of unrighteous oppressors; so
that all through the lands, both good and bad are filled with awe. Where
Jesus reigns in power men must render obeisance of some sort. His
kingdom, moreover, is no house of cards, or dynasty of days: it is as
lasting as the lights of heaven; days and nights will cease before he
abdicates his throne. Neither sun nor moon as yet manifest any failure
in their radiance, nor are there any signs of decrepitude in the kingdom
of Jesus; on the contrary, it is but in its youth, and is evidently the
coming power, the rising sun. Would to God that fresh rigour were
imparted to all its citizens to push at once the conquests of Immanuel
to the uttermost ends of the earth. "Throughout all generations" shall
the throne of the Redeemer stand. Humanity shall not wear out the
religion of the Incarnate God. No infidelity shall wither it away, nor
superstition smother it; it shall rise immortal from what seemed its
grave; as the true phoenix, it shall revive from its ashes! As long as
there are men on earth Christ shall have a throne among them. Instead of
the fathers shall be the children. Each generation shall have a
regeneration in its midst, let Pope and Devil do what they may. Even at
this hour we have before us the tokens of his eternal power; since he
ascended to his throne, eighteen hundred years ago, his dominion has not
been overturned, though the mightiest of empires have gone like visions
of the night. We see on the shore of time the wrecks of the Caesars, the
relics of the Moguls, and the last remnants of the Ottomans.
Charlemagne, Maximilian, Napoleon, how they flit like shadows before us!
They were and are not; but Jesus for ever is. As for the houses of
Hohenzollern, Guelph, or Hapsburg, they have their hour; but the Son of
David has all hours and ages as his own.

[Psa 72:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#006)

"He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass." Blessings upon his
gentle sway! Those great conquerors who have been the scourges of
mankind have fallen like the fiery hail of Sodom, transforming fruitful
lands into deserts' but he with mild, benignant influence softly
refreshes the weary and wounded among men, and makes them spring up into
newness of life. Pastures mown with the scythe, or shorn by the teeth of
cattle, present, as it were, so many bleeding stems of grass, but when
the rain falls it is balm to all these wounds, and it renews the verdure
and beauty of the field; fit image of the visits and benedictions of
"the consolation of Israel." My soul, how well it is for thee to be
brought low, and to be even as the meadows eaten bare and trodden down
by cattle, for then to thee shall the Lord have respect; he shall
remember thy misery, and with his own most precious love restore thee to
more than thy former glory. Welcome Jesus, thou true Bien-aimé, the
Well-beloved, thou art far more than Titus ever was - the Delight of
Mankind. "As showers that water the earth." Each crystal drop of rain
tells of heavenly mercy which forgets not the parched plains: Jesus is
all grace, all that he does is love, and his presence among men is joy.
We need to preach him more, for no shower can so refresh the nations.
Philosophic preaching mocks men as with a dust shower, but the gospel
meets the case of fallen humanity, and happiness flourishes beneath its
genial power. Come down, O Lord, upon my soul, and my heart shall
blossom with thy praise: -

"He shall come down as still and, light

As scatter'd drops on genial field;

And in his time who loves the right,

Freely shall bloom, sweet peace her harvest yield."

[Psa 72:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#007)

"In his days shall the righteous flourish." Beneath the deadly Upas of
unrighteous rule no honest principles can be developed, and good men can
scarcely live; but where truth and uprightness are on the throne, the
best of men prosper most. A righteous king is the patron and producer of
righteous subjects. None flourish under Nero but those who are monsters
like himself: like will to like; and under the gentle Jesus the godly
find a happy shelter. "And abundance of peace so long as the moon
endureth." Where Jesus reigns he is known as the true Melchizedek, king
both of righteousness and peace. Peace based upon right is sure to be
lasting, but no other will be. Many a so-called Holy Alliance has come
to the ground ere many moons have filled their horns, because craft
formed the league, perjury established it, and oppression was the design
of it; but when Jesus shall proclaim the great Truce of God, he will
ordain perpetual peace, and men shall learn war no more. The peace which
Jesus brings is not superficial or shortlived; it is abundant in its
depth and duration. Let all hearts and voices welcome the King of
nations; Jesus the Good, the Great, the Just, the Ever-blessed.

[Psalms 72:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 72:8</span></span>

8 He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river Unto
the ends of the earth.

9 They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his
enemies shall lick the dust.

10 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the
kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.

11 Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve
him.

[Psa 72:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#008)

"He shall have dominion also from sea to sea." Wide spread shall be the
rule of Messiah; only the Land's End shall end his territory: to the
Ultima Thule shall his sceptre be extended. From Pacific to Atlantic and
from Atlantic to Pacific, he shall be Lord, and the oceans which
surround each pole shall be beneath his sway. All other power shall be
subordinate to his; no rival nor antagonist shall he know. Men speak of
the Emperor of all the Russias, but Jesus shall be Ruler of all mankind.
"And from the river unto the ends of the earth." Start where you will,
by any river you choose, and Messiah's kingdom shall reach on to the
utmost bounds of the round world. As Solomon's realm embraced all the
land of promise, and left no unconquered margin; so shall the Son of
David rule all lands given him in the better covenant, and leave no
nation to pine beneath the tyranny of the prince of darkness. We are
encouraged by such a passage as this to look for the Saviour's universal
reign; whether before or after his personal advent we leave for the
discussion of others. In this Psalm, at least, we see a personal
monarch, and he is the central figure, the focus of all the glory; not
his servant, but himself do we see possessing the dominion and
dispensing the government. Personal pronouns referring to our great King
are constantly occurring in this Psalm; he has dominion, kings fall down
before him,: and serve him; for he delivers; he spares, he saves, he
lives, and daily is he praised.

[Psa 72:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#009)

"They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him." Unconquered by
arms, they shall be subdued by love. Wild and lawless as they have been,
they shall gladly wear his easy yoke; then shall their deserts be made
glad, yea, they shall rejoice and blossom as the rose. "And his enemies
shall lick the dust." If they will not be his friends, they shall be
utterly broken and humbled. Dust shall be the serpent's meat; the seed
of the serpent shall be filled therewith. Homage among Orientals is
often rendered in the most abject manner, and truly no sign is too
humiliating to denote the utter discomfiture and subjugation of
Messiah's foes. Tongues which rail at the Redeemer deserve to lick the
dust. Those who will not joyfully bow to such a prince richly merit to
be hurled down and laid prostrate; the dust is too good for them, since
they trampled on the blood of Christ.

[Psa 72:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#010)

"The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents." Trade
shall be made subservient to the purposes of mediatorial rule; merchant
princes, both far and near, shall joyfully contribute of their wealth to
his throne. Seafaring places are good centres from which to spread the
gospel; and seafaring men often make earnest heralds of the cross.
Tarshish of old was so far away, that to the eastern mind it was lost in
its remoteness, and seemed to be upon the verge of the universe; even so
far as imagination itself can travel, shall the Son of David rule;
across the blue sea shall his sceptre be stretched; the white cliffs of
Britain already Own him, the gems of the Southern Sea glitter for him,
even Iceland's heart is warm with his love, Madagascar leaps to receive
him; and if there be isles of the equatorial seas whose spices have as
yet not been presented to him, even there shall he receive a revenue of
glory. He has made many an islet to become a Holy Isle, and hence, a
true Formosa. "The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts."
Agriculture and pasturage shall contribute their share. Foreign princes
from inland regions, as yet unexplored, shall own the all-embracing
monarchy of the King of kings; they shall be prompt to pay their
reverential tribute religious offerings shall they bring, for their King
is their God. Then shall Arabia Felix be happy indeed, and the Fortunate
Isles be more than fortunate. Observe, that true religion leads to
generous giving; we are not taxed in Christ's dominions, but we are
delighted to offer freely to him. It will be a great day when kings will
do this: the poor widow has long ago been before them, it is time that
they followed; their subjects would be sure to imitate the royal
example. This free-will offering is all Christ and his church desire;
they want no forced levies and distraints, let all men give of their own
free will, kings as well as commoners; alas! the rule has been for kings
to give their subjects' property to the church, and a Wretched church
has received this robbery for a burnt offering; it shall not be thus
when Jesus more openly assumes the throne.

[Psa 72:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#011)

"Yea, all kings shall fall down before him." Personally shall they pay
their reverence, however mighty they may be. No matter how high their
state, how ancient their dynasty, or far-off their realms, they shall
willingly accept him as their Imperial Lord. "All nations shall serve
him." The people shall be as obedient as the governors. The extent of
the mediatorial rule is set forth by the two far-reaching alls, all
kings and all nations: we see not as yet all things put under him, but
since we see Jesus crowned with glory and honour in heaven, we are
altogether without doubt as to his universal monarchy on earth. It is
not to be imagined that an Alexander or a Caesar shall have wider sway
than the Son of God. "Every knee shall bow to him, and every tongue
shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the
Father." Hasten it, O Lord, in thine own time.

[Psalms 72:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 72:12</span></span>

12 For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him
that hath no helper.

13 He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the
needy.

14 He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious
shall their blood be in his sight.

[Psa 72:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#012)

"For he shall deliver the needy." Here is an excellent reason for man's
submission to the Lord Christ; it is not because they dread his
overwhelming power, but because they are won over by his just and
condescending rule. Who would not fear so good a Prince, who makes the
needy his peculiar care, and pledges himself to be their deliverer in
times of need? "When he crieth." He permits them to be so needy as to be
driven to cry bitterly for help, but then he hears them, and comes to
their aid. A child's cry touches a father's heart, and our King is the
Father of his people. If we can do no more than cry it will bring
omnipotence to our aid. A cry is the native language of a spiritually
needy soul; it has done with fine phrases and long orations, and it
takes to sobs and moans; and so, indeed, it grasps the most potent of
all weapons, for heaven always yields to such artillery. "The poor also,
and him that hath no helper." The proverb says, "God helps those that
help themselves;" but it is yet more true that Jesus helps those who
cannot help themselves, nor find help in others. All helpless ones are
under the especial care of Zion's compassionate King; let them hasten to
put themselves in fellowship with him. Let them look to him, for he is
looking for them.

[Psa 72:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#013)

"He shall spare the poor and needy." His pity shall be manifested to
them; he will not allow their trials to overwhelm them; his rod of
correction shall fall lightly; he will be sparing of his rebukes, and
not sparing in his consolations. "And shall save the souls of the
needy." His is the dominion of souls, a spiritual and not a worldly
empire; and the needy, that is to say, the consciously unworthy and
weak, shall find that he will give them his salvation. Jesus calls not
the righteous, but sinners to repentance. He does not attempt the
superfluous work of aiding proud Pharisees to air their vanity; but he
is careful of poor Publicans whose eyes dare not look up to heaven by
reason of their sense of sin. We ought to be anxious to be among these
needy ones whom the Great King so highly favours.

[Psa 72:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#014)

"He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence." These two things
are the weapons with which the poor are assailed: both law and no law
are employed to fleece them. The fox and the lion are combined against
Christ's lambs, but the Shepherd will defeat them, and rescue the
defenceless from their teeth. A soul hunted by the temptations of
Satanic craft, and the insinuations of diabolical malice, will do well
to fly to the throne of Jesus for shelter. "And precious shall their
blood be in his sight." He will not throw away his subjects in needless
wars as tyrants have done, but will take every means for preserving the
humblest of them. Conquerors have reckoned thousands of lives as small
items; they have reddened fields with gore, as if blood were water, and
flesh but manure for harvests; but Jesus, though he gave his own blood,
is very chary of the blood of his servants, and if they must die for him
as martyrs, he loves their memory, and counts their lives as his
precious things.

[Psalms 72:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 72:15</span></span>

15 And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba:
prayer also shall be made for him continually; and daily shall he be
praised.

16 There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the
mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and they of the
city shall flourish like grass of the earth.

17 His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long
as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him
blessed.

[Psa 72:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#015)

"And he shall live." Vive le Roi! O King! live for ever! He was slain,
but is risen and ever liveth. "And to him shall be given of the gold of
Sheba." These are coronation gifts of the richest kind, cheerfully
presented at his throne. How gladly would we give him all that we have
and are, and count the tribute far too small. We may rejoice that
Christ's cause will not stand still for want of funds; the silver and
the gold are his, and if they are not to be found at home, far-off lands
shall hasten to make up the deficit. Would to God we had more faith and
more generosity. "Prayer also shall be made for him continually." May
all blessings be upon his head; all his people desire that his cause may
prosper, therefore do they hourly cry, "Thy kingdom come." Prayer for
Jesus is a very sweet idea, and one which should be for evermore
lovingly carried out; for the church is Christ's body; and the truth is
his sceptre; therefore we pray for him when we plead for these: The
verse may, however, be read as "through him," for it is by Christ, as
our Mediator that prayer enters heaven and prevails. "Continue in prayer
is the standing precept of Messiah's reign, and it implies that the Lord
will continue to bless. "And daily shall he be praised." As he will
perpetually show himself to be worthy of honour, so shall he be
incessantly praised: -

"For him shall constant prayer be made,

And praises throng to crown his head;

His name, like sweet perfume, shall rise

With every morning's sacrifice."

[Psa 72:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#016)

"There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the
mountains." From small beginnings great results shall spring. A mere
handful in a place naturally ungenial shall produce a matchless harvest.
What a blessing that there is a handful; "except the Lord of hosts had
left unto us a very small remnant we should have been as Sodom, and we
should have been like unto Gomorrah;" but now the faithful are a living
seed; and shall multiply in the land. "The fruit thereof shall shake
like Lebanon." The harvest shall be so great that the wind shall rustle
through it, and sound like the cedars upon Lebanon: -

"Like Lebanon, by soft winds fann'd,

Rustles the golden harvest far and wide."

God's church is no mean thing; its beginnings are small, but its
increase is of the most astonishing kind. As Lebanon is conspicuous and
celebrated, so shall the church be. "And they of the city shall flourish
like grass of the earth." Another figure. Christ's subjects shall be as
plentiful as blades of grass, and shall as suddenly appear as eastern
verdure after a heavy shower. We need not fear for the cause of truth in
the land; it is in good hands, where the pleasure of the Lord is sure to
prosper. "Fear not, little flock, it is your Father's good pleasure to
give you the kingdom." When shall these words, which open up such a
vista of delight, be fulfilled in the midst of the earth?

[Psa 72:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#017)

"His name shall endure for ever." In its saving power, as the rallying
point of believers, and as renowned and glorified, his name shall remain
for ever the same. "His name shall be continued as long as the sun."
While time is measured out by days, Jesus shall be glorious among men.
"And men shall be blessed in him." There Shall be cause for all this
honour, for he shall really and truly be a benefactor to the race. He
himself shall be earth's greatest blessing; when men wish to bless
others they shall bless in his name. "All nations shall call him
blessed." The grateful nations shall echo his benedictions, and wish him
happy who has made them happy. Not only shall some glorify the Lord, but
all; no land shall remain in heathenism; all nations shall delight to do
him honour.

[Psalms 72:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 72:18</span></span>

18 Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous
things.

19 And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be
filled with his glory: Amen, and Amen.

20 The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.

[Psa 72:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#018), [Psa
72:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#019)

As Quesnel well observes, these verses explain themselves. They call
rather for profound gratitude, and emotion Of heart, than for an
exercise of the understanding; they are rather to be used for adoration
than for exposition. It is, and ever will be, the acme of our desires,
and the climax of our prayers, to behold Jesus exalted King of kings and
Lord of lords lie has done great wonders such as none rise can match,
leaving all others so far behind, that he remains the sole and only
wonder-worker; but equal marvels yet remain, for which we look with
joyful expectation. He is the Blessed God, and his name shall be
blessed; his name is glorious, and that glory shall fill the whole
earth. For so bright a consummation our heart yearns daily, and we cry
"Amen, and Amen."

[Psa 72:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#020)

"The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended." What more could he
ask? He has climbed the summit of the mount of God; he desires nothing
more. With this upon his lip, he is content to die. He strips himself of
his own royalty and becomes only the "son of Jesse," thrice happy to
subside into nothing before the crowned Messiah. Before his believing
eye the reign of Jesus, like the sun, filled all around with light, and
the holy soul of the man after! God's own heart exulted in it, and sung
his "Nunc dimittis:" "Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in
peace, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation!" We, too, will cease from
all petitioning if it be granted to us to see the day of the Lord. Our
blissful spirits will then have nothing further to do but for ever, to
praise the Lord our God.
