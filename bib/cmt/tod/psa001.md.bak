### [Psalms Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 1:0</span></span>

Title - This Psalm may be regarded as The Preface Psalm, having in it a
notification of the contents of the entire Book. It is the psalmist's
desire to teach us the way to blessedness, and to warn us of the sure
destruction of sinners. This then, is the matter of the [Psa
1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md), which may be looked upon, in
some respects, as the text upon which the whole of the Psalms make up a
divine sermon.

Division - This Psalm consists of two parts: in the first (from [Psa
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md) to the end of the [Psa
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003).md) David sets out wherein the
felicity and blessedness of a godly man consisteth, what his exercises
are, and what blessings he shall receive from the Lord. In the second
part (from [Psa 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#004) to the end.md) he
contrasts the state and character of the ungodly, reveals the future,
and describes, in telling language, his ultimate doom.

Hints to Preachers

[Psa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md) - May furnish an excellent
text upon "Progress in Sin," of "The Purity of the Christian," or "The
Blessedness of the Righteous." Upon the last subject speak of the
believer as blessed

1\. By God;

2\. In Christ;

3\. With all blessings;

4\. In all circumstances;

5\. Through time and eternity;

6\. To the highest degree.

[Psa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md) - Teaches a godly man to
beware,

\(1\) of the opinions,

\(2\) of the practical life, and

\(3\) of the company and association of sinful men.

Show how meditation upon the Word will assist us in keeping aloof from
these three evils.

The insinuating and progressive nature of sin. - J. Morison.

[Psa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md), in connection with the whole
Psalm. The wide difference between the righteous and the wicked.

[Psa 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#002.md) - The Word of God.

1\. The believer's delight in it.

2\. The believer's acquaintance with it.

We long to be in the company of those we love.

[Psa 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#002.md)

I. What is meant by "the law of the Lord."

II\. How it came there.

III\. What it yields,

IV\. How to be like it.

[Psa 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003.md) - "Planted by the rivers of
water."

pleasure, of pride, of unbelief, of profanity, of persecution, of
procrastinating, of self-deception, etc.; all these shall come to an
end.

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Whole Psalm

As the book of the Canticles is called the Song of Songs by a Hebraism,
it being the most excellent, so this Psalm may not unfitly be entitled,
the Psalm of Psalms, for it contains in it the very pith and
quintessence of Christianity. What Jerome saith on St. Paul's epistles,
the same may I say of this Psalm; it is short as to the composure, but
full of length and strength as to the matter. This Psalm carries
blessedness in the frontispiece; it begins where we all hope to end: it
may well be called a Christian's Guide, for it discovers the quick-sands
where the wicked sink down in perdition, and the firm ground on which
the saints tread to glory. - Thomas Watson's Saints' Spiritual Delight,
1660.

This whole Psalm offers itself to be drawn into these two opposite
propositions: a godly man is blessed, a wicked man is miserable; which
seem to stud as two challenges, made by the prophet: one, that he will
maintain a godly man against all comers, to be the only Jason for
winning the golden fleece of blessedness; the other, that albeit the
ungodly make a show in the world of being happy, yet they of all men are
most miserable. - Sir Richard Baker, 1640.

I have been induced to embrace the opinion of some among the ancient
interpreters (Augustine, Jerome, etc.), who conceive that the [Psa
1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)is intended to be descriptive of
the character and reward of the Just One, i.e the Lord Jesus. - John
Fry, B.A., 1842.

[Psa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

The psalmist saith more to the point about true happiness in this short
Psalm than any one of the philosophers; or all of them put together;
they did but beat the bush, God hath here put the bird into our hand. -
John Trapp, 1660.

[Psa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

Where the word blessed is hung out as a sign, we may be sure that we
shall find a godly man within. - Sir Richard Baker

[Psa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

The seat of the drunkard is the seat of the scornful. - Matthew Henry,
1662-1714.

[Psa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

"Walketh not... nor standeth... nor sitteth," etc. Negative precepts are
in some cases more absolute and peremptory than affirmatives; for to
say," that hath walked in the counsel of the godly," might not be
sufficient; for, he might walk in the counsel of the godly, and yet walk
in the counsel of the ungodly too; not both indeed at once, but both at
several times; where now, this negative clears him at all times. - Sir
Richard Baker.

[Psa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

The wordתאשׁ haish is emphatic, that man; that one among a thousand who
lives for the accomplishment of the end for which God created him. -
Adam Clarke, 1844.

[Psa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

"That walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly." Mark certain
circumstances of their differing characters and conduct. I. The ungodly
man has his counsel. II. The sinner has his way; and III. The scorner
has his seat. The ungodly man is unconcerned about religion; he is
neither zealous for his own salvation nor for that of others; and he
counsels and advises those with whom he converses to adopt his plan, and
not trouble themselves about praying, reading, repentance, etc., etc.;
"there: is no need for such things; live an honest life, make no fuss
about religion, and you will fare well enough at last." Now, "blessed is
the man who walks not in this man's counsel," who does not come into his
measures, nor act according to his plan.

The sinner has his particular way of transgressing; one is a drunkard,
another dishonest, another unclean. Few are given to every species of
vice. There are many covetous men who abhor drunkenness, many drunkards
who abhor covetousness and so of others. Each has his easily besetting
sin; therefore, says the prophet, "Let the wicked forsake his way." Now,
blessed is he who stands not in such a man's way.

The scorner has brought, in reference to himself, all religion and moral
feeling to an end. He has sat down - is utterly confirmed in impiety,
and makes a mock at sin. His conscience is seared, and he is a believer
in all unbelief. Now, blessed is the man who sits not down in his seat.
- Adam Clark.

[Psa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

In the Hebrew, the word "blessed" is a plural noun, ashrey
(blessednesses), that is, all blessednesses are the portion of that man
who has not gone away, etc.; as though it were said, "All things are
well with that man who," etc,: Why do you hold any dispute? Why draw
vain conclusions? If a man had found that pearl of great price, to love
the law of God and to be separate from the ungodly, all blessednesses
belong to that man; but, if he does not find this jewel, he will seek
for all blessednesses but will never find one! For as all things are
pure unto the pure, so all things are lovely unto the loving, all things
good unto the good; and, universally, such as thou art thyself, such is
God himself unto thee, though he is not a creature. He is perverse unto
the perverse; and holy unto the holy. Hence nothing can be good or
saving unto him who is evil; nothing sweet unto him unto whom the law of
God-is not sweet. The word "counsel" is without doubt here to be
received as signifying decrees and doctrines, seeing that no society of
men exists without being formed and preserved by decrees and laws.
David, however, by this term strikes at the pride and reprobate temerity
of the ungodly. First, because they will not humble themselves so far as
to walk in the law of the Lord, but rule themselves by their own
counsel. And then he calls it their "counsel," because it is their
prudence, and the way that seems to them to be without-error. For this
is the destruction of the ungodly - their being prudent in their own
eyes and in their own esteem, and clothing their errors in the garb of
prudence and of the right way. For if they came to men in the open garb
of error, it would not be so distinguishing a mark of blessedness not to
walk with them. But David does not here say, "in the folly of the
ungodly," or "in the error of the ungodly;" and therefore he admonishes
us-to guard with all diligence against the appearance of what is right,
that the devil transformed into an angel of light do not seduce us by
his craftiness. And he contrasts the counsel of the wicked with the law
of the Lord, that we may learn to beware of wolves: in sheep's clothing,
who are always ready to give counsel to all, to teach all, and to offer
assistance unto all, when they are of all men the least qualified to do
so. The term "stood" descriptively represents their obstinacy, and
stiff-neckedness, wherein they harden themselves and make their excuses
in words of malice, having become incorrigible, in their ungodliness.
For "to stand," in the figurative manner of Scripture expression,
signifies to be firm and fixed: as in [Rom
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#004.md), "To his own master he standeth
or falleth: yea, he shall be holden up, for God is able to make him
stand." Hence the word "column" is by the Hebrew derived from their verb
"to stand," as is the word statue among the Latins. For this is the very
self-excuse and self-hardening of the ungodly - their appearing to
themselves to live rightly, and to shine in the eternal show of works
above all others. With respect to the term "seat," to sit in the seat,
is to teach, to act the instructor and teacher; as, in [Mat
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#002.md), "The scribes sit in Moses'
chair." They sit in the seat of pestilence, who fill the church with the
opinions of philosophers, with the traditions of men, and with the
counsels of their own brain, and oppress miserable consciences,-setting
aside, all the while the word of God, by which alone the soul is fed,
lives, and is preserved. - Martin Luther, 1536-1546.

[Psa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

"The scornful." Peccator cure in profundum venerit contemnet - when a
wicked man comes to the depth and worst of sin, he despiseth. Then the
Hebrew will despise Moses ([Exo 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#014).md),
"Who made thee a prince and a judge over us?" Then Ahab will quarrel
with Micaiah ([Kg1 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#018).md), because he
doth not prophesy good unto him. Every child in Bethel will mock Elisha
([Kg2 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#023).md), and be bold to call him
"bald pate." Here is an original drop of venom swollen to a main ocean
of poison: as one drop of some serpents' poison, lighting on the hand,
gets into the veins, and so spreads itself over all the body till it
hath stifled the vital spirits. God shall "laugh you to scorn," ([Psa
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#004).md), for laughing him to scorn; and
at last despise you that have despised him in us. That which a man spits
against heaven, shall fall back on his own face. Your indignities done
to your spiritual physicians shall sleep in the dust with your ashes,
but stand up against your souls in judgment. - Thomas Adams, 1614.

[Psa 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#002.md)

"But his will is in the law of the, Lord." The "will," which is here
signified, is that delight of heart, and that certain, pleasure, in the
law, which does not look at what the law promises, nor at what it
threatens, but at this only; that "the law is holy, and just, and good."
Hence it is not only a love of the law, but that loving delight in the
law which no prosperity, nor adversity, nor the world, nor the prince of
it, can either take away or destroy; for it victoriously bursts its way
through poverty, evil report, the cross, death, and hell, and in the
midst of adversities, shines the brightest. - Martin Luther.

[Psa 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#002.md)

"His delight is in the law of the Lord." - This delight which the
prophet here speaks of is the only delight that neither blushes nor
looks pale; the only delight that gives a repast without an after
reckoning; the only delight that stands in construction with all tenses;
and like neas Anchyses, carries his parents upon his back. - Sir Richard
Baker.

[Psa 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#002.md)

"In his law doth he meditate." In the plainest text there is a world of
holiness and spirituality; and if we in prayer and dependence upon God
did sit down and study it, we should behold much more than appears to
us. It may be, at once reading or looking, we see little or nothing; as
Elijah's servant went once, and saw nothing; therefore he was commanded
to look seven times. What now? says the prophet, "I see a cloud rising,
like a man's hand;" and by-and by, the whole surface of the heavens was
covered with clouds. So you may look lightly upon a Scripture and see
nothing; meditate often upon it, and there you shall see a light, like
the light of the sun." - Joseph Caryl, 1647.

[Psa 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#002.md)

"In his law doth he meditate day and night." - The good man doth
meditate on the law of God day and night. The pontificians beat off the
common people from this common treasury, by objecting this supposed
difficulty. Oh, the Scriptures are hard to be understood, do not you
trouble your heads about them; we will tell you the meaning of them.
They might as well say, heaven is a blessed place, but it is a hard way
to it; do not trouble yourselves we will go thither for you. Thus in the
great day of trial, when they should be saved by their book, alas! they
have no book to save them. Instead of the Scriptures they can present
images; these are the laymen's books; as if they were to be tried by a
jury of carvers and painters, and not by the twelve apostles. Be not you
so cheated; but study the gospel as you look for comfort by the gospel.
He that hopes for the inheritance, will make much of the conveyance. -
Thomas Adams.

[Psa 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#002.md)

To "meditate," as it is generally understood, signifies to discuss, to
dispute; and its meaning is always confined to a being employed in
words, as in [Psa 37:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#030.md), "The mouth of
the righteous shall meditate wisdom." Hence Augustine has, in his
translation, "chatter"; and a beautiful metaphor it is - as chattering
is the employment of birds, so a continual" conversing in the law of the
Lord (for talking is peculiar to man), ought to be the employment of
man, But I cannot worthily and fully set forth the gracious meaning and
force of this word; for this "meditating" consists first in an intent
observing of the words of the law, and then in a comparing of the
different Scriptures; which is a certain delightful hunting, nay, rather
a playing with stags in a forest, where the Lord furnishes us with the
stags, and opens to us their secret coverts. And from this kind of
employment, there comes forth at length a man well instructed in the law
of the Lord to speak unto the people. - Martin Luther.

[Psa 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#002.md)

"In his law doth he meditate day and night." The godly man will read the
Word by day, that men, seeing his good works, may glorify his Father who
is in heaven; he will do it in the night, that he may not be seen of
men: by day, to show that he is not one of those who dread the light; by
night, to show that he is one who can shine in the shade: by day, for
that is the time for working - work whilst it is day; by night, lest his
Master should come as a thief, and find him idle. - Sir Richard Baker.

[Psa 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#002.md)

I have no rest, but in a nook, with the book. - Thomas Kempis, 1380-1471

[Psa 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#002.md)

"Meditate." Meditation doth discriminate and characterise a man; by this
he may take a measure of his heart, whether it be good or bad; let me
allude to that; "For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he." [Pro
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#007.md). As the meditation is, such is
the man. Meditation is the touchstone of a Christian; it shows what
metal he is made of. It is a spiritual index; the index shows what is in
the book, so meditation shows what is in the heart. - Thomas Watson's
Saints' Spiritual Delight.

Meditation chews the cud, and gets the sweetness and nutritive virtue of
the Word into the heart and life: this is the way the godly bring forth
much fruit. - Bartholomew Ashwood's Heavenly Trade, 1688.

The naturalists observe that to uphold and accommodate bodily life,
there are divers sorts of faculties communicated, and these among the
rest: 1. An attractive faculty, to assume and draw in the food; 2. A
retentive faculty, to retain it when taken in; 3. An assimilating
faculty, to concoct the nourishment; 4. An augmenting faculty, for
drawing to perfection. Meditation is all these. It helps judgment,
wisdom, and faith to ponder, discern, and credit the things which
reading and hearing supply and furnish. It assists the memory to lock up
the jewels of divine truth in her sure treasury. It has a digesting
power, and turns special truth into spiritual nourishment; and lastly,
it helps the renewed heart to grow upward and increase its power to know
the things which are freely given to us of God. - Condensed from
Nathaniel Ranew, 1670.

[Psa 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003.md)

"A tree." - There is one tree, only to be found in the valley of the
Jordan, but too beautiful to be entirely passed over; the oleander, with
its bright blossoms and dark green leaves, giving the aspect of a rich
garden to any spot where it grows. It is rarely if ever alluded to in
the Scriptures: But it may be the tree planted by the streams of water
which bringeth forth his fruit in due Season, and "whose leaf shall not
wither." - A. P. Stanley, D. D., in "Sinai and Palestine."

[Psa 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003.md)

"A tree planted by the rivers of water." - This is an allusion to the
Eastern method of cultivation, by which rivulets of water are made to
flow between the rows of trees, and thus, by artificial means, the trees
receive a constant supply of moisture.

[Psa 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003.md)

"His fruit in his season." - In such a case expectation is never
disappointed. Fruit is expected, fruit is borne, and it comes also in
the time in which it should come. A godly education, under the
influences of the divine Spirit, which can never be withheld where they
are earnestly sought, is sure to produce the fruits of righteousness;
and he who reads, prays, and meditates, will ever see the work which God
has given him to do; the power by which he is to perform it; and the
times, places, and opportunities for doing those things by which God can
obtain most glory, his own soul most good, and his neighbour most
edification. - Adam Clarke.

[Psa 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003.md)

"In his season." The Lord reckons the times which pass over us, and puts
them to our account: let us, therefore, improve them, and, with the
impotent persons at the pool of Bethesda, step in when the angel stirs
the water. Now the church is afflicted, it is a season of prayer and
learning; now the church is enlarged, it is a season of praise; I am now
at a sermon, I will hear what God will say; now in the company of a
learned and wise man, I will draw some knowledge and counsel from him; I
am under a temptation, now is a fit time to lean on the name of the
Lord; I am in a place of dignity and power, let me consider what it is
that God requireth of me in such a time as this. And thus as the tree of
life bringeth fruit every month, so a wise Christian, as a wise
husbandman, hath his distinct employments for every month, bringing
forth his fruit in his season. - John Spencer's Things New and Old,
1658.

[Psa 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003.md)

"In his season." Oh, golden and admirable word! by which is asserted the
liberty of Christian righteousness. The ungodly have their stated days,
stated times, certain works, and certain places; to which they stick so
closely, that if their neighbours were perishing with hunger, they could
not be torn from them. But this blessed man, being free at all times, in
all places, for every work, and to every person, will serve you whenever
an opportunity is offered him; whatsoever comes into his hands to do, he
does it. He is neither a Jew, nor a Gentile, nor a Greek, nor a
barbarian, nor of any other particular person lie gives his fruit in his
season, so often as either God or man requires his work. Therefore his
fruits have no name, and his times have no name. - Martin Luther.

[Psa 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003.md)

"His leaf also shall not wither." He describes the fruit before he does
the leaf. The Holy Spirit himself always teaches every faithful preacher
in the church to know that the kingdom of God does not stand in word but
in power. [Co1 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#020.md). Again, "Jesus
began both to do and to teach." [Act
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001.md). And again, "Which was a prophet
mighty in deed and word." [Luk 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#019.md).
And thus, let him who professes the word of doctrine, first put forth
the fruits of life, if he would not have his fruit to wither, for Christ
cursed the fig tree which bore no fruit. And as Gregory saith, that man
whose life is despised is condemned by his doctrine, for he preaches to
others, and is himself reprobated. - Martin Lather.

[Psa 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003.md)

"His leaf also shall not wither." The Lord's trees are all evergreens.
No winter's cold can destroy their verdure; and yet, unlike evergreens
in our country, they are all fruit bearers. - C. H. S.

[Psa 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003.md)

"And whatsoever he doeth, \[or, maketh or taketh in hand\] shall
prosper." And with regard to this "prospering," take heed that thou
understandest not a carnal prosperity. This prosperity is hidden
prosperity, and lies entirely secret in spirit; and therefore if thou
hast not this prosperity that is by faith, thou shouldst rather judge
thy prosperity to be the greatest adversity. For as the devil bitterly
hates this leaf and the word of God, so does he also those who teach and
hear it, and he persecutes such, aided by all the powers of the world.
Therefore thou hearest of a miracle the greatest of all miracles, when
thou hearest that all things prosper which a blessed man doeth. - Martin
Luther.

[Psa 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003.md)

A critical journal has shown that instead of "Whatsoever it doeth shall
prosper," the rendering might be, "Whatsoever it produceth shall come to
maturity." This makes the figure entire, and is sanctioned by some MSS
and ancient versions.

[Psa 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003) (last clause.md)

Outward prosperity, if it follow close walking with God, is very sweet;
as the cipher, when it follows a figure, adds to the number, though it
be nothing in itself. - John Trapp.

[Psa 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#004.md)

"Chaff." Here by the way, we may let the wicked know they have a thanks
to give they little think of; that they may thank the godly for all the
good days they live upon the earth, seeing it is for their sakes and not
for their own that they enjoy them, For as the chaff while it is united
and keeps close to the wheat, enjoys some privileges for the wheat's
sake, and is laid up carefully in the barn; but as soon as it is
divided, and parted from the wheat, it is cast out and scattered by the
wind; so the wicked, whilst the godly are in company and live amongst
them, partake for their sake of some blessedness promised to the godly;
but if the godly forsake them or be taken from them, then either a
deluge of water comes suddenly upon them, as it did upon the old world
when Noah left it; or a deluge of fire as it did upon Sodom, when Lot
left it and went out of the city. - Sir Richard Baker.

[Psa 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#004.md)

"Driveth away," or tosseth away; the Chaldee translateth for "wind,"
"whirlwind." - Henry Ainsworth, 1639.

This shows the vehement tempest of death, which sweeps away the soul of
the ungodly.

[Psa 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#005.md)

"Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment," etc. And may
not a reason also be conceived thus, why the ungodly can never come to
be of the congregation of the righteous: the righteous go a way that God
knows, and the wicked go a way that God destroys; and seeing that these
ways can never meet, how should the, men meet that go these ways? And to
make sure work that they shall never meet indeed, the prophet expresseth
the way of the righteous by the first link of the chain of God's
goodness, which is his knowledge; but expresseth the way of the wicked
by the last link of God's justice, which is his destroying; and though
God's justice and his mercy do often meet, and are contiguous one to
another, yet the first link of his mercy and the last link of his
justice can never meet, for it never comes to destroying till God be
heard to say Nescio vos, "I know you not," and nescio vos in God, and
God's knowledge, can certainly never possibly meet together. - Sir
Richard Baker.

The Irish air will sooner brook a toad, or a snake, than heaven a
sinner. - John Trapp.

[Psa 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#006.md)

"For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the
ungodly shall perish." Behold how David here terrifies us away from all
prosperous appearances, and commends to us various temptations and
adversities. For this "way" of the righteous all men utterly reprobate;
thinking also, that God knoweth nothing about any such way. But this is
the wisdom of the cross. Therefore, it is God alone that knoweth the way
of the righteous, so hidden is to it the righteous themselves. For his
right hand leads them on in a wonderful manner, seeing that it is a way,
not of sense, nor of reason, but of faith only; even of that faith that
sees in darkness, and beholds things that are invisible. - Martin
Lather.

"The righteous." They that endeavour righteous living in themselves and
have Christ's righteousness imputed to them. - Thomas Wilcocks, 1586.

[Psalms 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 1:1</span></span>

1 Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor
standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.

2 But his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he
meditate day and night.

"Blessed" - see how this Book of Psalms opens with a benediction, even
as did the famous Sermon of our Lord upon the Mount! The word translated
"blessed" is a very expressive one. The original word is plural, and it
is a controverted matter whether it is an adjective or a substantive.
Hence we may learn the multiplicity of the blessings which shall rest
upon the man whom God hath justified, and the perfection and greatness
of the blessedness he shall enjoy. We might read it, "Oh, the
blessedness!" and we may well regard it (as Ainsworth does)as a joyful
acclamation of the gracious man's felicity. May the like benediction
rest on us!

Here the gracious man is described both negatively ([Psa
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001).md) and positively ([Psa
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#002).md); He is a man who does not walk in
the counsel of the ungodly. He takes wiser counsel, and walks in the
commandments of the Lord his God. To him the ways of piety are paths of
peace and pleasantness. His footsteps are ordered by the Word of God,
and not by the cunning and wicked devices of carnal men. It is a rich
sign of inward grace when the outward walk is changed, and when
ungodliness is put far from our actions. Note next, he standeth not in
the way of sinners. His company is of a choicer sort than it was.
Although a sinner himself, he is now a blood-washed sinner, quickened by
the Holy Spirit, and renewed in heart. Standing by the rich grace of God
in the congregation of the righteous, he dares not herd with the
multitude that do evil. Again it is said, "nor sitteth in the seat of
the scornful." He finds no rest in the atheist's scoffings. Let others
make a mock of sin, of eternity, of hell and heaven, and of the Eternal
God; this man has learned better philosophy than that of the infidel,
and has too much sense of God's presence to endure to hear his name
blasphemed, The seat of the scorner may be very lofty, but it is very
near to the gate of hell; let us flee from it, for it shall soon be
empty, and destruction shall swallow up the man who sits therein. Mark
the gradation in the first verse:

He walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, Nor standeth in the way of
sinners. Nor sitteth in the seat of scornful. When men are living in sin
they go from bad to worse. At first they merely walk in the counsel of
the careless and ungodly, who forget God - the evil is rather practical
than habitual - but after that, they become habituated to evil, and they
stand in the way of open sinners who wilfully violate God's
commandments; and if let alone, they go one step further, and become
themselves pestilent teachers and tempters of others, and thus they sit
in the seat of the scornful. They have taken their degree in vice, and
as true Doctors of Damnation they are installed, and are looked up to by
others as Masters in Belial. But the blessed man, the man to whom all
the blessings of God belong, can hold no communion with such characters
as these. He keeps himself pure from these lepers; he puts away evil
things from him as garments spotted by the flesh; he comes out from
among the wicked, and goes without the camp, bearing the reproach of
Christ. O for grace to be thus separate from sinners.

And now mark his positive character. "His delight is in the law of the
Lord." He is not under the law as a curse and condemnation, but he is in
it, and he delights to be in it as his rule of life; he delights,
moreover, to meditate in it, to read it by day, and think upon it by
night. He takes a text and carries it with him all day long; and in the
night-watches, when sleep forsakes his eyelids, he museth upon the Word
of God. In the day of his prosperity he sings psalms out of the Word of
God, and in the night of his affliction he comforts himself with
promises out of the same book. "The law of the Lord" is the daily bread
of the true believer. And yet, in David's day, how small was the volume
of inspiration, for they had scarcely anything save the first five books
of Moses! How much more, then, should we prize the whole written Word
which it is our privilege to have in all our houses! But, alas, what
ill-treatment is given to this angel from heaven! We are not all Berean
searchers of the Scriptures. How few among us can lay claim to the
benediction of the text! Perhaps some of you can claim a sort of
negative purity, because you do not walk in the way of the ungodly; but
let me ask you - Is your delight in the law of God? Do you study God's
Word? Do you make it the man of your right hand - your best companion
and hourly guide? If not, this blessing belongeth not to you.

[Psalms 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 1:3</span></span>

3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that
bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither;
and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.

"And he shall be like a tree planted;" not a wild tree, but "a tree
planted," chosen, considered as property, cultivated and secured from
the last terrible uprooting, for "every plant, which my heavenly Father
hath not planted, shall be rooted up:" [Mat
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#013.md). "By the rivers of water;" so
that even if one river should fail, he hath another. The rivers of
pardon and the rivers of grace, the rivers of the promise and the rivers
of the communion with Christ, are never-failing sources of supply. He is
"like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his
fruit in his season;" not unseasonable graces, like untimely figs, which
are never full-flavoured. But the man who delights in God's Word, being
taught by it, bringeth forth patience in the time of suffering, faith in
the day of trial, and holy joy in the hour of prosperity. Fruitfulness
is an essential quality of: a gracious man, and that fruitfulness should
be seasonable. "His leaf also shall not wither;" his faintest word shall
be everlasting; his little deeds of love shall be had in remembrance.
Not simply shall his fruit be preserved, but his leaf also. He shall
neither lose his beauty nor his fruitfulness. "And whatsoever he doeth
shall prosper." Blessed is the man who hath such a promise as this. But
we must not always estimate the fulfilment of a promise by our own
eye-sight. How often, my brethren, if we judge by feeble sense, may we
come to the mournful conclusion of Jacob, "All these things are against
me!" For though we know our interest in the promise, yet are we so tried
and troubled, that sight sees the very reverse of what that promise
foretells. But to the eye of faith this word is sure, and by it we
perceive that our works are prospered, even when everything seems to go
against us. It is not outward prosperity which the Christian most
desires and values; it is soul prosperity which he longs for. We often,
like Jehoshaphat, make ships to go to Tarshish for gold, but they are
broken at Ezion-geber; but even here there is a true prospering, for it
is often for the soul's health that we should be poor, bereaved, and
persecuted. Our worst things are often our best things. As there is a
curse wrapped up in the wicked man's mercies, so there is a blessing
concealed in the righteous man's crosses, losses, and sorrows. The
trials of the saint are a divine husbandry, by which he grows and brings
forth abundant fruit.

[Psalms 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 1:4</span></span>

4 The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth
away.

We have now come to the second head of the Psalm. In this verse the
contrast of the ill estate of the wicked is employed to heighten the
colouring of that fair and pleasant picture which precedes it. The more
forcible translation of the Vulgate and of the Septuagint version is -
"Not so the ungodly, not so." And we are hereby to understand that
whatever good thing is said of the righteous is not true in the case of
the ungodly. Oh! how terrible is it to have a double negative put upon
the promises! and yet this is just the condition of the ungodly. Mark
the use of the term "ungodly," for, as we have seen in the opening of
the Psalm, these are the beginners in evil, and are the least offensive
of sinners. Oh! if such is the sad state of those who quietly continue
in their morality, and neglect their God; what must be the condition of
open sinners and shameless infidels? The first sentence is a negative
description of the ungodly, and the second is the positive picture. Here
is their character - "they are like chaff," intrinsically worthless,
dead, unserviceable, without substance, and easily carried away. Here,
also, mark their doom - "The wind driveth away;" death shall hurry them
with its terrible blast into the fire in which they shall be utterly
consumed.

[Psalms 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 1:5</span></span>

5 Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in
the congregation of the righteous.

They shall stand there to be judged, but not to be acquitted. Fear shall
lay hold upon-them there; they shall not stand their ground; they shall
flee away; they shall not stand in their own defence; for they shall
blush and be covered with eternal contempt.

Well may the saints long for heaven, for no evil men shall dwell there,
"nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous." All our
congregations upon earth are mixed. Every Church has one devil in it.
The tares grow in the same furrows as the wheat. There is no floor which
is as yet thoroughly purged from chaff. Sinners mix with saints, as
dross mingles with gold. God's precious diamonds still lie in the same
field with pebbles. Righteous Lots are this side heaven continually
vexed by the men of Sodom. Let us rejoice then, that in "the general
assembly and church of the firstborn" above, there shall by no means be
admitted a single unrenewed soul. Sinners cannot live in heaven. They
would be out of their element. Sooner could a fish live upon a tree than
the wicked in Paradise. Heaven would be an intolerable hell to an
impenitent man, even if he could be allowed to enter; but such a
privilege shall never be granted to the man who perseveres in his
iniquities. May God grant that we may have a name and a place in his
courts above!

[Psalms 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 1:6</span></span>

6 For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the
ungodly shall perish.

Or, as the Hebrew hath it yet more fully, "The Lord is knowing the way
of the righteous." He is constantly looking on their way, and though it
may be often in mist and darkness, yet the Lord knoweth it. If it be in
the clouds and tempest of affliction, he understandeth it. He numbereth
the hairs of our head; he wilt not Suffer any evil to befall us. "He
knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth
as gold." ([Job 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#010).md) "But the way of
the ungodly shall perish." Not only shall they perish themselves, but
their way shall perish too. The righteous carves his name upon the rock,
but the wicked writes his remembrance here, which shall never be fully
reaped till he enters the enjoyments of eternity but as for the wicked,
he ploughs the sea, and though there may seem to be a shining trail
behind his keel, yet the waves shall pass over it, and the place that
knew him shall know him no more for ever. The very "way" of the ungodly
shall perish. If it exist in remembrance, it shall be in the remembrance
of the bad; for the Lord will cause the name of the wicked to rot, to
become a stench in the nostrils of the good, and to be only known to the
wicked themselves by its putridity.

May the Lord cleanse our hearts and our ways, that we may escape the
doom of the ungodly, and enjoy the blessedness of the righteous!
