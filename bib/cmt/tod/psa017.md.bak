### [Psalms Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 17:0</span></span>

Title and Subject - A Prayer of David. David would not have been a man
after God's own heart, if he had not been a man of prayer. He was a
master in the sacred art of supplication. He flies to prayer in all
times of need, as a pilot speeds to the harbour in the stress of
tempest. So frequent were David's prayers that they could not all be
dated and entitled; and hence this simply bears the author's name, and
nothing more. The smell of the furnace is upon the present Psalm, but
there is evidence in the last verse that he who wrote it came unharmed
out of the flame. We have in the present plaintive song, An appeal to
Heaven from the persecutions of earth. A spiritual eye may see Jesus
here.

Divisions - There are no very clear lines of demarcation between the
parts; but we prefer the divisions adopted by that precious old
commentator, David Dickson. In [Psa
17:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001.md), David craves justice in the
controversy between him and his oppressors. In [Psa
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#005.md) and [Psa
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#006.md), he requests of the Lord grace to
act rightly while under the trial. From [Psa
17:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#007.md), he seeks protection from his
foes, whom he graphically describes; and in [Psa
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#013.md) and [Psa
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014.md), pleads that they may be
disappointed; closing the whole in the most comfortable confidence that
all would certainly be well with himself at the last.

Hints to Preachers

[Psa 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001.md) - The voice of Jesus - our
Righteousness, and our own voice. Work out the thought of both coming up
to the ear of heaven, noting the qualities of our prayer as indicated by
the psalmist's language, such as earnestness, perseverance, sincerity,
etc.

[Psa 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#002.md) - "Let my sentence come
forth from thy presence."

I. When it will come.

II\. Who dare meet it now.

III\. How to be among them.

[Psa 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#003.md) - "Thou hast proved mine
heart." The metal, the furnace, the refiner, etc.

[Psa 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#003.md) - "Thou hast visited me in
the night."

I. Glorious visitor.

II\. Favoured individual.

III\. Peculiar season.

IV\. Refreshing remembrance.

V. Practical result.

[Psa 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#003) (last sentence.md) -
Transgressions of the lip, and how to avoid them.

[Psa 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#004.md) - The highway and the
by-paths. The world and sin. "The paths of the destroyer" - a
significant name for transgression.

[Psa 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#005.md) - "Hold up."

I. Who? God.

II\. What? "My goings."

III\. When? Present tense.

IV\. Where? "In thy paths."

V. Why? "That my footsteps slip not."

[Psa 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#005.md) - Let me observe David and
learn to pray as he prayed, "Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my
footsteps slip not."

I. See his course. He speaks of his "goings." Religion does not allow a
man to sit still. He speaks of his goings "in God's paths." These are
threefold.

(1). The path of his commands.

(2). The path of his ordinances.

(3). The path of his dispensations.

II\. His concern respecting this course. It is the language of

\(1\) conviction;

\(2\) of apprehension;

\(3\) of weakness;

\(4\) of confidence.

\- William Jay.

[Psa 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#006.md) - Two words, both great,
though little, "call" and "hear." Two persons, one little and the other
great, "I," "Thee, O God." Two tenses: past, "I have;" future, "Thou
wilt." Two wonders, that we do not call more, and that God hears such
unworthy prayers.

[Psa 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#007) (first sentence.md) - See
Exposition. A view of divine lovingkindness desired.

[Psa 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#007.md) - "O thou," etc. God, the
Saviour of believers.

[Psa 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#008.md) - Two most suggestive
emblems of tenderness and care. Involving in the one case living unity,
as the eye with the body, and in the other, loving relationship, as the
bird and its young.

[Psa 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014.md) - "Men of the world, which
have their portion in this life." Who they are? What they have? Where
they have it? What next?

[Psa 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014.md) - "Men which are thy hand."
Providential control and use of wicked men.

[Psa 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015.md) - This is the language

\(1\) Of a man whose mind is made up; who has decided for himself; who
does not suspend his conduct upon the resolution of others.

\(2\) Of a man rising in life, and with great prospects before him.

\(3\) It is the language of a Jew.

[Psa 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015.md) - The beholding of God's
face signifies two things.

I. The enjoyment of his favour.

II\. Intimate communion with him.

\- William Jay.

[Psa 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015.md) - See "Spurgeon's Sermons,"
No. 25. Title, "The Hope of Future Bliss." Divisions.

I. The Spirit of this utterance.

II\. The matter of it.

III\. The contrast implied in it.

[Psa 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015.md) - To see God and to be like
him, the believer's desire - J. Fawcett.

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Title

"A prayer of David." Since many of the Psalms consist of prayers, the
question may be asked why such an inscription more especially belongs to
this. But though the others contain divers prayers mixed with other
matters, this is a supplication through its whole course. - The
Venerable Bede, 672-735.

[Psa 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001.md)

"Hear... attend... give ear." This petition repeated thrice, indicates a
great power of feeling and many tears; because the craft of the ungodly,
in truth, grieves and afflicts the spiritual man more than their power
and violence, for we can get a knowledge of open force and violence,
and, when we see the danger, can in some way guard against it. - Martin
Luther.

[Psa 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001.md)

"That goeth not out of feigned lips." - There are such things as
"feigned lips;" a contradiction between the heart and the tongue, a
clamour in the voice and scoffing in the soul, a crying to God, "Thou
art my father, the guide of my youth;" and yet speaking and doing evil
to the utmost of our power ([Jer 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#004.md),
[Jer 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#005).md), as if God could be imposed
upon by fawning pretences, and, like old Isaac, take Jacob for Esau, and
be cozened by the smell of his garments; as if he could not discern the
negro heart under an angel's garb .... This is an unworthy conceit of
God, to fancy that we can satisfy got inward sins, and avert approaching
judgments by external offerings, by a loud voice, with a false heart, as
if God (like children), would be pleased with the glittering of an empty
shell, or the rattling of stones, the chinking of money, a mere voice,
and crying without inward frames and intentions of service. - Stephen
Charnock.

[Psa 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001.md)

"Not out of feigned lips." It is observable, that the eagle soareth on
high, little intending to fly to heaven, but to gain her prey; and so it
is that many do carry a great deal of seeming devotion in lifting up
their eyes towards heaven; but they do it only to accomplish with more
ease, safety, and applause their wicked and damnable designs here on
earth; such as without are Catos, within Neros; hear them, no man
better; search and try them, no man worse; they have Jacob's voice, but
Esau's hands; they profess like saints, but practise little Satans; they
have their long prayers, but short prayings; they are like apothecaries'
gallipots - having without the title of some excellent preservative, but
within they are full of deadly poison; counterfeit holiness is their
cloak for all manner of villanies, and the midwife to bring forth all
their devilish designs. - Peter Bales, in Spencer's "Things New and
Old."

[Psa 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001.md)

"Not out of feigned lips." Not only a righteous cause, but a righteous
prayer are urged as motives why God should hear. Calvin remarks on the
importance of joining prayer to the testimony of a good conscience, lest
we defraud God of his honour by not committing all judgment to him. - J.
J. Stewart Perowne.

[Psa 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001.md)

Though thy prayer be never so well framed in regard of words, and
reverently performed as to thy external gestures; yet all is nothing, if
thy heart be not in the duty. For prayer is not a work of the head, or
hand, or eyes only, but chiefly a work of the heart, and therefore
called in Scripture, the "pouring out of the soul" ([Sa1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#015).md); and the "pouring out of the
heart." [Psa 62:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#008.md). And, indeed, the
very soul of prayer lieth in the pouring out of the soul before the
Lord. Whensoever, therefore, thou drawest near unto God in prayer, let
it be with thine heart and soul, otherwise thou canst have no assurance
of audience, and acceptance; for as Cyprian speaketh, Quomodo te audiri
a Deo postulas, etc. How canst thou expect the Lord should hear thee,
when thou hearest not thyself? or that he should regard thy prayers,
when thou regardest not what thou prayest? Certainly that prayer
reacheth not the heart of God, which reacheth not our own. - Thomas
Gouge, 1605-1681.

[Psa 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#002.md)

David appeals unto God to judge the righteousness of his heart towards
Saul - "Let my sentence come forth from thy presence." From Saul and his
courtiers there comes a hard sentence; they call me traitor, they call
me rebel: but, Lord, leave me not unto their sentence, "Let my sentence
come from thy presence;" that I know will be another sentence than what
cometh from them, for thou hast proved me, and tried me, and findest
nothing in me. - Jeremiah Burroughs.

[Psa 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#003.md)

"Thou hast proved mine heart:" -

What! take it at adventure, and not try

What metal it is made of? No, not I.

Should I now lightly let it pass,

Take sullen lead for silver, sounding brass,

Instead of solid gold, alas!

What would become of it in the great day

Of making jewels, 'twould be cast away.

The heart thou giv'st me must be such a one,

As is the same throughout. I will have none

But that which will abide the fire.

Tis not a glitt'ring outside I desire,

Whose seeming shows do soon expire:

But real worth within, which neither dross,

Nor base alloys, make subject unto loss.

If, in the composition of thine heart,

A stubborn, steely wilfulness have part,

That will not bow and bend to me,

Save only in a mere formality

Of tinsel-trimm'd hypocrisy,

I care not for it, though it show as fair

As the first blush of the sun-gilded air.

The heart that in my furnace will not melt,

When it the glowing heat thereof hath felt,

Turn liquid, and dissolve in tears

Of true repentance for its faults, that hears

My threat'ning voice, and never fears,

Is not an heart worth having. If it be

An heart of stone, 'tis not an heart for me.

The heart, that, cast into my furnace, spits

And sparkles in my face, falls into fits

Of discontented grudging, whines

When it is broken of its will, repines

At the least suffering, declines

My fatherly correction, is an heart

On which I care not to bestow mine art.

The heart that vapours out itself in smoke.

And with these cloudy shadows thinks to cloke

Its empty nakedness, how much

Soever thou esteemest, it is such

As never will endure my touch.

I'll bring it to my furnace, and there see

What it will prove, what it is like to be.

If it be gold, it will be sure

The hottest fire that can be to endure.

And I shall draw it out more pure.

Affliction may refine, but cannot waste

That heart wherein my love is fixed fast.

Francis Quarles.

[Psa 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#003.md)

"Thou hast visited me in the night," etc. In the night the soul is free
form business with the world, and therefore freest for business with
God; and then did God prove and visit David, that is, examine and sift
him, by calling to his mind all his ways and works in former passages;
and the issue of this trial was he found nothing; not that his soul was
empty of good things, or that there was nothing evil in him; but God,
upon examination, found nothing of that evil in him which some men
suspected him of; namely, either any ill will or evil design against
Saul, in reference to whom he called his cause a righteous cause, or
"the right" ([Psa 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001).md); "Hear the
right, O Lord." - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#003.md) (third clause, New
Translation)

"Thou hast smelted me, and found in me no dross." A metaphor taken from
the smelting of metals to purify them from extraneous matter. - Geddes.

[Psa 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#003.md)

"Proved ... visited in the night ... tried." Tribulation, whereby, when
examined, I was found righteous, is called not only night, in that it is
wont to disturb with fear, but fire in that it actually burns. -
Augustine.

[Psa 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#003.md)

"I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress." - Wherefore, if thou
be upon a mountain, look not backward again unto Sodom as Lot's wife
did; if thou be within the ark, fly not out again into the world as
Noah's crow did; if thou be well washed, return not again to the mire as
the hog doth; if thou be clean, run not again to thy filth, as the dog
doth; if thou be going towards the land of Canaan, think not on the
flesh-pots of Egypt; if thou be marching against the host of Midian,
drink not of the waters of Harod; if thou be upon the housetop, come not
down; if thou have set thy hand to the plough, look not behind thee;
remember not those vices which are behind thee. - Thomas Playfere.

[Psa 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#003.md), [Psa
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#004.md), [Psa
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#005.md)

Where there is true grace, there is hatred of all sin, for hatred is
πρὸς τὸ γένος. Can a man be resolved to commit what he hates? No, for
his inward aversion would secure him more against it than all outward
obstacles. As this inward purpose of a good man is against all sin, so
more particularly against that which doth so easily beset him. David
seems in several places to be naturally inclined to lying, but he takes
up a particular resolution against it: ([Psa
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#003).md), "I am purposed that my mouth
shall not transgress;" ומּהי - I have contrived to waylay and intercept
the sin of lying when it hath an occasion to approach me. A good man
hath not only purposes, but he endeavours to fasten and strengthen those
purposes by prayer; so David ([Psa
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#005).md), "Hold up my goings in thy
paths, that my footsteps slip not." He strengthens himself by stirring
up a liveliness in duty, and by avoiding occasions of sin; ([Psa
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#004).md), "I have kept me from the paths
of the destroyer;" whereas, a wicked man neither steps out of the way of
temptation, nor steps up to God for strength against it. - Stephen
Charnock.

[Psa 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#004.md)

"Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me
from the paths of the destroyer:" as if he had said, Would you know how
it comes to pass that I escape those ungodly works and practices which
men ordinarily take liberty to do? I must ascribe it to the good word of
God; it is this I consult with, and by it I am kept from those foul ways
whereinto others, that make no use of the word for their defence, are
carried by Satan the destroyer. Can we go against sin and Satan with a
better weapon than Christ used to vanquish the tempter with? And,
certainly, Christ did it to set us an example how we should come armed
into the field against them; for Christ could with one beam shot from
his Deity (if he had pleased to exert it), have as easily laid the bold
fiend at his foot, as afterward he did them that came to attack him; but
he chose rather to conceal the majesty of his Divinity, and let Satan
come up closer to him, that so he might confound him with the word, and
thereby give him a proof of that sword of his saints, which he was to
leave them for their defence against the same enemy. The devil is set
out by the leviathan ([Isa 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001).md), him
God threatens to punish with his strong sword: alluding to that great
fish the whale which fears no fish like the sword-fish, by whom this
great devourer of all other fish is so often killed; for, receiving one
prick from his sword, he hasteneth to the shore, and beats himself
against it till he dies. Thus the devil, the great devourer of souls,
who sports himself in the sea of this world, as the leviathan in the
waters, and swallows the greatest part of mankind without any power to
make resistance against him, is himself vanquished by the word. When he
has to do with a saint armed with this sword, and instructed how to use
this weapon, he then, and not till then, meets his match. - William
Gurnall.

[Psa 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#004.md)

"By the word of thy lips," etc. It is a great relief against temptations
to have the word ready. The word is called, "The sword of the Spirit,"
[Eph 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#017.md). In spiritual conflicts
there is none like to that. Those that ride abroad in time of danger;
will not be without a sword. We are in danger; and had need handle the
sword of the Spirit. The more ready the Scripture is with us, the
greater advantage in our conflicts and temptations. When the devil came
to assault Christ, he had Scripture ready for him, whereby he overcame
the tempter. The door is barred upon Satan, and he cannot find such easy
entrance when the word is hid in our hearts, and made use of
pertinently. "I write unto you, young men, because ye are strong." Where
lies their strength? "And the word of God abideth in you, and ye have
overcome the wicked one," [Jo1 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#014.md).
Oh, it is a great advantage when we have the word not only by us, but in
us, engrafted in the heart; when it is present with us, we are more able
to resist the assaults of Satan. Either a man forgets the Word, or hath
lost his affection to it, before he can be drawn to sin. - Thomas
Manton.

[Psa 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#005.md)

"Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not." Lord,
whatsoever the wrath of Saul be against me, yet let neither that, nor
any other thing put me out of thy way, but keep my heart close unto
thee, and keep my paths in thy way; let not my footsteps so much as
slide from thee, for, Lord, they watch for my halting; if they can find
but the least slip from me, they take advantage of it to the utmost; and
I am a poor and a weak creature, therefore Lord help me, that my
footsteps may not slide. - Jeremiah Burroughs.

[Psa 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#005.md)

"Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not." As a stone
cast up into the air cannot go any higher, neither yet there abide when
the power of the hurler ceaseth to drive it; even so, seeing our corrupt
nature can go downward only, and the devil, the world, and the flesh,
driveth to the same way; how can we proceed further in virtue, or stand
therein, when we are tempted, if our merciful and good God do not by his
Holy Spirit, from time to time, guide and govern us? - Robert Cawdray.

[Psa 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#005.md)

"Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not." Lord, hold
me up, that I may hold out. Thou hast set the crown at the end of the
race; let me run the race, that I may wear the crown. It was Beza's
prayer, and let it be ours, "Lord, perfect what thou hast begun in me,
that I may not suffer shipwreck when I am almost at the haven." - Thomas
Watson.

[Psa 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#005.md)

In fierce assaults and strong temptations, when Satan layeth siege to
the soul, shooting his fiery darts, and using stratagems of policy,
joining his endeavours with our corruptions, as wind with tide, then we
have cause to pray as David, "Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my
footsteps slip not." The apostle also found he had need of help from
heaven when he was assaulted, and therefore he prayed "thrice," that the
thing that he feared might depart from him. 2 Cor 12. Christ hath taught
us to pray daily, "Lead us not into temptation," for it is dangerous;
and then temptations are most dangerous, when, 1. Most suitable - when
Satan joins with our disposition or constitution; 2. Continual; 3. When
opportunity and power is greatest. - Joseph Symonds.

[Psa 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#006.md)

"I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me." I have cried, says the
Psalmist, because thou hast heard me. One would think he should have
said contrariwise: thou hast heard me because I have cried; yet, he
says, I have cried because thou hast heard me; to show that crying doth
not always go before hearing with God, as it doth with us; but that God
will not only hear our cry, but also hear us before we cry, and will
help us. - T. Playfere.

[Psa 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#006.md)

"I have called upon thee," etc. Prayer is the best remedy in a calamity.
This is indeed a true catholicon, a general remedy for every malady. Not
like the empiric's catholicon, which sometimes may work, but for the
most part fails, but that which upon assured evidence and constant
experience hath its probatum est, being that which the most wise,
learned, honest, and skilful Physician that ever was, or can be, hath
prescribed, even he that teacheth us how to bear what is to be borne, or
how to heal and help what hath been borne. - William Gouge, 1575-1653.

[Psa 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#006.md)

I have called upon thee formerly, therefore, Lord, hear me now. It will
be a great comfort to us if trouble, when it comes, finds the wheels of
prayer a-going, for then may we come with the more boldness to the
throne of grace. Tradesmen are willing to oblige those that have been
long their customers. - Matthew Henry.

[Psa 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#008.md)

"Keep me as the apple of the eye." He prays for deliverance ([Psa
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#007).md), "Show thy marvellous
lovingkindness" to me; Lord, my straits they are marvellous, I know not
what to do, whither to turn me, but my eyes are towards thee; as straits
are marvellous, so let the lovingkindness of God be marvellous towards
me, and "Keep me as the apple of thy eye." O Lord: unto them I am but a
dog, a vile creature in the eyes of Saul and those about him but blessed
be thy name, I can look up to thee, and know that I am dear unto thee as
the apple of thy eye. All the saints of God are dear to God at all
times, but the persecuted saints, they are the apple of God's eye; if at
any time they are deal' to God, then especially when they are most
persecuted; now they are the apple of his eye, and the apple of an eye
is weak, and little able to resist any hurt, but so much the more is the
man tender of the apple of his eye. The saints are weak and shiftless
for themselves, but the Lord is so much the more tender over them. -
Jeremiah Burroughs.

[Psa 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#008.md)

Does it not appear to thee to be a work of providence, that considering
the weakness of the eye, he has protected it with eyelids, as with
doors, which whenever there is occasion to use it are opened, and are
again closed in sleep? And that it may not receive injury from the
winds, he has planted on it eyelashes like a strainer; and over the eyes
has disposed the eyebrows like a penthouse, so that the sweat from the
head may do no mischief. - Socrates, in Xenophon.

[Psa 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#009.md)

"From the wicked:" as though he had said, They are equally enemies to
thee and me; not more opposite to me by their cruelty, than by their
wickedness they are to thee. Vindicate then, at once, thyself, and
deliver me." - John Howe.

[Psa 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#010.md)

"They are inclosed in their own fat," or their fat has inclosed them;
either their eyes, that they can hardly see out of them, or their
hearts, so that they are stupid and senseless, and devoid of the fear of
God; the phrase is expressive of the multitude of their wealth, and
increase of power, by which they were swelled with pride and vanity, and
neither feared God nor regarded man; so the Targum paraphrases it,
"their riches are multiplied, their fat covers them." - John Gill.

[Psa 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#010.md)

"They are inclosed in their own fat." Their worldly prosperity puffeth
them up, and makes them insensible and obdurate against all reason and
just fear; and the Scripture doth use this term of a fattened heart in
this sense, because that the fat of man hath no feeling in it, and those
that are very fat are less subject to the passion of fear. - John
Diodati.

[Psa 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#010.md)

"They are inclosed in their own fat." To say a man is fat, often means
he is very proud. Of one who speaks pompously it is said, "What can we
do? tassi kullap ināl," that is, "from the fat of his flesh he declares
himself." "Oh, the fat of his mouth! how largely he talks!" "Take care,
fellow! or I will restrain the fat of thy mouth." - J. Roberts, in
"Oriental Illustrations:" 1844.

"They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes
bowing down to the earth. A man who has people watching him to find out
a cause for accusation against him to the king, or to great men, says,
"Yes, they are around my legs and my feet; their eyes are always open;
they are ever watching my 'suvadu,' 'steps;'" that is, they are looking
for the impress or footsteps in the earth. For this purpose the eyes of
the enemies of David were "bowing down to the earth." - Joseph Roberts.

[Psa 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#011.md)

"They have now compassed us in our steps." Like those who destroy game
by battue, and so make a ring around their prey from which their victims
cannot escape. - C.H.S.

"They have set their eyes bowing down to the earth." The allusion
probably is to the huntsman tracing the footmarks of the animal he
pursues. - Religious Tract Society's Commentary.

[Psa 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#011.md)

"They have set their eyes bowing to the earth." It is an allusion, as I
conceive, to hunters, who go poring upon the ground to prick the hare,
or to find the print of the hare's claw, when the hounds are at a loss,
and can make nothing of it by the scent. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#012.md)

"Like a lion," etc. In "Paradise Lost," we have a fine poetical
conception of the arch enemy prowling around our first parents when he
first beheld their happiness, and resolved to ruin them.

\_\_\_\_\_About them round

A lion now, he stalks with fiery glare;

Then, as a tiger, who by chance hath spied

In some purlieu, two gentle fawns at play,

Straight crouches close, then rising, changes oft

His couchant watch, as one who chose his ground,

Whence rushing he might surest seize them both,

Grip'd in each paw.

John Milton.

[Psa 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#012.md)

We were consulting as to the best means of getting at a rhinoceros cow
which we saw standing at some distance under a tree, when a troop of
impalas came charging down with a fine old lioness after them. We went
and saw her lying down, but so flat to the ground, head and all, that no
man could shoot with any certainty; and she never for a moment took her
eyes from us. When we got up to her, she was lying down flat as a plate
to the ground; but her head might have been on a pivot, as her watchful
eye glared on us all round, without appearing to move her body, as we
decreased the circle, in the hopes she would stand up and give us a fair
chance of a shot behind the shoulder.... I looked for a tree to climb
up, near enough to make tolerably sure of my shot, and was just getting
up one, when the lioness made off. - William Charles Baldwin, F.R.G.S.,
in "African Hunting," 1863.

[Psa 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#013.md)

"The wicked, which is thy sword." - The devil and his instruments both
are God's instruments, therefore "the wicked" are called his "sword,"
his "axe" ([Psa 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#013.md); [Isa
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#015).md); now let God alone to wield the
one, and handle the other. He is but a bungler that hurts and hackles
his own legs with his own axe; which God should do if his children
should be the worse for Satan's temptations. Let the devil choose his
way, God is a match for him at every weapon. If he will try it by force
of arms, and assaults the saints by persecution, as the "Lord of hosts"
he will oppose him. If by policy and subtlety, he is ready there also.
The devil and his whole council are but fools to God; nay, their wisdom
foolishness. - William Gurnall.

"Thy sword.... thy hand." Thou canst as easily command and manage them,
as a man may wield his sword, or move his hand. Wilt thou suffer thine
own sword, thine own hand, to destroy thine own servant? - J. Howe.

[Psa 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014) (first clause.md)

How wonderful are the dispensations of the providence of God, who can
use even the wicked to promote the present happiness and the final
salvation of his saints! - J. Edwards, M.A., 1856.

[Psa 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014.md)

"Men of the world, which have their portion in this life." Time .and
this lower world, bound all their hopes and fears. They have no serious
believing apprehensions of anything beyond this present life; therefore,
have nothing to withhold them from the most injurious violence, if thou
withhold them not; men that believe not another world, are the ready
actors of any imaginable mischiefs and tragedies in this. - John Howe.

[Psa 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014.md)

"Men which are thy hand," etc. What shall we say then? Because God
maketh use of thy sins, art thou excused? Is not thine evil evil,
because he picketh good out of it? Deceive not thyself therein. When
thou hast done such service to thy Master and Maker, though seven and
seven years, as Jacob did service to Laban, thou shalt lose thy wages
and thy thanks too. Oh, well were thou if thou didst but lose, for thou
shalt also gain a sorrowful advantage. It is unprofitable nay, miserable
service which thou hast thus bestowed. Babylon shall be the hammer of
the Lord a long time to bruise the nations, himself afterwards bruised;
Asshur his rod to scourge his people, but Asshur shall be more scourged.
These hammers, rods, axes, saws, other instruments, when they have done
their offices, which they never meant, shall be thrown themselves into
the fire, and burnt to ashes. Satan did service to God, it cannot be
denied, in the afflicting of Job, winnowing of Peter, buffeting of Paul,
executing of Judas, and God did a work in all these, either to prove
patience, or to confirm faith, or to try strength, or to commend
justice; yet is Satan "reserved in chains, under darkness, to the
retribution of the great day." Judas did service to God, in getting
honour to his blessed name for the redemption of mankind, whilst the
world endureth, yet was his wages an alder tree to hang himself upon,
and which is worse, he hangeth in hell for eternal generations. He had
his wages, and lost his wages. That which the priest gave him, he lost,
and lost his apostleship, but gained the recompense of everlasting
unhappiness, and lies in the lowest lake, for the worm and death to gnaw
upon without ceasing. - John King.

[Psa 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014.md)

"Thy hand." The hand of God, his correcting or cherishing hand,
sometimes is an immediate, and sometimes a mediate hand. Sometimes it is
immediate, when God by himself doth chasten, or punish, or afflict, when
no second cause doth appear or intervene. So it may seem Satan means,
when he saith ([Job 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#011).md), "Put forth
thy hand," that is, do it thine own self, let no other have the handling
of Job but thyself. God doth send such immediate afflictions; a man is
afflicted in his body, in his estate, and many other ways, and he cannot
find anything in the creature whence it should come; it is an immediate
stroke of God, he cannot see how, or which way, or at what door this
evil came in upon him; therefore it is called a creating of evil. [Isa
45:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#007.md). "I make peace, and create evil."
Now creation is out of nothing, there is nothing out of which it is
wrought. So many times God bringeth evil upon a people or person when
there is no appearance of second causes, no matter out of which it is
made, but it comes as a creature, formed by the only hand of God.
Sometimes likewise it is called God's hand, when it is the hand of a
creature; it is God's hand in a creature's hand; God's hand when it is
the hand of wicked men, God's hand when it is Satan's hand. So that
place is translated ([Psa 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#013.md), [Psa
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014).md), "Deliver my soul from the
wicked, which is thy sword: from men which are thy hand:" so that "thy
hand" may be understood of an instrument; Satan himself is God's hand to
punish in that sense, as wicked men here are said to be God's hand:
"from men which are thy hand," though there be other readings of that
place; some read it, deliver me from men by thy hand; and others,
deliver me from men of thy hand; but our translation may very well carry
the sense of the original in it, "from men which are thy hand;" as
Nebuchadnezzar, that wicked king, is called God's servant ([Jer
43:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#010).md), "I will send and take
Nebuchadnezzar my servant:" God speaks of him as his servant, or as his
hand in the thing. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014.md)

"Men of the world, which have their portion in this life." The large
portion of the wicked in the things of this world, may tell the
righteous of how little value this is, in the account of God; in that
these things are often given to his enemies plentifully, when denied in
such a measure to his children. Now this cannot be because he loves or
favours his enemies most; but because these lower things, given them in
what degree soever, are so mean in his account, as that his chosen may
learn by his distribution of them, to regard them as he does; namely, as
no part of their felicity, but as common favours to all his creatures,
good or bad, enemies or friends. - Daniel Wilcox.

[Psa 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014.md)

"Men which have their portion in this life." God gives wicked men a
portion here to show unto them what little good there is in all these
things, and to show the world what little good there is in all the
things that are here below in the world. Certainly if they were much
good they should never have them: it is an argument there is no great
excellency in the strength of body, for an ox hath it more than you; an
argument there is no great excellency in agility of body, for a dog hath
it more than you; an argument no great excellency in gay clothes, for a
peacock hath them more than you; an argument there is not any great
excellency in gold and silver, for the Indians that know not God have
them more than you; and if these things had any great worth in them,
certainly God would never give them to wicked men - a certain argument.
As it is an argument there is no great evil in affliction in this world,
because that the saints are so much afflicted; so no great argument
there is any great good in this world, for the wicked they enjoy so much
of it. Luther hath such an expression as this in his comment upon
Genesis, saith he, "The Turkish empire, as great as it is, is but a
crumb, that the Master of the family, that God, casts to dogs:" the
whole Turkish empire, such an esteem had Luther of it; and indeed it is
no more. All the things of the world, God in giving of them to Turks and
wicked ones, his enemies, shows there is not much excellency and good in
them: God therefore will cast them promiscuously up and down in the
world, because he looks upon them as worthless things; God doth not so
much regard whether men be prepared to give him the glory of them, yea
or no, they shall have them; however he is content to venture them.
Indeed, when God comes unto his choice mercies in Christ, there he looks
to have glory from them, and he doth never give them to any, but first
he prepares them, that they may give him the glory of those mercies. But
it is otherwise with others; as, suppose you see a man gathering of
crabs, although swine be under the tree, he cares not much to drive them
away; they are but crabs, let them have them; but if he were gathering
any choice and precious fruit, if any swine should come under, he drives
them away. As for outward things, crabs, the Lord suffers the swine of
the world to come grunting and take them up; but when he comes to his
choice mercies in his Christ, there he makes a distinction. Oh, this is
precious fruit! A blacksmith that is working upon iron, though a great
many cinders and little bits of iron fly up and down, he regards them
not; but a goldsmith that is working upon gold, he preserves every rag,
and every dust of gold; and a lapidary that is working upon precious
stones, every little bit he will be sure to preserve; a carpenter that
is only hewing of timber, he regards it not much if chips fly up and
down; but it is not so with a lapidary. So these outward things are but
as the chips and cinders, and such kind of things as those are, and
therefore God ever gives a portion to wicked men out of them. - Jeremiah
Burroughs.

[Psa 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014.md)

"Men which have their portion in this life." I have read of Gregory,
that being advanced to preferment, professed that there was no Scripture
that went so to his heart, that struck such a trembling into his spirit,
that daunted him so much, as this Scripture did: - "Here you have your
reward, son; in your lifetime you have had your pleasure." Oh, this was
a dreadful Scripture that sounded in his ears continually, as Hierom
speaks of that Scripture, "Arise, ye dead, and come to judgment:" night
and day he thought that Scripture sounded in his ears; so Gregory: -
"Here you have your reward; in this life you have had your pleasure."
This was the Scripture that night and day sounded in his ears. O that it
might please God to assist so far, to speak out of this Scripture to
you, that I might make this Scripture ring in your ears even when you
lie upon your beds, after the sermon is done; that yet you may think
this Scripture rings in your ears: "Men of this world, who have their
portion in this life." - Jeremiah Burroughs.

[Psa 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014.md)

"Which have their portion in this life." The earth and the commodities
thereof God distributeth without respect of persons, even to them that
are his children by creation only, and not by adoption. But yet there is
a difference between the Prosperity of the one and the other; for the
one is but with anxiety of heart (even in laughter their heart is
heavy); the others' is with cheerfulness and joy in the Spirit; the
one's is a pledge of the greater preferment in the world to come, the
others' is their whole portion, and as if God should say, "Let them take
that and look for no more." The one's is with the blessing of the
people, who wish they had more; the others' with their curse and hatred,
who are grieved that they have so much." - Miles Smith.

[Psa 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014.md)

"Their portion in this life." The good man's best, and the bad man's
worst, lie in shall be's ([Isa 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#010.md),
[Isa 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#011).md), in reversion. Here Dives
had nothing but his "good things," but hereafter he had no good thing.
Here Lazarus had his "evil things," but afterwards no evil thing. The
good man when he dies, takes his leave of, and departs from, all evil;
and the evil man when he dies, takes his leave of, and departs from, all
his goods, which was all the good he had. "Now he is comforted, but thou
art tormented." [Luk 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#025.md). Oh! 'tis a
sad thing to have one's portion of good only in this life. - Ralph
Venning's "Helps to Piety," 1620-1673.

[Psa 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014.md)

"This life." There is yet another thing to be seen far more monstrous in
this creature; that whereas he is endued with reason and counsel, and
knoweth that this life is like unto a shadow, to a dream, to a tale that
is told, to a watch in the night, to smoke, to chaff which the wind
scattereth, to a water bubble, and such-like fading things; and that
life to come shall never have end; he yet nevertheless setteth his whole
mind most carefully upon this present life, which is today, and tomorrow
is not; but of the life which is everlasting he doth not so much as
think. If this be not a monster, I know not what may be called
monstrous. - Thomas Tymme.

[Psa 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014.md)

What wicked men possess of this world is all that ever they can hope
for: why should we grudge them filled bags, or swelling titles! it is
their whole portion; they now receive their good things. Hast thou food
and clothing? that is children's fare; envy not ungodly men, who flaunt
it in the gallantry of the world: they have more than you; but it is all
they are like to have; the Psalmist gives us an account of their estate.
They are the men of this world, which have their portion in this life,
and whose bellies God filleth with his hid treasure. Whereas thou, O
Christian, who possessest nothing, art heir-apparent of heaven, co-heir
with Jesus Christ, who is the heir of all things, and hast an infinite
mass of riches laid up for thee; so great and infinite, that all the
stars of heaven are too few to account it by: you have no reason to
complain of being kept short; for all that God hath is yours, whether
prosperity or adversity, life or death, all is yours. What God gives is
for your comfort; what he denies or takes away is for your trial: it is
for the increase of those graces which are far more gracious than any
temporal enjoyment. If, by seeing wicked and ungodly men flow in wealth
and ease, when thou art forced to struggle against the inconveniences
and difficulties of a poor estate, thou hast learnt a holy contempt and
disdain of the world, believe it, God hath herein given thee more than
if he had given thee the world itself. - Ezekiel Hopkins.

[Psa 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014.md)

To show that wicked men have often the greatest portion in this world, I
need not speak much; the experience of all ages since the beginning of
the world confirms it, your own observation, I believe, can seal too it;
however, Scripture abundantly evinces it. The first murderer that ever
was, carries possession in his very name: Cain signifies so much. [Gen
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#008.md). Go on in the whole series of
Scripture, and you shall find Joseph persecuted by his brethren; Esau
(as Rivet observes on Gen 32), advanced in the world for a time far
above Jacob; go on, and you find the Israelites, God's peculiar, in
captivity, and Pharaoh upon the throne; Saul ruling, and David in a
cave, or in a wilderness; Job upon the dunghill; Jeremy in the dungeon;
Daniel in the den, and the children in the furnace, and Nebuchadnezzar
on the throne. In the New Testament you have Felix on the bench, Paul at
the bar; Dives in the palace, Lazarus at his gate ([Luk
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#019).md); he clothed in purple, Lazarus
in rags and overspread with sores; he banqueted and fared deliciously
every day, the other desired but the crumbs from the table, and could
not have them; Dives beset with his rich and stately attendance, Lazarus
hath no other society but the dogs which came to lick his sores; all
which Austin and Tertullian against Marcion (lib. 4), conceive to be a
true history of what was really acted, though others think it
parabolical. Job tells us that "the tabernacles of robbers" sometimes
"prosper" ([Job 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#006).md), which
prosperity he at large describes (chap 21 from [Job
21:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#007).md); exalted in "power," [Job
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#007.md); multiplied in their posterity,
[Job 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#008.md), [Job
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#011.md); safe at home, [Job
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#009.md); increased abroad, [Job
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#010.md); have their fill of pleasure,
[Job 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#012.md), and wealth at will, [Job
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#013.md). David speaks his own experience
of this. [Psa 37:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#035.md); [Psa
73:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#007.md). So in the text, they enjoy not
only common favours, as air to breathe in, earth to walk on; their
bellies are filled with his "hid treasure," and that not for themselves
only, but for their posterity too; they "leave the rest of their
substance to their babes;" in a word, "they have their portion in this
life." - John Frost, 1657.

[Psa 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014.md)

A master or lord pays his servant his present wages, while he cuts his
son short in his allowance during his nonage, that he may learn to
depend upon his father for the inheritance. Thus doth God, the great
Lord of all, deal with his slaves, who serve him for the hire of some
temporal advantage; he gives them their present reward and wages; but
though his goodness hath determined a better portion to be a reward to
the piety and obedience of his children, yet he gives it them in
reversion, little in hand, that they may learn to live upon the promise,
and by faith to depend upon the goodness and faithfulness of their
Father for their heavenly inheritance; that they, walking not by sight
but faith (which is a Christian's work and condition here), may "not
look at the things which are seen," etc. [Co2
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#018.md).... This discovers that rotten
foundation upon which many men build their hopes of heaven. Surely (are
many ready to argue) if God did not love me he would not give me such a
portion in the world. Deceive not thyself in a matter of so great
concernment. Thou mayst as well say God loved Judas, because he had the
bags, or Dives, because he fared deliciously, who are now roaring in
hell. - John Frost.

[Psa 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014.md)

The word which denotes the "belly" may have been fixed, by the divine
Spirit, to indicate the fact, that a very great proportion of the sin of
worldly and depraved characters is connected with the indulgence of base
and degrading lusts; and that they abuse the very bounty of heaven, in
riveting the chain of sense upon their unhappy souls. But let them
remember, that their sensual idolatries will, at last, be followed up by
the most fearful visitations of divine wrath. - John Morison.

[Psa 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014.md)

"Whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure." Wicked men may abound
in earthly things. They may have the earth and the fulness of it, the
earth, and all that is earthly; their bellies are filled by God himself
with hidden treasure. Precious things are usually hidden, and all that's
named treasure, though it be but earthly, hath a preciousness in it.
Hidden treasures of earth fill their bellies who slight the treasures of
heaven, and whose souls shall never have so much as a taste of heavenly
treasures: riches and honour are the lots of their inheritance who have
no inheritance among those whose lot is glory. They have the earth in
their hands ([Job 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#024).md), who have
nothing of heaven in their hearts; they bear sway in the world who are
slaves to the world; they govern and order others at their will who are
led captive by Satan at his will. Be not offended and troubled to see
the reins of government in their hands who know not how to govern
themselves, or to see them rule the world who are unworthy to live in
the world. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014.md)

"Whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure." The hearts of saints
only are filled with the "hidden manna," but the bellies of the wicked
are often filled with hidden treasure; that is, with those dainties and
good things which are virtually hidden in, and formally spring out of,
the belly and bowels of the earth. The Lord easily grants them their
wish in such things, and gives them "their portion," which is all their
portion, "in this life." For as they are but common professors, so these
are but common mercies, such as many of his enemies receive, who are but
fatted as oxen for the slaughter, and fitted for destruction. True
happiness is not to be judged by lands or houses, by gold or silver. The
world is a narrow bound: unless we get beyond the creature, and set our
hopes above this world, we cannot be happy. As hypocrites desire, so
they attain much of the world, but they shall attain no more, how much
soever they seem to desire it. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014.md)

"Whose belly thou fillest." That is, their sensual appetite, as
oftentimes that term is used ([Rom
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#018.md); [Phi
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019).md), "with thy hid treasures;"
namely the riches which either God is wont to hide in the bowels of the
earth, or lock up in the repository of providence, dispensing them at
his own pleasure. - John Howe.

[Psa 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014.md)

"Whose belly thou fillest," etc.: -

Thou from thy hidden store,

Their bellies, Lord, hast fill'd;

Their sons are gorg'd, and what is o'er,

To their sons' sons they yield.

Richard Mant.

[Psa 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014.md)

"They are full of children." So it appears by that which follows, it
ought to be read, and not according to that gross, but easy ( ὑῶν for
υἱῶν), mistake of some transcribers of the seventy. As if in all this he
pleaded thus: "Lord, thou hast abundantly indulged those men already,
what need they more? They have themselves, from thy unregarded bounty,
their own vast swollen desires sufficiently filled, enough for their own
time; and when they can live no longer in their persons, they may in
their posterity, and leave not strangers, but their numerous offspring,
their heirs. Is it not enough that their avarice be gratified, except
their malice be also? that they have whatsoever they can conceive
desirable for themselves, unless they may also infer whatever they can
think mischievous on me?" To this description of his enemies, he ex
opposito, subjoins some account of himself in this his closure of the
Psalm. "As for me," here he is at his statique point; and, after some
appearing discomposure, his spirit returns to a consistency, in
consideration of his own more happy state, which he opposes and prefers
to theirs, in the following respects. That they were wicked, he
righteous. "I will behold thy face in righteousness." That their
happiness was worldly, terrene, such only as did spring from the earth;
his heavenly and divine, such as should result from the face and image
of God. Theirs present, temporary, compassed within this life; his
future, everlasting, to be enjoyed when he should awake. Theirs partial,
defective, such as would but gratify their bestial part, fill their
bellies; his adequate, complete (the εὐδαιμονὶα τοῦ ουνετοῦ, a happiness
of proportion), such as should satisfy the man. "I shall be satisfied,"
etc. - John Howe.

[Psa 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014.md)

"They are full of children." Margin, their children are full. The margin
probably expresses the sense of the Hebrew better than the text. The
literal rendering would be, "satisfied are their sons;" that is, they
have enough to satisfy the wants of their children. The expression,
"they are full of children," is harsh and unnatural, and is not demanded
by the original, or by the main thought in the passage. The obvious
signification is, that they have enough for themselves and for their
children. - Albert Barnes.

[Psa 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015.md)

"I will behold thy face." I look upon the face of a stranger and it
moves me not; but upon a friend, and his face presently transforms mine
into a lively, cheerful aspect. "As iron sharpeneth iron, so doth the
face of a man his friend" ([Pro
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#017).md), puts a sharpness and a
quickness into his looks. The soul that loves God, opens itself to him,
admits his influences and impressions, is easily moulded and wrought to
his will, yields to the transforming power of his appearing glory. There
is no resistant principle remaining when the love of God is perfected in
it; and so overcoming is the first sight of his glory upon the awaking
soul, that it perfects it, and so his likeness, both at once. - John
Howe.

[Psa 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015.md)

"I will behold," etc. In the words we have, 1. The time of his complete
and consummate happiness - "When I awake." 2. The matter of his
happiness, and the manner of enjoying it; the matter and object - "God's
face, or likeness;" the manner of enjoying - "I will behold thy face."
3. His perfect disposition and condition in the state of happiness - "I
shall behold in righteousness," having my heart perfectly conformed to
the will of God, the perfect and adequate rule of righteousness. 4. The
measure of his happiness - "I shall be satisfied;" my happiness will be
full in the measure, without want of anything that can make me happy;
all my desires shall be satisfied, and my happiness in respect of
duration shall be eternal, without a shadow or fear of a change. -
William Colvill.

[Psa 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015.md)

He doth profess his resolution, yet notwithstanding all the danger he
was in, to go on in the ways of God, and expects a gracious issue; but
I, saith he, "will behold thy face in righteousness;" indeed, I cannot
behold the face of the king without danger to me; there are a great many
that run to kill me, and they desire his face; but though I cannot see
his face, yet, Lord, I shall behold thy face; "I will behold thy face,"
and it shall be "in righteousness;" I will still keep on in the ways of
righteousness, and "when I awake" - for I believe that these troubles
will not hold long - I shall not sleep in perpetual sleep, but I shall
awake and be delivered, and then "I shall be satisfied with thy
likeness:" there shall be the manifestation of thy glory to me, that
shall satisfy me for all the trouble that I have endured for thy name's
sake, that my soul shall say, I have enough. - Jeremiah Burroughs.

[Psa 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015.md)

"I shall be satisfied," etc. The fulness of the felicity of heaven may
appear if we compare it with the joys and comforts of the Holy Spirit.
Such they are, as that the Scripture styles them strong consolations
([Heb 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#017).md); full joys ([Joh
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#011).md); joy unspeakable and full of
glory ([Pe1 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#008).md); abounding
consolations. 2 Cor, [Psa 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#005.md). And yet
all the joy and peace that believers are partakers of in this life is
but as a drop to the ocean, as a single cluster to the whole vintage, as
the thyme or honey upon the thigh of a bee to the whole hive fully
fraught with it, or as the break and peep of day to the bright noontide.
But yet these tastes of the water, wine, and honey of this celestial
Canaan, with which the Holy Spirit makes glad the hearts of believers,
are both far more desirable and satisfactory than the overflowing
streams of all earthly felicities. And there are none who have once
tasted of them, but say as the Samaritan woman did, "Lord, give me that
water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw." [Joh
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#015.md). So also the first and early
dawnings of the heavenly light fill the soul with more serenity, and
ravish it with more pure joy, than the brightest sunshine of all worldly
splendour can ever do. I have read of a devout person who but dreaming
of heaven, the signatures and impression it made upon his fancy were so
strong, as that when he awake he knew not his cell, could not
distinguish the night from the day, nor difference by his taste, oil
from wine; still he was calling for his vision and saying, Redde mihi
campos floridos, columnam auream, comitem Hieronymum, assistentes
angelos give me my fresh and fragrant fields again, my golden pillar of
light, Jerome my companion, angels my assistants. If heaven in a dream
produce such ecstacies as drown and overwhelm the exercises of the
senses to inferior objects, what trances and complacencies must the
fruition of it work in those who have their whole rational appetite
filled, and their body beautified with its endless glory? - William
Spurstow, 1656.

[Psa 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015.md)

"I shall be satisfied." Have you never seen how when they were finishing
the interior of buildings they kept the scaffolding up? The old Pope,
when he had Michael Angelo employed in decorating the interior of that
magnificent structure, the Sistine Chapel, demanded that the scaffolding
should be taken down so that he could see the glowing colours that with
matchless skill were being laid on. Patiently and assiduously did that
noble artist labour, toiling by day, and almost by night, bringing out
his prophets and sibyls and pictures wondrous for their beauty and
significance, until the work was done. The day before it was done, if
you had gone into that chapel and looked up, what would you have seen?
Posts, planks, ropes, lime, mortar, slop, dirt. But when all was
finished, the workmen came, and the scaffolding was removed. And then,
although the floor was yet covered with rubbish and litter, when you
looked up, it was as if heaven itself had been opened, and you looked
into the courts of God and angels. Now, the scaffolding is kept around
men long after the fresco is commenced to be painted; and wondrous
disclosures will be made when God shall take down this scaffolding body,
and reveal what you have been doing. By sorrow and by joy; by joys which
are but bright colours, and by sorrows which are but shadows of bright
colours; by prayer; by the influences of the sanctuary; by your
pleasures; by your business; by reverses; by successes and by failures;
by what strengthened your confidence, and by what broke it down; by the
things that you rejoiced in, and by the things that you mourned over -
by all that God is working in you. And you are to be perfected, not
according to the things that you plan, but according to the divine
pattern. Your portrait and mine are being painted, and God by wondrous
strokes and influences is working us up to his own ideal. Over and above
what you are doing for yourself, God is working to make you like him.
And the wondrous declaration is, that when you stand before God, and see
what has been done for you, you shall be "satisfied." Oh, word that has
been wandering solitary and without a habitation ever since the world
began, and the morning stars sang together for joy! Has there ever been
a human creature that could stand on earth while clothed in the flesh,
and say, "I am satisfied"? What is the meaning of the word? Sufficiently
filled; filled full; filled up in every part. And when God's work is
complete, we shall stand before him, and, with the bright ideal and
glorified conception of heavenly aspiration upon us, looking up to God,
and back on ourselves, we shall say, "I am satisfied;" for we shall be
like him. Amen. Why should we not be satisfied? - Henry Ward Beecher, in
"Royal Truths," 1862.

[Psa 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015.md)

"When I awake, I shall be satisfied with thy likeness." He speaks here
of the resurrection; he calls it an awaking, for you know death is
called a sleep. "Those that are asleep in the Lord shall rise first." He
had spoken before of those that had put their happiness in the comforts
of this life, suitable to their bodies, to the animal state of their
bodies; that is clear by the fourteenth verse, "Deliver me from the men
that are thine hand, O Lord, who have their portion in this life, whose
belly thou fillest with thy treasure they are full of children, and
leave to them outward things," bodily things. "But as for me," said he,
"I will behold thy face in thy righteousness" (there is the vision of
God which is his happiness in his soul): "and I shall be satisfied when
I awake" (when I rise again), "with thine image." It is not the image of
God only upon himself that he means here. Why? Because that doth not
satisfy a holy heart, but it is that image of the invisible God which
the human nature of Jesus Christ is, who, in opposition to all these
outward pleasures will be all in all to us; he is a spiritual creature,
his human nature is spiritualised, made glorious, and our bodies shall
be made spiritual likewise. "The body is made for the Lord, and the Lord
for the body," and this when they are both raised up; Christ is raised
up already, and because he hath ordained the one to be serviceable to
the other, he will also raise up our bodies: and when he doth raise me
up saith David, though other men have their bellies full here, and have
animal pleasures they delight in; yet when I shall awake at latter day,
and shall see this image of thine, shall see thy Son, I shall be
satisfied "When I awake, I shall be satisfied with thine image." -
Thomas Goodwin.

[Psa 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015.md)

"I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness." In this Psalm
holy David's afflictions are neither few nor small; his innocency that
is wounded by malicious slanderers, his life that is in jeopardy by
deadly enemies that compass him about; his present condition that is
embittered unto him by the pressing wants of a barren wilderness, while
his foes live deliciously in Saul's court. And yet under the weight and
combination of so many sore evils, David carries himself as one that is
neither hopeless nor forsaken, yea, lays his estate in the balance
against theirs, and in this low ebb of his, vies with them for
happiness; and at last shutting up the Psalm with a triumphant
epiphonema, concludes himself to be by far the better man. "As for me, I
will behold thy face in righteousness. I shall be satisfied, when I
awake, with thy likeness." They, 'tis true, enjoy the face of their
king, whose favour is as a cloud of latter rain promising a fruitful
harvest of many blessings, "but I," saith he, "shall behold the face of
God in righteousness," whose loving, kindness is better than life,
clothed with all its royalties. They have their bellies filled with
hidden treasure, having more than a common hand of bounty opened unto
them; but I have more gladness put into my heart, more than in the time
that their corn and wine increased. They have their portion in hand, and
as being men of this world; but I have mine laid up in the other: "I
shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness." In these words we
have his and every believer's eternal happiness in the other life, set
forth in three particulars as a most effectual antidote against present
troubles and temptations that arise from the malice of wicked men
against them. - William Spurstow.

[Psa 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015.md)

"I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness." The saints in
heaven have not yet awaked in God's likeness. The bodies of the
righteous still sleep, but they are to be satisfied on the resurrection
morn, when they awake. When a Roman conqueror had been at war, and won
great victories, he would return to Rome with his soldiers, enter
privately into his house, and enjoy himself till the next day, when he
would go out of the city to re-enter it publicly in triumph. Now, the
saints, as it were, enter privately into heaven without their bodies;
but on the last day, when their bodies wake up, they will enter into
their triumphal chariots. Methinks I see that grand procession, when
Jesus Christ first of all, with many crowns on his head, with his
bright, glorious, immortal body, shall lead the way. Behind him come the
saints, each of them clapping their hands, or pouring sweet melody from
their golden harps; all entering in triumph. And when they come to
heaven's gates, and the doors are opened wide to let the King of glory
in, how will the angels crowd at the windows and on the housetops, like
the inhabitants in the Roman triumphs, to watch the pompous procession,
and scatter heaven's roses and lilies upon them, crying, "Hallelujah!
hallelujah! hallelujah! the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth." "I shall be
satisfied" in that glorious day when all the angels of God shall come to
see the triumphs of Jesus, and when his people shall be victorious with
him. - Spurgeon's Sermons.

[Psa 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015.md)

"I shall be satisfied... with thy likeness." Let a man who is thirsty be
brought to an ocean of pure water, and he has enough. If there be enough
in God to satisfy the angels, then sure there is enough to satisfy us.
The soul is but finite, but God is infinite. Though God be a good that
satisfies, yet he does not surfeit. Fresh joys spring continually from
his face; and he is as much to be desired after millions of years by
glorified souls as at the first moment. There is a fulness in God that
satisfies, and yet so much sweetness that the soul still desires. God is
a delicious good. That which is the chief good must ravish the soul with
pleasure; there must be in it rapturous delight and quintessence of joy.
In Deo quadam dulcedine delectatur anima immo rapitur: the love of God
drops such infinite suavity into the soul as is unspeakable and full of
glory. If there be so much delight in God, when we see him only by faith
([Pe1 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#008).md), what will the joy of
vision be, when we shall see him face to face! If the saints have found
so much delight in God while they were suffering, oh, what joy and
delight will they have when they are being crowned! If flames are beds
of roses, what will it be to lean on the bosom of Jesus! What a bed of
roses that will be! God is a superlative good. He is better than
anything you can put in competition with him; he is better than health,
riches, honour. Other things maintain life, he gives life. Who would put
anything in balance with Deity? Who would weigh a feather against a
mountain of gold? God excels all other things more infinitely than the
sun the light of a taper. God is an eternal good. He is the Ancient of
days, yet never decays, nor waxes old. [Dan
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009.md). The joy he gives is eternal, the
crown fadeth not away. [Pe1 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004.md). The
glorified soul shall be ever solacing itself in God, feasting on his
love, and sunning itself in the light of his countenance. We read of the
river of pleasure at God's right hand; but will not this in time be
dried up? No. There is a fountain at the bottom which feeds it. [Psa
36:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#009.md). "With the Lord is a fountain of
life." Thus God is the chief good, and the enjoyment of God for ever is
the highest felicity of which the soul is capable. - Thomas Watson.

[Psa 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015.md)

"When I awake," etc. The sincere Christian is progressive, never at his
journey's end till he gets to heaven; this keeps him always in motion,
advancing in his desires and endeavours forward: he is thankful for
little grace, but not content with great measures of grace. "When I
awake," saith David, "I shall be satisfied with thy likeness." He had
many a sweet entertainment at the house of God in his ordinances. The
Spirit of God was the messenger that brought him many a covered dish
from God's table, inward consolations which the world knew not of. Yet
David has not enough, it is heaven alone that can give him his full
draught. They say the Gauls, when they first tasted of the wines of
Italy, were so taken with their lusciousness and sweetness, that they
could not be content to trade thither for this wine, but resolved they
would conquer the land where they grew. Thus the sincere soul thinks it
not enough to receive a little now and then of grace and comfort from
heaven, by trading and holding commerce at a distance with God in his
ordinances here below, but projects and meditates a conquest of that
holy land and blessed place from which such rich commodities come, that
he may drink the wine of that kingdom in that kingdom. - William
Gurnall.

[Psa 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015.md)

"When I awake." How apt and obvious is the analogy between our awaking
out of natural sleep, and the holy soul's rising up out of the darkness
and torpor of its present state into the enlivening light of God's
presence? It is truly said so to awake at its first quitting these
darksome regions, when it lays aside its cumbersome night-veil. It doth
so more perfectly in the joyful morning of the resurrection-day when
mortality is swallowed up in life, and all the yet hovering shadows of
it are vanished and fled away. And how known and usual an application
this is of the metaphorical terms of sleeping and awaking in Holy Writ,
I need not tell them who have read the Bible. Nor doth this
interpretation less fitly accord to the other contents of this verse;
for to what state do the sight of God's face, and satisfaction with his
likeness, so fully agree, as to that of future blessedness in the other
world? But then the contexture of discourse in this and the foregoing
verse together, seems plainly to determine us to this sense: for what
can be more conspicuous in them, than a purposed comparison, an
opposition of two states of felicity mutually to each other? That of the
wicked whom he calls men of time (as the wordsטהלד ממהיט are rendered by
Pagninus - Homines de tempore - and do literally signify) and whose
portion, he tells us, is in this life: and the righteous man's, his own;
which he expected not to be till he should awake, that is, not till
after his life. - John Howe.

[Psa 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015.md)

There is a sleep of deadness of spirit, out of which the shining of
God's loving countenance doth awake a believer and revive the spirit of
the contrite ones; and there is a sleep of death bodily, out of which
the lovingkindness of the Lord shall awake all his own in the day of the
resurrection, when he shall so change them into the similitude of his
own holiness and glorious felicity that they shall be fully contented
for ever: and this first and second delivery out of all trouble may
every believer expect and promise to himself. "I shall be satisfied when
I awake with thy likeness." - David Dickson.

[Psa 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015.md)

There is a threefold meaning in this verse, inasmuch as it is in Christ
alone, the firstborn from the dead, the express image of Jehovah's
glory, that the saints will rise immortal, incorruptible, and be like
the angels in heaven. 1. They will greatly delight in the glorious state
in which they will rise. 2. They will greatly delight in Jesus, in whom,
and by whom, resurrection and immortality are brought to light; and 3.
They will delight greatly in beholding the blessed and reconciled
countenance of Jehovah, the Father, whom no eye of flesh can see. This
is the difference between the appearance of God to Israel on Mount
Sinai, and the happy state in which the saints will behold him in the
resurrection. Glorious as the scene on Sinai was, yet the Lord said to
Israel. "You have seen no תּמוּגה(Temunah), no manner of similitude," or
likeness, or countenance; but David speaks of the spiritual glory of the
triumphant saints in the resurrection, when they shall see Jehovah as he
is, and rejoice in his beatific presence for ever and ever. - Benjamin
Weiss, in loc, 1858.

[Psa 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015.md)

Everlasting life and salvation in heaven, is not a truth revealed only
by the gospel, but was well known, clearly revealed, and firmly
believed, by the saints of old. They had assurance of this, that they
should live with God for ever in glory. "When I awake, with thy
likeness." [Psa 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015.md). "Thou wilt
receive me to glory." [Psa 73:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#024.md). "In
thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures
for evermore." [Psa 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011.md). They looked
for another country, whereof Canaan was but a type and shadow, as the
apostle shows in [Heb 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#016.md). They knew
there was an eternal state of happiness for the saints, as well as an
eternal state of misery for the wicked; they did believe this in those
days. - Samuel Mather on the "Types," 1705.

[Psalms 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 17:1</span></span>

1 Hear the right, O Lord attend unto my unto my cry, give ear unto my
prayer that goeth not out of reigned lips.

2 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold
the things that are equal.

3 Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou
hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall
not transgress.

4 Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me
from the paths of the destroyer.

[Psa 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001.md)

"Hear the right, O Lord." He that has the worst cause makes the most
noise; hence the oppressed soul is apprehensive that its voice may be
drowned, and therefore pleads in this one verse for a hearing no less
than three times. The troubled heart craves for the ear of the great
Judge, persuaded that with him to hear is to redress if our God could
not or would not hear us, our state would be deplorable indeed; and yet
some professors set such small store by the mercy-seat, that God does
not hear them for the simple reason that they neglect to plead. As well
have no house if we persist like gypsies in living in the lanes and
commons; as well have no mercy-seat as be always defending our own cause
and never going to God. There is more fear that we will not hear the
Lord than that the Lord will not hear us. "Hear the right;" it is well
if our case is good in itself and can be urged as a right one, for right
shall never be wronged by our righteous Judge; but if our suit be marred
by our infirmities, it is a great privilege that we may make mention of
the righteousness of our Lord Jesus, which is ever prevalent on high.
Right has a voice which Jehovah always hears; and if my wrongs clamour
against me with great force and fury, I will pray the Lord to hear that
still louder and mightier voice of the right, and the rights of his dear
Son. "Hear, O God, the just One;" i.e., "hear the Messiah," is a
rendering adopted by Jerome, and admired by Bishop Horsley, whether
correct or not as a translation, it is proper enough as a plea. Let the
reader plead it at the throne of the righteous God, even when all other
arguments are unavailing.

"Attend unto my cry." This shows the vehemence and earnestness of the
petitioner; he is no mere talker, he weeps and laments. Who can resist a
cry? A real hearty, bitter, piteous cry, might almost melt a rock, there
can be no fear of its prevalence with our heavenly Father. A cry is our
earliest utterance, and in many ways the most natural of human sounds;
if our prayer should like the infant's cry be more natural than
intelligent, and more earnest than elegant, it will be none the less
eloquent with God. There is a mighty power in a child's cry to prevail
with a parent's heart. "Give ear unto my prayer." Some repetitions are
not vain. The reduplication here used is neither superstition nor
tautology, but is like the repeated blow of a hammer hitting the same
nail on the head to fix it the more effectually, or the continued
knocking of a beggar at the gate who cannot be denied an alms. "That
goeth not out of feigned lips." Sincerity is a sine qu non in prayer.
Lips of deceit are detestable to man and much more to God. In
intercourse so hallowed as that of prayer, hypocrisy even in the
remotest degree is as fatal as it is foolish. Hypocritical piety is
double iniquity. He who would feign and flatter had better try his craft
with a fool like himself, for to deceive the all-seeing One is as
impossible as to take the moon in a net, or to lead the sun into a
snare. He who would deceive God is himself already most grossly
deceived. Our sincerity in prayer has no merit in it, any more than the
earnestness of a mendicant in the street; but at the same time the Lord
has regard to it, through Jesus, and will not long refuse his ear to an
honest and fervent petitioner.

[Psa 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#002.md)

"Let my sentence come forth from thy presence." The Psalmist has now
grown bold by the strengthening influence of prayer, and he now entreats
the Judge of all the earth to give sentence upon his case. He had been
libelled, basely and maliciously libelled; and having brought his action
before the highest court, he, like an innocent man, has no desire to
escape the enquiry, but even invites and sues for judgment. He does not
ask for secrecy, but would have the result come forth to the world. He
would have sentence pronounced and executed forthwith. In some matters
we may venture to be as bold as this; but except we can plead something
better than our own supposed innocence, it were terrible presumption
thus to challenge the judgment of a sin-hating God. With Jesus as our
complete and all-glorious righteousness we need not fear, though the day
of judgment should commence at once, and hell open her mouth at our
feet, but might joyfully prove the truth of our hymn writer's holy boast
-

"Bold shall I stand in that great day;

For who ought to my charge shall lay?

While, through thy blood, absolved I am

From sin's tremendous curse and shame."

"Let thine eyes behold the things that are equal." Believers do not
desire any other judge than God, or to be excused from judgment, or even
to be judged on principles of partiality. No; our hope does not lie in
the prospect of favouritism from God, and the consequent suspension of
his law; we expect to be judged on the same principles as other men, and
through the blood and righteousness of our Redeemer we shall pass the
ordeal unscathed. The Lord will weigh us in the scales of justice fairly
and justly; he will not use false weights to permit us to escape, but
with the sternest equity those balances will be used upon us as well as
upon others; and with our blessed Lord Jesus as our all in all we
tremble not, for we shall not be found wanting. In David's case, he felt
his cause to be so right that he simply desired the Divine eyes to rest
upon the matter, and he was confident that equity would give him all
that he needed.

[Psa 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#003.md)

"Thou hast proved mine heart." Like Peter, David uses the argument,
"Thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee." It is a most
assuring thing to be able to appeal at once to the Lord, and call upon
our Judge to be a witness for our defence. "Beloved, if our heart
condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God." "Thou hast visited
me in the night." As if he had said, "Lord, thou hast entered my house
at all hours; and thou hast seen me when no one else was nigh; thou hast
come upon me unawares and marked my unrestrained actions, and thou
knowest whether or no I am guilty of the crimes laid at my door." Happy
man who can thus remember the omniscient eye, and the omnipresent
visitor, and find comfort in the remembrance. We hope we have had our
midnight visits from our Lord, and truly they are sweet; so sweet that
the recollection of them sets us longing for more of such condescending
communings. Lord, if, indeed, we had been hypocrites, should we have had
such fellowship, or feel such hungerings after a renewal of it? "Thou
hast tried me, and shalt find nothing." Surely the Psalmist means
nothing hypocritical or wicked in the sense in which his slanderers
accused him; for if the Lord should put the best of his people into the
crucible, the dross would be a fearful sight, and would make penitence
open her sluices wide. Assayers very soon detect the presence of alloy,
and when the chief of all assayers shall, at the last, say of us that he
has found nothing, it will be a glorious hour indeed - "They are without
fault before the throne of God." Even here, as viewed in our covenant
Head, the Lord sees no sin in Jacob, nor perverseness in Israel; even
the all-detecting glance of Omniscience can see no flaw where the great
Substitute covers all with beauty and perfection. "I am purposed that my
mouth shall not transgress." Oh those sad lips of ours! we had need
purpose to purpose if we would keep them from exceeding their bounds.
The number of diseases of the tongue is as many as the diseases of all
the rest of the man put together, and they are more inveterate. Hands
and feet one may bind, but who can fetter the lips? iron bands may hold
a madman, but what chains can restrain the tongue? It needs more than a
purpose to keep this nimble offender within its proper range.
Lion-taming and serpent-charming are not to be mentioned in the same day
as tongue-taming, for the tongue can no man tame. Those who have to
smart from the falsehoods of others should be the more jealous over
themselves; perhaps this led the Psalmist to register this holy
resolution; and, moreover, he intended thereby to aver that if he had
said too much in his own defence, it was not intentional, for he desired
in all respects to tune his lips to the sweet and simple music of truth.
Nothwithstanding all this David was slandered, as if to show us that the
purest innocence will be bemired by malice. There is no sunshine without
a shadow, no ripe fruit unpecked by the birds.

[Psa 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#004.md)

"Concerning the works of men." While we are in the midst of men we shall
have their works thrust under our notice, and we shall be compelled to
keep a corner in our diary headed "concerning the works of men." To be
quite clear from the dead works of carnal humanity is the devout desire
of souls who are quickened by the Holy Spirit. "By the word of thy lips
I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer." He had kept the highway
of Scripture, and not chosen the bye-paths of malice. We should soon
imitate the example of the worst of men if the grace of God did not use
the Word of God as the great preservative from evil. The paths of the
destroyer have often tempted us; we have been prompted to become
destroyers too, when we have been sorely provoked, and resentment has
grown warm; but we have remembered the example of our Lord, who would
not call fire from heaven upon his enemies, but meekly prayed, "Father,
forgive them." All the ways of sin are the paths of Satan, - the
Apollyon or Abaddon, both of which words signify the destroyer. Foolish
indeed are those who give their hearts to the old murderer, because for
the time he panders to their evil desires. That heavenly Book which lies
neglected on many a shelf is the only guide for those who would avoid
the enticing and entangling mazes of sin; and it is the best means of
preserving the youthful pilgrim from ever treading those dangerous ways.
We must follow the one or the other; the Book of Life, or the way of
death; the word of the Holy Spirit, or the suggestion of the Evil
Spirit. David could urge as the proof of his sincerity that he had no
part or lot with the ungodly in their ruinous ways. How can we venture
to plead our cause with God, unless we also can wash our hands clean of
all connection with the enemies of the Great King?

[Psalms 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 17:5</span></span>

5 Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.

6 I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine
ear unto me, and hear my speech.

[Psa 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#005.md)

Under trial it is not easy to behave ourselves aright; a candle is not
easily kept alight when many envious mouths are puffing at it. In evil
times prayer is peculiarly needful, and wise men resort to it at once.
Plato said to one of his disciples, "When men speak ill of thee, live so
that no one will believe them;" good enough advice, but he did not tell
us how to carry it out. We have a precept here incorporated in an
example; if we would be preserved, we must cry to the Preserver, and
enlist divine support upon our side. "Hold up my goings" - as a careful
driver holds up his horse when going down hill. We have all sorts of
paces, both fast and slow, and the road is never long of one sort, but
with God to hold up our goings, nothing in the pace or in the road can
cast down. He who has been down once and cut his knees sadly, even to
the bone, had need redouble his zeal when using this prayer; and all of
us, since we are so weak on our legs through Adam's fall, had need use
it every hour of the day. If a perfect father fell, how shall an
imperfect son dare to boast? "In thy paths." Forsaking Satan's paths, he
prayed to be upheld in God's paths. We cannot keep from evil without
keeping to good. If the bushel be not full of wheat, it may soon be once
more full of chaff. In all the appointed ordinances and duties of our
most holy faith, may the Lord enable us to run through his upholding
grace! "That my footsteps slip not." What I slip in God's ways? Yes, the
road is good, but our feet are evil, and therefore slip, even on the
King's highway. Who wonders if carnal men slide and fall in ways of
their own choosing, which, like the vale of Siddirn, are full of deadly
slime-pits? One may trip over an ordinance as well as over a temptation.
Jesus Christ himself is a stumbling-block to some, and the doctrines of
grace have been the occasion of offence to many. Grace alone can hold up
our goings in the paths of truth.

[Psa 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#006.md)

"1 have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God." Thou hast
always heard me, O my Lord, and therefore I have the utmost confidence
in again approaching thine altar. Experience is a blessed teacher. He
who has tried the faithfulness of God in hours of need, has great
boldness in laying his case before the throne. The well of Bethlehem,
from which we drew such cooling draughts in years gone by, our souls
long for still; nor will we leave it for the broken cisterns of earth.
"Incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech." Stoop out of heaven and
put thine ear to my mouth; give me thine ear all to myself, as men do
when they lean over to catch every word from their friend. The Psalmist
here comes back to his first prayer, and thus sets us an example of
pressing our suit again and again, until we have a full assurance that
we have succeeded.

[Psalms 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 17:7</span></span>

7 Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right
hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against
them.

8 Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy
wings.

9 From the wicked that oppress me from my deadly enemies, who compass me
about.

10 They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak
proudly.

11 They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes
bowing down to the earth;

12 Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young
lion lurking in secret places.

[Psa 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#007.md)

"Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness." Marvellous in its antiquity, its
distinguishing character, its faithfulness, its immutability, and above
all, marvellous in the wonders which it works. That marvellous grace
which has redeemed us with the precious blood of God's only begotten, is
here invoked to come to the rescue. That grace is sometimes hidden; the
text says, "Shew it." Present enjoyments of divine love are matchless
cordials to support fainting hearts. Believer, what a prayer is this!
Consider it well. O Lord, shew thy marvellous lovingkindness; shew it to
my intellect, and remove my ignorance; shew it to my heart, and revive
my gratitude; shew it to my faith, and renew my confidence; shew it to
my experience, and deliver me from all my fears. The original word here
used is the same which in [Psa 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#003.md) is
rendered set apart, and it has the force of, Distinguish thy mercies,
set them out, and set apart the choicest to be bestowed upon me in this
hour of my severest affliction. "O thou that savest by thy right hand
them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against
them." The title here given to our gracious God is eminently
consolatory. He is the God of salvation; it is his present and perpetual
habit to save believers; he puts forth his best and most glorious
strength, using his right hand of wisdom and might, to save all those,
of whatsoever rank or class, who trust themselves with him. Happy faith
thus to secure the omnipotent protection of heaven! Blessed God, to be
thus gracious to unworthy mortals, when they have but grace to rely upon
thee! The right hand of God is interposed between the saints and all
harm; God is never at a loss for means; his own bare hand is enough. He
works without tools as well as with them.

[Psa 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#008.md)

"Keep me as the apple of the eye." No part of the body more precious,
more tender, and more carefully guarded than the eye; and of the eye, no
portion more peculiarly to be protected than the central apple, the
pupil, or, as the Hebrew calls it, "the daughter of the eye." The
all-wise Creator has placed the eye in a well-protected position; it
stand surrounded by projecting bones like Jerusalem encircled by
mountains. Moreover, its great Author has surrounded it with many tunics
of inward covering, besides the hedge of the eyebrows, the curtain of
the eyelids, and the fence of the eyelashes; and, in addition to this,
he has given to every man so high a value for his eyes, and so quick an
apprehension of danger, that no member of the body is more faithfully
cared for than the organ of sight. Thus, Lord, keep thou me, for I trust
I am one with Jesus, and so a member of his mystical body. "Hide me
under the shadow of thy wings." Even as the parent bird completely
shields her brood from evil, and meanwhile cherishes them with the
warmth of her own heart, by covering them with her wings, so do thou
with me, most condescending God, for I am thine offspring, and thou hast
a parent's love in perfection. This last clause is in the Hebrew in the
future tense, as if to show that what the writer had asked for but a
moment before he was now sure would be granted to him. Confident
expectation should keep pace with earnest supplication.

[Psa 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#009.md)

"From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who compass me
about." The foes from whom David sought to be rescued were wicked men.
It is hopeful for us when our enemies are God's enemies. They were
deadly enemies, whom nothing but his death would satisfy. The foes of a
believer's soul are mortal foes most emphatically, for they who war
against our faith aim at the very life of our life. Deadly sins are
deadly enemies, and what sin is there which hath not death in its
bowels? These foes oppressed David, they laid his spirit waste, as
invading armies ravage a country, or as wild beasts desolate a land. He
likens himself to a besieged city, and complains that his foes compass
him about. It may well quicken our business upward, when all around us,
every road, is blockaded by deadly foes. This is our daily position, for
all around us dangers and sins are lurking. O God, do thou protect us
from them all.

[Psa 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#010.md)

"They are inclosed in their own fat." Luxury and gluttony beget
vainglorious fatness of heart, which shuts up its gates against all
compassionate emotions and reasonable judgments. The old proverb says
that full bellies make empty skulls, and it is yet more true that they
frequently make empty hearts. The rankest weeds grow out of the fattest
soil. Riches and self-indulgence are the fuel upon which some sins feed
their flames. Pride and fulness of bread were Sodom's twin sins. ([Eze
16:49](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#049)..md) Fed hawks forget their
masters; and the moon at its fullest is furthest from the sun. Eglon was
a notable instance that a well-fed corporation is no security to life,
when a sharp message comes from God, addressed to the inward vitals of
the body. "With their mouth they speak proudly." He who adores himself
will have no heart to adore the Lord. Full of selfish pleasure within
his heart, the wicked man fills his mouth with boastful and arrogant
expressions. Prosperity and vanity often lodge together. Woe to the fed
ox when it bellows at its owner, the pole axe is not far off.

[Psa 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#011.md)

"They have now compassed us in our steps." The fury of the ungodly is
aimed not at one believer alone, but at all the band; they have
compassed us. All the race of the Jews were but a morsel for Haman's
hungry revenge, and all because of one Mordecai. The prince of darkness
hates all the saints for their Master's sake. The Lord Jesus is one of
the us, and herein is our hope. He is the Breaker, and will clear a way
for us through the hosts which environ us. The hatred of the powers of
evil is continuous and energetic, for they watch every step, hoping that
the time may come when they shall catch us by surprise. If our spiritual
adversaries thus compass every step, how anxiously should we guard all
our movements, lest by any means we should be betrayed into evil! "They
have set their eyes bowing down to the earth." Trapp wittily explains
this metaphor by an allusion to a bull when about to run at his victim;
he lowers his head, looks downward, and then concentrates all his force
in the dash which he makes. It most probably denotes the malicious
jealousy with which the enemy watches the steps of the righteous; as if
they studied the ground on which they trod, and searched after some
wrong footmark to accuse them for the past, or some stumbling-stone to
cast in their future path to trip them in days to come.

[Psa 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#012.md)

Lions are not more greedy, nor their ways more cunning than are Satan
and his helpers when engaged against the children of God. The blood of
souls the adversary thirsts after, and all his strength and craft are
exercised to the utmost to satisfy his detestable appetite. We are weak
and foolish like sheep; but we have a shepherd wise and strong, who
knows the old lion's wiles, and is more than a match for his force:
therefore will we not fear but rest in safety in the fold. Let us
beware, however, of our lurking foe; and in those parts of the road were
we feel most secure, let us look about us lest, peradventure, our foe
should leap upon us.

[Psalms 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 17:13</span></span>

13 Arise, O Lord, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from
the wicked, which is thy sword:

14 From men which are thy hand, O Lord, from men of the world, which
have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy
hid treasure: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their
substance to their babes.

[Psa 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#013.md)

"Arise, O Lord." The more furious the attack, the more fervent the
Psalmist's prayer. His eye rests singly upon the Almighty, and he feels
that God has but to rise from the seat of his patience and the work will
be performed at once. Let the lion spring upon us, if Jehovah steps
between we need no better defence. When God meets our foe face to face
in battle, the conflict will soon be over. "Disappoint him." Be
beforehand with him, outwit and outrun him. Appoint it otherwise than he
has appointed and so disappoint him. "Cast him down." Prostrate him.
Make him sink upon his knees. Make him bow as the conquered bows before
the conqueror. What a glorious sight will it be to behold Satan
prostrate beneath the foot of our glorious Lord! Haste, glorious day!
"Deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy sword." He recognizes the
most profane and oppressive as being under the providential rule of the
King of kings, and used as a sword in the divine hand. What can a sword
do unless it be wielded by a hand? No more could the wicked annoy us,
unless the Lord permitted them so to do. Most translators are, however,
agreed that this is not the correct reading, but that it should be as
Calvin puts it, "Deliver my soul from the ungodly man by thy sword."
Thus David contrasts the sword of the Lord with human aids and reliefs,
and rests assured that he is safe enough under the patronage of heaven.

[Psa 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014.md)

Almost every word of this verse has furnished matter for discussion to
scholars, for it is very obscure. We will, therefore, rest content with
the common version, rather than distract the reader with divers
translations. "From men which are thy hand." Having styled the ungodly a
sword in his Father's hand, he now likens them to that hand itself, to
set forth his conviction that God could as easily remove their violence
as a man moves his own hand. He will never slay his child with his own
hand. "From men of the world," mere earthworms; not men of the world to
come, but mere dwellers in this narrow sphere of mortality; having no
hopes or wishes beyond the ground on which they tread. "Which have their
portion in this life." Like the prodigal, they have their portion, and
are not content to wait their Father's time. Like Passion in the
"Pilgrim's Progress," they have their best things first, and revel
during their little hour. Luther was always afraid lest he should have
his portion here, and therefore frequently gave away sums of money which
had been presented to him. We cannot have earth and heaven too for our
choice and portion; wise men choose that which will last the longest.
"Whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure." Their sensual appetite
gets the gain which it craved for. God gives to these swine the husks
which they hunger for. A generous man does not deny dogs their bones;
and our generous God gives even his enemies enough to fill them, if they
were not so unreasonable as never to be content. Gold and silver which
are locked up in the dark treasuries of the earth are given to the
wicked liberally, and they therefore roll in all manner of carnal
delights. Every dog has his day, and they have theirs, and a bright
summer's day it seems; but ah! how soon it ends in night! "They are full
of children." This was their fondest hope, that a race from their loins
would prolong their names far down the page of history, and God has
granted them this also; so that they have all that heart can wish. What
enviable creatures they seem, but it is only seeming! "They are full of
children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes." They
were fat housekeepers, and yet leave no lean wills. Living and dying
they lacked for nothing but grace, and alas! that lack spoils
everything. They had a fair portion within the little circle of time,
but eternity entered not into their calculations. They were penny wise,
but pound foolish; they remembered the present, and forgot the future;
they fought for the shell, and lost the kernel, How fine a description
have we here of many a successful merchant, or popular statesman; and it
is, at first sight, very showy and tempting but in contrast with the
glories of the world to come, what are these paltry molehill Joys. Self,
self, self, all these joys begin and end in basest selfishness; but oh,
our God, how rich are those who begin and end in thee! From all the
contamination and injury which association with worldly men is sure to
bring us, deliver thou us, O God!

[Psalms 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 17:15</span></span>

15 As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness. I shall be
satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.

"As for me." "I neither envy nor covet these men's happiness, but partly
have and partly hope for a far better." To behold God's face and to be
changed by that vision into his image, so as to partake in his
righteousness, this is my noble ambition; and in the prospect of this I
cheerfully waive all my present enjoyments. My satisfaction is to come;
I do not look for it as yet. I shall sleep awhile, but I shall wake at
the sound of the trumpet; wake to everlasting joy, because I arise in
thy likeness, O my God and King! Glimpses of glory good men have here
below to stay their sacred hunger, but the full feast awaits them in the
upper skies. Compared with this deep, ineffable, eternal fulness of
delight, the joys of the worldling are as a glowworm to the sun, or the
drop of a bucket to the ocean.
