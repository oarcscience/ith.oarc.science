[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 131:0</span></span>

Title. - A Song of Degrees of David. It is both by David and of David'
he is the author and the subject of it, and many incidents of his life
may be employed to illustrate it. Comparing all the Psalms to gems, we
should liken this to a pearl' how beautifully it will adorn the neck of
patience. It is one of the shortest Psalms to read, but one of the
longest to learn. It speaks of a young child, but it contains the
experience of a man in Christ. Lowliness and humility are here seen in
connection with a sanctified heart, a will subdued to the mind of God,
and a hope looking to the Lord alone. Happy is the man who can without
falsehood use these words as his own; for he wears about him the
likeness of his Lord, who said, "I am meek and lowly in heart." The
Psalm is in advance of all the Songs of Degrees which have preceded it;
for lowliness is one of the highest attainments in the divine life.
There are also steps in this Song of Degrees it is a short ladder, if we
count the words; but yet it rises to a great height, reaching from deep
humility to fixed confidence. Le Blanc thinks that this is a song of the
Israelites who returned from Babylon with humbled hearts, weaned from
their idols. At any rate, after any spiritual captivity let it be the
expression of our hearts.

Hints to Preachers

[Psa 131:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001.md). - Humility.

I. A profession which ought to befit every child of God.

II\. A profession which nevertheless many children of God cannot
truthfully make. Point out the prevalence of pride and ambition even in
the church.

III\. A profession which can only be justified through the possession of
the spirit of Christ ([Mat 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029.md), [Mat
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#030.md); [Mat
18:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#001).md). - C. A. D.

[Psa 131:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#002.md). - The soul is as a weaned
child:

I. In conversion.

II\. In sanctification, which is a continual weaning from the world and
sin.

III\. In bereavement.

IV\. In affliction of every kind.

V. In death. - G. R.

[Psa 131:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#002.md). -

I. The soul has to be weaned as well as the body.

1\. It is first nourished by others.

2\. It is afterwards thrown upon its own resources.

II\. The soul is weaned from one thing by giving its attention to
another.

1\. From worldly things by heavenly.

2\. From self-righteousness by the righteousness of another.

3\. From sin to holiness.

4\. From the world to Christ.

5\. From self to God. - G. R.

[Psa 131:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#002.md). -

I. A desirable condition: "As a weaned child."

II\. A difficult task - to subdue and quiet self.

III\. A delightful result: "Surely my soul is as a weaned child." - W.
H. J. P.

[Psa 131:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#002.md). -

I. Soul-fretfulness: weak, dishonourable, rebellious.

II\. Soul-government; throne often abdicated; God gives each the sceptre
of self-rule; necessary to successful life.

III\. Soul-quiet; its sweetness; its power. Come, Holy Spirit, breathe
it upon us! - W. B. H.

[Psa 131:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#002.md). - See "Spurgeon's
Sermons," No. 1,210: "The Weaned Child."

[Psa 131:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#002.md), [Psa
131:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#003.md). - The weaned child hoping in
the Lord:

I. The first weaning of the soul, the grand event of a man's history.

II\. The joy in the Lord that springs up in every weaned soul: "My soul
is even as a weaned child; let Israel hope In the Lord from henceforth
and for ever."

III\. The daily meaning of the soul through life.

IV\. The earnest desires and the fruitful work of every weaned soul. -
A. Moody Stuart.

[Psa 131:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#003.md). -

I. The encouragement to hope in God.

1\. As a covenant God, "the God of Israel."

2\. As a covenant-keeping God: "From henceforth," etc.

II\. The effect of this hope.

1\. The humility and dependence in [Psa
131:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001.md).

2\. The contentment and weaning in [Psa
131:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#002.md). Would Israel be thus humble and
obedient as a little child? "Let Israel hope," etc. - G. R.

[Psa 131:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#003.md). - The Voice of Hope heard
in the Calm.

I. Calmed souls appreciate God. Quiet favours contemplation. God's
majesty, perfection, and praise so discovered.

II\. Calmed souls confide in God; seen to be so worthy of trust.

III\. Calmed souls look fearlessly into eternity; "from henceforth and
for ever." - W. B. H.

[Psa 131:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#003.md). - Hope on, hope ever.

I. For the past warrants such confidence.

II\. For the present demands such confidence.

III\. For the future will justify such confidence. - W. H. J. P.

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Whole Psalm

This little song is inscribed לדוד because it is like an echo of the
answer ([Sa2 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#021) sq..md) with which
David repelled the mocking observation of Michal when he danced before
the Ark in a linen ephod, and therefore not in kingly attire, but in the
common raiment of the priests. I esteem myself still less than I now
show it, and I appear base in mine own eyes. In general David is the
model of the state of mind which the poet expresses here. He did not
push himself forward, but suffered himself to be drawn forth out of
seclusion. He did not take possession of the throne violently; but after
Samuel has anointed him, he willingly and patiently traverses the long,
thorny, circuitous way of deep abasement, until he receives from God's
hand that which God's promise had assured to him. The persecution by
Saul lasted about ten years, and his kingship in Hebron, at first only
incipient, seven years and a half. He left it entirely to God to remove
Saul and Ishbosheth. He let Shimei curse. He left Jerusalem before
Absalom. Submission to God's guidance, resignation to his dispensations,
contentment with that which was allotted to him, are the distinguishing
traits of his noble character. - Franz Delitzsch.

Whole Psalm

[Psa 130:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#001.md) is a Song of Forgiveness;
[Psa 131:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001.md) is a Song of Humility:
the former celebrates the blessedness of the man whose transgressions
are pardoned; the latter celebrates the blessedness of the man who is of
a meek and lowly spirit. Forgiveness should humble us. Forgiveness
implies sin; and should not the sinner clothe himself with humility? and
when not for any desert of his, but simply by the free grace of Heaven,
his sins have been pardoned, should he not bind the garments of humility
still more closely about him? The man who is of a nature at once sincere
and sweet, will be even more humbled by the sense of an undeserved
forgiveness than by the memory of the sins from which it has cleansed
him. Very fitly, therefore, does the Psalm of humility follow the Psalm
which sings of the Divine lovingkindness and tender mercy. - Samuel Cox.

Whole Psalm

This Psalm, which records the meek and humble spirit of those who are
the true worshippers of the Temple, doubtless belongs, as its title
announces, to the time of David. It is exactly in the spirit of that
humble thanksgiving made by him, after the divine revelation by Nathan
of the future blessings of his posterity ([Ch1
22:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#009).md); and forms a most appropriate
introduction to the following Psalm, the theme of which is evidently the
dedication of the Temple. - John Jebb.

[Psa 131:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001.md)

"Lord, my heart is not haughty." For the truth of his plea he appealeth
to God.; and from all those who are affected like David, God will accept
of the appeal.

Firstly. He could in truth of heart appeal to God, "Lord, my heart is
not haughty." He appealeth to him who knoweth all things. "Lord, from
whom nothing is hid, thou knowest that this is the very disposition of
my soul. If I have anything, it is from thee; it is thy providence which
brought me from following the ewes great with young to feed and govern
thy people." Such a holy man would not rashly invoke God, and take his
holy name in vain; but knowing his integrity, durst call God to witness.
The saints are wont to do so upon like occasions; as Peter ([Joh
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#017).md); "Lord, thou knowest all
things; thou knowest that I love thee." They know they have a God that
will not be deceived with any shows, and that he knoweth and approveth
them for such as he findeth them to be.

Secondly. From those that are affected like David, God will accept the
appeal; for in the account of God we are that which we sincerely desire
and endeavour to be, and that which is the general course and tenor of
our lives, though there be some intermixture of failing. David saith,
"Lord, my heart is not haughty"; and yet he was not altogether free from
pride. His profession respecteth his sincere purpose and constant
endeavour, and the predominant disposition of his soul. God himself
confirmeth such appeals by his own testimony, [Kg1
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#005.md), "My servant David did that which
was right in the eyes of the Lord, neither departed from all that which
he had commanded him, save only in the matter of Uriah".... By all this
it is shown that the plea of sincerity is allowed by God, though there
be some mixture of failings and weaknesses.

Thirdly. Is not this boasting like the Pharisee? [Luk
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#009.md), "God, I thank thee, I am not
like other men." If David were thus humble, why doth he speak of it? Is
he not guilty of pride while he seemeth to speak against pride?

This is spoken either as, (1) A necessary vindication; or (2) A
necessary instruction.

I. As a necessary vindication against the censures and calumnies of his
adversaries. Saul's courtiers accused him as aspiring after the kingdom;
yea, his own brother taxed him with pride when he came first abroad,
[Sa1 17:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#028.md), "I know thy pride, and the
naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest
see the battle." If his brother would calumniate his actions, much more
might others. Now it is for the honour of God that his children, as they
would not commit a fault, so they should not be under the suspicion of
it; therefore he appealeth to God.

II\. A necessary instruction; for whatsoever David said or wrote here,
he said or wrote by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, that Israel may
learn how to hope in God. Herein David is a notable pattern of duty both
to superiors and inferiors. - Thomas Manton.

[Psa 131:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001.md)

"My heart is not haughty." Albeit pride is a common vice, which
attendeth vain man in every degree of excellency and supposed worth in
him, yet the grace of God is able to keep humble a wise, rich, and
potent man, yea, to keep humble a king and conqueror; for it is no less
a person than David who saith here, "Lord, my heart is not haughty." -
David Dickson.

[Psa 131:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001.md)

"Nor mine eyes lofty." Pride has its seat in the heart; but its
principal expression is in the eye. The eye is the mirror of the soul;
and from it mental and moral characteristics may be ascertained, with no
small degree of precision. What a world of meaning is sometimes
concentrated in a single glance! But of all the passions, pride is most
clearly revealed in the eyes. There can scarcely be a mistake here. We
are all familiar with a class of phrases, which run in pairs. Vie speak
of sin and misery; holiness and happiness; peace and prosperity; war and
desolation. Among these may be numbered, the proud heart and the haughty
look. "There is a generation, Oh, how lofty are their eyes! and their
eyelids are lifted up." "Him that hath an high look and a proud heart I
will not suffer."... A proud look is one of the seven things which are
an abomination unto the Lord. It is said of him, "Thou wilt save the
afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks." And hence David makes
the acknowledgment: Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that
pride has no existence in my heart. Thou knowest that no pride flashes
forth from mine eyes. - N. M.'Michael.

[Psa 131:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001.md)

"Nor mine eyes lofty." He had neither a scornful nor an aspiring look.
"My eyes are not lofty," either to look with envy upon those that are
above me, or to look with disdain upon those that are below me. Where
there is a proud heart, there is commonly a proud look ([Pro
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#017).md); but the humble publican will
not so much as lift up his eyes. - Matthew Henry.

[Psa 131:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001.md)

"Neither have I occupied myself," etc. One cannot admire enough the
prayer of Anselm, a profound divine of our own country, in the eleventh
century. "I do not seek, O Lord, to penetrate thy depths. I by no means
think my intellect equal to them: but I long to understand in some
degree thy truth, which my heart believes and loves. For I do not seek
to understand that I may believe; but I believe, that I may understand."
- N. M.'Michael.

[Psa 131:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001.md)

"Great matters ... things too high for me." The great and wonderful
things meant are God's secret purposes, and sovereign means for their
accomplishment, in which man is not called to co-operate, but to
acquiesce. As David practised this forbearance by the patient
expectation of the kingdom, both before and after the death of Saul, so
he here describes it as a characteristic of the chosen people. - Joseph
Addison Alexander.

[Psa 131:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001.md), [Psa
131:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#002.md)

Our Father is our superior; it is fit therefore that we be resigned to
his will. "Honour thy father and thy mother" ([Exo
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#012).md); how much more our heavenly
Father! ([Heb 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#009).md). See David's
spirit in the case: "Lord, my heart is not haughty," etc., [Psa
131:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001.md), [Psa
131:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#002.md). As if he had said, "I will keep
within my own sphere; I will not stretch beyond my line, in prescribing
to God; but submit to his will, 'as a weaned child,' taken from its dear
breasts": intimating that he would wean himself from whatever God
removed from him. How patiently did Isaac permit himself to be bound and
sacrificed by Abraham! [Gen 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#009.md). And
yet he was of age and strength sufficient to have struggled for his
life, being twenty-five years old; but that holy young man abhorred the
thought of striving with his father. And shall not we resign ourselves
to our God and Father in Christ Jesus? - John Singleton ( - 1706), in
"The Morning Exercises."

[Psa 131:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001.md), [Psa
131:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#002.md)

It has always been my aim, and it is my prayer, to have no plan as
regards myself; well assured as I am that the place where the Saviour
sees meet to place me must ever be the best place for me. - Robert
Murray M'Cheyne, 1813-1843.

[Psa 131:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#002.md)

"Surely I have behaved and quieted myself," etc. Oh, how sapless and
insipid doth the world grow to the soul that is making meet for heaven I
"I am crucified to the world, and this world to me." [Gal
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#014.md). In vain doth this harlot think
to allure me by her attractions of profit and pleasure. "Surely I have
behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my
soul is even as a weaned child." There is no more relish in these gaudy
things to my palate, than in the white of an egg; everything grows a
burden to me, were it not my duty to follow my calling, and be thankful
for my enjoyments. Methinks I have my wife, husband, and dearest
relations, as if I had none; I weep for outward losses, as if I wept
not; rejoice in comforts below as if I rejoiced not ([Co1
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#029.md), [Co1
7:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#030).md); my thoughts are taken up with
other objects. The men of the world slight me, many seem to be weary of
me, and I am as weary of them. It is none of these earthly things that
my heart is set upon; my soul is set on things above, my treasure is in
heaven, and I would have my heart there also: I have sent before me all
my goods into another country, and am shortly for removing; and when I
look about me, I see a bare, empty house, and am ready to say with
Monica, What do I here? my father, husband, mother (Jerusalem above), my
brethren, sisters, best friends are above. Methinks, I grudge the world
any portion of my heart, and think not these temporal visible things
worth a cast of my eye compared with things invisible and eternal: [Co2
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#018.md). - Oliver Heywood, 1629-1702.

[Psa 131:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#002) (first clause.md)

"If I have not restrained," or quieted, and compelled to silence, "my
soul." It is a Hebrew phrase of asseveration and of swearing, as if he
would say, I have thoroughly imposed silence on my soul, that it should
be tranquil, and should bear patiently the divinely imposed cross. Just
as in the following Psalm we hear a like form of asseveration: "If I
will come into the tabernacle of my house," meaning "I will not come,"
etc. - Solomon Gesner.

[Psa 131:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#002.md)

"I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned." Weaned
from what? Self-sufficiency, self-will, self-seeking. From creatures and
the things of the world - not, indeed, as to their use, but as to any
dependence upon them for his happiness and portion.... Yet this
experience is no easy attainment. The very form of expression - "I have
behaved and quieted myself," reminds us of some risings which were with
difficulty subdued. There is a difference here between Christ and
Christians. In him the exercise of grace encountered no adverse
principles; but in them it meets with constant opposition. The flesh
lusteth against the spirit; and when we would do good, evil is present
with us; hence the warfare within. So it is with "the child that is
weaned." The task to the mother is trying and troublesome. The infant
cries, and seems to sob out his heart. He thinks it very hard in her,
and knows not what she means by her seeming cruelty, and the mother's
fondness renders all her firmness necessary to keep her at the process;
and sometimes she also weeps at the importunity of his dear looks, and
big tears, and stretched-out hands. But it must be done, and therefore,
though she pities, she perseveres; and after a while he is soothed and
satisfied, forgets the breast, and no longer feels even a hankering
after his former pleasure. But how is the weaning of the child
accomplished? By embittering the member to his lips; by the removal of
the object in the absence and concealment of the mother; by the
substitution of other food; by the influence of time. So it is with us.
We love the world, and it deceives us. We depend on creatures, and they
fail us, and pierce us through with many sorrows. We enter forbidden
paths, and follow after our lovers; and our way is hedged up with
thorns; and we then say, "Return unto thy rest, O my soul; and now,
Lord, what wait I for? My hope is in thee." The enjoyment of a greater
good subdues the relish of a less. What are the indulgences of sin, or
the dissipations of the world to one who is abundantly satisfied with
the goodness of God's house, and is made to drink of the river of his
pleasures? - William Jay (1769-1853), in "Evening Exercises for the
Closet."

[Psa 131:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#002.md)

"As a child that is weaned of his mother." Though the weaned child has
not what it would have, or what it naturally most desireth, the milk of
the breast - yet it is contented with what the mother giveth - it rests
upon her love and provision. So are we to be content with what
providence alloweth us: [Heb 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#005.md),
"Let your conversation be without covetousness, and be content with such
things as ye have"; and [Phi 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#011.md), "I
have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content."
Whatever pleaseth our heavenly Father should please us. The child that
is put from the breast to a harder diet is yet contented at last. The
child doth not prescribe what it will eat, drink or put on. Children are
in no care for enlarging possessions, heaping up riches, aspiring after
dignities and honours; but meekly take what is provided for them. The
child, when it has lost the food which nature provideth for it, is not
solicitous, but wholly referreth itself to the mother, hangeth upon the
mother. So for everything whatsoever should we depend upon God, refer
ourselves to God, and expect all things from him: [Psa
62:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#005.md), "My soul, wait thou only upon
God; for my expectation is from him." With such a simplicity of
submission should we rest and depend upon God. Let us take heed of being
over wise and provident for ourselves, but let us trust our Father which
is in heaven, and refer ourselves to his wise and holy government. -
Thomas Manton.

[Psa 131:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#002.md)

"As a child that is weaned of his mother." Weaned from the world, the
riches, honours, pleasures, and profits of it; as well as from nature,
from self, from his own righteousness, and all dependence upon it; and
as a child that is weaned from the breast wholly depends on its nurse
for sustenance, so did he wholly depend upon God, his providence, grace,
and strength; and as to the kingdom, he had no more covetous desires
after it than a weaned child has to the breast, and was very willing to
wait the due time for the enjoyment of it. The Targum has it, "as one
weaned on the breasts of its mother, I am strengthened in the law." This
is to be understood not of a child whilst weaning, when it is usually
peevish, fretful, and froward, but when it is weaned, and is quiet and
easy in its mother's arms without the breast. - John Gill.

[Psa 131:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#002.md)

"My soul is even as a weaned child." In its nature, weanedness of soul
differs essentially from that disgust with the world, to which its
ill-usage and meanness sometimes give rise. It is one thing to be angry
with the world, or ashamed of it, and another to be weaned from it.
Alter the world, ennoble it, and many a proud mind that now despises,
would court it. It is different also from that weariness of spirit which
generally follows a free indulgence in earthly enjoyments. There is such
a thing as wearing out the affections. Solomon appears to have done this
at one period of his life. "I have not a wish left," said a well-known
sensualist of our own country, who had drunk as deeply as he could drink
of the world's cup. "Were all the earth contains spread out before me, I
do not know a thing I would take the trouble of putting out my hand to
reach."

This weanedness of soul presupposes a power left in the soul of loving
and desiring. It is not the destruction of its appetite, but the
controlling and changing of it. A weaned child still hungers, but it
hungers no more after the food that once delighted it; it is quiet
without it; it can feed on other things: so a soul weaned from the
world, still pants as much as ever for food and happiness, but it no
longer seeks them in worldly things, or desires to do so. There is
nothing in the world that it feels necessary for its happiness. This
thing in it it loves, and that thing it values; but it knows that it can
do without them, and it is ready to do without them whenever God
pleases.

Let us inquire now into the sources of this frame of mind - how we get
it. One thing is certain - it is not our work. We do not bring ourselves
to it. No infant weans itself. The truth is, it is God that must wean us
from the world. We shall never leave it of our own accord. It is God's
own right hand that must draw us from it. And how? The figure in the
text will partly tell us.

I. By embittering the world to us.

II\. At other times the Lord removes from us the thing we lope.

III\. But he weans us most from the earth by giving us better food. -
Condensed from a Sermon by Charles Bradley, entitled "Weanedness of
Soul," 1836.

[Psa 131:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#002.md)

"As a weaned child." That is, meek, modest, humble, submissive, simple,
etc. See [Mat 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#001.md), [Mat
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#002.md), [Mat
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#003.md), [Mat
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#004.md). - Henry Ainsworth, -1622.

[Psa 131:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#002.md)

Here is David's picture of himself ... Observe, the "child" - which is
drawn for us to copy - is "weaned": the process is complete; it has been
truly disciplined; the lesson is learned; and now it rests in its
"weaning." The whole image expresses a repose which follows a struggle.
"Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of
his mother"; or, more literally, "on his mother"; now content to lie
still on the very place of its privation, - "as a child that is weaned
on his mother."

That obedience would be a tame and valueless thing, which was not the
consequence of quiet control. A mere apathetic state is the very
opposite of obedience that may be truly so called. But this is the point
of the similitude, - there has been a distress, and a battle, and a
self-victory; and now the stilled will is hushed into submission and
contentment; ready to forego what is most liked, and to take just
whatever is given it - "a weaned child."

I do not believe that it was ever the intention of God that any man
should so merge and lose his will in the Divine, that he should have no
distinct will of his own. There have been many who have tried to attain
this annihilation of will; and they have made it the great aim and end
of life. But the character of the dispensation does not allow it. I do
not believe it to be a possible thing; and if it were possible, I do not
believe that it would be after the mind of God. It is not man's present
relation to his Maker. None of the saints in the Bible did more than
submit a strong existing will. The Lord Jesus Christ himself did no
more. "What shall I say? Father, save me from this hour; but for this
cause came I unto this hour. Father, glorify thy name. Not my will, but
thine be done." Evidently two things - "My will, Thy will." It was an
instantly and perfectly subjugated will, - nevertheless, a will.

And this is what is required of us; and what the nature of our manhood,
and the provisions of our religion have to assume. A will, decidedly a
will: the more decided the will, the stronger the character, and the
greater the man. But a will that is always being given up, separated,
conformed, constantly, increasingly conformed. The unity of the two
wills is heaven. - Condensed from a Sermon by James Vaughan.

[Psa 131:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#003.md)

"Let Israel hope in the Lord." After the example, therefore, of the King
of Israel, who thus demeaned himself in his afflictions lowly contented,
and resigned casting all his care upon the Father who cared for him, and
patiently waiting his time for deliverance and salvation; after this
their example and pattern, let his faithful people hope and trust, not
in themselves, their wisdom, or their power, but in Jehovah alone, who
will not fail to exalt them, as he hath already exalted their Redeemer,
if they do but follow his steps. - George Horne.

[Psa 131:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#003.md)

"Let Israel hope in the Lord." Though David could himself wait patiently
and quietly for the crown designed him, yet perhaps Israel, the people
whose darling he was, would be ready to attempt something in favour of
him before the time; he therefore endeavours to quiet them too, and bids
them "hope in the Lord" that they should see a happy change of the face
of affairs in due time. Thus "it is good to hope, and quietly to wait
for the salvation of the Lord." - Matthew Henry.

[Psa 131:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#003.md)

"Let Israel hope in the Lord," etc. Remember that he is Jehovah.

I. Wise to plan.

II\. Good to purpose.

III\. Strong to execute, and that he will withhold no good thing from
them that walk uprightly.

IV\. Trust "from henceforth." If you have not begun before, begin now.

V. And do not be weary; trust "for ever." Your case can never be out of
the reach of God's power and mercy. - Adam Clarke.

[Psalms 131:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 131:1</span></span>

1 Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty. neither do I
exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me.

2 Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of
his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.

3 Let Israel hope in the Lord from henceforth and for ever.

[Psa 131:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001.md)

"Lord, my heart is not haughty." The Psalm deals with the Lord, and is a
solitary colloquy with him, not a discourse before men. We have a
sufficient audience when we speak with the Lord, and we may say to him
many things which were not proper for the ears of men. The holy man
makes his appeal to Jehovah, who alone knows the heart' a man should be
slow to do this upon any matter, for the Lord is not to be trifled with;
and when anyone ventures on such an appeal he should be sure of his
case. He begins with his heart, for that is the centre of our nature,
and if pride be there it defiles everything; just as mire in the spring
causes mud in all the streams. It is a grand thing for a man to know his
own heart so as to be able to speak before the Lord about it. It is
beyond all things deceitful and desperately wicked, who can know it? Who
can know it unless taught by the Spirit of God? It is a still greater
thing if, upon searching himself thoroughly, a man can solemnly protest
unto the Omniscient One that his heart is not haughty. that is to say,
neither proud in his opinion of himself, contemptuous to others, nor
self-righteous before the Lord; neither boastful of the past, proud of
the present, nor ambitious for the future. "Nor mine eyes lofty." What
the heart desires the eyes look for. Where the desires run the glances
usually follow. This holy man felt that he did not seek after elevated
places where he might gratify his self-esteem, neither did he look down
upon others as being his inferiors. A proud look the Lord hates; and in
this all men are agreed with him; yea, even the proud themselves hate
haughtiness in the gestures of others. Lofty eyes are so generally
hateful that haughty men have been known to avoid the manners natural to
the proud in order to escape the ill-will of their fellows. The pride
which apes humility always takes care to cast its eyes downward, since
every man's consciousness tells him that contemptuous glances are the
sure ensigns of a boastful spirit. In [Psa
121:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001.md). David lifted up his eyes to
the hills; but here he declares that they were not lifted up in any
other sense. When the heart is right, and the eyes are right, the whole
man is on the road to a healthy and happy condition. Let us take care
that we do not use the language of this Psalm unless, indeed, it be true
as to ourselves; for there is no worse pride than that which claims
humility when it does not possess it.

"Neither do I exercise myself in great matters." As a private man he did
not usurp the power of the king or devise plots against him: he minded
his own business, and left others to mind theirs. As a thoughtful man he
did not pry into things unrevealed; he was not speculative,
self-conceited or opinionated. As a secular person he did not thrust
himself into the priesthood as Saul had done before him, and as Uzziah
did after him. It is well so to exercise ourselves unto godliness that
we know our true sphere, and diligently keep to it. Many through wishing
to be great have failed to be good: they were not content to adorn the
lowly stations which the Lord appointed them, and so they have rushed at
grandeur and power; and found destruction where they looked for honour.
"Or in things too high for me." High things may suit others who are of
greater stature, and yet they may be quite unfit for us. A man does well
to know his own size. Ascertaining his own capacity, he will be foolish
if he aims at that which is beyond his reach, straining himself, and
thus injuring himself. Such is the vanity of many men that if a work be
within their range they despise it, and think it beneath them: the only
service which they are willing to undertake is that to which they have
never been called, and for which they are by no means qualified. What a
haughty heart must he have who will not serve God at all unless he may
be trusted with five talents at the least! His looks are indeed lofty
who disdains to be a light among his poor friends and neighbours here
below, but demands to be created a star of the first magnitude to shine
among the upper ranks, and to be admired by gazing crowds. It is just on
God's part that those who wish to be everything should end in being
nothing. It is a righteous retribution from God when every matter turns
out to be too great for the man who would only handle great matters, and
every thing proves to be too high for the man who exercised himself in
things too high for him. Lord, make us lowly, keep us lowly, fix us for
ever in lowliness. Help us to be in such a case that the confession of
this verse may come from our lips as a truthful utterance which we dare
make before the Judge of all the earth.

[Psa 131:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#002.md)

"Surely I have behaved and quieted myself." The original bears somewhat
of the form of an oath, and therefore our translators exhibited great
judgment in introducing the word "surely"; it is not a literal version,
but it correctly gives the meaning. The Psalmist had been upon his best
behaviour, and had smoothed down the roughnesses of his self-will; by
holy effort he had mastered his own spirit, so that towards God he was
not rebellious, even as towards man he was not haughty. It is no easy
thing to quiet yourself: sooner may a man calm the sea, or rule the
wind, or tame a tiger, than quiet himself. We are clamorous, uneasy,
petulant; and nothing but grace can make us quiet under afflictions,
irritations, and disappointments. "As a child that is weaned of his
mother." He had become as subdued and content as a child whose weaning
is fully accomplished. The Easterns put off the time of weaning far
later than we do, and we may conclude that the process grows none the
easier by being postponed. At last there must be an end to the suckling
period, and then a battle begins: the child is denied his comfort, and
therefore frets and worries, flies into pets, or sinks into sulks. It is
lacing its first great sorrow, and it is in sore distress. Yet time
brings not only alleviations, but the ending of the conflict; the boy
ere long is quite content to find his nourishment at the table with his
brothers, and he feels no lingering wish to return to those dear
fountains from which he once sustained his life. He is no longer angry
with his mother, but buries his head in that very bosom after which he
pined so grievously: he is weaned on his mother rather than from her.

"My soul doth like a weanling rest,

I cease to weep;

So mother's lap, though dried her breast,

Can lull to sleep."

To the weaned child his mother is his comfort though she has denied him
comfort. It is a blessed mark of growth out of spiritual infancy when we
can forego the joys which once appeared to be essential, and can find
our solace in him who denies them to us: then we behave manfully, and
every childish complaint is hushed. If the Lord removes our dearest
delight we bow to his will without a murmuring thought; in fact, we find
a delight in giving up our delight. This is no spontaneous fruit of
nature, but a well-tended product of divine grace: it grows out of
humility and lowliness, and it is the stern upon which peace blooms as a
fair flower. "My soul is even as a weaned child"; or it may be read, "as
a weaned child on me my soul," as if his soul leaned upon him in mute
submission, neither boasting nor complaining. It is not every child of
God who arrives at this weanedness speedily. Some are sucklings when
they ought to be fathers; others are hard to wean, and cry, and fight,
and rage against their heavenly parent's discipline. When we think
ourselves safely through the weaning, we sadly discover that the old
appetites are rather wounded than slain, and we begin crying again for
the breasts which we had given up, It is easy to begin shouting before
we are out of the wood, and no doubt hundreds have sung this Psalm long
before they have understood it. Blessed are those afflictions which
subdue our affections, which wean us from self-sufficiency, which
educate us into Christian manliness, which teach us to love God not
merely when he comforts us, but even when he tries us. Well might the
sacred poet repeat his figure of the weaned child; it is worthy of
admiration and imitation; it is doubly desirable and difficult of
attainment. Such weanedness from self springs from the gentle humility
declared in [Psa 131:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001.md), and partly
accounts for its existence. If pride is gone, submission will be sure to
follow; and, on the other hand, if pride is to be driven out, self must
also be vanquished.

[Psa 131:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#003.md)

"Let Israel hope in the Lord from henceforth and for ever." See how
lovingly a man who is weaned from self thinks of others! David thinks of
his people, and loses himself in his care for Israel. How he prizes the
grace of hope! He has given up the things which are seen, and therefore
he values the treasures which are not seen except by the eyes of hope.
There is room for the largest hope when self is gone, ground for eternal
hope when transient things no longer hold the mastery of our spirits.
This verse is the lesson of experience: a man of God who had been taught
to renounce the world and live upon the Lord alone, here exhorts all his
friends and companions to do the same. He found it a blessed thing to
live by hope, and therefore he would have all his kinsmen do the same.
Let all the nation hope, let all their hope be in Jehovah, let them at
once begin hoping "from henceforth," and let them continue hoping "for
ever." Weaning takes the child out of a temporary condition into a state
in which he will continue for the rest of his life: to rise above the
world is to enter upon a heavenly existence which can never end. When we
cease to hanker for the world we begin hoping in the Lord. O Lord, as a
parent weans a child, so do thou wean me, and then shall I fix all my
hope on thee alone.
