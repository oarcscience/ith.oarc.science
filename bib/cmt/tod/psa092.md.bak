### [Psalms Chapter 92](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 92:0</span></span>

Title. - A Psalm or Song for the Sabbath-day. This admirable composition
is both a Psalm and a Song, full of equal measures of solemnity and toy;
and it was intended to be sung upon the day of rest. The subject is the
praise of God; praise is Sabbatic work, the joyful occupation of resting
hearts. Since a true Sabbath can only be found in God, it is wise to
meditate upon him on the, Sabbath day. The style is worthy of the theme
and of the day, its inspiration is from the "fount of every blessing";
David spake as the Spirit gave him utterance. In the church of Christ,
at this hour, no Psalm is more frequently sung upon the Lord's day than
the present. The delightful version of Dr. Watts is familiar to us all -

"Sweet is the work, my God, my King,

To praise thy name give thanks, and sing;

To skew thy leave by morning light,

and talk of all thy truth at night."

The Sabbath was set apart for adoring the Lord in his finished work of
creation, hence the suitableness of this Psalm; Christians may take even
a higher flight, for they celebrate complete redemption. No one
acquainted with David's style will hesitate to ascribe to him the
authorship of this divine hymn, the ravings of the Rabbis who speak of
its being composed by Adam, only need to be mentioned to be dismissed.
Adam in Paradise had neither harps to play upon, nor wicked men to
contend with.

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Title

This is entitled "A Psalm to be sung on the day of the Sabbath." It is
known that the Jews appropriated certain Psalms to particular days. R.
Selomo thinks that it refers to the future state of the blessed, which
is a perpetual sabbath. Others pretend that it was composed by Adam, on
the seventh day of the creation. It might, with more probability, have
been supposed to be put, by a poetic fiction, into the mouth of Adam,
beholding, with wonder and gratitude, the recent creation. But [Psa
92:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#002.md) seems to refer to the morning and
evening sacrifice, which the Psalmist considers as most proper for
prayer and praise. - D. Cresswell.

Title

"For the Sabbath day." Perchance, as Lud. de Dieu remarks on this place,
every day of the week had its allotted Psalms, according to what is said
in the Talmud, lib. קדשׁים. The songs which the Levites formerly sang in
the sanctuary are these: on the first day, [Psa
24:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001.md); on the second, [Psa
48:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001.md); on the third, [Psa
82:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#001.md); on the fourth, [Psa
104:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#001.md); on the fifth, [Psa
81:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#001.md); on the sixth, [Psa
93:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#001.md); on the seventh, [Psa
92:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#001.md), the beginning of which is, a
Psalm or a Canticle for the Sabbath day, that is to say, for the future
age, which will be altogether a sabbath. - Martin Geier.

Title

"For the Sabbath." - It is observable that the name Jehovah occurs in
the Psalm seven times - the sabbatical number ([Psa
92:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#001.md), [Psa
92:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#004.md), [Psa
92:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#005.md), [Psa
92:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#008.md), [Psa
92:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#009.md), [Psa
92:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#013.md), [Psa
92:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#015).md). - C. Wordsworth.

[Psa 92:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#001.md)

"It is a good thing." It is bonum, honestum, jucundum, utile; an honest,
pleasant, and profitable good. The altar of incense was to be overlaid
with pure gold, and to have a crown of gold round about it. Which (if we
may allegorically apply it) intimateth unto us, that the spiritual
incense of prayers and praises is rich and precious, a golden, and a
royal thing. - Henry Jeanes, in "The Works of Heaven upon Earth," 1649.

[Psa 92:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#001.md)

"It is a good thing to give thanks," etc. Giving of thanks is more noble
and perfect in itself than petition; because in petition often our own
good is eyed and regarded, but in giving of thanks only God's honour.
The Lord Jesus said, "It is more blessed to give than to receive." Now,
a subordinate end of petition is to receive some good from God, but the
sole end of thanks is to give glory unto God. - William Ames
(1576-1633), in "Medulla Theologica."

[Psa 92:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#001.md)

"Give thanks; praises." We thank God for his benefits, and praise him
for his perfections. - Filliucius, out of Aquinas.

[Psa 92:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#001.md)

"To sing praises."

I. Singing is the music of nature. The Scriptures tell us, the mountains
sing ([Isa 44:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#023).md); the valleys sing
([Psa 65:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#013).md); the trees of the wood
sing ([Ch1 16:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#033).md). Nay, the air is the
birds' music-room, where they chant their musical notes.

II\. Singing is the music of ordinances. Augustine reports of himself,
that when he came to Milan and heard the people sing, he wept for joy in
the church to hear that pleasing melody. And Beza confesses, that at his
first entrance into the congregation, and hearing them sing Ps 91, he
felt himself exceedingly comforted, and did retain the sound of it
afterwards upon his heart. The Rabbis tell us, that the Jews, after the
feast of the Passover was celebrated, sang [Psa
111:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#001.md), and the five following
Psalms; and our Saviour and his apostles "sang an hymn" immediately
after the blessed supper, ([Mat
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#030).md).

III\. Singing is the music of saints.

1\. They have performed this duty in their greatest numbers, ([Psa
149:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#001).md).

2\. In their greatest straits, ([Isa
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#019).md).

3\. In their greatest flight, ([Isa
42:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#010.md), [Isa
42:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#011).md).

4\. In their greatest deliverances, ([Isa
65:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#014).md).

5\. In their greatest plenties. In all these changes singing hath been
their stated duty and delight. And indeed it is meet that the saints and
servants of God should sing forth their joys and praises to the Lord
Almighty; every attribute of him can set both their song and their tune.

IV\. Singing is the music of angels. Job tells us, "The morning stars
sang together," ([Job 38:7](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#007).md). Now these
morning stars, as Pineda tells us, are the angels; to which the Chaldee
paraphrase accords, naming these morning stars, aciem angelorum, "a host
of angels." Nay, when this heavenly host was sent to proclaim the birth
of our dearest Jesus, they delivered their message in this raised way of
duty, ([Luk 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#013).md). They were
εἰνούντων, delivering their messages in a "laudatory singing," the whole
company of angels making a musical choir. Nay, in heaven, there is the
angels' joyous music, they there sing hallelujahs to the Most High, and
to the Lamb who sits upon the throne, ([Rev
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#011.md), [Rev
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#012).md).

V. Singing is the music of heaven. The glorious saints and angels accent
their praises this way, and make one harmony in their state of
blessedness; and this is the music of the bride-chamber, ([Rev
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#003).md). The saints who were tuning here
their Psalms, are now singing hallelujahs in a louder strain, and
articulating their joys, which here they could not express to their
perfect satisfaction. Here they laboured with drowsy hearts, and
faltering tongues; but in glory these impediments are removed, and
nothing is left to jar their joyous celebrations. - John Wells ( -
1676), in "The Morning Exercises."

[Psa 92:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#002.md)

"In the morning." When indeed the mind after the rest of the night is
more active, devoted and constant. In other parts of the day, as at
noon, or in the afternoon, many sounds of business disturb, and greater
lassitude oppresses. Compare [Psa 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#004.md),
[Psa 59:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#017.md), [Psa
63:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#002.md), [Psa
88:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#014.md), [Psa
119:147](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#147.md), [Psa
119:148](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#148.md), where this same part of the
day is celebrated as the fittest for sacred meditations. However, this
ought not to be taken exclusively, as if in the morning alone, and not
also at noon or in the evening, it was suitable to celebrate divine
grace. - Martin Geier.

[Psa 92:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#002.md)

"In the morning." The Brahmins rise three hours before the sun, to pray.
The Indians would esteem it a great sin to eat in the morning before
praying to their gods. The ancient Romans considered it impious if they
had not a little chamber in their house, appropriated to prayer. Let us
take a lesson from these Turks and heathen; their zealous ardour ought
to shame us. Because we possess the true light, should their zeal
surpass ours? - Frederic Arndt, in "Lights of the Morning," 1861.

[Psa 92:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#002.md)

"To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning." Our praise ought to
be suitably arranged. In the time of prosperity or the morning we should
declare thy lovingkindness, because whatever of prosperity we have
proceeds from the mercy and grace of God; and in the time of adversity
or night, we should declare thy justice or faithfulness, because
whatever adversity happens to us is ordained by the just judgment of
God. - J. Turrecremata.

[Psa 92:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#002.md)

God's "mercy" is itself the morning rail, which scatters away darkness
([Psa 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#005.md), [Psa
59:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#016).md); his "faithfulness" the
guardian, that assures us against night peril. - F. Delitzsch.

[Psa 92:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#002.md)

"In the morning, and every night." God is Alpha and Omega. It is fit we
should begin and end the day with his praise, who begins and ends it for
us with mercy. Well, thou seest thy duty plainly laid before thee. As
thou wouldst have God prosper thy labour in the day, and sweeten thy
rest in the night, clasp them both together with thy morning and evening
devotions. He that takes no care to set forth God's portion of time in
the morning, doth not only rob God of his due, but is a thief to himself
all the day after, by losing the blessing which a faithful prayer might
bring from heaven on his undertakings. And he that closeth his eyes at
night without prayer, lies down before his bed is made. - William
Gurnall.

[Psa 92:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#002.md)

"Thy faithfulness (Vulg. 'veritas,') every night." Truth can be taken in
its proper signification. Thus St. Jerome on our Psalm takes it, and
says: "The truth of the Lord is announced in the night, as if it were
wrapped up in some verbal obscurities. In an enigma it is spoken, and in
parables; that seeing, they should not see, and hearing, they should not
understand. Moses ascended mount Sinai, Exod. 24, and passed into the
tempest and into the blackness and darkness, and there spake with the
Lord." Thus Jerome. Christ brings back the light to us, as Lactantius
teaches. Shall we wait, says he, till Socrates shall know something? Or
Anaxagoras find light in the darkness? Or Democritus draw forth the
truth from a well? Or till Empedocles expands the paths of his soul? Or
Ascesilas and Carneades see, feel, and perceive? Behold a voice from
heaven teaches us the truth, and reveals it more clearly to us than the
sun himself In the night truth is to be shown forth, that the night may
be turned into day. - Le Blanc.

[Psa 92:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#003.md)

"Upon an instrument of ten strings." Eusebius, in his comment on this
Psalm, says: "The psaltery of ten strings is the worship of the Holy
Spirit performed by means of the five senses of the body, and by the
five powers of the soul." And to confirm this interpretation, he quotes
the apostle, [Co1 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#015.md) : "I will pray
with the spirit, and with the understanding also; I will sing with the
spirit, and with the understanding also." "As the mind has its influence
by which it moves the body, so the spirit has its own influence by which
it moves the soul." Whatever may be thought of this gloss, one thing is
pretty evident from it, that instrumental music was not in use in the
church of Christ in the time of Eusebius, which was near the middle of
the fourth century. Had any such thing then existed in the Christian
Church, he would have doubtless alluded to or spiritualized it; or, as
he quoted the words of the apostle above, would have shown that carnal
usages were substituted for spiritual exercises. - Adam Clarke.

[Psa 92:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#003.md)

In Augustine to Ambrose there is the following passage bearing on this
same subject, "Sometimes, from over jealousy, I would entirely put from
me and from the church the melodies of the sweet chants that we use in
the Psalter, lest our ears seduce us; and the way of Athanasius, bishop
of Alexandria, seems the safe one, who, as I have often heard, made the
reader chant with so slight a change of voice, that it was more like
speaking than singing. And yet, when I call to mind the tears I shed
when I heard the chants of thy church in the infancy of my recovered
faith, and reflect that I was affected, not by the mere music, but by
the subject brought out as it were by clear voices and appropriate tune,
then, in turn, I confess how useful is the practice."

[Psa 92:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#003.md)

We are not to conceive that God enjoyed the harp as feeling a delight
like ourselves in mere melody of sounds; but the Jews, who were yet
under age, were restricted to the use of such childish elements. The
intention of them was to stimulate the worshippers, and stir them up
more actively to the celebration of the praise of God with the heart. We
are to remember that the worship of God was never understood to consist
in such outward services, which were only necessary to help forward a
people, as yet weak and rude in knowledge, in the spiritual worship of
God. A difference is to be observed in this respect between his people
under the Old and under the New Testament; for now that Christ has
appeared, and the church has reached full age, it were only to bury the
light of the Gospel, should we introduce the shadows of a departed
dispensation. From this, it appears that the Papists, in employing
instrumental music, cannot be said so much to imitate the practice of
God's ancient people, as to ape it in a senseless and absurd manner,
exhibiting a silly delight in that worship of the Old Testament which
was figurative, and terminated with the gospel. - John Calvin.

[Psa 92:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#003.md)

Chrysostom says, "Instrumental music was only permitted to the Jews, as
sacrifice was, for the heaviness and grossness of their souls. God
condescended to their weakness, because they were lately drawn off from
idols; but now instead of organs, we may use our own bodies to praise
him withal." Theodoret has many like expressions in his comments upon
the Psalms and other places. But the author under the name of Justin
Martyr is more express in his determination, as to matter of fact,
telling us plainly, "that the use of singing with instrumental music was
not received in the Christian churches as it was among the Jews in their
infant state, but only the use of plain song." - Joseph Bingham.

[Psa 92:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#003.md)

Instrumental music, the more I think of it, appears with increasing
evidence to be utterly unsuited to the genius of the gospel
dispensation. There was a glare, if I may so express it, which
characterized even the divine appointments of Judaism. An august temple,
ornamented with gold and silver, and precious stones, golden
candlesticks, golden altars, priests in rich attire, trumpets, cymbals,
harps; all of which were adapted to an age and dispensation when the
church was in a state of infancy. But when the substance is come, it is
time that the shadows flee away. The best exposition of harps in singing
is given by Dr. Watts -

"Oh may my heart in tune be found,

Like David's harp of solemn sound."

\- Andrew Fuller.

[Psa 92:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#003) (last clause.md)

"On meditation with a harp." \[New translation.\] By a bold but
intelligible figure, meditation is referred to as an instrument,
precisely as the lyre and harp are, the latter being joined with it as a
mere accompaniment. - J. A. Alexander.

[Psa 92:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#003.md)

"With a solemn sound." Let Christians abound as much as they will in the
holy, heavenly exercise of singing in God's house and in their own
houses; but let it be performed as a holy act, wherein they have
immediately and visibly to do with God. When any social open act of
devotion or solemn worship of God is performed, God should be reverenced
as present. As we would not have the ark of God depart from us, nor
provoke God to make a breach upon us, we should take heed that we handle
the ark with reverence. - Jonathan Edwards, in "Errors connected with
singing praises to God."

[Psa 92:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#004.md)

"Thou Lord hast made me glad through thy work." One of the parts of the
well-spending of the Sabbath, is the looking upon, and consideration of
the works of creation. The consideration of the Lord's works will afford
us much sweet refreshment and joy when God blesses the meditation; and
when it is so we ought to acknowledge our gladness most thankfully and
lift up our heart in his ways. - David Dickson.

[Psa 92:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#004.md)

"Thy work." The "work of God" here is one no less marvellous than that
of creation, which was the original ground of hallowing the Sabbath (see
title of this Psalm) - namely, the final redemption of his people. - A.
R. Fausset.

[Psa 92:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#004.md)

"Made me glad through thy work," etc. Surely there is nothing in the
world, short of the most undivided reciprocal attachment, that has such
power over the workings of the human heart as the mild sweetness of
Nature. The most ruffled temper, when emerging from the town, will
subside into a calm at the sight of an extended landscape reposing in
the twilight of a fine evening. It is then that the spirit of peace
settles upon the heart, unfetters the thoughts, and elevates the soul to
the Creator. It is then that we behold the Parent of the universe in his
works; we see his grandeur in earth, sea, sky; we feel his affection in
the emotions which they raise, and half-mortal, half-etherealized,
forget where we are in the anticipation of what that world must be, of
which this lovely earth is merely the shadow. - Miss Porter.

[Psa 92:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#004.md)

"I will triumph in the works of thy hands." Here it will be most fitting
to remind the reader of those three great bursts of adoring song, which
in different centuries have gushed forth from souls enraptured with the
sight of nature. They are each of them clear instances of triumphing in
the works of God's hands. How majestically Milton sang when he said of
our unfallen parents, -

"Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise

Their Maker, in fit strains pronounc'd or sung

Unmeditated: such prompt eloquence

Flow'd from their lips, in prose or numerous verse,

More tunable than needed lute or harp To add more sweetness."

Then he gives us that noble hymn, too well-known for us to quote, the
reader will find it in the fifth book of the Paradise Lost, commencing -

"These are thy glorious works, Parent of good, Almighty!"

Thomson also, in his Seasons, rises to a wonderful height, as he closes
his poem with a hymn -

"These, as they change, Almighty Father, these

Are but the varied God."

Coleridge in his "Hymn before Sun-rise, in the Vale of Chamouni,"
equally well treads the high places of triumphant devotion, as he cries
-

"Awake my soul! not only passive praise

Thou owest! not alone these swelling tears,

Mute thanks and secret ecstacy! Awake,

Voice of sweet song! Awake, my heart, awake!

Green vales and icy cliffs, all join my hymn."

[Psa 92:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#005.md)

"Thy thoughts." The plural of מחשׁבת, from the verb חשׁב, to meditate,
to count, to weave; and this last word gives a good idea of what is here
made the subject of admiration and praise, the wonderful intricacy and
contrivance with which the Divine Mind designs and executes his plans,
till at length the result is seen in a beautifully woven tissue of many
delicately mingled and coloured threads. - Christopher Wordsworth.

[Psa 92:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#005.md)

"Thy thoughts are very deep." Verily, my brethren, there is no sea so
deep as these thoughts of God, who maketh the wicked flourish, and the
good suffer: nothing so profound, nothing so deep: therein every
unbelieving soul is wrecked, in that depth, in that profundity. Dost
thou wish to cross this depth? Remove not from the wood of Christ's
cross; and thou shalt not sink: hold thyself fast to Christ. -
Augustine.

[Psa 92:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#006.md)

Expressively he wrote: "The man-brute will not know; the fool will not
understand this," viz., that when the wicked spring up with rapid and
apparently vigorous growth as the summer flowers in Palestine, it is
that they may ripen soon for a swift destruction. The man-brute
precisely translates the Hebrew words; one whom God has endowed with
manhood, but who has debased himself to brute-hood; a man as being of
God's creation in his own image, but a brute as being self-moulded
(shall we say self-made? ) into the image of the baser animals! - Henry
Cowles.

[Psa 92:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#006.md)

"A brutish man knoweth not," etc. A sottish sensualist who hath his soul
for salt only, to keep his body from putrefying (as we say of swine) he
takes no knowledge of God's great works, but grunts and goes his ways,
contenting himself with a natural use of the creatures, as beasts do. -
John Trapp.

[Psa 92:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#006.md)

"A brutish man knoweth not," etc. That is, he being a beast, and having
no sanctified principle of wisdom in him, looks no further than a beast
into all the works of God and occurrences of things; looks on all
blessings as things provided for man's delight by God; but he extracts
seldom holy, spiritual, and useful thoughts out of all, he wants the art
of doing it. - Thomas Goodwin.

[Psa 92:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#006.md)

"A brutish man knoweth not." How universally do men strive, by the
putrid joys of sense and passion, to destroy the fineness of the
sensibilities which God has given them! This mind, which might behold a
world of glory in created things, and look through them as through a
transparent veil to things infinitely more glorious, signified or
contained within the covering, is as dull and heavy as a piece of
anthracite coal. Who made it so? Alas, habits of sense and sin have done
this. If from childhood the soul had been educated for God, in habits
accordant with its spiritual nature, it would be full of life, love, and
sensibility, in harmony with all lovely things in the natural world,
beholding the spiritual world through the natural, alive to all
excitement from natural and intellectual beauty, and as ready to its
duty as a child to its play. What a dreadful destruction of the mind's
inner sensibilities results from a sensual life! What a decline, decay,
and paralysis of its intuitive powers, so that the very existence of
such a thing as spiritual intuition, in reference to a spiritual world,
may be questioned, if not denied!

A man may be frightfully successful in such a process of destruction if
long enough continued, upon his own nature. "Who can read without
indignation of Kant," remarks De Quincey, "that at his own table, in
social sincerity and confidential talk, let him say what he would in his
books, he exulted in the prospect of absolute and ultimate annihilation;
that he planted his glory in the grave, and was ambitious of rotting for
ever! The King of Prussia, though a personal friend of Kant's, found
himself obliged to level his State thunders at some of his doctrines,
and terrified him in his advance; else I am persuaded that Kant would
have formally delivered Atheism from the Professor's chair, and would
have enthroned the horrid ghoulish creed, which privately he professed,
in the University of Knigsberg. It required the artillery of a great
king to make him pause. The fact is, that as the stomach has been known
by means of its natural secretion, to attack not only whatsoever alien
body is introduced within it, but also (as John Hunter first showed),
sometimes to attack itself and its own organic structure; so, and with
the same preternatural extension of instinct, did Kant carry forward his
destroying functions, until he turned them upon his own hopes, and the
pledges of his own superiority to the dog, the ape, the worm." George B.
Cheever, in "Voices of Nature," 1852.

[Psa 92:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#006.md)

"A fool." The simpleton is an automaton, he is a machine, he is worked
by a spring; mere gravity carries him forward, makes him move, makes him
turn, and that unceasingly and in the same way, and exactly with the
same equable pace: he is uniform, he is never inconsistent with himself;
whoever has seen him once, has seen him at all moments, and in all
periods of his life; he is like the ox who bellows, or the blackbird
which whistles: that which is least visible in him is his soul; it does
not act, it is not exercised, it takes its rest. - Jean de la Bruyre
(1639-1696), quoted by Ramage.

[Psa 92:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#006.md)

"Neither doth a fool understand this."

He roved among the vales and streams,

In the green wood and hollow dell;

They were his dwellings night and day,

But nature ne'er could find the way

Into the heart of Peter Bell.

In vain, through every changeful year,

Did Nature lead him as before;

A primrose by a river's brim

A yellow primrose was to him

And it was nothing more.

In vain, through water, earth, and air,

The soul of happy sound was spread,

When Peter on some April morn,

Beneath the broom or budding thorn,

Made the warm earth his lazy bed.

At noon, when by the forest's edge

He lay beneath the branches high,

The soft blue sky did never melt

Into his heart; he never felt

The witchery of the soft blue sky

There was a hardness in his cheek,

There was a hardness in his eye.

As if the man had fixed his face,

In many a solitary place,

Against the wind and open sky.

\- W. Wordsworth, 1770-1850.

"When the wicked spring as the grass," etc. Their felicity is the
greatest infelicity. - Adam Clarke.

[Psa 92:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#007.md)

Little do they think that they are suffered to prosper that like beasts
they may be fitter for slaughter. The fatter they are, the fitter for
slaughter, and the sooner slain: "He slew the fattest of them," [Psa
78:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#031.md). - Zachary Bogan.

[Psa 92:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#008.md)

Here is the central pivot of the Psalm. "But thou, Lord, art most high
for evermore," lit., "art height," &c., the abstract used for the
concrete, to imply that the essence of all that is high is concentrated
in Jehovah. When God and the cause of holiness seem low, God is really
never higher than then; for out of seeming weakness he perfects the
greatest strength. When the wicked seem high, they are then on the verge
of being cast down for ever. The believer who can realize this will not
despair at the time of his own depression, and of the seeming exaltation
of the wicked. If we can feel "Jehovah most high for evermore," we can
well be unruffled, however low we lie. - A. R. Fausset.

[Psa 92:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#009.md)

"Lo thine enemies;" "lo thine enemies." He represents their destruction
as present, and as certain, which the repetition of the words implies. -
Matthew Pool.

[Psa 92:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#009.md)

"Thine enemies shall perish." This is the only Psalm in the Psalter
which is designated a Sabbath-song. The older Sabbath was a type of our
rest in Christ from sin; and therefore the final extirpation of sin
forms one of the leading subjects of the Psalm. - Joseph Francis Thrupp.

[Psa 92:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#009.md)

"All the workers of iniquity shall be scattered." The wicked may unite
and confederate together, but the bands of their society are feeble. It
is seldom that they long agree together; at least as to the particular
object of their pursuit. Though they certainly harmonize in the general
one, that of working iniquity. But God will soon by his power, and in
his wrath, confound and scatter them even to destruction. - Samuel
Burder.

[Psa 92:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#010.md)

"Thou shalt lift up, as a reym, my horn," seems to point to the mode in
which the bovidae use their horns, lowering the head and then tossing it
up. - William Houghton, in Smith's Bible Dictionary.

"The horn of an unicorn." - After discussing the various accounts which
are given of this animal by ancient and modern writers, Winer says, I do
not hesitate to say, it is the Antelope Leucoryx, a species of goat with
long and sharp horns. - William Walford.

[Psa 92:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#010.md)

"I shall be anointed with fresh oil." Montanus has, instead of "fresh
oil," given the literal meaning of the original virido oleo, "with green
oil." Ainsworth also renders it: "fresh or green oil." The remark of
Calmet is: "The plants imparted somewhat of their colour, as well as of
their fragrance, hence the expression, "green oil." Harmer says, "I
shall be anointed with green oil." Some of these writers think the term
green, as it is in the original, signifies "precious fragrant oil;"
others, literally "green" in colour; and others, "fresh" or newly-made
oil. But I think it will appear to mean "cold-drawn oil," that which has
been expressed or squeezed from the nut or fruit without the process of
boiling. The Orientals prefer this kind to all others for anointing
themselves; it is considered the most precious, the most pure and
efficacious. Nearly all their medicinal oils are thus extracted; and
because they cannot gain so much by this method as by the boiling
process, oils so drawn are very dear. Hence their name for the article
thus prepared is also patche, that is, "green oil." But this term, in
Eastern phraseology, is applied to other things which are unboiled or
raw; thus unboiled water is called patchetameer, "green water:"
patchėpal, likewise, "green milk," means that which has not been boiled,
and the butter made from it is called "green butter;" and uncooked meat
or yams are known by the same name. I think, therefore, the Psalmist
alludes to that valuable article which is called "green off," on account
of its being expressed from the nut or fruit, without the process of
boiling. - Joseph Roberts's Oriental Illustrations.

[Psa 92:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#010.md)

"Anointed with fresh oil." Every kind of benediction and refreshment I
have received, do receive, and shall receive, like one at a feast, who
is welcomed as a friend, and whose head is copiously anointed with oil
or fragrant balm. In this way, the spirits are gently refreshed, an
inner joyousness excited, the beauty of the face and limbs, according to
the custom of the country, brought to perfection. Or, there is an
allusion to the custom of anointing persons at their solemn installation
in some splendid office. Compare [Psa
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#005.md), "Thou anointest my head with
oil," and [Psa 45:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#007.md), "God, thy God,
hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness." - Martin Geier.

[Psa 92:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#010) (last clause.md)

The phrase is not "I am anointed," משח; but בלּתי, imbutus sum -
perfusus sum; apparently in reference to the abundance of perfume
employed on the occasion, viz., his being elected King over all the
tribes, as indicative of the greater popularity of the act, or the
higher measure of Jehovah's blessing on his people. The difference,
indeed, between the first anointing of David and that of Saul, as
performed by Samuel, is well worthy of notice on the present occasion.
When Samuel was commanded to anoint Saul, he "took a vial of oil, and
poured it upon his head," in private, [Sa1
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#013.md). Here we find the horn again
made use of, and apparently full to the brim - David was soaked or
imbued with it. - John Mason Good.

[Psa 92:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#011.md)

"Mine enemies." - The word here used שּׁוּר shur - occurs nowhere else.
It means, properly, a lier-in-wait, one who watches; one who is in
ambush; and refers to persons who watched his conduct; who watched for
his ruin. - A. Barnes.

[Psa 92:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#012.md)

"Like the palm tree." Look now at those stately palm-trees, which stand
here and there on the plain, like military sentinels, with feathery
plumes nodding gracefully on their proud heads. The stem, tall, slender,
and erect as Rectitude herself, suggests to the Arab poets many a symbol
for their lady-love; and Solomon, long before them, has sung, "How fair
and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights! This thy stature is
like a palm-tree," (S. [Sol 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#006.md), [Sol
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#007).md). Yes; and Solomon's father says,
"The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree," etc. The royal poet
has derived more than one figure from the-customs of men, and the habits
of this noble tree, with which to adorn his sacred ode. The palm grows
slowly, but steadily, from century to century uninfluenced by those
alternations of the seasons which affect other trees. It does not
rejoice over much in winter's copious rain, nor does it droop under the
drought and the burning sun of summer. Neither heavy weights which men
place upon its head, nor the importunate urgency of the wind, can sway
it aside from perfect uprightness. There it stands, looking calmly down
upon the world below, and patiently yielding its large clusters of
golden fruit from generation to generation. They "bring forth fruit in
old age."

The allusion to being "planted in the house of the Lord" is probably
drawn from the custom of planting beautiful and long-lived trees in the
courts of temples and palaces, and in all "high places" used for
worship. This is still common; nearly every palace, and mosque, and
convent in the country has such trees in the courts, and being well
protected there, they flourish exceedingly.

Solomon covered all the walls of the "Holy of Holies" round about with
palm-trees. They were thus planted, as it were, within the very house of
the Lord; and their presence there was not only ornamental, but
appropriate and highly suggestive. The very best emblem, not only of
patience in well-doing, but of the rewards of the righteous - a fat and
flourishing old age - a peaceful end - a glorious immortality. - W. M.
Thomson.

[Psa 92:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#012.md)

"The palm tree." The palms were entitled by Linnaeus, "the princes of
the vegetable world;" and Von Martius enthusiastically says, "The
common-world atmosphere does not become these vegetable monarchs' but in
those genial climes where nature seems to have fixed her court, and
summons around her of flowers, and fruits, and trees, and animated
beings, a galaxy of beauty, - there they tower up into the balmy air,
rearing their majestic stems highest and proudest of all. Many of them,
at a distance, by reason of their long perpendicular shafts, have the
appearance of columns, erected by the Divine architect, bearing up the
broad arch of heaven above them, crowned with a capital of gorgeous
green foliage." And Humboldt speaks of them as "the loftiest and
stateliest of all vegetable forms." To these, above all other trees, the
prize of beauty has always been awarded by every nation, and it was from
the Asiatic palm world, or the adjacent countries, that human
civilization sent forth the first rays of its early dawn.

On the northern borders of the Great Desert, at the foot of the Atlas
mountains, the groves of date palms form the great feature of that
parched region, and few trees besides can maintain an existence. The
excessive dryness of this arid tract, where rain seldom falls, is such
that wheat refuses to grow, and even barley, maize and Caffre corn,
(Holcus sorghum,) afford the husbandman only a scanty and uncertain
crop. The hot blasts from the south are scarcely supportable even by the
native himself, and yet here forests of date palms flourish, and form a
screen impervious to the rays of the sun, beneath the shade of which the
lemon, the orange, and the pomegranate, are cherished, and the vine
climbs up by means of its twisted tendrils; and although reared in
constant shade, all these fruits acquire a more delicious flavour than
in what would seem a more favourable climate. How beautiful a comment do
these facts supply to the words of Holy Writ, "The righteous shall
flourish like the palm tree!" Unmoved by the scorching and withering
blasts of temptations or persecutions, the Christian sustained by the
secret springs of Divine grace, lives and grows in likeness to his
Divine Master, when all others are overcome, and their professions
wither. How striking is the contrast in the Psalm. The wicked and
worldlings are compared to grass, which is at best but of short
duration, and which is easily withered; but the emblem of the Christian
is the palm tree, which stands for centuries. Like the grateful shade of
the palm groves, the Christian extends around him a genial, sanctified,
and heavenly influence; and just as the great value of the date palm
lies in its abundant, wholesome, and delicious fruit, so do those who
are the true disciples of Christ abound in "fruits of righteousness,"
for, said our Saviour. "Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much
fruit; so shall ye be my disciples." - "The Palm Tribes and their
Varieties." R. T. Society's Monthly Volume.

[Psa 92:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#012.md)

"The righteous shall flourish." David here tells us how he shall
flourish. "He Shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a
cedar in Lebanon." Of the wicked he had said just before, "When the
wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do
flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever." They flourish as
the grass, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven. What a
contrast with the worthlessness, the weakness, transitoriness, and
destiny, of grass - in a warm country too - are the palm tree and cedar
of Lebanon! They are evergreens. How beautifully, how firmly, how
largely, they grow! How strong and lofty is the cedar! How upright, and
majestic, and tall, the palm tree. The palm also bears fruit, called
dates, like bunches of grapes. It sometimes yields a hundredweight at
once.

He tells us where he shall flourish. "Those that be planted in the house
of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God." The allusion is
striking. It compares the house of God to a garden, or fine well-watered
soil, favourable to the life, and verdure, and fertility, of the trees
fixed there. The reason is, that in the sanctuary we have the communion
of saints. There our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son
Jesus Christ. There are dispensed the ordinances of religion, and the
word of truth, There God commandeth the blessing, even life for
evermore.

He also tells us when he shall flourish. "They shall still bring forth
fruit in old age." This is to show the permanency of their principles,
and to distinguish them from natural productions.

"The plants of grace shall ever live;

Nature decays, but grace must thrive;

Time, that doth all things else impair,

Still makes them flourish strong and fair."

The young Christian is lovely, like a tree in the blossoms of spring:
the aged Christian Is valuable, like a tree in autumn, bending with ripe
fruit. We therefore look for something superior in old disciples. More
deadness to the world, the vanity of which they have had more
opportunities to see; more meekness of wisdom; more disposition to make
sacrifices for the sake of peace; more maturity of judgment in divine
things; more confidence in God; more richness of experience.

He also tells us why he shall flourish. "They shall be fat and
flourishing; to shew that the Lord is upright." we might rather have
supposed that it was necessary to shew that they were upright. But by
the grace of God they are what they are - not they, but the grace of God
which is in them. From him is their fruit found. Their preservation and
fertility, therefore, are to, 'the praise and glory of God' and as what
he does for them he had engaged to do, it displays his truth as well as
his mercy, and proves that he is upright. - William Jay.

[Psa 92:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#012.md)

The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree."

1\. The palm tree grows in the desert. Earth is a desert to the
Christian; true believers are ever refreshed in it as a palm is in the
Arabian desert. So Lot amid Sodom's wickedness, and Enoch who walked
with God amongst the antediluvians.

2\. The palm tree grows from the sand, but the sand is not its food;
water from below feeds its tap roots, though the heavens above be brass.
Some Christians grow, not as the lily, [Hos
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#005.md), by green pastures, or the willow
by water-courses, [Isa 44:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#004.md), but as
the palm of the desert; so Joseph among the Cat-worshippers of Egypt,
Daniel in voluptuous Babylon. Faith's penetrating root reaches the
fountains of living waters.

3\. The palm tree is beautiful, with its tall and verdant canopy, and
the silvery flashes of its waving plumes; so the Christian virtues are
not like the creeper or bramble, tending downwards, their palm branches
shoot upwards, and seek the things above where Christ dwells, [Col
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#001.md) : some trees are crooked and
gnarled, but the Christian is a tall palm as a son of the light, [Mat
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#012.md); [Phi
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#015.md). The Jews were called a crooked
generation, [Deu 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#005.md), and Satan a
crooked serpent, Isai. 32, but the Christian is upright like the palm.
Its beautiful, unfading leaves make it an emblem of victory; it was
twisted into verdant booths at the feast of Tabernacles; and the
multitude, when escorting Christ to his coronation in Jerusalem, spread
leaves on the way, [Mat 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#008.md); so
victors in heaven are represented as having palms in their hands, [Rev
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009.md). No dust adheres to the leaf as it
does with the battree; the Christian is in the world, not of it; the
dust of earth's desert adheres not to his palm leaf. The leaf of the
palm is the same - it does not fall in winter, and even in the summer it
has no holiday-clothing, it is an evergreen; the palm trees' rustling is
the desert orison.

4\. The palm tree is very useful. The Hindus reckon it has 360 uses. Its
shadow shelters, its fruit refreshes the weary traveller, it points out
the place of water: such was Barnabas, a son of consolation, [Act
4:36](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#036.md); such Lydia, Dorcas, and others,
who on the King's highway showed the way to heaven, as Philip did to the
Ethiopian eunuch, [Act 9:34](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#034.md). Jericho
was called the City of Palms, [Deu
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#003.md).

5\. The palm tree produces even to old age. The best dates are produced
when the tree is from thirty to one hundred years old; 300 lbs. of dates
are annually yielded: so the Christian grows happier and more useful as
he becomes older. Knowing his own faults more, be is more mellow to
others: he is like the sun setting, beautiful, mild, and large, looking
like Elfin, where the wearied Jews found twelve wells and seventy palm
trees. - J. Long, in "Scripture Truth in Oriental Dress," 1871.

[Psa 92:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#012.md)

"Palm-tree." The open country moreover wears a sad aspect now: the soil
is rent and dissolves into dust at every breath of wind; the green of
the meadows is almost entirely gone, - the palm-tree alone preserves in
the drought and heat its verdant roof of leaves. - Gotthelf H. Port
Schubert, 1780-1860.

[Psa 92:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#012.md)

"A cedar in Lebanon." Laying aside entirely any enquiry as to the
palm-tree, and laying aside the difficulty contained in [Psa
92:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#013.md), I have only to compare this
description of the cedar in Lebanon with the accounts of those who have
visited them in modern days. Without believing (as the Maronites or
Christian inhabitants of the mountains do), that the seven very ancient
cedars which yet remain in the neighbourhood of the village of Eden in
Lebanon are the remains of the identical forest which furnished Solomon
with timber for the Temple, full three thousand years ago, they can yet
be proved to be of very great antiquity. These very cedars were visited
by Belonius in 1550, nearly three hundred years ago, who found them
twenty-eight in number. Rawolf, in 1575, makes them twenty-four.
Dandini, in 1600, and Thevenot about fifty years after, make them
twenty-three. Maundrell, in 1696, found them reduced to sixteen.
Pococke, in 1738, found fifteen standing, and a sixteenth recently blown
down, or (may we not conjecture? ) shivered by the voice of God. In
1810, Burckhardt counted eleven or twelve; and Dr. Richardson, in 1818,
states them to be no more than seven. There cannot be a doubt, then,
that these cedars which were esteemed ancient nearly three hundred years
ago, must be of a very great antiquity; and yet they are described by
the last of these travellers as "large, and tall, and beautiful, the
most picturesque productions of the vegetable world that we had seen."
The oldest are large and massy, rearing their heads to an enormous
height, and spreading their branches afar. Pococke also remarks, that
"the young cedars are not easily known from pines, I observed, they bear
a greater quantity of fruit than the large ones." This shows that the
old ones still bear fruit, though not so abundantly as the young cedars,
which, according to Richardson, are very productive, and cast many seeds
annually. How appropriate, then, and full of meaning, is the imagery of
the Psalmist: "The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall
grow like a cedar in Lebanon. They shall still bring forth fruit in old
age; they shall be fat and flourishing." - R. M. M'Cheyne.

[Psa 92:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#012.md)

The life and greenness of the branches is an honour to the root by which
they live. Spiritual greenness and fruitfulness is in a believer an
honour to Jesus Christ who is his life. The fulness of Christ is
manifested by the fruitfulness of a Christian. - Ralph Robinson.

[Psa 92:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#013.md)

"Those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the
courts of our God," are not distinctive of some from others, as though
some only of the flourishing righteous were so planted; but they are
descriptive of them all, with an addition of the way and means whereby
they are caused so to grow and flourish. And this is their implantation
in the house of the Lord, - that is, in the church, which is the seat of
all the means of spiritual life, both as unto growth and flourishing,
which God is pleased to grant unto believers. To be planted in the house
of the Lord, is to be fixed and rooted in the grace communicated by the
ordinances of divine worship. Unless we are planted in the house of the
Lord, we cannot flourish in his courts. See [Psa
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003.md). Unless we are partakers of the
grace administered in the ordinances, we cannot flourish in a fruitful
profession. - John Owen.

[Psa 92:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#013.md)

"Those that be planted in the house of the Lord," etc. Saints are
planted in the house of God; they have a kind of rooting there; but
though the tabernacle be a good rooting-place, yet we cannot root firmly
there, unless we are rooted in Jesus Christ. To root in tabernacle work,
or in the bare use of ordinances, as if that would carry it and commend
us to God, when there is no heart work, when there is no looking to the
power of godliness, and to communion with Christ, what is this but
building upon the sand? Many come often to the tabernacle, who are mere
strangers to Christ; they use pure ordinances, but are themselves
impure. These may have a great name in the tabernacle for a while, but
God blots their names, and roots their hopes out of the tabernacle, yea,
he puts them from the horns of the altar, or slays them there, as
Solomon gave commandment concerning Joab. - Abraham Wright.

[Psa 92:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#013.md)

"In the house of the Lord." As if in a most select viridarium, or as if
in a park, abounding in trees dedicated to God. And as in [Psa
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#012.md) he had made mention of Lebanon,
where the cedars attain their highest perfection, so now he tacitly
opposes to Lebanon the house of God, or church, wherein we bloom, grow,
and bring forth fruit pleasing to God. - Martin Geier.

[Psa 92:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#014.md)

"They shall still bring forth fruit in old age." The point on which the
Psalmist in this passage fixes, as he contemplates the blessedness of
God's own children, is the beauty and happiness of their old age. The
court or open area in the centre of an eastern dwelling, and especially
the court of any great and stately dwelling, was often adorned with a
tree, or sometimes with more than one, for beauty, for shade, and, as it
might be, for fruit. There sometimes the palm tree, planted by the cool
fountain, shot up its tall trunk toward the sky, and waved its green
top, far above the roof, in the sun-light and the breeze. There
sometimes the olive, transplanted from the rocky hillside, may have
flourished under the protection and culture of the household, and may
have rewarded their care with the rich abundance of its nutritious
berries. With such images in his mind, the Psalmist, having spoken of
the brief prosperity of the wicked, and having compared it with the
springing and flourishing of the grass, which grows to its little height
only to be immediately cut down, naturally and beautifully compares the
righteous, not with the deciduous herbage, but with the hardy tree that
lives on through the summer's drought and the winter's storms, and from
season to season still renews its growth. These trees of righteousness,
as the poet conceives of them, are "planted in the house of the Lord;"
they stand fair and "flowering in the courts of our God" - even "in old
age they bring forth fruit" - they are "full of sap and flourishing" -
they are living memorials "to show that the Lord is faithful," and that
those who trust in him shall never be confounded. - Leonard Bacon, 1845.

[Psa 92:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#014.md)

There be three things which constitute a spiritual state, or belong to
the life of God. 1. That believers be fat; that is, by the heavenly
juice, sap, or fatness of the true olive, of Christ himself, as [Rom
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#017.md). This is the principle of
spiritual life and grace derived from him. When this abounds in them, so
as to give them strength and rigour in the exercise of grace, to keep
them from decays and withering, they are said to be fat; which, in the
Scripture phrase, is strong and flourish in the greenness (as the word
is) and verdure of profession; for vigorous grace will produce a
flourishing profession. 3. That they still bring forth fruit in all
duties of holy obedience. All these are promised unto them even in old
age.

Even trees, when they grow old (the palm and the cedar), are apt to lose
a part of the 'juice and verdure' and men in old age are subject unto
all sorts of decays, both outward and inward. It is a rare thing to see
a man in old age naturally vigorous, healthy, and strong; and would it
were not more rare to see any spiritually so at the same season! But
this is here promised unto believers as an especial grace and privilege,
beyond what can be represented in the growth or fruit-bearing of plants
and trees. The grace intended is, that when believers are under all
sorts of bodily and natural decays, and, it may be, have been overtaken
with spiritual decays also, there is provision made in the covenant to
render them fat, flourishing, and fruitful, - vigourous in the power of
internal grace, and flourishing in the expression of it in all duties of
obedience; which is that which we now inquire after. Blessed be God for
this good word of his grace, that he hath given us such encouragement
against all the decays and temptations of old age which we have to
conflict withal!

And the Psalmist, in the next words, declares the greatness of the
privilege: "To shew that the Lord is upright: he is my rock, and there
is no unrighteousness in him." Consider the oppositions that lie against
the flourishing of believers in old age, the difficulties of it, the
temptations that must be conquered, the actings of the mind above its
natural abilities which are decayed, the weariness that is apt to befall
us in a long spiritual conflict, the cries of the flesh to be spared,
and we shall see it to be an evidence of the faithfulness, power, and
righteousness of God in covenant; nothing else could produce this mighty
effect. So the prophet, treating of the same promise, [Hos
14:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#004.md), closeth his discourse with
that blessed remark, [Psa 92:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#009.md), "Who
is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and he shall
know them? for the ways of the Lord are right, and the just shall walk
in them." Spiritual wisdom will make us to see that the faithfulness and
power of God are exerted in this work of preserving believers
flourishing and fruitful unto the end. - John Owen.

[Psa 92:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#014.md)

Constancy is an ingredient in the obedience Christ requires. His trees
bring forth fruit in old age. Age makes other things decay, but makes a
Christian flourish. Some are like hot horses, mettlesome at the
beginning of a journey, and tired a long time before they come to their
journey's end. A good disciple, as he would not have from God a
temporary happiness, so he would not give to God a temporary obedience;
as he would have his glory last as long as God lives, so he would have
his obedience last as long as he lives. Judas had a fair beginning, but
destroyed all in the end by betraying his Master. - Stephen Charnock.

[Psa 92:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#014.md)

"Flourishing." Here is not only mention of growing but of flourishing,
and here's flourishing three times mentioned, and 'tis growing and
flourishing not only like a tree, but like a "palm tree," (which
flourisheth under oppression), and like a "cedar" (not growing in
ordinary places, but) "in Lebanon," where were the goodliest cedars. Nor
doth the Spirit promise here a flourishing in boughs and leaves only (as
some trees do, and do no more), but in fruit; and this not only fruit
for once in a year, or one year, but they "still bring forth fruit," and
that not only in the years of their youth, or beginnings in grace, but
"in old age," and that not only in the entrance of that state which is
called old age, threescore years, but that which the Scripture calls the
perfection of old age, threescore years and ten, as the learned Hebrews
observe upon the word used in the Psalm. What a divine climax doth the
Spirit of God make in this Scripture, to show that the godly man as to
his state, is so far from declining, that he is still climbing higher
and higher! - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 92:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#015.md)

"He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him." Implying that
God can no more be moved or removed from doing righteously, than a rock
can be removed out of its place. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psalms 92:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 92:1</span></span>

1 It is a good thing, to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises
unto thy name, O most High:

2 To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness
every night,

3 Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the
harp with a solemn sound.

4 For thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy work; I will triumph in
the works of thy hands.

[Psa 92:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#001.md)

"It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord," or Jehovah. It is
good ethically, for it is the Lord's right; it is good emotionally, for
it is pleasant to the heart; it is good practically, for it leads others
to render the same homage. When duty and pleasure combine, who will be
backward? To give thanks to God is but a small return for the great
benefits wherewith he daily loadeth us; yet as he by his Spirit calls it
a good thing, we must not despise it, or neglect it. We thank men when
they oblige us, how much more ought we to bless the Lord when he
benefits us. Devout praise is always good, it is never out of season,
never superfluous, but it is especially suitable to the Sabbath; a
Sabbath without thanksgiving is a Sabbath profaned. "And to sing praises
unto thy name, O most High." It is good to give thanks in the form of
vocal song. Nature itself teaches us thus to express our gratitude to
God; do not the birds sing, and the brooks warble as they flow? To give
his gratitude a tongue is wise in man. Silent worship is sweet, but
vocal worship is sweeter. To deny the tongue the privilege of uttering
the praises of God involves an unnatural strain upon the most
commendable promptings of our renewed manhood, and it is a problem to us
how the members of the Society of Friends can deprive themselves of so
noble, so natural, so inspiring a part of sacred worship. Good as they
are, they miss one good thing when they decline to sing praises unto the
name of the Lord. Our personal experience has confirmed us in the belief
that it is good to sing unto the Lord; we have often felt like Luther
when he said, "Come, let us sing a Psalm, and drive away the devil."

[Psa 92:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#002.md)

"To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning." The day should begin
with praise; no hour is too early for holy song. Lovingkindness is a
most appropriate theme for those dewy hours when morn is sowing all the
earth with orient pearl. Eagerly and promptly should we magnify the
Lord; we leave unpleasant tasks as long as we can, but our hearts are so
engrossed with the adoration of God that we would rise betimes to attend
to it. There is a peculiar freshness and charm about early morning
praises; the day is loveliest when it first opens its eyelids, and God
himself seems then to make distribution of the day's mamma, which tastes
most sweetly if gathered ere the sun is hot. It seems most meet that if
our hearts and harps have been silent through the shades of night, we
should be eager again to take our place among the chosen choir who
ceaselessly hymn the Eternal One. "And thy faithfulness every night." No
hour is too late for praise, the end of the day must not be the end of
gratitude. When nature seems in silent contemplation to adore its Maker,
it ill becomes the children of God to refrain their thanksgiving.
Evening is the time for retrospect, memory is busy with the experience
of the day, hence the appropriate theme for song is the divine
faithfulness, of which another day has furnished fresh evidences. When
darkness has settled down o'er all things, "a shade immense," then there
comes over wise men a congenial, meditative spirit, and it is most
fitting that they should take an expanded view of the truth and goodness
of Jehovah -

"This sacred shade and solitude, what is it?

'Tis the felt presence of the Deity."

"Every night," clouded or clear, moonlit or dark, calm or tempestuous,
is alike suitable for a song upon the faithfulness of God, since in all
seasons, and under all circumstances, it abides the same, and is the
mainstay of the believer's consolation. Shame on us that we are so
backward in magnifying the Lord, who in the daytime scatters bounteous
love, and in the night season walks his rounds of watching care.

[Psa 92:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#003.md)

"Upon an instrument of ten strings;" with the fullest range of music,
uttering before God with the full compass of melody the richest emotions
of his soul. "And upon the psaltery:" thus giving variety to praise: the
Psalmist felt that every sweet-sounding instrument should be consecrated
to God. George Herbert and Martin Luther aided their private devotions
by instrumental music; and whatever may have been the differences of
opinion in the Christian church, as to the performance of instrumental
music in public, we have met with no objection to its personal and
private use. "Upon the harp with a solemn sound," or upon meditation
with a harp; as much as to say, my meditative soul is, after all, the
best instrument, and the harp's dulcet tones come in to aid my thoughts.
It is blessed work when hand and tongue work together in the heavenly
occupation of praise.

"Strings and voices, hands and hearts,

In the concert bear your parts:

All that breathe, your God adore,

Praise him, praise him, evermore."

It is, however, much to be feared that attention to the mere mechanism
of music, noting keys and strings, bars and crochets, has carried many
away from the spiritual harmony which is the soul and essence of praise.
Fine music without devotion is but a splendid garment upon a corpse.

[Psa 92:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#004.md)

"For thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy work." It was natural for
the Psalmist to sing, because he was glad, and to sing unto the Lord,
because his gladness was caused by a contemplation of the divine work.
If we consider either creation or providence, we shall find overflowing
reasons for joy; but when we come to review the work of redemption,
gladness knows no bounds, but feels that she must praise the Lord with
all her might. There are times when in the contemplation of redeeming
love we feel that if we did not sing we must die; silence would be as
horrible to us as if we were gagged by inquisitors, or stifled by
murderers. "I will triumph in the works of thy hands." I cannot help it,
I must and I will rejoice in the Lord, even as one who has won the
victory and has divided great spoil. In the first sentence of this verse
he expresses the unity of God's work, and in the second the variety of
his works; in both there is reason for gladness and triumph. When God
reveals his work to a man, and performs a work in his soul, he makes his
heart glad most effectually, and then the natural consequence is
continual praise.

[Psalms 92:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 92:5</span></span>

5 O Lord, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep.

6 A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a feel understand this

[Psa 92:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#005.md)

"O Lord, how great are thy works!" He is lost in wonder. He utters an
exclamation of amazement. How vast! How stupendous are the doings of
Jehovah! Great for number, extent, and glory and design are all the
creations of the Infinite One. "And thy thoughts are very deep." The
Lord's plans are as marvellous as his acts; his designs are as profound
as his doings are vast. Creation is immeasurable, and the wisdom
displayed in it unsearchable. Some men think but cannot work, and others
are mere drudges working without thought; in the Eternal the conception
and the execution go together. Providence is inexhaustible, and the
divine decrees which originate it are inscrutable. Redemption is grand
beyond conception, and the thoughts of love which planned it are
infinite. Man is superficial, God is inscrutable; man is shallow, God is
deep. Dive as we may we shall never fathom the mysterious plan, or
exhaust the boundless wisdom of the all-comprehending mind of the Lord.
We stand by the fathomless sea of divine wisdom, and exclaim with holy
awe, "O the depth!"

[Psa 92:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#006.md)

"A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this." In
this and the following verses the effect of the Psalm is heightened by
contrast; the shadows are thrown in to bring out the lights more
prominently. What a stoop from [Psa
92:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#005.md); from the saint to the brute,
from the worshipper to the boor, from the Psalmist to the fool! Yet,
alas, the character described here is no uncommon one. The boorish or
boarish man, for such is almost the very Hebrew word, sees nothing in
nature; and if it be pointed out to him, his foolish mind will not
comprehend it. He may be a philosopher, and yet be such a brutish being
that he will not own the existence of a Maker for the ten thousand
matchless creations around him, which wear, even upon their surface, the
evidences of profound design. The unbelieving heart, let it boast as it
will, does not know; and with all its parade of intellect, it does not
understand. A man must either be a saint or a brute, he has no other
choice; his type must be the adoring seraph, or the ungrateful swine. So
far from paying respect to great thinkers who will not own the glory or
the being of God, we ought to regard them as comparable to the beasts
which perish, only vastly lower than mere brutes, because their
degrading condition is of their own choosing. O God, how sorrowful a
thing it is that men whom thou hast so largely gifted, and made in thine
own image, should so brutify themselves that they will neither see nor
understand what thou hast made so clear. Well might an eccentric writer
say, "God made man a little lower than the angels at first, and he has
been trying to get lower ever since."

[Psalms 92:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 92:7</span></span>

7 When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of
iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever:

8 But thou, Lord, art most high for evermore.

9 For, lo, thine enemies, O Lord, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish;
all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.

[Psa 92:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#007.md)

"When the wicked spring as the grass," in abundance, and apparent
strength, hastening on their progress like verdant plants, which come to
perfection in a day, "and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish;"
flowering in their prime and pride, their pomp and their prosperity; "it
is that they shall be destroyed for ever." They grow to die, they
blossom to be blasted. They flower for a short space to wither without
end. Greatness and glory are to them but the prelude of their overthrow.
Little does their opposition matter, the Lord reigns on as if they had
never blasphemed him; as a mountain abides the same though the meadows
at its feet bloom or wither, even so the Most High is unaffected by the
fleeting mortals who dare oppose him; they shall soon vanish for ever
from among the living. But as for the wicked - how can our minds endure
the contemplation of their doom "for ever." Destruction "for ever" is a
portion far too terrible for the mind to realise. Eye hath not seen, nor
ear heard, the full terror of the wrath to come!

[Psa 92:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#008.md)

"But thou, Lord, art most high for evermore." This is the middle verse
of the Psalm, and the great fact which this Sabbath song is meant to
illustrate. God is at once the highest and most enduring of all beings.
Others rise to fall, but he is the Most High to eternity. Glory be to
his name! How great a God we worship! Who would not fear thee, O thou
High Eternal One! The ungodly are destroyed for ever, and God is most
high for ever; evil is cast down, and the Holy One reigns supreme
eternally.

[Psa 92:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#009.md)

"For, lo, thine enemies, O Lord." It is a wonder full of instruction and
warning, observe it, O ye sons of men; "for, lo, thine enemies shall
perish;" they shall cease from among men, they shall be known no more.
In that the thing is spoken twice it is confirmed by the Lord, it shall
surely be, and that speedily. "All the workers of iniquity shall be
scattered;" their forces shall be dispersed, their hopes broken, and
themselves driven hither and thither like chaff before the tempest. They
shall scatter like timid sheep pursued by the lion, they will not have
the courage to remain in arms, nor the unity to abide in confederacy.
The grass cannot resist the scythe, but falls in withering ranks, even
so are the ungodly cut down and swept away in process of time, while the
Lord whom they despised sits unmoved upon the throne of his infinite
dominion. Terrible as this fact is, no true-hearted man would wish to
have it otherwise. Treason against the great Monarch of the universe
ought not to go unpunished; such wanton wickedness richly merits the
severest doom.

[Psalms 92:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 92:10</span></span>

10 But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn, I shall be
anointed with fresh oil.

11 Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears
shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me.

[Psa 92:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#010.md)

"But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn." The believer
rejoices that he shall not be suffered to perish, but shall be
strengthened and enabled to triumph over his enemies, by the divine aid.
The unicorn may have been some gigantic ox or buffalo now unknown, and
perhaps extinct - among the ancients it was the favourite symbol of
unconquerable power; the Psalmist adopts it as his emblem. Faith takes
delight in foreseeing the mercy of the Lord, and sings of what he will
do as well as of what he has done. "I shall be anointed with fresh oil."
Strengthening shall be attended with refreshment and honour. As guests
were anointed at feasts with perfumed unguents, so shall the saints be
cheered and delighted by fresh outpourings of divine grace; and for this
reason they shall not pass away like the wicked. Observe the contrast
between the happiness of the brutish people and the joy of the
righteous, the brutish men grow with a sort of vegetable vigour of their
own, but the righteous are dealt with by the Lord himself, and all the
good which they receive comes directly from his own right hand, and so
is doubly precious in their esteem. The Psalmist speaks in the first
person, and it should be a matter of prayer with the reader that he may
be enabled to do the same.

[Psa 92:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#011.md)

"Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies." The words, "my
desire," inserted by the translators, had far better have been left out.
He does not say what he should see concerning his enemies, he leaves
that blank, and we have no right to fill in the vacant space with words
which look vindictive. He would see that which would be for God's glory,
and that which would be eminently right and just. "And mine ears shall
hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me." Here, again, the
words "my desire" are not inspired, and are a needless and perhaps a
false interpolation. The good man is quite silent as to what he expected
to hear; he knew that what he should hear would vindicate his faith in
his God, and he was content to leave his cruel foes in God's hands,
without an expression concerning his own desire one way or the other. It
is always best to leave Scripture as we find it. The broken sense of
inspiration is better let alone than pieced out with additions of a
translator's own invention; it is like repairing pure gold with tinsel,
or a mosaic of gems with painted wood. The holy Psalmist had seen the
beginning of the ungodly, and expected to see their end; he felt sure
that God would right all wrongs, and clear his Providence from the
charge of favouring the unjust; this confidence he here expresses, and
sits down contentedly to wait the issues of the future.

[Psalms 92:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 92:12</span></span>

12 The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a
cedar in Lebanon.

13 Those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the
courts of our God.

14 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and
flourishing;

15 To shew that the Lord is upright; he is my rock, and there is no
unrighteousness in him.

[Psa 92:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#012.md)

The song now contrasts the condition of the righteous with that of the
graceless. The wicked "spring as the grass," but "The righteous shall
flourish like the palm tree," whose growth may not be so rapid, but
whose endurance for centuries is in fine contrast with the transitory
verdure of the meadow. When we see a noble palm standing erect, sending
all its strength upward in one bold column, and growing amid the dearth
and drought of the desert, we have a fine picture of the godly man, who
in his uprightness aims alone at the glory of God; and, independent of
outward circumstances, is made by divine grace to live and thrive where
all things else perish. The text tells us not only what the righteous
is, but what he shall be; come what may, the good man shall flourish,
and flourish after the noblest manner. "He shall grow like a cedar in
Lebanon." This is another noble and long-lived tree. "As the days of a
tree are the days of my people," saith the Lord. On the summit of the
mountain, unsheltered from the blast, the cedar waves its mighty
branches in perpetual verdure, and so the truly godly man under all
adversities retains the joy of his soul, and continues to make progress
in the divine life. Grass, which makes hay for oxen, is a good enough
emblem of the unregenerate; but cedars, which build the temple of the
Lord, are none too excellent to set forth the heirs of heaven.

[Psa 92:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#013.md)

"Those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the
courts of our God." In the court-yards of Oriental houses trees were
planted, and being thoroughly screened, they would be likely to bring
forth their fruit to perfection in trying seasons; even so, those who by
grace are brought into communion with the Lord, shall be likened to
trees planted in the Lord's house, and shall find it good to their
souls. No heart has so much joy as that which abides in the Lord Jesus.
Fellowship with the stem begets fertility in the branches. If a man
abide in Christ he brings forth much fruit. Those professors who are
rooted to the world do not flourish; those who send forth their roots
into the marshes of frivolous pleasure cannot be in a vigorous
condition; but those who dwell in habitual fellowship with God shall
become men of full growth, rich in grace, happy in experience, mighty in
influence, honoured and honourable. Much depends upon the soil in which
a tree is planted; everything, in our case, depends upon our abiding in
the Lord Jesus, and deriving all our supplies from him. If we ever
really grow in the courts of the Lord's house we must be planted there,
for no tree grows in God's garden self-sown; once planted of the Lord,
we shall never be rooted up, but in his courts we shall take root
downward, and bring forth fruit upward to his glory for ever.

[Psa 92:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#014.md)

"They shall still bring forth fruit in old age." Nature decays but grace
thrives. Fruit, as far as nature is concerned, belongs to days of
vigour; but in the garden of grace, when plants are weak in themselves,
they become strong in the Lord, and abound in fruit acceptable with God.
Happy they who can sing this Sabbath Psalm, enjoying the rest which
breathes through every verse of it; no fear as to the future can
distress them, for their evil days, when the strong man faileth, are the
subject of a gracious promise, and therefore they await them with quiet
expectancy. Aged believers possess a ripe experience, and by their
mellow tempers and sweet testimonies they feed many. Even if bedridden,
they bear the fruit of patience; if poor and obscure, their lowly and
contented spirit becomes the admiration of those who know how to
appreciate modest worth. Grace does not leave the saint when the keepers
of the house do tremble; the promise is still sure though the eyes can
no longer read it; the bread of heaven is fed upon when the grinders
fail; and the voice of the Spirit in the soul is still melodious when
the daughters of music are brought low. Blessed be the Lord for this!
Because even to hoar hairs he is the I AM, who made his people, he
therefore bears and carries them.

"They shall be fat and flourishing." They do not drag out a wretched,
starveling existence, but are like trees full of sap, which bear
luxuriant foliage. God does not pinch his poor servants, and diminish
their consolations when their infirmities grow upon them; rather does he
see to it that they shall renew their strength, for their mouths shall
be satisfied with his own good things. Such an one as Paul the aged
would not ask our pity, but invite our sympathetic gratitude; however
feeble his outward man may be, his inner man is so renewed day by day
that we may well envy his perennial peace.

[Psa 92:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#015.md)

This mercy to the aged proves the faithfulness of their God, and leads
them "to shew that the Lord is upright" by their cheerful testimony to
his ceaseless goodness. We do not serve a Master who will run back from
his promise. Whoever else may defraud us, he never will. Every aged
Christian is a letter of commendation to the immutable fidelity of
Jehovah. "He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him." Here
is the Psalmist's own seal and sign manual: still was he building upon
his God, and still was the Lord a firm foundation for his trust. For
shelter, for defence, for indwelling, for foundation, God is our rock;
hitherto he has been to us all that he said he would be, and we may be
doubly sure that he will abide the same even unto the end. He has tricot
us, but he has never allowed us to be tempted above what we are able to
bear: he has delayed our reward, but he has never been unrighteous to
forget our work of faith and labour of love. He is a friend without
fault, a helper without fail. Whatever he may do with us, he is always
in the right; his dispensations have no flaw in them, no, not the most
minute. He is true and righteous altogether, and so we weave the end of
the Psalm with its beginning, and make a coronet of it, for the head of
our Beloved. "It is a good thing to sing praises unto the Lord," for "he
is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him."
