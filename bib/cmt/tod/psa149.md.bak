### [Psalms Chapter 149](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 149:0</span></span>

We are almost at the last Psalm, and still among the Hallelujahs. This
is "a new song," evidently intended for the new creation, and the men
who are of new heart. It is such a song as may be sung at the coming of
the Lord, when the new dispensation shall bring overthrow to the wicked
and honour to all the saints. The tone is exceedingly jubilant and
exultant. All through one hears the beat of the feet of dancing maidens,
keeping time to the timbrel and harp.

Hints to Preachers

[Psa 149:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#001.md). - "Praise ye the Lord."

I. The one work of a life.

II\. The work of the truly living of all degrees.

III\. Their work in many and various forms.

IV\. A work for which there is abundant cause, reason, and argument.

[Psa 149:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#001.md). -

I. A wonderful gift - to be a saint.

II\. A wonderful people - who are saints.

III\. A wonderful assembly - a congregation of saints.

IV\. A wonderful God - the object of their song.

[Psa 149:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#001.md), [Psa
149:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#002.md). - The new song of the saints.

I. The saints are God's children by the new birth.

II\. The new birth has given them a new heart.

III\. The new heart utters itself in a new song. - C. A. D.

[Psa 149:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#001.md), [Psa
149:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#005.md). -

I. We must praise God in public, "in the congregation of the saints":
the more the better; it is like to heaven.

II\. We must praise him in private. "Let the saints" be so transported
with their joy in God as to "sing aloud upon their beds," when they
awake in the night, as David; [Psa
119:62](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#062.md). - Matthew Henry.

[Psa 149:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#002.md). - The duty,
reasonableness, and benefit of holy joy.

[Psa 149:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#002.md). - A peculiar people, their
peculiar God, and their peculiar joy in him.

[Psa 149:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#002) (second clause.md). - Christ's
people may well rejoice: -

I. In the majesty of his person.

II\. In the righteousness of his rule.

III\. In the extent of his conquests.

IV\. In the protection they enjoy under him.

V. In the glory to which he will raise them. - From "The Homiletical
Library," 1882.

[Psa 149:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#002.md), [Psa
149:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#004.md). - The cause given to God's
Israel for Praise. Consider,

I. God's doings for them. They have reason to rejoice in God, and employ
themselves in his service; for it is he that "made" them.

II\. God's dominion over them. This follows upon the former: if he made
them he is their King.

III\. God's delight in them. He is a King that rules by love, and
therefore to be praised.

IV\. God's designs concerning them. Besides the present complacency he
hath in them, he hath prepared for their future glory. "He will beautify
the meek," etc. - Matthew Henry.

[Psa 149:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#004.md). - The text bears other
renderings. Head as in Authorized Version.

I. The character to be aimed at - "the meek."

1\. Submissive to God. To his truth. To his dealings.

2\. Gentle towards men. Bearing with patience. Forgiving with
heartiness. Loving with perseverance.

3\. Lowly in ourselves.

II\. The favour to be enjoyed - "beautify."

1\. The beauty of gentleness.

2\. The beauty of peace.

3\. The beauty of content.

I. A wonderful evidence of his grace.

II\. The highest honour they can desire.

III\. Their security for time and eternity. - J. F.

[Psa 149:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#005.md). - Saintly joy.

I. The state to which God has lifted the saints: "glory," in contrast
with sin, reproach, affliction.

II\. The emotion which accordingly befits the saints, "be joyful."

III\. The utterance of that emotion incumbent on the saints, "sing
aloud." - C. A. D.

[Psa 149:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#005) (second clause.md). - Let them
praise God -

I. Upon their beds of rest, upon their nightly couch.

1\. Because of what God has done for them during the day.

2\. Because sleep is the gift of God.

3\. Because they have a bed to lie upon.

4\. Because the Lord is their keeper ([Psa
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#005.md), [Psa
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#008).md).

II\. Upon their beds of sickness.

1\. Because it is God's will they should suffer.

2\. Because affliction is often a proof of God's love.

3\. Because, if sanctified, sickness is a great blessing.

4\. Because praise offered upon a bed of sickness is a testimony to the
power of religion.

III\. Upon their beds of death.

1\. Because the sting of death is removed.

2\. Because their Lord has passed through death.

3\. Because Christ is with them while they suffer.

Townsend.

[Psa 149:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#006.md). -

I. The Christian life a combination of adoration and conflict.

II\. In each case it should be at its best: "high praises, two-edged
sword."

III\. In each case holiness should be conspicuous: it is of saints that
the text speaks.

[Psa 149:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#008.md). - The restraining and
subduing power of the gospel.

[Psa 149:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#009.md). - The honour common to all
saints.

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Whole Psalm

The foregoing Psalm was a hymn of praise to the Creator; this is a hymn
to the Redeemer. - Matthew Henry.

Whole Psalm

The New Testament spiritual church cannot pray as the Old Testament
national church here prays. Under the illusion that it must be used as a
prayer without any spiritual transmutation, [Psa
149:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#001.md) has become the watchword of
the most horrible errors. It was by means of this Psalm that Caspar
Scloppius, in his Classicurn Belli Sacri, which, as Bakius says, is
written, not with ink, but with blood, inflamed the Roman Catholic
princes to the Thirty Years' Religious War. And in the Protestant church
Thomas Mntzer stirred up the War of the Peasants by means of this Psalm.
We see that the Christian cannot make such a Psalm directly his own,
without disavowing the apostolic warning, "The weapons of our warfare
are not carnal" ([Co2 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#004).md). The
praying Christian must therefore transpose the letter of this Psalm into
the spirit of the New Covenant. - Franz Delitzsch.

[Psa 149:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#001.md)

"A new song"; for this Psalm is a song of renovation. If Israel when
restored and renewed had new cause for rejoicing, much more should the
New Covenant Israel feel constrained to strike the new note of triumph.
Infidels blaspheme, the ungrateful murmur, the thoughtless are silent,
the mournful weep, all acting according to their old nature; but new men
take up a new mode, which is the divinely-inspired song of peace,
charity, and joy in the Lord. - Johannes Paulus Palanterius.

[Psa 149:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#001.md)

"A new song." - The old man hath an old song, the new man a new song.
The Old Testament is an old song, the New Testament is a new song.....
Whoso loveth earthly things singeth an old song: let him that desireth
to sing a new song love the things of eternity. Love itself is new and
eternal; therefore is it ever new, because it never groweth old. -
Augustine.

[Psa 149:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#001.md)

"Saints." - A title not to be restricted to the godly of the first
times, but common to all that are saved in all after-times also, as [Eph
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#012.md). This name putteth mere morality
and formal profession out of countenance, as the sun doth a glow-worm.
Saintship is a matter of Divine workmanship, and therefore it is far
more remarkable than human excellence. We should keep up the name of
"saints," that the reality of the true religion be not lowered by
avoiding this title; for in these times it is to be feared that the name
is out of use, because holiness itself is out of fashion. - Thomas
Goodwin.

[Psa 149:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#002.md)

"Let Israel rejoice," etc. Give us, oh, give us the man who sings at his
work! Be his occupation what it may, he is equal to any of those who
follow the same pursuit in silent sullenness. He will do more in the
same time - he will do it better - he will persevere longer. One is
scarcely sensible of fatigue whilst he marches to music. The very stars
are said to make harmony as they revolve in their spheres. Wondrous is
the strength of cheerfulness, altogether past calculation its powers of
endurance. Efforts to be permanently useful must be uniformly joyous - a
spiritual sunshine - graceful from very gladness - beautiful because
bright. - Thomas Carlyle.

[Psa 149:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#002.md)

"Rejoice in him that made him: let the children of Zion be joyful." You
are never right until you can be heartily merry in the Lord, nor until
you can enjoy mirth in connection with holiness. - Walter Marshall.

[Psa 149:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#002.md)

"Him that made him." Jehovah is called Maker, as one who formed Israel
as a nation, and constituted the people a kingdom, though they had been
a race of slaves. This is more than a general creation of men. - Hermann
Venema.

[Psa 149:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#002.md)

Literally the Hebrew here brings forward the mystic doctrine of the
Trinity, for it reads, "Let Israel rejoice in God his Makers." - Simon
de Muis.

[Psa 149:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#002.md)

"Joyful in their King." I beg the reader to remark with me, here is
nothing said of Israel being joyful in what their king had done for
them. These things in their proper place, became sweet subjects of
praise. But the subject of praise in which Israel is now to be engaged
is Jesus himself. Reader, pause over this apparently small, but most
important, distinction. The Lord is gracious in his gifts, gracious in
his love, gracious in his salvation. Every thing he gives, it is from
his mercy, and ever to be so acknowledged. But Jesus' gifts are not
himself: I cannot be satisfied with his gifts, while I know that to
others he gives his Person. It is Jesus himself I want. Though he give
me all things that I need, yet if he be to me himself all things that I
need, in him I have all things. Hence, therefore, let us see that Jesus
not only gives us all, but that he is our all. - Robert Hawker.

[Psa 149:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#003.md)

"The dance" was in early times one of the modes of expressing religious
joy ([Exo 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020.md); [Sa2
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#016).md). When from any cause men's ideas
shall undergo such a revolution as to lead them to do the same thing for
the same purpose, it will be time enough to discuss that matter. In our
time, dancing has no such use, and cannot, therefore, in any wise be
justified by pleading the practice of pious Jews of old. - William Swan
Plumer.

[Psa 149:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#003.md)

"Let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp." They who
from hence urge the use of music in religious worship, must, by the same
rule, introduce dancing, for they went together, as in David's dancing
before the ark ([Jdg 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#021).md). But
whereas many Scriptures in the New Testament keep up singing as a gospel
ordinance, none provide for the keeping up of music and dancing; the
gospel canon for Psalmody is to "sing with the spirit and with the
understanding." - Matthew Henry.

[Psa 149:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#003.md)

"Timbrel." The toph was employed by David in all the festivities of
religion ([Sa2 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#005).md). The occasions on
which it was used were mostly joyful, and those who played upon it were
generally females ([Psa 68:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#025).md), as was
the case among most ancient nations, and is so at the present day in the
East. The usages of the modern East might adequately illustrate all the
scriptural allusions to this instrument, but happily we have more
ancient and very valuable illustration from the monuments of Egypt. In
these we find that the tambourine was a favourite instrument, both on
sacred and festive occasions. There were three kinds, differing, no
doubt, in sound as well as in form; one was circular, another square or
oblong, and the third consisted of two squares separated by a bar. They
were all beaten by the hand, and often used as an accomplishment to the
harp and other instruments. The tambourine was usually played by
females, who are represented as dancing to its sound without the
accompaniment of any other instrument. - John Kitto.

[Psa 149:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#003.md)

"Harp." Of the kinnor the Scripture affords little further information
than that it was composed of the sounding parts of good wood, and
furnished with strings. Josephus asserts that it was furnished with ten
strings, and played with a plectrum; which, however, is not understood
to imply that it never had any other number of strings, or was always
played with the plectrum. David certainly played it with the hand ([Sa1
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#023.md); [Sa1
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#010.md); [Sa1
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#009).md); and it was probably used in
both ways, according to its size. That this instrument was really a harp
is now very generally denied (Kitto). The reader will, by this time,
have balanced the probabilities as to the nature and construction of the
kinnor; and most likely he will be led to think that it was either a
guitar or lyre, a belief which seems to be gaining ground, on account of
the aptitude of such instruments for the uses to which the kinnor was
devoted. - J. Stainer.

[Psa 149:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#004.md)

"For the Lord taketh pleasure in his people." In the text there are two
causes assigned why the saints should be excited to praise the Lord, and
to be joyful in their King.

I. The delight which the Lord has in the saints. "He taketh pleasure in
his people." In this statement there are three subjects for inquiry,
namely - 1. Who are the Lord's people? 2. Why he takes pleasure in them?
3. In what respects he takes pleasure in them?

1\. Who are the Lord's people? Many are the names and titles given to
them in Scripture. We find one in the second clause of the text; but it
equally belongs to the first. "He will beautify the meek." The
scriptural term "meekness" is one which singularly characterizes and
distinguishes the true Christian. It, in fact, contains in itself a
combination of graces, which are most evidently the fruit of the Spirit,
and can grow on no other tree than on the Christian vine. Meekness, as a
Christian grace, may be considered as it respects both God and man. As
it respects God, it implies poverty of spirit; humiliation of heart
arising from a sense of guilt and a feeling of corruption; submission to
God's will; silence and patience under his rod; acquiescence with his
dispensations; and a surrender of our own natural desires and
inclinations to his overruling appointments. As it respects man,
meekness comprehends lowliness of mind, and a readiness to prefer others
before ourselves; gentleness of disposition and behaviour; forbearance
under provocations; forgiveness of injuries' quietness of spirit, and
moderation in pushing forward our own interest and benefit. These are
the qualities which distinguish "the meek." Are not these, my brethren,
the graces and tempers and dispositions which characterize and adorn
true Christians? They are, in an especial manner, "the meek upon earth."
In fact, there are, and can be, no others to whom this title really
belongs. No man in his natural state can be meek, in the Scriptural
sense of the word.

2\. But why does the Lord "take pleasure" in them? Is there anything in
them of their own, which he can regard with complacency and delight? No,
they know and feel that they have no pretensions of this kind. It is not
for their sake, but for his own sake; for his name's, his truth's, and
his mercy's sake, that he has now a favour unto them. The Lord "taketh
pleasure in his people," because they are his people; those whom he has
purchased by his blood, renewed by his Spirit, and redeemed by his
power. He "taketh pleasure in them," because in them he is himself
honoured and glorified; because he sees in them the travail of his soul,
the fruit of his suffering and mediation; because of the work which he
has already begun in them; because they already exhibit some traces of
his own image, some transcript of that mind which was in him, who was
"meek and lowly in heart."

3\. In what respects the Lord takes pleasure in his people. First, the
Lord takes pleasure in them, inasmuch as he delights in the exercise of
their graces towards him. They all believe in him, and have faith in his
word and promises; they rely on his truth and power; they hope in his
mercy; they fear his displeasure; they love his person and name.
Secondly, the Lord hath pleasure in the services of his people. It is
true, that they can do but little for him, and that little is nothing
worth. At the best they can but render to him of his own again. But he
regards their services, not with an eye to their intrinsic value in
themselves, but for the sake of the willing mind from which they flow.
He takes pleasure in their poor attempts to please him, because they are
attempts. He weighs not the worth or merit of the action, but the
principle and motive from which it springs. Thirdly: the Lord hath
pleasure in the prosperity of his people. His name is love; his nature
is goodness; and can we doubt but that he loves to see his people happy?
Nay, we are expressly told that "he rejoiceth over them with joy"; that
"he rejoiceth over them to do them good." Even in those dispensations
which in themselves are grievous and painful he is seeking their good,
and in the end promoting their happiness. What consolations do these
reflections furnish to the meek and suffering servants of the Lord!

II\. Let us now consider the lord's gracious designs concerning his
people, "He will beautify them with salvation." He designs not only to
save, but to adorn and honour his people. Those "whom he justifies, them
he also glorifies." He "will beautify them with salvation"; a promise
relating both to the present life and to the future one.

1\. A. To the present life. It is the purpose of God to beautify his
people with salvation in this world. There are many passages in the
Scripture which intimate this purpose, and lead us to this view of the
happy effects of religion, even in the present life. When the prodigal
returned home to his father's house, contrite, penitent, and reformed,
he was not only received with kindness, assured of forgiveness, and
welcomed as a son, but he was adorned and beautified ([Luk
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#022).md). So in the forty-fifth Psalm,
the Church, the bride of Christ, is thus described. "The king's daughter
is all glorious within her clothing is of wrought gold. She shall be
brought unto the king in raiment of needlework." "So shall he greatly
desire thy beauty." See also [Eph
5:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025.md).

2\. But what is the glory, the beauty, which is here meant in these
passages, with which Christ will adorn and beautify his people? It is
"the beauty of holiness." We have already seen that the meek and quiet
spirit by which the Christian is distinguished is an "ornament" to him;
and we read in another place that he is "adorned" with good works. It is
the great object of the gospel to sanctify all who embrace it, to
restore them to the image of God which they have lost through sin.

3\. B. We may now consider this promise as it relates to the future
world. Lovely and glorious as are the saints on earth, their beauty
falls far short of the perfection to which it will attain hereafter.
They are "predestinated to be conformed to the image of his Son"; and
when they awake up in another world, it will be after his likeness,
without any remaining blemish, defect or spot. Carry forward your
thoughts to the morning of the resurrection, when this corruption shall
have put on incorruption, this mortal immortality; when the body, raised
in honour and glory, shall be clothed in its beauteous apparel, and
being made like unto Christ's glorious body, shall shine as the sun in
the firmament; when now, once more united to its kindred and sanctified
spirit, it shall no longer be a weight, and a clog, and a hindrance, but
become a furtherer of its joy, and a sharer and a helper in its
spiritual happiness. This is the meaning of the text, this is the beauty
which he has designed for his people, and for which he is now preparing
them. In the contemplation of these, with reason may it be said to them,
"Praise ye the Lord." - Condensed from a Sermon by Edward Cooper, 1826.

[Psa 149:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#004.md)

Here in ratio propositionis, the important reason of the proposed
praising of the Lord. Those who know that they are objects of Divine
complacency are likely to act on the principle of reciprocity. God takes
pleasure in sanctifying, justifying and glorifying them; they must
surely take pleasure in extolling him as Friend, Protector, Law-giver,
Leader, King, God! - Simon de Muis.

[Psa 149:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#004.md)

"He will beautify the meek with salvation." Meekness not only gives
great peace of mind, but often adds a lustre to the countenance. We only
read of three in Scripture whose faces shone remarkably - viz., Christ,
Moses, and Stephen - and they were eminent for meekness. - Matthew
Henry.

[Psa 149:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#004.md)

"The meek." In the Hebrew ענוים, anavim, means poor and afflicted ones;
but the term came afterwards to be applied to merciful persons, as
bodily afflictions have a tendency to subdue pride, while abundance
begets cruelty. - John Calvin.

[Psa 149:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#005.md)

"Let the saints be joyful," etc. Here begins a beautiful exegesis of the
former passage. A protected people may rejoice with confidence. An
anxious and fearful people could not sing aloud on their couches of
repose. - Simon de Muis.

[Psa 149:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#005.md)

"Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their
beds." At what time soever God is pleased to inspire his grace and
comfort into us, we ought to rejoice therein, and by night on the bed to
seek him whom our soul loveth; abridging that time of rest and ease,
that it may become as beneficial unto us as the day itself. David was
not satisfied by offering the sacrifice of thanksgiving in the courts of
the Lord's house, and paying his vows in the presence of all the people;
but in the night also he would continue his song of God's mercy. Like
that excellent bird, the nightingale, which is never weary nor spent by
continuing her delightful notes, so this sweet singer of Israel was
incessant in praising the Lord; not giving sleep to his eyes until he
had blessed his holy name. In time of affliction he made his bed to
swim, praying unto the Lord to return and deliver his soul. Now in
prosperity he gives thanks for the blessings he doth receive. When our
bones are vexed, and our sleep departeth from us, we pray unto God to
deal mercifully with us; but when our diseases are healed, we do not
return thanks, being soon overtaken with heaviness and security. And yet
David did endeavour to watch in the night, that he might sing praise
unto the Lord. He did not then only meditate in the law of God, when he
could not take any rest (as Ahasuerus had the book of the records of the
Chronicles read before him, when he could not sleep); for now he might
lie down in peace, and sleep, when God made him to dwell in safety. Much
less did he intend to procure sleep by a sinister performance of any
good duty, like those who, by singing, or reading, or hearing, or
meditating will have an unworthy aim to bring themselves asleep. David
saith, "Let the saints sing aloud upon their beds": thereby to testify
their cheerful devotion, and also to chase away the spirit of slumber. -
William Bloys, in "Meditations upon the 42nd Psalm," 1632.

[Psa 149:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#005.md)

"The saints in glory" shall rest from their labours, but not from their
praises. - Robert Bellarmine.

[Psa 149:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#005.md)

"Upon their beds," where before in the loneliness of night they consumed
themselves with grief for their shame. Comp. [Hos
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#014.md). - E. W. Hengstenberg.

[Psa 149:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#005.md)

The saints of God know most of domestic joy and peace. As the word of
Jesus in John 14 records, they have sorrows in plenty, but the more of
these, the greater will be their joy, because their sorrows are to be
transmuted into joys. They are to sing aloud "on their beds," or rather
couches, for on these the Orientals not only sleep, but also dine, and
feast. So this verse calls on the saints to hold a banquet, a feast of
fat things. They are, as David sings in [Psa
23:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001.md), to sit at the table prepared
by the Lord in the presence of their enemies. - Johannes Paulus
Palanterius.

[Psa 149:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#005.md)

This verse has been fulfilled in solemn crises of saintly life. On beds
of death, and at the scaffold and the stake, joy and glory have been
kindled in the hearts of Christ's faithful witnesses. - Thomas Le Blanc.

[Psa 149:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#005.md)

How I long for my bed! Not that I may sleep - I lie awake often and long
I but to hold sweet communion with my God. What shall I render unto him
for all his revelations and gifts to me? Were there no historical
evidence of the truth of Christianity, were there no well-established
miracles, still I should believe that the religion propagated by the
fishermen of Galilee is divine. The holy Joys it brings to me must be
from heaven Do I write this boastingly, brother? Nay, it is with tears
of humble gratitude that I tell of the goodness of the Lord. - From a
private letter from Bapa Padmanji, in "Feathers for Arrows," 1870.

[Psa 149:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#006.md)

"Let the high praises of God be in their mouth and a two-edged sword in
their hand." Praise and power go ever hand in hand. The two things act
and react upon each other. An era of spiritual force in the Church is
always one of praise; and when there comes some grand outburst of sacred
song, we may expect that the people of God are entering upon some new
crusade for Christ. Cromwell's Ironsides were sneeringly called
Psalm-singers; but God's Psalm-singers are always Ironsides. He who has
a "new song in his mouth" is ever stronger, both to suffer and to
labour, than the man who has a dumb spirit and a hymnless heart. When he
sings at his work, he will both do more and do it better than he would
without his song. Hence, we need not be surprised that all through its
history the Church of God has travelled "along the line of music" -
William Taylor, in "The Study," 1873.

[Psa 149:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#006.md)

"The high praises of God." This expression needs a little explication,
because so variously rendered by most interpreters; some rendering it
only, exaltations of God; others, praisings exalting God; others,
sublime praises of God; others, praises highly uttered unto God, the
reason whereof is, because the word romemoth in the text signifies
sometimes actively, and then it notes the height, exaltation, and
lifting up of anything to the observation of others; and sometimes
passively, and then it notes the height, worth, excellency of the thing
that is exalted, or lifted up, in itself. But the scope and nature of
the duty prescribed in the text necessarily comprehends both - as well
the high acts for which God is to be praised, as the high praises to be
given unto God for those high acts; but especially the latter, namely,
the height and excellency of the duty of praise to be performed for
those high acts of God. This appears from the whole argument of the
Psalm, which is entirely laudatory, as also from the instrument
wherewith these high praises are to be performed, namely, the "mouth,
the high praises of God in their mouth"; showing that the height herein
mentioned is a property of man's work in praising God, and not only for
the work of God, for which he is to be praised. In my observations I
shall comprehend both, and all the particulars in the duty prescribed
besides, which is this -

The duty of praising God is a high duty, which must exalt and lift up
the high God in it.

This truth I shall labour to demonstrate, 1. From the Object. 2. The
Effect. 3. Their Price. 4. Their Performance; or, to use the School
terms, they are "high" 1. Objective. 2. Effective. 3. Appreciative. 4.
Perfective.

I. The praises of God are "high" in relation to their Object, which is
none other but the Most High God, and that in the consideration of his
transcendent height and sublimity over and above all other things or
persons: so the Psalmist's resolution intimates ([Psa
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#017).md), "I will praise the Lord
according to his righteousness," which he expresseth in the following
words, "To sing praise to the name of the Lord most high"; and [Psa
92:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#001.md). I: "It is a good thing to
give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most
High." In which places, and very many more in the Scriptures, it is
evident that the Lord, considered in his highest sublimity, is the
object of high praise, and that by most special and peculiar
appropriation of it unto himself, and none other ([Isa
42:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#008).md).

II\. In the second place, the praises of God will appear to be of a
high, sublime nature, from the high effect, the genuine and proper fruit
they produce, viz., that although their object to whom they are
peculiarly appropriate (I mean the Lord himself) be in his own nature,
and of himself, most infinitely high and transcendent, yet by the
attribution and performance of praise unto him, doth he account his
name, his power, his wisdom, and justice, and himself to be exalted
thereby. What else do those expressions in Scripture imply wherein it is
asserted, that by this high duty of praise the high Jehovah is exalted
([Psa 108:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#005).md); His sublime perfections
are extolled and lifted up ([Psa
68:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#004).md): His great Name is magnified
([Luk 1:64](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#064).md); His infinite majesty is
glorified ([Psa 50:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#023).md)? Oh how high
must be that duty, that adds height to the high God, that magnifies the
great God, and glorifies the God of glory, and makes him higher,
greater, and more glorious than he was before!

III\. Thirdly, the praises of God are of a high nature, appreciative, in
respect of the high estimation the Lord himself hath of them, which
appears two ways:

1\. By the high price wherewith he purchaseth them;

2\. By the high delight he takes in them, after he hath procured them.

First. The price wherewith God is willing to purchase them is very high,
for not only the expense of all his wisdom, power, and goodness, put
forth in creation, not only the layings out of all his counsel, care,
love, and faithfulness in providence and preservation; but also the rich
treasure of his promises, covenant, grace, yea, the precious blood of
his own Son, in our redemption, is given freely, absolutely,
intentionally, and ultimately, for no other thing but the purchase of
high praises to God ([Eph 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#005.md), [Eph
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006).md). All that God doth and giveth;
all that Christ doth and suffereth, is for the praise of the glory of
his grace. I confess, consider men's highest praises of God, as they are
man's performance, they are poor and inconsiderable things; but consider
them as they are the testimonies and expressions of a believing heart,
declaring and making known the unspeakable wisdom, faithfulness, bounty,
and excellencies of God, exercised in his works; in this notion the
Scripture declares the heart of God to be so taken with the desire of
them, that he is willing to give heaven, earth, Himself, and Son to poor
men for the praises of their hearts, hands, and tongues and accounts
himself abundantly satisfied. Therefore, when his people will speak good
of his name, they speak of him in the dialect of angels' notes, "the
high praises of God."

Secondly. The high value that God hath of "high praises" will be evident
by the high delight and pleasure God takes in them thus purchased; for
skilful artists, and high-principled, elevated understandings, never
take pleasure or delight in any thing or work which is not answerable to
their highest principles, and proportionable to their uttermost skill
and desire. Now the Lord, who is of the most perfect understanding, and
deepest skill and knowledge, declares himself to take infinite delight
in his people's praises. It is his solace and pleasure to be attended
with them, either in earth or in heaven, by men or angels; and his soul
is ravished with the thoughts and contemplation of them.

IV\. In the fourth place, the praises of God are high, and of a high
nature perfectiv, that is, in respect of the high measure of grace they
are to be attended withal in their performance: the Lord requiring the
duty of high praise to be performed with a great measure of
Scripture-light, with a high degree of effectual faith, and with a more
ample proportion of practical holiness than any other of the most solemn
exercises of his public worship. - Condensed from a Sermon by Samuel
Fairclough, entitled "The Prisoner's Praise," 1650.

[Psa 149:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#008.md)

"To bind their kings with chains," etc. Agrippa was captive to Paul. The
word had him in bands like a prisoner, and made him confess against
himself before Festus that he was "almost persuaded to be a Christian."
Then it was verified which before was prophesied, "They shall bind kings
in chains, and nobles in fetters of iron." Oh, the majesty and force of
the word! - Henry Smith.

[Psa 149:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#008.md)

It was once the saying of Pompey, that with one stamp of his foot he
could raise all Italy up in arms; and the mighty men of the world may
have nations, kingdoms, and commonwealths at their command, but yet God
is more powerful than they all. If he do but arise, they shall all of
them fly before him. If he once fall to fettering of princes, it shall
be done so sure, that no flesh shall be able to knock off their bolts
again. - Stephen Gosson, 1554-1623.

[Psa 149:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#009.md)

"This honour have all his saints." All other glories and honours are but
feminine, weak, poor things to it. God is their glory; honoured they are
with his blessed presence, honoured with his sight, with his embraces;
they see him and enjoy him. This is the very glory of their honour, the
height and pitch of all, for "in thy presence is joy, and at thy right
hand there is pleasure for evermore," honour advanced into eternal
glory; and "this honour" also "have all his saints"; some in spe, and
some in re, some in hope, and some in deed; all either in promise or in
possession. - Mark Frank.

[Psa 149:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#009.md)

"This honour have all his saints." "His saints" emphatically; Divine
providence foreseeing that in after ages some would usurp the title of
saintship to whom it did not belong. "His saints" exclusively; casting
out saint traitors, as Beckett and Garnet; saint hypocrites, and many
others; who, in the same sense as auri sacra fames, may be termed sacri,
or sancti, saints. But, what honour have all his saints? Mark what went
before - "as it is written"; but by whom, and where? Though chapters and
verses be of later date, the Holy Spirit might have cited the book. O
no! He, to quicken our industry, refers us to the Word at large.
However, "search the Scriptures," and therein we shall meet with many
honours afforded to the saints; both whilst they were living, and when
they were dead.

Honour to their memories is sometimes paid them very abundantly, even by
those who formerly were so niggardly and covetous as not to afford them
a good word in their lifetime.

Many are made converts by the godly ends of good men; as the centurion
himself, who attended and ordered the crucifying of Christ, after his
expiring broke forth into that testimony of him, - "Verily, this was the
Son of God." So, such as rail at, revile, curse, condemn, persecute,
execute pious people, speak other language of them when such men have
passed the purgation of death, and confess them faithful and sincere
servants of God.

The last "honour" is imitation of their virtuous examples. The Papists
brag that Stapleton, their great controversial divine, was born on that
very day whereon Sir Thomas More was put to death; but Providence so
ordereth it that out of the ashes of dead saints many living ones do
spring and sprout, by following the pious precedents of such godly
persons deceased. - Thomas Fuller, in "Abel Redivivus.

[Psalms 149:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 149:1</span></span>

1 Praise ye the Lord. Sing unto the Lord a new song, and his praise in
the congregation of saints.

2 Let Israel rejoice in him that made him - let the children of Zion be
joyful in their King.

3 Let them praise his name in the dance - let them sing praises unto him
with the timbrel and harp.

4 For the Lord taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek
with salvation.

5 Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their
beds.

6 Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged sword
in their hand;

7 To execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the
people;

8 To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of
iron;

9 To execute upon them the judgment written - this honour have all his
saints. Praise ye the Lord.

[Psa 149:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#001.md)

"Praise ye the Lord." Specially you, ye chosen people, whom he has made
to be his saints. You have praised him aforetime, praise him yet again;
yea, for ever praise him. With renewed zeal and fresh delight lift up
your song unto Jehovah. "Sing unto the Lord a new song." Sing, for it is
the fittest method for expressing reverent praise. Sing a hymn newly
composed, for you have now a new knowledge of God. He is ever new in his
manifestations; his mercies are new every morning; his deliverances are
new in every night of sorrow; let your gratitude and thanksgivings be
new also. It is well to repeat the old; it is more useful to invent the
new. Novelty goes well with heartiness. Our singing should be "unto the
Lord"; the songs we sing should be of him and to him, "for of him, and
to him, and through him are all things." Among our novelties there
should be new songs: alas! men are fonder of making new complaints than
new Psalms. Our new songs should be devised in Jehovah's honour; indeed
all our newest thoughts should run towards him. Never can we find a
nobler subject for a song than the Lord, nor one more full of fresh
matter for a new song, nor one which we are personally so much bound to
sing as a new song "unto the Lord." "And his praise in the congregation
of saints." Saints are precious, and a congregation of saints is a
treasure house of jewels. God is in the midst of saints, and because of
this we may well long to be among them. They are so full of his praise
that we feel at home among them when we are ourselves full of praise.
The sanctuary is the house of praise as well as the house of prayer. All
saints praise God: they would not be saints if they did not. Their
praise is sincere, suitable, seasonable, and acceptable. Personal praise
is sweet unto God, but congregated praise has a multiplicity of
sweetnesses in it. When holy ones meet, they adore the Holy One. Saints
do not gather to amuse themselves with music, nor to extol one another,
but to sing his praise whose saints they are. A congregation of saints
is heaven upon earth: should not Jehovah, the Lord of saints, have all
the praise that can come from such an assembly? Yet at times even
saintly conclaves need to be stirred up to thanksgiving; for saints may
be sad and apprehensive, and then their spirits require to be raised to
a higher key, and stimulated to happier worship.

[Psa 149:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#002.md)

"Let Israel rejoice in him that made him." Here is that new creation
which calls for the new song. It was Jehovah who made Israel to be
Israel, and the tribes to become a great nation: therefore let the
Founder of the nation be had in perpetual honour. Joy and rejoicing are
evidently to be the special characteristics of the new song. The
religion of the dead in sin is more apt to chant dirges than to sing
hallelujahs; but when we are made new in the spirit of our minds we joy
and rejoice in him that made us. Our joy is in our God and King: we
choose no lower delight. "Let the children of Zion be joyful in their
King." Those who had seen the tribes formed into a settled kingdom as
well as into a united nation should rejoice. Israel is the nation, Zion
is the capital of the kingdom, Israel rejoices in her Maker, Zion in her
King. In the case of our God we who believe in him are as glad of his
Government as we are of his Creation: his reign is as truly the making
of us as was his divine power. The children of Israel are happy to be
made a people; the children of Zion are equally happy to be ruled as a
people. In every character our God is the source of joy to us: this
verse issues a permit to our joy, yea it lays an injunction upon us to
be glad in the Lord.

[Psa 149:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#003.md)

"Let them praise his name in the dance, let them sing praises unto him
with the timbrel and harp." Thus let them repeat the triumph of the Red
Sea, which was ever the typical glory of Israel. Miriam led the
daughters of Israel in the dance when the Lord had triumphed gloriously;
was it not most fit that she should? The sacred dance of devout joy is
no example, nor even excuse, for frivolous dances, much less for lewd
ones. Who could help dancing when Egypt was vanquished, and the tribes
were free? Every mode of expressing delight was bound to be employed on
so memorable an occasion. Dancing, singing, and playing on instruments
were all called into requisition, and most fitly so. There are unusual
seasons which call for unusual expressions of joy. When the Lord saves a
soul its holy joy overflows, and it cannot find channels enough for its
exceeding gratitude: if the man does not leap, or play, or sing, at any
rate he praises God, and wishes for a thousand tongues with which to
magnify his Saviour. Who would wish it to be otherwise? Young converts
are not to be restrained in their joy. Let them sing and dance while
they can. How can they mourn now that their Bridegroom is with them? Let
us give the utmost liberty to joy. Let us never attempt its suppression,
but issue in the terms of this verse a double license for exultation. If
any ought to be glad it is the children of Zion; rejoicing is more fit
for Israel than for any other people: it is their own folly and fault
that they are not oftener brimming with joy in God, for the very thought
of him is delight.

[Psa 149:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#004.md)

"For the Lord taketh pleasure in his people;" and therefore they should
take pleasure in him. If our joy be pleasing to him let us make it full.
What condescension is this on Jehovah's part, to notice, to love, and to
delight in his chosen! Surely there is nothing in our persons, or our
actions, which could cause pleasure to the Ever-blessed One, were it not
that he condescends to men of low estate. The thought of the Lord's
taking pleasure in us is a mine of joy never to be exhausted. "He will
beautify the meek with salvation." They are humble, and feel their need
of salvation; he is gracious, and bestows it upon them. They lament
their deformity and he puts a beauty upon them of the choicest sort. He
saves them by sanctifying them, and thus they wear the beauty of
holiness, and the beauty of a joy which springs out of full salvation.
He makes his people meek, and then makes the meek beautiful. Herein is
grand argument for worshipping the Lord with the utmost exultation: he
who takes such a pleasure in us must be approached with every token of
exceeding joy.

God taketh pleasure in all his children as Jacob loved all his sons; but
the meek are his Josephs, and upon these he puts the coat of many
colours, beautifying them with peace, content, joy, holiness, and
influence. A meek and quiet spirit is called "an ornament," and
certainly it is "the beauty of holiness." When God himself beautifies a
man, he becomes beautiful indeed and beautiful for ever.

The verse may be read, "He shall beautify the meek with salvation," or
"He shall beautify the afflicted with deliverance," or, "He shall
beautify the meek with victory"; and each of these readings gives a new
shade of meaning, well worthy of quiet consideration. Each reading also
suggests new cause for joyful adoration. "O come, let us sing unto the
Lord."

[Psa 149:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#005.md)

"Let the saints be joyful in glory." God has honoured them, and put a
rare glory upon them; therefore let them exult therein. Shall those to
whom God is their glory be cast down and troubled? Nay, let their joy
proclaim their honourable estate. "Let them sing aloud upon their beds."
Their exultation should express itself in shouts and songs, for it is
not a feeling of which they have any need to be ashamed. That which is
so fully justified by fact, may well be loudly proclaimed. Even in their
quietest retreats let them burst into song; when no one hears them, let
them sing aloud unto God. If confined by sickness let them joy in God.
In the night watches let them not lie awake and weep, but like
nightingales let them charm the midnight hours. Their shouts are not now
for the battlefield, but for the places of their rest, they can
peacefully lie down and yet enjoy the victory with which the Lord has
beautified them. Without fighting, faith wins and sings the victory.
What a blessing to have our beds made into thrones, and our retirements
turned into triumphs!

[Psa 149:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#006.md)

"Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in
their hand." It seems they are not always on their beds, but are ready
for deeds of prowess. When called to fight, the meek are very hard to
overcome; they are just as steady in conflict as they are steadfast in
patience. Besides, their way of fighting is of an extraordinary sort,
for they sing to God but keep their swords in their hands. They can do
two things at a time: if they do not wield the trowel and the sword, at
least they sing and strike. In this Israel was not an example, but a
type: we will not copy the chosen people in making literal war, but we
will fulfil the emblem by carrying on spiritual war. We praise God and
contend with our corruptions; we sing joyfully and war earnestly with
evil of every kind. Our weapons are not carnal, but they are mighty, and
wound with both back and edge. The word of God is all edge; whichever
way we turn it, it strikes deadly blows at falsehood and wickedness. If
we do not praise we shall grow sad in our conflict; and if we do not
fight we shall become presumptuous in our song. The verse indicates a
happy blending of the chorister and the crusader.

Note how each thing in the believer is emphatic: if he sings, it is high
praises, and praises deep down in his throat, as the original hath it;
and if he fights, it is with the sword, and the sword is two-edged. The
living God imparts vigorous life to those who trust him. They are not of
a neutral tint men both hear them and feel them. Quiet is their spirit,
but in that very quietude abides the thunder of an irresistible force.
When godly men give battle to the powers of evil each conflict is high
praise unto the God of goodness. Even the tumult of our holy war is a
part of the music of our lives.

[Psa 149:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#007.md)

"To execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the
people." This was once literally the duty of Israel: when they came into
Canaan they fulfilled the righteous sentence of the Lord upon guilty
nations. At this hour, under the gentler dispensation of grace, we
wrestle not with flesh and blood; yet is our warfare none the less stem,
and our victory none the less sure. All evil shall eventually be
overthrown, the Lord shall display his justice against evil-doers, and
in that warfare his servants shall play their parts. The saints shall
judge the world. Both the conflict and the victory at the end of it
shall cause glory to God, and honour to his holy ones.

[Psa 149:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#008.md)

"To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of
iron." Thus are the greatest enemies of Jehovah and his people reduced
to shame, rendered helpless, and themselves punished. This was Israel's
boast in actual fact, it is ours spiritually. The chief powers of evil
shall be restrained and ultimately destroyed. Those who made captives of
the godly shall themselves be made captive. The powers of evil cannot
bind our King, but by his power their king shall be bound with a great
chain, and shut up in the bottomless pit, that he may at length be
trodden under the feet of saints.

[Psa 149:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#009.md)

"To execute upon them the judgment written." Israel as a nation had this
to do, and did it, and then they rejoiced in the God who gave success to
their arms. We praise our God after another fashion; we are not
executioners of justice, but heralds of mercy. It would be a sad thing
for any one to misuse this text: lest any warlike believer should be led
to do so, we would remind him that the execution must not go beyond the
sentence and warrant; and we have received no warrant of execution
against our fellow men. Christians have no commission of vengeance; it
is theirs to execute the command of mercy, and that alone. "This honour
have all his saints." All the godly shared in the triumphs of the Lord
when he smote Israel's foes. We have like honour, but it is shown in
victories of another sort. All the holy ones are sent upon errands by
their holy Lord. The honours described in this Psalm are common to all
the family of grace; and such service as the Lord appoints is to be
undertaken by every one of them, without exception. The Lord honours all
his chosen here, and he will glorify them all hereafter: this rule is
without exception. Surely in this we have the best argument for
glorifying the Lord, wherefore we close our new song with another
Hallelujah, "Praise ye the Lord."
