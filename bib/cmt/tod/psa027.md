### [Psalms Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 27:0</span></span>

Title and Subject - Nothing whatever can be drawn from the title as to
the time when this Psalm was written, for the heading, "A Psalm of
David," is common to so many of the Psalms; but if one may judge from
the matter of the song, the writer was pursued by enemies, [Psa
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#002.md) and [Psa
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#003.md), was shut out from the house of
the Lord, [Psa 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004.md), was last parting
from father and mother, [Psa 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#010.md),
and was subject to slander, [Psa
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#012.md); do not all these meet in the
time when Doeg, the Edomite, spake against him to Saul? It is a song of
cheerful hope, well fitted for those in trial who have learned to lean
upon the Almighty arm. The Psalm may with profit be read in a threefold
way, as the language of David, of the Church, and of the Lord Jesus. The
plenitude of Scripture will thus appear the more wonderful.

Division - The poet first sounds forth his sure confidence in his God,
[Psa 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001.md), and his love of communion
with him, [Psa 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004.md). He then betakes
himself to prayer, [Psa 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#007.md), and
concludes with an acknowledgment of the sustaining power of faith in his
own case, and an exhortation to others to follow his example.

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

[Psa 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001.md)

"The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?" Alice
Driver, martyr, at her examination, put all the doctors to silence, so
that they had not a word to say, but one looked upon another; then she
said, "Have you no more to say? God be honoured, you be not able to
resist the Spirit of God, in me, a poor woman. I was an honest poor
man's daughter, never brought up at the University as you have been; but
I have driven the plough many a time before my father, I thank God; yet,
notwithstanding, in the defence of God's truth, and in the cause of my
Master, Christ, by his grace I will set my foot against the foot of any
of you all, in the maintenance and defence of the same; and if I had a
thousand lives they should go for payment thereof." So the Chancellor
condemned her, and she returned to the prison joyful. - Charles
Bradbury.

[Psa 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001.md)

"The Lord is my light," etc. St. John tells us, that "in Christ was
life; and the life was the light of men;" but he adds that "the light
shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not." [Joh
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004.md), [Joh
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005.md). There is a great difference
between the light, and the eye that sees it. A blind man may know a
great deal about the shining of the sun, but it does not shine for him -
it gives him no light. So, to know that "God is light," is one thing
([Jo1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005).md), and to be able to say,
"The Lord is my light," is quite another thing. The Lord must be the
light by which the way of life is made plain to us - the light by which
we may see to walk in that way - the light that exposes the darkness of
sin - the light by which we can discover the hidden sins of our own
hearts. When he is thus our light, then he is our salvation also. He is
pledged to guide us right; not only to show us sin, but to save us from
it. Not only to make us see God's hatred of sin, and his curse upon it,
but also to draw us unto God's love, and to take away the curse. With
the Lord lighting us along the road of salvation, who, or what need we
fear? Our life is hid with Christ in God. [Col
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#003.md). We are weak, very weak, but his
"strength is made perfect in weakness." [Co2
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009.md). With the Lord himself pledged to
be the strength of our life, of whom need we be afraid? - From
Sacramental Meditations on the Twenty-seventh Psalm, 1843.

[Psa 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001.md)

"The Lord is my light." "Light" which makes all things visible, was the
first made of all visible things; and whether God did it for our
example, or no, I know not; but ever since, in imitation of this manner
of God's proceeding, the first thing we do when we intend to do
anything, is to get us "light." - Sir Richard Baker.

[Psa 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001.md)

"The Lord is my light." Adorable Sun, cried St. Bernard, I cannot walk
without thee: enlighten my steps, and furnish this barren and ignorant
mind with thoughts worthy of thee. Adorable fulness of light and heat,
be thou the true noonday of my soul; exterminate its darkness, disperse
its clouds; burn, dry up, and consume all its filth and impurities.
Divine Sun, rise upon my mind, and never set. - Jean Baptiste Elias
Avrillon, 1652-1729.

[Psa 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001.md)

"Whom shall I fear?" Neither spiritual nor military heroes do exploits
through cowardice. Courage is a necessary virtue. In Jehovah is the best
possible foundation for unflinching intrepidity. - William S. Plumer.

[Psa 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001.md)

"Of whom shall I be afraid?" I have no notion of a timid, disingenuous
profession of Christ. Such preachers and professors are like a rat
playing at hide-and-seek behind a wainscot, who puts his head through a
hole to see if the coast is clear, and ventures out if nobody is in the
way; but slinks back again if danger appears. We cannot be honest to
Christ except we are bold for him. He is either worth all we can lose
for him, or he is worth nothing. - H. G. Salter, A. M., in "The Book of
Illustrations," 1840.

[Psa 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#002.md)

"When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up
my flesh, they stumbled and fell." There is no such dainty dish to a
malicious stomach, as the flesh of an enemy; it goes down without
chewing, and they swallow it up whole like cormorants. But though malice
have a ravenous stomach, yet she hath but slow digestion; though her
teeth be sharp, yet her feet are lame, at least apt to stumble; and this
made well for David, for when his enemies came upon him to eat up his
flesh, because they came upon the feet of malice, "they stumbled and
fell." A man may stumble and yet not fall; but to stumble and fall
withal, is the proper stumbling of "the wicked," and especially of the
maliciously wicked; and such, it seems, was the stumbling of David's
enemies, because the enemies were such; and such I doubt not shall be
the stumbling of mine enemies, because mine are such; and of what then,
of whom now, should I be afraid? - Sir Richard Baker.

[Psa 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#002.md)

"When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up
my flesh, they stumbled and fell." He describes his enemies by their
malice, and by their ruin. 1. His enemies were cruel enemies,
blood-suckers, eaters of flesh. We call them cannibals. As indeed men
that have not grace, if they have greatness, and be opposed, their
greatness is inaccessible, one man is a devil to another. The Scripture
calls them "wolves, that leave nothing till morning." [Zep
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#003.md). As the great fishes eat up the
little ones, so great men they make no more conscience of eating up
other men, than of eating bread; they make no more bones of overthrowing
men and undoing them, than of eating bread. "They eat up my people as
they eat bread." [Psa 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#004.md). 2. But
notwithstanding their cruelty, they were overthrown. Saith David, "When
my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell." For,
indeed, God's children, when they are delivered, it is usually with the
confusion of their enemies. God doth two things at once, because the
special grievance of God's children it is from inward and outward
enemies. He seldom or never delivers them but with the confusion of
their enemies. This will be most apparent at the day of judgment, when
Satan, and all that are led by his spirit, all the malignant church,
shall be sent to their own place, and the church shall be for ever free
from all kind of enemies. When the church is most free, then the enemies
of the church are nearest to destruction; like a pair of balances, when
they are up at the one end, they are down at the other. So when it is up
with the church, down go the enemies. - Richard Sibbes.

[Psa 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#002.md)

"The wicked, mine enemies." The wicked hate the godly; there is enmity
between the seed of the woman and the serpent. [Gen
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015.md). As in nature there is an
antipathy between the vine and the bay-tree, the elephant and the
dragon. Vultures have an antipathy against sweet smells: so in the
wicked there is an antipathy against the people of God; they hate the
sweet perfumes of their graces. It is true the saints have their
infirmities; but the wicked do not hate them for these, but for their
holiness; and from this hatred artseth open violence: the thief hates
the light, therefore would blow it out. - Thomas Watson.

[Psa 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#002.md)

There was great wisdom in the prayer of John Wesley: "Lord, if I must
contend, let it not be with thy people." When we have for foes and
enemies those who hate good men, we have at least this consolation, that
God is not on their side, and therefore it is essentially weak. -
William S. Plumer.

[Psa 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#003.md)

"Though an host should encamp against me," etc. He puts the case of the
greatest danger that can be. Though an host should encompass me, "my
heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this I will
be confident." Here is great courage for the time to come. Experience
breeds hope and confidence. David was not so courageous a man of
himself; but upon experience of God's former comfort and assistance, his
faith brake as fire out of the smoke, or as the sun out of a cloud.
Though I was in such-and-such perplexities, yet for the time to come, I
have such confidence and experience of God's goodness, that I will not
fear. He that seeth God by a spirit of faith in his greatness and power,
he sees all other things below as nothing. Therefore, he saith here, he
cares not for the time to come for any opposition; no, not of an army.
"If God be with us, who can be against us?" [Rom
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#031.md). He saw God in his power; and
then, looking from God to the creature, alas! who was he? As Micah, when
he had seen God sitting upon his throne; what was Ahab to him, when he
had seen God once? So when the prophet David had seen God once, then
"though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear," etc.
- Richard Sibbes.

[Psa 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#003.md)

"Though an host should encamp against me," etc. If I love my God, and I
love him with a noble-spirited love, all my enemies will fight against
me in vain; I shall never fear them, and the whole world cannot harm me.
Charity cannot be offended, because she takes offence at nothing.
Enemies, enviers, slanderers, persecutors, I defy you; if I love, I
shall triumph over your attacks. Ye can take away my goods; but if my
love has a generous spirit, I shall be always rich enough, and ye cannot
take away my love, which alone makes all my riches and treasures. Ye may
blacken my reputation; but as I hold you cheaply quit of all homage of
praise and applause, I, with all my heart, give you a free leave to
blame and to defame. Happily for me, ye cannot blacken me before my God,
and his esteem alone makes amends to me, and rewards me, for all your
contempt. Ye can persecute my body, but there I even will help you on by
my penances; the sooner it shall perish, the sooner shall I be delivered
from this domestic enemy, which is a burden to me. What harm, then, can
ye do me? If I am resolved to suffer all and if I think I deserve all
the outrages ye can do me, ye will only give more loftiness of spirit to
my love, more brilliancy to my crown. - Jean Baptiste Elias Avrillon.

[Psa 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#003.md)

Those who are willing to be combatants for God, shall also be more than
conquerors through God. None are so truly courageous as those who are
truly religious. If a Christian live, he knows by whose might he stands;
and if he die, he knows for whose sake he falls. Where there is no
confidence in God, there will be no continuance with God. When the wind
of faith ceases to fill the sails, the ship of obedience ceases to
plough the seas. The taunts of Ishmael shall never make an Isaac
disesteem his inheritance. - William Secker.

[Psa 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#003.md), [Psa
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004.md)

The favourite grows great by the many favours, gifts, jewels, offices,
the prince bestows on him. The Christian grows rich in experiences,
which he wears as bracelets, and keeps as his richest jewels. He calls
one Ebenezer - "hitherto God hath helped;" another Naphtali - "I have
wrestled with God and prevailed;" another Gershom - "I was a stranger;"
another Joseph - "God will yet add more;" and another, Peniel - "I have
seen the face of God." [Sa1 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#012.md); [Gen
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#008.md); [Exo
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#022.md); [Gen
30:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#024.md), and [Gen
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#030.md). I have been delivered from the
lion, therefore shall be from the bear; from lion and bear, therefore
from the Philistines; from the Philistine, therefore from Saul; from
Saul, therefore God will deliver me from every evil work, and preserve
me blameless to his heavenly kingdom. - John Sheffield.

[Psa 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004.md)

"One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I
may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold
the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his temple." Some interpreters
vary concerning what the Psalmist aims at; I understand thus much in a
generality, which is clear, that he means a communion and fellowship
with God, which is that one thing, which if a Christian had, he needs
desire no more: that we should all desire and desire again and be in
love with, and that is enough even to satisfy us, the fruition of God,
and the beholding of him in his ordinances, in his temple, to have
correspondency and fellowship and communion with him there. O God,
vouchsafe us that! Now this is so infinitely sweet, that it was the
Psalmist's only desire, and the sum of all his desires here, and
therefore much more in the tabernacle of heaven which doth make up the
consummation and completeness of all our happiness. - John Stoughton.

[Psa 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004.md)

"One thing have I desired of the Lord," etc: Seeing David would make but
one request to God, why would he not make a greater? for, alas I what a
poor request is this - to desire to dwell in God's house? and what to
do? but only to see? and to see what? but only a beauty, a lading thing,
at most but to enquire; and what is enquiring? but only to hear news; a
vain fancy. And what cause in any of these why David should make it his
request to God? But mark, O my soul, what goes with it! Take altogether
- "to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his temple." And
now tell me, if there be, if there can be, any greater request to be
made? any greater cause to be earnest about it? For though worldly
beauty be a fading thing, yet "the beauty of the Lord," shall continue
when the world shall fade away; and though enquiring after news be a
vain fancy, yet to enquire in God's Temple is the way to learn there is
no new thing under the sun, and there it was that Solomon learned that
"all is vanity." Indeed, this "one thing," that David desires, is in
effect that unum necessarium that Christ speaks of in the gospel; which
Mary makes choice of there, as David doth here. - Sir Richard Baker.

[Psa 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004.md)

"One thing," etc. A heavenly mind gathers itself up into one wish and no
more. "One thing have I desired of the Lord, which I will require."
Grant me thyself, O Lord, and I will ask no more. The new creature asks
nothing of God, but to enjoy God: give me this, O Lord, and for the
rest, let Ziba take all. I will part with all to buy that one pearl, the
riches of heavenly grace. - Jeremy Taylor.

[Psa 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004.md)

"One thing." The first thing, then, is David's choice, summarily
described in the word, "one thing." So Christ confirmeth the prophet's
word while he called Mary's choice, "one thing." [Luk
10:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#042.md). And that for these three
reasons: First, because it is not a common but a chief good. If there be
any good above it, it is not the chief good; and if there be any good
equal unto it, it is not alone. Next, because it is the last end which
we mind eternally to enjoy; if there be any end beyond it, it is not the
last, but amids, and a degree to it. All mids and ends are used for it,
but it is sought for itself, and, therefore, must be but one. Thirdly,
it is a centre whereunto all reasonable spirits draw. As all lines from
a circle meet in the centre, so every one that seeketh happiness aright
meeteth in the chief good, as the only thing which they intend, and,
therefore, must be one. - William Struther, in "True Happiness, or King
David's Choice," 1633.

[Psa 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004.md)

"One thing." Changes, great changes, and many bereavements there have
been in my life. I have been emptied from vessel to vessel. But one
thing has never failed - one thing makes me feel that my life has been
one; it has calmed my joys, it has soothed my sorrows, it has guided me
in difficulty, it has strengthened me in weakness. It is the presence of
God - a faithful and loving God. Yes, brethren, the presence of God is
not only light, it is unity. It gives unity to the heart that believes
it - unity to the life that is conformed to it. It was the presence of
God in David's soul that enabled him to say, "One thing have I desired
of the Lord;" and in St. Paul's that enabled him to say, "This one thing
I do." - George Wagner, in the "Wanderings of the Children of Israel,"
1862.

[Psa 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004.md)

"One thing." -

One master passion in the breast.

Like Aaron s serpent, swallows up the rest.

Alexander Pope.

[Psa 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004.md)

"That I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life." To
approach continually unto the temple, and thither continually to repair
was the dwelling, no doubt, here meant; to dwell, to reside continually
there, not to come for a spurt or a fit.... And thus dwelt Hannah, the
daughter of Phanuel, who is said, in the second of Luke, for the space
of four score and four years not to have gone out of the temple. Not
that she was there always, but often, saith Lyra; and venerable Bede to
the same purpose. Not that she was never absent, no, not an hour; but
for that she was often in the temple. And the same St. Luke, speaking of
our Saviour's disciples, after they had seen him ascended into heaven -
"They returned," saith he, "to Jerusalem with great joy: and were
continually in the temple, praising and blessing God," [Luk
24:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#052.md), [Luk
24:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#053.md). Thus, St. Austin's mother, in
her time too, might be said to dwell in God's house, whereunto she came
so duly and truly twice a day, "That she, in thy Scriptures," saith St.
Austin, "might hear, O God, what thou saidst to her, and thou, in her
prayers, what she said to thee." In a word, such were the Christians the
same St. Austin speaks of in another place, whom he calleth the emmets
of God. "Behold the emmet of God," saith he, "it riseth early every day,
it runneth to God's church, it there prayeth, it heareth the lesson
read, it singeth a Psalm, it ruminateth what it heareth, it meditateth
thereupon, and hoardeth up within itself the precious corn gathered from
that barn-floor." - John Day's "David's Desire to go to Church," 1609.

[Psa 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004.md)

"That I mall dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life." In
the beginning of the Psalm, David keeps an audit of his soul's accounts,
reckoning up the large incomes and lasting treasures of God's bounty,
grace, and mercy; the sum whereof is this: The Lord is my light and my
life, my strength and my salvation. And now, where shall David design
his presence, but where is his light? Where shall he desire his person,
but where is his strength? Where shall he wish his soul, but where is
his life? and where shall he fix his habitation, but where is his
salvation? even in communion with his God; and this, especially, in the
holy worship of his sanctuary. No wonder, then, if above all things he
desires and seeks after this "one thing," "to dwell in the house of the
Lord," etc. - Robert Mossom.

[Psa 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004.md)

"The house of the Lord." It \[the tabernacle, the sanctuary\] is called
the house of God because he is present there, as a man delights to be
present in his house. It is the place where God will be met withal. As a
man will be found in his house, and there he will have suitors come to
him, where he reveals his secrets. A man rests, he lies, and lodgeth in
his house. Where is a man so familiar as in his house? and what other
place hath he such care to protect and provide for as his house? and he
lays up his treasures and his jewels in his house. So God lays up all
the treasures of grace and comfort in the visible church. In the church
he is to be spoken with as a man in his house. There he gives us sweet
meetings; there are mutual, spiritual kisses. "Let him kiss me with the
kisses of his mouth." [Sol 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#002.md). A
man's house is his castle, as we say, that he will protect and provide
for. God will be sure to protect and provide for his church. Therefore
he calls the church of God, that is, the tabernacle (that was the church
at that time), the house of God. If we apply it to our times, that that
answers the tabernacle now, is particular visible churches under
particular pastors, where the means of salvation are set up. Particular
visible churches now are God's tabernacle. The church of the Jews was a
national church. There was but one church, but one place, and one
tabernacle; but now God hath erected particular tabernacles. Every
particular church and congregation under one pastor, their meeting is
the church of God, a several church independent. - Richard Sibbes.

"To behold the beauty of the Lord." That was one end of his desire, to
dwell in the house of God; not to feed his eyes with speculations and
goodly sights (as indeed there were in the tabernacle goodly things to
be seen). No; he had a more spiritual sight than that. He saw the inward
spiritual beauty of those spiritual things. The other were but outward
things, as the apostle calls them. I desire to dwell in the house of the
Lord, "to behold the beauty of the Lord," the inward beauty of the Lord
especially. - Richard Sibbes.

[Psa 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004.md)

"The beauty of the Lord." In connection with these words, we would try
to show that the character of God is attractive, and fitted to inspire
us with love for him, and to make us, as it were, run after him. The
discussion of our subject may be arranged under three heads. I. Some of
the elements of the beauty of the Lord. II. Where the beauty of the Lord
may be seen. III. Peculiar traits of the beauty of the Lord. I. Some of
the elements of the beauty of the Lord. God is a Spirit. Hence his
beauty is spiritual, and its elements must be sought for in spiritual
perfection. 1. One of the elements of this beauty is holiness. 2. But
the elements of the divine beauty on which we intend at this time to
dwell, are those which are included under the general description of
God's mercy and grace. The attractiveness of these is more easily
perceived, and their influence is sooner felt by persons in our fallen
condition. It is mainly through the instrumentality of these that
sinners are won over from their enmity against God, and that the Holy
Ghost sheds abroad the love of God in our hearts. 3. Another thing,
which we may call an element of beauty in God, is the combination of his
various attributes in one harmonious whole. The colours of the rainbow
are beautiful, when taken one by one: but there is a beauty in the
rainbow, which arises not from any single tint; there is a beauty in it
which would not exist if the several hues were assumed in succession - a
beauty which is the result of their assemblage and collocation, and
consists in their blended radiance. In like manner do the several
perfections, which co-exist and unite in the nature of God, produce a
glorious beauty. Holiness is beautiful; mercy is beautiful; truth is
beautiful. But, over and above, there is a beauty which belongs to such
combinations and harmonies as the Psalmist describes, when he tells us,
"Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed
each other." "Thy mercy, O Lord, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness
reacheth unto the clouds. Thy righteousness is like the great mountains;
thy judgments are a great deep," etc. II. We are next to enquire where
the beauty of the Lord may be seen. It may so far be seen in the natural
world. The throne of nature, although in some respects clouds and
darkness are round about it, is not without its rainbow of beauty, any
more than the throne of grace. The beauty of the Lord may be seen in the
moral law. In the law! Even so. In the unbending law, with its terrible
anathema, his beauty and amiableness shine forth. The law is full of
love. The duties of the law are duties of love. Love is the fulfilling
of the law. The curse of the law is designed and employed for the
maintenance of love. Obedience to the law, and the reign of love, are
but different aspects of the same state of things. And one of the
sublimest lessons of the law is the fact, that God is love. Again, the
beauty of the Lord may be seen in the gospel. We see it, as it were, by
reflection, in the law; in the gospel, we see it directly. The law shows
us the hearts of men, as God would have them to be; the gospel shows us
God's own heart. Again, the beauty of the Lord is seen in Christ. It is
seen in Christ, for he is the brightness of the Father's glory, and the
express image of his person; and he that hath seen Christ, hath seen the
Father. The beauty of the Lord is seen in Christ, when we consider him
as the Father's gift, and when we look to his offices and to his
character. The character of Christ was the finest spectacle of moral
beauty which men or angels ever set their eyes on. III. We conclude by
noticing some traits of the beauty of the Lord. 1. It never deceives. 2.
It never fades. 3. It never loses its power. 4. It never disappoints. -
Condensed from Andrew Gray (1805-1861), in "Gospel Contrasts and
Parallels."

"The beauty of the Lord." The Lord's beauty, to be seen in his house, is
not the beauty of his essence, for so no man can see God and live ([Exo
33:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#018.md), [Exo
33:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#020).md); before this glorious beauty
the angels cover their faces with their wings ([Isa
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001.md), [Isa
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#002).md); but it is the beauty of his
ordinances, wherein God doth reveal to the eyes of men's minds,
enlightened by his Spirit, the pleasant beauty of his goodness, justice,
love, and mercy in Jesus Christ. - Thomas Pierson, M.A., 1570-1633.

[Psa 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004.md)

"The beauty of the Lord." - "Beauty" is too particular a word to express
the fulness of the Holy Ghost, the pleasantness or the delight of God.
Take the word in a general sense, in your apprehensions. It may be the
object of all senses, inward and outward. Delight is most transcendent
for pleasantness; for indeed God in his ordinances, is not only "beauty"
to the eye of the soul, but is ointment to the smell, and sweetness to
the taste, and all in all to all the powers of the soul. God in Christ,
therefore, he is delightful and sweet...."The beauty of the Lord" is
especially the amiable things of God, which is his mercy and love, that
makes all other things beautiful that is in the church. - Richard
Sibbes.

[Psa 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004.md)

"To enquire in his temple." The more grace the more business ye will
find ye have to do with God in his ordinances; little grace hath little
to do, and much grace hath much to do; he hath always business with God,
special earnest business. "To behold the beauty of the Lord, and to
enquire in his temple." Oh, I have somewhat to enquire after; I am to do
something by this duty, and therefore cannot trifle. He that comes to
visit his friend in a compliment, he talks, he walks, he trifles, and
goes home again; but he that comes upon business, he is full of it: he
is like Abraham's honest and faithful servant. [Gen
24:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#033.md). "And there was set meat before
him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told my errand." I
have great business with the Lord, about the church, and about my soul,
and I will not eat, nor talk, nor think, nor dally about anything, till
I have told mine errand, or heard my Maker's errand unto me. And for
this end it's a rare thing to carry somewhat always on the spirit, to
spread before God, a heart pregnant with some needful request or matter
whereof to treat with God. [Psa 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#001.md).

It was David's earnest prayer, "One thing have I desired of the Lord,
that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all
the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in
his temple." There are many that pray David's words, but not with
David's heart. Unum petii, one thing have I desired, de praeterito, for
the time past; et hoc requiram, this I will still seek after, de futuro,
for the time to come: I have required it long, and this suit I will urge
till I have obtained it. What? To dwell in some of the houses of God all
the days of my life, and to leave them to my children after me; not to
serve him there with devotion, but to make the place mine own
possession? These love the house of God too well; they love it to have
and to hold: but because the conveyance is made by the lawyer, and not
by the minister, their title will be found nought in the end; and if
there be not a nisi prius to prevent them, yet at that great day of
universal audit, the Judge of all the world shall condemn them. By this
way, the nearer to the church, the further from God. The Lord's temple
is ordained to gain us to him, not for us to gain it from him. If we
love the Lord, we "will love the habitation of his house, and the place
where his honour dwelleth;" that so by being humble frequenters of his
temple below, we may be made noble saints of his house above, the
glorious kingdom of Jesus Christ. - Thomas Adams.

[Psa 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004.md)

David being in this safe condition, what doth he now think upon or look
at, as his main scope? Not as Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, to sit still and
be merry, when he had overcome the Romans and all his enemies, as he
sometime said to Cyneas, the philosopher, but to improve his rest to
perpetual piety, in going from day to day to God's house, as Hannah is
said afterwards to have done. Luke 2. And this, first, for the solace of
his soul, in seeing the beauty of his sanctuary. Secondly, that he might
still be directed aright and be safe. Thirdly, that he might yet be more
highly exalted in kingly glory. Fourthly, for all this, as he should
have abundant cause, sacrificing and singing Psalms to God without
ceasing: see [Psa 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#005.md), [Psa
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#006.md). - John Mayer.

[Psa 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004.md)

O my soul, what sights have I seen in the house of God! what provisions
have I tasted! what entertainments have I had! what enlargements in
prayer and answers thereto! what impressions under his word, what
entertainment at his table, as he has sometimes brought me into his
banqueting-house, and his banner over me has been love! And though I
cannot, it may be, say so much of this as some others; yet what I have
found, I cannot but remember with thankfulness, and desire more; and as
this was in the house of God, here would I still desire to dwell. -
Daniel Wilcox, 1676-1733.

[Psa 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#005.md)

"The time of trouble." Though God does not always deliver his people out
of trouble, yet he delivers them from the evil of trouble, the despair
of trouble, by supporting the spirit; nay, he delivers by trouble, for
he sanctifies the trouble to cure the souls, and by less troubles
delivers from greater. - From a Broad Sheet in the British Museum,
dated, "London: printed for D. M., 1678."

[Psa 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#005.md)

"He shall hide me." The word here used means to hide, to secrete, and
then, to defend or protect. It would properly be applied to one who had
fled from oppression, or from any impending evil, and who should be
secreted in a house or cavern, and thus rendered safe from pursuers, or
from the threatening evil. - Albert Barnes.

[Psa 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#005.md)

"Pavilion" comes from papilio, a butterfly. It signifies a tent made of
cloth stretched out on poles, which in form resembles in some measure
the insect above named. - Adam Clarke.

[Psa 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#005.md)

"In the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me." He alludes to the
ancient custom of offenders, who used to flee to the tabernacle or
altar, where they esteemed themselves safe. [Kg1

[Psa 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#005.md)

"In the secret of his tabernacle." Were there no other place, he would
put me in the holy of holies, so that an enemy would not dare to
approach me. - Adam Clarke.

[Psa 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#006.md)

"Now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me." A
man cannot drown so long as his head is above water. Now, it is the
proper office of hope to do this for the Christian in times of any
danger. [Luk 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#028.md). "When these things
begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads: for your
redemption draweth nigh." A strange time, one would think, for Christ
then to bid his disciples lift up their heads in, when they see other
men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things
which are coming on the earth ([Luk
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#026).md); yet now is the time of the
rising of their sun, when others' is setting, and the blackness of
darkness is overtaking others; because now the Christian's feast is
coming, for which hope hath saved its stomach so long. "Your redemption
draweth nigh." Two things make the head hang down - fear and shame; hope
easeth the Christian's heart of both these, and so forbids him to give
any sign of a desponding mind by a dejected countenance. - William
Gurnall.

[Psa 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#006.md)

"Therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy." "Surely."
some may say, "he could have called on God beyond the precincts of the
temple. Wherever he wandered as an exile, he carried with him the
precious promise of God, so that he needed not to put so great a value
upon the sight of the external edifice. He appears, by some gross
imagination or other, to suppose that God could be enclosed by wood and
stones." But if we examine the words more carefully, it will be easy to
see, that his object was altogether different from a mere sight of the
noble building and its ornaments, however costly. He speaks, indeed, of
the temple, but he places that beauty not so much in the goodliness that
was to be seen by the eye, as in its being the celestial pattern which
was shown to Moses, as it is written in [Exo
25:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#040.md) : "And look that thou make them
after their pattern, which was showed thee in the mount." As the fashion
of the temple was not framed according to the wisdom of man, but was an
image of spiritual things, the prophet directed his eyes and all his
affections to this object. Their madness is, therefore, truly detestable
who wrest this place in favour of pictures and images, which, instead of
deserving to be numbered among temple ornaments, are rather like dung
and filth, defiling all the purity of holy things. - John Calvin.

[Psa 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#008.md)

"When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face,
Lord, will I seek." In the former verse, David begins a prayer to God,
"Hear, O Lord; have mercy upon me, and answer me." This verse is a
ground of that prayer, "Seek ye my face," saith God. The heart answers
again, "Thy face, Lord, will 1 seek;" therefore I am encouraged to pray
to thee. In the words are contained God's command and David's obedience.
God's warrant and David's work answerable, the voice and the echo: the
voice, "Seek my face;" the rebound back again of a gracious heart, "Thy
face, Lord, will I seek." "When thou saidst." It is not in the original.
It only makes way to the sense. Passionate speeches are usually abrupt:
"Seek my face:" "Thy face, Lord, will I seek." ... God is willing to be
known. He is willing to open and discover himself; God delights not to
hide himself. God stands not upon state, as some emperors do that think
their presence diminisheth respect. God is no such God, but he may be
searched into. Man, if any weakness be discovered, we can soon search
into the depth of his excellency; but with God it is clean otherwise.
The more we know of him, the more we shall admire him. None admire him
more than the blessed angels, that see most of him, and the blessed
spirits that have communion with him. Therefore he hides not himself,
nay, he desires to be known; and all those that have his Spirit desire
to make him known. Those that suppress the knowledge of God in his will,
what he performs for men, and what he requires of them, they are enemies
to God and of God's people. They suppress the opening of God, clean
contrary to God's meaning; "Seek my face;" I desire to be made known,
and lay open myself to you. Therefore we may observe by the way, that
when we are in any dark condition, that a Christian finds not the beams
of God shining on him, let him not lay the blame upon God, as if God
were a God that delighted to hide himself. Oh, no! it is not his
delight. He loves not strangeness to his poor creatures. It is not a
point of his policy. He is too great to affect such poor things. No; the
fault is altogether in us. We walk not worthy of such a presence; we
want humility and preparation. If there be any darkness in the creature,
that he finds God doth not so shine on him as in former times,
undoubtedly the cause is in himself; for God saith, "Seek my face." He
desires to reveal himself. - Richard Sibbes.

[Psa 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#008.md)

"When thou saidst, Seek ye my face," etc. All the Spirit's motions are
seasonable, and therefore not to be put off; for delay is a kind of
denial, and savours of such ungrateful contempt, as must needs be very
displeasing to him. "When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said
unto thee, Thy face, Lord, will I seek." God does not only expect such
an answer, but expects it immediately upon his call. Whenever he blows
with his wind, he looks that we should spread our sails. If we refuse
his offered help, we may deservedly want it when desired. As Christ
withdrew himself from the spouse because she let him stand knocking so
long at the door of her heart, and she still deferred to open, and tired
out his loving forbearance with vain and frivolous excuses. Sol. Song,
5:2, etc. But as we must not omit the present performance of any duty
which he excites unto, we must not check his influences by being weary
of the duties which he assists us in: if we do not improve extraordinary
aids by holding out the longer, we provoke him to depart. - Timothy
Cruso.

[Psa 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#008.md)

"When thou saidst, Seek ye my face," etc. We see here thus much, that
God must begin with us, before we can close with him; God must seek us,
before we can seek him; God must first desire that we should draw near
to him, before we for our particulars are able to draw near unto God.
Thou saidst, Seek my face; and then, and not till then my heart said,
Thy face, Lord, will I seek. - Thomas Horton.

[Psa 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#008.md)

"When thou saidst," etc. Now God then speaks to the heart to pray when
not only he puts upon the duty by saying to the conscience, This thou
oughtest to do; but God's speaking to pray is such as his speech at
first was, when he made the world, when he said, "Let there be light,
and there was light:" so he says, let there be a prayer, and there is a
prayer; that is, he pours upon a man a spirit of grace and supplication,
a praying disposition; he puts in motives, suggests arguments and pleas
to God; all which you shall find come in readily, and of themselves, and
that likewise with a quickening heat and enlargement of affection, and
with a lingering, and longing, and restlessness of spirit to be alone,
to pour out the soul to God, and to vent and form those motions and
suggestions into a prayer, till you have laid them together, and made a
prayer of them. And this is a speaking to the heart. Observe such times
when God doth thus, and neglect them not, then to strike whilst the iron
is hot; thou hast then his ear; it is a special opportunity for that
business, such a one as thou mayst never have the like. Suitors at court
observe molissima fandi tempora, their times of begging when they have
kings in a good mood, which they will be sure to take the advantage of;
but especially if they should find that the king himself should begin of
himself to speak of the business which they would have of him: and thus
that phrase of [Psa 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#017.md), that God
prepares the heart, is understood by some, that God prepares the heart,
and causeth the ear to hear; that is, he fashions it and composeth it
into a praying frame. And sure it is a great sign that God means to hear
us when himself shall thus indite the petition. - Thomas Goodwin.

[Psa 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#008.md)

"When thou saidst," etc. And well may this be pleaded, in that God useth
not so to stir up and strengthen us to seek him, but when he intendeth
to be found of us. [Psa 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#017.md). "Thou
hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou
wilt cause thine ear to hear." [Jer
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#013.md). "And ye shall seek me, and find
me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart." And God maketh it
an argument to himself, that if he say to any inwardly as well as
outwardly, "Seek my face," he that speaketh righteousness cannot speak
thus to them, and frustrate their prayers, and so bid them seek his face
in vain. [Isa 45:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#019.md), "I said not unto
the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain; I the Lord speak right things."
If Ahasuerus bid his spouse to ask, surely he will not fail to grant her
petition ([Est 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#002).md); so here. And as
when Christ called the blind man to come to him to tell him his
grievance, it was truly said to him by them, "Be of good comfort, rise,
for he calleth thee." [Mar 10:49](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#049.md). So
it is in this case. - Thomas Cobbell.

[Psa 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#008.md)

"My heart said unto thee." The heart is between God and our obedience,
as it were, an ambassador. It understands from God what God would have
done, and then it lays a command upon the whole man. The heart and
conscience of man is partly divine, partly human. It hath some divinity
in it, especially if the man be a holy man. God speaks, and the heart
speaks. God speaks to the heart, and the heart speaks to us. And
ofttimes when we hear conscience speaking to us, we neglect it; and as
St. Augustine said of himself, "God spake often to me, and I was
ignorant of it." When there is no command in the word that the heart
directly thinks of (as indeed many profane careless men scarce have a
Bible in their houses), God speaks to them thus; conscience speaks to
them some broken command, that they learn against their wills. They heed
it not, but David did not so. God said, "Seek ye my face;" his heart
answers, "Thy face, Lord, will I seek." The heart looks upward to God,
and then to itself, "My heart said." It said to thee, and then to
itself. First, his heart said to God, "Lord, I have encouragement from
thee. Thou hast commanded that I should seek thy face." So his heart
looked to God, and then it speaks to itself, "Thy face, Lord, will I
seek." It looks first to God, and then to all things that come from
itself. - Richard Sibbes.

[Psa 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#008.md)

There are divers things considerable of us in this answer and compliance
of David's with God's command or invitation to him. First, it was
seasonable, and in due time; presently does David make this return: "Thy
face, Lord, will I seek." This is the property and disposition of every
wise and prudent Christian, to close with the very first opportunities
of God's invitation. Secondly, this answer, as it was seasonable and
present, so it was also full and complete; the performance was
proportionable to the injunction. Ye shall have some kind of people in
the world that God bids them do one thing and they will be sure to do
the quite contrary; or, at least, not do as much as they should do, but
do it by halves. But, now, here David makes return to God in the full
extent and proportion of obedience. God said, "Seek my face," and he
answered, "Thy face, Lord, will I seek." Thirdly, it was real and
entire, and sincere; "My heart said." It is one thing to say it with the
mouth, and it is another thing to say it with the heart. With the mouth
it is both easy and ordinary, and nothing more usual. Lord, thy face
will we seek, especially in any trouble or calamity, which is incident
unto us; but for the heart to say it, that is not so frequent. Fourthly,
it was settled, and peremptory, "Thy face will I seek;" there is nothing
shall hinder me of it, or keep me from it, but I will do it against all
opposition. Lastly, this protestation of David was absolute and
indefinite and unlimited; "I will seek thy face;" without prescription
of time, or place, or condition; not only now, but hereafter; not only
for a time, but for ever, in all seasons, in all estates, in all
circumstances, still I shall keep me to this - to hold my communion with
thee. Then are we Christians, indeed, when we are so immutably and
irreversibly and independently upon the opinions or practices of any
other person. - Condensed from Thomas Horton.

[Psa 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#008.md)

God hath promised his favour, and, therefore, his people may seek his
favour. Nay, he hath commanded his people to seek his favour, and
therefore they should seek it. It is an unadvised folly, during the
suspension of God's favour, to unson ourselves, and unpeople ourselves,
i.e., by denying the grace and spiritual relation which exist between us
and God. That is not the way to gain favour; for when we have undone our
relation of children we exclude ourselves from the expectation of
favour. No, the wisest and surest way is to seek the renewing of God's
loving countenance, and not to be driven away from God by our unbelief.
- Obadiah Sedgwick, in "The Doubting Believer," 1653.

[Psa 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#009.md)

"Hide not thy face far from me." When I seek thy face, vouchsafe, O God,
not to hide thy face from me; for to what purpose should I seek it if I
cannot find it? and what hope of finding it if thou be bent to hide it?
- Sir Richard Baker.

[Psa 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#009.md)

"Put not thy servant away in anger." God puts away many in anger for
their supposed goodness, but not any at all for their confessed badness.
- John Trapp.

[Psa 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#009.md)

"Thy servant." It is a blessed and happy thing to be God's true
"servant." Consider what the Queen of Sheba said of Solomon's servants
([Kg1 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#008).md): "Happy are these thy
servants," etc. Now Christ Jesus is greater than Solomon ([Mat
12:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#042).md), and so a better Master. Good
earthly masters will honour good servants, as [Pro
27:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#018.md), "He that waiteth on his master
shall be honoured;" [Pro 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#002.md), "A wise
servant shall have a portion, or inheritance, among the brethren." But
however some earthly masters may be Nabals and Labans, yet God will not
be so: [Joh 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#026.md) : "Where I am, there
shall also my servant be." "If any man serve me, him will my Father
honour," see [Luk 12:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#037.md). The watchful
servants are blessed; their master will make them to sit down to meat,
and will come forth and serve them, as [Mat
25:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#021.md), [Mat
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#023.md) : "Well done, thou good and
faithful servant' thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make
thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord." -
Thomas Pierson.

[Psa 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#009.md)

"Thou hast been my help; leave me not," etc. One act of mercy engages
God to another. Men argue thus: I have showed you kindness already,
therefore trouble me no more; but because God has shown mercy he is more
ready still to show mercy; his mercy in election makes him justify,
adopt, glorify. - Thomas Watson.

[Psa 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#009.md)

"Leave me not;" rather, "dismiss me not;" "let not go thy hold of me."
This is the proper sense of the Hebrew verb גּטשׁ, to set a thing loose,
to let it go, to abandon it. - Samuel Horsley.

[Psa 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#010.md)

"When my father and my mother forsake me." As there seems to be some
difficulty in supposing the Psalmist's parents to have "deserted" him,
they might perhaps be said to have "forsaken" him (as Muis conjectures),
that is, to have left him behind them, as being dead. - James Merrick,
M.A., 1720-1769.

[Psa 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#010.md)

"When my father and my mother forsake me." It is indeed the nature of
all living creatures, though never so tender of their young ones, yet
when they are grown to a ripeness of age and strength, to turn them off
to shift for themselves; and even a father and a mother, as tender as
they are, have yet somewhat of this common nature in them; for while
their children are young they lead them by the hand, but when they are
grown up they leave them to their own legs, and if they chance to fall
let them rise as they can. But God even then takes his children up, for
he knows of what they are made; he knows their strength must be as well
supported as their weakness be assisted; he knows they must as well be
taken up when they fall, as be held up when they stand. - Sir Richard
Baker.

[Psa 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#010.md)

"Father and Mother." First, who are they? Properly and chiefly our
natural parents, of whom we were begotten and born; to whom (under God)
we owe our being and breeding. Yet here, not they only; but by
synecdoche all other kinsfolks, neighbours, friends, acquaintances, or,
indeed, more generally yet, all worldly comforts, stays, and helps
whatsoever. 2. But, then, why these named the rathest, and the rest to
be included in these? Because we promise to ourselves more help from
them than from any of the other. We have a nearer relation to, and a
greater interest in them than any other; and they of all other are the
unlikeliest to forsake us. The very brute creatures forsake not their
young ones. A hen will not desert her chickens, nor a bear endure to be
robbed of her whelps. 3 but, then, thirdly, why both named - father and
mother too? Partly because it can hardly be imagined that both of them
should forsake their child, though one should hap to be unkind. Partly
because the father's love being commonly with more providence, the
mother's with more tenderness; both together do better express than
alone either would do, the abundant love of God towards us, who is
infinitely dear over us, beyond the care of the most provident father,
beyond the affection of the tenderest mother. 4. But, then, fourthly,
when may they be said to forsake us? When at any time they leave us
destitute of such help as we stand in need of; whether it be out of
choice, when they list not to help us, though they might if they would;
or out of necessity, when they cannot help us, though they would if they
could. - Robert Sanderson.

[Psa 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#010.md)

"Then the Lord will take me up." But dictum factum: these are but words:
Are there producible any deeds to make it good? Verily, there are, and
that to the very letter. When Ishmael's mother, despairing of his life,
had forsaken him, and laid him down gasping (his last, for ought she
knew or could do to help it), in the wilderness, the Lord took him up;
he opened a new spring of water, and opened her eyes to see it, and so
the child was preserved. Genesis 21 When Moses' parents had also
forsaken him (for they durst not stand by him any longer), and laid him
down among the rushy flags, the Lord took him up too. He provided him of
a saviour, the king's own daughter, and of a nurse the child's own
mother - and so he was preserved too. [Exo
2:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#006.md). Take but two examples more, out
of either Testament one. David and St. Paul, both forsaken of men, both
taken up of God. How was David forsaken, in [Psa
142:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#004.md), when he had looked upon his
right hand, and saw no man that would know him; he had no place to fly
unto, and no man cared for his soul. But all the while Dominus ad
dextris, there was one at his right hand (though at first he was not
aware of him), ready to take him up; as it there followeth, [Psa
142:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#005.md), "I cried unto thee, O Lord; I
said, Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living." And
how St. Paul was forsaken; take it from himself, [Ti2
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#016.md), "At my first answer no man stood
with me, but all men forsook me:" a heavy case, and had been heavier had
there not been one ready to take his part, at the next verse,
"Nevertheless the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me," etc. What
need we any more witnesses? In ore duorum - in the mouth of two such
witnesses the point is sufficiently established. But you will yet say,
these two might testify what they had already found post factum. But
David, in the text, pronounceth it de futuro, beforehand, and that
somewhat confidently: "The Lord will take me up." As he doth also
elsewhere: "Sure I am that the Lord will avenge the poor, and maintain
the cause of the helpless." [Psa
140:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#001.md). But is there any ground for
that? Doubtless there is; a double ground; one in the nature, another in
the promise of God. In his nature four qualities there are (we take
leave so to speak, suitably to our own low apprehensions, for in the
Godhead there are properly no qualities); but call them qualities or
attributes, or what else you will; there are four perfections in God,
opposite to those defects which in our earthly parents we have found to
be the chief causes why they do so oft forsake us; which give us full
assurance that he will take us up when all other succours fail us. Those
are his love, his wisdom, his power, his eternity, and all in his
nature. To which four, add his promise, and you have the fulness of all
the assurance that can be desired. - Robert Sanderson.

[Psa 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#010.md)

"The Lord will take me up:" Hebrew, will gather me, that is, take me
into his care and keeping. In the civil law we find provision made for
outcasts and friendless persons; some hospitals to entertain them, some
liberties to comfort and compensate their trouble. 'Tis sure, that in
God the forlorn and fatherless find mercy. - John Trapp.

[Psa 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#011.md)

"Teach me thy way, O Lord." Having compared himself to an exposed,
deserted infant, adopted by God, he anon fairly asks to be shown how to
walk. He asks the grace of being able to observe all his holy
commandments, which he never loses sight of through the whole one
hundred-and-fifty Psalms. What else could he do? when it was the only
path to that heavenly house of God, which he had just declared to be the
only wish and desire of his heart. - Robert Bellarmine (Cardinal),
1542-1621.

[Psa 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#011.md)

"Lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies." If a man, travelling
in the King's highway, be robbed between sun and sun, satisfaction is
recoverable upon the county where the robbery was made; but if he takes
his journey in the night, being an unseasonable time, the it is at his
own peril, he must take what falls. So, if a man keep in God's ways, he
shall be sure of God's protection; but if he stray out of them, he
exposeth himself to danger. - Robert Skinner (Bishop), 1636.

[Psa 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#011.md)

"Because of mine enemies." If once a man commence a professor, the eyes
of all are upon him; and well they may, for his profession in the world
is a separation from the world. Believers condemn those by their lives
who condemn them by their lips. Righteous David saw many who were
waiting to triumph in his mistakes. Hence the more they watched, the
more he prayed: "Teach me thy way, O Lord, and lead me in a plain path,
because of mine enemies." It may be rendered, because of mine observers.
Christian, if you dwell in the open tent of licentiousness, the wicked
will not walk backward, like modest Shem and Japheth, to cover your
shame: but they will walk forward, like cursed Ham, to publish it. Thus
they make use of your weakness as a plea for their wickedness. Men are
merciless in their censures of Christians; they have no sympathy for
their infirmity: while God weighs them in more equal scales, and says,
"The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak." While a saint is a dove
in the eyes of God, he is only a raven in the estimation of sinners. -
William Seeker.

[Psa 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#013.md)

"I had fainted," etc. Study much the all-sufficiency, the power, the
goodness, the unchangeableness of God. 1. The all-sufficiency of God.
What fulness there is in him to make up all you can lose for him; what
refreshments there are in him to sweeten all you can suffer for him.
What fulness! You may as well doubt that all the waters of the ocean
cannot fill a spoon, as that the divine fulness cannot be enough to you,
if you should have nothing left in this world; for all the waters that
cover the sea are not so much as a spoonful, compared with the boundless
and infinite fulness of all-sufficiency. What refreshments in him! One
drop of divine sweetness is enough to make one in the very agony of the
cruellest death to cry out with joy, "The bitterness of death is past."
Now in him there are not only drops, but rivers; nor a scanty
sprinkling, but an infinite fulness. 2. Eye much the power of God, how
it can support under the cross, what it can bring to pass for you by the
cross. No cross so sharp and grievous, but he can make it sweet and
comfortable. No cross so heavy and intolerable, but he can make light
and easy. No cross so ignominious and reproachful, but he can turn it to
your honour. No cross so fastened to you, but he can easily remove it.
3. His goodness. His all-sufficiency and power make him able, his
goodness makes him willing to do for his people under the cross what his
all-sufficiency and almighty power can afford. His goodness sets his
mighty power a-work for his suffering saints. His goodness sets his
all-sufficiency, his fulness, abroach for them, so that it runs freely
upon them; and never more freely than when they are under the cross. "I
had fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord," &c.
What is it that makes you ready to faint under the cross, or thoughts
and foresight of it? Look to the goodness of God, there is support. -
Condensed from David Clarkson.

[Psa 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#013.md)

"I had fainted." The words in italics are supplied by our translators;
but, far from being necessary, they injure the sense. Throw out the
words I had fainted, and leave a break after the verse, and the elegant
figure of the Psalmist will be preserved: "Unless I had believed to see
the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living" - what! what, alas!
should have become of me! - Adam Clarke.

[Psa 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#013.md)

"Unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of
the living." In the Hebrew this verse is elliptical, as Calvin here
translates it. In the French version he supplies the ellipsis, by adding
to the end of the verse the words, "C'estoit fait de moy," "I had
perished." In our English version, the words, "I had fainted," are
introduced as a supplement in the beginning of the verse. Both the
supplement of Calvin, and that of our English version, which are
substantially the same, doubtless explain the meaning of the passage,
but they destroy the elegant abrupt for in of the expression employed by
the Psalmist, who breaks off in the middle of his discourse without
completing the sentence, although what he meant to say is very evident.
- Editorial Note to Calvin, in loc.

[Psa 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#013.md)

Under sore trouble and distress, labour to exercise a strong and lively
faith. It was a noble and heroic resolution in that holy man Job, under
his singular trials ([Job 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#015).md):
"Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him;" as if he had said, Let my
strokes be never so sore and heavy, yet I will not let go my grips of
his word and promises, I will not raze these foundations of my hope. It
was the way the Psalmist kept himself from sinking under his heavy
burdens: "I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of
the Lord in the land of the living." ... Faith brings new strength and
auxiliary supplies of grace from heaven, when the former supply is
exhausted and spent; whereof David had the sweet experience here. As God
doth plant and actuate grace in the soul, so he is pleased to come in
with seasonable supplies and reinforcements to the weak and decayed
graces of his people, answerable to their present exigences and
pressures; and thus he doth from time to time feed the believer's lamp
with fresh oil, give in more faith, more love, more hope, and more
desires; and hereby he gives power to the faint, and strengthens the
things which remain when ready to die. - John Willison.

[Psa 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#013.md)

"Unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of
the living:" a cordial made up of three sovereign ingredients - a hope
to see; and to see the goodness of God; and the goodness of God in the
land of the living. - Sir Richard Baker.

[Psa 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#013.md)

"The land of the living." Alas! what a land of the living is this, in
which there are more dead than living, more under ground than above it;
where the earth is fuller of graves than houses; where life lies
trembling under the hand of death; and where death hath power to
tyrannise over life! No, my soul, there only is the land of the living
where there are none but the living; where there is a church, not
militant, but triumphant; a church indeed, but no church-yard, because
none dead, nor none that can die; where life is not passive, nor death
active; where life sits crowned, and where death is swallowed up in
victory. - Sir Richard Baker.

[Psa 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#014.md)

"Wait on the Lord, be of good courage." Be comfortable, hold fast (as
the Greek hath), be manly, or, quit thee as a man; which word the
apostle useth. [Co1 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#013.md). These are
the words of encouragement against remissness, fear, faintness of heart,
or other infirmities. - Henry Ainsworth.

[Psa 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#014.md)

"Wait on the Lord, be of good courage."

Stand but your ground, your ghostly foes will fly -

Hell trembles at a heaven-directed eye;

Choose rather to defend than to assail -

Self-confidence will in the conflict fail:

When you are challenged you may dangers meet -

True courage is a fixed, not sudden heat;

Is always humble, lives in self-distrust,

And will itself into no danger thrust.

Devote yourself to God, and you will find

God fights the battles of a will resigned.

Love Jesus! love will no base fear endure -

Love Jesus! and of conquest rest secure.

Thomas Ken (Bishop), 1637-1710-11.

[Psa 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#014.md)

Think not the government is out of Christ's hand, when men are doing
many sad things, and giving many heavy blows to the work of God. No, no;
men are but his hand; and it is the hand of God that justly and
righteously is lying heavy upon his people. Look above men, then; you
have not to do with them-there is a turn of matters, just as he is
pleased to turn his hand. - Ralph Erskine, 1685-1752.

[Psalms 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 27:1</span></span>

1 The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the Lord is
the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?

2 When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up
my flesh they stumbled and fell.

3 Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear:
though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident.

[Psa 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001.md)

"The Lord is my light and my salvation." - Here is personal interest,
"my light," "my salvation;" the soul is assured of it, and therefore,
declaring it boldly. "My light" - into the soul at the new birth divine
light is poured as the precursor of salvation; where there is not enough
light to see our own darkness and to long for the Lord Jesus, there is
no evidence of salvation. Salvation finds us in the dark, but it does
not leave us there; it gives light to those who sit in the valley of the
shadow of death. After conversion our God is our joy, comfort, guide,
teacher, and in every sense our light; he is light within, light around,
light reflected from us, and light to be revealed to us. Note, it is not
said merely that the Lord gives light, but that he "is" light; nor that
he gives salvation, but that he is salvation; he, then, who by faith has
laid hold upon God has all covenant blessings in his possession. Every
light is not the sun, but the sun is the father of all lights. This
being made sure as a fact, the argument drawn from it is put in the form
of a question, "Whom shall I fear?" A question which is its own answer.
The powers of darkness are not to be feared, for the Lord, our light,
destroys them; and the damnation of hell is not to be dreaded by us, for
the Lord is our salvation. This is a very different challenge from that
of boastful Goliath, for it is based upon a very different foundation;
it rests not upon the conceited rigour of an arm of flesh, but upon the
real power of the omnipotent I am. "The Lord is the strength of my
life." Here is a third glowing epithet, to show that the writer's hope
was fastened with a threefold cord which could not be broken. We may
well accumulate terms of praise where the Lord lavishes deeds of grace.
Our life derives all its strength from him who is the author of it; and
if he deigns to make us strong we cannot be weakened by all the
machinations of the adversary. "Of whom shall I be afraid?" The bold
question looks into the future as well as the present. "If God be for
us," who can be against us, either now or in time to come?

[Psa 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#002.md)

This verse records a past deliverance, and is an instance of the way in
which experience should be employed to reassure our faith in times of
trial. Each word is instructive. "When the wicked." It is a hopeful sign
for us when the wicked hate us; if our foes were godly men it would be a
sore sorrow, but as for the wicked their hatred is better than their
love. "Even mine enemies and my foes." There were many of them, they
were of different sorts, but they were unanimous in mischief and hearty
in hatred. "Came upon me" - advanced to the attack, leaping upon the
victim like a lion upon its prey. "To eat up my flesh," like cannibals
they would make a full end of the man, tear him limb from limb, and make
a feast for their malice. The enemies of our souls are not deficient in
ferocity, they yield no quarter, and ought to have none in return. See
in what danger David was; in the grip and grasp of numerous, powerful,
and cruel enemies, and yet observe his perfect safety and their utter
discomfiture! "They stumbled and fell." God's breath blew them off their
legs. There were stones in the way which they never reckoned upon, and
over these they made an ignominious tumble. This was literally true in
the case of our Lord in Gethsemane, when those who came to take him went
backward and fell to the ground; and herein he was a prophetic
representative of all wrestling believers who, rising from their knees
shall, by the power of faith, throw their foes upon their faces.

[Psa 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#003.md)

"Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear."
Before the actual conflict, while as yet the battle is untried, the
warrior's heart, being held in suspense, is very liable to become
fluttered. The encamping host often inspires greater dread than the same
host in actual affray. Young tells us of some -

"Who feel a thousand deaths in fearing one."

Doubtless the shadow of anticipated trouble is, to timorous minds, a
more prolific source of sorrow than the trouble itself, but faith puts a
strengthening plaister to the back of courage, and throws out of the
window the dregs of the cup of trembling. "Though war should rise
against me, in this will I be confident." When it actually comes to push
of pike, faith's shield will ward off the blow; and if the first brush
should be but the beginning of a war, yet faith's banners will wave in
spite of the foe. Though battle should succeed battle, and one campaign
should be followed by another, the believer will not be dismayed at the
length of the conflict. Reader, this third verse is the comfortable and
logical inference from the second, confidence is the child of
experience. Have you been delivered out of great perils? then set up
your ensign, wait at your watch-fire, and let the enemy do his worst.

[Psalms 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 27:4</span></span>

4 One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I
may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the
beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his temple.

5 For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the
secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a
rock.

6 And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about
me-therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will
sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the Lord.

[Psa 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004.md)

"One thing." Divided aims tend to distraction, weakness, disappointment.
The man of one book is eminent, the man of one pursuit is successful.
Let all our affection be bound up in one affection, and that affection
set upon heavenly things. "Have I desired" - what we cannot at once
attain, it is well to desire. God judges us very much by the desire of
our hearts. He who rides a lame horse is not blamed by his master for
want of speed, if he makes all the haste he can, and would make more if
he could; God takes the will for the deed with his children. "Of the
Lord." This is the right target for desires, this is the well into which
to dip our buckets, this is the door to knock at, the bank to draw upon;
desire of men, and lie on the dunghill with Lazarus: desire of the Lord,
and be carried of angels into Abraham's bosom. Our desires of the Lord
should be sanctified, humble, constant, submissive, fervent, and it is
well if, as with the Psalmist, they are all molten into one mass. Under
David's painful circumstances we might have expected him to desire
repose, safety, and a thousand other good things, but no, he has set his
heart on the pearl, and leaves the rest. "That will I seek after." Holy
desires must lead to resolute action. The old proverb says, "Wishers and
woulders are never good housekeepers," and "wishing never fills a sack."
Desires are seeds which must be sown in the good soil of activity for
they will yield no harvest. We shall find our desires to be like clouds
without rain, unless followed up by practical endeavours. "That I may
dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life." For the sake of
communion with the King, David longed to dwell always in the palace; so
far from being wearied with the services of the Tabernacle, he longed to
be constantly engaged in them, as his lifelong pleasure. He desired
above all things to be one of the household of God, a home-born child,
living at home with his Father. This is our dearest wish, only we extend
it to those days of our immortal life which have not yet dawned. We pine
for our Father's house above, the home of our souls; if we may but dwell
there for ever, we care but little for the goods or ills of this poor
life. "Jerusalem the golden" is the one and only goal of our heart's
longings. "To behold the beauty of the Lord." An exercise both for
earthly and heavenly worshippers. We must not enter the assemblies of
the saints in order to see and be seen, or merely to hear the minister;
we must repair to the gatherings of the righteous, intent upon the
gracious object of learning more of the loving Father, more of the
glorified Jesus, more of the mysterious Spirit, in order that we may the
more lovingly admire, and the more reverently adore our glorious God.
What a word is that, "the beauty of the Lord!" Think of it, dear reader!
Better far - behold it by faith! What a sight will that be when every
faithful follower of Jesus shall behold "the King in his beauty!" Oh,
for that infinitely blessed vision! "And to enquire in his temple." We
should make our visits to the Lord's house enquirers' meetings. Not
seeking sinners alone, but assured saints should be enquirers. We must
enquire as to the will of God and how we may do it; as to our interest
in the heavenly city, and how we may be more assured of it. We shall not
need to make enquiries in heaven, for there we shall know even as we are
known; but meanwhile we should sit at Jesus' feet, and awaken all our
faculties to learn of him.

[Psa 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#005.md)

This verse gives an excellent reason for the Psalmist's desire after
communion with God, namely, that he was thus secured in the hour of
peril. "For in the time of trouble," that needy time, that time when
others forsake me, "he shall hide me in his pavilion:" he shall give me
the best of shelter in the worst of danger. The royal pavilion was
erected in the centre of the army, and around it all the mighty men kept
guard at all hours; thus in that divine sovereignty which almighty power
is sworn to maintain, the believer peacefully is hidden, hidden not by
himself furtively, but by the king, who hospitably entertains him. "In
the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me." Sacrifice aids
sovereignty in screening the elect from harm. No one of old dared to
enter the most holy place on pain of death; and if the Lord has hidden
his people there, what foe shall venture to molest them? "He shall set
me up upon a rock." Immutability, eternity, and infinite power here come
to the aid of sovereignty and sacrifice. How blessed is the standing of
the man whom God himself sets on high above his foes, upon an
impregnable rock which never can be stormed! Well may we desire to dwell
with the Lord who so effectually protects his people.

[Psa 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#006.md)

"And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about
me." - He is quite sure of it. Godly men of old prayed in faith, nothing
wavering, and spoke of the answer to their prayers as a certainty. David
was by faith so sure of a glorious victory over all those who beset him,
that he arranged in his own heart what he would do when his foes lay all
prostrate before him; that arrangement was such as gratitude suggested.
"Therefore will I offer in his tabernacles sacrifices of joy." That
place for which he longed in his conflict, should see his thankful joy
in his triumphant return. He does not speak of jubilations to be offered
in his palace, and feastings in his banqueting halls, but holy mirth he
selects as most fitting for so divine a deliverance. "I will sing." This
is the most natural mode of expressing thankfulness. "Yea, I will sing
praises unto the Lord." The vow is confirmed by repetition, and
explained by addition, which addition vows all the praise unto Jehovah.
Let who will be silent, the believer when his prayer is heard, must and
will make his praise to be heard also; and let who will sing unto the
vanities of the world, the believer reserves his music for the Lord
alone.

[Psalms 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 27:7</span></span>

7 Hear, O Lord, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and
answer me.

8 When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face,
Lord, will I seek.

9 Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou
hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my
salvation.

10 When my father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me
up.

11 Teach me thy way, O Lord, and lead me in a plain path, because of
mine enemies.

12 Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false
witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty.

[Psa 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#007.md)

"Hear, O Lord, when I cry with my voice." - The pendulum of spirituality
swings from prayer to praise. The voice which in the last verse was
tuned to music is here turned to crying. As a good soldier, David knew
how to handle his weapons, and found himself much at home with the
weapon of "all prayer." Note his anxiety to be heard. Pharisees care not
a fig for the Lord's hearing them, so long as they are heard of men, or
charm their own pride with their sounding devotions; but with a genuine
man, the Lord's ear is everything. The voice may be profitably used even
in private prayer; for though it is unnecessary, it is often helpful,
and aids in preventing distractions. "Have mercy also upon me." Mercy is
the hope of sinners and the refuge of saints. All acceptable petitioners
dwell much upon this attribute. "And answer me." We may expect answers
to prayer, and should not be easy without them any more than we should
be if we had written a letter to a friend upon important business, and
had received no reply.

[Psa 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#008.md)

In this verse we are taught that if we would have the Lord hear our
voice, we must be careful to respond to his voice. The true heart should
echo the will of God as the rocks among the Alps repeat in sweetest
music the notes of the peasant's horn. Observe, that the command was in
the plural, to all the saints, "Seek ye;" but the man of God turned it
into the singular by a personal application, "Thy face, Lord, will I
seek." The voice of the Lord is very effectual where all other voices
fail, "When thou saidst," then my "heart," my inmost nature was moved to
an obedient reply. Note the promptness of the response - no sooner said
than done; as soon as God said "seek," the heart said, "I will seek."
Oh, for more of this holy readiness! Would to God that we were more
plastic to the divine hand, more sensitive of the touch of God's Spirit.

[Psa 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#009.md)

"Hide not thy face far from me." The word "far" is not in the original,
and is a very superfluous addition of the translators, since even the
least hiding of the Lord's face is a great affliction to a believer. The
command to seek the Lord's face would be a painful one if the Lord, by
withdrawing himself, rendered it impossible for the seeker to meet with
him. A smile from the Lord is the greatest of comforts, his frown the
worst of ills. "Put not thy servant away in anger." Other servants had
been put away when they proved unfaithful, as for instance, his
predecessor Saul; and this made David, while conscious of many faults,
most anxious that divine long-suffering should continue him in favour.
This is a most appropriate prayer for us under a similar sense of
unworthiness. "Thou hast been my help." How truly can we join in this
declaration; for many years, in circumstances of varied trial, we have
been upheld by our God, and must and will confess our obligation.
"Ingratitude," it is said, "is natural to fallen man," but to spiritual
men it is unnatural and detestable. "Leave me not, neither forsake me."
A prayer for the future, and an inference front the past. If the Lord
had meant to leave us, why did he begin with us? Past help is but a
waste of effort if the soul now be deserted. The first petition, "leave
me not," may refer to temporary desertions, and the second word to the
final withdrawal of grace, both are to be prayed against; and concerning
the second, we have immutable promises to urge. "O God of my salvation."
A sweet title worthy of much meditation.

[Psa 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#010.md)

"When my father and my mother forsake me." These dear relations will be
the last to desert me, but if the milk of human kindness should dry up
even from their breasts, there is a Father who never forgets. Some of
the greatest of the saints have been cast out by their families, and
persecuted for righteousness' sake. "Then the Lord will take me up."
Will espouse my cause, will uplift me from my woes, will carry me in his
arms, will elevate me above my enemies, will at last receive me to his
eternal dwelling place.

[Psa 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#011.md)

"Teach me thy way, O Lord." He does not pray to be indulged with his own
way, but to be informed as to the path in which the righteous Jehovah
would have him walk. This prayer evinces an humble sense of personal
ignorance, great teachableness of spirit, and cheerful obedience of
heart. "Lead me in a plain path." Help is here sought as well as
direction; we not only need a map of the way, but a guide to assist us
in the journey. A path is here desired which shall be open, honest,
straightforward, in opposition to the way of cunning, which is
intricate, tortuous, dangerous. Good men seldom succeed in fine
speculations and doubtful courses; plain simplicity is the best spirit
for an heir of heaven: let us leave shifty tricks and political
expediencies to the citizens of the world - the New Jerusalem owns plain
men for its citizens. Esau was a cunning hunter, Jacob was a plain man,
dwelling in tents. "Because of mine enemies." These will catch us if
they can, but the way of manifest, simple honesty is safe from their
rage. It is wonderful to observe how honest simplicity baffles and
outwits the craftiness of wickedness. Truth is wisdom. "Honesty is the
best policy."

[Psa 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#012.md)

"Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies;" or I should be like
a victim cast to the lions, to be rent to pieces and utterly devoured.
God be thanked that our foes cannot have their way with us, or
Smithfield would soon be on a blaze again. "For false witnesses are
risen up against me." Slander is an old-fashioned weapon out of the
armoury of hell, and is still in plentiful use; and no matter how holy a
man may be, there will be some who will defame him. "Give a dog an ill
name, and hang him;" but glory be to God, the Lord's people are not
dogs, and their ill names do not injure them. "And such as breathe out
cruelty." It is their vital breath to hate the good; they cannot speak
without cursing them; such was Paul before conversion. They who breathe
out cruelty may well expect to be sent to breathe their native air in
hell; let persecutors beware!

[Psalms 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 27:13</span></span>

13 I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord
in the land of the living.

Faintness of heart is a common infirmity; even he who slew Goliath was
subject to its attacks. Faith puts its bottle of cordial to the lip of
the soul, and so prevents fainting. Hope is heaven's balm for present
sorrow. In this land of the dying, it is our blessedness to be looking
and longing for our fair portion in the land of the living, whence the
goodness of God has banished the wickedness of man, and where holy
spirits charm with their society those persecuted saints who were
vilified and despised among men. We must believe to see, not see to
believe; we must wait the appointed time, and stay our soul's hunger
with foretastes of the Lord's eternal goodness which shall soon be our
feast and our song.

[Psalms 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 27:14</span></span>

14 Wait on the Lord: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine
heart: wait, I say, on the Lord.

"Wait on the Lord." Wait at his door with prayer; wait at his foot with
humility; wait at his table with service; wait at his window with
expectancy. Suitors often win nothing but the cold shoulder from earthly
patrons after long and obsequious waiting; he speeds best whose patron
is in the skies. "Be of good courage." A soldier's motto. Be it mine.
Courage we shall need, and for the exercise of it we have as much reason
as necessity, if we are soldiers of King Jesus. "And he shall strengthen
thine heart." He can lay the plaister right upon the weak place. Let the
heart be strengthened, and the whole machine of humanity is filled with
power; a strong heart makes a strong arm. What strength is this which
God himself gives to the heart? Read the "Book of Martyrs," and see its
glorious deeds of prowess; go to God rather, and get such power thyself.
"Wait, I say, on the Lord." David, in the words "I say," sets his own
private seal to the word which, as an inspired man, he had been moved to
write. It is his testimony as well as the command of God, and indeed he
who writes these scanty notes has himself found it so sweet, so
reviving, so profitable to draw near to God, that on his own account he
also feels bound to write, "Wait, I say, on the Lord."
