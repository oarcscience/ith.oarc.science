### [Psalms Chapter 96](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 96:0</span></span>

Subject. - This Psalm is evidently taken from that sacred song which was
composed by David at the time when "the ark of God was set in the midst
of the tent which David had prepared for it, and they offered burnt
sacrifices and peace offerings before God." See [Ch1
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#001.md). The former part of that sacred
song was probably omitted in this place because it referred to Israel,
and the design of the Holy Ghost in this Psalm was to give forth a song
for the Gentiles, a triumphant hymn wherewith to celebrate the
conversion of the nations to Jehovah in gospel times. It follows fitly
upon the last Psalm, which describes the obstinacy of Israel, and the
consequent taking of the gospel from them that it might be preached
among the nations who would receive it, and in due time be fully won to
Christ by its power. It thus makes a pair with [Psa
95:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#001.md). It is a grand Missionary Hymn,
and it is a wonder that Jews can read it and yet remain exclusive. If
blindness in part had not happened unto Israel, they might have seen
long ago, and would now see, that their God always had designs of love
for all the families of men, and never intended that his grace and his
covenant should relate only to the seed of Abraham after the flesh. We
do not wonder that the large-hearted David rejoiced and danced before
the ark, while he saw in vision all the earth turning from idols to the
one living and true God. Had Michal, Saul's daughter, only been able to
enter into his delight, she would not have reproached him, and if the
Jews at this day could only be enlarged in heart to feel sympathy with
all mankind, they also would sing for joy at the great prophecy that all
the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord.

Divisions. - We will make none, for the song is one and indivisible, a
garment of praise without seam, woven from the top throughout.

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Whole Psalm

What has been said of [Psa 67:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#001.md) may
be fitly applied to the present Psalm. We need not hesitate to add that
it is a millennial anthem. It accords with the condition of the world
when Christ shall sit enthroned in the willing loyalty of our race. The
nations join in an acclaim of praise to him as their rightful Judge and
King. There is a unanimity in the song, as if it ascended from a world
purged into a temple of holiness, and whose inhabitants were indeed a
royal priesthood, with one heart to make Jesus king, with one voice to
sound forth one peal of melody in praise of the name above every name.

Fix the eye for a moment on the precious vision of which we thus catch a
glimpse. It holds true to the deepest principles of our nature, that
what we contemplate as possible, much more what we anticipate as
certain, lends us the very hope and energy conducive to its realisation.
On the contrary, despair paralyses effort. Is it on this account that
everywhere in prophecy, old and new, there floats before us the ideal of
a recovered and rejoicing world, at times transfigured into a loftier
scene, the new heavens and new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness? So
largely did this thought imbue the prophetic mind, that the language of
Paul warms into the animation of poetry, when even "the creature
itself," according to his own vivid personification, like some noble
bird, drooping under the weight Of its chain, with neck outstretched and
eyeball distended, is described as looking down into the vista of coming
time for its deliverance from the bondage of corruption into the
glorious liberty of the sons of God ([Rom
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019).md). He hastens to add, that "we are
saved by hope." It is true of the soul individually, we are saved by
hope. It is true of our race collectively, if ever a millennium is to
dawn upon it, we are saved by such a hope. Our earth may be in ruins
meanwhile, blackness on the sky, barrenness on the soil, because sin is
everywhere; but a change is promised. What we hope for, we labour for
all the more that our hope is no dream of fancy, but has its basis in
the science and certainty of absolute truth. "For as the earth bringeth
forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it
to spring forth; so the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise to
spring forth before all the nations." ([Isa
61:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#011)..md) The tuning of the instrument
is sometimes heard before the music comes. The mother teaches her child
to lisp a hymn before he comprehends its full scope and meaning. And so
here, in this holy Psalm, the Jerusalem from above, the mother of us
all, trains us to the utterance of a song suitable to seasons of
millennial glory, when the Moloch of oppression, the Mammon of our
avarice, the Ashtaroth of fiery lust, every erring creed, every false
religion, shall have given place to the worship of the one true and
living God - to the faith and love of Christ. "Let the peoples praise
thee, O God; let all the peoples praise thee." - W. H. Goold, in "The
Mission Hymn of the Hebrew Church, a Sermon." 1865.

Whole Psalm

This Psalm is entitled in the Septuagint, "A Hymn of David; when the
Temple was rebuilt after the Captivity," and this appears to be a true
description of it; for the substance of it is found in [Ch1
16:23-33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#023.md), where it is described as
having been delivered by David into the hand of Asaph and his brethren,
to thank the Lord when the Ark was brought up to Zion. David's Psalm
here receives a new name, and is called a new song (sir chadash),
because new mercies of God were now to be celebrated; mercies greater
than David had ever received, even when he brought the Ark to Zion. They
who now sang the old song, which had thus become a new song, identified
themselves with David, and identified him with themselves. - Chr.
Wordsworth.

Whole Psalm

Subject. - Call to praise, in view of Christ's second advent and
glorious reign. - To apply it. - Look forward to the glorious day of the
Lord's coming; and realise its approach that you may prepare for it. -
A. R. C. Dallas.

[Psa 96:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md)

"O sing unto the Lord a new song," etc. "A new song," unknown to you
before. Come, all ye nations of the wide earth, who, up to this hour,
have been giving your worship to dead gods that were no gods at all;
come and give your hearts to the true and only God in this new song! -
Henry Cowles.

[Psa 96:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md)

"A new song." It must be "a new canticle," a beautiful canticle, and
elegantly composed; also a canticle for fresh favours; in like manner, a
canticle befitting men who have been regenerated, in whom avarice has
been supplanted by charity: and finally a canticle not like that of
Moses, or Deborah, or any of the old canticles that could not be sung
outside the land of promise, according to [Psa
137:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#001.md), "How shall we sing the Lord's
song in a strange land?" but a new canticle that may be sung all over
the world; and he, therefore, adds, "Sing unto the Lord, all the earth,"
not only Judea, but the whole world. - Bellarmine.

[Psa 96:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md)

"New." The word is used to describe that which is delightful, exquisite,
precious, etc. - Martin Geier.

[Psa 96:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md)

"New." New things are generally most approved, and especially in songs;
for Pindar praises old wine and new songs. - John Cocceius, 1603-1669.

[Psa 96:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md)

"A new song." Our old songs were those of pride, of, gluttony, luxury,
in hope of gain, prosperity, or harm to others; our "new song" is of
praise, reverence, and obedience, and love to God, in newness of life,
in the Spirit that quickeneth, no longer in the letter that killeth, but
keepeth that new commandment, that we love one another, not with the
narrow patriotism and fellow-feeling of a small tribe, or a mere
national church, but with a citizenship which embraces all the whole
earth. - Neale and Littledale.

[Psa 96:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md)

"Sing unto the Lord." We find it thrice said, sing unto the Lord, that
we may understand that we are to sing unto him with mind, and tongue,
and deed. For all these things must be joined together, and the life
ought to correspond with the mouth and mind. As Abbot Absolom says, When
the speech does not jar with the life, there is a sweet harmony. - Le
Blanc.

[Psa 96:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md)

"All the earth." It is a missionary-hymn for all ages of the church; and
it becomes more and more appropriate to our times in proportion as the
heathen begin to respond to the call, "Sing unto the Lord a new song,"
and in proportion as we find in the melancholy condition of the church
at home occasion to look with a hopeful eye towards the heathen world. -
E. W. Hengstenberg.

[Psa 96:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#002.md)

"From day to day." Continually; always. It is a fit subject for
unceasing praise. Every man should praise God every day - on each
returning morning, and on every evening - for the assurance that there
is a way of salvation provided for him, and that he may be happy for
ever. If we had right feelings, this would be the first thought which
would burst upon the mind each morning, irradiating, as with sunbeams,
all around us; and it would be the last thought which would linger in
the soul as we lie down at night, and close our eyes in slumber - making
us grateful, calm, happy, as we sink to rest, for whether we wake or not
in this world, we may be for ever happy. - Albert Barnes.

[Psa 96:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#002.md)

"From day to day." Other news delights us only at first hearing; but the
good news of our redemption is sweet from day to day, ac si in eodem die
redemptio fuisset operata, saith Kimchi here, as if it were done but
to-day. Tam recens mihi nunc Christus est, saith Luther, ac si hac hora
fudisset sanguinem, Christ is now as fresh unto me as if he had shed his
blood but this very hour. - John Trapp.

[Psa 96:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#003.md)

"Declare." The corresponding word is a book; and the participle is often
rendered a scribe, a writer, [Psa
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#001.md). The verb is rendered, tell, shew
forth, declare. The variety of verbs used in [Psa
96:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md), proves that we are to employ
all proper means for making known the Saviour. One of these methods is
by writing. - W. S. Plumer.

[Psa 96:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#003.md)

"Declare his glory" - what a glorious person the Messiah is; the
brightness of his Father's glory; having all the perfections of Deity in
him; how the glory of God appears in him, and in all that he has done;
and especially in the work of redemption, in which the glory of divine
wisdom power, justice, truth, and faithfulness, love, grace, and mercy,
is richly displayed; say what glory he is advanced unto, having done his
work, being highly exalted, set at the right hand of God, and crowned
with glory and honour, and what a fulness of grace there is in him, for
the supply of his people; and what a glory is on him, which they shall
behold to all eternity. - John Gill.

[Psa 96:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#003.md)

His glory shines from every ray of light that reaches us from a thousand
stars; it sparkles from the mountain tops that reflect the earliest and
retain the last rays of the rising and the setting sun; it spreads over
the expanse of the sea, and speaks in the murmur of its restless waves;
it girdles the earth with a zone of light, and flings over it an aureole
of beauty. In the varied forms of animal tribes; in the relations of our
world to other worlds, in the revolutions of planets, in the springing
of flowers, in the fall of waters, and in the flight of birds; in the
sea, the rivers, and the air; in heights and depths, in wonders and
mysteries, - Christ wears the crown, sways the sceptre, and receives
from all a tribute to his sovereignty. We cannot augment it; we cannot
add one ray of light to the faintness of a distant star, nor give wings
to an apterous insect, nor change a white hair into black. We can
unfold, but not create; we can adore, but not increase; we can recognise
the footprints of Deity, but not add to them. - John Cumming in "From
Patmos to Paradise, 1873."

[Psa 96:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#003.md)

"Declare his glory among the heathen," etc. It is a part of the
commission given to the ministers of the gospel, not only to teach their
congregations concerning Christ, but also to have a care that they who
never did hear of him, may know what he is, what he hath done and
suffered, and what good may be had by his mediation. Nothing so glorious
to God, nothing so wonderful in itself, as is the salvation of man by
Christ; to behold God saving his enemies by the incarnation, sufferings,
and obedience of Christ the eternal Son of God: "Declare his glory among
the heathen, his wonders among all people." - David Dickson.

[Psa 96:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#003.md)

"Declare his glory." It is his glory which should be proclaimed, not the
learning, ability, and eloquence of the orator who professes to speak
for him; it is his glory, the loving beauty, the attractiveness of his
gospel, the lavish promises to repentant sinners, the blessedness of
heaven, which should be the chief themes of discourse; not threats,
menaces, sermons on hell or torment to affright men, and at best make
them God's trembling slaves, not his loving friends. The preaching is to
be "unto all people," in obscure country districts, amongst unpolished
and illiterate congregations, and not to be confined, as fashionable
preachers like to confine it, to the cultivated and critical audiences
of the capital. - Hugo, quoted by Neale and Littledale.

[Psa 96:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#003.md)

"His glory." What he had before called salvation, he now names glory,
and afterwards wonders. And since this salvation, whereby the human race
is redeemed from eternal death and damnation, is glorious and full of
wonders, it is therefore worthy of admiration and praise. - Mollerus.

[Psa 96:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#003.md)

"His wonders." What a wonderful person he is, for he is God manifest in
the flesh; what wonderful love he has shown in his incarnation,
obedience, sufferings, and death; what amazing miracles he wrought, and
what a wonderful work he performed; the work of our redemption, the
wonder of men and angels; declare his wonderful resurrection from the
dead, his ascension to heaven, sitting at the right hand of God, and
intercession for his people; the wonderful effusion of his Spirit, and
the conquests of his grace, and the enlargement of his kingdom in the
world; as also what wonders will be wrought by him when he appears a
second time; how the dead will be raised, and all will be Judged. - John
Gill.

[Psa 96:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#005.md)

"For all the gods of the nations are idols." Nothings, nonentities, a
favourite description of idols in Isaiah's later prophecies. See e.g.
[Isa 41:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#024.md), and compare [Lev
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#004.md), [Lev
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#001.md), [Co1
8:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#004.md), [Co1
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#019.md). A less probable etymology of
the Hebrew word makes it a diminutive of (אל) El, analogous to godlings
as an expression of contempt. - J. A. Alexander.

[Psa 96:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#005.md)

"The gods of the nations are idols." Their Elohim are elilim. See [Ch1
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#026.md). The word elilim occurs in two
places in the Psalms, here and [Psa
97:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#007.md). It is used most frequently by
Isaiah, and properly signifies nothings, as St. Paul says, "an idol is
nothing." ([Co1 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#004)..md) - Chr.
Wordsworth.

[Psa 96:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#005.md)

"The Lord made the heavens." [Psa 96:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#005.md)
is a notandum. What a tribute to astronomy is it that the Lord is so
often done homage to as having made the heavens! Let the theology of
nature be blended with the theology of conscience - a full recognition
of the strength and the glory which shine palpably forth in the wonders
of creation, with the spiritual offerings of holy worship and holy
service. - Thomas Chalmers.

[Psa 96:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#006.md)

"Beauty ... in his sanctuary."

Oh, if so much of beauty doth reveal

Itself in every vein of life and nature,

How beautiful must be the Source itself,

The Ever-Bright One!

\- Esaias Tegner, 1782-1847.

[Psa 96:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#006.md)

"In his sanctuary." That is to say

\(1\) his ark, tabernacle, or temple, as many writers consider. Kimchi,
as quoted by Muis, suggests that where joy or beauty is mentioned as
being in his temple, it is set in opposition to the perpetual grief of
the Philistines when the ark was in their cities. They saw the Lord's
strength, but not his beauty.

\(2\) Others refer the word sanctuary to the church of Christ, which, as
Munster remarks, is adorned with heavenly ornaments, and was typified by
the magnificence of Solomon's temple. Certainly it is in the church that
the spiritual power and beauty of the Lord are to be most clearly seen.

\(3\) The passage may refer to heaven, where the divine presence is more
peculiarly manifest. - C. H. S.

[Psa 96:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#007.md)

"Ye kindreds of the people." There is a peculiar force, observes an
early commentator \[Cassiodorus\], in this phrase, "kindreds of the
people," much more than if we had the word "peoples" alone; for in every
nation there are at all times Strangers, aliens, sojourners abiding
permanently or for a time, but not reckoned among the natives; while the
phrase here includes all such and provides that none shall be shut out
because of his origin. - Neale and Littledale.

[Psa 96:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#007.md)

"Ye kindreds of the people." He calls upon them to come in kindreds or
families, in allusion to the Jewish custom of families coming by
themselves on the several festival days to worship in Jerusalem; and the
Holy Ghost gives us here to understand that such custom was to serve as
a model for Christians, whose families should unite in coming to the
church to give glory and honour to God for all the wonderful things he
accomplished in the redemption of man; for it was not by our own
industry, or by our merits, that we have come to grace, and to be the
adopted children of God, but through God's mercy, to whom, therefore, is
due all honour and glory. - Bellarmine.

[Psa 96:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#008.md)

"Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name." It is a debt; and a
debt, in equity, must be paid. The honour due to his name is to
acknowledge him to be holy, just, true, powerful, "The Lord, the
faithful God,.... good, merciful, long-suffering," etc. Defraud not his
name of the least honour. - Adam Clarke.

[Psa 96:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#008.md)

"Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name." Is all the glory due
unto God's name, and ought it, in strict justice, to have been ascribed
unto him by men, ever since man began to exist? How immeasurably great
then is the debt which our world has contracted, and under the burden of
which it now groans! During every day and every hour which has elapsed
since the apostasy of man, this debt has been increasing; for every day
and every hour all men ought to have given unto Jehovah the glory which
is due to his name. But no man has ever done this fully. And a vast
proportion of our race have never done it at all. Now the difference
between the tribute which men ought to have paid to God and that which
they actually have paid constitutes the debt of which we are speaking.
How vast, then, how incalculable is it! - Edward Payson.

[Psa 96:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#008.md)

"Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name." Every glory will not
serve the turn, but such glory as is proper and peculiar for that God we
serve. It is a stated rule in Scripture that, respects to God must be
proportioned to the nature of God. God is a spirit, therefore will be
worshipped in spirit and truth. God is a God of peace, therefore lift up
pure hands, without wrath and doubting. God is a holy God, therefore
will be sanctified. They which worship the sun, among the heathens, they
used a flying horse, as a thing most suitable to the swift motion of the
sun. Well, then, they that will glorify and honour God with a glory due
to his name, must sanctify him as well as honour him. Why? For "God is
glorious in holiness," [Exo 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#011.md).
This is that which God counteth to be his chief excellency, and the
glory which he will manifest among the sons of men. - Thomas Manton.

[Psa 96:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#008.md)

"Bring an offering." This is language taken from the temple-worship, and
means that God is to be worshipped, in the manner which he has
prescribed, as a suitable expression of his majesty. The word here
rendered "offering" - מנחה, minkhah - is that which is commonly used to
denote a bloodless offering, a thank-offering. - Albert Barnes.

[Psa 96:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#009.md)

"In the beauty of holiness," or, in the ornament of holiness, alluding
to the splendid robes of eastern worshippers. - W. Wilson.

[Psa 96:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#009.md)

"The beauty of holiness." Shall I call holiness an attribute? Is it not
rather the glorious combination of all his attributes into one perfect
whole? As all his attributes proceed from the absolute, so all again
converge and meet in holiness. As from the insufferable white light of
the Absolute they all seem to diverge and separate into prismatic hues,
so they all seem again to converge and meet and combine in the dazzling
white radiance of his holiness. This, therefore, is rather the intense
whiteness, purity, clearness, the infinite lustre and splendour of his
perfect nature - like a gem without flaw, without stain, and without
colour. All of his attributes are glorious, but in this we have a
combination of all into a still more glorious whole. It is for this
reason that it is so frequently in Scripture associated with the Divine
beauty. The poetic nature of the Psalmist is exalted to ecstasy in
contemplation of the "beauty of holiness," the "beauty of the Lord."
Beauty is a combination of elements according to the laws of harmony;
the more beautiful the parts or elements, and the more perfect the
harmonious combination, the higher the beauty. How high and glorious,
therefore, must be the beauty of this attribute which is the perfect
combination of all his infinite perfections!

You see, then, why this attribute is awful to us. In the ideal man all
the faculties and powers, mental, moral, and bodily, work together in
perfect harmony, making sweet music - the image of God is clear and pure
in the human heart. But, alas! how far are we from the ideal! In the
actual man the purity is stained, the beauty is defaced, the harmony is
changed into jarring discord, "like sweet bells jangled out of tune."
How it came so, we are not now inquiring. We all feel that it is so.
Therefore is this attribute so awful to us. It is the awfulness of
absolute purity in the presence of impurity; it is the awfulness of
perfect beauty in the presence of deformity; it is the awfulness of
honour in the presence of dishonour and shame; in one word, it is the
awfulness of holiness in the presence of sinfulness. How, then, shall we
approach him before whom angels bow and archangels veil their faces -
him in whose sight the white radiance of heaven itself is stained with
impurity? - Joseph Le Coute, in "Religion and Science," 1874.

[Psa 96:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#009.md)

"The beauty of holiness." The religion of the gospel of Christ is "the
beauty of holiness," as it concerns its Author, its plan, its fruits.
1st, As it concerns its Author. Whatever we can understand as meant by
beauty or holiness, we see in the attributes of God, whether we consider
them in all their harmony, or contemplate any one of them in
particular....2ndly, As to its plan. Survey the gospel where we will, or
regard whatever we can that is revealed concerning it, we find it to be
all "beauty"; and we cannot call it by a more appropriate name than "the
beauty of holiness." 3rdly, As to its fruits. There is a holy
separation, a beautiful character of holiness, a separation as to
character, feelings, and conduct; these are all the various fruits of
grace; and so the man becomes beautiful in holiness. - Legh Richmond,
1772-1827.

[Psa 96:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#010.md)

"Say among the heathen that the Lord reigneth." This clause reads in the
old Latin version, "Tell it out among the heathen, that the Lord
reigneth from the tree." Justin Martyr accuses the Jews, that they have
erased the words "a ligno," ἀπὸ ξύλου, which are wanting in the original
and in the Septuagint. Mrs. Charles renders the verse thus: -

"The truth that David learned to sing,

Its deep fulfilment here attains;

'Tell all the earth the Lord is King!'

Lo, from the cross, a King he reigns!"

\- From "Christ in Song. Hymns of Immanuel, with Notes by P. Schaff,"
1870.

[Psa 96:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#010.md)

"Say among the heathen that the Lord reigneth." It is not enough to feel
desire; we must "say among the heathen, the Lord reigneth." There is a
commandment given us of the Lord to "go into all the world, and preach
the gospel to every creature" - to tell them what Christ hath taught us
- to say to them, in fact, "The Lord reigneth."

We go among the heathen, and say, "the Lord reigneth" - point them to
all the various objects in creation - to the stars of heaven, to the
beauties of vegetation, to the daily occurrences of providence, to the
body fearfully and wonderfully made, to its continual preservation and
supply. We may easily take our text from every thing by which we are
surrounded, and say, "The Lord reigneth." But we must not stop here. It
is well to have right views of God as the Creator; but it is only as we
view him as the God of Redemption, that we can praise him "in the beauty
of holiness." - Legh Richmond.

[Psa 96:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#010.md)

"Say among the heathen that the Lord reigneth" must be the Christian's
as it was the Israelite's motto. The earliest preaching of our Saviour
and his disciples was the preaching of the gospel of: the kingdom. It
was because all power was given unto him in heaven and in earth, that,
after his resurrection from the dead, Jesus sent forth his apostles to
go and teach all nations. The substance of the apostles' subsequent
preaching was, confessedly, the kingdom of God. - J. F. Thrupp.

[Psa 96:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#010.md)

"Say among the heathen." Go, ye that are already become proselytes unto
him, and publish everywhere, in all countries, that the Lord \[Christ\]
is the sovereign of the world, who alone can make it happy: for he shall
settle those in peace that submit unto his government: and they shall
not be so disturbed as they were wont with wars and tumults; he shall
administer equal justice unto all; and neither suffer the good to be
unrewarded, nor the evil to escape unpunished. - Symon Patrick.

[Psa 96:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#010.md)

"The world also," etc. The natural world shall be established; the
standing of the world, and its stability, is owing to the mediation of
Christ. Sin had given it a shock, and still threatens it; but Christ, as
redeemer, upholds all things, and preserves the course of nature. The
world of mankind shall be established, shall be preserved, till all that
belong to the election of grace are called in, though a guilty,
provoking world. The Christian religion, as far as it is embraced, shall
establish states and kingdoms, and preserve good order among men. The
church in the world shall be established, that it cannot be moved, for
it is built upon a rock, and the gates of hell shall never prevail
against it; it is a "kingdom that cannot be shaken." - Matthew Henry.

[Psa 96:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#010.md)

"It shall not be moved." When we learn from the records of geology, as
they are inscribed upon the rocks, how numerous and thorough have been
the revolutions of the surface and the crust of the globe in past ages;
how often and how long the present dry land has been alternately above
and beneath the ocean; how frequently the crust of the globe has been
fractured, bent, and dislocated; now lifted upward, and now thrown
downward, and now folded by lateral pressure; how frequently melted
matter has been forced through its strata and through its fissures to
the surface; in short, how every particle of the accessible portions of
the globe has undergone entire metamorphoses; and especially when we
recollect what strong evidence there is that oceans of liquid matter
exist beneath the solid crust, and that probably the whole interior of
the earth is in that condition, with expansive energy sufficient to rend
the globe into fragments; when we review all these facts, we cannot but
feel that the condition of the surface of the globe must be one of great
insecurity and liability to change. But it is not so. On the contrary,
the present state of the globe is one of permanent uniformity and entire
security, except those comparatively slight catastrophes which result
from earthquakes, volcanoes, and local deluges. Even the climate has
experienced no general change within historic times, and the profound
mathematical researches of Baron Fourier have demonstrated that, even
though the internal parts of the globe are in an incandescent state,
beneath a crust thirty or forty miles, the temperature of the surface
has long since ceased to be affected by the melted central mass; that it
is not now more than one seventeenth of a degree higher than it would be
if the interior were ice; and that hundreds of thousands of years will
not see it lowered, from this cause, more than the seventeenth part of a
degree. And as to the apprehension that the entire crust of the globe
may be broken through, and fall into the melted matter beneath, just
reflect what solidity and strength there must be in a mass of hard rock
from fifty to one hundred miles in thickness, and your fears of such a
catastrophe will probably vanish.

Now, such a uniformity of climate and security from general ruin are
essential to the comfort and existence of animal nature. But it must
have required infinite wisdom and benevolence so to arrange and balance
the mighty elements of change and ruin which exist in the earth, that
they should hold one another in check, and make the world a quiet,
unchanged, and secure dwelling-place for so many thousands of years.
Surely that wisdom must have been guided by infinite benevolence. -
Edward Hitchcock, in "The Religion of Geology," 1851.

[Psa 96:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#011.md)

"Let the heavens rejoice." As the whole creation, both animate and
inanimate, has groaned beneath the weight of the curse, so shall the
whole creation partake of the great deliverance. - "The Speaker's
Commentary," 1873.

[Psa 96:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#011.md)

"Let the sea roar." -

Thou paragon of elemental powers,

Mystery of waters - never-slumbering sea!

Impassioned orator with lips sublime,

Whose waves are arguments which prove a God!

Robert Montgomery, 1807-1855.

[Psa 96:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#011.md), [Psa
96:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#012.md)

God will graciously accept the holy joys and praises of all the hearty
well-wishers to the kingdom of Christ, be their capacity never so mean.
"The sea" can but "roar," and how "the trees of the wood" can shew that
they "rejoice," I know not; but "he that searcheth the heart, knows what
is the mind of the Spirit," and understands the language, the broken
language of the weakest. - Matthew Henry.

[Psa 96:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#011.md)

These verses are full of comprehensive beauty and power. They present
the gathering together of everything under the confessed dominion of the
reigning Christ. Things in heaven, as well as things on earth, rejoice
together in the acknowledged blessing of the Lord of peace. The Psalm is
throughout a very sweet strain of millennial prophecy. - Arthur Pridham.

[Psa 96:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#011.md)

Nothing can excel that noble exultation of universal nature in the 96th
Psalm, which has been so often commended, where the whole animate and
inanimate creation unite in the praises of their Maker. Poetry here
seems to assume the highest tone of triumph and exultation, and to
revel, if I may so express myself, in all the extravagance of joy. -
Robert Lowth.

[Psa 96:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#011.md)

Although there are some who by heaven understand angels; by the earth,
men; by the sea, troublesome spirits; by trees and fields, the Gentiles
who were to believe, yet this need not be thought strange, because such
prosopopoeias are frequent in Scripture. - Adam Clarke.

[Psa 96:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#012.md)

"Let the field be joyful," etc. Let the husbandmen, and the shepherds,
and all that dwell in the fields, leap for joy; and the woodmen and
foresters shout for joy, to see the happy day approaching; when all the
idols that are worshipped there shall be thrown down together with their
groves. - Simon Patrick.

[Psa 96:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#012.md)

"Rejoice." The verb רנו expresses the vibratory motion, either of a
dancer's feet, or of a singer's lip. - Samuel Horsley.

"The trees of the wood."

His praise, ye winds, that from four quarters blow,

Breathe soft or loud; and wave your tops, ye Pines,

With every plant, in sign of worship wave.

John Milton.

"He cometh," etc.

It chanced upon the merry, merry Christmas eve,

I went sighing past the church across the moorland dreary -

"Oh! never sin and want and woe this earth will leave,

And the bells but mock the wailing round, they sing so cheery

How long, O Lord! how long before thou come again?

Still in cellar, and in garret, and on moorland dreary

The orphans moan, and widows weep, and poor men toil in vain,

Till earth is sick of hope deferred, though Christmas bells be cheery."

Then arose a joyous clamour from the wild fowl on the mere,

Beneath the stars, across the snow, like clear bells ringing,

And a voice within cried, "Listen! Christmas carols even here!

Though thou be dumb, yet o'er their work the stars and snows are
singing.

Blind! I live, I love, I reign: and all the nations through

With the thunder of my judgments even now are ringing;

Do thou fulfil thy work but as yon wild fowl do,

Thou wilt heed no less the wailing, yet hear through it angels singing."

Charles Kingsley, 1858.

[Psa 96:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#013.md)

"For he cometh, for he cometh." Because the thing was hard to be
believed, the Prophet asserts twice that God should come, that he should
be Judge and King, and Governor of all. - Martinus Bucerus in Expos.
Ecclesiast.

[Psa 96:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#013.md)

"He cometh." Not יבוא, "He shall come;" but בּא לשׁפּט, "He cometh;" to
show how near the time is. It is almost day-break, and the court is
ready to sit: "The Judge standeth at the door," [Jam
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#009.md). - Thomas Watson.

[Psa 96:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#013.md)

"To judge." Vatablus remarks that to judge is the word used instead of
to reign, judicare pro regere, because judges in the early days of the
Holy Land exercised the power both of kings and magistrates. The Lord
comes to be to all nations a wiser judge than Samuel, a greater champion
than Samson, a mightier deliverer than Gideon. - C. H. S.

[Psa 96:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#013.md)

"He cometh to judge the earth." That is, to put earth in order, to be
its Gideon and Samson, to be its ruler, to fulfil all that the Book of
Judges delineates of a judge's office. It is, as Hengstenberg says, "a
gracious judging," not a time of mere adjudication of causes or
pronouncing sentences - it is a day of jubilee. It is the happiest day
our world has ever seen. Who would not long for it? Who is there that
does not pray for it? It is the day of the Judge's glory, as well as of
our world's freedom - the day when "the judgment of this world" ([Joh
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031.md), and [Joh
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#011).md), which his cross began and made
sure, is completed by the total suppression of Satan's reign, and the
removal of the curse. All this is anticipated here; and so we entitle
this Psalm, The glory due to him who cometh to judge the earth. - Andrew
A. Bonar.

[Psa 96:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#013.md)

"He cometh to judge the earth," etc. In this new song they take up the
words of Enoch, the seventh from Adam ([Jde
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#014).md), who preached of the Coming of
the Lord to judge the world. - Chr. Wordsworth.

[Psalms 96:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 96:1</span></span>

1 O Sing unto the Lord) a new song; sing unto the Lord, all the earth.

2 Sing unto the Lord, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from

day to day.

3 Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people.

4 For the Lord is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared
above all gods.

5 For all the gods of the nations are idols; but the Lord made the
heavens.

6 Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his

sanctuary.

7 Give unto the Lord, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the Lord
glory and strength.

8 Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name; bring an offering, and
come into his courts.

9 O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the
earth.

10 Say among the heathen that the Lord reigneth: the world also shall be
established that it shall not be moved; he shall judge the people
righteously:

11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar,
and the fulness thereof.

12 Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all the
trees of the wood rejoice

13 Before the Lord: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he
shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.

[Psa 96:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md)

"O sing unto the Lord a new song." New joys are filling the hearts of
men, for the glad tidings of blessing to all people are proclaimed,
therefore let them sing a new song. Angels inaugurated the new
dispensation with new songs, and shall not we take up the strain? The
song is for Jehovah alone, the hymns which chanted the praises of
Jupiter and Neptune, Vishnoo and Siva are hushed for ever; Bacchanalian
shouts are silenced, lascivious sonnets are no more. Unto the one only
God all music is to be dedicated. Mourning is over, and the time of the
singing of hearts has come. No dismal rites are celebrated, no bloody
sacrifices of human beings are presented, no cutting with knives, and
outcries of lamentation are presented by deluded rotaries. Joy is in the
ascendant, and singing has become the universal expression of love, the
fitting voice of reverent adoration. Men are made new creatures, and
their song is new also. The names of Baalim are no more on their lips,
the wanton music of Ashtaroth ceaseth; the foolish ditty and the cruel
war-song are alike forgotten; the song is holy, heavenly, pure, and
pleasant. The Psalmist speaks as if he would lead the strain and be the
chief musician, he invites, he incites, he persuades to sacred worship,
and cries with all his heart, "O sing unto Jehovah a new song."

"Sing unto the Lord, all the earth." - National jealousies are dead; a
Jew invites the Gentiles to adore, and joins with them, so that all the
earth may lift up one common Psalm as with one heart and voice unto
Jehovah, who hath visited it with his salvation. No corner of the world
is to be discordant, no race of heathen to be dumb. All the earth
Jehovah made, and all the earth must sing to him. As the sun shines on
all lands, so are all lands to delight in the light of the Sun of
Righteousness. E Pluribus Unum, out of many one song shall come forth.
The multitudinous languages of the sons of Adam, who were scattered at
Babel, will blend in the same song when the people are gathered at Zion.
Nor men alone, but the earth itself is to praise its Maker. Made subject
to vanity for a while by a sad necessity, the creation itself also is to
be delivered from the bondage of corruption, and brought into the
glorious liberty of the children of God, so that sea and forest, field
and flood, are to be joyful before the Lord. Is this a dream? then let
us dream again. Blessed are the eyes which shall see the kingdom, and
the ears which shall hear its songs. Hasten thine advent, good Lord!
Yea, send forth speedily the rod of thy strength out of Zion, that the
nations may bow before the Lord and his Anointed.

[Psa 96:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#002.md)

"Sing unto the Lord, bless his name." Thrice is the name of the Lord
repeated, and not without meaning. Is it not unto the Three-One Lord
that the enlightened nations will sing? Unitarianism is the religion of
units; it is too cold to warm the world to worship; the sacred fire of
adoration only burns with vehement flame where the Trinity is believed
in and beloved. In other ways beside singing, the blessed Lord is to be
blessed. His name, his fame, his character, his revealed word and will
are to be delighted in, and remembered with perpetual thanksgiving. We
may well bless him who so divinely blesses us. At the very mention of
his name it is meet to say, "Let him be blessed for ever." "Shew forth
his salvation from day to day." The gospel is the clearest revelation of
himself, salvation outshines creation and providence; therefore let our
praises overflow in that direction. Let us proclaim the glad tidings,
and do so continually, never ceasing the blissful testimony. It is ever
new, ever suitable, ever sure, ever perfect; therefore let us show it
forth continually until he come, both by words and deeds, by songs and
sermons, by sacred Baptism and by the Holy Supper, by books and by
speech, by Sabbath services and week-day worship. Each day brings us
deeper experience of our saving God, each day shows us anew how deeply
men need his salvation, each day reveals the power of the gospel, each
day the Spirit strives with the sons of men; therefore, never pausing,
be it ours to tell out the glorious message of free grace. Let those do
this who know for themselves what his salvation means; they can bear
witness that there is salvation in none other, and that in him salvation
to the uttermost is to be found. Let them show it forth till the echo
flies around the spacious earth, and all the armies of the sky unite to
magnify the God who hath displayed his saving health among all people.

[Psa 96:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#003.md)

"Declare his glory among the heathen." His salvation is his glory, the
word of the gospel glorifies him; and this should be published far and
wide, till the remotest nations of the earth have known it. England has
spent much blood and treasure to keep up her own prestige among
barbarians; when will she be equally anxious to maintain the honour of
her religion, the glory of her Lord? It is to be feared that too often
the name of the Lord Jesus has been dishonoured among the heathen by the
vices and cruelties of those who call themselves Christians; may this
fact excite true believers to greater diligence in causing the gospel to
be proclaimed as with a trumpet in all quarters of the habitable globe.
"His wonders among all people." The gospel is a mass of wonders, its
history is full of wonders, and it is in itself far more marvellous than
miracles themselves. In the person of his Son the Lord has displayed
wonders of love, wisdom, grace, and power. All glory be unto his name;
who can refuse to tell out the story of redeeming grace and dying love?
All the nations need to hear of God's marvellous works; and a really
living, self-denying church would solemnly resolve that right speedily
they all shall hear thereof. The tribes which are dying out are not to
be excluded from gospel teaching any more than the great growing
families which, like the fat kine of Pharaoh, are eating up other races:
Red Indians as well as Anglo-Saxons are to hear of the wonders of
redeeming love. None are too degraded, none too cultured, none too
savage, and none too refined.

[Psa 96:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#004.md)

"For the Lord is great and greatly to be praised." He is no petty deity,
presiding, as the heathen imagined their gods to do, over some one
nation, or one department of nature. Jehovah is great in power and
dominion, great in mind and act; nothing mean or narrow can be found in
him or his acts, in all things he is infinite. Praise should be
proportionate to its object, therefore let it be infinite when rendered
unto the Lord. We cannot praise him too much, too often, too zealously,
too carefully, too joyfully. He deserves that nothing in his worship
should be little, but all the honour rendered unto him should be given
in largeness of heart, with the utmost zeal for his glory. "He is to be
feared above all gods." Other gods have been worshipped at great cost,
and with much fervour, by their blinded votaries, but Jehovah should be
adored with far greater reverence. Even if the graven images had been
gods they could not have borne comparison for an instant with the God of
Israel, and therefore his worship should be far more zealous than any
which has been rendered to them. He is to be feared, for there is cause
to fear. Dread of other gods is mere superstition, awe of the Lord is
pure religion. Holy fear is the beginning of the graces, and yet it is
the accompaniment of their highest range. Fear of God is the blush upon
the face of holiness enhancing its beauty.

[Psa 96:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#005.md)

"For all the gods of the nations are idols." Mere images of wood and
stone, vanities, nothings. "But the Lord made the heavens." The reality
of his Godhead is proved by his works, and foremost among these the
Psalmist mentions that matchless piece of architecture which casts its
arch over every man's head, whose lamps are the light of all mankind,
whose rains and dew fall upon the fields of every people, and whence the
Lord in voice of thunder is heard speaking to every creature. The idol
gods have no existence, but our God is the author of all existences;
they are mere earthly vanities, while he is not only heavenly, but made
the heavens. This is mentioned as an argument for Jehovah's universal
praise. Who can be worshipped but he? Since none can rival him, let him
be adored alone.

[Psa 96:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#006.md)

"Honour and majesty are before him." Men can but mimic these things;
their pompous pageants are but the pretence of greatness. Honour and
majesty are with him and with him alone. In the presence of Jehovah real
glory and sovereignty abide, as constant attendants. "Strength and
beauty are in his sanctuary." In him are combined all that is mighty and
lovely, powerful and resplendent. We have seen rugged strength devoid of
beauty, we have also seen elegance without strength; the union of the
two is greatly to be admired. Do we desire to see the "sublime and
beautiful" at one glance? Then we must look to the eternal throne. In
the Chronicles we read strength and gladness; and the two renderings do
not disagree in sense, for in the highest degree in this instance it is
true that "a thing of beauty is a joy for ever." Not in outward show or
parade of costly robes does the glory of God consist; such things are
tricks of state with which the ignorant are dazzled; holiness, justice,
wisdom, grace, these are the splendours of Jehovah's courts, these the
jewels and the gold, the regalia, and the pomp of the courts of heaven.

[Psa 96:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#007.md)

[Psa 96:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md) commenced with an
exhortation to sing, three times repeated, with the name of the Lord
thrice mentioned; here we meet with the expression "Give unto the Lord,"
used in the same triple manner. This is after the manner of those poets
whose flaming sonnets have best won the ear of the people, they
reiterate choice words till they penetrate the soul and fire the heart.
The invocation of the sweet singer is still addressed to all mankind, to
whom he speaks as "Ye kindreds of the people." Divided into tribes and
families, we are called in our courses and order to appear before him
and ascribe to him all honour. "All worship be to God only," is the
motto of one of our City companies, and it may well be the motto of all
the families upon earth. Family worship is peculiarly pleasing unto him
who is the God of all the families of Israel. "Give unto the Lord glory
and strength," that is to say, recognise the glory and power of Jehovah,
and ascribe them unto him in your solemn hymns. Who is glorious but the
Lord? Who is strong, save our God? Ye great nations, who count
yourselves both famous and mighty, cease your boastings! Ye monarchs,
who are styled imperial and puissant, humble yourselves in the dust
before the only Potentate. Glory and strength are nowhere to be found,
save with the Lord, all others possess but the semblance thereof. Well
did Massillon declare, "God alone is great."

[Psa 96:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#008.md)

"Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name." But who can do that to
the full? Can all the nations of the earth put together discharge the
mighty debt? All conceivable honour is due to our Creator, Preserver,
Benefactor, and Redeemer, and however much of zealous homage we may
offer to him, we cannot give him more than his due. If we cannot bring
in the full revenue which he justly claims, at least let us not fail
from want of honest endeavour. "Bring an offering, and come into his
courts." Come with an unbloody sacrifice; atonement for sin having been
made, it only remains to bring thank-offerings, and let not these be
forgotten. To him who gives us all, we ought gladly to give our grateful
tithe. When assembling for public worship we should make a point of
bringing with us a contribution to his cause, according to that ancient
word, "None of you shall appear before me empty." The time will come
when from all ranks and all nations the Lord will receive gifts when
they gather together for his worship. O long expected day begin!

[Psa 96:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#009.md)

"O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness." This is the only beauty
which he cares for in our public services, and it is one for which no
other can compensate. Beauty of architecture and apparel he does not
regard; moral and spiritual beauty is that in which his soul delighteth.
Worship must not be rendered to God in a slovenly, sinful, superficial
manner; we must be reverent, sincere, earnest, and pure in heart both in
our prayers and praises. Purity is the white linen of the Lord's
choristers, righteousness is the comely garment of his priests, holiness
is the royal apparel of his servitors. "Fear before him, all the earth."
"Tremble" is the word in the original, and it expresses the profoundest
awe, just as the word "worship" does, which would be more accurately
translated by "bow down." Even the bodily frame would be moved to
trembling and prostration if men were thoroughly conscious of the power
and glory of Jehovah. Men of the world ridiculed "the Quakers" for
trembling when under the power of the Holy Spirit; had they been able to
discern the majesty of the Eternal they would have quaked also. There is
a sacred trembling which is quite consistent with joy, the heart may
even quiver with an awful excess of delight. The sight of the King in
his beauty caused no alarm to John in Patmos, and yet it made him fall
at his feet as dead. Oh, to behold him and worship him with prostrate
awe and sacred fear!

[Psa 96:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#010.md)

"Say among the heathen that the Lord reigneth." This is the gladdest
news which can be carried to them, - the Lord Jehovah, in the person of
his Son has assumed the throne, and taken to himself his great power.
Tell this out among the heathen, and let the heathen themselves, being
converted, repeat the same rejoicingly. The dominion of Jehovah Jesus is
not irksome, his rule is fraught with untold blessings, his yoke is
easy, and his burden is light. "The world also shall be established that
it shall not be moved." Society is safe where God is king, no
revolutions shall convulse his empire, no invasions shall disturb his
kingdom. A settled government is essential to national prosperity, the
reign of the God of truth and righteousness will promote this to the
highest degree. Sin has shaken the world, the reign of Jesus will set it
fast again upon sure foundations. "He shall judge the people
righteously." This is the best method for establishing society on a
secure basis, and this is the greatest source of joy to oppressed
nations. Iniquity makes the dynasties of tyrants fall, equity causes the
throne of Jesus to stand. He will impartially rule over Jew and Gentile,
prince and peasant, and this will bring happiness to those who are now
the victims of the despot's arbitrary will.

[Psa 96:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#011.md)

"Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad." Above and below
let the joy be manifested. Let the angels who have stood in amaze at the
wickedness of men, now rejoice over their repentance and restoration to
favour, and let men themselves express their pleasure in seeing their
true prince set upon his throne. The book of creation has two covers,
and on each of these let the glory of the Lord be emblazoned in letters
of joy. "Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof." Let it be no more a
troubled sea, wailing over ship-wrecked mariners, and rehearsing the
griefs of widows and orphans, but let it adopt a cheerful note, and
rejoice in the kingdom of the Lord. Let it thunder out the name of the
Lord when its tides are at its full, and let all its teeming life
express the utmost joy because the Lord reigneth even in the depth of
the sea. In common with the rest of the creation, the sea has groaned
and travailed until now: is not the time close at hand in which its
hollow murmur shall be exchanged for an outburst of joy? Will not every
billow soon flash forth the praises of him who once trod the sea?

"Waft, waft, ye winds, his story!

And you, ye waters, roll,

Till, like a sea of glory,

It spreads from pole to pole."

[Psa 96:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#012.md)

"Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein." Let the cultivated
plains praise the. Lord. Peace enables their owners to plough and sow
and reap, without fear of the rapine of invaders, and therefore in glad
notes they applaud him whose empire is peace. Both men, and creatures
that graze the plain, and the crops themselves are represented as
swelling the praises of Jehovah, and the figure is both bold and
warranted, for the day shall come when every inhabited rood of ground
shall yield its song, and every farmstead shall contain a church. "Then
shall all the trees of the wood rejoice." He does not say let them
rejoice, but they shall do so. The faith of the Psalmist turns itself
from the expression of desire to the fully assured prediction of the
event. Groves have in old times stood shuddering at the horrid orgies
which have been performed within their shade, the time shall come when
they shall sing for joy because of the holy worship, the sounds of which
they shall hear. The bush is the stronghold of savage men and robbers,
but it shall be sanctified to retirement and devotion. Perhaps the
Psalmist was thinking of the birds; so Keble must have supposed, for he
versifies the passage thus -

"Field exults and meadow fair,

With each bud and blossom there,

In the lonely woodlands now

Chants aloud each rustling bough."

[Psa 96:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#013.md)

"Before the Lord: for he cometh." Even now he is near, his advent
should, therefore, be the cause of immediate rejoicing already are we in
his presence, let us worship him with delight. "For he cometh to judge
the earth," to rule it with discretion; not to tax it, and control it by
force, as kings often do, but to preside as magistrates do whose
business it is to see justice carried out between man and man. All the
world will be under the jurisdiction of this great Judge, and before his
bar all will be summoned to appear. At this moment he is on the road,
and the hour of his coming draweth nigh. His great assize is proclaimed.
Hear ye not the trumpets? His foot is on the threshold. "He shall judge
the world with righteousness." His essential rectitude will determine
all causes and cases, there will be no bribery and corruption there,
neither can error or failure be found in his decisions. "And the people
with his truth," or rather "the nations in faithfulness." Honesty,
veracity, integrity, will rule upon his judgment-seat. No nation shall
be favoured there, and none be made to suffer through prejudice. The
black man shall be tried by the same law as his white master, the
aboriginal shall have justice executed for him against his civilised
exterminator, the crushed and hunted Bushman shall have space to appeal
against the Boer who slaughtered his tribe, and the South Sea Islander
shall gain attention to his piteous plaint against the treacherous
wretch who kidnapped him from his home. There shall be true judgment
given without fear or favour. In all this let the nations be glad, and
the universe rejoice.

In closing, let us ourselves join in the song. Since the whole universe
is to be clothed with smiles, shall not we be glad? As John Howe
observes, "Shall we not partake in this common dutiful joy, and fall
into concert with the adoring loyal chorus? Will we cut ourselves off
from this gladsome obsequious throng? And what should put a pleasant
face and aspect upon the whole world, shall it only leave our faces
covered with clouds and a mournful sadness?"
