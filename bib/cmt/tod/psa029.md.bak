### [Psalms Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 29:0</span></span>

Title - A Psalm of David. The title affords us no information beyond the
fact that David is the author of this sublime song.

Subject - It seems to be the general opinion of modern annotators, that
this Psalm is meant to express the glory of God as heard in the pealing
thunder, and seen in an equinoctial tornado. Just as the[Psa
8:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#001.md) is to be read by moonlight, when
the stars are bright, as the nineteenth needs the rays of the rising sun
to bring out its beauty, so this can be best rehearsed beneath the black
wing of tempest, by the glare of the lightning, or amid that dubious
dusk which heralds the war of elements. The verses march to the tune of
thunderbolts. God is everywhere conspicuous, and all the earth is hushed
by the majesty of his presence. The word of God in the law and gospel is
here also depicted in its majesty of power. True ministers are sons of
thunder, and the voice of God in Christ Jesus is full of majesty. Thus
we have God's works and God's word joined together: let no man put them
asunder by a false idea that theology and science can by any possibility
oppose each other. We may, perhaps, by a prophetic glance, behold in
this Psalm the dread tempests of the latter days, and the security of
the elect people.

Division - The first two verses are a call to adoration. From [Psa
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#003.md) to [Psa
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#010.md) the path of the tempest is
traced, the attributes of God's word are rehearsed, and God magnified in
all the terrible grandeur of his power; and the last verse sweetly
closes the scene with the assurance that the omnipotent Jehovah will
give both strength and peace to his people. Let heaven and earth pass
away, the Lord will surely bless his people.

Hints to Preachers

[Psa 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001.md) - The duty of ascribing our
strength and the honour of it to God; the penalty of neglecting to do
so; the pleasure of so doing.

[Psa 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001.md) - National glorying should
be in the Lord.

[Psa 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#002) (first clause.md) - Royal dues,
the royal treasury, loyal subjects paying their dues, the king receiving
them. Smugglers and preventive men.

[Psa 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#002) (second clause.md) - Inspired

of holiness." Absence of all allusions to place, time, order words,
form, vestments, etc.

[Psa 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#003.md) - God's voice heard in
trouble and above trouble, or in great personal and national calamities.

[Psa 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#004.md) - Power and majesty of the
gospel. Illustrated by succeeding verses.

[Psa 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#004) (last clause.md) - "The
majestic voice." See "Spurgeon's Sermons," No. 87.

[Psa 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#005.md) - The breaking power of the
gospel.

[Psa 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#006.md) - The unsettling power of
the gospel.

[Psa 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#007.md) - The fire which goes with
the word. This is a wide subject.

[Psa 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#008.md) - The arousing and alarming
of godless places by the preaching of the word.

[Psa 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#009.md) - The revealing power of the
word of God in the secrets of man's heart, and its regenerating force.

[Psa 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#009) (last clause.md)

I. Matchless temple.

II\. Unanimous worship.

III\. Forcible motive.

IV\. General enthusiasm, "glory." See Comment.

[Psa 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#010.md) - The ever-present and
undisturbed government of God.

[Psa 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#011.md) - The twin blessings from
the same source; their connection, and their consummation.

[Psa 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#011.md) - The two wills, the two
blessings, the one people, the one Lord.

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Whole Psalm

In this Psalm, the strength of Jehovah is celebrated; and the
exemplification of it is evidently taken from a thunder storm in
Lebanon. The Psalm seems to be addressed to the angels. See [Psa
89:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#007.md). It thus begins: -

"Render unto Jehovah, ye sons of the mighty,

Render unto Jehovah glory and strength;

Render to Jehovah the glory of his name;

Bow down to Jehovah in the majesty of holiness!"

Immediately follows the description of the thunder storm, in which it
does not seem fanciful to observe the historical progression which is
usual on such occasions. The first lines seem to describe only the noise
of the thunder, the description growing more intense as the rumbling
draws nearer.

"The voice of Jehovah is above the waters;

The God of glory thundereth

Jehovah is louder than many waters,

The voice of Jehovah in strength,

The voice of Jehovah in majesty!"

But now the effects become visible; the storm has descended on the
mountains and forests: -

"The voice of Jehovah shivers the cedars,

Even shivers Jehovah the cedars of Lebanon;

And makes them to skip, like a calf;

Lebanon and Sirion, like a young buffalo,

The voice of Jehovah forketh the lightning's flash!"

From the mountains the storm sweeps down into the plains, where,
however, its effects are not so fearful as on the mountains -

"The voice of Jehovah causeth the desert to tremble -

The voice of Jehovah causeth to tremble the desert of Kadesh -

The voice of Jehovah causeth the oaks to tremble,

And lays bare the forests!

Therefore, in his temple every one speaks of his glory."

The description of the swollen torrents closes the scene -

"Jehovah upon the rain-torrent sitteth.

Yea, sitteth Jehovah a king for ever."

And the moral or application of the whole is -

"Jehovah to his people will give strength.

Jehovah will bless his people with peace."

Robert Murray M'Cheyne, 1813 - 1843.

Whole Psalm

There is no phenomenon in nature so awful as a thunder storm, and almost
every poet from Homer and Virgil down to Dante and Milton, or rather
down to Grahame and Pollok, has described it. In the Bible, too, we have
a thunder storm, the [Psa 29:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001.md) -
the description of a tempest, which, rising from the Mediterranean, and
travelling by Lebanon and along the inland mountains, reaches Jerusalem,
and sends the people into the temple-porticoes for refuge; and, besides
those touches of terror in which the geographical progress of the
tornado is described, it derives a sacred vitality and power from the
presence of Jehovah in each successive peal. - James Hamilton, D.D., in
"The Literary Attractions of the Bible," 1849.

Whole Psalm

A glorious Psalm of praise sung during a tempest, the majesty of which
shakes universal nature, so much so that the greatness of the power of
the Lord is felt by all in heaven and on earth. This Lord is the God of
his people, who blesses them with strength and peace. To rightly
appreciate the feelings of the bard, one ought to realise an Oriental
storm, especially in the mountainous regions of Palestine, which,
accompanied by the terrific echoes of the encircling mountains, by
torrents of rain-like waterspouts, often scatters terror on mankind,
beast, destruction on cities and fields. Wilson, the traveller,
describes such a tempest in the neighbourhood of Baalbek: "I was
overtaken by a storm, as if the floodgates of heaven had burst; it came
on in a moment, and raged with a power which suggested the end of the
world. Solemn darkness covered the earth: the rain descended in
torrents, and sweeping down the mountain side, became by the fearful
power of the storm transmuted into thick clouds of fog." Compare also
our Lord's parable, taken from life, in [Mat
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#027.md). - Augustus F. Tholuck, in loc.

[Psa 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001.md)

"Give unto the Lord." Give, give, give. This showeth how unwilling such
are usually to give God his right, or to suffer a word of exhortation to
this purpose. - John Trapp.

[Psa 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001.md)

"O ye mighty." The Septuagint renders it, O ye sons of rams! These
bell-wethers should not cast their noses into the air, and carry their
crest the higher, because the shepherd hath bestowed a bell upon them,
more than upon the rest of the flock. - John Trapp.

[Psa 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001.md), [Psa
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#002.md)

There are three gives in these two verses. - "Give unto the Lord, give
unto the Lord, give unto the Lord the glory that is due unto his name."
Glory is God's right, and he stands upon his right; and this the sincere
Christian knows, and therefore he gives him his right, he gives him the
honour and the glory that is due unto his name. But pray do not mistake
me. I do not say that such as are really sincere do actually eye the
glory of Christ in all their actions. Oh, no! This is a happiness
desirable on earth, but shall never be attained till we come to heaven.
Bye and base ends and aims will be still ready to creep into the best
hearts, but all sincere hearts sigh and groan under them. They complain
to God of them, and they cry out for justice, justice upon them; and it
is the earnest desire and daily endeavours of their souls to be rid of
them; and therefore they shall not be imputed to them, nor keep good
things from them. But now take a sincere Christian in his ordinary,
usual, and habitual course, and you shall find that his aims and ends in
all his actions and undertakings are to glorify God, to exalt God, and
to lift up God in the world. If the hypocrite did in good earnest aim at
the glory of God in what he does, then the glory of God would swallow up
his bye-aims and carnal ends, as Aaron's rod swallowed up the magicians'
rods. [Exo 7:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#010.md). Look, as the sun
puts out the light of the fire, so the glory of God, where it is aimed
at, will put out and consume all bye and base ends. This is most
certain, that which is a man's great end, that will work out all other
ends. He that sets up the glory of God as his chief end, will find that
his chief end will by degrees eat out all low and base ends. Look, as
Pharaoh's lean kine ate up the fat ([Gen
41:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#004).md), so the glory of God will eat up
all those fat and worldly ends that crowd in upon the soul in religious
work. Where the glory of God is kept up as a man's greatest end, there
all bye and base ends will be kept at an under. - Thomas Brooks.

[Psa 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#002.md)

"Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name." Which yet you cannot
do, for his name is above all praise ([Psa
148:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#013).md); but you must aim at it. The
Rabbins observe that God's holy name is mentioned eighteen several times
in this Psalm; that great men especially may give him the honour of his
name, that they may stand in awe and not sin, that they may bring
presents to him who ought to be feared, and those also the very best of
the best, since he is a great king, and standeth much upon his
seniority. [Mal 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#014.md). - John Trapp.

[Psa 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#002.md)

"Worship the Lord." If any should ask, Why is the Lord to be worshipped?
Why must he have such high honours from those that are high? What doth
he in the world that calls for such adoration? David answereth
meteorologically as well as theologically, he answers from the clouds
([Psa 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#003.md), [Psa
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#004).md), "The voice of the Lord is upon
the waters: the God of glory thundereth: the Lord is upon many waters.
The voice of the Lord is powerful; the voice of the Lord is full of
majesty;" as if he had said, Although the Lord Jesus Christ will not set
up an outward, pompous, political kingdom, such as that of Cyrus,
Alexander, etc., yet by the ministry of the gospel he will erect a
spiritual kingdom, and gather to himself a church that shall abide for
ever, out of all the nations of the earth; for the gospel shall be
carried and preached, to not only the people of Israel, the Jews, but to
the Gentiles, all the world over, that the minds of men may be
enlightened, awakened, and moved with that unheard of doctrine of
salvation by Christ, which had been hid from ages and generations. -
Joseph Caryl

[Psa 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#003.md)

"The voice of the Lord is upon the waters: the God of glory thundereth;
the Lord is upon many waters." Yes, great God, these torrents of tears
which flow down from my eyes announce thy divine presence in my soul.
This heart hitherto so dry, so arid, so hard; this rock which thou hast
struck a second time, will not resist thee any longer, for out of it
there now gushes healthful waters in abundance. The selfsame voice of
God which overturns the mountains, thunders, lightens, and divides the
heaven above the sinner, now commands the clouds to pour forth showers
of blessings, changing the desert of his soul into a field producing a
hundredfold; that voice I hear. - J. B. Massillon.

[Psa 29:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#003.md)

"The Lord," etc. All things which we commonly say are the effects of the
natural powers of matter and laws of motion, are, indeed (if we will
speak strictly and properly), the effects of God's acting upon matter
continually and at every moment, either immediately by himself, or
mediately by some created intelligent being. Consequently there is no
such thing as the cause of nature, or the power of nature. - Samuel
Clarke, 1675-1729.

[Psa 29:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#003.md)

The voice of the Lord on the ocean is known,

The God of eternity thundereth abroad;

The voice of the Lord from the depth of his throne

Is terror and power; - all nature is awed.

The voice of the Lord through the calm of the wood

Awakens its echoes, strikes light through its caves.

The Lord sitteth King on the turbulent flood,

The winds are his servants, his servants the waves.

James Montgomery, 1771-1854.

[Psa 29:3-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#003.md)

Messiah's voice is in the cloud,

The God of glory thunders loud.

Messiah rides along the floods,

He treads upon the flying clouds.

Messiah's voice is full of power,

His lightnings play when tempests lower.

Messiah's voice the cedars breaks,

While Lebanon's foundation quakes.

Messiah's voice removes the hills,

And all the plains with rivers fills.

The voice of their expiring God,

Shall make the rocks to start abroad;

Mount Zion and Mount Sirion,

Shall bound along with Lebanon:

The flames of fire shall round him wreathe,

When he shall on the ether breathe.

Messiah's voice shall shake the earth,

And, lo! the graves shall groan in birth,

Ten thousand thousand living sons

Shall be the issue of their groans.

The peace of God, the gospel sounds;

The peace of God, the earth rebounds;

The gospel everlasting shines

A light from God that ne'er declines.

This is the light Jehovah sends,

To bless the world's remotest ends.

Barclay's Paraphrase.

[Psa 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#004.md)

"The voice of the Lord." These vehement repetitions resemble a series of
thunder-claps; one seems to hear the dread artillery of heaven firing
volley after volley, while peal on peal the echo follows the sound. - C.
H. S.

[Psa 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#004.md)

"The voice of the Lord is powerful." I would render unto God the glory
due unto his name, for the admirable change which he has wrought in my
heart. There was nothing to be found in me but an impious hardness and
inveterate disorder. From this helpless state he changed me into a new
man and made resplendent the glory of his name and the power of his
grace. He alone can work such prodigies. Unbelievers who refuse to
acknowledge the hand of God in creation must surely in this case admit,
that "this is the finger of God." Yes, great God, chaos knows not how to
resist thee, it hears thy voice obediently, but the obdurate heart
repels thee, and thy mighty voice too often calls to it in vain. Thou
art not so great and wonderful in creating worlds out of nothing as thou
art when thou dost command a rebel heart to arise from its abyss of sin,
and to run in the ways of thy commandments. To disperse a chaos of crime
and ignorance by the majesty of thy word, to shed light on the direst
darkness, and by the Holy Ghost to establish harmonious order where all
was confusion, manifests in far greater measure thine omnipotence than
the calling forth of heavenly laws and celestial suns from the first
chaos. - J. B. Massilion.

[Psa 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#004.md)

O may the evangelical "Boanerges" so cause the glorious sound of the
gospel to be heard under the whole heaven, that the world may again be
made sensible thereof; before that voice of the Son of Man, which hath
so often called sinners to repentance, shall call them to judgment. -
George Horne.

[Psa 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#004.md)

Where the word of a king is, there is power, but what imperial voice
shall be likened unto the majestic thunder of the Lord? - C. H. S.

[Psa 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#005.md)

"The voice of Jehovah." Philosophers think not that they have reasoned
skilfully enough about inferior causes, unless they separate God very
far from his works. It is a diabolical science, however, which fixes our
contemplations on the works of nature, and turns them away from God. If
any one who wished to know a man, should take no notice of his face, but
should fix his eyes only on the points of his nails, his folly might
justly be derided. But far greater is the folly of those philosophers,
who, out of mediate and proximate causes, weave themselves vails lest
they should be compelled to acknowledge the hand of God, which
manifestly displays itself in his works. - John Calvin.

[Psa 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#005.md)

"The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars," etc. Like as tempests when
they arise, and lightning, quickly and in a trice, hurl down and
overturn mountains and the highest trees; even so doth the Lord bring
down with a breakneck fall, the proud, haughty, arrogant, and insolent,
who set themselves against God, and seek the spoil of those that be
quiet and godly. - Robert Cawdray.

[Psa 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#005.md)

"The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars." The ancient expositors
remind us that the breaking of the cedar trees by the wind, is a figure
of the laying low of the lofty and proud things of this world, by the
rushing mighty wind of the Holy Spirit, given on that day. Confringit
cedros Deus, hoc est humiliat superbos. (S. Jerome, and so S. Basil.) -
Christopher Wordsworth.

[Psa 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#005.md)

"The Lord breaketh the cedars of Lebanon." - What a shame is it then
that our hard hearts break not, yield not, though thunder-struck with
the dreadful menaces o1 God's mouth! - John Trapp.

[Psa 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#005.md)

"Breaketh the cedars of Lebanon." -

When high in air the pine ascends,

To every ruder blast it bends.

The palace falls with heavier weight,

When tumbling from its airy height;

And when from heaven the lightning flies.

It blasts the hills that proudest rise.

Horace, translated by Philip Francis, D.D., 1765.

[Psa 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#005.md)

"The cedars of Lebanon." These mighty trees of God, which for ages have
stood the force of the tempest, rearing their evergreen colossal boughs
in the region of everlasting snow, are the first objects of the fury of
the lightning, which is well known to visit first the highest objects. -
Robert Murray M'Cheyne.

[Psa 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#006.md)

"He maketh them also to skip like a call; Lebanon and Sirion like a
young unicorn;" that is, the Lord by his thundering, powerful voice,
first, will make them skip, as frighted with fear; and secondly, as
revived with joy. Yet more ([Psa
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#007).md), "The voice of the Lord divideth
the flames of fire;" that is, will send and divide to every one as they
need ([Co1 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#011).md), the Holy Spirit,
who is compared to and called fire ([Mat
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011).md), and who came as with a thunder
storm of a rushing mighty wind, and with the appearance of cloven
tongues, like as of fire, and sat upon each one of the apostles. [Act
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#002.md), [Act
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#003.md). Nor did this voice of thunder,
accompanied with divided flames of fire reach Jerusalem only; for, as it
follows ([Psa 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#008).md), "The voice of the
Lord shaketh the wilderness; the Lord shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh;"
that is, the Lord by the voice of the gospel shall go forth with power
to those Gentiles, who are like a wilderness, barren of goodness, and
unmanured in spirituals, though they dwell in well-governed cities, and
are well furnished with morals. It shall go forth also to those Gentiles
who inhabit waste wildernesses, and are not so much as reduced to
civility. These wildernesses, the thundering voice of the Lord hath
shaken heretofore, and doth shake at this day, and will yet further
shake, that the fulness of the Gentiles may come in. Many of these
wildernesses hath the Lord turned into fruitful fields, and pleasant
lands, by the voice of the gospel sounding among them. For in these
wildernesses (as it followeth, [Psa
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#009).md), "The voice of the Lord maketh
the hinds to calve;" that is, they that were as wild, as untaught, and
untamed as the hind, or any beast in the forest, he brings to the
sorrows of their new birth, to repentance and gospel humiliation, and in
doing this, "he (as the Psalmist goes on), discovereth the forests;"
that is, opens the hearts of men, which are as thick set and full grown
with vanity, pride, hypocrisy, self-love, and self-sufficiency, as also
with wantonness and sensuality, as any forest is overgrown with thickets
of trees and bushes, which deny all passage through, till cleared away
with burning down or cutting up. Such an opening, such a discovery, doth
the Lord make in the forests of men's hearts, by the sword and fire,
that is, by the word and spirit of the gospel; and when all this is
done, the forest becomes a temple, and as that verse concludes, "In his
temple doth every one speak of his glory." And if the floods of
ungodliness rise up against this people, whom the thunder and lightning
of the gospel have subdued to Christ, and framed into a holy temple,
then the Psalmist assureth us ([Psa
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#010).md), "The Lord sitteth upon the
flood," that is, 'tis under his power, he ruleth and overruleth it;
"Yea, the Lord sitteth King for ever;" and ([Psa
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#011).md), "The Lord will give strength
unto his people; the Lord will bless his people with peace." Thus, the
Lord "thundereth marvellously" ([Job
37:5](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#005).md), and these are glorious marvels
which he thundereth; he converts sinners.

Thus, though I like not their way who are given to allegorise the
Scriptures, yet I doubt not but we may make a profitable use of this and
many other Scriptures by way of allegory. This being an undeniable
truth, which is the ground of it - that the Lord puts forth, as it were,
the power of thunder and lightning in the preaching of his Word; these
two things are to be marked. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#006.md)

"He maketh them also to skip like a calf." That is to say, he hath made
the splinters and broken pieces of trees that have been struck with
lightning, to fly up into the air, or when they have been shaken by the
wind, storms, or by earthquakes. - John Diodati.

[Psa 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#006.md)

The original is -

"And makes them skip like a calf,

Lebanon and Sirion, like a young buffalo."

At first sight it might appear that the cedars were still meant, and
that Lebanon and Sirion were used by metonymy for the cedars which grew
upon them. But, 1. We never hear of cedars growing upon Sirion, or
Shenit, or Hermon, for it has all these names; and, 2. There is a
parallel passage where this interpretation will hardly answer in [Psa
114:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#001.md) Describing the exodus of
Israel, it says -

"The mountains skipped like rams,

And the little hills like lambs."

The same verb occurs here, the verb which means "to skip, to dance,"
used in [Nah 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#002.md), to signify the
jolting of chariots, and also in [Joe
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#005.md). In both these instances, rough
motion, accompanied with noise, seems intended. Now, though this may
very well be understood as a highly figurative description, as it
undoubtedly is, of the usual effects of a thunder storm; yet it is
interesting to compare it with the following passage of Volney, which
describes certain phenomena as frequent in Mount Lebanon, which may give
a new meaning to the "skipping of the mountains:" -

"When the traveller," says he, "penetrates the interior of these
mountains, the ruggedness of the roads, the steepness of the
declivities, the depth of the precipices, have at first a terrific
effect; but the sagacity of the mules which bear him soon inspires him
with confidence, and enables him to examine at his ease the picturesque
scenes which succeed one another, so as almost to bewilder him. There,
as in the Alps, he sometimes travels whole days to arrive at a spot
which was in sight when he set out. He turns, he descends, he winds
round, he climbs; and under the perpetual change of position, one is
ready to think that a magical power is varying at every step the
beauties of the landscapes. Sometimes villages are seen, ready as it
were to slide down the deep declivities, and so disposed that the roofs
of the one row of houses serve as a street to the row above. At another
time, you see a convent seated on an isolated cone, like Marshaia in the
valley of Tigr. Here a rock is pierced by a torrent, forming a natural
cascade as at Nahr-el-Leban; there another rock assumes the appearance
of a natural wall! Often on the sides, ledges of stones, washed down and
left by the waters, resemble ruins disposed by art. In some places, the
waters meeting with inclined beds, have undermined the intermediate
earth, and have formed caverns, as at Nahr-el-Kelb, near Antoura. In
other places, they have worn for themselves subterranean channels,
through which flow little rivulets during part of the year, as at Mar
Hama. Sometimes these picturesque circumstances have become tragical
ones. Rocks loosened or thrown off their equilibrium by thaw or
earthquake, have been known to precipitate themselves on the adjacent
dwellings, and crush the inhabitants. An accident of this kind, about
twenty years ago, buried a whole village near Mar Djordos, so as to
leave no trace of its existence. More recently, and near the same spot,
the soil of a hill planted with mulberry trees and vines detached itself
by a sudden thaw, and, sliding over the surface of the rock which it had
covered, like a vessel launched from the stocks, established itself
entire in the valley below." - Robert Murray M'Cheyne.

[Psa 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#007.md)

"The voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire." By the power of
God, the "flames of fire" are "divided" and sent abroad from the clouds
upon the earth, in the terrible form of lightning, that sharp and
glittering sword of the Almighty, which no substance can withstand. The
same power of God goeth forth by his word, "quick and powerful, and
sharper than any two-edged sword," penetrating, melting, enlightening,
and inflaming the hearts of men. [Act
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#003.md), [Heb
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012.md). - George Horne.

[Psa 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#007.md)

"The voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire." The voice of the
Lord is here said to divide the flames; literally, to hew out flames,
λατομεῖν φλόγας. The Sept has διακόπτει φλόγα πυρός. In the words of
Gesenius, "The voice of Jehovah cutteth out flames of fire," i.e.,
"sendeth out divided flames of fire." This is (as Theodoret has
observed) very descriptive of the divine action at Pentecost, sending
forth divided flames, like "tela trisulca," in the tongues of fire which
were divided off from one heavenly source or fountain of flame, and sat
upon the heads of the apostles, and which filled them with the fire of
holy zeal and love. - Christopher Wordsworth.

[Psa 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#007.md)

"Divideth the flames of fire." Marg., cutteth out. The Hebrew word חצך
khatzab means properly to cut, to hew, to hew out; as for example,
stones. The allusion here is undoubtedly to lightning; and the image is
either that it seems to be cut out, or cut into tongues and streaks -
or, more probably, that the clouds seem to be cut or hewed, so as to
make openings or paths for the lightning. The eye is evidently fixed on
the clouds, and on the sudden flash of lightning, as if the clouds had
been cleaved or opened for the passage of it. The idea of the Psalmist
is, that the "voice of the Lord," or the thunder, seems to cleave or
open the clouds for the flames of fire to play amidst the tempest. -
Albert Barnes.

[Psa 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#008.md)

"The Lord shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh." That Kadesh-Naphtali is
meant, the geographical position of Lebanon would make us believe,
though this is not necessary. And, although Syria is much exposed to
earthquakes - as, for example, that of Aleppo, in 1822, which was
sensibly felt at Damascus - yet it does not seem necessary to imagine
anything farther than the usual effects of a thunder storm. The oaks and
forests of [Psa 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#009.md), suit well with
the description given of the lower limbs of Lebanon, which abound in
"thickets of myrtle, woods of fir, walnut trees, carob trees, and
Turkish oaks." And the rain-torrent of [Psa
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#010.md) is admirably descriptive of the
sudden swell of the thousand streams which flow from Lebanon. According
to modern travellers, the number of water-courses descending from
Lebanon is immense; and the suddenness of the rise of these streams may
be gathered from the contradictions in their accounts. The Nahr-el-Sazib
is described by one as "a rivulet, though crossed by a bridge of six
arches;" by another it is called "a large river." The Damour (the
ancient Tamyras), which flows immediately from Lebanon, is "a river,"
says Mandrell, "apt to swell much upon sudden rains; in which case,
precipitating itself from the mountains with great rapidity, it has been
fatal to many a passenger." He mentions a French gentleman, M. Sport,
who, a few years before, in attempting to ford it, was hurried down by
the stream, and perished in the sea. This is one instance of very many
in the mountains of Lebanon, where the brook, which is usually nearly
dry, becomes all at once an impassable torrent. When Volney looked upon
the rivers of Syria in summer, he doubted whether they could be called
rivers. But had he ventured to cross them after a thunder storm, his
scepticism would no longer have had room or time to exercise itself, and
he would have felt the propriety of the Psalmist's painting, where he
says -

"Jehovah sitteth on the rain-torrents,

Jehovah sitteth a King for ever."

Robert Murray M' Cheyne.

[Psa 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#008.md)

"The voice of the Lord shaketh the wilderness." Great God, I have
laboured to escape thee! I sought refuge for my remorse in a retreat
where nothing might recall me to my God. Far away from the succour, of
religion, remote from all the channels which bring to me the waters of
grace, apart from all whose reproving witness might restrain me from
iniquity; yet even there, Great God, where I believed that I had found
an asylum inaccessible to thine eternal mercy, wherein I could sin with
impunity, even there, in that wilderness, thy voice arrested me and laid
me at thy feet. - J. B. Massillon.

[Psa 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#009.md)

"The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to calve." With respect to the
sense conveyed by the common reading, it may be observed, that hinds
bring forth their young with great difficulty and pain, "bowing
themselves, bruising their young ones, and casting out their sorrows"
([Job 39:4](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#004.md), [Job
39:6](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#006).md); and it therefore heightens the
description given of the terrific character of the thunder storm, when
the thunder which is here called "the voice of God" is represented as
causing, through the terror which it inspires, the hinds in their
pregnant state prematurely to drop their young; although, according to
our ideas of poetical imagery, this may not accord so well with the
other images in the passage, nor appear so beautiful and sublime as the
image of the oaks trembling at the voice of Jehovah. - John Calvin.

[Psa 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#009.md)

"The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to calve." The care and
tenderness of God towards beasts turns to his praise, as well as the
care which he hath of, and the tenderness which he shows to believers.
As it doth exceedingly advance the glory of God, that he takes care of
wild beasts, so it may exceedingly strengthen the faith of man that he
will take care of him. Doth the Lord take care of hinds? then certainly
he takes care of those that particularly belong to him. There is a
special providence of God towards these and such like creatures for the
production of their young. He - if I may so speak with reverence - shows
his midwifery in helping these savage beasts when their pains come upon
them. As the Lord takes man, in an eminent manner, "out of the womb"
([Psa 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#009).md), so in a manner he takes
beasts out of the womb too. "The voice of the Lord shaketh the
wilderness; the Lord shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh;" so we translate
it; but the word which we render "shaketh" is the same with that in [Job
39:2](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#002.md), which signifieth to bring forth;
and hence, some very learned in the Hebrew tongue do not render as we,
"The voice of the Lord shaketh the wilderness," but "The voice of the
Lord maketh the wilderness to bring forth; the Lord maketh the
wilderness of Kadesh to bring forth;" which is not to be understood of
the vegetative creatures (that's a truth, the Lord makes the trees of
the forest to bring forth both leaves and fruit), but it is meant of
animals or living creatures there. And then when he saith, "The voice of
the Lord maketh the wilderness to bring forth," the meaning is, the Lord
makes the wild beast of the wilderness to bring forth; which seems to be
the clear sense of the place by that which followeth; for the Psalmist
having said this in general at the [Psa
29:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#008.md), "The voice of the Lord maketh
the wilderness to bring forth," he in the [Psa
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#009.md)gives the special instance of the
hind: "The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to calve." - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#009.md)

"The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to calve." It is with great
propriety, say one of the ancients, that Jehovah demands, "The birth of
the hinds dost thou guard?" ([Job
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#001).md), for since this animal is always
in flight, and with fear and terror always leaping and skipping about,
she could never bring her young to maturity without such a special
protection. The providence of God, therefore, is equally conspicuous in
the preservation of the mother and the fawn; both are the objects of his
compassion and tender care; and, consequently, that afflicted man has no
reason to charge his Maker with unkindness, who condescends to watch
over the goats and the hinds. It seems to be generally admitted, that
the hind brings forth her young with great difficulty; and so much
appears to be suggested in the verse, "They bow themselves, they bring
forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows." But if Pliny, and
other naturalists are worthy of credit, divine providence has been
graciously pleased to provide certain herbs, which greatly facilitate
the birth; and by instinct, he directs the hind to feed upon them, when
the time of gestation draws towards a close. Whatever truth there may be
in this assertion, we know from higher authority, that providence
promotes the parturition of the hind, by awakening her fears, and
agitating her frame by the rolling thunder: - "The voice of Jehovah (a
common Hebrew phrase, denoting thunder) maketh the hinds to calve." Nor
ought we to wonder, that so timorous a creature as the hind, should be
so much affected by that awful atmospheric convulsion, when some of the
proudest men that ever existed, have been known to tremble. Augustus,
the Roman Emperor, according to Suetonius, was so terrified when it
thundered, that he wrapped a seal-skin round his body, with the view of
defending it from the lightning, and concealed himself in some secret
corner till the tempest ceased. The tyrant Caligula, who sometimes
affected to threaten Jupiter himself, covered his head, or hid himself
under a bed; and Horace confesses he was reclaimed from atheism by the
terror of thunder and lightning, the effects of which he describes with
his usual felicity. (Odes, b. 1:34.) - George Paxton's "Illustrations of
Scripture."

[Psa 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#009.md)

"The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to calve." "Cervi sunt
predicatores," says S. Jerome, who bring forth souls to Christ by the
gospel which is God's voice; and the stripping of the leaves of the
forest by the voice of the Lord, represents their work in humbling the
strong oaks and lofty cedars of the world by the power of the gospel,
and in stripping the souls of the worldly-minded of their manifold
disguises (S. Basil). Others apply it to the act of the preachers of
God's word, disclosing the dark thickets of divine mysteries in the holy
Scriptures by evangelical light set forth by the Holy Ghost (S. Jerome).
- Christopher Wordsworth.

[Psa 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#009) (first clause.md)

"The voice of Jehovah makes havoc of the oaks, and strippeth bare the
forests." - Samuel Horsley.

[Psa 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#009.md)

"In his temple." - Some conceive that this Psalm was appointed by David
to be sung in the temple in time of thunder, which is not unlikely.
There are writers who make God to be the nominative case to the verb
speaketh; and render it thus, in his temple doth he utter all his glory.
As much as to say, much of his glory God uttereth in his thunder, but
all in his temple, for whatsoever there he speaketh with his mouth he
fulfilleth it with his hand. - John Trapp.

[Psa 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#009) (last clause.md)

David speaking in the former part of the Psalm of the effects of natural
thunder only, towards the close of the Psalm applieth it to the Word of
God, while he saith, "And in his temple cloth every one speak of his
glory;" that is, the word and ordinances of God, ministered in his
church or temple, will put every one to acknowledge and speak of the
glorious power of God, even much more than the mighty thunder which
soundeth in our ears, or the subtle lightning which flasheth in our
eyes. There is far more royal power in the thunder of the Word, than in
the word of thunder. This terrifieth only to conviction, but that
terrifieth to salvation; for after God speaks terror there in his
threatenings, he speaks comfort in the promises; and when he hath
affrighted us with a sense of our sins and of his wrath due to us for
our sins, as with an horrible tempest, he presently refresheth us with
the gentle gales of revealed grace, and with the pleasant amiable
sunshine of his favour by Jesus Christ. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#011.md)

"The Lord will give strength unto his people; the Lord will bless his
people with peace;" i.e., he is in war their strength, and their
felicity in peace; In war he is the Author of all that power wherewith
they are enabled to oppose and overcome potent enemies; and in peace, he
is their truly felicitating good, and makes them by his own vouchsafed
presence, a truly blessed people. - John Howe.

[Psa 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#011.md)

"The Lord will bless his people with peace." Though some precious souls
that have closed with Christ, and embraced the gospel, be not at present
brought to rest in their own consciences, but continue for awhile under
some dissatisfaction and trouble in their own spirits, yet even then
they have peace of conscience in a threefold respect; in pretio, in
promisso, in semine. First, every true believer hath peace of conscience
in pretio; the gospel puts that price into his hand, which will
assuredly purchase it, and that is the blood of Christ. We say that is
gold which is worth gold, which we may anywhere exchange for gold; such
is the blood of Christ; it is peace of conscience, because the soul that
hath this may exchange it for this. God himself cannot deny the poor
creature that prays on these terms: Lord, give me peace of conscience;
here is Christ's blood, the price of it. That which could pay the debt,
surely can procure the receipt. Peace of conscience is but a discharge
under God's hand, that the debt due to divine justice is fully paid. The
blood of Christ hath done that the greater for the believer, it shall
therefore do this the less. If there were such a rare potion that did
infallibly procure health to every one that takes it, we might safely
say, as soon as the sick man hath drunk it down, that he hath drunk his
health, it is in him, though at present he doth not feel himself to have
it' in time it will appear. Secondly, in promisso. Every true believer
hath peace of conscience in the promise, and that we count as good as
ready money in the purse, which we have sure bond for. "The Lord will
bless his people with peace." He is resolved on it, and then who shall
hinder it? It is worth your reading the whole Psalm, to see what weight
the Lord gives to this sweet promise, for the encouragement of our faith
in expecting the performance thereof. Nothing more hard to enter into
the heart of a poor creature (when all is in an uproar in his bosom, and
his conscience threatening nothing but fire and sword, wrath, vengeance,
from God for his sins), than thoughts or hopes of peace and comfort. Now
the Psalm is spent in showing what great things God can do, and that
with no more trouble to himself than a word speaking, "The voice of the
Lord is full of majesty" ([Psa 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#004).md),
"It breaks the cedars, it divides the flames, it shakes the wilderness,
it makes the hinds to calve." This God that doth all this, promiseth to
bless his people with peace, outward and inward; for without this inward
peace, though he might give them peace, yet could he never bless them
with peace as he there undertakes. A sad peace, were it not, to have
quiet streets, but cutting of throats in our houses? yet infinitely more
sad to have peace both in our streets and houses, but war and blood in
our guilty consciences. What peace can a poor creature taste or relish,
while the sword of God's wrath lies at the throat of conscience? not
peace with God himself. Therefore Christ purchased peace of pardon, to
obtain peace of conscience for his pardoned ones, and accordingly hath
bequeathed it in the promise to them, "Peace I leave with you, my peace
I give unto you." [Joh 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#027.md). Where
you see he is both the testator to leave, and the executor of his own
will, to give out with his own hands what his love hath left believers;
so that there is no fear but his will shall be performed to the full,
seeing himself lives to see it done. Thirdly, in semine. Every believer
hath this inward peace in the seed. "Light is sown for the righteous,
and gladness for the upright in heart." [Psa
97:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#011.md). Where sown, but in the
believer's own bosom, when principles of grace and holiness were cast
into it by the Spirit of God? Hence it is called "the peaceable fruit of
righteousness." [Heb 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#011.md). It shoots
as naturally from holiness, as any fruit in its kind doth from the seed
proper to it. It is, indeed, most true, that the seed runs and ripens
into this fruit sooner in some than it doth in others. This spiritual
harvest comes not alike soon to all, no more than the other that is
outward doth; but here is the comfort - whoever hath a seed-time of
grace pass over his soul, shall have his harvest-time also of joy. -
William Gurnall.

[Psa 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#011.md)

"Peace." There is a threefold "peace," externa, interna, aeterna;
temporal, spiritual, celestial peace. There is outward peace, the
blessing; inward peace, the grace; and everlasting peace, of glory. And
as in a stately palace there is a lodge or court that leads into the
inmost goodly rooms, so external peace is the entrance or introduction
to the inward lodgings of the sweet peace of conscience and of that
eternal rest in which our peace in heaven shall be happy, inasmuch as
external peace affords us many accommodations and helps to the gaining
and obtaining both the one and the other. - Ephraim Udall. 1642.

[Psalms 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 29:1</span></span>

1 Give unto the Lord, O ye mighty, give unto the Lord glory and
strength.

2 Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name; worship the Lord in
the beauty of holiness.

[Psa 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001.md)

"Give," i.e., ascribe. Neither men nor angels can confer anything upon
Jehovah, but they should recognise his glory and might, and ascribe it
to him in their songs and in their hearts. "Unto the Lord," and unto him
alone, must honour be given. Natural causes, as men call them, are God
in action, and we must not ascribe power to them, but to the infinite
Invisible who is the true source of all. "O ye mighty." Ye great ones of
earth and of heaven, kings and angels, join in rendering worship to the
blessed and only Potentate; ye lords among men need thus to be reminded,
for ye often fail where humbler men are ardent; but fail no longer, bow
your heads at once, and loyally do homage to the King of kings. How
frequently do grandees and potentates think it beneath them to fear the
Lord; but, when they have been led to extol Jehovah, their piety has
been the greatest jewel in their crowns. "Give unto the Lord glory and
strength," both of which men are too apt to claim for themselves,
although they are the exclusive prerogatives of the self-existent God.
Let crowns and swords acknowledge their dependence upon God. Not to your
arms, O kings, give ye the glory, nor look for strength to your host of
warriors, for all your pomp is but as a fading flower, and your might is
as a shadow which declineth. When shall the day arrive when kings and
princes shall count it their delight to glorify their God? "All worship
be to God only," let this be emblazoned on every coat of arms.

[Psa 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#002.md)

"Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name." A third time the
admonition is given, for men are backward in glorifying God, and
especially great men, who are often too much swollen with their own
glory to spare time to give God his rightful praise, although nothing
more is asked of them than is most just and right. Surely men should not
need so much pressing to give what is due, especially when the payment
is so pleasant. Unbelief and distrust, complaining and murmuring, rob
God of his honour; in this respect, even the saints fail to give due
glory to their King. "Worship the Lord," bow before him with devout
homage and sacred awe, and let your worship be such as he appoints. Of
old, worship was cumbered with ceremonial, and men gathered around one
dedicated building, whose solemn pomp was emblematic of "the beauty of
holiness;" but now our worship is spiritual, and the architecture of the
house and the garments of the worshippers are matters of no importance;
the spiritual beauty of inward purity and outward holiness being far
more precious in the eyes of our thrice holy God. O for grace ever to
worship with holy motives and in a holy manner, as becometh saints! The
call to worship in these two verses chimes in with the loud pealing
thunder, which is the church bell of the universe ringing kings and
angels, and all the sons of earth to their devotions.

[Psalms 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 29:3</span></span>

3 The voice of the Lord is upon the waters: the God of glory thundereth:
the Lord is upon many waters.

4 The voice of the Lord is powerful; the voice of the Lord is full of
majesty.

5 The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars; yea, the Lord breaketh the
cedars of Lebanon.

6 He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a
young unicorn.

7 The voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire

8 The voice of the Lord shaketh the wilderness; the Lord shaketh the
wilderness of Kadesh.

9 The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth the
forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory.

10 The Lord sitteth upon the flood; yea, the Lord sitteth King for ever.

[Psa 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#003.md)

"The voice of the Lord is upon the waters." The thunder is not only
poetically but instructively called "the voice of God," since it peals
from on high; it surpasses all other sounds, it inspires awe, it is
entirely independent of man, and has been used on some occasions as the
grand accompaniment of God's speech to Adam's sons. There is peculiar
terror in a tempest at sea, when deep calleth unto deep, and the raging
sea echoes to the angry sky. No sight more alarming than the flash of
lightning around the mast of the ship; and no sound more calculated to
inspire a reverent awe than the roar of the storm. The children of
heaven have often enjoyed the tumult with humble joy peculiar to the
saints, and even those who know not God have been forced into unwilling
reverence while the storm has lasted. "The God of glory thundereth."
Thunder is in truth no mere electric phenomenon, but is caused by the
interposition of God himself. Even the old heathen spake of Jupiter
Tonans; but our modern wise men will have us believe in laws and forces,
and anything or nothing so that they may be rid of God. Electricity of
itself can do nothing; it must be called and sent upon its errand; and
until the almighty Lord commissions it, its bolt of fire is inert and
powerless. As well might a rock of granite, or a bar of iron fly in the
midst of heaven, as the lightning go without being sent by the great
First Cause. "The Lord is upon many waters." Still the Psalmist's ear
hears no voice but that of Jehovah, resounding from the multitudinous
and dark waters of the upper ocean of clouds, and echoing from the
innumerable billows of the storm-tossed sea below. The waters above and
beneath the firmament are astonished at the eternal voice. When the holy
Spirit makes the divine promise to be heard above the many waters of our
soul's trouble, then is God as glorious in the spiritual world as in the
universe of matter. Above us and beneath us all is the peace of God when
he gives us quiet.

[Psa 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#004.md)

"The voice of the Lord is powerful." An irresistible power attends the
lightning of which the thunder is the report. In an instant, when the
Lord wills it, the force of electricity produces amazing results. A
writer upon this subject, speaks of these results as including a light
of the intensity of the sun in his strength, a heat capable of fusing
the compactest metals, a force in a moment paralysing the muscles of the
most powerful animals; a power suspending the all-pervading gravity of
the earth, and an energy capable of decomposing and recomposing the
closest affinities of the most intimate combinations. Well does Thompson
speak of "the unconquerable lightning," for it is the chief of the ways
at God in physical forces, and none can measure its power.

As the voice of God in nature is so powerful, so is it in grace; the
reader will do well to draw a parallel, and he will find much in the
gospel, which may be illustrated by the thunder of the Lord in the
tempest. His voice, whether in nature or revelation, shakes both earth
and heaven; see that ye refuse not him that speaketh. If his voice be
thus mighty, what must his hand be! beware lest ye provoke a blow. "The
voice of the Lord is powerful; the voice of the Lord is full of
majesty." The King of kings speaks like a king. As when a lion roareth,
all the beasts of the forest are still, so is the earth hushed and mute
while Jehovah thundereth marvellously.

"Tis listening fear and dumb amazement all."

As for the written word of God, its majesty is apparent both in its
style, its matter, and its power over the human mind; blessed be God, it
is the majesty of mercy wielding a silver sceptre; of such majesty the
word of our salvation is full to overflowing.

[Psa 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#005.md)

"The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars."

"Black from the stroke above, the smouldering pine

Stands a sad shatter'd trunk."

Noble trees fall prostrate beneath the mysterious bolt, or stand in
desolation as momentoes of its power. Lebanon itself is not secure, high
as it stands, and ancient as are its venerable woods: "Yea, the Lord
breaketh the cedars of Lebanon." The greatest and most venerable of
trees or men, may not reckon upon immunity when the Lord is abroad in
his wrath. The gospel of Jesus has a like dominion over the most
inaccessible of mortals; and when the Lord sends the word, it breaks
hearts far stouter than the cedars.

[Psa 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#006.md)

"He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a
young unicorn." Not only the trees, but the mountains themselves move as
though they frisked and leaped like young bulls or antelopes. As our own
poets would mention hills and valleys known to them, so the Psalmist
hears the crash and roar among the ranges of Libanus, and depicts the
tumult in graphic terms. Thus sings one of our own countrymen: -

"Amid Carnarvon's mountains rages loud

The repercussive roar with mighty crash

Into the flashing deep, from the rude rocks

Of Penmaen Mawr, heap'd hideous to the sky.

Tumble the smitten cliffs; and Snowdon's peak,

Dissolving, instant yields his wintry load.

Far seen, the heights of heathy Cheviot blaze,

And Thul bellows through her utmost isles."

The glorious gospel of the blessed God has more than equal power over
the rocky obduracy and mountainous pride of man. The voice of our dying
Lord rent the rocks and opened the graves: his living voice still works
the like wonders. Glory be to his name, the hills of our sins leap into
his grave, and are buried in the red sea of his blood, when the voice of
his intercession is heard.

[Psa 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#007.md)

"The voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire." As when sparks fly
from the anvil by blows of a ponderous hammer, so the lightning attends
the thundering strokes of Jehovah.

"At first heard solemn o'er the verge of heaven,

The tempest growls; but as it nearer comes,

And rolls its awful burden on the wind,

The lightnings flash a larger curve, and more

The noise astounds: till overhead a sheet

Of livid flame discloses wide; then shuts

And opens wider; shuts and opens still

Expansive, wrapping ether in a blaze."

The thunder seems to divide one flash from another, interposing its
deepening roar between the flash which precedes it and the next. That
the flashes are truly flames of fire is witnessed by their frequently
falling upon houses, churches, etc., and wrapping them in a blaze. How
easily could the Lord destroy his rebellious creatures with his hot
thunderbolts! how gracious is the hand which spares such great
offenders, when to crush them would be so easy!

Flames of fire attend the voice of God in the gospel, illuminating and
melting the hearts of men; by these he consumes our lusts and kindles in
us a holy flame of ever-inspiring love and holiness. Pentecost is a
suggestive commentary upon this verse.

[Psa 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#008.md)

As the storm travelled, it burst over the desert. "The voice of the Lord
shaketh the wilderness; the Lord shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh." God
courts not the applause of men - his grandest deeds are wrought where
man's inquisitive glance is all unknown. Where no sound of man was
heard, the voice of God was terribly distinct. The vast and silent
plains trembled with affright. Silence did homage to the Almighty voice.
Low lying plains must hear the voice of God as well as lofty mountains;
the poor as well as the mighty must acknowledge the glory of the Lord.
Solitary and barren places are to be gladdened by the gospel's heavenly
sound. What a shaking and overturning power there is in the word of God!
even the conservative desert quivers into progress when God decrees it.

[Psa 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#009.md)

"The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to calve," those timid
creatures, in deadly fear of the tempest, drop their burdens in an
untimely manner. Perhaps a better reading is, "the oaks to tremble,"
especially as this agrees with the next sentence, and "discovereth the
forests." The dense shades of the forest are lit up with the lurid glare
of the lightning, and even the darkest recesses are for a moment laid
bare.

"The gloomy woods

Start at the flash, and from their deep recess

Wide-flaming out, their trembling inmates shake."

Our first parents sought a refuge among the trees, but the voice of the
Lord soon found them out, and made their hearts to tremble. There is no
concealment from the fire-glance of the Almighty - one flash of his
angry eye turns midnight into noon. The gospel has a like revealing
power in dark hearts, in a moment it lights up every dark recess of the
heart's ungodliness, and bids the soul tremble before the Lord.

"In his temple doth every one speak of his glory." Those who were
worshipping in the temple, were led to speak of the greatness of Jehovah
as they heard the repeated thunder-claps. The whole world is also a
temple for God, and when he rides abroad upon the wings of the wind, all
things are vocal in his praise. We too, the redeemed of the Lord, who
are living temples for his Spirit, as we see the wonders of his power in
creation, and feel them in grace, unite to magnify his name. No tongue
may be dumb in God's temple when his glory is the theme. The original
appears to have the force of "every one crieth Glory," as though all
things were moved by a sense of God's majesty to shout in ecstasy,
"Glory, glory." Here is a good precedent for our Methodist friends and
for the Gogoniants of the zealous Welsh.

[Psa 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#010.md)

"The Lord sitteth upon the flood." Flood follows tempest, but Jehovah is
ready for the emergency. No deluge can undermine the foundation of his
throne. He is calm and unmoved, however much the deep may roar and be
troubled: his government rules the most unstable and boisterous of
created things. Far out on the wild waste of waters, Jehovah "plants his
footsteps in the sea, and rides upon the storm," "Yea, the Lord sitteth
King for ever." Jesus has the government upon his shoulders eternally:
our interests in the most stormy times are safe in his hands. Satan is
not king, but Jehovah Jesus is; therefore let us worship him, and
rejoice evermore.

[Psalms 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 29:11</span></span>

11 The Lord will give strength unto his people; the Lord will bless his
people with peace.

Power was displayed in the hurricane whose course this Psalm so grandly
pictures; and now, in the cool calm after the storm, that power is
promised to be the strength of the chosen. He who wings the unerring
bolt, will give to his redeemed the wings of eagles; he who shakes the
earth with his voice, will terrify the enemies of his saints, and give
his children peace. Why are we weak when we have divine strength to flee
to? Why are we troubled when the Lord's own peace is ours? Jesus the
mighty God is our peace - what a blessing is this today! What a blessing
it will be to us in that day of the Lord which will be in darkness and
not light to the ungodly!

Dear reader, is not this a noble Psalm to be sung in stormy weather? Can
you sing amid the thunder? Will you be able to sing when the last
thunders are let loose, and Jesus judges quick and dead? If you are a
believer, the last verse is your heritage, and surely that will set you
singing.
