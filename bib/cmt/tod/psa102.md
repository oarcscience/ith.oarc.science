### [Psalms Chapter 102](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 102:0</span></span>

Subject. - This is a patriot's lament over his country's distress. He
arrays himself in the griefs of his nation as in a garment of sackcloth,
and casts her dust and ashes upon his head as the ensigns and causes of
his sorrow. He has his own private woes and personal enemies, he is
moreover sore afflicted in body by sickness, but the miseries of his
people cause him afar more bitter anguish, and this he pours out in an
earnest, pathetic lamentation. Not, however, without hope does the
patriot mourn; he has faith in God, and looks for the resurrection of
the nation through the omnipotent favour of the Lord; this causes him to
walk among the ruins of Jerusalem, and to say with hopeful spirit, "No,
Zion, thou shall never perish. Thy sun is not set for ever; brighter
days are in store for thee." It is in vain to enquire into the precise
point of Israel's history which thus stirred a patriot's soul, for many
a time was the land oppressed, and at any of her sad seasons this song
and prayer would have been a most natural and appropriate utterance.

Title. - A prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth
out his complaint before the Lord, This Psalm is a prayer far more in
spirit than in words. The formal petitions are Jew, but a strong stream
of supplication runs from beginning to end, and like an under-current,
finds its way heavenward through the moanings of grief and confessions
of faith which make up the major part of the Psalm. It is a prayer of
the afflicted, or of "a sufferer," and it bears the marks of its
parentage; as it is recorded of Jabez, that "his mother bore him with
sorrow," so may we say of this Psalm; yet as Rachel's Benoni, or child
of sorrow, was also her Benjamin, or son of her right hand, so is this
Psalm as eminently expressive of consolation as of desolation. It is
scarcely correct to call it a penitential Psalm, for the sorrow of it is
rather of one suffering than sinning. It has its own bitterness, and it
is not the same as that of [Psa 51:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#001.md).
The sufferer is afflicted more for others than for himself, more for
Zion and the house of the Lord, than for his own house. When he is
overwhelmed, or sorely troubled, and depressed. The best of men are not
always able to stem the torrent of sorrow. Even when Jesus is on board,
the vessel may fill with water and begin to sink. And poureth out his
complaint before the Lord. When a cup is overwhelmed or turned bottom
over, all that is in it is naturally poured out; great trouble removes
the heart from all reserve, and causes the soul to flow out without
restraint; it is well when that which is in the soul is such as may be
poured out in the presence of God, and this is only the case where the
heart has been renewed by divine grace. The word rendered "complaint"
has in it none of the idea of fault-finding or repining, but should
rather be rendered "moaning," - the expression of pain, not of
rebellion.

To help the memory we will call this Psalm the Patriot's Plaint.

Division - In the first part of the Psalm, [Psa
102:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#001.md), the moaning monopolizes
every verse, the lamentation is unceasing, sorrow rules the hour. The
second portion, from 12-28, has a vision of better things, a view of the
gracious Lord, and his eternal existence and care for his people, and
therefore it is interspersed with sunlight as well as shaded by the
cloud, and it ends up right gloriously with calm confidence for the
future, and sweet restfulness in the Lord. The whole composition may be
compared to a day which, opening with wind and rain, clears up at noon
and is warm with the sun, continues fine, with intervening showers, and
finally closes with a brilliant sunset.

their complaint, not an oratorical display.

IV\. Afflicted men are accepted in prayer - for this prayer is placed on
record.

[Psa 102:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#001.md), [Psa

102:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#017.md), [Psa
102:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#019.md), [Psa
102:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#020.md). - An interesting discourse may
be founded upon these passages.

I. The Lord entreated to hear - [Psa
102:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#001.md).

II\. The Promise given that he will hear - [Psa
102:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#017.md).

102:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#019.md) and [Psa
102:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#020.md).

[Psa 102:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#002.md). -

I. Prayer in trouble is most needed.

II\. Prayer in trouble is most heeded.

III\. Prayer in trouble is most speeded: "Answer me speedily."

Or,

I. Prayer in trouble: "In the day," etc.

II\. The prayer of trouble: "Hide not thy face;" not remove the trial,
but be with me in it. A fiery furnace is a paradise when God is with us
there. - G. R.

[Psa 102:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#002) (first clause.md). - He
deprecates the loss of the divine countenance when under trouble.

I. That would intensify it a thousandfold.

II\. That would deprive him of strength to bear the trouble.

III\. That would prevent his acting so as to glorify God in the trouble.

IV\. That might injure the result of the trouble.

[Psa 102:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#002) (last clause.md). -

I. We often need to be answered speedily.

II\. God can so answer.

III\. God has so answered.

IV\. God has promised so to answer.

[Psa 102:3-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#003.md). -

I. The causes of grief.

1\. The brevity of life. [Psa 102:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#003.md).

2\. Bodily pain: [Psa 102:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#003.md).

3\. Dejection of spirit. [Psa 102:4, 19
102:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#004.md).

7\. The hidings of God's countenance. [Psa
102:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#010.md).

8\. Wasting away. [Psa 102:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#011.md).

II\. The eloquence of grief.

1\. The brevity of life is as vanishing "smoke."

2\. Bodily pain is fire in the bones.

3\. Dejection of spirit is "withered grass." Who can eat when the heart
is sad?

4\. Solitariness is like "The pelican in the wilderness, the owl in the
desert, and the sparrow upon the house top."

5\. Reproach is being surrounded by madmen - "they that are mad."

6\. Humiliation is "eating ashes like breast," and "drinking tears."

7\. The hidings of God's countenance is lifting up in order to be cast
down.

8\. Wasting away is a shadow declining and grass withering. - G. R.

[Psa 102:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#004.md). - Unbelieving sorrow makes
us forget to use proper means for our support.

I. We forget the promises.

II\. Forget the past and its experiences.

III\. Forget the Lord Jesus, our life.

IV\. Forget the everlasting love of God. This leads to weakness,
faintness, etc., and is to be avoided.

[Psa 102:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#006.md). - This as a text, together
with [Psa 103:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#005.md), makes an interesting
contrast, and gives scope for much experimental teaching.

[Psa 102:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#007.md). - The evils and benefits
of solitude; when it may be sought, and when it becomes a folly. Or, the
mournful watcher - alone, outside the pale of communion, insignificant,
wishful for fellowship, set apart to watch.

[Psa 102:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#009.md). - The sorrows of the
saints - their number, bitterness, sources, correctives, influences, and
consolations.

[Psa 102:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#010.md). -

I. The trial of trials - thine indignation and thy wrath.

II\. The aggravation of that trial - former favour, "thou hast lifted me
up," etc.

III\. The best behaviour under it: see [Psa
102:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#009.md), and [Psa
102:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#012.md) and [Psa
102:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013.md).

[Psa 102:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#010) (last clause..md) - The
prosperity of a church or an individual often followed by declension;
worldly aggrandisement frequently succeeded by affliction; great joy in
the Lord very generally succeeded by trial.

[Psa 102:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#011.md), [Psa
102:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#012.md). - I and Thou, or the notable
contrast.

I. I: my days are like a shadow,

1\. Because it is unsubstantial; because it partakes of the nature of
the darkness which is to absorb it; because the longer it becomes the
briefer its continuance.

2\. I am like grass cut down by the scythe; scorched by drought.

II\. Thou: Lord. Ever enduring. Ever memorable. Ever the study of
passing generations of men. - C. D.

[Psa 102:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013.md). -

I. Zion often needs restoration. It needs "mercy."

II\. Its restoration is certain, "Thou shalt arise," etc.

III\. The seasons of its restoration are determined. There is a "time"
to favour her; a "set" time.

IV\. Intimations of those coming seasons are often given: "The time, the
set time, is come." - G. R.

[Psa 102:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013.md), [Psa
102:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#014.md). -

I. Visitation expected.

II\. Predestination relied upon.

III\. Evidence observed.

IV\. Enquiry suggested - Do we take pleasure in her stones? etc.

[Psa 102:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013.md), [Psa
102:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#014.md). - The interest of the Lord's
people in the concerns of Zion one of the surest signs of her returning
prosperity.

[Psa 102:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#015.md). - The inward prosperity
of the church essential to her power in the world.

[Psa 102:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#016.md). - God is Zion's
purchaser, architect, builder, inhabitant, Lord.

I. Zion built up. Conversions frequent; confessions numerous; union
firm; edification solid; missions extended.

II\. God glorified. In its very foundation; by its ministry; by
difficulties and enemies; by poor workers, and poor materials; and even
by our failures.

III\. Hope excited. Because we may expect the Lord to glorify himself.

IV\. Inquiry suggested. Am I concerned, as built, or building? not
merely doctrinally, but experimentally?

[Psa 102:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#017.md). -

I. The destitute pray.

II\. They pray most.

III\. They pray best.

IV\. They pray most effectually. Or the surest way to succeed in prayer
is to pray as the destitute; show the reason of this.

[Psa 102:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#018.md). -

I. A memorial.

II\. A magnificat. - W. Durban.

[Psa 102:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#018.md). -

I. Misery in extremis.

II\. Divinity observant.

III\. Deity actively assisting.

IV\. Glory consequently published.

[Psa 102:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#019.md). -

I. The notice which God takes of the world, [Psa
102:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#019.md).

1\. The place from which he beholds it: "from heaven," not from an
earthly point of view.

2\. The character in which he beholds it; "from the height of his
sanctuary," from the mercy-seat.

II\. What attracts his notice most in the world. The groaning of the
prisoner and of those appointed to death.

III\. The purpose for which he notices them. "To loose," etc.; "to
declare," etc.

1\. For human comfort.

2\. For his own glory.

IV\. When his notice is thus fixed upon the earth. "When," etc., [Psa
102:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#022.md). - G. R.

[Psa 102:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#023.md). - For the sick.

I. Submission - The Lord sent the trial - "He weakeneth," etc.

II\. Service - exonerated from some work, he now requires of me
patience, earnestness, etc.

III\. Preparation - for going home.

IV\. Prayer - for others to occupy my place.

V. Expectation - I shall soon be in heaven, now that my days are
shortened.

[Psa 102:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#024.md). -

I. The prayer. "Take me not away," etc.

1\. Not in the midst of life, is the prayer of some.

2\. Not in the midst of worldly prosperity, is the prayer of many, for
the sake of those dependent upon them.

3\. Not in the midst of spiritual growth, is the prayer of not a few:
"Oh spare me, that I may recover strength," etc.

4\. Not in the midst of Christian work and usefulness, is the prayer of
others.

II\. The plea. "Thy years," etc.; years are plentiful with thee,
therefore to give me longer days will be an easy gift - and thine own
are throughout all generations. - G. R.

[Psa 102:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#025.md). -

I. The unchangeableness of God amidst past changes: "of old," etc.

1\. He was the same before as after he had laid the foundations of the
earth.

2\. He was the same after as before.

II\. The unchangeableness of God amidst future changes. "They shall
perish," etc.

1\. The same before they perish as after.

2\. After as before.

III\. The unchangeableness of God in the past and the future. "Thou art
the same," etc. - G. R.

[Psa 102:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#026.md), [Psa
102:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#027.md). -

I. How far God may change - only in his garments, or outward
manifestations of creation and providence.

II\. Wherein he cannot change - his nature, attributes, covenant, love,
etc.

III\. The comfortable truths which may be safely inferred, or which
gather support from this fact.

[Psa 102:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#026.md), [Psa
102:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#027.md). -

I. The material universe of God.

1\. No more to him than a garment to the wearer.

2\. Ever waxing old, but he the same.

3\. Soon to be changed, and left to perish, but of his years no end.

II\. Our relation to each -

1\. Let us never love the dress more than the wearer.

2\. Nor trust more in the changeful than in the abiding.

3\. Nor live for that which will die out.

[Psa 102:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#028.md). - The true apostolical
succession.

I. There always will be saints.

II\. They will frequently be the seed of the saints after the flesh.

III\. They will always be the spiritual seed of the godly, for God
converts one by means of another.

IV\. We should order our efforts with an eye to the church's future.

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Title

"A prayer," etc. The prayer following is longer than others. When Satan,
the Law-Adversary, doth extend his pleas against us, it is meet that we
should enlarge our counter pleas for our own souls; as the powers of
darkness do lengthen and multiply their wrestlings, so must we our
counter wrestlings of prayer. [Eph
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012.md), [Eph
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#018.md). - Thomas Cobbet, 1657.

Title

"When he ... poureth out," etc. Here we have the manner of the church's
prayer suitable to her extremity illustrated by a simile taken from a
vessel overcharged with new wine or strong liquor, that bursts for vent.
Oh the heart-bursting cries she sends out all the day! Here is no lazy,
slothful, lip labour, stinted form of prayer, no empty sounds of verbal
expressions, which can never procure; nor a comfortable answer from her
God, or the least case to her burthened soul; but poured-out prayers as
Hannah, [Sa1 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#015.md), and Jeremy, [Lam
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#012.md), pressed forth with vehemence of
spirit and heart pangs of inward grief, thus the Lord deals with his
church and people; ere he pours out cups of consolation they must pour
out tears in great measure. - Finiens Canes Vove.

Title

This is the mourner's prayer when he is

And to the Eternal Father breathes his plaint.

\- John Keble.

Whole Psalm

The Psalm has been attributed to Daniel, to Jeremiah, to Nehemiah, or to
some of the other prophets who flourished during the time of the
captivity. The author of the Epistle to the Hebrews has applied [Psa
102:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#025.md) to our Lord, and the
perpetuity of his kingdom. - Adam Clarke.

Whole Psalm

I doubt whether, without apostolic teaching, any of us would have had
the boldness to understand it; for in many respects it is the most
remarkable of all the Psalms - the Psalm of "the afflicted One" - while
his soul is overwhelmed within him in great affliction, and sorrow, and
anxious fear. - Adolph Saphir, in "Expository Lectures on the Epistle to
the Hebrews."

[Psa 102:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#001.md)

"Hear my prayer, O Lord, and let my cry come unto thee." When, at any
time, we see the beggars, or poor folks, that are pained and grieved
with hunger and cold, lying in the streets of cities and towns, full of
sores, we are somewhat moved inwardly with pity and mercy; but if we our
own selves attend and give ear to their wailings, cryings, and
lamentable noises that they make, we should be much more stirred to show
our pity and mercy on them; for no man else can show the grief of the
sick and sore persons, so well and in so pathetic a manner as he
himself. Therefore, since the miserable crying and wailing of those that
suffer bodily pain and misery can prevail so much upon the hearts of
mortal creatures; I doubt not, Good Lord, but thou, who art all
merciful, must needs be inclined to exercise thy mercy, if my sorrowful
cry and petition may come unto thine ears, or into thy presence. - John
Fisher (1459-1535) in "A Treatise concerning the fruitful Sayings of
David," 1714.

[Psa 102:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#001.md)

"My prayer." His own, and not another's; not what was composed for him,
but composed by him; which came out of his own heart, and out of
unfeigned lips, and expressed under a feeling sense of his own wants and
troubles; and though dictated and inwrought in his heart by the Spirit
of God, yet, being put up by him in faith and fervency, it is called his
own, and which he desires might be heard. - John Gill.

[Psa 102:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#001.md)

"My cry." Lest my praying should not prevail, behold, O God, I raise it
to a cry; and crying, I may say, is the greatest bell in all the ring of
praying: for louder thatn crying I cannot pray. O, then, if not my
prayer, at least "let my cry come unto thee." If I be not heard when I
cry, I shall cry for not being heard; and if heard when I cry, I shall
cry to be heard yet more; and so whether heard or not heard, I shall cry
still, and God grant I may cry still; so thou be pleased, O God, to
"hear my prayer," and to "let my cry come unto thee." - Sir R. Baker.

[Psa 102:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#001.md), [Psa
102:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#002.md)

This language is the language of godly sorrow, of faith, of tribulation,
and of anxious hope: of faith, for the devout suppliant lifts up his
heart and voice to heaven, "as seeing him who is invisible," ([Heb
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#027).md) and entreats him to hear his
prayer and listen to his crying of tribulation, for he describes himself
as enduring affliction, and unwilling to lose the countenance of the
Lord in the time of his trouble: of anxious hope, for he seems to
expect, in the midst of his groaning, that his prayers, like those of
Cornelius, will "go up for a memorial before God" who will hear him,
"and that right soon." - Charles Oxenden, in "Sermons on the Seven
Penitential Psalms," 1838.

[Psa 102:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#001.md), [Psa
102:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#002.md)

The Lord suffereth his babbling children to speak to him in their own
form of speech, (albeit the terms which they use be not fitted for his
spiritual, invisible, and incomprehensible majesty); such as are, "Hear
me, hide not thy face, incline thine ear to me," and such like other
speeches. - David Dickson.

[Psa 102:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#001.md), [Psa
102:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#002.md)

Note, David sent his prayer as a sacred ambassador to God. Now there are
four things requisite to make an embassy prosperous. The ambassador must
be regarded with favourable eye: he must be heard with a ready ear: he
must speedily return when his demands are conceded. These four things
David as a suppliant asks from God his King. - Le Blanc.

[Psa 102:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#002.md)

"Incline thine ear unto me." The great exhaustion of the afflicted one
is hinted at: so worn out is he, that he is hardly able to cry any more,
but with a faint voice only feebly mutters, like a weak, sick man, whose
voice if we would catch, we must incline the ear. - Martin Geier.

[Psa 102:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#003.md)

"Consumed like smoke," would be better read, "pass away as in smoke," as
if they disappeared into smoke and ashes. "Burned as an hearth," is not
a felicitous translation, for a "hearth" should be incombustible. Better
"burned as a faggot," as any fuel. The sentiment, My days waste away to
nothing, turn to no good account, are lost. - Henry Cowles.

[Psa 102:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#003.md)

"My days are consumed like smoke;" or, as Hebrew, literally, "in (into)
smoke." The very same expression which David, in [Psa
37:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#020.md), had used of "the enemies of the
Lord:.... They shall consume into smoke" (compare [Psa
68:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#002).md). Hereby the ideal sufferer
virtually complains that the lot of the wicked befalls him, though being
righteous ([Psa 101:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#001).md). - A. R.
Fausset.

[Psa 102:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#003.md)

"My days are consumed like smoke." As the smoke is a vapour proceeding
from the fire, yet hath no heat in it; so my days are come from the
torrid zone of youth into the region of cold and age; and as the smoke
seems a thick substance for the present, but presently vanisheth into
air; so my days made as great shew at first as if they would never have
been spent; but now, alas, are wasted and leave me scarce a being. As
the smoke is fuliginous and dark, and affords no pleasure to lock upon
it; so my days are all black and in mourning; no joy nor pleasure to be
taken in them. And as the smoke ascends indeed, but by ascending wastes
itself and comes to nothing: so my days are wasted in growing, are
diminished in increasing; their plenty hath made a scarcity, and the
more they have been the fewer they are. And how, indeed, can my days
choose but be consumed as smoke, when "my bones are burned as an
hearth"? for as when the hearth is burned there can be made no more fire
upon it; so, when my bones, which are as the hearth upon which my fire
of life is made, come once to be burned; how can any more fire of life
be made upon them? and when no fire can be made, what will remain but
only smoke? - Sir R. Baker.

[Psa 102:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#003.md)

"As an hearth." Or, as a trivet, or, gridiron; so the Targum: or, as a
frying-pan: so the Arabic version. - John Gill.

[Psa 102:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#004.md)

"My heart is smitten, and withered like grass." The metaphor here is
taken from grass, cut down in the meadow. It is first "smitten" with the
scythe, and then "withered" by the sun. Thus the Jews were smitten with
the judgments of God; and they are now withered under the fire of the
Chaldeans. - Adam Clarke.

[Psa 102:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#004.md)

"I forget to eat my bread." I have heard of some that have forgotten
their own names, but I never heard of any that forgot to eat his meat;
for there is a certain prompter called hunger that will make a man to
remember his meat in spite of his teeth. And yet it is true, when the
heart is blasted and withered like grass, such a forgetfulness of
necessity will follow. Is it that the withering of the heart is the
prime cause of sorrow; at least cause of the prime sorrow; and
immoderate sorrow is the mother of stupidity, stupefying and benumbing
the animal faculties, that neither the understanding nor the memory can
execute their functions? Or is it, that sorrow is so intentive to that
it sorrows for, that it cannot intend to think anything else? Or is it,
that nature makes account, that to feed in sorrow were to feed sorrow,
and therefore thinks best to forbear all eating? Or is it, that as
sorrow draws moisture from the brain and fills the eyes with water; so
it draws a like juice from other parts, which fills the stomach instead
of meat? However it be, it shews a wonderful operation that is in
sorrow; to make not only the stomach to refuse its meat, but to make the
brain forget the stomach, between whom there is so natural a sympathy
and so near a correspondence. But as the rigour of the heart breeds
plenty of spirits, which conveyed to all the parts, gives every one a
natural appetite; so when the heart is blasted and withered like grass,
and that there is no more any rigour in it, the spirits are presently at
a stand, and then no marvel if the stomach lose its appetite, and forget
to eat bread. - Sir R. Baker.

[Psa 102:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#004.md)

"I forget to eat my bread." When grief hath thus dejected the spirits,
the man has no appetite for that food which is to recruit and elevate
them. Ahab, smitten with one kind of grief, David with another, and
Daniel with a third, all forgot, or refused, to eat their bread. [Kg1
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#004.md); [Sa2
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#016.md); [Dan
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#003.md). Such natural companions are
mourning and fasting. - Samuel Burder.

[Psa 102:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#005.md)

"My bones cleave to my skin." When the bones cleave to the skin, both
are near cleaving to the dust. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 102:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#005.md)

That grief readily causes the body to pine away is very well known. It
is related of Cardinal Wolsey, by an eye-witness, that when he heard
that his master's favour was turned from him, he was wrung with such an
agony of grief, which continued a whole night, that in the morning his
face was dwindled away into half its usual dimensions.

[Psa 102:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#006.md)

"I am like a pelican of the wilderness." The Kaath was a bird of
solitude that was to be found in the "wilderness," i.e., far from the
habitations of man. This is one of the characteristics of the pelican,
which loves not the neighbourhood of human beings, and is fond of
resorting to broad, uncultivated lands, where it will not be disturbed.
In them it makes its nest and hatches its young, and to them it retires
after feeding, in order to digest in quiet the ample meal which it has
made. Mr. Tristram well suggests that the metaphor of the Psalmist may
allude to the habit common to the pelican and its kin, of sitting
motionless for hours after it has gorged itself with food, its head sunk
on its shoulders, and its bill resting on its breast. - J. G. Wood.

[Psa 102:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#006.md)

"A pelican of the wilderness." Here only \[at Hulet\] have I seen the
pelican of the wilderness, as David calls it. I once had one of them
shot just below this place, and, as it was merely wounded in the wing, I
had a good opportunity to study its character. It was certainly the most
sombre, austere bird I ever saw. It gave one the blues merely to look at
it. David could find no more expressive type of solitude and melancholy
by which to illustrate his own sad state. It seemed as large as a
half-grown donkey, and when fairly settled on its stout legs, it looked
like one. The pelican is never seen but in these unfrequented solitudes.
- W. M. Thomson.

[Psa 102:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#006.md)

Consider that thou needest not complain, like Elijah, that thou art left
alone, seeing the best of God's saints in all ages have smarted in the
same kind - instance in David: indeed sometimes he boasts how he 'lay in
green pastures, and was led by still waters;' but after he bemoans that
he 'sinks in deep mire, where there was no standing.' What is become of
those green pastures? parched up with the drought. Where are those still
waters? troubled with the tempest of affliction. The same David compares
himself to an "owl," and in the next Psalm resembles himself to an
"eagle." Do two fowls fly of more different kind? The one the scorn, the
other the sovereign; the one the slowest, the other the swiftest; the
one the most sharp-sighted, the other the most dim-eyed of all birds.
Wonder not, then, to find in thyself sudden and strange alterations. It
fared thus with all God's servants in their agonies of temptation; and
be confident thereof, though now run aground with grief, in due time
thou shalt be all afloat with comfort. - Thomas Fuller.

[Psa 102:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#006.md)

"Owl." Some kind of owl, it is thought, is intended by the Hebrew word
côs, translated "little owl," in [Lev
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#017.md); [Deu
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#010.md), where it is mentioned amongst
the unclean birds. It occurs also in [Psa
102:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#006.md). "I am like a pelican of the
wilderness, I am like an owl of ruined places" (A. V., "desert"). The
Hebrew word côs means a "cup" in some passages of Scripture, from a root
meaning to "receive," to "hide," or "bring together"; hence the pelican,
"the cup," or "pouch-bird," has been suggested as the bird intended. In
this case the verse in the Psalm would be rendered thus: - "I am become
like a pelican in the wilderness, even as the pouch-bird in the desert
places." But the fact that both the pelican and the côs are enumerated
in the list of birds to be avoided as food is against this theory,
unless the word changed its meaning in the Psalmist's time, which is
improbable. The expression côs "of ruined places" looks very much as if
some owl were denoted, The Arabic definitely applies a kindred
expression as one of the names of an owl, viz., um elcharab, i.e.,
"mother of ruins." The Septuagint gives νυκτικόραξ as the meaning of
côs; and we know from Aristotle that the Greek word was a synonym of
ὦτος, evidently, from his description of the bird, one of the eared
owls. Dr. Tristram is disposed to refer the côs to the little Athene
Persica, the most common of all the owls in Palestine, the
representative of the A. noctua of Southern Europe. The Arabs call this
bird "boomah," from his note; he is described "as a grotesque and
comical-looking little bird, familiar and yet cautious; never moving
unnecessarily, but remaining glued to his perch, unless he has good
reason for believing he has been detected, and twisting and turning his
head instead of his eyes to watch what is going on." He is to be found
amongst rocks in the wadys or trees by the water-side, in olive yards,
in the tombs and on the ruins, on the sandy mounds of Beersheba, and on
"the spray-beaten fragments of Tyre, where his low wailing note is sure
to be heard at sunset, and himself seen bowing and keeping time to his
own music." W. Houghton, in "Cassell's Biblical Educator," 1874.

[Psa 102:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#006.md)

"Owl of the desert."

Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tower,

The moping owl does to the moon complain

Of such as, wand'ring near her secret bow'r,

Molest her ancient solitary reign.

\- Thomas Gray (1716-1771).

[Psa 102:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#007.md)

"I watch." During the hours allotted to sleep "I wake," like a little
bird which sits solitary on the house top, while all beneath enjoy the
sleep which he giveth to his beloved. - Alfred Edersheim.

[Psa 102:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#007.md)

"A sparrow alone upon the house top." When one of them has lost its mate
- a matter of every-day occurrence - he will sit on the house top alone,
and lament by the hour his sad bereavement. - W. M. Thomson.

[Psa 102:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#007.md)

"I am as a sparrow alone," etc. It is evident that the "sparrow alone
and melancholy upon the house tops" cannot be the lively, gregarious
sparrow which assembles in such numbers on these favourite
feeding-places \[the house tops of the East\]. We must therefore look
for some other bird, and naturalists are now agreed that we may accept
the Blue Thrush (Petrocossyphus cyaneus) as the particular tzippor, or
small bird, which sits alone on the house tops. The colour of this bird
is a dark blue, whence it derives its popular name. Its habits exactly
correspond with the idea of solitude and melancholy. The Blue Thrushes
never assemble in flocks, and it is very rare to see more than a pair
together. It is fond of sitting on the tops of houses, uttering its
note, which, however agreeable to itself, is monotonous and melancholy
to a human ear. - J. G. Wood, in "Bible Animals."

[Psa 102:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#007.md)

"A sparrow." Most readers are struck with the incongruity of the image,
as it appears in our version, intended by the Psalmist to express a
condition of distress and desolation. The sparrow is found, indeed, all
over the East, in connection with houses, as it is with ourselves; but
it is everywhere one of the most social of birds, cheerful to
impertinence; and mischievously disposed, instead of being retiring in
its habits, and melancholy in its demeanour. The word, in the original,
is a general term for all the small birds, insectivorous and
frugivirous, denominated clean, and that might be eaten according to the
law, the thrushes, larks, wagtails, finches, as well as sparrows. It
seems to be, indeed, a mere imitation of their common note, like the one
which we have in the word "chirrup." Most critics are, therefore,
content with the rendering "solitary bird," or "solitary little bird."
But this is very unsatisfactory. It does not identify the species; and
there is every probability that there must have been a particular bird
which the Psalmist, writing at the close of the Babylonish captivity,
had in his eye, corresponding to his representation of it, and
illustrative of his isolated condition. Such there is at the present
day, of common occurrence in Southern Europe and Western Asia. Its
history is very little known to the world, and its existence has
hitherto escaped the notice of all biblical commentators. Remarkably
enough, the bird is commonly, but erroneously, called a sparrow, for it
is a real thrush in size, in shape, in habits, and in song. It differs
singularly from the rest of the tribe, throughout all the East, by a
marked preference for sitting solitary upon the habitation of man. It
never associates with any other, and only at one season with its own
mate; and even then it is often seen quite alone upon the house top,
where it warbles its sweet and plaintive strains, and continues its
song, moving from roof to roof. America has its solitary thrush, of
another species, and of somewhat different habits. The dark solitary
cane and myrtle swamps of the southern states are there the favourite
haunts of the recluse bird; and the more dense and gloomy these are the
more certainly is it to be found flitting in them. - "The Biblical.
Treasury."

[Psa 102:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#007.md)

"Alone." But little do men perceive what solitude is, and how far it
extendeth; for a crowd is not company, and faces are but a gallery of
pictures, an talk but a tinkling cymbal where there is no love. The
Latin adage meeteth it a little: "magna civitas, magno solitudo;"
because in a great town friends are scattered, so that there is not that
fellowship, for the most part, which is in less neighbourhoods; but we
may go further, and affirm most truly, that it is a mere and miserable
solitude to want true friends, without which the world is but a
wilderness; and even in this sense also of solitude, whosoever in the
frame of his nature and affections is unfit for friendship, he taketh it
of the beast, and not from humanity. - Francis Bacon.

[Psa 102:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#007.md)

"Alone." See the reason why people in trouble love solitariness. They
are full of sorrow; and sorrow, if it have taken deep root, is naturally
reserved, and flies all conversation. Grief is a thing that is very
silent and private. Those people that are very talkative and clamorous
in their sorrows, are never very sorrowful. Some are apt to wonder, why
melancholy people delight to be so much alone, and I will tell you the
reason of it.

1\. Because the disordered humours of their bodies alter their temper,
their humours, and their inclinations, that they are no more the same
that they used to be; their very distemper is averse to what is joyous
and diverting; and they that wonder at them may as wisely wonder why
they will be diseased, which they would not be if they knew how to help
it; but the Disease of Melancholy is so obstinate, and so unknown to all
but those who have it, that nothing but the power of God can totally
overthrow it, and I know no other cure for it.

2\. Another reason why they choose to be alone is, because people do not
generally mind what they say, nor believe them, but rather deride them,
which they do not use so cruelly to do with those that are in other
distempers; and no man is to be blamed for avoiding society, when it
does not afford the common credit to his words that is due to the rest
of men. But,

3\. Another, and the principal reason why people in trouble and sadness
choose to be alone, is, because they generally apprehend themselves
singled out to be the marks of God's peculiar displeasure, and they are
often by their sharp afflictions a terror to themselves, and a wonder to
others. It even breaks their hearts to see how low they are fallen, how
oppressed, that were once as easy, as pleasant, as full of hope as
others are, [Job 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#021.md) : "Ye see my
casting down, and are afraid." [Psa
71:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#007.md). "I am as a wonder unto many."
And it is usually unpleasant to others to be with them. [Psa
88:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#018.md), "Lover and friend hast thou put
far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkness." And though it was not
so with the friends of Job, to see a man whom they had once known happy,
to be so miserable; one whom they had seen so very prosperous, to be so
very poor, in such sorry, forlorn circumstances, did greatly affect
them; he, poor man, was changed, they knew him not, [Job
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#012.md), [Job
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#013.md), "And when they lifted up their
eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept;
and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads
toward heaven. So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and
seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his
grief was very great." As the prophet represents one under spiritual and
great afflictions, "that he sitteth alone, and keepeth silence," [Lam
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#028). - Timothy Rogers (1660-1729.md), in
"A Discourse on Trouble of Mind, and the Disease of Melancholy."

[Psa 102:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#008.md)

"Mine enemies reproach me." It is true what Plutarch writes, that men
are more touched with reproaches than with other injuries; affliction,
too, gives a keener edge to calumny, for the afflicted are more fitting
objects of pity than of mockery. - Mollerus.

[Psa 102:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#008.md)

"Mine enemies reproach me," etc. If I be where they are they rail at me
to my face; and if I be not amongst them they revile me behind my back;
and they do it not by starts and fits, that might give me some breathing
time; but they are spitting their poison all the day long; and not
single and one by one, that might leave hope of resisting; but they make
combinations, and enter leagues against me; and to make their leagues
the stronger, and less subject to dissolving, they bind themselves by
oath, and take the sacrament upon it. And now sum up all these miseries
and afflictions; begin with my fasting; then take my groaning; then add
my watching; then the shame of being wondered at in company; then the
discomfort of sitting disconsolate alone; and, lastly, add to these the
spite and malice of my enemies; and what marvel, then, if these miseries
joined all together make me altogether miserable; what marvel if I be
nothing but skin and bone, when no flesh that were wise would ever stay
upon a body to endure such misery. - Sir R. Baker.

[Psa 102:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#008) (last clause.md)

Swearing by one, means, to make his name a by-word of execration, or an
example of cursing. ([Isa 65:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#015.md); [Jer
29:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#022.md); [Jer

Lange's Commentary.

[Psa 102:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#009.md)

"I have eaten ashes like bread." Though the bread indeed be strange, yet
not so strange as this, - that having complained before of forgetting to
eat his bread, he should now on a sudden fall to eating of ashes like
bread. For had he not been better to have forgotten it still, unless it
had been more worth remembering? For there is not in nature so unfit a
thing to eat as ashes; it is worse than Nebuchadnezzar's grass. - Sir R.
Baker.

[Psa 102:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#009.md)

"I have mingled my drink with weeping." If you think his bread to be
bad, you will find his drink to be worse; for he mingles his drink with
tears: and what are tears, but brinish and salt humours? and is brine a
fit liquor to quench one's thirst? May we not say here, the remedy is
worse than the disease? for were it not better to endure any thirst,
than to seek to quench it with such drink? Is it not a pitiful thing to
have no drink to put in the stomach, but that which is drawn out of the
eyes? and yet whose case is any better? No man certainly commits sin,
but with a design of pleasure; but sin will not be so committed; for
whosoever commit sin, let them be sure at some time or other to find a
thousand times more trouble about it than ever they found pleasure in
it. For all sin is a kind of surfeit, and there is no way to keep it
from being mortal but by this strict diet of eating ashes like bread and
mingling his drink with tears. O my soul, if these be works of
repentance in David, where shall we find a penitent in the world besides
himself? To talk of repentance is obvious in everyone's mouth; but where
is any that eats ashes like bread, and mingles his drink with tears? -
Sir R. Baker.

[Psa 102:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#010.md)

"For thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down." Thou hast lifted me up
of a great height, in that thou madest me like unto thine image,
touching my reasonable soul, and hast given me power, by thy grace, to
inherit the everlasting joys of heaven, both body and soul, if I did
live here after thy commandments. What greater gift canst thou give me,
Lord, than to have the fruition of thee that art all in all things? How
canst thou lift me higher than to eternal beatitude? But then, alas,
thou hast letten me fall down again, for thou hast joined my noble soul
with an earthly, heavy, and a frail body; the weight and burden thereof
draweth down my mind and heart from the consideration of thy goodness,
and from-well doing, unto all kinds of vices, and to the regarding of
temporal things according to his nature. The earthly mansion keepeth
down the understanding. Thus setting me up, as it were, above the wind,
thou hast given me a very great fall ([Job
30:22](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#022).md). I am in creation above all
other kind of earthly creatures, and almost equal with angels; but being
in this estate thou hast knit a knot thereto, that for breaking the
least of thy commandments I shall suffer damnation. So that without thy
continual mercy and help I am in worse case herein than any brute beast,
whose life or soul dieth with the body. - Sir Anthony Cope (1551).

[Psa 102:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#010.md)

"For thou hast lifted me up and cast me down." That is that I might fall
with greater poise. Significatur gravissima collisio. Here the prophet
accuseth not God of cruelty, but bewaileth his own misery. Miserum est
fuisse felicem, it is no small unhappiness to have been happy. - John
Trapp.

[Psa 102:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#011) (first clause.md)

My days (my term of life) are as the lengthened shade, the lengthening
shade of evening, that shows the near approach of night. The comparison,

The "and I," in the Hebrew stands in designed contrast to "But thou,"

"Thou shalt arise, and have mercy," etc. Tu miserebere, "Thou shalt," as
the Shunamite to the prophet, catching hold on his feet, though Gehazi
thrust her away, Vivit Dominus, "As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul
liveth, I will not let time go;" and, as Jacob to the angel, when he had
wrestled the whole night with him, Non dimittam, I will not let thee
loose till I have a blessing from thee. - From "A Sermon at Paules
Crosse on behalfe of Paules Church, March 26, 1620. By the B. of London"
\[John King\].

[Psa 102:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013.md)

"The set time." There is a certain set time for God's great actions. He
lets the powers of darkness have their hour, and God will take his hour.
He hath a set time for the discovery of his mercy, and he will not stay
a lot beyond it. What is this time? [Psa
102:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#009.md), etc. When they "eat ashes like
bread, and mingle their drink with weeping;" when they are most humble,
and when the servants of God have moral affection to the church; when
their humble and ardent affections are strong, even to the ruin and
rubbish of it; when they have a mighty desire and longing for the
reparation of it, as the Jews in captivity had for the very dust of the
temple; [Psa 102:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#014.md) : "For thy
servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof."
"For" there notes it to be a reason why the set time was judged by them
to be come. That is God's set time when the church is most believing,
most humble, most affectionate to God's interest in it, and most
sincere. Without faith we are not fit to desire mercy, without humility
we are not fit to receive it, without affection we are not fit to value
it, without sincerity we are not fit to improve it. Times of extremity
contribute to the growth and exercise of these qualifications. - Stephen
Charnock.

[Psa 102:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#014.md)

"For thy servants take pleasure in her stones." That is, they are still
attached to her, and regard her with extreme affection, although in
ruins. Jerusalem itself affords at this day a touching illustration of
this passage. There is reason to believe that a considerable portion of
the lower part of the walls which enclose the present mosque of Omar,
which occupies the site of the ancient Jewish temple, are the same, or
at least the southern, western, and eastern sides are the same as those
of Solomon's temple. At one Dart where the remains of this old wall are
the most considerable and of the most massive character - where two
courses of masonry, composed of massive blocks of stone, rising to the
height of thirty feet - is what is called the Wailing Place of the Jews.
"Here," says Dr. Olin, "at the foot of the wall, is an open place paved
with flags, where the Jews assemble every Friday, and in small numbers
on other days, for the purpose of praying and bewailing the desolations
of their holy places. Neither the Jews nor Christians are allowed to
enter the Haram, which is consecrated to Mohammedan worship, and this
part of the wall is the nearest approach they can make to what they
regard as the precise spot within the forbidden enclosure upon which the
ancient temple stood. They keep the pavement swept with great care, and
take off their shoes, as on holy ground. Standing or kneeling with their
faces towards the ancient wall, they gaze in silence upon its venerable
stones, or pour forth their complaints in half-suppressed, though
audible tones. This, to me, was always a most affecting sight, and I
repeated my visit to this interesting spot to enjoy and sympathise with
the melancholy yet pleasing spectacle. The poor people sometimes sobbed
aloud, and still found tears to pour out for the desolations of their
'beautiful house.' 'If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand
forget her cunning. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to
the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.'" -
Kitto's Pictorial Bible.

[Psa 102:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#016.md)

"When the Lord shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory." So
sincere is God to his people, that he gives his own glory in hostage to
them for their security; his own robes of glory are locked up in their
prosperity and salvation: he will not, indeed he cannot, present himself
in all his magnificence and royalty, till he hath made up his intended
thoughts of mercy to his people; he is pleased to prorogue the time of
his appearing in all his glory to the world till he hath actually
accomplished their deliverance, that he and they may come forth together
in their glory on the same day: "When the Lord shall build up Zion, he
shall appear in his glory." The sun is ever glorious in the most cloudy
day, but appears not so till it hath scattered the clouds that muffle it
up from the sight of the lower world: God is glorious when the world
sees him not; but his declarative glory then appears, when the glory of
his mercy, truth and faithfulness break forth in his people's salvation.
Now, what shame must this cover thy face with, O Christian, if thou
shouldst not sincerely aim at thy God's glory, who loves thee, yea, all
his children so dearly, as to ship his own glory and your happiness in
one bottom, that he cannot now lose the one, and save the other! -
William Gurnall.

[Psa 102:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#016.md)

"When the Lord shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory." There
are two reasons why the Lord appears thus glorious in this work rather
than in any other. First, because it is a work that infinitely pleaseth
him. Men choose to appear in their clothes and behaviour suitable to the
work that they are to be employed in: the woman of Tekoah must feign
herself to be a mourner when she goes on a mournful message; and David,
when he goes on a doleful journey, covers his face, and puts on mourning
apparel; but when Solomon is to be crowned, he goes in all his royalty;
and a bride adorns herself gloriously when she is to be married: verily
so doth the Lord, when he goes about a work he takes no pleasure in, he
puts on his mourning apparel, he covers himself with a cloud and the
heavens with blackness; when he is to do a strange work of judgment,
then he mourns, "How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver
thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as
Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled
together." [Hos 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008.md). But the building
of Zion doth infinitely please him, because Zion is as the apple of his
eye to him; he bought Zion at a dear rate, with his own blood; he lays
Zion in his bosom, he is ravished with Zion, Zion is his love, his dove,
his fair one; he hath chosen Zion, and loves the gates of it, better
than all the palaces of Jacob; and being so pleasing to him, no marvel
if he put on all his glorious apparel when he is to adorn and build up
Zion. And, secondly, it is because all the glory that he looks for to
eternity must arise out of this one work of building Zion; this one work
shall be the only monument of his glory to eternity: this goodly world,
this heaven and earth, that you see and enjoy the use of, is set up only
as a shop, as a workshop, to stand only for a week, for six or seven
thousand years, ("a thousand years is with the Lord but as a day"); and
when his work is done he will throw this piece of clay down again, and
out of this he looks for no other glory than from a cabul, a land of
dirt, or a shepherd's cottage, or a gourd which springs up in a night
and withers in a day; but this piece he sets up for a higher end, to be
the eternal mansion of his holiness and honour; this is his metropolis,
his temple, his house where his fire and furnace is, his court, his
glorious high throne, and therefore his glory is much concerned in this
work. When Nebuchadnezzar would have a city for the honour of his
kingdom, and the glory of his majesty, he will make it a stately piece.
Solomon made all his kingdom very rich and glorious, but he made his
court, and especially his throne, another manner of thing, so stately
that the like was not to be seen in any other kingdom; and therefore no
wonder though he appear in his glory in building up of that, which we
may boldly say must be one day made as glorious as his wisdom can
contrive, and his power bring to pass. - Stephen Marshall, in a Sermon
preached to the Right Honourable the House of Peers, entitled "God's
Master-Piece," 1645.

"Shall build - shall appear - will regard - and will not despise." These
futures, in the original, are all present; "buildeth - appeareth -
regardeth - and despiseth not." The Psalmist, in his confidence of the
event, speaks of it as doing. - Samuel Horsley.

[Psa 102:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#017.md)

"He will regard the prayer of the destitute," etc. The persons are here
called "the destitute." The Hebrew word which is here translated
"destitute" doth properly signify myrica, a low shrub, humiles myricae,
low shrubs that grow in wildernesses, some think they were juniper
shrubs, some a kind of wild tamaris, but a base wild shrub that grew
nowhere but in a desolate forlorn place; and sometimes the word in the
text is used to signify the deserts of Arabia, the sandy desert place of
Arabia, which was a miserable wilderness. Now when this word is applied
to men, it always means such as were forsaken men, despised men; such
men as are stripped of all that is comfortable to them; either they
never had children, or else their children are taken away from them, and
all comforts banished, and themselves left utterly forlorn, like the
barren heath in a desolate howling wilderness. These are the people of
whom my text speaks, that the Lord will regard the prayer of "the
destitute;" and this was now the state of the Church of God when they
offered up this prayer, and yet by faith did foretell that God would
grant such a glorious answer....

This is also a lesson of singular comfort to every afflicted soul, to
assure them their prayers and supplications are tenderly regarded before
God. I have often observed such poor forsaken ones, who in their own
eyes are brought very low, that of all other people they are most
desirous to beg and obtain the prayers of their friends, when they see
any that hath gifts, and peace, and cheerfulness of spirit, and liberty,
and abilities to perform duties, O how glad they are to get such a man's
prayers! "I beseech you, will you pray for me, will you please to
remember me at the throne of grace," whereas, in truth, if we could give
a right judgment, all such would rather desire the poor, and the
desolate, to be mediators for them; for, certainly, whomsoever God
neglects, he will listen to the cry of those that are forsaken and
destitute. And therefore, O thou afflicted and tossed with tempests, who
thinkest thou art wholly rejected by the Lord, continue to pour out thy
soul to him; thou hast a faithful promise from him to be rewarded: "he
will regard the prayer of the destitute." - Stephen Marshall, in a
Sermon entitled "The Strong Helper," 1645.

[Psa 102:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#017.md)

"He will regard the prayer of the destitute." It is worthy of
observation that he ascribes the redemption and restoration of the
people to the prayers of the faithful. That is truly a free gift, and
dependent wholly upon the divine mercy, and yet God himself often
attributes it to our prayers, to stir us up and render us the more
active in the pursuit of prayer. - Mollerus.

[Psa 102:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#017.md)

"The prayer of the destitute." A man that is destitute knows how to
pray. He needs not any instructor. His miseries indoctrinate him
wonderfully in the art of offering prayer. Let us know ourselves
destitute, that we may know how to pray; destitute of strength, of
wisdom, of due influence, of true happiness, of proper faith, of
thorough consecration, of the knowledge of the Scriptures, of
righteousness.

These words introduce and stand in immediate connection with a prophecy
of glorious things to be witnessed in the latter times. We profess to be
eager for the accomplishment of those marvellous things; but are we
offering the prayer of the destitute? On the contrary, is not the Church
at large too much like the church at Laodicea? Will not a just
interpretation of many of its acts and ways bring forth the words, "I am
rich and increased in goods, and have need of nothing"? And do not its
prayers meet with this reproachful answer, "Thou art wretched, and
miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked, and knowest it not. Thy
temporal affluence implies not spiritual affluence. Thy spiritual
condition is inversely as the worldly prosperity that has turned thy
head. I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire. Give all thy
trashy gold - trashy while it is with thee - give it to my poor; and I
will give thee true gold - namely, a sense of thy misery and meanness; a
longing for grace, purity, usefulness; a love of thy fellow-men; and my
love shed abroad in thy heart." - George Bowen.

[Psa 102:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#017.md)

"Not despise their prayer." How many in every place (who have served the
Lord in this great work) hath prayer helped at a dead lift? Prayer hath
hitherto saved the kingdom. I remember a proud boast of our enemies,
when we had lost Bristol and the Vies, they then sent abroad even into
other kingdoms a triumphant paper, wherein they concluded all was now
subdued to them, and among many other confident expressions, there was
one to this purpose, Nil restat superare Regem, etc., which might be
construed two ways; either thus, - There remains nothing for the King to
conquer, but only the prayers of a few fanatic people; or thus, - There
is nothing left to conquer the King, but the prayers of a Jew fanatic
people: everything else was lost, all was now their own. And indeed we
were then in a very low condition. Our strongholds taken, our armies
melted away, our hearts generally failing us for fear, multitudes flying
out of the kingdom, and many deserting the cause as desperate, making
their peace at Oxford; nothing almost left us but preces et lachrymae;
but blessed be God, prayer was not conquered; they have found it the
hardest wall to climb, the strongest brigade to overthrow; it hath
hitherto preserved us, it hath raised up unexpected helps, and brought
many unhoped for successes and deliverances. Let us therefore, under
God, set the crown upon the head of prayer. Ye nobles and worthies, be
ye all content to have it so; it will wrong none of you in your deserved
praise; God and man will give you your due. Many of you have done
worthily, but prayer surpasses you all and this is no new thing, prayer
hath always had the pre-eminence in the building of Zion. God hath
reserved several works for several men and several ages; but in all ages
and among all men, prayer hath been the chiefest instrument, especially
in the building up of Zion. - Stephen Marshall.

[Psa 102:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#017.md)

"Not despise their prayer." He will, then, give ear to the suits of the
poor, and not reject their supplications. But who will believe this? Is
it likely, that when God is in his glory, he will attend to such mean
things as hearkening to the poor? Can it stand with the honour of his
glory to stand reading petitions, and specially of men that come in
forma pauperis? scarce credible indeed with men, who, raised in honour,
keep a distance from the poor and count it a degree of falling to look
downwards: but credible enough with God, who counts it his glory to
regard the inglorious; and being the Most High, yet looks as low as to
the lowest, and favours them most who are most despised. And this did
Christ after his transfiguration, when he had appeared in his glory; he
then shewed acts of greatest humility; he then washed the disciples'
feet; and made Peter as much wonder to see his humbleness as he had done
before to see his glory. - Sir R. Baker.

[Psa 102:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#018.md)

"Shall praise the Lord." The people whom God in mercy brings from a low
and mean condition, are the people from whom God promises to receive
praise and glory. Indeed, such is the selfishness of our corrupt nature,
that if we are anything, or do anything, we are prone to forget God, and
sacrifice to our own nets, and burn incense to our own yarn; inasmuch,
that whenever God finds a people who shall either trust in him, or
praise him, it must be "an afflicted and poor people," ([Zep
3:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#011.md); [Psa
22:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#022).md), or a people brought from
such an estate: free grace is even most valued by such a people. And if
you look all the Scripture over, you will find that all the praises and
songs of deliverance that have been made to God have proceeded from a
people that have thus judged of themselves, as those that were brought
to nothing; but God in mercy had brought them back again from the gates
of death, and usually until they had such apprehensions of themselves
they never gave unto God the glory due unto his name. - Stephen
Marshall.

[Psa 102:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#018.md)

Expositors observe upon this text, that this redeemed Church takes no
thought concerning themselves, about their own ease, pleasure, wealth,
gain, or anything else which might accrue unto themselves by this
deliverance, to make their own life easy or sweet; but their thoughts
and studies are wholly laid out, how the present and succeeding
generations should give all glory to God for it....

There are three special reasons why this should be the great work of the
Lord's saved and rescued people, and why indeed they can do no other
than study thus to exalt him.

I. One is, because they well know that the Lord hath reserved nothing to
himself but only his glory; the benefits he gives to them; all the
sweetness and honey that can be found in them he gives them leave to
suck out; but his glory and his praise is his own, and that which he
hath wholly reserved; of that he is jealous, lest it should either be
denied, eclipsed, diminished, or any the least violation offered to it
in any kind. All God's people know this of him, and therefore they
cannot but endeavour to preserve it for him.

II\. Secondly, besides, they know, as God is jealous in that point, so
it is all the work that he hath appointed them to do; he hath therefore
separated them to himself out of all nations of the world, to be his
peculiar ones for this very end, that they might give him all the glory
and praise of his mercy. "I have (said God) created him, formed, and
made him for my glory." [Isa 43:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#007.md).
This is the law of his new creation, which is as powerful in them as the
law of nature, or the first creation, is in the rest of his works. And
therefore with a holy and spiritual naturalness (if I may so call it)
the hearts of all the saints are carried to give God the glory, as
really as the stones are carried to the centre, or the fire to fly
upwards: this is fixed in their hearts, the work of grace hath moulded
them to it, that they can do no other but endeavour to exalt God, it
being the very end why their spiritual life and all their other
privileges are conferred upon them.

III\. Yea, thirdly, they know their own interests are much concerned in
God's glory, they never are losers by it: if in any work of God he want
his praise, they will want their comfort; but if God be a gainer, they
shall certainly be no losers. Whatever is poured upon the head of Christ
- what ointment soever of praise or glory, it will in a due proportion
fall down to the skirts of his garments; nor is there any other way to
have any sweetness, comfort, praise, or glory to be derived unto
themselves, but by giving all unto him, to whom alone it belongeth, and
then although he will never give away his glory - the glory of being the
fountain, the first, supreme, original giver of all good; yet they shall
have the glory of instruments, and of fellow workers with him, which is
a glory and praise sufficient. - Stephen Marshall.

[Psa 102:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#018) (first clause.md)

Calvin translates thus, - "This shall be registered for the generations
to come;" and observes, - "The Psalmist intimates, that this will be a
memorable work of God, the praise of which shall be handed down to
succeeding ages. Many things are worthy of praise, which are soon
forgotten; but the prophet distinguishes between the salvation of the
Church, for which he makes supplication, and common benefits. By the
word register he means that the history of this would be worthy of
having a place in the public records, that the remembrance of it might
be transmitted to future generations."

[Psa 102:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#018.md)

"This shall be written." Nothing is more tenacious than man's memory
when he suffers an injury; nothing more lax if a benefit is conferred.
For this reason God desires lest his gifts should fall out of mind, to
have them committed to writing. - Le Blanc.

[Psa 102:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#020.md)

"To hear the groaning of the prisoner." God takes notice not only of the
prayers of his afflicted people, which are the language of grace; but
even of their groans, which are the language of nature. - Matthew Henry.

[Psa 102:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#020.md)

"Appointed unto death." Who, in their captivity, are experiencing so
much affliction, that it is manifest, their cruel enemies are desirous
of destroying them utterly; or, at least, of bringing them into such a
low and pitiable state, as to blot out their name from among the nations
of the earth. - William Keatinge Clay.

[Psa 102:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#024.md)

"O my God." The leaving out one word in a will may mar the estate and
disappoint all a man's hopes; the want of this one word, my (God,) is
the wicked man's loss of heaven, and the dagger which will pierce his
heart in hell to all eternity.

The degree of satisfaction in any good is according to the degree of our
union to it, (hence our delight is greater in food than in clothes, and
the saint's joy is greater in God in the other world than in this,
because the union is nearer): but where there is no property there is no
union, therefore no complacency. The pronoun, my is as much worth to the
soul as the boundless portion. All our comfort is locked up in that
private cabinet. Wine in the glass doth not cheer the heart, but taken
down into the body. The property of the Psalmist's in God was the mouth
whereby he fed on those dainties which did so exceedingly delight him.
No love potion was ever so effectual as this pronoun. When God saith to
the soul, as Ahab to Benhadad "Behold, I am thine, and all that I have,"
who can tell how the heart leaps for joy in, and expires almost in
desires after him upon such news! drivers, like strangers, may behold
his honour and excellencies, but this saint only, like the wife,
enjoyeth him. Luther saith, Much religion lieth in pronouns. All our
consolation, indeed, consisteth in this pronoun. It is the cup which
holdeth all our cordial waters. I will undertake as bad as the devil is,
he shall give the whole world, were it in his power, more freely than
ever he offered it to Christ for his worship, for leave from God to
pronounce those two words, My God. All the joys of the believer are hung
upon this one string; break that asunder, and all is lost. I have
sometimes thought how David rolls it as a lump of sugar under his
tongue, as one loth to lose its sweetness too soon: "I will love thee, O
Lord, my strength, my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high
tower," [Psa 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#001.md), [Psa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002.md). This pronoun is the door at
which the King of saints entereth into our hearts, with his whole train
of delights and comforts. - George Swinnock.

[Psa 102:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#024.md)

"Take me not away," is more exactly, Take me not up, with possible
reference to the case of Elijah, "taken up." - Henry Cowles.

[Psa 102:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#024.md)

"Take me not away in the midst of my days." The word is, "Let me not
ascend in the midst of my days," that is, before I have measured the
usual course of life. Thus, to ascend is the same as to be cut off;
death cuts off the best from this world, and then they ascend to a
better. The word ascend is conceived to have in it a double allusion;
first, to corn which is taken up by the hand of the reaper, and then
laid down on the stubble. Secondly, unto the light of a candle, which as
the candle spends, or as that which is the food of the fire is spending,
ascends, and at last goes out and vanisheth. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 102:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#024.md)

"Thy years are throughout all generations." The Psalmist says of Christ,
"Thy years are throughout all generations," [Psa
102:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#024.md); which Psalm the apostle
quoteth of him, [Heb 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#010.md). Let us
trace his existence punctually through all times. Let us go from point
to point, and see how in particulars the Scriptures accord with it. The
first point of time we will begin that chronology of his existence
withal is that instant afore he was to come into the world.

First, We find him to have existed just afore he came into the world,
the instance of his conception, [Heb
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005.md), in these words, "Wherefore when
he comes into the world, says he, A body hast thou prepared me." [Heb
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#007.md), "Lo, I come to do thy will, O
God." Here is a person distinct from God the Father, a me, an I,
distinct also from that human nature he was to assume, which he terms a
"body prepared."... Therefore besides and afore that human nature there
was a divine person that existed, that was not of this world, but that
came into it, "when he cometh into the world, he says," etc., to become
a part of it, and be manifested in it.

Secondly, We find him to have existed afore John the Baptist, though
John was conceived and born some months afore him. I note these several
joints of time because the Scripture notes them, and hath set a special
mark upon them: [Joh 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#015.md). "John bare
witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that
cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me." This
priority of existence is that which John doth specially give witness to.
And it is priority in existence, for he allegeth it as a reason why he
was preferred afore him; "for he was before me."

Thirdly, We find him existing when all the prophets wrote and spake,
[Pe1 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#011.md). The Spirit of Christ is
said to have been in all the prophets, even as Paul, who came after
Christ, also speaks, "You seek a proof of Christ speaking in me," [Co2
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#003.md). And therefore he himself, whose
Spirit it was, or whom he sent, must needs exist as a person sending
him.

Fourthly, We find him existing in Moses' time, both because it was he
that was tempted in the wilderness, "Neither let us tempt Christ as some
of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents," [Co1
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#009.md); and it was Christ that was the
person said to be tempted by them, as well as now by us, as the word καῖ
"as they also," evidently shows. And it points to that angel that was
sent with them, [Exo 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020.md), [Exo
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#021.md), in whom the name of God was,
and who as God had the power of pardoning sins, [Exo
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#021.md). See also [Act
7:35](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#035.md), [Heb
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#026.md).

Fifthly, We find him existing in and afore Abraham's time: "Verily,
verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am," [Joh
8:58](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#058.md).

Sixthly, We find him existing in the days of Noah, [Pe1
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#019.md). He says of Christ, that he was
"put to death in the flesh, but quickened in the Spirit." He evidently
distinguisheth of two natures, his divine and human, even as from. [Pe1
1:3, 60 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003.md) and elsewhere; and then
declares how by that divine nature, which he terms "Spirit," in which he
was existent in Noah's times, he went and preached to those of the old
world, whose souls are now in prison in hell. These words, "in Spirit,"
are not put to signify the subject of vivification; for such neither his
soul nor Godhead could be said to be, for that is not quickened which
was not dead; but for the principal and cause of his vivification, which
his soul was not, but his Godhead was. And besides by his Spirit is not
meant his soul, for that then must be supposed to have preached to souls
in hell (where these are affirmed to be). Now, there is no preaching
where there is no capacity of faith. But his meaning is, that those
persons that lived in Noah's time, and were preached unto, their souls
and spirits were now, when this was written, spirits in prison, that is,
in hell. And therefore he also adds this word "sometimes": "who were
sometimes disobedient in Noah's days." These words give us to understand
that this preaching was performed by Noah ministerially, yet by Christ
in Noah; who according to his divine person was extant, and went with
him, as with Moses, and the church in the wilderness, and preached unto
them.

Seventhly, He was extant at the beginning of the world, "In the
beginning was the Word." In which words, there being no predicate or
attribute affirmed of this word, the sentence or affirmation is
terminated or ended merely with his existence: "he was," and he was
then, "in the beginning." He says not that he was made in the beginning,
but that "he was in the beginning." And it is in the beginning
absolutely, without any limitation. And therefore Moses's beginning,
[Gen 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md), is meant, as also the words
after show, "All was made by him that was made;" and, [Psa
102:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#010.md), the world he came into was
made by him. And as from the beginning is usually taken from the first
times or infancy of the world; so then, when God began to create, then
was our Christ. And this here is set in opposition ([Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014).md) unto the time of his being made
flesh, lest that should have been thought his beginning. And unto this
accords that of [Heb 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#010.md), where,
speaking of Christ, out of Psalm 102, "Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast
laid the foundations of the earth;" so as to be sure he existed then.
But further, in [Psa 102:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#024.md), it runs
thus, "Thy years are throughout all generations." We have run, you see,
through all generations since the creation, and have found his years
throughout them all. And yet lest that should be taken only of the
generations of this world, he adds (as Rivet expounds it), "Before thou
laidst the foundation of the earth."

Eighthly, So then we come to this, that he hath been before the
creation, yea, from everlasting.

But, Ninthly, If you would have his eternity yet more express, see [Heb
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#003.md), where mentioning Melchisedec,
Christ's type, he renders him to have been his type in this - "Without
father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of
days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a
priest continually." Where his meaning is to declare that, look what
Melchisedec was typic, or umbraiter, in a shadow, that our Christ was
really and substantially.

Lastly, Add to this that in [Mic 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002.md),
"But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands
of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be
ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from
everlasting;" where he evidently speaks of two births Christ had, under
the metaphor of going forth: one as man at Bethlehem in the fulness of
time, the other as Son of God from everlasting. As Son of God, his
goings forth (that is, his birth) are from everlasting. And it is
termed, "goings forth," in the plural; because it is actus continuus,
and hath been every moment continued from everlasting. As the sun begets
light and beams every moment, so God doth his Son. So then we have two
everlastings attributed to Christ's person; one to come, [Heb
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#010.md), and another past, here in [Mic
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002.md). And so as of God himself it is
said, [Psa 90:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#002.md), "From everlasting to
everlasting thou art God," so also of Christ. - Condensed from T.
Goodwin's Treatise on "The Knowledge of God the Father, and his Son
Jesus Christ."

[Psa 102:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#025.md)

"Earth." "Heavens." He names here the most stable parts of the world,
and the most beautiful parts of the creation, those that are freest from
corruptibility and change, to illustrate thereby the immutability of
God, that though the heavens and earth have a prerogative of fixedness
above other parts of the world, and the creatures that reside below, the
heavens remain the same as they were created, and the centre of the
earth retains its fixedness, and are as beautiful and fresh in their age
as they were in their youth many years ago, notwithstanding the change
of the elements, fire and water being often turned into air, so that
there may remain but little of that air which was first created, by
reason of the continual transmutation; yet this firmness of the earth
and heavens is not to be regarded in comparison of the unmoveableness
and fixedness of the being of God. As their beauty comes short of the
glory of his being, so doth their firmness come short of his stability.
- Stephen Charnock.

[Psa 102:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#026.md)

"They shall perish." The greater the corruption, the raster the
destruction. Some think that the fiery deluge shall ascend no higher
than did the watery. It may be the earth shall be burned, that is the
worst guest at the table, the common sewer of all other creatures, but
shall the heavens pass away? It may be the airy heaven; but shall the
starry heaven where God hath printed such figures of his glory? Yes,
caelum, elementum, terra, when ignis ubique ferox ruptis regnabit
habenis. The former deluge is called the world's winter, the next the
world's summer. The one was with a cold and moist element, the other
shall be with an element hot and dry. But what then shall become of the
saints? They shall be delivered out of all; walking like those three
servants in the midst of that great furnace, the burning world, and not
be scorched, because there is one among them to deliver them, "the Son
of God," [Dan 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#025.md), their Redeemer.
But shall all quite perish? No, there is rather a mutation than an
abolition of their substance. "Thou shalt change them, and they shall be
changed," not abolished. The concupiscence shall pass, not the essence;
the form, not the nature. In the altering of an old garment, we destroy
it not, but trim it, refresh it, and make it seem new. They pass, they
do not perish; the dross is purged, the metal stays. The corrupt quality
shall be renewed, and all things restored to that original beauty
wherein they were created. "The end of all things is at hand," [Pe1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#007.md) : an end of us, an end of our
days, an end of our ways, an end of our thoughts. If a man could say as
Job's messenger, I alone am escaped, it were somewhat; or might find an
ark with Noah. But there is no ark to defend them from that heat, but
only the bosom of Jesus Christ. - Thomas Adams.

[Psa 102:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#026.md)

"Like a garment." The whole creation is as a garment, wherein the Lord
shows his power clothed unto men; whence in particular he is said to
clothe himself with light as with a garment. And in it is the hiding of
his power. Hid it is, as a man is hid with a garment; not that he should
not be seen at all, but that he should not be seen perfectly and as he
is. It shows the man, and he is known by it; but also it hides him, that
he is not perfectly or fully seen. So are the works of creation unto
God, he so far makes them his garment or clothing as in them to give out
some instances of his power and wisdom; but he is also hid in them, in
that by them no creature can come to the full and perfect knowledge of
him. Now, when this work shall cease, and God shall unclothe or unveil
all his glory to his saints, and they shall know him perfectly, see him
as he is, so far as a created nature is capable of that comprehension,
then will he lay them aside and fold them up, at least as to that use,
as easily as a man lays aside a garment that he will wear or use no
more. This lies in the metaphor. - John Owen.

[Psa 102:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#027.md)

"Thou art the same." The essence of God, with all the perfections of his
nature, are pronounced the same, without any variation from eternity to
eternity. So that the text doth not only assert the eternal duration of
God, but his immutability in that duration; his eternity is signified in
that expression, "thou shalt endure;" his immutability in this, "thou
art the same." To endure, argues indeed this immutability as well as
eternity; for what endures is not changed, and what is changed doth not
endure. "But thou art the same," אתּח חוּא, doth more fully signify it.
He could not be the same if he could be changed into any other thing
than what he is. The Psalmist therefore puts, not thou hast been or
shall be, but thou art the same, without any alteration; thou art the
same, that is, the same God, the same in essence and nature, the same in
will and purpose, thou dost change all other things as thou pleaseth;
but thou art immutable in every respect, and receivest no shadow of
change, though never so light and small. The Psalmist here alludes to
the name Jehovah, I am, and doth not only ascribe immutability to God,
but exclude everything else from partaking in that perfection. - Stephen
Charnock.

[Psa 102:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#028.md)

"The children of thy servants shall continue." In what sense is
"children" taken? Either the children of their flesh, or of their faith.
Some say the children of the same faith with the godly teachers and
servants of the Lord, begotten by them to God, as noting the perpetuity
of the church, who shall in every age bring forth children to God. 'Tis
the comfort of God's people to see a young brood growing up to continue
his remembrance in the world, that when they die religion shall not die
with them, nor the succession of the church be interrupted. This sense
is not altogether incongruous; but rather I think the children of their
body are here intended; it being a blessing often promised; see the next
Psalm, [Psa 102:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#017.md). "The mercy of the
Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his
righteousness unto children's children," "Shall continue;" "shall be
established." In what sense is it spoken? Some think only pro more
faederis, according to the fashion of that covenant which the people of
God were then under, when eternity was but more darkly revealed and
shadowed out, either by long life, or the continuance of their name in
their posterity, which was a kind of literal immortality. Clearly such a
kind of regard is had, as appeareth by that which you find in [Psa
37:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#028.md). "The Lord loveth judgment, and
forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever." How? since they
die as others do; mark the antithesis, and that will explain it. "They
are preserved for ever; but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off."
They are preserved in their posterity. Children are but the parents
multiplied, and the parent continued; 'tis nodosa eternitas; when the
father's life is run out to the last, there is a knot tied, and the line
is still continued by the child. I confess, temporal blessings, such as
long life, and the promise of a happy posterity, are more visible in the
eye of that dispensation of the covenant; but yet God still taketh care
for the children of his people, and many promises run that way that
belong to the gospel-administration, and still God's service is the
surest way to establish a family, as sin is the ready way to root it
out. And if it doth not always fall out accordingly, yet for the most
part it doth; and we are no competent judges of God's dispensations in
this kind, because we see Providence by pieces, and have not the skill
to set them together; but at the day of judgment, when the whole
contexture of God's dealings is laid before us, we shall clearly
understand how the children of his servants continue, and their seed is
established. - Thomas Manton.

[Psa 102:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#028.md)

O the folly of the world, that seeks to make perpetuities to their
houses by devises in the law, which may perhaps reach to continue their
estates, but can it reach to continue their seed? It may entail lands to
their heirs, but can it entail heirs to their lands? No, God knows! This
is a perpetuity of only God's making, a privilege of only God's servants
for "The children of his servants shall continue, and their seed shall
be established before him;" but that any others shall continue is no
part of David's warrant. - Sir R. Baker.

[Psalms 102:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 102:1</span></span>

1 Hear my prayer, O Lord, and let my cry come unto thee.

2 Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble; incline
thine ear unto me; in the day when I call answer me speedily.

3 For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an
hearth.

4 My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat
my bread.

5 By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin.

6 I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.

7 I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.

8 Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad against me
are sworn against me.

9 For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping.

10 Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me
up, and cast me down.

11 My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like
grass.

[Psa 102:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#001.md)

"Hear my prayer, O Lord." Or O Jehovah. Sincere suppliants are not
content with praying for praying's sake, they desire really to reach the
ear and heart of the great God. It is a great relief in time of distress
to acquaint others with our trouble, we are eased by their hearing our
lamentations, but it is the sweetest solace of all to have God himself
as a sympathizing listener to our plaint. That he is such is no dream or
fiction, but an assured fact. It would be the direst of all our woes if
we could be indisputably convinced that with God there is neither
hearing nor answering; he who could argue us into so dreary a belief
would do us no better service than if he had read us our death-warrants.
Better die than be denied the mercy-seat. As well be atheists at once as
believe in an unhearing, unfeeling God. "And let my cry come unto thee."
When sorrow rises to such a height that words become too weak a medium
of expression, and prayer is intensified into a cry, then the heart is
even more urgent to have audience with the Lord. If our cries do not
enter within the veil, and reach to the living God, we may as well cease
from prayer at once, for it is idle to cry to the winds; but, blessed be
God, the philosophy which suggests such a hideous idea is disproved by
the facts of everyday experience, since thousands of the saints can
declare, "Verily, God hath heard us."

[Psa 102:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#002.md)

"Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble." Do not seem
as if thou didst not see me, or wouldst not own me. Smile now at any
rate. Reserve thy frowns for other times when I can bear them better,
if, indeed, I can ever bear them; but now in my heavy distress, favour
me with looks of compassion. "Incline thine ear unto me." Bow thy
greatness to my weakness. If because of sin thy face is turned away, at
least let me have a side view of thee, lend me thine ear if I may not
see thine eye. Turn thyself to me again if my sin has turned thee away,
give to thine ear an inclination to my prayers. "In the day when I call
answer me speedily." Because the case is urgent, and my soul little able
to wait. We may ask to have answers to prayer as soon as possible, but
we may not complain of the Lord if he should think it more wise to
delay. We have permission to request and to use importunity, but no
right to dictate or to be petulant. If it be important that the
deliverance should arrive at once, we are quite right in making an early
time a point of our entreaty, for God is as willing to grant us a favour
now as to-morrow, and he is not slack concerning his promise. It is a
proverb concerning favours from human hands, that "he gives twice who
gives quickly," because a gift is enhanced in value by arriving in a
time of urgent necessity; and we may be sure that our heavenly Patron
will grant us the best gifts in the best manner, granting us grace to
help in time of need. When answers come upon the heels of our prayers
they are all the more striking, more consoling, and more encouraging.

In [Psa 102:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#001.md) the Psalmist has
gathered up a variety of expressions all to the same effect; in them all
he entreats an audience and answer of the Lord, and the whole may be
regarded as a sort of preface to the prayer which follows.

[Psa 102:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#003.md)

"For my days are consumed like smoke." My grief has made life
unsubstantial to me, I seem to be but a puff of vapour which has nothing
in it, and is soon dissipated. The metaphor is very admirably chosen,
for, to the unhappy, life seems not merely to be frail, but to be
surrounded by so much that is darkening, defiling, blinding, and
depressing, that, sitting down in despair, they compare themselves to
men wandering in a dense fog, and themselves so dried up thereby that
they are little better than pillars of smoke. When our days have neither
light of joy nor fire of energy in them, but become as a smoking flax
which dies out ignobly in darkness, then have we cause enough to appeal
to the Lord that he would not utterly quench us. "And my bones are
burned as an hearth." He became as dry as the hearth on which a wood
fire has burned out, or as spent ashes in which scarcely a trace of fire
can be found. His soul was ready to be blown away as smoke, and his body
seemed likely to remain as the bare hearth when the last comforting
ember is quenched. How often has our piety appeared to us to be in this
condition! We have had to question its reality, and fear that it never
was anything more than a smoke; we have had the most convincing evidence
of its weakness, for we could not derive even the smallest comfort from
it, any more than a chilled traveller can derive from the cold hearth on
which a fire had burned long ago. Soul-trouble experienced in our own
heart will help us to interpret the language here employed; and
church-troubles may help us also, if unhappily we have been called to
endure them. The Psalmist was moved to grief by a view of national
calamities, and these so wrought upon his patriotic soul that he was
wasted with anxiety, his spirits were dried up, and his very life was
ready to expire. There is hope for any country which owns such a son; no
nation can die while true hearts are ready to die for it.

[Psa 102:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#004.md)

"My heart is smitten," like a plant parched by the fierce heat of a
tropical sun, "and withered like grass," which dries up when once the
scythe has laid it low. The Psalmist's heart was as a wilted, withered
flower, a burned up mass of what once was verdure. His energy, beauty,
freshness, and joy, were utterly gone, through the wasting influence of
his anguish. "So that I forget to eat my bread," or "because I forget to
eat my bread." Grief often destroys the appetite, and the neglect of
food tends further to injure the constitution and create a yet deeper
sinking of spirit. As the smitten flower no longer drinks in the dew, or
draws up nutriment from the soft, so a heart parched with intense grief
often refuses consolation for itself and nourishment for the bodily
frame, and descends at a doubly rapid rate into weakness, despondency,
and dismay. The case here described is by no means rare, we have
frequently met with individuals so disordered by sorrow that their
memory has failed them even upon such pressing matters as their meals,
and we must confess that we have passed through the same condition
ourselves. One sharp pang has filled the soul, monopolized the mind, and
driven everything else into the background, so that such common matters
as eating and drinking have been utterly despised, and the appointed
hours of refreshment have gone by unheeded, leaving no manifest
faintness of body, but an increased weariness of heart.

[Psa 102:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#005.md)

"By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin." He
became emaciated with sorrow. He had groaned himself down to a living
skeleton, and so in his bodily appearance was the more like the
smoke-dried, withered, burnt-up things to which he had previously
compared himself. It will be a very long time before the distresses of
the church of God make some Christians shrivel into anatomies, but this
good man was so moved with sympathy for Zion's ills that he was wasted
down to skin and bone.

[Psa 102:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#006.md)

"I am like a pelican of the wilderness," a mournful and even hideous
object, the very image of desolation. "I am like an owl of the desert;"
loving solitude, moping among ruins, hooting discordantly. The Psalmist
likens himself to two birds which were commonly used as emblems of gloom
and wretchedness; on other occasions he had been as the eagle, but the
griefs of his people had pulled him down, the brightness was gone from
his eye, and the beauty from his person; he seemed to himself to be as a
melancholy bird sitting among the fallen palaces and prostrate temples
of his native land. Should not we also lament when the ways of Zion
mourn and her strength languishes? Were there more of this holy sorrow
we should soon see the Lord returning to build up his church. It is ill
for men to be playing the peacock with worldly pride when the ills of
the times should make them as mournful as the pelican; and it is a
terrible thing to see men flocking like vultures to devour the prey of a
decaying church, when they ought rather to be lamenting among her ruins
like the owl.

[Psa 102:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#007.md)

"I watch, and am like a sparrow alone upon the house top" I keep a
solitary vigil as the lone sentry of my nation; my fellows are too
selfish, too careless to care for the beloved land, and so like a bird
which sits alone on the house top, I keep up a sad watch over my
country. The Psalmist compared himself to a bird, - a bird when it has
lost its mate or its young, or is for some other reason made to mope
alone in a solitary place. Probably he did not refer to the cheerful
sparrow of our own land, but if he did, the illustration would not be
out of place, for the sparrow is happy in company, and if it were alone,
the sole one of its species in the neighbourhood, there can be little
doubt that it would become very miserable, and sit and pine away. He who
has felt himself to be so weak and inconsiderable as to have no more
power over his times than a sparrow over a city, has also, when bowed
down with despondency concerning the evils of the age, sat himself down
in utter wretchedness to lament the ills which he could not heal.
Christians of an earnest watchful kind often find themselves among those
who have no sympathy with them; even in the church they look in vain for
kindred spirits; then do they persevere in their prayers and labours,
but feel themselves to be as lonely as the poor bird which looks from
the ridge of the roof, and meets with no friendly greeting from any of
its kind.

[Psa 102:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#008.md)

"Mine enemies reproach me all the day.". Their rage was unrelenting and
unceasing, and vented itself in taunts and insults, the Psalmist's
patriotism and his griefs were both made the subjects of their sport.
Pointing to the sad estate of his people they would ask him, "Where is
your God?" and exult over him because their false gods were in the
ascendant. Reproach cuts like a razor, and when it is continued from
hour to hour, and repeated all the day and every day, it makes life
itself undesirable. "And they that are mad against me are sworn against
me." They were so furious that they bound themselves by oath to destroy
him, and used his name as their usual execration, a word to curse by,
the synonym of abhorrence and contempt. What with inward sorrows and
outward persecutions he was in as ill a plight as may well be conceived.

[Psa 102:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#009.md)

"For I have eaten ashes like bread." He had so frequently cast ashes
upon his head in token of mourning, that they had mixed with his
ordinary food, and grated between his teeth when he ate his daily bread.
One while he forgot to eat, and then the fit changed, and he ate with
such a hunger that even ashes were devoured. Grief has strange moods and
tenses. "And mingled my drink with weeping." His drink became as
nauseous as his meat, for copious showers of tears had made it brackish.
This is a telling description of all-saturating, all-embittering
sadness, - and this was the portion of one of the best of men, and that
for no fault of his own, but because of his love to the Lord's people.
If we, too, are called to mourn, let us not be amazed by the fiery trial
as though some strange thing had happened unto us. Both in meat and
drink we have sinned; it is not therefore wonderful if in both we are
made to mourn.

[Psa 102:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#010.md)

"Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up
and cast me down." A sense of the divine wrath which had been manifested
in the overthrow of the chosen nation and their sad captivity led the
Psalmist into the greatest distress. He felt like a sere leaf caught up
by a hurricane and carried right away, or the spray of the sea which is
dashed upwards that it may be scattered and dissolved. Our translation
gives the idea of a vessel uplifted in order that it may be dashed to
the earth with all the greater violence and the more completely broken
in pieces; or to change the figure, it reminds us of a wrestler whom his
opponent catches up that he may give him a more desperate fall. The
first interpretation which we have given is, however, more fully in
accordance with the original, and sets forth the utter helplessness
which the writer felt, and the sense of overpowering terror which bore
him along in a rush of tumultuous grief which he could not with-stand.

[Psa 102:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#011.md)

"My days are like a shadow that declineth." His days were but a shadow
at best, but now they seem to be like a shadow which was passing away. A
shadow is unsubstantial enough, how feeble a thing must a declining
shadow be? No expression could more forcibly set forth his extreme
feebleness. "And I am withered like grass." He was like grass, blasted
by a parching wind, or cut down with a scythe, and then left to be dried
up by the burning heat of the sun. There are times when through
depression of spirit a man feels as if all life were gone from him, and
existence had become merely a breathing death. Heart-break has a
marvellously withering influence over our entire system; our flesh at
its best is but as grass, and when it is wounded with sharp sorrows, its
beauty fades, and it becomes a shrivelled, dried, uncomely thing.

[Psalms 102:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 102:12</span></span>

12 But thou, O Lord, shalt endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all
generations.

13 Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion, for the time to favour
her, yea, the set time, is come.

14 For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust
thereof.

15 So the heathen shall fear the name of the Lord, and all the kings of
the earth thy glory.

16 When the Lord shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.

17 He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their
prayer.

18 This shall be written for the generation to come; and the people
which shall be created shall praise the Lord.

19 For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven
did the Lord behold the earth;

20 To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are
appointed to death;

21 To declare the name of the Lord in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem;

22 When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the
Lord.

23 He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.

24 I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days; thy years
are throughout all generations.

25 Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens
are the work of thy hands.

26 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure; yea, all of them shall wax
old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall
be changed:

27 But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.

28 The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be
established before thee.

[Psa 102:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#012.md)

Now the writer's mind is turned away from his personal and relative
troubles to the true source of all consolation, namely, the Lord
himself, and his gracious purposes towards his own people. "But thou, O
Lord, shalt endure for ever." I perish, but thou wilt not, my nation has
become almost extinct, but thou art altogether unchanged. The original
has the word "sit," - "thou, Jehovah, to eternity shalt sit:" that is to
say, thou reignest on, thy throne is still secure even when thy chosen
city lies in ruins, and thy peculiar people are carried into captivity.
The sovereignty of God in all things is an unfailing ground for
consolation; he rules and reigns whatever happens, and therefore all is
well.

Firm as his throne his promise stands,

And he can well secure,

What I've committed to his hands,

Till the decisive hour.

"And thy remembrance unto all generations." Men will forget me, but as
for thee, O God, the constant tokens of thy presence will keep the race
of man in mind of thee from age to age. What God is now he always will
be, that which our forefathers told us of the Lord we find to be true at
this present time, and what our experience enables us to record will be
confirmed by our children and their children's children. All things else
are vanishing like smoke, and withering like grass, but over all the one
eternal, immutable light shines on, and will shine on when all these
shadows have declined into nothingness.

[Psa 102:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013.md)

"Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion." He firmly believed and
boldly prophesied that apparent inaction on God's part would turn to
effective working. Others might remain sluggish in the matter, but the
Lord would most surely bestir himself. Zion had been chosen of old,
highly favoured, gloriously inhabited, and wondrously preserved, and
therefore by the memory of her past mercies it was certain that mercy
would again be showed to her, God will not always leave his church in a
low condition; he may for a while hide himself from her in chastisement,
to make her see her nakedness and poverty apart from himself, but in
love he must return to her, and stand up in her defence, to work her
welfare. "For the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come."
Divine decree has appointed a season for blessing the church, and when
that period has arrived, blessed she shall be. There was an appointed
time for the Jews in Babylon, and when the weeks were fulfilled, no
bolts nor bars could longer imprison the ransomed of the Lord. When the
time came for the walls to rise stone by stone, no Tobiah or Sanballat
could stay the work, for the Lord himself had arisen, and who can
restrain the hand of the Almighty? When God's own time is come, neither
Rome, nor the devil, nor persecutors, nor atheists, can prevent the
kingdom of Christ from extending its bounds. It is God's work to do it,
- he must "arise"; he will do it, but he has his own appointed season;
and meanwhile we must, with holy anxiety and believing expectation wait
upon him.

[Psa 102:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#014.md)

"For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust
thereof." They delight in her so greatly that even her rubbish is dear
to them. It was a good omen for Jerusalem when the captives began to
feel a home-sickness, and began to sigh after her. We may expect the
modern Jews to be restored to their own land when the love of their
country begins to sway them, and casts out the love of gain. To the
church of God no token can be more full of hope than to see the members
thereof deeply interested in all that concerns her; no prosperity is
likely to rest upon a church when carelessness about ordinances,
enterprises, and services is manifest; but when even the least and
lowest matter connected with the Lord's work is carefully attended to,
we may be sure that the set time to favour Zion is come. The poorest
church member, the most grievous backslider, the most ignorant convert,
should be precious in our sight, because forming a part, although
possibly a very feeble part, of the new Jerusalem. If we do not care
about the prosperity of the church to which we belong, need we wonder if
the blessing of the Lord is withheld?

[Psa 102:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#015.md)

"So the heathen shall fear the name of the Lord." Mercy within the
church is soon perceived by those without. When a candle is lit in the
house, it shines through the window. When Zion rejoices in her God, the
heathen begin to reverence his name, for they hear of the wonders of his
power, and are impressed thereby. "And all the kings of the earth thy
glory." The restoration of Jerusalem was a marvel among the princes who
heard of it, and its ultimate resurrection in days yet to come will be
one of the prodigies of history. A church quickened by divine power is
so striking an object in current history that it cannot escape notice,
rulers cannot ignore it, it affects the Legislature, and forces from the
great ones of the earth a recognition of the divine working. Oh that we
might see in our day such a revival of religion that our senators and
princes might be compelled to pay homage to the Lord, and own his
glorious grace. This cannot be till the saints are better edified, and
more fully builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.
Internal prosperity is the true source of the church's external
influence.

[Psa 102:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#016.md)

"When the Lord shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory." As
kings display their skill and power and wealth in the erection of their
capitals, so would the Lord reveal the splendour of his attributes in
the restoration of Zion, and so will he now glorify himself in the
edification of his church. Never is the Lord more honourable in the eyes
of his saints than when he prospers the church. To add converts to her,
to train these for holy service, to instruct, illuminate, and sanctify
the brotherhood, to bind all together in the bonds of Christian love,
and to fill the whole body with the energy of the Holy Spirit - this is
to build up Zion. Other builders do but puff her up, and their wood,
hay, and stubble come to an end almost as rapidly as it was heaped
together; but what the Lord builds is surely and well done, and redounds
to his glory. Truly, when we see the church in a low state, and mark the
folly, helplessness, and indifference of those who profess to be her
builders; and, on the other hand, the energy, craft, and influence of
those opposed to her, we are fully prepared to own that it will be a
glorious work of omnipotent grace should she ever rise to her pristine
grandeur and purity.

[Psa 102:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#017.md)

"He will regard the prayer of the destitute." Only the poorest of the
people were left to sigh and cry among the ruins of the beloved city; as
for the rest, they were strangers in a strange land, and far away from
the holy place, yet the prayers of the captives and the forlorn
offscourings of the land would be heard of the Lord, who does not hear
men because of the amount of money they possess, or the breadth of the
acres which they call their own, but in mercy listens most readily to
the cry of the greatest need. "And not despise their prayer." When great
kings are building their palaces it is not reasonable to expect them to
turn aside and listen to every beggar who pleads with them, yet when the
Lord builds up Zion, and appears in his robes of glory, he makes a point
of listening to every petition of the poor and needy. He will not treat
their pleas with contempt; he will incline his ear to hear, his heart to
consider, and his hand to help. What comfort is here for those who
account themselves to be utterly destitute; their abject want is here
met with a most condescending promise. It is worth while to be destitute
to be thus assured of the divine regard.

[Psa 102:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#018.md)

"This shall be written for the generation to come." A note shall be made
of it, for there will be destitute ones in future generations, - "the
poor shall never cease out of the land," - and it will make glad their
eyes to read the story of the Lord's mercy to the needy in former times.
Registers of divine kindness ought to be made and preserved: we write
down in history the calamities of nations, - wars, famines, pestilences,
and earthquakes are recorded; how much rather then should we set up
memorials of the Lord's lovingkindnesses! Those who have in their own
souls endured spiritual destitution, and have been delivered out of it,
cannot forget it; they are bound to tell others of it, and especially to
instruct their children in the goodness of the Lord. "And the people
which shall be created shall praise the Lord." The Psalmist here intends
to say that the rebuilding of Jerusalem would be a fact in history for
which the Lord would be praised from age to age. Revivals of religion
not only cause great joy to those who are immediately concerned in them,
but they give encouragement and delight to the people of God long after,
and are indeed perpetual incentives to adoration throughout the church
of God. This verse teaches us that we ought to have an eye to posterity,
and especially should we endeavour to perpetuate the memory of God's
love to his church and to his poor people, so that young people as they
grow up may know that the Lord God of their fathers is good and full of
compassion. Sad as the Psalmist was when he wrote the dreary portions of
this complaint, he was not so absorbed in his own sorrow, or so
distracted by the national calamity, as to forget the claims of coming
generations; this, indeed, is a clear proof that he was not without hope
for his people, for he who is making arrangements for the good of a
future generation has not yet despaired of his nation. The praise of God
should be the great object of all that we do, and to secure him a
revenue of glory both from the present and the future is the noblest aim
of intelligent beings.

[Psa 102:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#019.md), [Psa
102:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#020.md)

"For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary," or "leaned
from the high place of his holiness, from heaven did the Lord behold the
earth," looking out like a watcher from his tower. What was the object
of this leaning from the battlements of heaven? Why this intent gaze
upon the race of men? The answer is full of astounding mercy; the Lord
does not look upon mankind to note their grandees, and observe the
doings of their nobles, but "to hear the groaning of the prisoner; to
loose those that are appointed to death." Now the groans of those in
prison so far from being musical are very horrible to hear, yet God
bends to hear them: those who are bound for death are usually ill
company, yet Jehovah deigns to stoop from his greatness to relieve their
extreme distress and break their chains. This he does by providential
rescues, by restoring health to the dying, and by finding food for the
famishing; and spiritually this need of grace is accomplished by
sovereign grace, which delivers us by pardon from the sentence of sin,
and by the sweetness of the promise from the deadly despair which a
sense of sin had created within us. Well may those of us praise the Lord
who were once the children of death, but are now brought into the
glorious liberty of the children of God. The Jews in captivity were in
Haman's time appointed to death, but their God found a way of escape for
them, and they joyfully kept the feast of Purim in memorial thereof; let
all souls that have been set free from the crafty malice of the old
dragon with even greater gratitude magnify the Lord of infinite
compassion.

[Psa 102:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#021.md)

"To declare the name of the Lord in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem."
Great mercy displayed to those greatly in need of it, is the plainest
method of revealing the attributes of the Most High. Actions speak more
loudly than words; deeds of grace are a revelation even more impressive
than the most tender promises. Jerusalem restored, the church
re-edified, desponding souls encouraged, and all other manifestations of
Jehovah's power to bless, are so many manifestoes and proclamations put
up upon the walls of Zion to publish the character and glory of the
great God. Every day's experience should be to us a new gazette of love,
a court circular from heaven, a daily despatch from the headquarters of
grace. We are bound to inform our fellow Christians of all this, making
them helpers in our praise, as they hear of the goodness which we have
experienced. While God's mercies speak so eloquently, we ought not to be
dumb. To communicate to others what God has done for us personally and
for the church at large is so evidently our duty, that we ought not to
need urging to fulfil it. God has ever an eye to the glory of his grace
in all that he does, and we ought not wilfully to defraud him of the
revenue of his praise.

[Psa 102:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#022.md)

"When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the
Lord." The great work of restoring ruined Zion is to be spoken of in
those golden ages when the heathen nations shall be converted unto God;
even those glorious times will not be able to despise that grand event,
which, like the passage of Israel through the Red Sea, will never be
eclipsed and never cease to awaken the enthusiasm of the chosen people.
Happy will the day be when all nations shall unite in the sole worship
of Jehovah, then shall the histories of the olden times be read with
adoring wonder, and the hand of the Lord shall be seen as having ever
rested upon the sacramental host of his elect: then shall shouts of
exulting praise ascend to heaven in honour of him who loosed
the-captives, delivered the condemned, raised up the desolations of
ages, and made out of stones and rubbish a temple for his worship.

[Psa 102:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#023.md)

"He weakened my strength in the way." Here the Psalmist comes down again
to the mournful string, and pours forth his personal complaint. His
sorrow had cast down his spirit, and even caused weakness in his bodily
frame, so that he was like a pilgrim who limped along the road, and was
ready to lie down and die. "He shortened my days." Though he had bright
hopes for Jerusalem, he feared that he should have departed this life
long before those visions had become realities; he felt that he was
pining away and would be a shortlived man. Perhaps this may be our lot,
and it will materially help us to be content with it, if we are
persuaded that the grandest of all interests is safe, and the good old
cause secure in the hands of the Lord.

[Psa 102:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#024.md)

"I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days." He betook
himself to prayer. What better remedy is there for heart-sickness and
depression? We may lawfully ask for recovery from sickness and may hope
to be heard. Good men should not dread death, but they are not forbidden
to love life: for many reasons the man who has the best hope of heaven,
may nevertheless think it desirable to continue here a little longer,
for the sake of his family, his work, the church of God, and even the
glory of God itself. Some read the passage, "Take me not up," let me not
ascend like disappearing smoke, do not whirl me away like Elijah in a
chariot of fire, for as yet I have only seen half my days, and that a
sorrowful hall; give me to live till the blustering morning shall have
softened into a bright afternoon of happier existence. "Thy years are
throughout all generations." Thou livest, Lord; let me live also. A
fulness of existence is with thee, let me partake therein. Note the
contrast between himself pining and ready to expire, and his God living
on in the fulness of strength for ever and ever; this contrast is full
of consolatory power to the man whose heart is stayed upon the Lord.
Blessed be his name, he faileth not, and, therefore, our hope shall not
fail us, neither will we despair for ourselves or for his church.

[Psa 102:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#025.md)

"Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth." Creation is no new
work with God, and therefore to "create Jerusalem a praise in the earth"
will not be difficult to him. Long ere the holy city was laid in ruins
the Lord made a world out of nothing, and it will be no labour to him to
raise the walls from their heaps and replace the stones in their
courses. We can neither continue our own existence nor give being to
others; but the Lord not only is, but he is the Maker of all things that
are; hence, when our affairs are at the very lowest ebb we are not all
despairing, because the Almighty and Eternal Lord can yet restore us.
"And the heavens are the work of thine hands." Thou canst therefore not
merely lay the foundations of Zion, but complete its roof, even as thou
hast arched in the world with its ceiling of blue; the loftiest stories
of thine earthly palace shall be piled on high without difficulty when
thou dost undertake the building thereof, since thou art architect of
the stars, and the spheres in which they move. When a great labour is to
be performed it is eminently reassuring to contemplate the power of him
who has undertaken to accomplish it; and when our own strength is
exhausted it is supremely cheering to see the unfailing energy which is
still engaged on our behalf.

[Psa 102:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#026.md)

"They shall perish, but thou shall endure." The power which made them
shall dissolve them, even as the city of thy love was destroyed at thy
command; yet neither the ruined city nor the ruined earth can make a
change in thee, reverse thy purpose, or diminish thy glory. Thou
standest when all things fall. "Yea, all of them shall wax old like a
garment; as a vesture shall thou change them, and they shall be
changed." Time impairs all things, the fashion becomes obsolete and
passes away. The visible creation, which is like the garment of the
invisible God, is waxing old and wearing out, and our great King is not
so poor that he must always wear the same robes; he will ere long fold
up the worlds and put them aside as worn out vestures, and he will array
himself in new attire, making a new heaven and a new earth wherein
dwelleth righteousness. How readily will all this be done. "Thou shalt
change them and they shall be changed;" as in the creation so in the
restoration, omnipotence shall work its way without hindrance.

[Psa 102:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#027.md)

"But thou art the same," or, "thou art he." As a man remains the same
when he has changed his clothing, so is the Lord evermore the unchanging
One, though his works in creation may be changed, and the operations of
his providence may vary. When heaven and earth shall flee away from the
dread presence of the great Judge, he will be unaltered by the terrible
confusion, and the world in conflagration will effect no change in him;
even so, the Psalmist remembered that when Israel was vanquished, her
capital destroyed, and her temple levelled with the ground, her God
remained the same self-existent, all-sufficient being, and would restore
his people, even as he will restore the heavens and the earth, bestowing
at the same time a new glory never known before. The doctrine of the
immutability of God should be more considered than it is, for the
neglect of it tinges the theology of many religious teachers, and makes
them utter many things of which they would have seen the absurdity long
ago if they had remembered the divine declaration, "I am God, I change
not, therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed." "And thy years shall
have no end." God lives on, no decay can happen to him, or destruction
overtake him. What a joy is this! We may lose our dearest earthly
friends, but not our heavenly Friend. Men's days are often suddenly cut
short, and at the longest they are but few, but the years of the right
hand of the Most High cannot be counted, for they have neither first nor
last, beginning nor end. O my soul, rejoice thou in the Lord always,
since he is always the same.

[Psa 102:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#028.md)

"The children of thy servants shall continue." The Psalmist had early in
the Psalm looked forward to a future generation, and here he speaks with
confidence that such a race would arise and be preserved and blessed of
God. Some read it as a prayer, "let the sons of thy servants abide." Any
way, it is full of good cheer to us; we may plead for the Lord's favour
to our seed, and we may expect that the cause of God and truth will
revive in future generations. Let us hope that those who are to succeed
us will not be so stubborn, unbelieving and erring as we have been. If
the church has been minished and brought low by the lukewarmness of the
present race, let us entreat the Lord to raise up a better order of men,
whose zeal and obedience shall win and hold a long prosperity. May our
own dear ones be among the better generation who shall continue in the
Lord's ways, obedient to the end. "And their seed shall be established
before thee." God does not neglect the children of his servants. It is
the rule that Abraham's Isaac should be the Lord's, that Isaac's Jacob
should be beloved of the Most High, and that Jacob's Joseph should find
favour in the sight of God. Grace is not hereditary, yet God loves to be
served by the same family time out of mind, even as many great
landowners feel a pleasure in having the same families as tenants upon
their estates from generation to generation. Here is Zion's hope, her
sons will build her up, her offspring will restore her former glories.
We may, therefore, not only for our own sakes, but also out of love to
the church of God, daily pray that our sons and daughters may be saved,
and kept by divine grace even unto the end, - established before the
Lord.

We have thus passed through the cloud, and in the next Psalm we shall
bask in the sunshine. Such is the chequered experience of the believer.
Paul in the seventh of Romans cries and groans, and then in the eighth
rejoices and leaps for joy; and so, from the moaning' of the hundred and
second Psalm, we now advance to the songs and dancing of the hundred and
third, blessing the Lord that, "though weeping may endure for a night,
joy cometh in the morning."
