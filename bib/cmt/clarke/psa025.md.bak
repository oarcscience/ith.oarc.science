### [Psalms Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 25:0</span></span>

The psalmist, in great distress, calls upon God frequently, [Psa
25:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#001.md); prays for pardon with the
strong confidence of being heard, [Psa
25:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#006.md); shows the blessedness of the
righteous, [Psa 25:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#012.md); again
earnestly implores the Divine mercy; and prays for the restoration of
Israel, [Psa 25:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#015.md).

This Psalm seems to refer to the case of the captives in Babylon, who
complain of oppression from their enemies, and earnestly beg the help
and mercy of God.

It is the first of those called acrostic Psalms, i.e., Psalms each line
of which begins with a several letter of the Hebrew alphabet in their
common order. Of acrostic Psalms there are seven, viz., 25, 34, 37, [Psa
111:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#001.md), [Psa
112:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#001.md), 119, and 145. It is
fashionable to be violent in encomiums on the Jews for the very faithful
manner in which they have preserved the Hebrew Scriptures; but these
encomiums are, in general, ill placed. Even this Psalm is a proof with
what carelessness they have watched over the sacred deposit committed to
their trust. The letter ו vau is wanting in the fifth verse, and ק koph
in the eighteenth; the letter ר resh being twice inserted, once instead
of ק koph, and a whole line added at the end, entirely out of the
alphabetical series.

[Psalms 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 25:1</span></span>

Do I lift up my soul - His soul was cast down, and by prayer and faith
he endeavours to lift it up to God.

[Psalms 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 25:2</span></span>

I trust in thee - I depend upon thy infinite goodness and mercy for my
support and salvation.

Let me not be ashamed - Hide my iniquity, and forgive my guilt.

[Psalms 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 25:3</span></span>

Let none that wait on thee be ashamed - Though he had burden enough of
his own, he felt for others in similar circumstances, and became an
intercessor in their behalf.

Transgress without cause - Perhaps בוגדים bogedim may here mean
idolatrous persons. "Let not them that wait upon and worship thee be
ashamed: but they shall be ashamed who vainly worship, or trust in false
gods." See [Mal 2:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#011.md). The Chaldeans
have evil entreated us, and oppressed us: they trust in their idols, let
them see the vanity of their idolatry.

[Psalms 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 25:4</span></span>

Show me thy ways - The psalmist wishes to know God's way, to be taught
his path, and to be led into his truth. He cannot discern this way
unless God show it; he cannot learn the path unless God teach it; and he
cannot walk in God's truth unless God lead him: and even then, unless
God continue to teach, he shall never fully learn the lessons of his
salvation; therefore he adds, "Lead me in thy truth, and teach me;" [Psa
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#005.md).

That he may get this showing, teaching, and leading, he comes to God, as
the "God of his salvation;" and that he may not lose his labor, he
"waits on him all the day." Many lose the benefit of their earnest
prayers, because they do not persevere in them. They pray for a time;
get remiss or discouraged; restrain prayer; and thus lose all that was
already wrought for and in them.

[Psalms 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 25:5</span></span>

On thee do I wait - This is the line in which ו vau, the sixth letter in
the order of the alphabet, is lost; for the line begins with א aleph,
אותך othecha, "on thee." But four of Kennicott's and De Rossi's MSS.
have ואותך veothecha, "And upon thee." This restores the lost ו vau,
which signifies "and." The Septuagint, Syriac, Vulgate, Arabic,
Ethiopic, and Anglo-Saxon, preserve it.

[Psalms 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 25:6</span></span>

Remember, O Lord, thy tender mercies, and thy loving-kindness - The word
רחמים rachamim, means the commiseration that a man feels in his bowels
at the sight of distress. The second word, חסדים chasadim, signifies
those kindnesses which are the offspring of a profusion of benevolence.

They have been ever of old - Thou wert ever wont to display thyself as a
ceaseless fountain of good to all thy creatures.

[Psalms 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 25:7</span></span>

Remember not the sins of my youth - Those which I have committed through
inconsiderateness, and heat of passion.

According to thy mercy - As it is worthy of thy mercy to act according
to the measure, the greatness, and general practice of thy mercy; so
give me an abundant pardon, a plentiful salvation.

For thy goodness' sake - Goodness is the nature of God; mercy flows from
that goodness.

[Psalms 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 25:8</span></span>

Good and upright is the Lord - He is good in his nature, and righteous
in his conduct.

Therefore will he teach sinners - Because he is good, he will teach
sinners, though they deserve nothing but destruction: and because he is
right, he will teach them the true way.

[Psalms 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 25:9</span></span>

The meek will he guide - ענוים anavim, the poor, the distressed; he will
lead in judgment - he will direct them in their cause, and bring it to a
happy issue, for he will show them the way in which they should go.

[Psalms 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 25:10</span></span>

All the paths of the Lord - ארחות orchoth signifies the tracks or ruts
made by the wheels of wagons by often passing over the same ground.
Mercy and truth are the paths in which God constantly walks in reference
to the children of men; and so frequently does he show them mercy, and
so frequently does he fulfill his truth that his paths are earnestly
discerned. How frequent, how deeply indented, and how multiplied are
those tracks to every family and individual! Wherever we go, we see that
God's mercy and truth have been there by the deep tracks they have left
behind them. But he is more abundantly merciful to those who keep his
covenant and his testimonies; i.e. those who are conformed, not only to
the letter, but to the spirit of his pure religion.

[Psalms 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 25:11</span></span>

For thy name's sake, O Lord, pardon - I have sinned; I need mercy; there
is no reason why thou shouldst show it, but what thou drawest from the
goodness of thy own nature.

[Psalms 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 25:12</span></span>

That feareth the Lord - Who has a proper apprehension of his holiness,
justice, and truth; and who, at the same time, sees himself a fallen
spirit, and a transgressor of God's holy law, and consequently under the
curse. That is the person that truly and reverently fears God.

Him shall he teach - Such a person has a teachable spirit.

The way that he shall choose - The way that in the course of Providence
he has chosen, as the way in which he is to gain things honest in the
sight of all men; God will bless him in it, and give him as much earthly
prosperity as may be useful to his soul in his secular vocation.

[Psalms 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 25:13</span></span>

His soul shall dwell at ease - בטוב תלין betob talin, "shall lodge in
goodness;" this is the marginal reading in our version; and is
preferable to that in the text.

His seed shall inherit - His posterity shall be blessed. For them many
prayers have been sent up to God by their pious fathers; and God has
registered these prayers in their behalf.

[Psalms 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 25:14</span></span>

The secret of the Lord is with them - טוד sod, the secret assembly of
the Lord is with them that fear him; many of them have a Church in their
own house.

He will show them his covenant - He will let them see how great
blessings he has provided for them that love him. Some refer this to the
covenant of redemption by Christ Jesus.

[Psalms 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 25:15</span></span>

Mine eyes are ever toward the Lord - All my expectation is from him
alone. If I get at any time entangled, he will pluck my feet out of the
net.

[Psalms 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 25:16</span></span>

Turn thee unto me - Probably the prayer of the poor captives in Bablyon,
which is continued through this and the remaining verses.

[Psalms 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 25:17</span></span>

The troubles of may heart are enlarged - The evils of our captive state,
instead of lessening, seem to multiply, and each to be extended.

[Psalms 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 25:18</span></span>

Look upon mine affliction - See my distressed condition, and thy eye
will affect thy heart.

Forgive all my sins - My sins are the cause of all my sufferings;
forgive these.

This is the verse which should begin with the letter ק koph; but,
instead of it, we have ר resh both here, where it should not be, and in
the next verse where it should be. Dr. Kennicott reads קומה kumah,
"arise," and Houbigant, קצר ketsar, "cut short." The word which began
with ק koph has been long lost out of the verse, as every version seems
to have read that which now stands in the Hebrew text.

[Psalms 25:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 25:19</span></span>

Consider mine enemies - Look upon them, and thou wilt see how impossible
it is that I should be able to resist and overcome them. They are many,
they hate me, and their hatred drives them to acts of cruelty against
me.

[Psalms 25:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 25:20</span></span>

O keep my soul - Save me from sin, and keep me alive.

Let me not be ashamed - He ends as he began; see [Psa
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#002.md) : "Let me not be confounded, for
I put my trust in thee."

[Psalms 25:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 25:21</span></span>

Let integrity and uprightness - I wish to have a perfect heart, and an
upright life. This seems to be the meaning of these two words.

[Psalms 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 25:22</span></span>

Redeems Israel, O God - The people are prayed for in the preceding
verses as if one person; now he includes the whole, lest his own
personal necessities should narrow his heart. and cause him to forget
his fellow sufferers.

This verse stands out of the order of the Psalm; and does not appear to
have formed a part of the alphabetical arrangement. It is a general
prayer for the redemption of Israel from captivity; and may well be
applied to those of the true Israel who are seeking for complete
redemption from the power, the guilt, and the pollution of sin; and from
all the troubles that spring from it. And let it be ever known, that God
alone can redeem Israel.
