### [Revelation Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#001)

[Revelation](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">rev 10:0</span></span>

The description of a mighty angel with a little book in his hand, [Rev
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#001), [Rev
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#002). The seven thunders, [Rev
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#003), [Rev
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#004). The angel swears that there
shalt be time no longer, [Rev 10:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#005).
John is commanded to take the little book and eat it; he does so, and
receives a commission to prophesy to many peoples, [Rev
10:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#008).

[Revelation 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 10:1</span></span>

Another mighty angel - Either Christ or his representative; clothed with
a cloud; a symbol of the Divine majesty.

A rainbow was upon his head - The token of God's merciful covenant with
mankind.

His face was as it were the sun - So intensely glorious that it could
not be looked on.

His feet as pillars of fire - To denote the rapidity and energy of his
motions, and the stability of his counsels.

[Revelation 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 10:2</span></span>

A little book open - Meaning probably some design of God long concealed,
but now about to be made manifest. But who knows what it means?

His right foot upon the sea, and his left - on the earth - To show that
he had the command of each, and that his power was universal, all things
being under his feet.

[Revelation 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 10:3</span></span>

Seven thunders - Seven being a number of perfection, it may here mean
many, great, loud, and strong peals of thunder, accompanied with
distinct voices; but what was said, St. John was not permitted to
reveal, [Rev 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#004).

[Revelation 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 10:5</span></span>

Lifted up his hand to heaven - As one making an appeal to the supreme
Being.

[Revelation 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 10:6</span></span>

By him that liveth for ever and ever - The eternal, self-existent
Jehovah, the Maker of all things.

That there should be time no longer - That the great counsels relative
to the events already predicted should be immediately fulfilled, and
that there should be no longer delay. This has no reference to the day
of judgment.

[Revelation 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 10:7</span></span>

The mystery of God should be finished - What this mystery refers to who
knows? Nor have we more knowledge concerning the sounding of the seventh
angel. On these points there is little agreement among learned men.
Whether it mean the destruction of Jerusalem, or the destruction of the
papal power, or something else, we know not. And yet with what
confidence do men speak of the meaning of these hidden things!

Declared to his servants the prophets - It is most likely, therefore,
that this trumpet belongs to the Jewish state.

[Revelation 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 10:8</span></span>

Take the little book which is open - Learn from this angel what should
be published to the world.

[Revelation 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 10:9</span></span>

Take it, and eat it up - Fully comprehend its meaning; study it
thoroughly.

[Revelation 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 10:10</span></span>

It was in my mouth sweet as honey - There was in it some pleasing, some
unpleasing, intelligence. I read of the consolations and protection of
the true worshippers of God, and did rejoice; I read of the persecutions
of the Church, and was distressed.

[Revelation 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 10:11</span></span>

Thou must prophesy again - Thou must write, not only for the instruction
of the Jews in Palestine, but of those in the different provinces, as
well as the heathens and heathen emperors and potentates in general.

The reader will find, on comparing this chapter with Daniel 8:1-27; [Dan
12:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001), and Ezekiel 2:1-3:27, that
there are several things similar in both; and the writer of the
Apocalypse appears to keep these two prophets continually in view. I
must once more say that I do not understand these prophecies, therefore
I do not take upon me to explain them. I see with regret how many
learned men have mistaken their way here. Commentators, and even some of
the most modern, have strangely trifled in these solemn things; all
trumpets, vials, woes, etc., are perfectly easy to them; yet from their
descriptions, none get wise either to common sense or to the things that
make for their peace.

On the same ground I cannot admit the interpretation that is given of
the word χρονος, translated time in [Rev
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#006), which some have construed into
an artificial period of 1,111 years, which they term chronos; hence we
have the chronos, half-chronos, and non-chronos. Bengel has said much on
these points, but to very little purpose; the word in the above place
seems to signify delay simply, and probably refers to the long-suffering
of God being ended in reference to Jerusalem; for I all along take for
probable that this book was written previously to the destruction of
that city.
