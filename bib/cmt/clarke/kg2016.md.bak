### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg2 16:0</span></span>

Ahaz begins to reign, acts wickedly, and restores idolatry in Judea,
[Kg2 16:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#001.md). Rezin, king of Syria,
besieges Jerusalem, but cannot take it; he takes Elath, and drives the
Jews thence, [Kg2 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#005.md), [Kg2
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#006.md). Ahaz hires Tiglath-pileser
against the king of Syria and the king of Israel, and gives him the
silver and gold that were found in the treasures of the house of the
Lord, [Kg2 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#007.md), [Kg2
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#008.md). Tiglath-pileser takes Damascus
and slays Rezin, [Kg2 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#009.md). Ahaz goes
to meet him at Damascus: sees an altar there, a pattern of which he
sends to Urijah, the priest; and orders him to make one like it, which
he does, [Kg2 16:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#010.md). He makes
several alterations in the temple; dies; and Hezekiah his son reigns in
his stead, [Kg2 16:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#016.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 16:2</span></span>

Twenty years old was Ahaz - Here is another considerable difficulty in
the chronology. Ahaz was but twenty years old when he began to reign,
and he died after he had reigned sixteen years; consequently his whole
age amounted only to thirty-six years. But Hezekiah his son was
twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and if this were so, then
Ahaz must have been the father of Hezekiah when he was but eleven years
of age! Some think that the twenty years mentioned here respect the
beginning of the reign of Jotham, father of Ahaz; so that the passage
should be thus translated: Ahaz was twenty years of age when his father
began to reign; and consequently he was fifty-two years old when he
died, seeing Jotham reigned sixteen years: and therefore Hezekiah was
born when his father was twenty-seven years of age. This however is a
violent solution, and worthy of little credit. It is better to return to
the text as it stands, and allow that Ahaz might be only eleven or
twelve years old when he had Hezekiah: this is not at all impossible; as
we know that the youth of both sexes in the eastern countries are
marriageable at ten or twelve years of age, and are frequently betrothed
when they are but nine. I know a woman, an East Indian, who had the
second of her two first children when she was only fourteen years of
age, and must have had the first when between eleven and twelve. I hold
it therefore quite a possible case that Ahaz might have had a son born
to him when he was but eleven or twelve years old.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 16:3</span></span>

Made his son to pass through the fire - On this passage I beg leave to
refer the reader to my notes on [Lev
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021.md); [Lev
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#002.md), [Lev
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#014.md), where the subject is considered
at large.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 16:5</span></span>

But could not overcome him - It is likely that this was the time when
Isaiah was sent to console Ahaz; (see [Isa
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#001).md); and predicted the death both of
Rezin and Pekah, his enemies.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 16:6</span></span>

Recovered Elath to Syria - See the note on [Kg2
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#022.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 16:7</span></span>

I am thy servant and thy son - I will obey thee in all, and become
tributary to thee; only help me against Syria and Israel.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 16:9</span></span>

The king of Assyria hearkened unto him - It is said, [Ch2
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#020.md), that Tilgath-pilneser
distressed him, but strengthened him not.

Though he came against the Syrians, and took Damascus, and slew Rezin,
yet he did not help Ahaz against the Philistines, nor did he lend him
any forces to assist against Israel; and he distressed him by taking the
royal treasures, and the treasures of the temple, and did him little
service for so great a sacrifice. He helped him a little, but distressed
him on the whole.

It appears that, about this time, Pekah king of Israel nearly ruined
Judea: it is said, [Ch2 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#006.md), that he
slew one hundred thousand valiant men in one day; and that he carried
away captive to Samaria two hundred thousand women and children, and
much spoil; but, at the instance of the prophet Oded, these were all
sent back, fed and clothed, [Ch2
28:8-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#008.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 16:10</span></span>

Ahaz went to Damascus - He had received so much help on the defeat of
Rezin, that he went to Damascus to meet the king of Assyria, and render
him thanks.

Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar - This was some
idolatrous altar, the shape and workmanship of which pleased Ahaz so
well that he determined to have one like it at Jerusalem. For this he
had no Divine authority, and the compliance of Urijah was both mean and
sinful. That Ahaz did this for an idolatrous purpose, is evident from
[Ch2 28:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#021.md) : "For he sacrificed to
the gods of Damascus; - and he said, Because the gods of the kings of
Syria help them, I will sacrifice to them, that they may help me. And he
made high places to burn incense to other gods in every city of Judah."

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 16:14</span></span>

Put it on the north side - He seems to have intended to conform every
thing in the Lord's house as much as possible to the idolatrous temples
which he saw at Damascus, and to model the Divine worship in the same
way: in a word to honor and worship the gods of Syria, and not the God
of heaven. All the alterations specified here were in contempt of the
true God. Thus he provoked to anger the Lord God of his fathers, [Ch2
28:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#025.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 16:18</span></span>

And the covert for the Sabbath - There are a great number of conjectures
concerning this covert, or, as it is in the Hebrew, the מוסך musach, of
the Sabbath. As the word, and others derived from the same root, signify
covering or booths, it is very likely that this means either a sort of
canopy which was erected on the Sabbath days for the accommodation of
the people who came to worship, and which Ahaz took away to discourage
them from that worship; or a canopy under which the king and his family
reposed themselves, and which he transported to some other place to
accommodate the king of Assyria when he visited him. Jarchi supposes
that it was a sort of covert way that the kings of Judah had to the
temple, and Ahaz had it removed lest the king of Assyria, going by that
way, and seeing the sacred vessels, should covet them. If that way had
been open, he might have gone by it into the temple, and have seen the
sacred vessels, and so have asked them from a man who was in no
condition to refuse them, however unwilling he might be to give them up.
The removing of this, whatever it was, whether throne or canopy, or
covered way, cut off the communication between the king's house and the
temple; and the king of Assyria would not attempt to go into that sacred
place by that other passage to which the priests alone had access.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 16:20</span></span>

Was buried with his fathers in the city of David - But it is expressly
declared, [Ch2 28:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#027.md), that he was not
buried in the sepulchres of the kings of Israel; and this was
undoubtedly intended as a mark of degradation.

His reign was disastrous and impious; and it was disastrous because it
was impious. He had been a scourge, not a blessing, to his people. He
had not only made illegal alterations in the temple, and in the mode of
worship prescribed by the true God, but he had polluted all the cities
of Judah with idolatry, and brought ruin upon the nation. On the whole,
a worse king than himself had not as yet sat on the Jewish throne; and
yet he had many advantages: he had for counsellor one of the greatest
men ever produced in the Jewish nation, Isaiah the prophet; and God
condescended to interpose especially for him when grievously straitened
by the kings of Israel and Syria, both of whom were cut off according to
the prediction of this prophet. But he would not lay it to heart, and
therefore the wrath of God fell heavily upon him, and upon the
stiff-necked and rebellious people whom he governed. He had sufficient
warning and was without excuse. He would sin, and therefore he must
suffer.
