### [Proverbs Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">pro 7:0</span></span>

A farther exhortation to acquire wisdom, in order to be preserved from
impure connections, [Pro 7:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#001.md). The
character of a harlot, and her conduct towards a youth who fell into her
snare, vv. 6-23. Solemn exhortations to avoid this evil, [Pro
7:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#024.md).

[Proverbs 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 7:1</span></span>

My son, keep my words - See [Pro 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#001.md).

[Proverbs 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 7:2</span></span>

As the apple of thine eye - As the pupil of the eye, which is of such
essential necessity to sight, and so easily injured.

[Proverbs 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 7:3</span></span>

Bind them upon thy fingers - See on [Pro
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#003) (note.md).

[Proverbs 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 7:4</span></span>

Thou art my sister - Thou art my dearest friend, and I will treat thee
as such.

[Proverbs 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 7:5</span></span>

The strange woman - The prostitute, the adulteress.

[Proverbs 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 7:6</span></span>

I looked through my casement - The casement is a small aperture in a
large window, or a window opening on hinges. Here it means the lattice,
for they had no glass windows in the East. And the latticed windows
produced a double advantage

1\. Making the apartments sufficiently private; and

2\. Admitting fresh air to keep them cool.

[Proverbs 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 7:7</span></span>

Among the simple ones - The inexperienced, inconsiderate young men.

A young man void of understanding - בעל ראשאהץ חסר לב, "destitute of a
heart." He had not wisdom to discern the evil intended; nor courage to
resist the flatteries of the seducer.

[Proverbs 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 7:8</span></span>

He went the way to her house - She appears to have had a corner house
sufficiently remarkable; and a way from the main street to it.

[Proverbs 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 7:9</span></span>

In the twilight, in the evening - Some time after sun-setting; before it
was quite dark.

In the black and dark night - When there were neither lamps nor
moon-shine.

[Proverbs 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 7:10</span></span>

A woman with the attire of a harlot - It appears that sitting in some
open place, and covering the face, or having a veil of a peculiar kind
on, was the evidence of a harlot, [Gen
38:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#014.md), [Gen
38:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#015.md). No doubt, in Solomon's time,
they had other distinctions. In all other countries, and in all times.
the show of their countenance did testify against them; they declared
their sin as Sodom; they hid it not. However, this does not seem to have
been a mere prostitute; for she was, according to her own declaration, a
married woman, and kept house, [Pro
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#019.md), if her assertions relative to
this were not falsehoods, and calculated the better to render him
secure, and prevent the suspicion of endangering himself by cohabiting
with a common woman; which I am rather inclined to think was the case,
for she was subtle of heart.

[Proverbs 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 7:11</span></span>

She is loud and stubborn - המיה homiyah, she is never at rest, always
agitated; busily employed to gain her end, and this is to go into the
path of error: סררת sorereth, "turning aside;" preferring any way to the
right way. And, therefore, it is added, her feet abide not in her house,
she gads abroad; and this disposition probably first led her to this
vice.

[Proverbs 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 7:12</span></span>

Now is she without - She is continually exposing herself, and showing by
her gait and gestures what she is, and what she wants. These two verses
are a parenthesis, intended to show the character of the woman.

[Proverbs 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 7:13</span></span>

So she caught him - Laid fast hold on him, and kissed him, to show that
she was affectionately attached to him.

And with an impudent face - העזה פניה heezzah paneyha, "she strengthened
her countenance," assumed the most confident look she could; endeavored
to appear friendly and sincere.

[Proverbs 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 7:14</span></span>

I have peace-offerings with me - More literally, "the sacrifices of the
peace-offerings are with me." Peace-offerings Mymlv shelamim, were
offerings the spiritual design of which was to make peace between God
and man, to make up the breach between them which sin had occasioned;
see the notes on Leviticus 7 (note), where every kind of sacrifice
offered under the law is explained. When the blood of these was poured
out at the altar, and the fat burnt there, the breast and right shoulder
were the priest's portion; but the rest of the carcass belonged to the
sacrificer, who might carry it home, and make a feast to his friends.
See [Lev 3:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#001.md). Much light is cast on
this place by the fact that the gods in many parts of the East are
actually worshipped in brothels, and fragments of the offerings are
divided among the wretches who fall into the snare of the prostitutes -
Ward's Customs.

Have I payed my vows - She seems to insinuate that she had made a vow
for the health and safety of this young man; and having done so, and
prepared the sacrificial banquet, came actually out to seek him, that he
might partake of it with her, [Pro
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#015.md). But, as she intended to proceed
farther than mere friendship, she was obliged to avail herself of the
night season, and the absence of her husband.

[Proverbs 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 7:16</span></span>

I have decked my bed - ערשי arsi, "my couch or sofa;" distinguished from
משכבי mishcabi, "my bed," [Pro 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#017.md),
the place to sleep on, as the other was the place to recline on at
meals. The tapestry, מרבדים marbaddim, mentioned here seems to refer to
the covering of the sofa; exquisitely woven and figured cloth. חטבות
אטון chatuboth etun, the Targum translates painted carpets, such as were
manufactured in Egypt; some kind of embroidered or embossed stuff is
apparently meant.

[Proverbs 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 7:17</span></span>

I have perfumed any bed with Myrrh - מר mor, "aloes," אהלים ahalim, and
"cinnamon," קנמון kinnamon. We have taken our names from the original
words; but probably the ahalim may not mean aloes, which is no perfume;
but sandal wood, which is very much used in the East. She had used every
means to excite the passions she wished to bring into action.

[Proverbs 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 7:18</span></span>

Come, let us take our fill of love - נרוה דדים nirveh dodim, "Let us
revel in the breasts;" and then it is added, "Let us solace ourselves
with loves," נתעלסה באהבים nithallesah boohabim; "let us gratify each
other with loves, with the utmost delights." This does not half express
the original; but I forbear. The speech shows the brazen face of this
woman, well translated by the Vulgate, "Veni, inebriemur uberibus; et
fruamur cupidinis amplexibus." And the Septuagint has expressed the
spirit of it: Ελθε, και απολαυσωμεν φιλιας - δευρο, και εγκυλισθωμεν
ερωτι. "Veni, et fruamur amicitia - Veni, et colluctemur cupidine."
Though varied in the words, all the versions have expressed the same
thing. In the old MS. Bible, the speech of this woman is as follows: I
have arrayed with cordis my litil bed, and spred with peyntid tapetis of
Egipt: I have springid my ligginge place with mirre and aloes and
calelcum, and be we inwardly drunken with Tetis, and use we the
coveytied clippingis to the tyme that the dai wax light. The original
itself is too gross to be literally translated; but quite in character
as coming from the mouth of an abandoned woman.

[Proverbs 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 7:19</span></span>

For the good man - Literally, "For the man is not in his house."

[Proverbs 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 7:20</span></span>

He hath taken - Literally, "The money bag he hath taken in his hand." He
is gone a journey of itinerant merchandising. This seems to be what is
intended.

And will come home at the day appointed - ליום הכסא leyom hakkase, the
time fixed for a return from such a journey. The Vulgate says, "at the
full moon." The Targum, "the day of the assembly." In other words, He
will return by the approaching festival.

[Proverbs 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 7:21</span></span>

With her much fair speech - With her blandishments and lascivious talk,
she overcame all his scruples, and constrained him to yield.

[Proverbs 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 7:22</span></span>

As an ox goeth to the slaughter - The original of this and the following
verse has been variously translated. Dr. Grey corrects and translates
thus: "He goeth after her straightway, as an Ox goeth to the Slaughter;
as a Dog to the Chain; and as a Deer till the Dart strike through his
liver; as a Bird hasteneth to the Snare, and knoweth not that it is for
its life." Very slight alterations in the Hebrew text produce these
differences; but it is not necessary to pursue them; all serve to mark
the stupidity and folly of the man who is led away by enticing women or
who lives a life of intemperance.

[Proverbs 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 7:24</span></span>

Hearken unto me now, therefore, O ye children - Ye that are young and
inexperienced, seriously consider the example set before your eyes, and
take warning at another's expense.

[Proverbs 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 7:26</span></span>

For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been
slain by her - That is, such like women have been the ruin of many.
חללים chalalim, which we render wounded, also signifies solsliers or men
of war; and עצמים atsumim, which we render strong men, may be translated
heroes. Many of those who have distinguished themselves in the field and
in the cabinet have been overcome and destroyed by their mistresses.
History is full of such examples.

[Proverbs 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 7:27</span></span>

Her house is the way to hell - שאול sheol, the pit, the grave, the place
of the dead, the eternal and infernal world. And they who, through such,
fall into the grave, descend lower, into the chambers of death; the
place where pleasure is at an end, and illusion mocks no more.
