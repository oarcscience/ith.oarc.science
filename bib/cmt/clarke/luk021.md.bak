[Luke 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 21:1</span></span>

The rich men casting their gifts into the treasury - See all this, from
[Luk 21:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#001.md), explained on [Mar
12:41-44](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#041) (note.md).

[Luke 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 21:2</span></span>

A certain poor widow - A widow miserably poor; this is the proper import
of πενιχραν, and her being miserably poor heightened the merit of the
action.

Two mites - Which Mark says, [Mar
12:42](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#042.md), make a farthing or quadrans,
the fourth part of an As, or penny, as we term it. In Plutarch's time we
find the smallest piece of brass coin in use among the Romans was the
quadrans, but it appears that a smaller piece of money was in
circulation among the Jews in our Lord's time, called here, and in Mark,
[Mar 12:42](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#042.md), a lepton, i.e. small,
diminished, from λειπω, I fail. In ancient times our penny used to be
marked with a deep indented cross, dividing the piece into four equal
parts, which, when broken in two, made the half-penny, and, when broken
into four, made the fourthing, what we have corrupted into farthing.
Probably the Roman quadrans was divided in this way for the convenience
of the poor. Our term mite seems to have been taken from the animal
called by that name; for as that appeared to our ancestors to be the
smallest of all animals, so this being the smallest of all coins was
called by its name. Junius says that mite was a small base coin among
the Dutch. Our word mite seems to be a contraction of the Latin minutum,
a small thing, whence the French miete, a crumb, a very small morsel.
See the note on [Mar 12:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#041.md).

[Luke 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 21:5</span></span>

Goodly stones - Or, costly stones. It has been thought by some that this
relates not so much to the stones of which the temple was built, as to
the precious stones with which it was decorated. For an account of the
stones of the temple, see on [Mar 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#001.md)
(note).

And gifts - Or, consecrated things, αναθημασι. Αναθημα properly
signifies a thing consecrated to sacred uses: Αναθεμα signifies a thing
devoted to a curse, or to destruction. They both come from the same
root, ανατιθημι, I lay up, separate; and though two meanings cannot be
more opposite than those assigned to these words, yet in the words
themselves a short vowel (ε) in the place of a long one (η) makes all
the difference between blessing and cursing.

[Luke 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 21:6</span></span>

One stone upon another - This was literally fulfilled. See [Mat
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#002.md).

[Luke 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 21:8</span></span>

Many shall come in my name - Usurping my name: calling themselves the
Messiah. See [Mat 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#005.md). Concerning
this prediction of the destruction of Jerusalem, and its literal
accomplishment, see the notes on Matthew 24:1-42 (note).

[Luke 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 21:9</span></span>

Commotions - Seditions and civil dissensions, with which no people were
more agitated than the Jews.

[Luke 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 21:11</span></span>

Fearful sights - What these were the reader will find in detail on [Mat
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#007) (note.md).

[Luke 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 21:12</span></span>

Synagogues - Or, assemblies, etc. See these all explained on [Mar
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#009) (note.md).

[Luke 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 21:13</span></span>

It shall turn to you for a testimony - That is, it shall turn out on
your part for a testimony to them (your persecutors) that you are
thoroughly persuaded of the truth of what you teach, and that you are no
impostors.

[Luke 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 21:14</span></span>

Settle it therefore, etc. - See on [Mat
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#019) (note.md).

[Luke 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 21:15</span></span>

I will give you a mouth and wisdom - Στομα, a mouth, must appear plain
to every person to be used here for a ready utterance, or eloquence in
speaking. They shall have an abundance of wisdom to know what to say;
and they shall have an irresistible eloquence to say what they ought.

[Luke 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 21:18</span></span>

But there shall not a hair of your head perish - A proverbial expression
for, Ye shall not suffer any essential injury. Every genuine Christian
shall escape when this desolation comes upon the Jewish state.

[Luke 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 21:19</span></span>

In your patience - Rather, your perseverance, your faithful continuance
in my word and doctrine. Ye will preserve your souls. Ye shall escape
the Roman sword, and not one of you shall perish in the destruction of
Jerusalem. Instead of κτησασθε, possess, or preserve ye, I read
κτησεσθε, ye shall preserve. This reading is supported by AB-B, five
others; both the Syriac, all the Arabic, Ethiopic, Vulgate, all the
Itala except two, Origen, Macarius, and Tertullian.

[Luke 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 21:22</span></span>

These be the days of vengeance - See on [Mat
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#021) (note.md).

[Luke 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 21:24</span></span>

They shall fall by the edge of the sword - Those who perished in the
siege are reckoned to be not less than eleven hundred thousand. See [Mat
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#022.md).

And shall be led away captive - To the number of ninety-seven thousand.
See Josephus, War, b. vi. c. ix. s. 2, 3, and on [Mat
24:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#031) (note.md).

Trodden down of the Gentiles - Judea was so completely subjugated that
the very land itself was sold by Vespasian; the Gentiles possessing it,
while the Jews were either nearly all killed or led away into captivity.

Of the Gentiles be fulfilled - Till the different nations of the earth,
to whom God shall have given the dominion over this land, have
accomplished all that which the Lord hath appointed them to do; and till
the time of their conversion to God take place. But when shall this be?
We know not. The nations are still treading down Jerusalem, and the end
is known only to the Lord. See the note on [Mat
24:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#031.md).

[Luke 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 21:25</span></span>

The sea and the waves roaring - Figuratively pointing out the immense
Roman armies by which Judea was to be overrun and destroyed.

[Luke 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 21:26</span></span>

Men's hearts failing them for fear - Or, Men fainting away through fear,
(Αποψυχοντων), being ready to die.

Coming on the earth - Or, Coming upon this land, οικουμενῃ. See this
translation of the word vindicated in the note on [Luk
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001) (note.md).

[Luke 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 21:29</span></span>

He spake to them a parable - Illustrated all these predicted facts by
the simile of a fig tree. See this explained on [Mat
24:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#032) (note.md).

[Luke 21:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 21:31</span></span>

The kingdom of God is nigh at hand - After the destruction of the Jewish
state, the doctrine of Christ crucified shall be preached every where,
and every where prevail.

[Luke 21:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">luk 21:32</span></span>

This generation - This race of men; but see on [Mat
24:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#034) (note.md), and [Mar
13:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#030) (note.md).

[Luke 21:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 21:34</span></span>

Take heed to yourselves - See our Lord's parable, relative to this
matter, explained, [Mar 13:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#034) (note.md).

Be overcharged - Literally, be made heavy, as is generally the case with
those who have eaten or drank too much. Take heed that ye be not
rendered secure by an improper use of lawful things: do not make this
earth your portion: expect its dissolution, and prepare to meet your
God.

[Luke 21:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">luk 21:35</span></span>

The face of the whole earth - Or, of this whole land. The land of Judea,
on which these heavy judgments were to fall. See [Luk
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#025.md); see also [Luk
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001.md).

[Luke 21:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 21:36</span></span>

Watch ye therefore, and pray always - Perhaps we should connect ες παντι
καιρῳ, continually, with αγρυπνειτε, watch, as it appears to be the most
natural order. Indeed the word continually belongs equally to both watch
and pray; and no man is safe, at any time, who does not attend to this
advice as literally as possible.

That shall come to pass - That is, the tribulations which are on their
way to overwhelm and destroy the Jewish people. These are sufficiently
stated in the preceding verses.

To stand before the Son of man - To be acquitted, and to be condemned,
are expressed, in [Rom 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#004.md), by
standing and falling. Those who were faithful to the grace they had
received were not only not destroyed in the destruction of Jerusalem,
but became heralds of the grace and mercy of God to the nations. Thus
they were counted worthy to stand before the Son of man - to minister
salvation in his name.

[Luke 21:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 21:37</span></span>

And in the day time - Or, every day - τας ἡμερας. This probably relates
to the four last days of his life already mentioned.

Abode in the mount - He taught all day in the temple, and withdrew every
evening, and lodged in Bethany; a town at the foot, or on the declivity
of the mount of Olives. See the note on [Mat
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#017.md).

[Luke 21:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">luk 21:38</span></span>

The people came early - He returned early from the mount of Olives, and
the people came early in the morning to the temple to hear his teaching.
For practical observations on the awful subject of this chapter, see
Matthew 24 at the end.
