### [Psalms Chapter 113](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 113:0</span></span>

An exhortation to bless God for his own excellencies, [Psa
113:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001); and for his great mercy to
the poor and necessitous, [Psa
113:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#007).

[Psa 113:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001), [Psa
114:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#001), 115, 116, [Psa
117:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa117.htm#001), and 118, form the great
Hallel, and were sung by the Jews on their most solemn festivals, and
particularly at the passover. To these reference is made by the
evangelists, [Mat 26:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#030), and [Mar
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#026), there called the hymn which
Jesus and his disciples sung at the passover, for the whole of the
Psalms were considered as one grand hymn or thanksgiving. It was
probably composed after the return from the captivity. It has no title
but Hallelujah in the Hebrew and ancient Versions.

[Psalms 113:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 113:1</span></span>

Praise, O ye servants - Probably an address to the Levites. The
Anglo-Saxon has praise the Lord, ye knaves. Knapa or knave signified
among our ancestors a servant; sometimes a male, a young man.

[Psalms 113:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 113:3</span></span>

From the rising of the sun - From morning to evening be always employed
in the work. Or it may be a call on all mankind to praise God for his
innumerable mercies to the human race. Praise him from one end of the
world unto the other. And therefore the psalmist adds,

[Psalms 113:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 113:4</span></span>

The Lord is high above all nations - He governs all, he provides for
all; therefore let all give him praise.

[Psalms 113:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 113:5</span></span>

Who is like unto the Lord - Those who are highly exalted are generally
unapproachable; they are proud and overbearing; or so surrounded with
magnificence and flatterers, that to them the poor have no access; but
God, though infinitely exalted, humbleth himself to behold even heaven
itself, and much more does he humble himself when he condescends to
behold earth and her inhabitants; ([Psa
113:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#006)). But so does he love his
creatures that he rejoices over even the meanest of them to do them
good.

[Psalms 113:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 113:7</span></span>

He raiseth up the poor - The poorest man, in the meanest and most abject
circumstances, is an object of his merciful regards. He may here allude
to the wretched state of the captives in Babylon, whom God raised up out
of that dust and dunghill. Others apply it to the resurreetion of the
dead.

[Psalms 113:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 113:8</span></span>

With the princes - נדיבים nedebim, very properly translated by the
Anglo-Saxon, the aldermen, the most respectable of his people.

[Psalms 113:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 113:9</span></span>

He maketh the barren woman to keep house - This is a figure to point out
the desolate, decreasing state of the captives in Babylon, and the happy
change which took place on their return to their own land. These are
nearly the words of Hannah, [Sa1 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#005).
