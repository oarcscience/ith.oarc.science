### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa2 6:0</span></span>

David goes with thirty thousand men to being the ark from Kiriath-jearim
to Jerusalem, [Sa2 6:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#001). The ox
stumbling, Uzzah, who drove the cart on which the ark was placed, put
forth his hand to save it from falling: the Lord was displeased, and
smote him so that he died, [Sa2 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#006),
[Sa2 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#007). David, being alarmed,
carries the ark to the house of Obed-edom, [Sa2
6:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#008). Here it remained three months;
and God prospered Obed-edom, in whose house it was deposited, [Sa2
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#011). David, hearing of this, brings
the ark, with sacrifices and solemn rejoicings, to Jerusalem, [Sa2
6:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#012). Michal, seeing David dance
before the ark, despises him, [Sa2
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#016). He offers burnt-offerings and
peace offerings, and deals among all the people, men and women, a cake
of bread, a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine each, [Sa2
6:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#017). Michal coming to meet him,
and seeing him dance extravagantly before the ark, reproaches him for
his conduct: he vindicates himself, reproves her, and she dies
childless, [Sa2 6:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#020).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 6:1</span></span>

Thirty thousand - This is supposed to have been a new levy; and thus he
augmented his army by 30,000 fresh troops. The Septuagint has 70,000.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 6:2</span></span>

From Baale of Judah - This is supposed to be the same city which, in
[Jos 15:60](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#060), is called Kirjah-baal or
Kirjath-jearim; (see [Ch1 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#006)); or
Baalah, [Jos 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#009).

Whose name is called by the name of the Lord - That is, The ark is
called the ark of the Lord of hosts. But this is not a literal version;
the word שם shem, Name, occurs twice together; probably one of them
should be read שם sham, There. There the name of the Lord of hosts was
invoked, etc.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 6:3</span></span>

A new cart - Every thing used in the worship of God was hallowed or set
apart for that purpose: a new cart was used through respect, as that had
never been applied to any profane or common purpose. But this was not
sufficient, for the ark should have been carried on the shoulders of the
priests; and the neglect of this ceremony was the cause of the death of
Uzzah.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa2 6:5</span></span>

On all manner of instruments made of fir wood - This place should be
corrected from the parallel place, [Ch1
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#008) : "All Israel played before God,
with all their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with
psalteries," etc. Instead of בכל עצי bechol atsey, "with all woods" or
"trees;" the parallel place is בכל עז bechol oz. "with all their
strength:" this makes a good sense, the first makes none. The
Septuagint, in this place, has the verse reading; εν ισχυΐ, with might.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 6:6</span></span>

Uzzah put forth his hand - In [Num
4:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#015), the Levites are forbidden to
touch the ark on pain of death, this penalty was inflicted upon Uzzah,
and he was the first that suffered for a breach of this law.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa2 6:7</span></span>

Smote him there for his error - Uzzah sinned through ignorance and
precipitancy; he had not time to reflect, the oxen suddenly stumbled;
and, fearing lest the ark should fall, he suddenly stretched out his
hand to prevent it. Had he touched the ark with impunity, the populace
might have lost their respect for it and its sacred service, the example
of Uzzah must have filled them with fear and sacred reverence; and, as
to Uzzah, no man can doubt of his eternal safety. He committed a sin
unto death, but doubtless the mercy of God was extended to his soul.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa2 6:10</span></span>

But David carried it aside - The house of Obed-edom appears to have been
very near the city, which they were about to enter, but were prevented
by this accident, and lodged the ark with the nearest friend.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 6:11</span></span>

The Lord blessed Obed-edom - And why? Because he had the ark of the Lord
in his house. Whoever entertains God's messengers, or consecrates his
house to the service of God, will infallibly receive God's blessing.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 6:12</span></span>

So David - brought up the ark - The Vulgate adds to this verse: And
David had seven choirs, and a calf for a sacrifice. The Septuagint make
a greater addition: "And he had seven choirs carrying the ark, a
sacrifice, a calf, and lambs. And David played on harmonious organs
before the Lord; and David was clothed with a costly tunic; and David
and all the house of Israel, brought the ark of the Lord with rejoicing,
and the sound of a trumpet." Nothing of this is found in any MS., nor in
the Chaldee, the Syriac, nor the Arabic, nor in the parallel place, [Ch1
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#025).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 6:14</span></span>

And David danced before the Lord - Dancing is a religious ceremony among
the Hindoos, and they consider it an act of devotion to their idols. It
is evident that David considered it in the same light. What connection
dancing can have with devotion I cannot tell. This I know, that
unpremeditated and involuntary skipping may be the effect of sudden
mental elation.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 6:16</span></span>

She despised him in her heart - She did not blame him outwardly; she
thought he had disgraced himself, but she kept her mind to herself.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 6:18</span></span>

He blessed the people in the name of the Lord - David acted here as
priest, for it was the general prerogative of the priests to bless the
people, but it appears, by both David and Solomon, that it was the
prerogative of the kings also.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa2 6:19</span></span>

A cake of bread - Such as those which are baked without leaven, and are
made very thin.

A good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine - The words of flesh and of
wine we add; they are not in the Hebrew. The Chaldee translates one part
and one portion; but all the other versions understand the Hebrew as we
do.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa2 6:20</span></span>

To bless his household - This was according to the custom of the
patriarchs, who were priests in their own families. It is worthy of
remark, that David is called patriarch by Stephen, [Act
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#029), though living upwards of four
hundred years after the termination of the patriarchal age.

How glorious was the king of Israel - This is a strong irony. From what
Michal says, it is probable that David used some violent gesticulations,
by means of which some parts of his body became uncovered. But it is
very probable that we cannot guess all that was implied in this
reproach.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa2 6:21</span></span>

It was before the Lord, which chose me - David felt the reproach, and
was strongly irritated, and seems to have spoken to Michal with
sufficient asperity.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa2 6:22</span></span>

I will yet be more vile - The plain meaning of these words appears to be
this: "I am not ashamed of humbling myself before that God who rejected
thy father because of his obstinacy and pride, and chose me in his stead
to rule his people; and even those maid-servants, when they come to know
the motive of my conduct, shall acknowledge its propriety, and treat me
with additional respect; and as for thee, thou shalt find that thy
conduct is as little pleasing to God as it is to me." Then it is said,
Michal had no child till the day of her death: probably David never more
took her to his bed; or God, in his providence, might have subjected her
to barrenness which in Palestine was considered both a misfortune and a
reproach. Michal formed her judgment without reason, and meddled with
that which she did not understand. We should be careful how we attribute
actions, the reasons of which we cannot comprehend, to motives which may
appear to us unjustifiable or absurd. Rash judgments are doubly
pernicious; they hurt those who form them, and those of whom they are
formed.
