### [Jeremiah Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#001)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 16:0</span></span>

On account of the evils which threatened his country, the prophet is
forbidden to encumber himself with a wife and family, or to bear any
share in the little joys and sorrows of his neighbors, which were to be
forgotten and absorbed in those public calamities, [Jer
16:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#001), which their sins should draw
on them, [Jer 16:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#010). A future
restoration however is intimated, [Jer
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#014), [Jer
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#015), after these calamities should
be endured, [Jer 16:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#016); and the
conversion of the Gentiles is foretold, [Jer
16:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#019).

[Jeremiah 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 16:1</span></span>

The word of the Lord came also unto me - This discourse Dahler supposes
to have been delivered some time in the reign of Jehoiakim.

[Jeremiah 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 16:2</span></span>

Those shalt not take thee a wife - As it would be very inconvenient to
have a family when the threatened desolations should come on the place.
The reason is given in the following verses.

[Jeremiah 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 16:4</span></span>

They shall die of grievous deaths - All prematurely; see [Jer
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#016).

As dung upon the face of the earth - See [Jer
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#002).

Be meat for the fowls - See [Jer 7:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#033).

[Jeremiah 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 16:5</span></span>

Enter not into the house of mourning - The public calamities are too
great to permit individual losses to come into consideration.

[Jeremiah 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 16:6</span></span>

Nor cut themselves - A custom of the heathen forbidden to the Jews, [Lev
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#028); [Deu
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001), and which appears now to have
prevailed among them; because, having become idolaters, they conformed
to all the customs of the heathen. They tore their hair, rent their
garments, cut their hands, arms, and faces. These were not only signs of
sorrow but were even supposed to give ease to the dead, and appease the
angry deities. The Hindoos, on the death of a relation, express their
grief by loud lamentations, and not unfrequently bruise themselves in an
agony of grief with whatever they can lay hold on.

[Jeremiah 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 16:8</span></span>

Thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting - Funeral banquets
were made to commemorate the dead, and comfort the surviving relatives;
and the cup of consolation, strong mingled wine, was given to those who
were deepest in distress, to divert their minds and to soothe their
sorrows. These kinds of ceremonies were common among almost all the
nations of the world on funeral occasions. The Canaanites, the Jews, the
Persians, Arabians, New Zealanders, Huns, etc., etc.

[Jeremiah 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 16:12</span></span>

And ye have done worse than your fathers - The sins of the fathers would
not have been visited on the children, had they not followed their
example, and become even worse than they.

[Jeremiah 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 16:13</span></span>

Will I cast you out of this land - See [Jer
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#015), and [Jer
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#015).

[Jeremiah 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 16:14</span></span>

The Lord liveth, that brought up - See [Isa
43:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#018).

[Jeremiah 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 16:15</span></span>

The land of the north - Chaldea: and their deliverance thence will be as
remarkable as the deliverance of their fathers from the land of Egypt.

[Jeremiah 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 16:16</span></span>

I will send for many fishers - for many hunters - I shall raise up
enemies against them some of whom shall destroy them by wiles, and
others shall ruin them by violence. This seems to be the meaning of
these symbolical fishers and hunters.

[Jeremiah 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 16:18</span></span>

The carcasses of their detestable - things - Either meaning the idols
themselves, which were only carcasses without life; or the sacrifices
which were made to them.

[Jeremiah 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 16:19</span></span>

The Gentiles shall come - Even the days shall come when the Gentiles
themselves, ashamed of their confidence, shall renounce their idols, and
acknowledge that their fathers had believed lies, and worshipped
vanities. This may be a prediction of the calling of the Gentiles by the
Gospel of Christ; if so, it is a light amidst much darkness. In such
dismal accounts there is need of some gracious promise relative to an
amended state of the world.

[Jeremiah 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 16:20</span></span>

Shall a man make gods unto himself? - Can any be so silly, and so
preposterously absurd? Yes, fallen man is capable of any thing that is
base, mean, vile, and wicked, till influenced and converted by the grace
of Christ.

[Jeremiah 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 16:21</span></span>

Therefore, behold, I will this once - I will not now change my purpose.
They shall be visited and carried into captivity; nothing shall prevent
this: and they shall know that my name is Jehovah. Since they would not
receive the abundance of my mercies, they shall know what the true God
can do in the way of judgment.
