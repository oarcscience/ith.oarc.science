### [1 Chronicles Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 19:0</span></span>

David sends a congratulatory message to Hanun, king of Ammon, [Ch1
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#001.md), [Ch1
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#002.md). He treats the messengers with
great incivility, [Ch1 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#003.md), [Ch1
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#004.md). David is exasperated, but
condoles with the degraded messengers, [Ch1
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#005.md). The Ammonites prepare for war,
and hire thirty-two thousand chariots, and besiege Medeba, [Ch1
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#006.md), [Ch1
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#007.md). David sends Joab to attack them;
he defeats the Syrians and Ammonites, [Ch1
19:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#008.md). The discomfited Syrians
recruit their army, and invade David's territories beyond Jordan; he
attacks them, kills Shophach their general, seven thousand charioteers,
and forty thousand of their infantry, [Ch1
19:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#016.md). The Syrians abandon the
Ammonites and make a separate peace with David, [Ch1
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#019.md).

[1 Chronicles 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 19:1</span></span>

Now it came to pass - See the same history, [Sa2
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#001) (note.md), etc., and the notes
there.

[1 Chronicles 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 19:4</span></span>

And cut off their garments in the midst - Usque ad eorum, pudenda. So
the Targum, Jarchi, and others; leaving exposed what nature and decency
require to be concealed. See on [Sa2
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#004) (note.md).

[1 Chronicles 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 19:6</span></span>

Chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia - These are not mentioned in
the parallel place in Samuel; probably they did not arrive till the
Ammonites and their other allies were defeated by the Israelites in the
first battle.

[1 Chronicles 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 19:7</span></span>

Thirty and two thousand - The whole number mentioned in Samuel is,
Syrians, of Beth-rehob, and of Zoba, twenty thousand; of King Maacah,
one thousand; of Ish-tob, twelve thousand; in all thirty-three thousand.
Of chariots or cavalry there is no mention. These could not have been
the whole army.

[1 Chronicles 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch1 19:13</span></span>

Be of good courage - See the note on [Sa2
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#012.md).

[1 Chronicles 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 19:18</span></span>

Forty thousand footmen - See this number accounted for in the note on
[Sa2 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#018) (note.md).

[1 Chronicles 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch1 19:19</span></span>

They made peace with David, and became his servants - See on [Sa2
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#019) (note.md), and the concluding note
in that place; and see for omissions in Chronicles, the preface to these
books.
