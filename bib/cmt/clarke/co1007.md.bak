[1 Corinthians 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 7:1</span></span>

The things whereof ye wrote unto me - It is sufficiently evident that
the principal part of this epistle was written in answer to some
questions which had been sent to the apostle in a letter from the
Corinthian Church; and the first question seems to be this: "Is it
proper for a man to marry in the present circumstances of the Church?"
The question concerning the expediency or inexpediency of marriage was
often agitated among the ancient philosophers; and many, though inclined
to decide against it, because of the troubles and cares connected with
it, tolerated it in their opinions; because, though an evil, it was
judged to be a necessary evil. The words of Menander are full to this
effect: Γαμειν, εαν τις την αληθειαν σκοπῃ, κακον μεν εστιν, αλλ'
αναγκαιον κακον· "If a man consider marriage in a proper point of view,
it is an evil; but then it is a necessary evil." Metellus Numidicus
spoke of it nearly in the same way. Si sine uxore possemus, Quirites,
esse, omnes ea molestia careremus; sed quoniam ita natura tradidit, ut
nec Cum Illis salis commode, nec Sine Illis ullo modo vivi possit,
saluti perpetus potius quam brevi voluptati consulendum. "If, O ye
Romans, we could live unmarried, we should be saved from a great deal of
trouble; but, seeing that nature has so ordered it that we cannot live
very comfortably with wives, and without them cannot live at all,
marriage should be adopted, not for the sake of the short-lived
pleasure, but rather for perpetual safety." But this was not the common
opinion; the Jews absolutely required that every man should marry, and
reputed those as murderers who did not. - See on [Co1
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#006) (note.md). By the laws of Lycurgus
unmarried persons were prohibited from seeing the public games. By the
laws of the Spartans bachelors were punished. And Plato declares all
such unworthy of any honor. And to this the commentator says, Amen.

Not to touch a woman - Γυναικος μη ἁπτεσθαι· The learned reader need not
be informed in what sense ἁπτομαι is used among the Greeks, and langere
among the Latins. For examples Wetstein may be consulted.

[1 Corinthians 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 7:2</span></span>

To avoid fornication - Δια τας πορνειας· verto, propter exercendam
libidinem, vel ut libidinem licite exercere liceat. Probo hanc notionem
ex Hebraeo, ibi זנה, zanah, est libidinem exercere, [Hos
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#010.md) : For they shall eat and not have
enough; they shall commit whoredom, תזנו, libidinem exercebunt, and
shall not increase. Here the prophet certainly does not speak of
whoredom in our sense of the word; for the persons he mentions expected
to have children, which cannot be said of those who are addicted to
improper connections: the prophet speaks concerning married persons,
whom he threatens with a privation of children, notwithstanding
libidinem exercebant in order to have numerous families. See Schoettgen.
The following verse shows that this is the apostle's meaning.

Let every man have his own wife - Let every man have one woman, his own;
and every woman one man, her own. Here, plurality of wives and husbands
is most strictly forbidden; and they are commanded to marry for the
purpose of procreating children.

In the Jewish constitutions there are some things not only curious, but
useful, respecting marriage. "There are four causes which induce men to
marry:

1\. Impure desire;

2\. To get riches;

3\. To become honorable;

4\. For the glory of God.

Those who marry through the first motive beget wicked and rebellious
children. Those who marry for the sake of riches have the curse of
leaving them to others. Those who marry for the sake of aggrandizing
their family, their families shall be diminished. Those who marry to
promote the glory of God, their children shall be holy, and by them
shall the true Church be increased."

[1 Corinthians 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 7:3</span></span>

Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence - Την οφειλομενην
ευνοιαν· Though our version is no translation of the original, yet few
persons are at a loss for the meaning, and the context is sufficiently
plain. Some have rendered the words, not unaptly, the matrimonial debt,
or conjugal duty - that which a wife owes to her husband, and the
husband to his wife; and which they must take care mutually to render,
else alienation of affection will be the infallible consequence, and
this in numberless instances has led to adulterous connections. In such
cases the wife has to blame herself for the infidelity of her husband,
and the husband for that of his wife. What miserable work has been made
in the peace of families by a wife or a husband pretending to be wiser
than the apostle, and too holy and spiritual to keep the commandments of
God!

[1 Corinthians 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 7:4</span></span>

The wife hath not power, etc. - Her person belongs to her husband; her
husband's person belongs to her: neither of them has any authority to
refuse what the other has a matrimonial right to demand. The woman that
would act so is either a knave or a fool. It would be trifling to
attribute her conduct to any other cause than weakness or folly. She
does not love her husband; or she loves some one else better than her
husband; or she makes pretensions to a fancied sanctity unsupported by
Scripture or common sense.

[1 Corinthians 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 7:5</span></span>

Defraud ye not one the other - What ye owe thus to each other never
refuse paying, unless by mutual consent; and let that be only for a
certain time, when prudence dictates the temporary separation, or when
some extraordinary spiritual occasion may render it mutually agreeable,
in order that ye may fast and pray, and derive the greatest possible
benefit from these duties by being enabled to wait on the Lord without
distraction.

That Satan tempt you not for your incontinency - It is most evident that
the separations permitted by the Apostle, for he enjoins none, are only
for a season, on extraordinary occasions; and that the persons may come
together again, lest Satan, taking advantage of their matrimonial
abstinence, might tempt either party to illicit commerce.

There are a multitude of rules prescribed in such cases by the rabbins,
and indeed even by heathen writers; for this was a matter in which
common sense could always judge; and under the direction of experience,
heathens, as well as those favored with Divine revelation, could see
what was proper in all such cases.

Incontinence, εικρασια, want of strength to regulate one's desires or
appetites; from α, negative, and κρατος, strength. It is remarkable that
the apostle supposes that even this temporary continence might produce
incontinence; and universal observation confirms the supposition.

[1 Corinthians 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 7:6</span></span>

I speak this by permission, etc. - It was a constant custom of the more
conscientious rabbins, to make a difference between the things which
they enjoined on their own judgment, and those which they built on the
authority of the law. Thus Rabbi Tancum: "The washing of hands before
meat is in our own power; washing after meat is commanded." In relation
to this point Dr. Lightfoot produces some examples from the Jewish
writers: "The man is commanded concerning begetting and multiplying, but
not the woman. And when does the man come under this command? From the
age of sixteen or seventeen years; but, if he exceeds twenty years
without marrying, behold he violates and renders an affirmative precept
vain. The Gemara says: It is forbidden a man to be without a wife;
because it is written, It is not good for man to be alone. And whosoever
gives not himself to generation and multiplying is all one with a
murderer: he is as though he diminished from the image of God, etc." We
may understand the apostle here as saying that the directions already
given were from his own judgment, and not from any Divine inspiration;
and we may take it for granted that where he does not make this
observation he is writing under the immediate afflatus of the Holy
Spirit.

[1 Corinthians 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 7:7</span></span>

For I would that all men, etc. - He wished that all that were then in
the Church were, like him self, unmarried; but this was in reference to
the necessities of the Church, or what he calls, [Co1
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#026.md), the present distress: for it
never could be his wish that marriage should cease among men, and that
human beings should no longer be propagated upon earth; nor could he
wish that the Church of Christ should always be composed of single
persons; this would have been equally absurd; but as the Church was then
in straits and difficulties, it was much better for its single members
not to encumber themselves with domestic embarrassments.

Every man hath his proper gift of God - Continence is a state that
cannot be acquired by human art or industry; a man has it from God, or
not at all: and if he have it from God, he has it from him as the author
of his nature; for where it does not exist naturally, it never can
exist, but either by miraculous interference, which should never be
expected, or by chirurgical operation, which is a shocking abomination
in the sight of God. See the note on [Mat
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#012) (note.md).

[1 Corinthians 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 7:8</span></span>

The unmarried and widows - It is supposed that the apostle speaks here
of men who had been married, in the word αγαμοι, but were now widowers;
as he does of women who had been married, in the word χηραι, but were
now widows. And when he says ὡς καγω, even as I, he means that he
himself was a widower; for several of the ancients rank Paul among the
married apostles.

[1 Corinthians 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 7:9</span></span>

But if they cannot contain - If they find it inconvenient and
uncomfortable to continue as widowers and widows, let them remarry.

It is better to marry than to burn - Bishop Pearce translates the
original thus: For it is better to marry than to be made uneasy.
Πυρουσθαι, says he, "signifies primarily to burn; but in a metaphorical
sense, to be troubled, vexed, or made uneasy. So in [Co2
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#029.md) : Who is offended and I burn
not, και ουκ εγω πυρουμαι, and I am not troubled. So in Terence, Uro
hominem, is I vex him." It would be well to soften the sense of this
word in reference to the subject of which the apostle speaks. He cannot
mean burning with lust, no more than Virgil means so when he says, Aen.
iv. ver. 68: Uritur infelix Dido, the unfortunate Dido is tormented; and
in Eccl. ii. 68: Me tamen urit amor, love torments me. All this may be
said with the strictest truth in such cases where the impure fire
referred to above has no existence.

A curious story, which certainly casts light on the phraseology of this
place, is related by Dr. Lightfoot, from the tract Kiddushin, fol. 81.
"Some captive women were brought to Nehardea, and disposed in the house
and the upper room of Rabbi Amram. They took away the ladder (that the
women might not get down, but stay there till they were ransomed.) As
one of these captives passed by the window, the light of her great
beauty shined into the house. Amram (captivated) set up the ladder; and
when he was got to the middle of the steps (checked by his conscience)
he stopped short, and with a loud voice cried out Fire! Fire! in the
house of Amram! (This he did that, the neighbors flocking in, he might
be obliged to desist from the evil affection which now prevailed in
him.) The rabbins ran to him, and (seeing no fire) they said, Thou hast
disgraced us. To which he replied: It is better that ye be disgraced in
the house of Amram in this world, then that ye be disgraced by me in the
world to come. He then adjured that evil affection to go out of him, and
it went out as a pillar of Fire. Amram said: Thou art Fire, and I am
Flesh; yet for all that I have prevailed against thee." From this story
much instruction may be derived.

[1 Corinthians 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 7:10</span></span>

I command, yet not I, but the Lord - I do not give my own private
opinion or judgment in this case; for the Lord Jesus commands that man
shall not put asunder them whom God hath joined, [Mat
5:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#032.md); [Mat
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#006.md). And God has said the same, [Gen
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#024.md). The following extracts will
prove that the law among the Jews was very loose relative to the
firmness of the marriage bond: -

A woman might put away or depart from her husband by giving this simple
reason to the elders, who would give the following certificate.

"In \_\_\_\_ day of \_\_\_\_ week, of \_\_\_\_ year, A., daughter of B.,
put away before us and said: My mother, or my brethren, deceived me, and
wedded me or betrothed me, when I was a very young maid, to C., son of
D.; but I now reveal my mind before you, that I will not have him."

Sometimes they parted with mutual consent, and this also was considered
legal, as was also the marriage of the separated parties to others.
Witness the following story: "A good man had a good wife; but because
they had no children, they mutually put away each other. The good man
married a bad (a heathen) wife, and she made him bad (a heathen); the
good woman married a bad (a heathen) husband, and she made him good."
Divorces were easily obtained among them, and they considered them the
dissolving of the marriage bond; and, in consequence of these, the
parties might remarry with others. This was contrary to the original
institution of marriage, and is opposed both by our Lord and the
apostle.

[1 Corinthians 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 7:11</span></span>

But, and if she depart - He puts the case as probable, because it was
frequent, but lays it under restrictions.

Let her remain unmarried - She departs at her own peril; but she must
not marry another: she must either continue unmarried, or be reconciled
to her husband.

And let not the husband put away his wife - Divorces cannot be allowed
but in the case of fornication: an act of this kind dissolves the
marriage vow; but nothing else can. It is a fact that, among the Jews,
the wife had just as much right to put away her husband as the husband
had to put away his wife. As divorces were granted, it was right that
each should have an equal power; for this served as a mutual check.

[1 Corinthians 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 7:12</span></span>

But to the rest speak I, not the Lord - As if he had said: For what I
have already spoken I have the testimony of the Lord by Moses, and of my
own Lord and Master, Christ; but for the directions which I am now about
to give there is no written testimony, and I deliver them now for the
first time. These words do not intimate that the apostle was not now
under the influences of the Divine Spirit; but, that there was nothing
in the sacred writings which bore directly on this point.

If any brother - A Christian man, have a wife that believeth not, i.e.
who is a heathen, not yet converted to the Christian faith, and she be
pleased to dwell with him, notwithstanding his turning Christian since
their marriage, let him not put her away because she still continues in
her heathen superstition.

[1 Corinthians 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 7:13</span></span>

And the woman - Converted from heathenism to the Christian faith; which
hath a husband, who still abides in heathenism; if he be pleased to
dwell with her, notwithstanding she has become a Christian since their
marriage; let her not leave him because he still continues a heathen.

[1 Corinthians 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co1 7:14</span></span>

The unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife - Or rather, is to be
reputed as sanctified on account of his wife; she being a Christian
woman, and he, though a heathen, being by marriage one flesh with her:
her sanctity, as far as it refers to outward things, may be considered
as imputed to him so as to render their connection not unlawful. The
case is the same when the wife is a heathen and the husband a Christian.
The word sanctification here is to be applied much more to the Christian
state than to any moral change in the persons; for ἁγιοι, saints, is a
common term for Christians - those who were baptized into the faith of
Christ; and as its corresponding term קדושים kedoshim signified all the
Jews who were in the covenant of God by circumcision, the heathens in
question were considered to be in this holy state by means of their
connection with those who were by their Christian profession saints.

Else were your children unclean - If this kind of relative
sanctification were not allowed, the children of these persons could not
be received into the Christian Church, nor enjoy any rights, or
privileges as Christians; but the Church of God never scrupled to admit
such children as members, just as well as she did those who had sprung
from parents both of whom were Christians.

The Jews considered a child as born out of holiness whose parents were
not proselytes at the time of the birth, though afterwards they became
proselytes. On the other hand, they considered the children of heathens
born in holiness, provided the parents became proselytes before the
birth. All the children of the heathens were reputed unclean by the
Jews; and all their own children holy. - See Dr. Lightfoot. This shows
clearly what the apostle's meaning is.

If we consider the apostle as speaking of the children of heathens, we
shall get a remarkable comment on this passage from Tertullian, who, in
his treatise De Carne Christi, chaps. 37, 39, gives us a melancholy
account of the height to which superstition and idolatry had arrived in
his time among the Romans. "A child," says he, "from its very
conception, was dedicated to the idols and demons they worshipped. While
pregnant, the mother had her body swathed round with bandages, prepared
with idolatrous rites. The embryo they conceived to be under the
inspection of the goddess Alemona, who nourished it in the womb. Nona
and Decima took care that it should be born in the ninth or tenth month.
Partula adjusted every thing relative to the labor; and Lucina ushered
it into the light. During the week preceding the birth a table was
spread for Juno; and on the last day certain persons were called
together to mark the moment on which the Parcae, or Fates, had fixed its
destiny. The first step the child set on the earth was consecrated to
the goddess Statina; and, finally, some of the hair was cut off, or the
whole head shaven, and the hair offered to some god or goddess through
some public or private motive of devotion." He adds that "no child among
the heathens was born in a state of purity; and it is not to be wondered
at," says he, "that demons possess them from their youth, seeing they
were thus early dedicated to their service." In reference to this, he
thinks, St. Paul speaks in the verse before us: The unbelieving husband
is sanctified by the wife - else were your children unclean; but now are
they holy; i.e. "As the parents were converted to the Christian faith,
the child comes into the world without these impure and unhallowed
rites; and is from its infancy consecrated to the true God."

[1 Corinthians 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co1 7:15</span></span>

But if the unbelieving, depart - Whether husband or wife: if such
obstinately depart and utterly refuse all cohabitation, a brother or a
sister - a Christian man or woman, is not under bondage to any
particular laws, so as to be prevented from remarrying. Such, probably,
the law stood then; but it is not so now; for the marriage can only be
dissolved by death, or by the ecclesiastical court. Even fornication or
adultery does not dissolve the marriage contract; nor will the obstinate
separation of any of the parties, however long continued, give the party
abandoned authority to remarry. If the person have been beyond sea, and
not heard of for seven years, it is presumed he may be dead; and
marriage has been connived at in such cases. If there be no person to
complain, it may be presumed that there is none injured. But I have
known instances where even a marriage after seven years' absence has
been very unfortunate; the husband returning at the end of ten or twelve
years, and to his utter distress finding his wife married to another
man, and with issue of that marriage! There can be no safety in this
case, unless there be absolute certainty of the death of the party in
question.

God hath called us to peace - The refractory and disagreeing party
should not be compelled to fulfill such matrimonial engagements as would
produce continual jarring and discord. At the same time each should take
care that he give no cause for disagreements and separations, for the
author of the Christian religion is the author of peace, and has called
us to it.

[1 Corinthians 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co1 7:16</span></span>

For what knowest thou, O wife - You that are Christians, and who have
heathen partners, do not give them up because they are such, for you may
become the means of saving them unto eternal life. Bear your cross, and
look up to God, and he may give your unbelieving husband or wife to your
prayers.

[1 Corinthians 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co1 7:17</span></span>

But as God hath distributed to every man, etc. - Let every man fulfill
the duties of the state to which God in the course of his providence has
called him.

So ordain I in all Churches - I do not lay on you a burden which others
are not called to bear: this is the general rule which, by the authority
of God, I impose on every Christian society.

[1 Corinthians 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co1 7:18</span></span>

Is any man called being circumcised? - Is any man who was formerly a Jew
converted to Christianity?

Let him not become circumcised - Let him not endeavor to abolish the
sign of the old covenant, which he bears in his flesh. The Greek words
μη επισπασθω, let him not draw over, are evidently an elliptical
expression: the word την ακροβυστιαν, the fore-skin, being understood;
which, indeed, is added by the Armenian and the Itala, and several of
the Latin fathers. It is a fact that it was possible by the assistance
of art to do this; and Celsus himself prescribes the mode, De Medic.
vii. 25. By frequent stretching, the circumcised skin could be again so
drawn over, as to prevent the ancient sign of circumcision from
appearing. Some in their zeal against Judaism endeavored to abolish this
sign of it in their flesh: it is most evidently against this that the
apostle speaks. Many false Jews made use of this practice, that they
might pass through heathen countries unobserved; otherwise, in
frequenting the baths they would have been detected.

Let him not be circumcised - Let no man who, being a Gentile, has been
converted to the Christian faith, submit to circumcision as something
necessary to his salvation.

[1 Corinthians 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co1 7:19</span></span>

Circumcision is nothing - Circumcision itself, though commanded of God,
is nothing of itself, it being only a sign of the justification which
should be afterwards received by faith. At present, neither it nor its
opposite either hinders or furthers the work of grace; and keeping the
commandments of God, from his love shed abroad in a believing heart, is
the sum and substance of religion.

[1 Corinthians 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co1 7:20</span></span>

Let every man abide in the same calling - As both the circumcised and
uncircumcised, in Christ, have the same advantages, and to their
believing the same facilities; so any situation of life is equally
friendly to the salvation of the soul, if a man be faithful to the grace
he has received. Therefore, in all situations a Christian should be
content, for all things work together for good to him who loves God.

[1 Corinthians 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co1 7:21</span></span>

Art thou called being a servant? - Δουλος εκληθης, Art thou converted to
Christ while thou art a slave - the property of another person, and
bought with his money? care not for it - this will not injure thy
Christian condition, but if thou canst obtain thy liberty - use it
rather - prefer this state for the sake of freedom, and the temporal
advantages connected with it.

[1 Corinthians 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">co1 7:22</span></span>

For he that is called - The man who, being a slave, is converted to the
Christian faith, is the Lord's freeman; his condition as a slave does
not vitiate any of the privileges to which he is entitled as a
Christian: on the other hand, all free men, who receive the grace of
Christ, must consider themselves the slaves of the Lord, i.e. his real
property, to be employed and disposed of according to his godly wisdom,
who, notwithstanding their state of subjection, will find the service of
their Master to be perfect freedom.

[1 Corinthians 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">co1 7:23</span></span>

Ye are bought with a price - As truly as your bodies have become the
property of your masters, in consequence of his paying down a price for
you; so sure you are now the Lord's property, in consequence of your
being purchased by the blood of Christ.

Some render this verse interrogatively: Are ye bought with a price from
your slavery? Do not again become slaves of men. Never sell yourselves;
prefer and retain your liberty now that ye have acquired it.

In these verses the apostle shows that the Christian religion does not
abolish our civil connections; in reference to them, where it finds us,
there it leaves us. In whatever relation we stood before our embracing
Christianity, there we stand still; our secular condition being no
farther changed than as it may be affected by the amelioration of our
moral character. But slavery, and all buying and selling of the bodies
and souls of men, no matter what color or complexion, is a high offense
against the holy and just God, and a gross and unprincipled attack on
the liberty and rights of our fellow creatures.

[1 Corinthians 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">co1 7:24</span></span>

Let every man - abide with God - Let him live to God in whatsoever
station he is placed by Providence. If he be a slave, God will be with
him even in his slavery, if he be faithful to the grace which he has
received. It is very likely that some of the slaves at Corinth, who had
been converted to Christianity, had been led to think that their
Christian privileges absolved them from the necessity of continuing
slaves; or, at least, brought them on a level with their Christian
masters. A spirit of this kind might have soon led to confusion and
insubordination, and brought scandals into the Church. It was therefore
a very proper subject for the apostle to interfere in; and to his
authority, the persons concerned would doubtless respectfully bow.

[1 Corinthians 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">co1 7:25</span></span>

Now concerning virgins - This was another subject on which the Church at
Corinth had asked the advice of the apostle. The word παρθενος, virgin,
we take to signify a pure, unmarried young woman; but it is evident that
the word in this place means young unmarried persons of either sex, as
appears from [Co1 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#026.md), [Co1
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#027.md), [Co1
7:32-34](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#032.md), and from [Rev
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#004.md). The word παρθενος, virgin, is
frequently applied to men as well as to women. See Suidas, under the
word Αβελ· οὑτος παρθενος και δι καιος ὑπηρχε, He (Abel) was a virgin,
and a righteous man. In [Co1 7:36](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#036.md) the
word is supposed to mean the state of virginity or celibacy, and very
probable reasons are assigned for it; and it is evident that persons of
either sex in a state of celibacy are the persons intended.

I have no commandment of the Lord - There is nothing in the sacred
writings that directly touches this point.

Yet I give my judgment - As every way equal to such commandments had
there been any, seeing I have received the teaching of his own Spirit,
and have obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful to this heavenly
gift, so that it abides with me to lead me into all truth. In this way I
think the apostle's words may be safely understood.

[1 Corinthians 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">co1 7:26</span></span>

This is good for the present distress - There was no period in the
heathen times when the Church was not under persecutions and
afflictions; on some occasions these were more oppressive than at
others.

The word αναγκη signifies, necessity, distress, tribulation, and
calamity; as it does in [Luk 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#023.md);
[Co2 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#004.md); [Co2
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#010.md). In such times, when the people
of God had no certain dwelling-place, when they were lying at the mercy
of their enemies without any protection from the state - the state
itself often among the persecutors - he who had a family to care for,
would find himself in very embarrassed circumstances, as it would be
much more easy to provide for his personal safety than to have the care
of a wife and children. On this account it was much better for unmarried
persons to continue for the present in their celibacy.

[1 Corinthians 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">co1 7:27</span></span>

Art thou bound unto a wife? - i.e. Married; for the marriage contract
was considered in the light of a bond.

Seek not to be loosed - Neither regret your circumstances,
notwithstanding the present distress, nor seek on this account for a
dissolution of the marriage contract. But if thou art under no
matrimonial engagements, do not for the present enter into any.

[1 Corinthians 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">co1 7:28</span></span>

But, and if thou marry - As there is no law against this, even in the
present distress, thou hast not sinned, because there is no law against
this; and it is only on account of prudential reasons that I give this
advice.

And if a virgin marry - Both the man and the woman have equal privileges
in this case; either of them may marry without sin. It is probable, as
there were many sects and parties in Corinth, that there were among them
those who forbade to marry, [Ti1 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#003.md),
and who might have maintained other doctrines of devils besides. These
persons, or such doctrines, the apostle has in view when he says, They
may marry and yet not sin.

Trouble in the flesh - From the simple circumstance of the incumbrance
of a family while under persecution; because of the difficulty of
providing for its comfort and safety while flying before the face of
persecution.

But I spare you - The evil is coming; but I will not press upon you the
observance of a prudential caution, which you might deem too heavy a
cross.

[1 Corinthians 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">co1 7:29</span></span>

The time is short - These persecutions and distresses are at the door,
and life itself will soon be run out. Even then Nero was plotting those
grievous persecutions with which he not only afflicted, but devastated
the Church of Christ.

They that have wives - Let none begin to think of any comfortable
settlement for his family, let him sit loose to all earthly concerns,
and stand ready prepared to escape for his life, or meet death, as the
providence of God may permit. The husband will be dragged from the side
of his wife to appear before the magistrates, and be required either to
abjure Christ or die.

Linquenda tellus, et domus, et placens

Uxor; neque harum, quas colis, arborum

Te, praeter invisas cupressos,

Ulla brevem dominum sequetur.

Hor. Odar. lib. ii., Od. xiv., v. 22.

Your pleasing consort must be left;

And you, of house and lands bereft,

Must to the shades descend:

The cypress only, hated tree!

Of all thy much-loved groves, shall thee,

Its short-lived lord, attend.

Francis.

Poor heathenism! thou couldst give but cold comfort in such
circumstances as these: and infidelity, thy younger brother, is no
better provided than thou.

[1 Corinthians 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">co1 7:30</span></span>

They that weep, etc. - There will shortly be such a complete system of
distress and confusion that private sorrows and private joys will be
absorbed in the weightier and more oppressive public evils: yet, let
every man still continue in his calling, let him buy, and sell, and
traffic, as usual; though in a short time, either by the coming
persecution or the levelling hand of death, he that had earthly property
will be brought into the same circumstances with him who had none.

[1 Corinthians 7:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">co1 7:31</span></span>

And they that use this world - Let them who have earthly property or
employments discharge conscientiously their duties, from a conviction of
the instability of earthly things. Make a right use of every thing, and
pervert nothing from its use. To use a thing is to employ it properly in
order to accomplish the end to which it refers. To abuse a thing
signifies to pervert it from that use. Pass through things temporal, so
as not to lose those which are eternal.

For the fashion of this world - Το σχημα του κοσμον τουτου signifies
properly the present state or constitution of things; the frame of the
world, that is, the world itself. But often the term κοσμος, world, is
taken to signify the Jewish state and polity; the destruction of this
was then at hand, and this the Holy Spirit might then signify to the
apostle.

[1 Corinthians 7:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">co1 7:32</span></span>

Without carefulness - Though all these things will shortly come to pass,
yet do not be anxious about them. Every occurrence is under the
direction and management of God. The wrath of man shall praise him, and
the remainder of it he shall restrain, and none can harm you if ye be
followers of that which is good. We should all take the advice of the
poet: -

"With patient mind thy course of duty run;

God nothing does, nor suffers to be done,

But thou wouldst do thyself, couldst thou but see

The end of all events as well as He."

Byrom.

He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord - He
has nothing to do with a family, and therefore can give his whole time
to the service of his Maker, having him alone to please.

[1 Corinthians 7:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">co1 7:33</span></span>

But he that is married - He has a family to provide for, and his wife to
please, as well as to fulfill his duty to God, and attend to the
concerns of his own soul. The single man has nothing to attend to but
what concerns his own salvation: the married man has all this to attend
to, and besides to provide for his wife and family, and take care of
their eternal interests also. The single man has very little trouble
comparatively; the married man has a great deal. The single man is an
atom in society; the married man is a small community in himself. The
former is the centre of his own existence, and lives for himself alone;
the latter is diffused abroad, makes a much more important part of the
body social, and provides both for its support and continuance. The
single man lives for and does good to himself only; the married man
lives both for himself and the public. Both the state and the Church of
Christ are dependent on the married man, as from him under God the one
has subjects, the other members; while the single man is but an
individual in either, and by and by will cease from both, and having no
posterity is lost to the public for ever. The married man, therefore,
far from being in a state of inferiority to the single man, is beyond
him out of the limits of comparison. He can do all the good the other
can do, though perhaps sometimes in a different way; and he can do ten
thousand goods that the other cannot possibly do. And therefore both
himself and his state are to be preferred infinitely before those of the
other. Nor could the apostle have meant any thing less; only for the
present distress he gave his opinion that it was best for those who were
single to continue so. And who does not see the propriety of the advice?

[1 Corinthians 7:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">co1 7:34</span></span>

There is a difference also between a wife and a virgin - That is: There
is this difference between a married and an unmarried woman. The
unmarried careth (only) for the things of the Lord, having no domestic
duties to perform. That she may be holy - separated to Divine
employments, both in body and spirit. Whereas she that is married careth
(also) for the things of the world, how she may please her husband,
having many domestic duties to fulfill, her husband being obliged to
leave to her the care of the family, and all other domestic concerns.

On this verse there is a profusion of various readings in MSS.,
versions, and fathers, for which I must refer to Griesbach, as it would
be impossible to introduce them here so as to make them look like sense.

[1 Corinthians 7:35](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">co1 7:35</span></span>

This I speak for your own profit - The advices belong to yourselves
alone, because of the peculiar circumstances in which you are placed.
Nothing spoken here was ever designed to be of general application; it
concerned the Church at Corinth alone, or Churches in similar
circumstances.

Not that I may cast a snare upon you - Ουχ ἱνα βροχον ὑμιν επιβαλω -
Here is a manifest allusion to the Retiarius among the Romans, who
carried a small casting net, which he endeavored to throw over the head
of his adversary and thus entangle him. Or to a similar custom among the
Persians, who made use of a noose called the camand; which they employed
in the same way. One of these lies before me; it is a strong silken
cord, one end of which is a loop to be held in the hand, and the rest is
in the form of a common snare or noose, which, catching hold of any
thing, tightens in proportion as it is pulled by the hand that holds the
loop.

The apostle, therefore, intimates that what he says was not intended
absolutely to bind them, but to show them the propriety of following an
advice which in the present case would be helpful to them in their
religious connections, that they might attend upon the Lord without
distraction, which they could not do in times of persecution, when, in
addition to their own personal safety, they had a wife and children to
care for.

For that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without
distraction , - The original αλλα προς το ευσχημον και ευπροσεδρον τῳ
Κυριῳ απερισπαστως, of which our version is only a paraphrase, is thus
translated by Bishop Pearson: But for the sake of decency, and of
attending more easily upon the Lord without distraction. This is much
more literal than ours.

[1 Corinthians 7:36](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">co1 7:36</span></span>

Uncomely towards his virgin - Different meanings have been assigned to
this verse; I shall mention three of the principal.

1\. "In those early times, both among the Hebrews and Christians, the
daughters were wholly in the power of the father, so that he might give
or not give them in marriage as he chose; and might bind them to
perpetual celibacy if he thought proper; and to this case the apostle
alludes. If the father had devoted his daughter to perpetual virginity,
and he afterwards found that she had fixed her affections upon a person
whom she was strongly inclined to marry, and was now getting past the
prime of life; he, seeing from his daughter's circumstances that it
would be wrong to force her to continue in her state of celibacy; though
he had determined before to keep her single, yet he might in this case
alter his purpose without sin, and let her and her suitor marry."

2\. "The whole verse and its context speaks of young women dedicated to
the service of God, who were called παρθενοι, virgins, in the primitive
Church. And a case is put here, 'that circumstances might occur to
render the breach of even a vow of this kind necessary, and so no sin be
committed.'"

3\. "The apostle by παρθενος, does not mean a virgin, but the state of
virginity or celibacy, whether in man or woman." Both Mr. Locke and Dr.
Whitby are of this opinion, and the latter reasons on it thus: -

It is generally supposed that these three verses relate to virgins under
the power of parents and guardians and the usual inference is, that
children are to be disposed of in marriage by the parents, guardians,
etc. Now this may be true, but it has no foundation in the text, for
τηρειν την ἑαυτου παρθενον is not to keep his daughter's, but his own
virginity, or rather his purpose of virginity; for, as Phavorinus says,
He is called a virgin who freely gives himself up to the Lord,
renouncing matrimony, and preferring a life spent in continency. And
that this must be the true import of these words appears from this
consideration, that this depends upon the purpose of his own heart, and
the power he has over his own will, and the no necessity arising from
himself to change this purpose. Whereas the keeping a daughter unmarried
depends not on these conditions on her father's part but on her own;
for, let her have a necessity, and surely the apostle would not advise
the father to keep her a virgin, because he had determined so to do; nor
could there be any doubt whether the father had power over his own will
or not, when no necessity lay upon him to betroth his virgin. The Greek
runs to this sense: if he had stood already firm in his heart, finding
no necessity, viz. to change his purpose; and hath power over his own
will, not to marry; finding himself able to persist in the resolution he
had made to keep his virginity, he does well to continue a virgin: and
then the phrase, if any man think he behaves himself unseemly towards
his virgin, if it be over-aged, and thinks he ought rather to join in
marriage, refers to the opinions both of Jews and Gentiles that all
ought to marry. The Jews say that the time of marriage is from 16 or 17
to 20; while some of the Gentiles specify from 30 to 35. If any think
thus, says the apostle, let them do what they will, they sin not: let
them marry. And then he concludes with those words applied to both
cases: so then, both he that marries doeth well, and he that marries
not, doeth better.

This last opinion seems to be the true sense of the apostle.

It may be necessary to make a few general observations on these verses,
summing up what has been said.

1\. Παρθενος here should be considered as implying not a virgin, but the
state of virginity or celibacy.

2\. Ὑπερακμος, over-aged, must refer to the passing of that time in
which both the laws and customs of Jews and Gentiles required men to
marry. See above, and see the note on [Co1
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#006.md).

3\. Και οὑτως οφειλει γινεσθαι, And need so require; or, if there appear
to be a necessity; is to be understood of any particular change in his
circumstances or in his feelings; or, that he finds, from the law and
custom in the case, that it is a scandal for him not to marry; then let
him do what he wills or purposes.

4\. Instead of γαμειτωσαν, let Them marry, I think γαμειτω, let Him
marry, is the true reading, and agrees best with the context. This
reading is supported by D\*EFG, Syriac, in the Arabic, Slavonic, one of
the Itala, and St. Augustine. Si nubat, if he marry, is the reading of
the Vulgate, several copies of the Itala, Ambrose, Jerome, Ambrosiaster,
Sedulius, and Bede. This reading is nearly of the same import with the
other: Let him do what he willeth, he sinneth not, let him marry; or, he
sinneth not if he marry.

5\. The whole of the 37th verse relates to the purpose that the man has
formed; and the strength that he has to keep his purpose of perpetual
celibacy, being under no necessity to change that purpose.

6\. Instead of ὁ εκγαμιζων, he who giveth her in marriage, I purpose to
read ὁ γαμιζων, he who marrieth, which is the reading of the Codex
Alexandrinus, the Codex Vaticanus, No. 1209, and of some others: with
Clement, Methodius, and Basil. Την ἑαυτου παρθενον, his own virgin, is
added after the above, by several very ancient and reputable MSS, as
also by the Syriac, Armenian, Vulgate, Ethiopic, Clement, Basil,
Optatus, and others; but it seems so much like a gloss, that Griesbach
has not made it even a candidate for a place in the text. He then who
marrieth, though previously intending perpetual virginity, doeth well;
as this is agreeable to laws both Divine and human: and he who marrieth
not, doeth better, because of the present distress. See [Co1
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#026.md).

[1 Corinthians 7:39](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">co1 7:39</span></span>

The wife is bound by the law - This seems to be spoken in answer to some
other question of the Corinthians to this effect: "May a woman remarry
whose husband is dead, or who has abandoned her?" To which he replies,
in general, That as long as her husband is living the law binds her to
him alone; but, if the husband die, she is free to remarry, but only in
the Lord; that is she must not marry a heathen nor an irreligious man;
and she should not only marry a genuine Christian, but one of her own
religious sentiments; for, in reference to domestic peace, much depends
on this.

[1 Corinthians 7:40](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">co1 7:40</span></span>

But she is happier if she so abide - If she continue in her widowhood
because of the present distress; for this must always be taken in, that
consistency in the apostle's reasoning may be preserved. If this were
not understood, how could St. Paul tell the widow that it would be more
happy for her to continue in her widowhood than to remarry? She who had
tried both the state of celibacy and the state of marriage could
certainly best tell which was most for her comfort; and he could not
tell any thing but by an express revelation from heaven, relative to the
future state of any widow: it is certain that he can never be understood
as speaking in general, as there are multitudes of persons abundantly
more happy in their married than in their single state; and there are
many widows also much more happy in their second marriage than they have
been in their first.

After my judgment - According to the view I have of the subject, which
view I take by the light of the Divine Spirit, who shows me the
tribulations which are coming on the Church. But, says he, [Co1
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#028.md) : I spare you - I will not be
more explicit concerning coming evils, as I wish to save you from all
forebodings which bring torment.

I think - I have the Spirit of God - Δοκω δε κᾳγω Πνευμα Θεου εχειν
might be translated, I am Certain that I have the Spirit of God. This
sense of δοκειν (which we translate to seem, to think, to appear, etc.)
I have noticed in another part of this work. Ulpian, on Demosthen.
Olynth. 1, says, Το δοκειν ου παντως επι αμφιβολου ταττουσιν οἱ παλαιοι
αλλα πολλακις και επι του αληθευειν· The word δοκειν is used by the
ancients, not always to express what is Doubtful, but often to express
what is True and Certain. - See Bp. Pearce. The apostle cannot be
understood as expressing any doubt of his being under the inspiration of
the Divine Spirit, as this would have defeated his object in giving the
above advices; for if they were not dictated by the Spirit of God, can
it be supposed that, in the face of apparent self-interest, and the
prevalence of strong passions, they could have been expected to have
become rules of conduct to this people? They must have understood him as
asserting that he had the direction of the Spirit of God in giving those
opinions, else they could not be expected to obey.

1\. In the preceding chapter we have met with subjects both of
difficulty and importance. As to the difficulties, it is hoped that they
have been so generally considered in the notes that few or none of them
remain; and on the subjects of peculiar importance much time has been
spent, in order to impress them on the mind of the reader. The delicacy
of some of them would not admit of greater plainness; and in a few
instances I have been obliged to wrap the meaning in a foreign language.

2\. On the important subject of marriage I have said what I believe to
be true, and scruple not to say that it is the most useful state in
which - the human being can be placed; and consequently that in which
most honor may be brought to God. I have listened with much attention
for the better part of half a century to the arguments against marriage
and in favor of celibacy; and I have had the opportunity of being
acquainted with many who endeavored to exemplify their own doctrine. But
I have seen an end of all their perfection: neither the world nor the
Church are under any obligations to them: they either married when they
could do it to their mind and convenience; or, continuing in their
celibacy, they lived a comparatively useless life; and died as they
should, unregretted. The doctrine is not only dangerous but
anti-scriptural: and I hope I have sufficiently vindicated Paul from
being its patron or supporter.

3\. While I contend for the superior excellence of the marriage state, I
hope I shall not be understood to be the apologist of indiscriminate
marriages - no, many of them are blamable in a very high degree. Instead
of consulting common sense and propriety, childish affections, brutish
passions, or the love of money are the motives on which many of them
have been contracted. Such marriages are miserable; must be so, and
should not be otherwise; and superficial people looking at these form an
estimate of the state itself, and then indulge themselves in exclaiming
against an ordinance of God, either perverted by themselves or the
equally foolish persons who are the subjects of their animadversion.
That genuine Christians can never be so useful in any state as that of
marriage I am fully convinced; but to be happy, the marriage must be in
the Lord. When believers match with unbelievers, generally pars sincera
trahitur; the good becomes perverted; and Satan has his triumph when he
has got an immortal soul out of the Church of Christ into his own
synagogue. But who among young people will lay this to heart? And how
few among young men and young women will not sell their Savior and his
people for a husband or a wife!

4\. The doctrine of second marriages has been long a subject of
controversy in the Church. The Scriptures, properly understood, have not
only nothing against them, but much for them. And in this chapter St.
Paul, in the most pointed manner, admits of them. A widow may marry
again, only let it be in the Lord; and a widower has certainly the same
privilege.

5\. The conversion which the Scripture requires, though it makes a most
essential change in our souls in reference to God, and in our works in
reference both to God and man, makes none in our civil state: even if a
man is called, i.e. converted in a state of slavery, he does not gain
his manumission in consequence of his conversion; he stands in the same
relation both to the state and to his fellows that he stood in before;
and is not to assume any civil rights or privileges in consequence of
the conversion of his soul to God. The apostle decides the matter in
this chapter, and orders that every man should abide in the calling
wherein he is called.

6\. From the 20th to the 23rd verse the apostle refers to the state of
slavery among the Greeks; and from what he says we find that even among
the slaves there were Christian converts, to whom, though he recommends
submission and contentment, yet he intimates that if they could get
their freedom they should prefer it; and he strongly charges those that
were free not to become again the slaves of men, [Co1
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#023.md); from which we learn that a man
might dispose of his own liberty, which, in a Christian, would be a
disgrace to his redemption by Christ. The word ελευθερος, which we
translate freeman, means properly freed-man, one who had been a slave
but had regained his liberty. It is the same as libertus among the
Romans, one who was manumitted. The manumission was performed three
several ways:

1\. The consent of the master that the slave should have his name
entered in the census; or public register of the citizens.

2\. The slave was led before the praetor, and the magistrate laid his
wand, called vindicta, on his head, and declared him free.

3\. By testament or will, the master bequeathing to the slave his
freedom. The manner in which the second mode of manumission was
performed is curious. The praetor having laid the rod vindicta upon the
slave's head, pronounced these words, Dico eum liberum esse more
Quiritum, "I pronounce him free according to the custom of the Romans."
This done he gave the rod to the lictor, or serjeant, who struck the
slave with it upon the head, and afterwards with the hand upon the face
and back. The head also of the slave was shaven, and a cup given him by
his master as a token of freedom, and the notary entered the name of the
new freed-man in the public register, with the reasons of his
manumission: it was customary also to give him another surname.

7\. Among our Saxon ancestors, and also after the conquest, there was a
species of slavery: all the villani were slaves to their respective
lords, and each was bound to serve him in a great variety of ways. There
is a profusion of curious examples of this in the ancient record
preserved in the bishop's auditor's office in the cathedral of Durham,
commonly known by the name of the Bolden Book. This record has been
lately printed under the direction of his majesty's commissioners on the
public records of the kingdom, in the supplement to Domesday Book.

8\. Among our Saxon ancestors manumissions were granted on various
accounts:

1\. A person might, if able, purchase his own freedom.

2\. One man might purchase the freedom of another.

3\. Manumissions were granted to procure by their merit the salvation of
departed souls.

4\. Persons were manumitted also in order to be consecrated to the
service of God. These manumissions were usually recorded in some
holybook, especially in copies of the four Evangelists, which, being
preserved in the libraries of abbeys, etc., were a continual record, and
might at all convenient times be consulted. Several entries of these
manumissions exist in a MS. of the four Evangelists, s. 4, 14, in the
library of Corpus Christi or Bennet college, Cambridge.

I shall produce a specimen of one of the several kinds mentioned above,
giving the original only of the first; and of the others, verbal
translations.

1\. The certificate of a man's having purchased his own freedom.

"Here is witnessed, in this book of Christ, that Aelfwig the Red hath
redeemed himself from Abbot Aelfsig, and the whole convent, with one
pound. And this is witnessed by the whole convent at Bath.

May Christ strike him blind

Who this writing perverts."

This is a usual execration at the end of these forms, and is in rhyme in
the original.

2\. Certificate of one having purchased the liberty of another.

"Here is witnessed, in this book of Christ, that Aedric Atford has
redeemed Saegyfa, his daughter, from the Abbot Aelfsig, and from the
convent of Bath, to be for ever free, and all her posterity."

3\. Certificate of redemption in behalf of one departed.

"Here is witnessed, in this book of Christ, that Aelfric Scot and
Aegelric Scot are manumitted for the soul of Abbot Aelfsig, to perpetual
liberty. This was done with the testimony of the whole convent."

4\. Certificate of persons manumitted to be devoted to the service of
God.

"Here is witnessed, in this book of Christ, that John bought Gunnilda
the daughter of Thurkill, from Goda, widow of Leafenath, with half a
pound. With the testimony of the whole convent.

May Christ strike him blind

Who this writing perverts.

And he has dedicated her to Christ and St. Peter, in behalf of his
mother's soul."

9\. When a man was made free, it was either in the church or at some
public meeting: the sheriff of the county took him by the right hand and
proclaimed him a freeman, and showed him the open door and the public
highway, intimating that he was free to go whithersoever he pleased, and
then gave him the arms of a freeman, viz. a spear and a sword. In some
cases the man was to pay thirty pence to his master of hide money,
intimating that he was no longer under restraint, chastisement, or
correction. From which it appears that our ancestors were in the habit
of flogging their slaves. See the laws of Ina, c. 24, 39; of Wm. the
Conqueror, c. 65; and of Hen. I. c. 78.

10\. Among the Gentoos the manumission of a slave was as follows: The
slave took a pitcher, filled it with water, and put therein
berenge-arook (rice that had been cleansed without boiling) and flowers
of doob, (a kind of small salad), and taking the pitcher on his shoulder
he stands near his master; the master then puts the pitcher on the
slave's head, breaks it so that the water, rice, flowers, and doob that
were in the pitcher may fall on the slave's body: when this is done the
master thrice pronounces, I have made thee free; then the slave steps
forward a few paces towards the east, and then the manumission is
complete. See Code of Gentoo laws, chap. 8: sec. 2, page 160. It is
evident that the whole of this ceremony is emblematical:

1\. The pitcher represents the confined, servile state of the slave.

2\. The articles contained in it, his exclusion while in a state of
slavery from the grand benefits and comforts of life.

3\. The water contained in the pitcher, his exclusion from the
refreshing influences of heaven; for slaves were not permitted to take
part in the ordinances of religion.

4\. The clean, unboiled rice, his incapacity to have secular
possessions; for slaves were not permitted to possess lands either by
inheritance or purchase: a slave could sow no seed for himself, and
consequently have no legal claim on support from this staff of life.

5\. The doob or salad shut up, his being without relish for that state
of being which was rendered insupportable to him by his thraldom.

6\. The breaking of the pitcher, his manumission and enjoyment of
liberty: being as free to go whithersoever he would as the water was to
run, being now disengaged from the pitcher.

7\. The shedding of the water, rice, flower, etc., over his body, his
privilege of enjoying and possessing every heavenly and earthly good.

8\. His stepping towards the east, his acknowledgment to the supreme
Being, the fountain of light and life, (of whom the sun was the emblem),
for his enlargement; and his eagerness to possess the light and comfort
of that new state of happiness into which he was now brought in
consequence of his manumission.

11\. The description that Dr. John Taylor gives, in his Elements of
Civil Law, of the state of slaves among the ancients, will nearly suit
with their state among our ancestors, though scarcely as bad as their
state in the West Indies. "They were held among the Romans, pro nullis;
pro mortuis; pro quadrupedibus: - for no men; for dead men; for beasts:
nay, were in a much worse state than any cattle whatever. They had no
head in the state, no name, no tribe or register. They were not capable
of being injured, nor could they take by purchase or descent, had no
heirs, and could make no will. Exclusive of what was called their
peculium, whatever they acquired was their master's; they could neither
plead nor be impleaded; but were entirely excluded from all civil
concerns; were not entitled to the rights of matrimony, and therefore
had no relief in case of adultery; nor were they proper objects of
cognation or affinity. They might be sold, transferred, or pawned, like
other goods or personal estate; for goods they were, and such were they
esteemed. They might be tortured for evidence, punished at the
discretion of their lord, and even put to death, by his authority. They
were laid under several other civil incapacities, too tedious to
mention." When all this is considered, we may at once see the horrible
evil of slavery, and wonder at the grace which could render them happy
and contented in this situation see the preceding chapter, [Co1
7:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#020.md). And yet we need not be
surprised that the apostle should say to those who were free or freed,
Ye are bought with a price; do not become slaves of men.

12\. I have entered the more particularly into this subject, because it,
or allusions to it, are frequently occurring in the New Testament, and I
speak of it here once for all. And, to conclude, I here register my
testimony against the unprincipled, inhuman, anti-Christian, and
diabolical slave-trade, with all its authors, promoters, abettors, and
sacrilegious gains; as well as against the great devil, the father of it
and them.
