### [Psalms Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 24:0</span></span>

The Lord is Sovereign Ruler of the universe, [Psa
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001.md), [Psa
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#002.md). The great question, Who is fit
to minister to the Lord in his own temple? [Psa
24:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#003.md). The glory of God in his
entrance into his temple, [Psa
24:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#007.md).

It is probable that this Psalm was composed on occasion of bringing the
ark from the house of Obed-edom to Mount Sion, and the questions may
respect the fitness of the persons who were to minister before this ark:
the last verses may refer to the opening of the city gates in order to
admit it. As many of the expressions here are nearly the same with those
in [Psa 15:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#001.md), I must refer to that
place for their particular illustration; though it is most likely that
the two Psalms were composed on very different occasions. The first
contains a general question relative to who shall be saved? This is more
particular; and refers to the temple and tabernacle service, and who is
fit to minister there.

[Psalms 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 24:1</span></span>

The earth is the Lord's - He is the Creator and Governor of it; it is
his own property. Men may claim districts and kingdoms of it as their
property, but God is Lord of the soil.

The fullness thereof - "All its creatures." - Targum. Every tree, plant,
and shrub; the silver and the gold, and the cattle on a thousand hills.

They that dwell therein - All human beings.

[Psalms 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 24:2</span></span>

He hath founded it upon the seas - He not only created the vast mass,
but separated the land from the waters, so that the mountains, etc.,
being elevated above the waters, appear to be founded on them, and
notwithstanding all the tossings and ragings of the ocean, these waters
cannot prevail. It is established upon the floods, and cannot be shaken.

[Psalms 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 24:3</span></span>

Who shall ascend - Who is sufficiently holy to wait in his temple? Who
is fit to minister in the holy place?

[Psalms 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 24:4</span></span>

He that hath clean hands - He whose conscience is irreproachable; whose
heart is without deceit and uninfluenced by unholy passions.

Who hath not lifted up his soul - Who has no idolatrous inclination;
whose faith is pure, and who conscientiously fulfils his promises and
engagements.

[Psalms 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 24:5</span></span>

He shall receive the blessing - Perhaps alluding to Obed-edom, at whose
house the ark had been lodged, and on whom God had poured out especial
blessings.

And righteousness - Mercy: every kind of necessary good. It is the mercy
of God that crowns the obedience and fidelity of good men. For what made
them good and faithful? God's mercy. What crowns their fidelity? God's
mercy.

[Psalms 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 24:6</span></span>

This is the generation - This is the description of people who are such
as God can approve of, and delight in.

That seek thy face, O Jacob - It is most certain that אלהי Elohey, O
God, has been lost out of the Hebrew text in most MSS., but it is
preserved in two of Kennicott's MSS., and also in the Syriac, Vulgate,
Septuagint, Ethiopic, Arabic, and Anglo-Saxon. "Who seek thy face, O God
of Jacob."

Selah - That is, It is confirmed; it is true. The persons who abstain
from every appearance of evil, and seek the approbation of God, are
those in whom God will delight.

[Psalms 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 24:7</span></span>

Lift up your heads, O ye gates - The address of those who preceded the
ark, the gates being addressed instead of the keepers of the gates.
Allusion is here made to the triumphal entry of a victorious general
into the imperial city.

In the hymn of Callimachus to Apollo, there are two lines very much like
those in the text; they convey the very same sentiments. The poet
represents the god coming into his temple, and calls upon the priests to
open the doors, etc.

Αυτοι νυν κατοχηες ανακλινεσθε πυλαως,

Αυται δε κληιδες· ὁ γαρ Θεος ουκ ετι μακραν;

"Fall back, ye bolts; ye pond'rous doors, give way

For not far distant is the god of day."

Callim. Hymn in Apol., ver. 6, 7.

The whole of this hymn contains excellent sentiments even on the subject
of the Psalms.

Everlasting doors - There seems to be a reference here to something like
our portcullis, which hangs by pullies above the gate, and can be let
down at any time so as to prevent the gate from being forced. In the
case to which the psalmist refers, the portcullis is let down, and the
persons preceding the ark order it to be raised. When it is lifted up,
and appears above the head or top of the gate, then the folding doors
are addressed: "Be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors;" let there be no
obstruction; and the mighty Conqueror, the King of glory, whose presence
is with the ark, and in which the symbol of his glory appears, shall
enter. Make due preparations to admit so august and glorious a
Personage.

[Psalms 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 24:8</span></span>

Who is this King of glory? - This is the answer of those who are within.
Who is this glorious King, for whom ye demand entrance? To which they
reply: -

The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle - It is Jehovah,
who is come to set up his abode in his imperial city: He who has
conquered his enemies, and brought salvation to Israel. To make the
matter still more solemn, and give those without an opportunity of
describing more particularly this glorious Personage, those within
hesitate to obey the first summons: and then it is repeated, [Psa
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#009.md).

Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors;
and the King of glory shall come in - To which a more particular
question is proposed: - Who is He, This King of glory? To which an
answer is given that admitted of no reply. The Lord of hosts - he who is
coming with innumernble armies, He is this King of glory. On which, we
may suppose, the portcullis was lifted up, the gates thrown open, and
the whole cavalcade admitted. This verse seems to have been spoken
before the ark appeared: Who is this (זה zeh) King of glory? when its
coming was merely announced. In the tenth verse the form is a little
altered, because the ark, the symbol of the Divine Presence, had then
arrived. Who is He, (מי הוא mi hu), this King of glory? Here He is, to
answer for himself. "The Lord is in his holy temple; let all the earth
keep silence before him."

Though this Psalm has all the appearance of being an unfinished piece,
yet there is a vast deal of dignity and majesty in it; and the demands
from without, the questions from those within, and the answers to those
questions, partake of the true sublime; where nature, dignity, and
simplicity, are very judiciously mingled together. The whole procedure
is natural, the language dignified, and the questions and answers full
of simplicity and elevated sentiments.

Several, both among ancients and moderns, have thought this Psalm speaks
of the resurrection of our Lord, and is thus to be understood. It is
easy to apply it in this way: Jesus has conquered sin, Satan, and death,
by dying. He now rises from the dead; and, as a mighty Conqueror, claims
an entrance into the realms of glory, the kingdom which he has purchased
by his blood; there to appear ever in the presence of God for us, to
which he purposes to raise finally the innumerable hosts of his
followers; for in reference to these, He is the Lord of hosts; and, in
reference to his victory, He is the Lord mighty in battle.
