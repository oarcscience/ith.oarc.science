Preface to the Epistle to the Romans

That St. Paul was the author of this epistle, and that it possesses
every evidence of authenticity that any work of the kind can possess, or
that even the most fastidious skepticism can require, has been most
amply proved by Dr. W. Paley, Archdeacon of Carlisle, in his work
entitled "Horae Paulinae; or, the Truth of the Scripture History of St.
Paul evinced, by a comparison of the Epistles which bear his name with
the Acts of the Apostles, and with one another."

Of this apostle I have spoken at large in the notes on the preceding
book, and especially in the observations at the close of the ninth
chapter, to which I beg leave to refer the reader. It will be sufficient
to state here, that Saul, (afterwards called Paul), was born in Tarsus,
a city of Cilicia, of Jewish parents, who possessed the right of Roman
citizens; (see the note on [Act
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#028).md); that, when young, he was sent
to Jerusalem for the purpose of receiving a Jewish education; that he
was there put under the tuition of the famous Rabbi Gamaliel, and was
incorporated with the sect of the Pharisees, of whose system he imbibed
all the pride, self-confidence, and intolerance; and distinguished
himself as one of the most inveterate enemies of the Christian cause;
but, being converted by a most singular interposition of Divine
Providence and grace, he became one of the most zealous promoters and
successful defenders of the cause which he had before so inveterately
persecuted.

Though this epistle is directed to the Romans, yet we are not to suppose
that Romans, in the proper sense of the word, are meant; but rather
those who dwelt at Rome, and composed the Christian Church in that city:
that there were among these Romans, properly such, that is heathens who
had been converted to the Christian faith, there can be no doubt; but
the principal part of the Church in that city seems to have been formed
from Jews, sojourners at Rome, and from such as were proselytes to the
Jewish religion.

When, or by whom, the Gospel was first preached at Rome cannot be
ascertained. Those who assert that St. Peter was its founder, can
produce no solid reason for the support of their opinion. Had this
apostle first preached the Gospel in that city, it is not likely that
such an event would have been unnoticed in the Acts of the Apostles,
where the labors of St. Peter are particularly detailed with those of
St. Paul, which indeed form the chief subject of this book. Nor is it
likely that the author of this epistle should have made no reference to
this circumstance, had it been true. Those who say that this Church was
founded by these two apostles conjointly, have still less reason on
their side; for it is evident, from [Rom
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#008.md), etc., that St. Paul had never
been at Rome previously to his writing this epistle. It is most likely
that no apostle was employed in this important work, and that the Gospel
was first preached there by some of those persons who were converted at
Jerusalem on the day of pentecost; for we find, from [Act
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#010.md), that there were at Jerusalem
strangers of Rome, Jews, and proselytes; and these, on their return,
would naturally declare the wonders they had witnessed, and proclaim
that truth by which they themselves had received salvation. Of Rome
itself, then the metropolis of the world, a particular account has been
given in the note on [Act 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#016.md)
(note); to which the reader is requested to refer.

The occasion of writing this epistle may be easily collected from the
epistle itself. It appears that St. Paul had been made acquainted with
all the circumstances of the Christians at Rome, by Aquila and
Priscilla, (see [Rom 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#003).md), and by
other Jews who had been expelled from Rome by the decree of Claudius,
(mentioned [Act 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#002).md); and, finding
that they consisted partly of heathens converted to Christianity, and
partly of Jews who had, with many remaining prejudices, believed in
Jesus as the true Messiah, and that many contentions arose from the
claims of the Gentile converts to equal privileges with the Jews, and
from the absolute refusal of the Jews to admit these claims unless the
Gentile converts became circumcised, he wrote to adjust and settle these
differences.

Dr. Paley, with his usual perspicuity, has shown that the principal
object of the argumentative part of the epistle is "to place the Gentile
convert upon a parity of situation with the Jewish, in respect of his
religious condition, and his rank in the Divine favor." The epistle
supports this point by a variety of arguments; such as, that no man of
either description was justified by the works of the law - or this plain
reason, that no man had performed them; that it became therefore
necessary to appoint another medium, or condition of justification, in
which new medium the Jewish peculiarity was merged and lost; that
Abraham's own justification was antecedent to the law, and independent
of it; that the Jewish converts were to consider the law as now dead,
and themselves as married to another; that what the law in truth could
not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God had done by sending
his Son; that God had rejected the unbelieving Jews, and had substituted
in their place a society of believers in Christ, collected indifferently
from Jews and Gentiles. Therefore, in an epistle directed to Roman
believers, the point to be endeavored after by St. Paul was to reconcile
the Jewish converts to the opinion that the Gentiles were admitted by
God to a parity of religious situation with themselves, and that without
their being obliged to keep the law of Moses. In this epistle, though
directed to the Roman Church in general, it is, in truth, a Jew writing
to Jews. Accordingly, as often as his argument leads him to say any
thing derogatory from the Jewish institution, he constantly follows it
by a softening clause. Having, [Rom
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#028.md), [Rom
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029.md), pronounced "that he is not a Jew
who is one outwardly, nor that circumcision which is outward in the
flesh," he adds immediately, "What advantage then hath the Jew? or what
profit is there in circumcision? Much every way." Having in [Rom
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#028.md), brought his argument to this
formal conclusion, "that a man is justified by faith, without the deeds
of the law," he presently subjoins, [Rom
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#031.md), "Do we then make void the law
through faith? God forbid! Yea, we establish the law." In the seventh
chapter, when in [Rom 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#006.md) he had
advanced the bold assertion, "that now we are delivered from the law,
that being dead wherein we were held;" in the next verse he comes in
with this healing question, "What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God
forbid! Nay, I had not known sin but by the law." Having, in the
following words, more than insinuated the inefficacy of the Jewish law,
[Rom 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003.md) : "For what the law could not
do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending his own Son in
the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh;"
after a digression indeed, but that sort of a digression which he could
never resist, a rapturous contemplation of his Christian hope, and which
occupies the latter part of this chapter; we find him in the next, as if
sensible that he had said something which would give offense, returning
to his Jewish brethren in terms of the warmest affection and respect: "I
say the truth in Christ Jesus, I lie not; my conscience also bearing me
witness in the Holy Ghost, that I have great heaviness and continual
sorrow in my heart; for I could wish that myself were accursed from
Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh, who are
Israelites, to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the
covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the
promises; whose are the fathers; and of whom, as concerning the flesh,
Christ came." When, in the 31st and 32nd verses of the ninth chapter, he
represented to the Jews the error of even the best of their nation, by
telling them that "Israel, which followed after the law of
righteousness, had not attained to the law of righteousness, because
they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law, for
they stumbled at that stumbling-stone;" he takes care to annex to this
declaration these conciliating expressions: "Brethren, my heart's desire
and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved; for I bear
them record, that they have a zeal of God, but not according to
knowledge." Lastly, having, [Rom
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#020.md), [Rom
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#021.md), by the application of a passage
in Isaiah, insinuated the most ungrateful of all propositions to a
Jewish ear, the rejection of the Jewish nation as God's peculiar people;
he hastens, as it were, to qualify the intelligence of their fall by
this interesting exposition: "I say then, hath God cast away his people,
(i.e. wholly and entirely?) God forbid! For I also am an Israelite, of
the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. God hath not cast away
his people which he foreknew;" and follows this throughout the whole of
the eleventh chapter, in a series of reflections calculated to soothe
the Jewish converts, as well as to procure from their Gentile brethren
respect to the Jewish institution. Dr. Paley, drawing an argument from
this manner of writing, in behalf of the genuineness of this epistle,
adds, "Now all this is perfectly natural. In a real St. Paul writing to
real converts, it is what anxiety to bring them over to his persuasion
would naturally produce; but there is an earnestness and a personality,
if I may so call it, in the manner, which a cold forgery, I apprehend,
would neither have conceived nor supported." Horae Paulinae, p. 49, etc.

From a proper consideration of the design of the apostle in writing this
epistle, and from the nature and circumstances of the persons to whom it
was directed, much light may be derived for a proper understanding of
the epistle itself. When the reader considers that the Church at Rome
was composed of heathens and Jews, that the latter were taught to
consider themselves the only people on earth to whom the Divine favor
extended; that these alone had a right to all the blessings of the
Messiah's kingdom; that the giving them the law and the prophets, which
had not been given to any other people, was the fullest proof that these
privileges did not extend to the nations of the earth; and that, though
it was possible for the Gentiles to be saved, yet it must be in
consequence of their becoming circumcised, and taking on them the yoke
of the law: - when, on the other hand, the reader considers the Roman
Gentiles, who formed the other part of the Church at Rome, as educated
in the most perfect contempt of Judaism and of the Jews, who were deemed
to be haters of all mankind, and degraded with the silliest
superstitions, and now evidently rejected and abandoned by that God in
whom they professed to trust; it is no wonder if, from these causes,
many contentions and scandals arose, especially at a time when the
spirit of Christianity was but little understood, and among a people,
too, who do not appear to have had any apostolic authority established
among them to compose feuds and settle religious differences.

That the apostle had these things particularly in his eye is evident
from the epistle itself. His first object is to confound the pride of
the Jews and the Gentiles; and this he does by showing the former that
they had broken their own law, and, consequently, forfeited all the
privileges which the obedient had a right to expect. He shows the latter
that, however they might boast of eminent men, who had been an honor to
their country, nevertheless, the Gentiles, as a people, were degraded by
the basest of crimes, and the lowest idolatry; that, in a word, the
Gentiles had as little cause to boast in their philosophers as the Jews
had to boast in the faith and piety of their ancestors; "for all had
sinned and come short of the glory of God." This subject is particularly
handled in the five first chapters, and often referred to in other
places.

Concerning the time in which this epistle was written, there is not much
difference of opinion: it is most likely that it was written about a.d.
58, when Paul was at Corinth: see [Rom
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#023.md), conferred with [Co1
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#014.md); and [Rom
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#001.md), conferred with [Ti2
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#020.md). It appears, from [Rom
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#022.md), that Paul did not write this
epistle with his own hand, but used a person called Tertius as his
amanuensis; and that it was sent by the hands of Phoebe, a deaconess,
(δια φοιβης της διακυνου), of the Church of Cenchrea, which was the
eastern port on the Isthmus of Corinth.

From internal evidence Dr. Paley has demonstrated the authenticity of
this epistle; and its existence in the ancient Antehieronymian versions
and the Syriac, as well as its being mentioned by the Apostolic Fathers,
Barnabas, chap. xii. 13; Clemens Romanus, Ep. i. c. i. 30, 32, 35, 46;
Ignatius, Epist. ad Ephes. 20, ad Smyrn. 1, ad Trall. 8; and Polycarp, 3
and 6, and by all succeeding writers, puts it beyond all dispute.

Of the fourteen epistles attributed to St. Paul, (thirteen only of which
bear his name), this has been reckoned the first in importance, though
certainly not in order of time; for there is every reason to believe
that both the epistles to the Thessalonians, that to the Galatians,
those to the Corinthians, the first to Timothy, and that to Titus, were
all written before the epistle to the Romans. See the dates of the books
of the New Testament at the end of the introduction to the Gospels,
etc..

In the arrangement of the epistles nothing seems to have been consulted
besides the length of the epistle, the character of the writer, and the
importance of the place to which it was sent. Rome, being the mistress
of the world, the epistle to that city was placed first. Those to the
Corinthians, because of the great importance of their city, next.
Galatia, Ephesus, Philippi, Colosse, and Thessalonica, follow in
graduated order. Timothy, Titus, and Philemon succeed in the same way:
and the epistle to the Hebrews, because the author of it was long in
dispute, was placed at the end of the epistles of Paul, as being
probably written by him. James, as Bp. of Jerusalem, precedes Peter,
Peter precedes John, as the supposed chief of the apostles; and John the
beloved disciple, Jude. The book of the Revelation, as being long
disputed in the Christian Church, was thrown to the conclusion of the
New Testament Scriptures. The surats or chapters of the Koran were
disposed in the same sort of order; the longest being put first, and all
the short ones thrown to the end, without any regard to the times in
which it was pretended they were revealed.

There have been some doubts concerning the language in which this
epistle was written. John Adrian Bolten endeavored to prove that St.
Paul wrote it in Syriac, and that it was translated into Greek by
Tertius: but this supposition has been amply refuted by Griesbach.
Others think that it must have been written originally in Latin, the
language of the people to whom it was addressed; "for although the Greek
tongue was well known in Rome, yet it was the language of the great and
the learned; and it is more natural to suppose that the apostle would
write in the language of the common people, as those were most likely to
be his chief readers, than that of the great and the learned." This
argument is more specious than solid. -

1\. It is certain that at this time the Greek language was very
generally cultivated in Rome, as it was in most parts of the Roman
empire. Cicer., pro Arch. 10, says Graeca leguntur in omnibus fere
gentibus: Latina, suis finibus, exiguis sane continentur. "The Greek
writings are read in almost all nations: those of the Latin within their
own narrow limits." Tacitus, Orator. 29, observes, Nunc natus infans
delegatur Graeculae alicui ancillae. "Now the new-born child is put
under the care of some Greek maid;" and this undoubtedly for the purpose
of its learning to speak the Greek tongue. And Juvenal, Sat. vi. ver.
184, ridicules this affectation of his countrymen, which in his time
appears to have been carried to a most extravagant excess.

Nam quid rancidius, quam quod se non putat ulla

Formosam, nisi quae de Tusca Graecula facta est?

De Sulmonensi mera Cecropis? Omnia Graece,

Cum sit turpe magis nostris nescire Latine.

Hoc sermone pavent, hoc Iram, Gaudia, Curas,

Hoc cuncta effundunt animi secreta. Quid ultrae

"For what so nauseous and affected too,

As those that think they due perfection want

Who have not learned to lisp the Grecian cant?

In Greece their whole accomplishments they seek:

Their fashion, breeding, language must be Greek,

But raw in all that does to Rome belong,

They scorn to cultivate their mother-tongue,

In Greek they flatter, all their fears they speak,

Tell all their secrets, nay they scold in Greek."

Dryden.

From these testimonies it is evident that the Greek was a common
language in Rome in the days of the apostle; and that in writing in this
language, which he probably understood better than he did Latin, he
consulted the taste and propensity of the Romans, as well as the
probability of his epistle being more extensively read in consequence of
its being written in Greek.

2\. But were these arguments wanting, there are others of great weight
that evince the propriety of choosing this language in preference to any
other. The sacred writings of the Old Testament were, at that time,
confined to two languages, the Hebrew and the Greek. The former was
known only within the confines of Palestine; the latter over the whole
Roman empire: and the Latin tongue appears to have been as much confined
to Italy as the Hebrew was to Judea. The epistle, therefore, being
designed by the Spirit of God to be of general use to the Christian
Churches, not only in Italy, but through Greece and all Asia Minor,
where the Greek language was spoken and understood, it was requisite
that the instructions to be conveyed by it should be put in a language
the most generally known; and a language too which was then in high and
in daily increasing credit.

3\. As the Jews were the principal objects of the epistle, and they must
be convinced of the truth of Christianity from the evidence of their own
Scriptures; and as the Greek version of the Septuagint was then their
universal text-book, in all their dispersions, it was absolutely
requisite that the epistle should be written in a tongue with which they
were best acquainted, and in which their acknowledged Scriptures were
contained. These arguments seem conclusive for a Greek and not a Latin
original of this epistle.

From the manner in which this epistle has been interpreted and applied,
various most discordant and conflicting opinions have originated. Many
commentators, forgetting the scope and design of it, have applied that
to men in general which most obviously belongs to the Jews, as
distinguished from the Gentiles, and to them only. From this one mistake
the principal controversies that have agitated and divided the Church of
Christ concerning the doctrines of unconditional reprobation and
election have arisen. Men, eminent for their talents, learning, and
piety, have interpreted and applied the whole on this mistaken ground.
They have been opposed by others, not at all their inferiors either in
religion or learning, who, not attending properly to the scope of the
apostle, have rather argued from the perfections of the Divine nature,
and the general concurrent sense of Scripture, and thus proved that such
doctrines cannot comport with those perfections, nor with the analogy of
faith; and that the apostle is to be interpreted according to these, and
not according to the apparent grammatical import of the phraseology
which he employs. On both sides the disputes have run high; the cause of
truth has gained little, and Christian charity and candour have been
nearly lost. Dispassionate men, on seeing this, have been obliged to
exclaim: -

\- tantaene animis coelestibus irae!

Can such fierce zeal in heavenly bosoms dwell!

To compose these differences, and do justice to the apostle, and set an
important portion of the word of God in its true and genuine light, Dr.
John Taylor of Norwich, a divine who yielded to few in command of
temper, benevolent feeling, and deep acquaintance with the Hebrew and
Greek Scriptures, undertook the elucidation of this much-controverted
epistle. The result of his labors was a paraphrase and notes on the
whole book, to which is prefixed "A Key to the Apostolic Writings; or,
an essay to explain the Gospel scheme, and the principal words and
phrases the apostles have used in describing it." 4to. 1769, fourth
edition. This Key, in the main, is a most invaluable work, and has done
great justice to the subject. Christians, whether advocates for general
or particular redemption, might have derived great service from this
work, in explaining the Epistle to the Romans; but the author's creed,
who was an Arian, (for he certainly cannot be ranked with modern
Unitarians), has prevented many from consulting his book.

To bring the subject of this epistle before the reader, into the fairest
and most luminous point of view in my power, I think it right to make a
large extract from this Key, steering as clear as possible of those
points in which my own creed is certainly at variance with that of my
author; especially in the articles of Original Sin, the Atonement, and
Deity of Christ; but as these points are seldom directly touched in this
introductory key, the reader need be under no apprehension that he shall
meet with any thing in hostility to the orthodoxy of his own creed.
