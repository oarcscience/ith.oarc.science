### [1 Chronicles Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 24:0</span></span>

David divides the families of Eleazar and Ithamar, by lot, into
twenty-four courses, vv. 1-19. How the rest of the sons of Levi were
disposed of, [Ch1 24:20-31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#020.md).

[1 Chronicles 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 24:2</span></span>

Nadab and Abihu died before their father - That is, during his lifetime.

Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest's office - These two served the
office during the life of their father Aaron; after his death Eleazar
succeeded in the high priesthood. And under Eli the high priest, the
family of Ithamar re-entered into that office.

[1 Chronicles 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 24:3</span></span>

And Ahimelech - Ahimelech is put here for Abiathar, who was high priest
in the days of David. Abiathar had also the name of Ahimelech, as well
as his father. See Calmet.

[1 Chronicles 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 24:5</span></span>

They divided by lot - This prevented jealousies: for, as all the
families were equally noble, they had equal right to all ecclesiastical
and civil distinctions.

[1 Chronicles 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 24:6</span></span>

And Shemaiah - "Moses the great scribe, who is called Shemaiah, the son
of Nethaneel, of the tribe of Levi, wrote them down." - T.

One principal household - for Eleazar - The family of Eleazar was the
most illustrious of the sacerdotal families, because Eleazar was the
first-born of Aaron, Ithamar's family was the second in order and
dignity; therefore one of the principal families of Eleazar was first
taken, and then one of Ithamar's, and thus alternately till the whole
was finished.

[1 Chronicles 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch1 24:19</span></span>

Under Aaron their father - That is, they followed the order and plans
laid down by Aaron during his lifetime.

[1 Chronicles 24:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch1 24:26</span></span>

The sons of Merari - It is remarkable that not a word is here spoken of
the family of Gershom.

[1 Chronicles 24:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">ch1 24:31</span></span>

These likewise cast lots - The Levites were divided into twenty-four
orders; and these were appointed by lot to serve under the twenty-four
orders of the priests: the first order of Levities under the first order
of priests, and so on. The meaning is not very clear: "both elder and
younger," says Bishop Patrick, "had their places by lot, not by
seniority of houses. They who were of greater dignity drew lots against
those who were of less; and were to take their courses according to the
lot they drew." This may have been the case; but we are very little
interested in the subject.
