### [2 Chronicles Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 28:0</span></span>

Ahaz succeeds his father Jotham, and reigns wickedly for sixteen years,
[Ch2 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#001.md). He restores idolatry in its
grossest forms, [Ch2 28:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#002.md); and is
delivered Into the hands of the kings of Israel and Syria, [Ch2
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#005.md). Pekah slays one hundred and
twenty thousand Jews in one day, and carries away captive two hundred
thousand of the people, whom, at the instance of Oded the prophet, they
restore to liberty, and send home, clothed and fed, [Ch2
28:6-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#006.md). Ahaz sends to the king of
Assyria for help against the Edomites, Philistines, etc., from whom he
receives no effectual succor, [Ch2
28:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#016.md). He sins yet more, spoils and
shuts up the temple of God, and propagates idolatry throughout the land,
[Ch2 28:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#022.md). A reference to has
acts, his death, and burial, [Ch2
28:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#026.md), [Ch2
28:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#027.md).

[2 Chronicles 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 28:1</span></span>

Ahaz was twenty years old - For the difficulties in this chronology, see
the notes on [Kg2 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#002) (note.md).

[2 Chronicles 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 28:3</span></span>

Burnt his children in the fire - There is a most remarkable addition
here in the Chaldee which I shall give at length: "Ahaz burnt his
children in the fire; but the Word of the Lord snatched Hezekiah from
among them; for it was manifest before the Lord that the three righteous
men, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, were to proceed from him; who
should deliver up their bodies that they might be cast into a burning
fiery furnace, on account of the great and glorious Name, (יהוה) and
from which they should escape. First, Abram escaped from the furnace of
fire among the Chaldeans, into which he had been cast by Nimrod, because
he would not worship their idols. Secondly, Tamar escaped burning in the
house of judgment of Judah, who had said, Bring her out, that she may be
burnt. Thirdly, Hezekiah the son of Ahaz escaped from the burning, when
Ahaz his father cast him into the valley of the son of Hinnom, on the
altars of Tophet. Fourthly, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, escaped from
the burning fiery furnace of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. Fifthly,
Joshua, the son of Josedek the high priest, escaped, when the impious
Nebuchadnezzar had cast him into a burning fiery furnace, with Achaab
the son of Kolia, and Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, the false prophet.
They were consumed by fire; but Joshua the son of Josedek escaped
because of his righteousness."

[2 Chronicles 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 28:5</span></span>

Delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria - For the better
understanding of these passages, the reader is requested to refer to
what has been advanced in the notes on the sixteenth chapter of [Kg2
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#005.md), etc.

[2 Chronicles 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 28:6</span></span>

A hundred and twenty thousand - It is very probable that there is a
mistake in this number. It is hardly possible that a hundred and twenty
thousand men could have been slain in one day; yet all the versions and
MSS. agree in this number. The whole people seem to have been given up
into the hands of their enemies.

[2 Chronicles 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 28:9</span></span>

But a prophet of the Lord - whose name was Oded - To this beautiful
speech nothing can be added by the best comment; it is simple, humane,
pious, and overwhelmingly convincing: no wonder it produced the effect
mentioned here. That there was much of humanity in the heads of the
children of Ephraim who joined with the prophet on this occasion, the
fifteenth verse sufficiently proves. They did not barely dismiss these
most unfortunate captives, but they took that very spoil which their
victorious army had brought away; and they clothed, fed, shod, and
anointed, these distressed people, set the feeblest of them upon asses,
and escorted them safely to Jericho. We can scarcely find a parallel to
this in the universal history of the wars which savage man has carried
on against his fellows, from the foundation of the world.

[2 Chronicles 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 28:16</span></span>

The kings of Assyria to help him - Instead of מלכי malchey; Kings; the
Vulgate, Syriac, Arabic, and Chaldee, one MS., and the parallel place,
[Kg2 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#007.md), have מלך melek, King, in
the singular number. This king was Tiglath-pileser, as we learn from the
second book of Kings.

[2 Chronicles 28:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 28:21</span></span>

But he helped him not - He did him no ultimate service. See the note on
[Kg2 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#009.md).

After [Kg2 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#015.md), the 23d, 24th, and
25th verses are introduced before the 16th, in the Syriac and Arabic,
and the 22d verse is wholly wanting in both, though some of the
expressions may be found in the twenty-first verse.

[2 Chronicles 28:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch2 28:23</span></span>

He sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him - "This
passage," says Mr. Hallet, "greatly surprised me; for the sacred
historian himself is here represented as saying, The gods of Damascus
had smitten Ahaz. But it is impossible to suppose that an inspired
author could say this; for the Scripture everywhere represents the
heathen idols as nothing and vanity, and as incapable of doing either
good or hurt. All difficulty is avoided if we follow the old Hebrew
copies, from which the Greek translation was made, Και ειπεν ὁ βασιλεις
Αχαζ, εκζητησω τους Θεους Δαμασκου τους τυπτοντας με, And King Ahaz
said, I Will Seek to the Gods of Damascus Which Have Smitten Me; and
then it follows, both in Hebrew and Greek, He said moreover, Because the
gods of the king of Syria help them; therefore will I sacrifice to them,
that they may help me. Both the Syriac and Arabic give it a similar
turn; and say that Ahaz sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, and said, Ye
are my gods and my lords; you will I worship, and to you will I
sacrifice."

[2 Chronicles 28:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch2 28:24</span></span>

Shut up the doors - He caused the Divine worship to be totally
suspended; and they continued shut till the beginning of the reign of
Hezekiah, one of whose first acts was to reopen them, and thus to
restore the Divine worship, [Ch2 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#003.md).

[2 Chronicles 28:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ch2 28:27</span></span>

The kings of Israel - It is a common thing for the writer of this book
to put Israel for Judah. He still considers them as one people, because
proceeding from one stock. The versions and MSS. have the same reading
with the Hebrew; the matter is of little importance, and with this
interpretation none can mistake.
