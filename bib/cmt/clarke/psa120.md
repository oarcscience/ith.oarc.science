### [Psalms Chapter 120](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 120:0</span></span>

The psalmist, in great distress, calls on the Lord for deliverance from
calumny and defamation, [Psa 120:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#001),
[Psa 120:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#002); shows the punishment that
awaits his persecutor, [Psa 120:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#003),
[Psa 120:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#004); deplores the necessity of
his residence with the ungodly, [Psa
120:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#005).

This Psalm, and all the rest that follow it, to the end of [Psa
134:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001), fifteen in number, are called
Psalms of Degrees; for thus the Hebrew title המעלות hammaaloth is
generally translated, as coming from the root עלה alah, to ascend or
mount upwards. Hence מעלות maaloth, steps or stairs for ascending, [Kg1
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#019), [Kg1
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#020); [Kg2
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#013). But as the word may be applied
to elevation in general, hence some have thought that it may here
signify the elevation of voice; "these Psalms being sung with the
highest elevations of voice and music." Others have thought the word
expresses rather the matter of these Psalms, as being of peculiar
excellence: and hence Junius and Tremellius prefix to each Canticum
excellentissimum, "A most excellent ode."

R. D. Kimchi says, "There were fifteen steps by which the priests
ascended into the temple, on each of which they sang one of these
fifteen Psalms." This opinion I find referred to in the Apocryphal
Gospel of the birth of Mary: "Her parents brought her to the temple, and
set her upon one of the steps. Now there are fifteen steps about the
temple, by which they go up to it, according to the fifteen Psalms of
Degrees." But the existence of such steps and practices cannot be
proved.

Aben Ezra supposes that the word means some kind of tune sung to these
Psalms. It is more likely, if the title be really ancient, that it was
affixed to them on account of their being sung on the return from the
Babylonish captivity, as the people were going up to Jerusalem; for
though some of them are attributed to David, yet it is very probable
that they were all made long after his time, and probably during the
captivity, or about the end of it. The author of these fifteen Psalms is
not known; and most probably they were not the work of one person. They
have been attributed to David, to Solomon, to Ezra, to Haggai, to
Zechariah, and to Malachi, without any positive evidence. They are,
however, excellent in their kind, and written with much elegance;
containing strong and nervous sentiments of the most exalted piety,
expressed with great felicity of language in a few words.

[Psalms 120:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 120:1</span></span>

In my distress - Through the causes afterwards mentioned.

I cried unto the Lord - Made strong supplication for help.

And he heard one - Answered my prayer by comforting my soul.

It appears to be a prayer of the captives in Babylon for complete
liberty; or perhaps he recites the prayer the Israelites had made
previously to their restoration.

[Psalms 120:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 120:2</span></span>

Lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue - From a people without faith,
without truth, without religion; who sought by lies and calumnies to
destroy them.

[Psalms 120:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 120:3</span></span>

What shall be given unto thee? - Thou art worthy of the heaviest
punishments.

[Psalms 120:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 120:4</span></span>

Sharp arrows - The Chaldee has, "The strong, sharp arrows are like
lightning from above, with coals of juniper kindled in hell beneath." On
the juniper, see the note on [Job
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#004), where this passage is explained.
Fiery arrows, or arrows wrapped about with inflamed combustibles, were
formerly used in sieges to set the places on fire. See my notes on [Eph
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#016) (note).

[Psalms 120:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 120:5</span></span>

That I sojourn in Mesech - The Chaldee has it, "Wo is me that I am a
stranger with the Asiatics, (אוסאי useey), and that I dwell in the tents
of the Arabs." Calmet, who understands the Psalm as speaking of the
state of the captives in Babylon and its provinces, says, "Meshec was
apparently the father of the Mosquians, who dwelt in the mountains that
separate Iberia from Armenia, and both from Colchis. These provinces
were subjugated by Nebuchadnezzar; and it is evident from [Kg2
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#023), [Kg2
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#024); [Kg2
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#011); [Kg2
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#012), [Kg2
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#013), that many of the Jews were held
in captivity in those countries. As to Kedar, it extended into Arabia
Petraea, and towards the Euphrates; and is the country afterwards known
as the country of the Saracens."

[Psalms 120:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 120:6</span></span>

My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace - A restless,
barbarous, warlike, and marauding people.

[Psalms 120:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 120:7</span></span>

I am for peace - We love to be quiet and peaceable; but they are
continually engaged in excursions of rapine and plunder. It is evident
that the psalmist refers to a people like the Scenitae or wandering
Arabs, who live constantly in tents, and subsist by robbery; plundering
and carrying away all that they can seize. The poor captives wished them
to cultivate the arts of peace, and live quietly; but they would hear of
nothing but their old manner of life.
