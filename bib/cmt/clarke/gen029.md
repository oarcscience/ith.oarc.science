### [Genesis Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#001)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 29:0</span></span>

Jacob proceeds on his journey, [Gen
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#001). Comes to a well where the flocks
of his uncle Laban, as well as those of several others, were usually
watered, [Gen 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#002), [Gen
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#003). Inquires from the shepherds
concerning Laban and his family, [Gen
29:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#004). While they are conversing
about watering the sheep, [Gen 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#007),
[Gen 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#008), Rachel arrives, [Gen
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#009). He assists her to water her
flock, [Gen 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#010); makes himself known
unto her, [Gen 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#011), [Gen
29:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#012). She hastens home and
communicates the tidings of Jacob's arrival to her father, [Gen
29:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#012). Laban hastens to the well,
embraces Jacob, and brings him home, [Gen
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#013). After a month's stay, Laban
proposes to give Jacob wages, [Gen
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#014), [Gen
29:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#015). Leah and Rachel described, [Gen
29:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#016), [Gen
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#017). Jacob proposes to serve seven
years for Rachel, [Gen 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#018). Laban
consents, [Gen 29:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#019). When the seven
years were fulfilled, Jacob demands his wife, [Gen
29:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#020), [Gen
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#021). Laban makes a marriage feast,
[Gen 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#022); and in the evening
substitutes Leah for Rachel, to whom he gives Zilpah for handmaid, [Gen
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#023), [Gen
29:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#024). Jacob discovers the fraud, and
upbraids Laban, [Gen 29:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#025). He excuses
himself, [Gen 29:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#026); and promises to
give him Rachel for another seven years of service, [Gen
29:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#027). After abiding a week with Leah,
he receives Rachel for wife, to whom Laban gives Bilhah for handmaid,
[Gen 29:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#028), [Gen
29:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#029). Jacob loves Rachel more than
Leah, and serves seven years for her, [Gen
29:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#030). Leah being despised, the Lord
makes her fruitful, while Rachel continues barren, [Gen
29:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#031). Leah bears Reuben, [Gen
29:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#032), and Simeon, [Gen
29:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#033), and Levi, [Gen
29:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#034), and Judah; after which she
leaves off bearing, [Gen 29:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#035).

[Genesis 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 29:1</span></span>

Then Jacob went on his journey - The original is very remarkable: And
Jacob lifted up his feet, and he traveled unto the land of the children
of the east. There is a certain cheerfulness marked in the original
which comports well with the state of mind into which he had been
brought by the vision of the ladder and the promises of God. He now saw
that having God for his protector he had nothing to fear, and therefore
he went on his way rejoicing.

People of the east - The inhabitants of Mesopotamia and the whole
country beyond the Euphrates are called קדם kedem, or easterns, in the
sacred writings.

[Genesis 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 29:2</span></span>

Three flocks of sheep - צאן tson, small cattle, such as sheep, goats,
etc.; See note on [Gen 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#016). Sheep,
in a healthy state, seldom drink in cold and comparatively cold
countries: but it was probably different in hot climates. The three
flocks, if flocks and not shepherds be meant, which were lying now at
the well, did not belong to Laban, but to three other chiefs; for
Laban's flock was yet to come, under the care of Rachel, [Gen
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#006).

[Genesis 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 29:3</span></span>

All the flocks - Instead of העדרים hadarim, flocks, the Samaritan reads
haroim, shepherds; for which reading Houbigant strongly contends, as
well in this verse as in [Gen 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#008). It
certainly cannot be said that all the flocks rolled the stone from the
well's mouth, and watered the sheep: and yet so it appears to read if we
prefer the common Hebrew text to the Samaritan. It is probable that the
same reading was originally that of the second verse also.

And put the stone again upon the well's mouth - It is very likely that
the stone was a large one, which was necessary to prevent ill-minded
individuals from either disturbing the water, or filling up the well;
hence a great stone was provided, which required the joint exertions of
several shepherds to remove it; and hence those who arrived first waited
till all the others were come up, that they might water their respective
flocks in concert.

[Genesis 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 29:4</span></span>

My brethren, whence be ye? - The language of Laban and his family was
Chaldee and not Hebrew; (see [Gen
31:47](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#047)); but from the names which Leah
gave to her children we see that the two languages had many words in
common, and therefore Jacob and the shepherds might understand each
other with little difficulty. It is possible also that Jacob might have
learned the Chaldee or Aramitish language from his mother, as this was
his mother's tongue.

[Genesis 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 29:5</span></span>

Laban the son of Nahor - Son is here put for grandson, for Laban was the
son of Bethuel the son of Nahor.

[Genesis 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 29:6</span></span>

Is he well? - השלום לו hashalom lo? Is there peace to him? Peace among
the Hebrews signified all kinds of prosperity. Is he a prosperous man in
his family and in his property? And they said, He is well, שלום shalom,
he prospers.

Rachel - cometh with the sheep - רחל rachel (the ch sounded strongly
guttural) signifies a sheep or ewe; and she probably had her name from
her fondness for these animals.

[Genesis 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 29:7</span></span>

It is yet high day - The day is but about half run; neither is it time
that the cattle should be gathered together - it is surely not time yet
to put them into the folds; give them therefore water, and take them
again to pasture.

[Genesis 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 29:8</span></span>

We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together - It is a rule that
the stone shall not be removed till all the shepherds and the flocks
which have a right to this well be gathered together; then, and not
before, we may water the sheep. See note on [Gen
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#003).

[Genesis 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 29:9</span></span>

Rachel came with her father's sheep - So we find that young women were
not kept concealed in the house till the time they were married, which
is the common gloss put on עלמה almah, a virgin, one concealed. Nor was
it beneath the dignity of the daughters of the most opulent chiefs to
carry water from the well, as in the case of Rebekah; or tend sheep, as
in the case of Rachel. The chief property in those times consisted in
flocks: and who so proper to take care of them as those who were
interested in their safety and increase? Honest labor, far from being a
discredit, is an honor both to high and low. The king himself is served
by the field; and without it, and the labor necessary for its
cultivation, all ranks must perish. Let every son, let every daughter,
learn that it is no discredit to be employed, whenever it may be
necessary, in the meanest offices, by which the interests of the family
may be honestly promoted.

[Genesis 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 29:10</span></span>

Jacob went near, and rolled the stone - Probably the flock of Laban was
the last of those which had a right to the well; that flock being now
come, Jacob assisted the shepherds to roll off the stone, (for it is not
likely he did it by himself), and so assisted his cousin, to whom he was
as yet unknown, to water her flock.

[Genesis 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 29:11</span></span>

Jacob kissed Rachel - A simple and pure method by which the primitive
inhabitants of the earth testified their friendship to each other, first
abused by hypocrites, who pretended affection while their vile hearts
meditated terror, (see the case of Joab), and afterwards disgraced by
refiners on morals, who, while they pretended to stumble at those
innocent expressions of affection and friendship, were capable of
committing the grossest acts of impurity.

And lifted up his voice - It may be, in thanksgiving to God for the
favor he had shown him, in conducting him thus far in peace and safety.

And wept - From a sense of the goodness of his heavenly Father, and his
own unworthiness of the success with which he had been favored. The same
expressions of kindness and pure affection are repeated on the part of
Laban, [Gen 29:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#013).

[Genesis 29:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 29:14</span></span>

My bone and my flesh - One of my nearest relatives.

[Genesis 29:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 29:15</span></span>

Because thou art my brother, etc. - Though thou art my nearest relative,
yet I have no right to thy services without giving thee an adequate
recompense. Jacob had passed a whole month in the family of Laban, in
which he had undoubtedly rendered himself of considerable service. As
Laban, who was of a very saving if not covetous disposition, saw that he
was to be of great use to him in his secular concerns, he wished to
secure his services, and therefore asks him what wages he wished to
have.

[Genesis 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 29:17</span></span>

Leah was tender-eyed - רכות raccoth, soft, delicate, lovely. I believe
the word means just the reverse of the signification generally given to
it. The design of the inspired writer is to compare both the sisters
together, that the balance may appear to be greatly in favor of Rachel.
The chief recommendation of Leah was her soft and beautiful eyes; but
Rachel was יפת תאר yephath toar, beautiful in her shape, person, mien,
and gait, and יפת מראה yephath mareh, beautiful in her countenance. The
words plainly signify a fine shape and fine features, all that can be
considered as essential to personal beauty. Therefore Jacob loved her,
and was willing to become a bond servant for seven years, that he might
get her to wife; for in his destitute state he could produce no dowry,
and it was the custom of those times for the father to receive a portion
for his daughter, and not to give one with her. One of the Hindoo
lawgivers says, "A person may become a slave on account of love, or to
obtain a wife." The bad system of education by which women are spoiled
and rendered in general good for nothing, makes it necessary for the
husband to get a dowry with his wife to enable him to maintain her;
whereas in former times they were well educated and extremely useful,
hence he who got a wife almost invariably got a prize, or as Solomon
says, got a good thing.

[Genesis 29:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 29:20</span></span>

And Jacob served seven years for Rachel - In ancient times it appears to
have been a custom among all nations that men should give dowries for
their wives; and in many countries this custom still prevails. When
Shechem asked Dinah for wife, he said, Ask me never so much - dowry and
gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me. When Eliezer
went to get Rebekah for Isaac, he took a profusion of riches with him,
in silver, gold, jewels, and raiment, with other costly things, which,
when the contract was made, he gave to Rebekah, her mother, and her
brothers. David, in order to be Saul's son-in-law, must, instead of a
dowry, kill Goliath; and when this was done, he was not permitted to
espouse Michal till he had killed one hundred Philistines. The Prophet
Hosea bought his wife for fifteen pieces of silver, and a homer and a
half of barley. The same custom prevailed among the ancient Greeks,
Indians, and Germans. The Romans also had a sort of marriage entitled
per coemptionem, "by purchase." The Tartars and Turks still buy their
wives; but among the latter they are bought as a sort of slaves.

Herodotus mentions a very singular custom among the Babylonians, which
may serve to throw light on Laban's conduct towards Jacob. "In every
district they annually assemble all the marriageable virgins on a
certain day; and when the men are come together and stand round the
place, the crier rising up sells one after another, always bringing
forward the most beautiful first; and having sold her for a great sum of
gold, he puts up her who is esteemed second in beauty. On this occasion
the richest of the Babylonians used to contend for the fairest wife, and
to outbid one another. But the vulgar are content to take the ugly and
lame with money; for when all the beautiful virgins are sold, the crier
orders the most deformed to stand up; and after he has openly demanded
who will marry her with a small sum, she is at length given to the man
that is contented to marry her with the least. And in this manner the
money arising from the sale of the handsome served for a portion to
those whose look was disagreeable, or who had any bodily imperfection. A
father was not permitted to indulge his own fancy in the choice of a
husband for his daughter; neither might the purchaser carry off the
woman which he had bought without giving sufficient security that he
would live with her as his own wife. Those also who received a sum of
money with such as could bring no price in this market, were obliged
also to give sufficient security that they would live with them, and if
they did not they were obliged to refund the money." Thus Laban made use
of the beauty of Rachel to dispose of his daughter Leah, in the spirit
of the Babylonian custom, though not in the letter.

And they seemed unto him but a few days - If Jacob had been obliged to
wait seven years before he married Rachel, could it possibly be said
that they could appear to him as a few days? Though the letter of the
text seems to say the contrary, yet there are eminent men who strongly
contend that he received Rachel soon after the month was finished, (see
[Gen 29:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#014)), and then served seven
years for her, which might really appear but a few days to him, because
of his increasing love to her; but others think this quite incompatible
with all the circumstances marked down in the text, and on the
supposition that Jacob was not now seventy-seven years of age, as most
chronologers make him, but only fifty-seven, (see on Genesis 31
(note))., there will be time sufficient to allow for all the
transactions which are recorded in his history, during his stay with
Laban. As to the incredibility of a passionate lover, as some have
termed him, waiting patiently for seven years before he could possess
the object of his wishes, and those seven years appearing to him as only
a few days, it may be satisfactorily accounted for, they think, two
ways:

1\. He had the continual company of his elect spouse, and this certainly
would take away all tedium in the case.

2\. Love affairs were not carried to such a pitch of insanity among the
patriarchs as they have been in modern times; they were much more sober
and sedate, and scarcely ever married before they were forty years of
age, and then more for convenience, and the desire of having an
offspring, than for any other purpose.

At the very lowest computation Jacob was now fifty-seven, and
consequently must have passed those days in which passion runs away with
reason. Still, however, the obvious construction of the text shows that
he got Rachel the week after he had married Leah.

[Genesis 29:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 29:21</span></span>

My days are fulfilled - My seven years are now completed, let me have my
wife, for whom I have given this service as a dowry.

[Genesis 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 29:22</span></span>

Laban - made a feast - משתה mishteh signifies a feast of drinking. As
marriage was a very solemn contract, there is much reason to believe
that sacrifices were offered on the occasion, and libations poured out;
and we know that on festival occasions a cup of wine was offered to
every guest; and as this was drunk with particular ceremonies, the feast
might derive its name from this circumstance, which was the most
prominent and observable on such occasions.

[Genesis 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">gen 29:23</span></span>

In the evening - he took Leah his daughter - As the bride was always
veiled, and the bride chamber generally dark, or nearly so, and as Leah
was brought to Jacob in the evening, the imposition here practiced might
easily pass undetected by Jacob, till the ensuing day discovered the
fraud.

[Genesis 29:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gen 29:24</span></span>

And Laban gave - Zilpah his maid - Slaves given in this way to a
daughter on her marriage, were the peculiar property of the daughter;
and over them the husband had neither right nor power.

[Genesis 29:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gen 29:26</span></span>

It must not be so done in our country - It was an early custom to give
daughters in marriage according to their seniority; and it is worthy of
remark that the oldest people now existing, next to the Jews, I mean the
Hindoos, have this not merely as a custom, but as a positive law; and
they deem it criminal to give a younger daughter in marriage while an
elder daughter remains unmarried. Among them it is a high offense, equal
to adultery, "for a man to marry while his elder brother remains
unmarried, or for a man to give his daughter to such a person, or to
give his youngest daughter in marriage while the eldest sister remains
unmarried." - Code of Gentoo Laws, chap. xv., sec. 1, p. 204. This was a
custom at Mesopotamia; but Laban took care to conceal it from Jacob till
after he had given him Leah. The words of Laban are literally what a
Hindoo would say on such a subject.

[Genesis 29:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">gen 29:27</span></span>

Fulfill her week - The marriage feast, it appears, lasted seven days; it
would not therefore have been proper to break off the solemnities to
which all the men of the place had been invited, [Gen
29:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#022), and probably Laban wished to
keep his fraud from the public eye; therefore he informs Jacob that if
he will fulfill the marriage week for Leah, he will give him Rachel at
the end of it, on condition of his serving seven other years. To this
the necessity of the case caused Jacob to agree; and thus Laban had
fourteen years' service instead of seven: for it is not likely that
Jacob would have served even seven days for Leah, as his affection was
wholly set on Rachel, the wife of his own choice. By this stratagem
Laban gained a settlement for both his daughters. What a man soweth,
that shall he reap. Jacob had before practiced deceit, and is now
deceived; and Laban, the instrument of it, was afterwards deceived
himself.

[Genesis 29:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">gen 29:28</span></span>

And Jacob did so - and he gave him Rachel - It is perfectly plain that
Jacob did not serve seven years more before he got Rachel to wife; but
having spent a week with Leah, and in keeping the marriage feast, he
then got Rachel, and served afterwards seven years for her. Connections
of this kind are now called incestuous; but it appears they were
allowable in those ancient times. In taking both sisters, it does not
appear that any blame attached to Jacob, though in consequence of it he
was vexed by their jealousies. It was probably because of this that the
law was made, Thou shalt not take a wife to her sister, to vex her,
besides the other in her life-time. After this, all such marriages were
strictly forbidden.

[Genesis 29:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">gen 29:31</span></span>

The Lord saw that Leah was hated - From this and the preceding verse we
get the genuine meaning of the word שנא sane, to hate, in certain
disputed places in the Scriptures. The word simply signifies a less
degree of love; so it is said, [Gen
29:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#030) : "Jacob loved Rachel more than
Leah," i.e., he loved Leah less than Rachel; and this is called hating
in [Gen 29:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#031) : When the Lord saw that
Leah was hated - that she had less affection shown to her than was her
due, as one of the legitimate wives of Jacob, he opened her womb - he
blessed her with children. Now the frequent intercourse of Jacob with
Leah (see the following verses) sufficiently proves that he did not hate
her in the sense in which this term is used among us; but he felt and
showed less affection for her than for her sister. So Jacob have I
loved, but Esau have I hated, simply means, I have shown a greater
degree of affection for Jacob and his posterity than I have done for
Esau and his descendants, by giving the former a better earthly portion
than I have given to the latter, and by choosing the family of Jacob to
be the progenitors of the Messiah. But not one word of all this relates
to the eternal states of either of the two nations. Those who endeavor
to support certain peculiarities of their creed by such scriptures as
these, do greatly err, not knowing the Scripture, and not properly
considering either the sovereignty or the mercy of God.

[Genesis 29:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">gen 29:32</span></span>

She called his name Reuben - ראובן reuben, literally, see ye or behold a
son; for Jehovah hath looked upon, ראה raah, beheld, my affliction;
behold then the consequence, I have got a son!

[Genesis 29:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">gen 29:33</span></span>

She called his name Simeon - שמעון shimon, hearing; i.e., God had
blessed her with another son, because he had heard that she was hated -
loved less than Rachel was.

[Genesis 29:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">gen 29:34</span></span>

Therefore was his name called Levi - לוי levi, joined; because she
supposed that, in consequence of all these children, Jacob would become
joined to her in as strong affection, at least, as he was to Rachel.
From Levi sprang the tribe of Levites, who instead of the first-born,
were joined unto the priests in the service of the sanctuary. See [Num
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#002), [Num
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#004).

[Genesis 29:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">gen 29:35</span></span>

She called his name Judah - יהודה yehudah, a confessor; one who
acknowledges God, and acknowledges that all good comes from his hands,
and gives him the praise due to his grace and mercy. From this patriarch
the Jews have their name, and could it be now rightly applied to them,
it would intimate that they were a people that confess God, acknowledge
his bounty, and praise him for his grace.

Left bearing - That is, for a time; for she had several children
afterwards. Literally translated, the original תעמד מלדת taamod
milledeth - she stood still from bearing, certainly does not convey the
same meaning as that in our translation; the one appearing to signify
that she ceased entirely from having children; the other, that she only
desisted for a time, which was probably occasioned by a temporary
suspension of Jacob's company, who appears to have deserted the tent of
Leah through the jealous management of Rachel.

The intelligent and pious care of the original inhabitants of the world
to call their children by those names which were descriptive of some
remarkable event in providence, circumstance of their birth, or domestic
occurrence, is worthy, not only of respect, but of imitation. As the
name itself continually called to the mind, both of the parents and the
child, the circumstance from which it originated, it could not fail to
be a lasting blessing to both. How widely different is our custom!
Unthinking and ungodly, we impose names upon our offspring as we do upon
our cattle; and often the dog, the horse, the monkey, and the parrot,
share in common with our children the names which are called Christian!
Some of our Christian names, so called, are absurd, others are
ridiculous, and a third class impious; these last being taken from the
demon gods and goddesses of heathenism. May we hope that the rational
and pious custom recommended in the Scriptures shall ever be restored,
even among those who profess to believe in, fear, and love God!
