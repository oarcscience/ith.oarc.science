### [Deuteronomy Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 13:0</span></span>

Of false prophets and their lying signs, [Deu
13:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#001). Of those who endeavor to
entice and seduce people to idolatry, [Deu
13:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#007). The punishment of such, [Deu
13:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#009). Of cities perverted from the
pure worship of God, [Deu 13:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#012).
How that city is to be treated, [Deu
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#015). All the spoil of it to be
destroyed, [Deu 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#016). Promises to
them who obey these directions, [Deu
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#017), [Deu
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#018).

[Deuteronomy 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 13:1</span></span>

If there arise among you a prophet - Any pretending to have a Divine
influence, so as to be able perfectly to direct others in the way of
salvation; or a dreamer of dreams - one who pretends that some deity has
spoken to him in the night-season; and giveth thee a sign, אות oth, what
appears to be a miraculous proof of his mission; or a wonder, מופת
mopheth, some type or representation of what he wishes to bring you over
to: as some have pretended to have received a consecrated image from
heaven; hence the origin of the Palladium, Numa's Shields, and many of
the deities among the Hindoos. But here the word seems to mean some
portentous sign, such as an eclipse, which he who knew when it would
take place might predict to the people who knew nothing of the matter,
and thereby accredit his pretensions.

[Deuteronomy 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 13:3</span></span>

The Lord your God proveth you - God permits such impostors to arise to
try the faith of his followers, and to put their religious experience to
the test; for he who experimentally knows God cannot be drawn away after
idols. He who has no experimental knowledge of God, may believe any
thing. Experience of the truths contained in the word of God can alone
preserve any man from Deism, or a false religion. They who have not this
are a prey to the pretended prophet, and to the dreamer of dreams.

[Deuteronomy 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 13:6</span></span>

If thy brother - or thy son - The teacher of idolatry was to be put to
death; and so strict was this order that a man must neither spare nor
conceal his brother, son, daughter, wife, nor friend, because this was
the highest offense that could be committed against God, and the most
destructive to society; hence the severest laws were enacted against it.

[Deuteronomy 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 13:13</span></span>

Children of Belial - בליעל, from בל bal, not, and יעל yaal, profit; -
Sept. ανδρες παρανομοι, lawless men; - persons good for nothing to
themselves or others, and capable of nothing but mischief.

[Deuteronomy 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 13:15</span></span>

Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants - If one city were permitted to
practice idolatry, the evil would soon spread, therefore the contagion
must be destroyed in its birth.

[Deuteronomy 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 13:17</span></span>

And there shall cleave naught of the cursed thing - As God did not
permit them to take the spoils of these idolatrous cities, they could be
under no temptation to make war upon them. It could only be done through
a merely religious motive, in obedience to the command of God, as they
could have no profit by the subversion of such places. How few religious
wars would there ever have been in the world had they been regulated by
this principle: "Thou shalt neither extend thy territory, nor take any
spoils!"
