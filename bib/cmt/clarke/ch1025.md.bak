### [1 Chronicles Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 25:0</span></span>

The number and offices of the singers and players on musical
instruments; and their division by lot into twenty-four courses, vv.
1-31.

[1 Chronicles 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 25:1</span></span>

David and the captains of the host - The chiefs of those who formed the
several orders: not military captains.

Should prophesy - Should accompany their musical instruments with prayer
and singing.

[1 Chronicles 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 25:2</span></span>

Which prophesied - Sung hymns and prayed. But the Targum understands
this of prophesying in the proper sense of the term; and therefore says,
"Who prophesied by the Holy Spirit." Jarchi is of the same opinion and
quotes the case of Elisha, [Kg2 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#015.md);
While the minstrel played, the hand of the Lord \[i.e., the spirit of
prophecy\] was upon him.

[1 Chronicles 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 25:3</span></span>

The sons of Jeduthun - six - That is, six with their father, otherwise,
there are but five. Hence it is said, they were under the hands of their
father Jeduthun, who prophesied with a harp, etc.

[1 Chronicles 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 25:5</span></span>

To lift up the horn - "The horn of prophecy," says Jarchi; "to sound
with the trumpet in the words of prophecy before the Lord." - T.

Three daughters - These also were employed among the singers.

[1 Chronicles 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 25:7</span></span>

Two hundred fourscore and eight - That it twelve classes of twenty-four
Levites each; for two hundred and eighty-eight divided by twelve quotes
twenty-four.

[1 Chronicles 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch1 25:9</span></span>

For Asaph to Joseph - His first-born.

The second to Gedaliah - The first-born of Jeduthun.

[1 Chronicles 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 25:10</span></span>

The third to Zaccur - The first-born of Asaph.

[1 Chronicles 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch1 25:11</span></span>

The fourth to Izri - The second son of Jeduthun.

[1 Chronicles 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch1 25:12</span></span>

The fifth to Nethaniah - The third son of Asaph. Thus we find the lot
did not run in any particular kind of order.

[1 Chronicles 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch1 25:14</span></span>

Jesharelah - Supposed to be the same with Uzziel, son of Heman.

[1 Chronicles 25:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">ch1 25:31</span></span>

Romamti-ezer - Both these names belong to the same person. He is
mentioned also [Ch1 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#004.md).

With this immense parade of noise and show, (David's own invention),
Christianity has nothing to do.
