### [2 Chronicles Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

Solomon, and the chiefs of the congregation, go to Gibeon, where was the
tabernacle of the Lord, and the brazen altar; and there he offers a
thousand sacrifices, [Ch2 1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md). The
Lord appears to him in a dream, and gives him permission to ask any
gift, [Ch2 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#007.md). He asks wisdom, [Ch2
1:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#008.md), which is granted; and riches,
wealth, and honor besides, [Ch2 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#011.md),
[Ch2 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#012.md). His kingdom is established,
[Ch2 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#013.md). His chariots, horsemen, and
horses, [Ch2 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#014.md). His abundant
riches, [Ch2 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#015.md). He brings horses,
linen yarn, and chariots, at a fixed price, out of Egypt, [Ch2
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#016.md), [Ch2
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#017.md).

[2 Chronicles 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 1:1</span></span>

And Solomon the son of David - The very beginning of this book shows
that it is a continuation of the preceding, and should not be thus
formally separated from it. See the preface to the first book.

The Lord his God was with him - "The Word of the Lord was his support."
- Targum.

[2 Chronicles 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 1:2</span></span>

Then Solomon spake - This is supposed to have taken place in the second
year of his reign.

[2 Chronicles 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 1:4</span></span>

But the ark - The tabernacle and the brazen altar remained still at
Gibeon; but David had brought away the ark out of the tabernacle, and
placed it in a tent at Jerusalem; [Sa2
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#002.md), [Sa2
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#017.md).

[2 Chronicles 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 1:5</span></span>

Sought unto it - Went to seek the Lord there.

[2 Chronicles 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 1:7</span></span>

In that night - The night following the sacrifice. On Solomon's choice,
see the notes on [Kg1 3:5-15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#005) (note.md).

[2 Chronicles 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 1:9</span></span>

Let thy promise - דברך debarcha, thy word; פתגמך pithgamach, Targum. It
is very remarkable that when either God or man is represented as having
spoken a word then the noun פתגם pithgam is used by the Targumist; but
when word is used personally, then he employs the noun מימרא meymera,
which appears to answer to the Λογος of St. John, [Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md), etc.

[2 Chronicles 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 1:14</span></span>

He had a thousand and four hundred chariots - For these numbers, see the
notes on [Kg1 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#026.md).

[2 Chronicles 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 1:15</span></span>

Made silver and gold - See on [Kg1
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#027) (note.md), [Kg1
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#028) (note.md).

[2 Chronicles 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 1:16</span></span>

Linen yarn - See the note on [Kg1
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#028.md), where this subject is
particularly examined.

[2 Chronicles 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 1:17</span></span>

A horse for a hundred and fifty - Suppose we take the shekel at the
utmost value at which it has been rated, three shillings; then the price
of a horse was about twenty-two pounds ten shillings.

On Solomon's multiplying horses, Bishop Warburton has made some
judicious remarks: -

"Moses had expressly prohibited the multiplying of horses, [Deu
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#016.md), by which the future king was
forbidden to establish a body of cavalry, because this could not be
effected without sending into Egypt, with which people God had forbidden
any communication, as this would be dangerous to religion. When Solomon
had violated this law, and multiplied horses to excess, [Kg1
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#026.md), it was soon attended with those
fatal consequences that the law foretold: for this wisest of kings
having likewise, in violation of another law, married Pharaoh's
daughter, (the early fruits of this commerce), and then, by a repetition
of the same crime, but a transgression of another law, having espoused
more strange women, [Kg1 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#001.md); they
first, in defiance of a fourth law, persuaded him to build them idol
temples for their use, and afterwards, against a fifth law, brought him
to erect other temples for his own. Now the original of all this
mischief was the forbidden traffic with Egypt for horses; for thither
were the agents of Solomon sent to mount his cavalry. Nay, this great
king even turned factor for the neighboring monarchs, [Ch2
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#017.md), and this opprobrious commerce
was kept up by his successors and attended with the same pernicious
consequences. Isaiah denounces the mischiefs of this traffic; and
foretells that one of the good effects of leaving it would be the
forsaking of their idolatries, [Isa
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#001.md), [Isa
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#004.md), [Isa
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#006.md), [Isa
31:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#007.md)." - See Divine Legation, vol.
iii., p. 289 and Dr. Dodd's Notes.
