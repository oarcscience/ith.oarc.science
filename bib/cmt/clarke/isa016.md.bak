### [Isaiah Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 16:0</span></span>

The distress of Moab pathetically described by the son of the prince, or
ruler of the land, being forced to flee for his life through the desert,
that he may escape to Judea; and the young women, like young birds
scared from their nest, wade helpless through the fords of Arnon, the
boundary of their country, to seek protection in some foreign land, [Isa
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#001.md), [Isa
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#002.md). The prophet addresses Sion,
exhorting her to show mercy to her enemies in their distress, that her
throne may be established in righteousness, [Isa
16:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#003.md). Exceeding great pride of Moab,
[Isa 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#006.md). The terrible calamities
about to fall upon Moab farther described by the languishing of the
vine, the ceasing of the vintage, the sound of the prophet's bowels
quivering like a harp, etc., [Isa
16:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#007.md). Awful nearness of the full
accomplishment of the prophecy, [Isa
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#014.md).

[Isaiah 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 16:1</span></span>

Send ye the lamb, etc. "I will send forth the son, etc." - Both the
reading and meaning of this verse are still more doubtful than those of
the preceding. The Septuagint and Syriac read אשלח eshlach, I will send,
in the first person singular, future tense: the Vulgate and Talmud
Babylon, read שלח shelach, send, singular imperative: some read שלחו
shilchu, send ye forth, or shalechu, they send forth. The Syriac, for כר
car, a lamb, reads בר bar, a son, which is confirmed by five MSS. of
Kennicott and De Rossi. The two first verses describe the distress of
Moab on the Assyrian invasion in which even the son of the prince of the
country is represented as forced to flee for his life through the
desert, that he may escape to Judea; and the young women are driven
forth like young birds cast out of the nest, and endeavoring to wade
through the fords of the river Arnon. Perhaps there is not so much
difficulty in this verse as appears at first view. "Send the lamb to the
ruler of the land," may receive light from [Kg2
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#004.md), [Kg2
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#005.md) : "And Mesha, king of Moab, was a
sheepmaster, and rendered unto the king of Israel one hundred thousand
lambs with their wool, and one hundred thousand rams: but when Ahab was
dead, the king of Moab rebelled against Israel." Now the prophet exhorts
them to begin paying the tribute as formerly, that their punishment
might be averted or mitigated.

[Isaiah 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 16:3</span></span>

Take counsel "Impart counsel" - The Vulgate renders the verbs in the
beginning of this verse in the singular number, So the Keri; and so
likewise sixty-one MSS. of Kennicott's and De Rossi's have it, and
nineteen editions, and the Syriac. The verbs throughout the verse are
also in the feminine gender; agreeing with Zion, which I suppose to be
understood.

[Isaiah 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 16:4</span></span>

Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab "Let the outcasts of Moab
sojourn with thee, O Zion" - Setting the points aside, this is by much
the most obvious construction of the Hebrew, as well as most agreeable
to the context, and the design of the prophet. And it is confirmed by
the Septuagint οἱ φυγαδες Μωαβ, and Syriac.

The oppressors "The oppressor" - Perhaps the Israelites, who in the time
of Ahab invaded Judah, defeated his army, slaying one hundred and twenty
thousand men, and brought the kingdom to the brink of destruction.
Judah, being now in a more prosperous condition, is represented as able
to receive and to protect the fugitive Moabites. And with those former
times of distress the security and flourishing state of the kingdom
under the government of Hezekiah is contrasted.

[Isaiah 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 16:5</span></span>

In mercy shall the throne be established - May not this refer to the
throne of Hezekiah? Here we have the character of such a king as cannot
fail to be a blessing to the people.

1\. "He sitteth on the throne in truth" - He does not merely profess to
be the father and protector of his people: but he is actually such.

2\. He is judging. He is not a man of war or blood, who wastes his
subjects' lives and treasures in contentions with neighboring nations,
in order to satisfy his ambition by the extension of his territory. On
the contrary, his whole life is occupied in the distribution of justice.

3\. He seeketh judgment. He seeks out the poor distressed ones who
cannot make their way to him, and avenges them on their oppressors.

4\. He hastens righteousness. He does not suffer any of the courts of
justice to delay the determination of the causes brought before them: he
so orders that the point in litigation be fairly, fully, and speedily
heard; and then judgment pronounced. Delays in the execution of justice
answer little end but the enriching of unprincipled lawyers.

[Isaiah 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 16:6</span></span>

We have heard of the pride of Moab "We have heard the pride of Moab" -
For גא ge, read גאה geah; two MSS., one ancient, and [Jer
48:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#029.md). Zephaniah, [Zep
2:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#008.md), in his prophecy against Moab,
the subject of which is the same with that of Jeremiah in his
forty-eighth chapter, (see the note on [Isa
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001) (note).md), enlarges much on the
pride of Moab, and their insolent behavior towards the Jews: -

"I have heard the reproach of Moab;

And the revilings of the sons of Ammon:

Who have reproached my people;

And have magnified themselves against their borders.

Therefore, as I live, saith Jehovah God of hosts, the God of Israel:

Surely Moab shall be as Sodom,

And the sons of Ammon as Gomorrah:

A possession of nettles, and pits of salt,

And a desolation for ever.

The residue of my people shall spoil them,

And the remnant of my nation shall dispossess them:

This shall they have for their pride;

Because they have raised a reproach, and have magnified themselves

Against the people of Jehovah God of hosts."

[Isaiah 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 16:7</span></span>

For the foundations of Kir-hareseth "For the men of Kirhares" - A
palpable mistake in this place is happily corrected by the parallel text
of [Jer 48:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#031.md), where, instead of אשישי
ashishey, foundations or flagons, we read אנשי anshey, men. In the same
place of Jeremiah, and in [Jer 48:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#036.md),
and here in [Isa 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#011.md), the name of
the city is Kirhares, not Kirhareseth.

[Isaiah 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 16:8</span></span>

Languish "Are put to shame" - Here the text of Jeremiah leaves us much
at a loss, in a place that seems to be greatly corrupted. The Septuagint
join the two last words of this verse with the beginning of the
following. Their rendering is: και ουκ εντραπησῃ, τα πεδια Εσεβων. For
אך ach they must have read אל al; otherwise, how came they by the
negative, which seems not to belong to this place? Neither is it easy to
make sense of the rest without a small alteration, by reading, instead
of εντραπησῃ τα, εντραπησεται. In a word, the Arabic version taken from
the Septuagint, plainly authorizes this reading of the Septuagint, and
without the negative; and it is fully confirmed by MSS. Pachom. and 1.
D. II., which have both of them εντραπησεται πεδια Εσεβων, without the
negative; which makes an excellent sense, and, I think, gives us the
true reading of the Hebrew text; אך נכלמו שדמות חשבון ak nichlemu
shadmoth cheshbon. They frequently render the verb נכלם nichlam by
εντρεπομαι. And נכלמו nichlemu answers perfectly well to אמלל umlal, the
parallel word in the next line. The MSS. vary in expressing the word
נכאים nechaim, which gives no tolerable sense in this place; one reads
נוכאים nochaim; two others בכאים bechaim; in another the כ caph is upon
a rasure of two letters; and the Vulgate instead of it reads מכותם
mecotham, plagas suas. - L.

For the men of Kirhares ye shall make a moan. For the fields of Heshbon
are put to shame. This is Bp. Lowth's sense of the passage.

Her branches are stretched out "Her branches extended themselves" - For
נטשו nitteshu, a MS. has נגשו niggeshu; which may perhaps be right.
Compare [Jer 48:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#032.md), which has in this
part of the sentence the synonymous word נגעו nagau.

The meaning of this verse is, that the wines of Sibmah and Heshbon were
greatly celebrated, and in high repute with all the great men and
princes of that and the neighboring countries; who indulged themselves
even to intemperance in the use of them. So that their vines were so
much in request as not only to be propagated all over the country of
Moab to the sea of Sodom, but to have scions of them sent even beyond
the sea into foreign countries.

הלמו halemu, knocked down, demolished; that is overpowered, intoxicated.
The drunkards of Ephraim are called by the prophet, [Isa
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#001.md), הלומי יין halumey yayin,
drinkers of wine. See Schultens on [Pro
23:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#025.md). Gratius, speaking of the
Mareotic wine, says of it,

Pharios quae fregit noxia reges. Cyneg. 312.

[Isaiah 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 16:9</span></span>

With the weeping "As with the weeping" - For בבכי bibechi, a MS. reads
בכי bechi. In [Jer 48:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#032.md), it is מבכי
mibbechi. The Septuagint read כבכי kibeki, as with weeping, which I
follow.

For thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen "And upon thy
vintage the destroyer hath fallen" - ועל קצירך הידד נפל veal ketsirech
heidad naphal. In these few words there are two great mistakes, which
the text of [Jer 48:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#032.md) rectifies. For
קצירך ketsirech, it has בצירך betsirech; and for הידד heidad, שדד
shoded; both which corrections the Chaldee in this place confirms. As to
the first,

"Hesebon and Eleale, and

The flowery dale of Sibmah, clad with vines,"

were never celebrated for their harvests; it was the vintage that
suffered by the irruption of the enemy; and so read the Septuagint and
Syriac. הידד heidad is the noisy acclamation of the treaders of the
grapes. And see what sense this makes in the literal rendering of the
Vulgate: super messem tuam vox calcantium irruit, "upon thy harvest the
voice of the treaders rushes." The reading in [Jer
48:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#032.md) is certainly right, שדד נפל
shoded naphal, "the destroyer hath fallen." The shout of the treaders
does not come in till the next verse; in which the text of Isaiah in its
turn mends that of [Jer 48:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#033.md), where
instead of the first הידד heidad, "the shout," we ought undoubtedly to
read, as here, הדרך haddorech, "the treader."

[Isaiah 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 16:10</span></span>

Neither shall there be shouting "An end is put to the shouting" - The
Septuagint read השבת hishbeth, passive, and in the third person;
rightly, for God is not the speaker in this place. The rendering of the
Septuagint is πεπαυται γαρ κελευσμα, "the cry ceaseth;" which last word,
necessary to the rendering of the Hebrew and to the sense, is supplied
by MSS. Pachom. and 1. D. II., having been lost out of the other copies.

[Isaiah 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 16:12</span></span>

When it is seen that Moab, etc. "When Moab shall see," etc. - For נראה
nirah, a MS. reads ראה raah, and so the Syriac and Chaldee. "Perhaps כי
נראה ki nirah is only a various reading of כי נלאה ki nilah." Secker. A
very probable conjecture.

[Isaiah 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 16:14</span></span>

Within three years - בשלש beshalish כשלש keshalish, according, or in or
about three years, is the reading of nine of Kennicott's and De Rossi's
MSS., and two ancient editions.

But the present reading may well stand: "Now, the Lord hath spoken,
saying, Within three years, as the years of a hireling." It seems as if
this prophecy had been delivered before, without any time specified for
its fulfillment; but now the time is determined" in three years, as the
years of a hireling" - for, as a hireling counts even to a single day,
and will not abide with his employer an hour beyond the time agreed on;
so, in three years, even to a day, from the delivery of this prophecy,
shall destruction come upon Moab. This is the import of the present
text; but if we take כשלש keshalish, AS in three years, or in about
three years' time, the prophecy is not so definite.

These three years, says Calmet, are mentioned from the death of Ahaz,
see [Isa 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#028.md), and end the third year
of Hezekiah, three years before the taking of Samaria by Shalmaneser.
This conqueror did not ruin Moab so completely as not to leave a man in
the land; the final desolation of Moab was reserved for Nebuchadnezzar,
five years after the taking of Jerusalem.

Feeble "And without strength" - An ancient MS., with the Septuagint,
reads ולא velo, "and not."
