### [Genesis Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 36:0</span></span>

The genealogy of Esau, i.e., his sons, by his Canaanitish wives Adah,
Aholibamah, and Bashemath, [Gen
36:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#001.md). The children of Adah and
Bashemath, [Gen 36:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#004.md). Of Aholibamah,
[Gen 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#005.md). Esau departs from Canaan
and goes to Mount Seir, [Gen 36:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#006.md).
The generations of Esau, i.e., his grandchildren, while in Seir, [Gen
36:7-19](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#007). Anah finds mules (Yemim.md) in
the wilderness, [Gen 36:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#024.md). The
generations of Seir, the Horite, [Gen
36:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#029.md). The kings which reigned in
Edom, [Gen 36:31-39](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#031.md). The dukes that
succeeded them, [Gen 36:40-43](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#040.md).

[Genesis 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 36:1</span></span>

These are the generations of Esau - We have here the genealogy of Esau
in his sons and grandsons, and also the genealogy of Seir the Horite.
The genealogy of the sons of Esau, born in Canaan, is related [Gen
36:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#001.md); those of his grandchildren
born in Seir, [Gen 36:9-19](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#009.md); those of
Seir the Horite, [Gen 36:20-30](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#020.md). The
generations of Esau are particularly marked, to show how exactly God
fulfilled the promises he made to him, Genesis 25 and 27; and those of
Seir the Horite are added, because his family became in some measure
blended with that of Esau.

[Genesis 36:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 36:2</span></span>

His wives - It appears that Esau's wives went by very different names.
Aholibamah is named Judith, [Gen
26:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#034.md); Adah is called Bashemath in the
same place; and she who is here called Bashemath is called Mahalath,
[Gen 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#009.md). These are variations which
cannot be easily accounted for; and they are not of sufficient
importance to engross much time. It is well known that the same persons
in Scripture are often called by different names.

Anah the daughter of Zibeon - But this same Anah is said to be the son
of Zibeon, [Gen 36:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#024.md), though in this
and [Gen 36:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#014.md) he is said to be the
daughter of Zibeon. But the Samaritan, the Septuagint, (and the Syriac,
in [Gen 36:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#002).md), read son instead of
daughter, which Houbigant and Kennicott contend to be the true reading.
Others say that daughter should be referred to Aholibamah, who was the
daughter of Anah, and granddaughter of Zibeon. I should rather prefer
the reading of the Samaritan, Septuagint, and Syriac, and read, both
here and in [Gen 36:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#014.md), "Aholibamah,
the daughter of Anah the son of Zibeon," and then the whole will agree
with [Gen 36:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#024.md).

[Genesis 36:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 36:6</span></span>

Esau took his wives, etc. - So it appears that Esau and Jacob dwelt
together in Canaan, whither the former removed from Seir, probably soon
after the return of Jacob. That they were on the most friendly footing
this sufficiently proves; and Esau shows the same dignified conduct as
on other occasions, in leaving Canaan to Jacob, and returning again to
Mount Seir; certainly a much less fruitful region than that which he now
in behalf of his brother voluntarily abandoned.

[Genesis 36:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 36:12</span></span>

Timna was concubine to Eliphaz - As Timna was sister to Lotan the
Horite, [Gen 36:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#022.md), we see how the
family of Esau and the Horites got intermixed. This might give the sons
of Esau a pretext to seize the land, and expel the ancient inhabitants,
as we find they did, [Deu 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#012.md).

Amalek - The father of the Amalekites, afterwards bitter enemies to the
Jews, and whom God commanded to be entirely exterminated, [Deu
25:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#017.md), [Deu
25:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#019.md).

[Genesis 36:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 36:15</span></span>

Dukes of the sons of Esau - The word duke comes from the Latin dux, a
captain or leader. The Hebrew אלוף alluph has the same signification;
and as it is also the term for a thousand, which is a grand capital or
leading number, probably the אלופי alluphey or dukes had this name from
being leaders of or captains over a company of one thousand men; just as
those among the Greeks called chiliarchs, which signifies the same; and
as the Romans called those centurions who were captains over one hundred
men, from the Latin word centum, which signifies a hundred. The ducal
government was that which prevailed first among the Idumeans, or
descendants of Esau. Here fourteen dukes are reckoned to Esau, seven
that came of his wife, Adah, four of Bashemath, and three of Aholibamah.

[Genesis 36:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 36:16</span></span>

Duke Korah - This Dr. Kennicott pronounces to be an interpolation. "It
is certain, from [Gen 36:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#004.md), that
Eliphaz was Esau's son by Adah; and from [Gen
36:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#011.md), [Gen
36:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#012.md), that Eliphaz had but six sons,
Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, Kenaz, and Amalek. It is also certain, from
[Gen 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#005.md), [Gen
36:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#014.md), that Korah was the son of Esau
(not of Eliphaz) by Aholibamah; and as such he is properly mentioned in
[Gen 36:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#018.md) : These are the sons of
Aholibamah, Esau's wife: duke Jeush, duke Jaalam, Duke Korah. It is
clear, therefore, that some transcriber has improperly inserted duke
Korah in [Gen 36:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#016.md); from which
interpolation both the Samaritan text and the Samaritan version are
free." - Kennicott's Remarks. Everything considered, I incline to the
opinion that these words were not originally in the text.

[Genesis 36:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 36:20</span></span>

These are the sons of Seir the Horite - These Horites were the original
inhabitants of the country of Seir, called the land of the Horites, and
afterwards the land of the Idumeans, when the descendants of Esau had
driven them out. These people are first mentioned [Gen
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#006.md).

[Genesis 36:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 36:21</span></span>

These are the dukes of the Horites - It appears pretty evident that the
Horites and the descendants of Esau were mixed together in the same
land, as before observed; and Calmet has very properly remarked, that if
we compare this verse with [Gen 36:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#030.md),
there were princes of Seir in the country of Seir, and in that of Edom;
and in comparing the generations of Seir and Esau, we are obliged to
consider these princes as contemporary.

[Genesis 36:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gen 36:24</span></span>

This was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness - The words את
הימם eth kaiyemim, here translated mules, has given rise to a great
variety of conjectures and discordant opinions. St. Jerome, who renders
it aquas calidas, warm springs, or hot baths, says there are as many
opinions concerning it as there are commentators.

The Septuagint has τον Ιαμειν, which seems to be the name of a man; but
this is expressed in a great variety of ways in different MSS. of that
version.

The Syriac renders it mayé, waters; the author of this version having
read in the Hebrew copy from which he translated. מים mayim, waters, for
ימם yemim, the two first letters being transposed.

Onkelos translates the word גבריא gibbaraiya, giants, or strong or
powerful men.

The Samaritan text has haaimim, and the Samaritan version am aimai, the
Emim, a warlike people, bordering upon the Horites.

The Targum of Jonathan ben Uzziel paraphrases the place thus: "This is
the Anah who united the onager with the tame ass, and in process of time
he found mules produced by them." R. D. Kimchi says, that "Zibeon was
both the father and brother of Anah; and this Anah, intent on
heterogeneous mixtures, caused asses and horses to copulate, and so
produced mules." R. S. Jarchi is of the same opinion. See his comment on
this place.

Bochart believes the Emim are meant; and argues forcibly, 1. That מצא
matsa, he found, never signifies to invent, but rather the meeting with
or happening on a thing which already exists. 2. That mules are never
called ימם yemim in the Scriptures, but פרדים peradim. 3. That Anah fed
Asses only, not horses. And, 4. That there is no mention of mules in
Palestine till the days of David. From the whole he concludes that the
Emim are meant, with whom Anah fought; and he brings many places of
Scripture where the same form of expression, he or they found, signifies
the onset to battle, [Jdg 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#005.md); [Sa1
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#003.md); [Kg1
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#024.md); [Ch2
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#008.md); [Num
35:27](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#027.md); [Gen
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#014.md); with many others. See the
Hierozoicon, vol. i., cap. 21, p. 23S., edit. 1692.

Gusset, in Comment. Heb. Ling., examines what Bochart has asserted, and
supposes that mules, not the Emim, were found by Anah.

Wagenseil would credit what Bochart has asserted, did not stronger
reasons lead him to believe that the word means a sort of plant!

From the above opinions and versions the reader may choose which he
likes best, or invent one for himself. My own opinion is, that mules
were not known before the time of Anah; and that he was probably the
first who coupled the mare and ass together to produce this mongrel, or
the first who met with creatures of this race in some very secluded part
of the wilderness. Is it not probable that from this Anah, or ענה enah,
the Enetae derived at least their fabulous origin, whom Homer mentions
as famous for their race of wild mules?

Παφλαγονων δ' ἡγειτο Πυλαιμενεος λασιον κηρ,

Εξ Ενετων, ὁθεν ἡμιονων γενος αγροτεραων.

IL., lib. ii., v. 852.

The Paphlagonians Pylaemenes rules,

Where rich Henetia breeds her Savage Mules.

Pope.

The Enetae or Henetae, who were a people contiguous to Paphlagonia,
Cappadocia, and Galatia, might have derived their origin from this Anah,
or Henah, out of which the Ενετοι of the ancient Greek writers might
have been formed; and according to Theophrastus, Strabo, and Plutarch,
the first mules were seen among these people. See Ludov, De Dieu and
Scheuchzer.

[Genesis 36:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">gen 36:31</span></span>

Before there reigned any king over - Israel - I suppose all the verses,
from [Gen 36:31-39](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#031.md) inclusive, have
been transferred to this place from [Ch1
1:43-50](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#043.md), as it is not likely they
could have been written by Moses; and it is quite possible they might
have been, at a very early period, written in the margin of an authentic
copy, to make out the regal succession in Edom, prior to the
consecration of Saul; which words being afterwards found in the margin
of a valuable copy, from which others were transcribed, were supposed by
the copyist to be a part of the text, which having been omitted by the
mistake of the original writer, had been since added to make up the
deficiency; on this conviction he would not hesitate to transcribe them
consecutively in his copy. In most MSS. sentences and paragraphs have
been left out by the copyists, which, when perceived, have been added in
the margin, either by the original writer, or by some later hand. Now,
as the margin was the ordinary place where glosses or explanatory notes
were written, it is easy to conceive how the notes, as well as the parts
of the original text found in the margin, might be all incorporated with
the text by a future transcriber; and his MSS., being often copied,
would of course multiply the copies with such additions, as we have much
reason to believe has been the case. This appears very frequently in the
Vulgate and Septuagint; and an English Bible now before me written some
time in the fourteenth century, exhibits several proofs of this
principle. See the preface to this work.

I know there is another way of accounting for those words on the ground
of their being written originally by Moses; but to me it is not
satisfactory. It is simply this: the word king should be considered as
implying any kind of regular government, whether by chiefs, dukes,
judges, etc., and therefore when Moses says these are the kings which
reigned in Edom, before there was any king in Israel, he may be only
understood as saying that these kings reigned among the Edomites before
the family of Jacob had acquired any considerable power, or before the
time in which his twelve sons had become the fathers of those numerous
tribes, at the head of which, as king himself in Jeshurun, he now stood.

Esau, after his dukes, had eight kings, who reigned successively over
their people, while Israel were in affliction in Egypt.

[Genesis 36:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">gen 36:33</span></span>

Jobab the son of Zerah - Many have supposed that Jobab is the same as
Job, so remarkable for his afflictions and patience; and that Eliphaz,
mentioned [Gen 36:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#010.md), etc., was the
same who in the book of Job is called one of his friends: but there is
no proper proof of this, and there are many reasons against it.

[Genesis 36:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">gen 36:35</span></span>

Smote Midian in the field of Moab - Bishop Cumberland supposes that this
was Midian, the son of Abraham by Keturah, and that he was killed by
Hadad some time before he was one hundred and nine years of age; and
that Moses recorded this, probably, because it was a calamity to the
ancestor of Jethro, his father-in-law - Orig. of Nat., p. 14.

[Genesis 36:40](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">gen 36:40</span></span>

These are the names of the dukes that came of Esau - These dukes did not
govern the whole nation of the Idumeans, but they were chiefs in their
respective families, in their places - the districts they governed, and
to which they gave their names. Calmet thinks that those mentioned above
were dukes in Edom or Idumea at the time of the exodus of Israel from
Egypt.

[Genesis 36:43](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">gen 36:43</span></span>

He is Esau the father of the Edomites - That is, The preceding list
contains an account of the posterity of Esau, who was the father of
Edom. Thus ends Esau's history; for after this there is no farther
account of his life, actions, or death, in the Pentateuch.

1\. As Esau is so considerable a person in polemic divinity, it may be
necessary, in this place especially, to say something farther of his
conduct and character. I have already, in several places, endeavored,
and I hope successfully, to wipe off the odium that has been thrown upon
this man, (see the notes on Genesis 27 (note) and Genesis 33 (note)).,
without attempting to lessen his faults; and the unprejudiced reader
must see that, previously to this last account we have of him, his
character stands without a blot, except in the case of selling his
birthright, and his purpose to destroy his brother. To the first he was
led by his famishing situation and the unkindness of his brother, who
refused to save his life but on this condition; and the latter, made in
the heat of vexation and passion, he never attempted to execute, even
when he had the most ample means and the fairest opportunity to do it.

Dr. Shuckford has drawn an impartial character of Esau, from which I
extract the following particulars: "Esau was a plain, generous, and
honest man, for we have no reason, from any thing that appears in his
life or actions, to think him wicked beyond other men of his age or
times; and his generous and good temper appears from all his behavior
towards his brother. When they first met he was all humanity and
affection, and he had no uneasiness when he found that Jacob followed
him not to Seir, but went to live near his father. And at Isaac's death
we do not find that he made any difficulty of quitting Canaan, which was
the very point which, if he had harbored any latent (evil) intentions,
would have revived all his resentments. He is indeed called in Scripture
the profane Esau; and it is written, Jacob have I loved, and Esau have I
hated; but there is, I think, no reason to infer, from any of those
expressions, that Esau was a very wicked man, or that God hated or
punished him for an immoral life. For, 1. The sentence here against him
is said expressly to be founded, not upon his actions, for it was
determined before the children had done good or evil. 2. God's hatred of
Esau was not a hatred which induced him to punish him with any evil, for
he was as happy in all the blessings of this life as either Abraham,
Isaac, or Jacob; and his posterity had a land designed by God to be
their possession, as well as the children of Jacob, and they were put in
possession of it much sooner than the Israelites; and God was pleased to
protect them in the enjoyment of it, and to caution the Israelites
against invading them with a remarkable strictness, [Deu
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#004.md), [Deu
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#005.md). And as God was pleased thus to
bless Esau and his children in the blessings of this life, even as much
as he blessed Abraham, Isaac, or Jacob, if not more, why may we not hope
to find him with them at the last day, as well as Lot or Job or any
other good and virtuous man, who was not designed to be a partaker of
the blessing given to Abraham? 3. All the punishment inflicted on Esau
was an exclusion from being heir to the blessing promised to Abraham and
to his seed, which was a favor not granted to Lot, to Job, to several
other very virtuous and good men. 4. St. Paul, in the passage before
cited, only intends to show the Jews that God had all along given the
favors that led to the Messiah where he pleased; to Abraham, not to Lot;
to Jacob, not to Esau; as at the time St. Paul wrote the Gentiles were
made the people of God, not the Jews. 5. Esau is indeed called profane,
(βεβηλος), but I think that word does not mean wicked or immoral, ασεβης
or ἁμαρτωλος· he was called profane for not having that due value for
the priest's office which he should have had; and therefore, though I
think it does not appear that he was cut off from being the heir of the
promises by any particular action in his life, yet his turn of mind and
thoughts do appear to have been such as to evidence that God's purpose
towards Jacob was founded on the truest wisdom." - Shuckford's
Connections, vol. ii., p.174, etc.

The truth is, the Messiah must spring from some One family, and God
chose Abraham's through Isaac, Jacob, etc., rather than the same through
Ishmael, Esau, and the others in that line; but from this choice it does
not follow that the first were all necessarily saved, and the others
necessarily lost.

2\. To some the genealogical lists in this chapter will doubtless appear
uninteresting, especially those which concern Esau and his descendants;
but it was as necessary to register the generations of Esau as to
register those of Jacob, in order to show that the Messiah did not
spring from the former, but that he did spring from the latter. The
genealogical tables, so frequently met with in the sacred writings, and
so little regarded by Christians in general, are extremely useful. 1. As
they are standing proofs of the truth of the prophecies, which stated
that the Messiah should come from a particular family, which prophecies
were clearly fulfilled in the birth of Christ. 2. As they testify, to
the conviction of the Jews, that the Messiah thus promised is found in
the person of Jesus of Nazareth, who incontestably sprang from the last,
the only remaining branch of the family of David. These registers were
religiously preserved among the Jews till the destruction of Jerusalem,
after which they were all destroyed, insomuch that there is not a Jew in
the universe who can trace himself to the family of David; consequently,
all expectation of a Messiah to come is, even on their own principles,
nugatory and absurd, as nothing remains to legitimate his birth. When
Christ came all these registers were in existence. When St. Matthew and
St. Luke wrote, all these registers were still in existence; and had
they pretended what could not have been supported, an appeal to the
registers would have convicted them of a falsehood. But no Jew attempted
to do this, notwithstanding the excess of their malice against Christ
and his followers; and because they did not do it, we may safely assert
no Jew could do it. Thus the foundation standeth sure.
