### [Psalms Chapter 147](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 147:0</span></span>

The psalmist praises God for his goodness to Jerusalem, [Psa
147:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#001.md); shows his great mercy to them
that trust in him, [Psa 147:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#004.md); he
extols him for his mercies, and providential kindness, [Psa
147:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#007.md); for his defense of
Jerusalem, [Psa 147:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#012.md); For his
wonders in the seasons, [Psa
147:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#016.md); and his word unto Jacob,
[Psa 147:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#019.md), [Psa
147:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#020.md).

This Psalm, which is without title in the Hebrew, Chaldee, and Vulgate,
is attributed by the other Versions to Haggai and Zechariah. It was
probably penned after the captivity, when the Jews were busily employed
in rebuilding Jerusalem, as may be gathered from the second and
thirteenth verses. It may be necessary to remark that all the Versions,
except the Chaldee, divide this Psalm at the end of the eleventh verse,
and begin a new Psalm at the twelfth. By this division the numbers of
the Psalms agree in the Versions with the Hebrew; the former having
been, till now, one behind.

[Psalms 147:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 147:1</span></span>

Praise is comely - It is decent, befitting, and proper that every
intelligent creature should acknowledge the Supreme Being: and as he
does nothing but good to the children of men, so they should speak good
of his name.

[Psalms 147:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 147:2</span></span>

The Lord doth build up - The psalmist appears to see the walls rising
under his eye, because the outcasts of Israel, those who had been in
captivity, are now gathered together to do the work.

[Psalms 147:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 147:3</span></span>

He healeth the broken in heart - שבורי, the shivered in heart. From the
root שבר shabar, to break in pieces, we have our word shiver, to break
into splinters, into shivers. The heart broken in pieces by a sense of
God's displeasure.

[Psalms 147:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 147:4</span></span>

He telleth the number of the stars - He whose knowledge is so exact as
to tell every star in heaven, can be under no difficulty to find out and
collect all the scattered exiles of Israel.

[Psalms 147:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 147:5</span></span>

His understanding is infinite - To his intelligence there is no number:
though he numbers the stars, his understanding is without number. It is
infinite; therefore, he can know, as he can do, all things.

[Psalms 147:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 147:6</span></span>

The Lord lifteth up the meek - The humbled, the afflicted.

[Psalms 147:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 147:7</span></span>

Sing unto the Lord - ענו enu, sing a responsive song, sing in parts,
answer one another.

[Psalms 147:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 147:8</span></span>

Who covereth the heaven with clouds - Collects the vapours together, in
order to cause it to rain upon the earth. Even the direction of the
winds, the collection of the clouds, and the descent of the rain, are
under the especial management of God. These things form a part of his
providential management of the world.

Maketh grass to grow upon the mountains - After this clause the Vulgate,
the Septuagint, Ethiopic, Arabic, and Anglo-Saxon, add, and herb for the
service of man. It appears that a hemistich, or half-line, has been lost
from the Hebrew text; which, according to the above Versions, must have
stood thus: ועשב לעבדת האדם veeseb laabodath haadam, as in [Psa
104:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#014.md) : "And herbage for the service
of mankind."

[Psalms 147:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 147:10</span></span>

He delighteth not - The horse, among all animals, is most delighted in
by man for beauty, strength, and fleetness. And a man's legs, if well
proportioned, are more admired than even the finest features of his
face. Though God has made these, yet they are not his peculiar delight.

[Psalms 147:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 147:11</span></span>

The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him - That are truly
religious.

In those that hope is his mercy - Who are just beginning to seek the
salvation of their souls. Even the cry of the penitent is pleasing in
the ear of the Lord. With this verse the hundred and forty-sixth Psalm
ends in all the Versions, except the Chaldee. And the hundred and
forty-seventh commences with the [Psa
147:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#012.md). I believe these to be two
distinct Psalms. The subjects of them are not exactly the same, though
something similar; and they plainly refer to different periods.

[Psalms 147:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 147:13</span></span>

He hath strengthened the bars of thy gates - He has enabled thee to
complete the walls of Jerusalem. From the former part of the Psalm it
appears the walls were then to progress; from this part, they appear to
be completed, and provisions to be brought into the city, to support its
inhabitants. The gates were set up and well secured by bars, so that the
grain, etc., was in safety.

[Psalms 147:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 147:14</span></span>

He maketh peace - They were now no longer troubled with the Samaritans,
Moabites, etc.

[Psalms 147:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 147:15</span></span>

He sendeth forth has commandment - His substantial word. It is here
personified, מימרא meymra, Chaldee; and appears to be a very active
agent running every where, and performing the purposes of his will.

[Psalms 147:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 147:16</span></span>

He giveth snow like wool - Falling down in large flakes; and in this
state nothing in nature has a nearer resemblance to fine white wool.

Scattereth the hoar frost like ashes - Spreading it over the whole face
of nature.

[Psalms 147:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 147:17</span></span>

He casteth forth his ice - קרחו korcho, (probably hailstones), like
crumbs.

Who can stand before his cold? - At particular times the cold in the
east is so very intense as to kill man and beast. Jacobus de Vitriaco,
one of the writers in the Gesta Dei per Francos, says, that in an
expedition in which he was engaged against Mount Tabor, on the 24th of
December, the cold was so intense that many of the poor people, and the
beasts of burden, died by it. And Albertus Aquensis, another of these
writers, speaking of the cold in Judea, says, that thirty of the people
who attended Baldwin 1: in the mountainous districts near the Dead Sea,
were killed by it; and that in that expedition they had to contend with
horrible hail and ice, with unheard-of snow and rain. From thls we find
that the winters are often very severe in Judea; and in such cases as
the above, we may well call out, "Who can stand against his cold!"

[Psalms 147:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 147:18</span></span>

He sendeth out his word - He gives a command: the south wind blows; the
thaw takes place; and the ice and snow being liquefied, the waters flow,
where before they were bound up by the ice.

[Psalms 147:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 147:19</span></span>

He showeth his word unto Jacob - To no nation of the world beside had
God given a revelation of his will.

[Psalms 147:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 147:20</span></span>

And as for his judgments - The wondrous ordinances of his law, no nation
had known them; and consequently, did not know the glorious things in
futurity to which they referred.
