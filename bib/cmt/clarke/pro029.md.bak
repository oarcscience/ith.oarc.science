### [Proverbs Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">pro 29:0</span></span>

We must not despise correction. The prudent king. The flatterer. The
just judge. Contend not with a fool. The prince who opens his ears to
reports. The poor and the deceitful. The pious king. The insolent
servant. The humiliation of the proud. Of the partner of a thief. The
fear of man. The Lord the righteous Judge.

[Proverbs 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 29:1</span></span>

Hardeneth his neck - Becomes stubborn and obstinate.

[Proverbs 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 29:3</span></span>

But he that keepeth company - רעה roeh, he that feedeth harlots, יאבד
yeabed, shall utterly destroy his substance. Has there ever been a
single case to the contrary?

[Proverbs 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 29:4</span></span>

He that receiveth gifts - This was notoriously the case in this kingdom,
before the passing of the Magna Charta, or great charter of liberties.
Hence that article in it, Nulli vendemus justitiam; "We will not sell
justice to any." I have met with cases in our ancient records where, in
order to get his right, a man was obliged almost to ruin himself in
presents to the king, queen, and their favourites, to get the case
decided in his favor.

[Proverbs 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 29:5</span></span>

Spreadeth a net for his feet - Beware of a flatterer; he does not
flatter merely to please you, but to deceive you and profit himself.

[Proverbs 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 29:9</span></span>

Whether he rage or laugh - Coverdale translates, "Yf a wyse man go to
lawe with a foole, whether he deale with him frendly or roughly he
geteth no rest."

[Proverbs 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 29:11</span></span>

A fool uttereth all his mind - A man should be careful to keep his own
secret, and never tell his whole mind upon any subject, while there are
other opinions yet to be delivered; else, if he speak again, he must go
over his old ground; and as he brings out nothing new, he injures his
former argument.

[Proverbs 29:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 29:12</span></span>

If a ruler hearken to lies - Wherever the system of espionage is
permitted to prevail, there the system of falsity is established; for he
who is capable of being a spy and informer, is not only capable of
telling and swearing lies, but also of cutting his king's or even his
father's throat. I have seen cases, where the same spy received pay from
both parties, and deceived both.

[Proverbs 29:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 29:13</span></span>

The poor and the deceitful man - It is difficult to fix the meaning of
תככים techachim, which we here render the deceitful man. The Targum has,
"The poor and the man of Little Wealth." The Septuagint, "The usurer and
the Debtor." The Vulgate, "The poor and Creditor." Coverdale, "The poor
and the Lender." Others, "The poor and the Rich;" "The poor and the
Oppressors." I suppose the meaning may be the same as in [Pro
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#002) (note.md): "The rich and the poor
meet together; the Lord is the Maker of them all." Where see the note.

[Proverbs 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 29:16</span></span>

When the wicked are multiplied - That, in the multiplication of the
wicked transgression is increased, requires no proof; but an important
doctrine attaches to this. On this account wicked nations and wicked
families are cut off and rooted out. Were it not so righteousness would
in process of time be banished from the earth. This will account for
many of the numerous instances in which whole families fail.

[Proverbs 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 29:18</span></span>

Where there is no vision - My old MS. Bible, following the Vulgate,
translates: Whan prophecye schal failen, the peple schal ben to
scatered. Where Divine revelation, and the faithful preaching of the
sacred testimonies, are neither reverenced nor attended, the ruin of
that land is at no great distance.

But he that keepeth the law, happy is he - Go how it may with others, he
shall be safe. So our Lord: "Blessed are they who hear the word of God,
and keep it."

[Proverbs 29:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 29:21</span></span>

He that delicately bringeth up his servant - Such persons are generally
forgetful of their obligations, assume the rights and privileges of
children, and are seldom good for any thing.

[Proverbs 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 29:22</span></span>

An angry man stirreth up strife - His spirit begets its like wherever he
goes.

And a furious man aboundeth in transgression - His furious spirit is
always carrying him into extremes, and each of these is a transgression.

[Proverbs 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 29:23</span></span>

A man's pride shall bring him low - A proud man is universally despised,
and such are often exposed to great mortifications.

[Proverbs 29:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 29:24</span></span>

Hateth his own soul - נפשו naphsho, his life, as the outraged law may at
any time seize on and put him to death.

He heareth cursing - אלה alah, the execration or adjuration, (for all
culprits were charged, as before God, to tell the truth), ולא יגד velo
yagpid, but He will not tell It. He has no fear of God, nor reverence
for an oath, because his heart is hardened through the deceitfulness of
sin.

[Proverbs 29:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 29:25</span></span>

The fear of man bringeth a snare - How often has this led weak men,
though sincere in their general character, to deny their God, and abjure
his people! See the case of Peter; and learn from this, O reader, that
where the mighty have been slain, thou wilt fall, unless thou call on
the Strong for strength, and for courage to use it. Be not ashamed of
Jesus nor of his people, nor of his cross. Glory in this, that thou
knowest him, art joined to them, and art counted worthy to bear it.

[Proverbs 29:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 29:26</span></span>

Many seek the ruler's favor - To be screened from the punishment
determined by the law; but should he grant the favor sought, and pardon
the criminal, this takes not away his guilt in the sight of God, from
whom all just judgment proceeds.

[Proverbs 29:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 29:27</span></span>

And he that is upright in the way - "But as for those that be in the
right waye, the wicked hate them." - Coverdale.

To this verse the Vulgate adds the following: Verbum custodiens filius
extra perditionem erit; "The son that keeps the word shall not fall into
perdition." This is not in all copies of the Vulgate: but it was in that
from which my old MS. Bible was made, where it is thus translated: The
sone keping the worde schal ben out of perdicyon. I believe verbum here
is intended for the Divine word; the revelation from God.
