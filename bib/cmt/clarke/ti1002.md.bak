### [1 Timothy Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001.md)

[1 Timothy](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ti1 2:0</span></span>

Prayer, supplication, and thanksgiving, must be made for all men;
because God will that all should be saved, [Ti1
2:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001.md). There is but one God and one
Mediator, [Ti1 2:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005.md). How men should
pray, [Ti1 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#008.md). How women should adorn
themselves, [Ti1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#009.md), [Ti1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#010.md). They are not suffered to teach,
nor to nor to usurp authority over men, [Ti1
2:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#011.md). How they may expect to be
saved in child-bearing, [Ti1 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#015.md).

[1 Timothy 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti1 2:1</span></span>

I exhort - that, first of all - Prayer for the pardon of sin, and for
obtaining necessary supplies of grace, and continual protection from
God, with gratitude and thanksgiving for mercies already received, are
duties which our sinful and dependent state renders absolutely
necessary; and which should be chief in our view, and first of all
performed. It is difficult to know the precise difference between the
four words used here by the apostle. They are sometimes distinguished
thus: -

Supplications - Δεησεις· Prayers for averting evils of every kind.

Prayers - Προσευχας· Prayers for obtaining the good things, spiritual
and temporal, which ourselves need.

Intercessions - Εντευξεις· Prayers in behalf of others.

Giving of thanks - Ευχαριστιας· Praises to God, as the parent of all
good, for all the blessings which we and others have received. It is
probable that the apostle gives directions here for public worship; and
that the words may be thus paraphrased: "Now, I exhort first of all
that, in the public assemblies, deprecations of evils, and supplications
for such good things as are necessary, and intercessions for their
conversion, and thanksgiving for mercies, be offered in behalf of all
men - for heathens as well as for Christians, and for enemies as well as
for friends." See Macknight.

[1 Timothy 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ti1 2:2</span></span>

For kings - As it is a positive maxim of Christianity to pray for all
secular governors, so it has ever been the practice of Christians. When
St. Cyprian defended himself before the Roman proconsul, he said: Hunc
(Deum) deprecamur-pro nobis et pro omnibus hominibus; et pro
incolumitate ipsorum Imperatorum. "We pray to God, not only for
ourselves, but for all mankind, and particularly for the emperors."
Tertullian, in his Apology, is more particular: Oramus pro omnibus
Imperatoribus, vitam illis prolixam, imperium securum, domum tutam,
exercitus fortes, senatum fidelem, populum probum, orbem quietum, et
quaecunque hominis et Caesaris vota sunt. Apol., cap. 30. "We pray for
all the emperors, that God may grant them long life, a secure
government, a prosperous family, vigorous troops, a faithful senate, an
obedient people; that the whole world may be in peace; and that God may
grant, both to Caesar and to every man, the accomplishment of their just
desires."

So Origen: Ευχομεθα τους βασιλεις και αρχοντας μετα της βασιλικης
δυναμεως και σωφρονα τον λογισμον εχοντας εὑρεθηναι. Cont. Cels., lib.
viii. "We pray for kings and rulers, that with their royal authority
they may be found possessing a wise and prudent mind." Indeed they
prayed even for those by whom they were persecuted. If the state be not
in safety, the individual cannot be secure; self-preservation,
therefore, should lead men to pray for the government under which they
live. Rebellions and insurrections seldom terminate even in political
good; and even where the government is radically bad, revolutions
themselves are most precarious and hazardous. They who wish such
commotions would not be quiet under the most mild and benevolent
government.

That we may lead a quiet and peaceable life - We thus pray for the
government that the public peace may be preserved. Good rulers have
power to do much good; we pray that their authority may be ever
preserved and well directed. Bad rulers have power to do much evil; we
pray that they may be prevented from thus using their power. So that,
whether the rulers be good or bad, prayer for them is the positive duty
of all Christians; and the answer to their prayers, in either ease, will
be the means of their being enabled to lead a quiet and peaceable life
in all godliness and honesty.

[1 Timothy 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ti1 2:3</span></span>

This is good and acceptable - Prayer for all legally constituted
authorities is good in itself, because useful to ourselves and to the
public at large, and it is acceptable in the sight of God our Savior;
and this is its highest sanction and its highest character: it is good;
it is well pleasing to God.

[1 Timothy 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ti1 2:4</span></span>

Who will have all men to be saved - Because he wills the salvation of
all men; therefore, he wills that all men should be prayed for. In the
face of such a declaration, how can any Christian soul suppose that God
ever unconditionally and eternally reprobated any man? Those who can
believe so, one would suppose, can have little acquaintance either with
the nature of God, or the bowels of Christ.

And to come unto the knowledge of the truth - The truth - the Gospel of
Christ, should be proclaimed to them; and it is the duty of all who know
it, to diffuse it far and wide, and when it is made known, then it is
the duty of those who hear it to acknowledge and receive it. This is the
proper import of the original word, that they may come, εις επιγνωσιν
αληθειας, to the acknowledgment of the truth - that they may receive it
as the truth, and make it the rule of their faith, the model and
director of their life and actions.

[1 Timothy 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ti1 2:5</span></span>

There is one God - Who is the maker, governor, and preserver of all men,
of every condition, and of every nation, and equally wills the salvation
of all.

And one mediator - The word μεσιτης, mediator, signifies, literally, a
middle person, one whose office it is to reconcile two parties at
enmity; and hence Suidas explains it by ειρηνοποιος, a peace-maker. God
was offended with the crimes of men; to restore them to his peace, Jesus
Christ was incarnated; and being God and man, both God and men met in
and were reconciled by him. But this reconciliation required a sacrifice
on the part of the peace-maker or mediator; hence what follows.

[1 Timothy 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ti1 2:6</span></span>

Who gave himself a ransom - The word λυτρον signifies a ransom paid for
the redemption of a captive; and αντιλυτρον, the word used here, and
applied to the death of Christ, signifies that ransom which consists in
the exchange of one person for another, or the redemption of life by
life; or, as Schleusner has expressed it in his translation of these
words, Qui morte sua omnes liberavit a vitiositatis vi et poenis, a
servitute quassi et miseria peccatorum. "He who by his death has
redeemed all from the power and punishment of vice, from the slavery and
misery of sinners." As God is the God and father of all, (for there is
but one God, [Ti1 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005).md), and Jesus
Christ the mediator of all, so he gave himself a ransom for all; i.e.,
for all that God made, consequently for every human soul; unless we
could suppose that there are human souls of which God is not the
Creator; for the argument of the apostle is plainly this:

1\. There is one God;

2\. This God is the Creator of all;

3\. He has made a revelation of his kindness to all;

4\. He will have all men to be saved, and come unto the knowledge of the
truth; and

5\. He has provided a mediator for all, who has given himself a ransom
for all. As surely as God has created all men, so surely has Jesus
Christ died for all men. This is a truth which the nature and revelation
of God unequivocally proclaim.

To be testified in due time - The original words, το μαρτυριον καιροις
ιδιοις, are not very clear, and have been understood variously. The most
authentic copies of the printed Vulgate have simply, Testimonium
temporibus suis; which Calmet translates: Rendant ainsi temoignage au
tems marqu; "Thus rendering testimony at the appointed time." Dr.
Macknight thus: Of which the testimony is in its proper season.
Wakefield thus: "That testimony reserved to its proper time"
Rosenmullen: Haec est doctrina, temporibus suis reservata. "This is the
doctrine which is reserved for its own times;" that is, adds he, quoe
suo tempore in omni terrarum orbe tradetur, "the doctrine which in its
own time shall be delivered to all the inhabitants of the earth." Here
he translates μαρτυριον, doctrine; and contends that this, not
testimony, is its meaning, not only in this passage, but in [Co1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#006.md); [Co1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001.md), etc. Instead of μαρτυριον,
testimony, one MS., Cod. Kk., vi. 4, in the public library, Cambridge,
has, μυστηριον, mystery; but this is not acknowledged by any other MS.,
nor by any version. In D\*FG the whole clause is read thus: οὑ το
μαρτυριον καιροις ιδιοις εδοθη· The testimony of which was given in its
own times. This is nearly the reading which was adopted in the first
printed copies of the Vulgate. One of them now before me reads the
passage thus: Cujus testimonium temporibus suis confirmatum est. "The
testimony of which is confirmed in its own times." This reading was
adopted by Pope Sixtus V., in the famous edition published by him; but
was corrected to the reading above, by Pope Clement VIII. And this was
rendered literally by our first translator: Whos witnessinge is
confermyd in his timis. This appears to be the apostle's meaning: Christ
gave himself a ransom for all. This, in the times which seemed best to
the Divine wisdom, was to be testified to every nation, and people, and
tongue. The apostles had begun this testimony; and, in the course of the
Divine economy, it has ever since been gradually promulgated; and at
present runs with a more rapid course than ever.

[1 Timothy 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ti1 2:7</span></span>

I am ordained a preacher - I am set apart, ετεθην, appointed. The word
does not imply any imposition of hands by either bishop or presbytery,
as is vulgarly supposed.

I speak the truth in Christ - As I have received my commission from him,
so I testify his truth. I did not run before I was sent; and I speak
nothing but what I have received.

A teacher of the Gentiles - Being specially commissioned to preach the
Gospel, not to the Jews, but to the nations of the world.

In faith and verity - Faithfully and truly; preaching the Truth, the
whole Truth, and nothing but the Truth; and this fervently,
affectionately, and perseveringly.

Instead of εν πιστει, in faith, the Cod. Alexand. has εν πνευματι, in
spirit. "A teacher of the Gentiles in spirit and truth."

[1 Timothy 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ti1 2:8</span></span>

I will therefore - Seeing the apostle had his authority from Christ, and
spoke nothing but what he received from him, his βουλομαι, I will, is
equal to I command.

That men pray - That is, for the blessings promised in this testimony of
God. For, although God has provided them, yet he will not give them to
such as will not pray. See the note on [Ti1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001.md), the subject of which is here
resumed.

Everywhere - Εν παντι τοπῳ· In every place. That they should always have
a praying heart, and this will ever find a praying place. This may refer
to a Jewish superstition. They thought, at first, that no prayer could
be acceptable that was not offered at the temple at Jerusalem; afterward
this was extended to the Holy Land; but, when they became dispersed
among the nations, they built oratories or places of prayer, principally
by rivers and by the seaside; and in these they were obliged to allow
that public prayer might be legally offered, but nowhere else. In
opposition to this, the apostle, by the authority of Christ, commands
men to pray everywhere; that all places belong to God's dominions; and,
as he fills every place, in every place he may be worshipped and
glorified. As to ejaculatory prayer, they allowed that this might be
performed standing, sitting, leaning, lying, walking by the way, and
during their labor. Beracoth, fol. xi. 1. And yet in some other places
they teach differently. See Schoettgen.

Lifting up holy hands - It was a common custom, not only among the Jews,
but also among the heathens, to lift up or spread out their arms and
hands in prayer. It is properly the action of entreaty and request; and
seems to be an effort to embrace the assistance requested. But the
apostle probably alludes to the Jewish custom of laying their hands on
the head of the animal which they brought for a sin-offering, confessing
their sins, and then giving up the life of the animal as an expiation
for the sins thus confessed. And this very notion is conveyed in the
original term επαιροντας, from αιρω to lift up, and επι, upon or over.
This shows us how Christians should pray. They should come to the altar;
set God before their eyes; humble themselves for their sins; bring as a
sacrifice the Lamb of God; lay their hands on this sacrifice; and by
faith offer it to God in their souls' behalf, expecting salvation
through his meritorious death alone.

Without wrath - Having no vindictive feeling against any person;
harbouring no unforgiving spirit, while they are imploring pardon for
their own offenses.

The holy hands refer to the Jewish custom of washing their hands before
prayer; this was done to signify that they had put away all sin, and
purposed to live a holy life.

And doubting - Διαλογισμου or διαλογισμων, as in many MSS., reasonings,
dialogues. Such as are often felt by distressed penitents and timid
believers; faith, hope, and unbelief appearing to hold a disputation and
controversy in their own bosoms, in the issue of which unbelief
ordinarily triumphs. The apostle therefore wills them to come,
implicitly relying on the promises of God, and the sacrifice and
mediation of Jesus Christ.

[1 Timothy 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ti1 2:9</span></span>

In like manner also - That is, he wills or commands what follows, as he
had commanded what went before.

That women adorn themselves - Και τας γυναικας ες καταστολῃ κοσμιῳ. The
apostle seems to refer here to different parts of the Grecian and Roman
dress. The στολη, stola, seems to have been originally very simple. It
was a long piece of cloth, doubled in the middle, and sewed up on both
sides, leaving room only for the arms; at the top, a piece was cut out,
or a slit made, through which the head passed. It hung down to the feet,
both before and behind, and was girded with the zona round the body,
just under the breasts. It was sometimes made with, sometimes without,
sleeves; and, that it might sit the better, it was gathered on each
shoulder with a band or buckle. Some of the Greek women wore them open
on each side, from the bottom up above the knee, so as to discover a
part of the thigh. These were termed φαινομηριδες, showers (discoverers)
of the thigh; but it was, in general, only young girls or immodest women
who wore them thus.

The καταστολη seems to have been the same as the pallium or mantle,
which, being made nearly in the form of the stola, hung down to the
waist, both in back and front, was gathered on the shoulder with a band
or buckle, had a hole or slit at top for the head to pass through, and
hung loosely over the stola, without being confined by the zona or
girdle. Representations of these dresses may be seen in Lens' Costume
des Peuples de l'Antiquit, fig. 11, 12, 13, and 16. A more modest and
becoming dress than the Grecian was never invented; it was, in a great
measure, revived in England about the year 1805, and in it, simplicity,
decency, and elegance were united; but it soon gave place to another
mode, in which frippery and nonsense once more prevailed. It was too
rational to last long; and too much like religious simplicity to be
suffered in a land of shadows, and a world of painted outsides.

With shamefacedness and sobriety - The stola, catastola, girdle, etc.,
though simple in themselves, were often highly ornamented both with gold
and precious stones; and, both among the Grecian and Roman women, the
hair was often crisped and curled in the most variegated and complex
manner. To this the apostle alludes when he says: Μη εν πλεγμασιν, η
χρυσῳ, η μαργαριταις, η ἱματισμῳ πολυτελει· Not with plaited hair, or
gold, or pearls, or costly raiment. The costly raiment might refer to
the materials out of which the raiment was made, and to the workmanship;
the gold and pearls, to the ornaments on the raiment.

With shame-facedness or modesty, μετα αιδους. This would lead them to
avoid every thing unbecoming or meretricious in the mode or fashion of
their dress.

With sobriety, μετα σωφροσυνης. Moderation would lead them to avoid all
unnecessary expense. They might follow the custom or costume of the
country as to the dress itself, for nothing was ever more becoming than
the Grecian stola, catastola, and zona; but they must not imitate the
extravagance of those who, through impurity or littleness of mind,
decked themselves merely to attract the eye of admiration, or set in
lying action the tongue of flattery. Woman has been invidiously defined:
An animal fond of dress. How long will they permit themselves to be thus
degraded?

Those beautiful lines of Homer, in which he speaks of the death of
Euphorbus, who was slain by Menelaus, show how anciently the Grecians
plaited and adorned their hair: -

Αντικρυ δ' απαλοιο δι' αυχενος ηλυθ' ακωκη·

Δουπησεν δε πεσων, αραβησε δε τευχε' επ' αυτῳ.

Αἱματι οἱ δευοντο κομαι, Χαριτεσσιν ὁμοιαι,

Πλοχμοι θ' οἱ χρυσῳ τε και αργυρῳ εσφηκωντο.

Il. xvii., ver. 49.

Wide through the neck appears the ghastly wound;

Prone sinks the warrior, and his arms rebound.

The shining circlets of his golden hair,

Which e'en the Graces might be proud to wear,

Instarr'd with gems and gold bestrew the shore,

With dust dishonor'd, and deform'd with gore.

Pope.

Or thus, more literally: -

Sounding he fell; loud rang his batter'd arms.

His locks, which e'en the Graces might have own'd,

Blood sullied, and his ringlets wound about

With twine of gold and silver, swept the dust.

Cowper.

The extravagance to which the Grecian and Asiatic women went in their
ornaments might well be a reason for the apostle's command.

Kypke, however, denies that any particular article of dress is intended
here, and says that καταστολη is to be understood as coming from
καταστελλω, to restrain, repress; and he refers it to that government of
the mind, or moderation which women should exercise over their dress and
demeanour in general, and every thing that may fall under the
observation of the senses. All this, undoubtedly, the apostle had in
view.

When either women or men spend much time, cost, and attention on
decorating their persons, it affords a painful proof that within there
is little excellence, and that they are endeavoring to supply the want
of mind and moral good by the feeble and silly aids of dress and
ornament. Were religion out of the question, common sense would say in
all these things: Be decent; but be moderate and modest.

[1 Timothy 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ti1 2:10</span></span>

But (which becometh, etc. - That is: Good works are the only ornaments
with which women professing Christianity should seek to be adorned. The
Jewish matrons were accustomed to cry to the bride: "There is no need of
paint, no need of antimony, no need of braided hair; she herself is most
beautiful." The eastern women use a preparation of antimony, which they
apply both to the eyes and eyelids, and by which the eye itself acquires
a wonderful lustre.

[1 Timothy 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ti1 2:11</span></span>

Let the woman learn in silence - This is generally supposed to be a
prohibition of women's preaching. I have already said what I judge
necessary on this subject in the notes on [Co1
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#005.md), etc., and [Co1
14:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#034) (note.md), [Co1
14:35](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#035) (note.md); to which places I beg
leave to refer the reader.

[1 Timothy 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ti1 2:12</span></span>

Nor to usurp authority - A woman should attempt nothing, either in
public or private, that belongs to man as his peculiar function. This
was prohibited by the Roman laws: In multis juris nostri articulis
deterior est conditio foeminarum quam masculorun,; l. 9, Pap. Lib. 31,
Quaest. Foeminoe ab omnibus officiis civilibus vel publicis remotae
sunt; et ideo nec judicis esse possunt, nec magistratum gerere, nec
postulare, nec pro alio invenire, nec procuratores existere; l. 2, de
Reg. Juris. Ulp. Lib. i. Ad Sab. - Vid. Poth. Pand. Justin., vol. i. p.
13.

"In our laws the condition of women is, in many respects, worse than
that of men. Women are precluded from all public offices; therefore they
cannot be judges, nor execute the function of magistrates; they cannot
sue, plead, nor act in any case, as proxies." They were under many other
disabilities, which may be seen in different places of the Pandects.

But to be in silence - It was lawful for men in public assemblies to ask
questions, or even interrupt the speaker when there was any matter in
his speech which they did not understand; but this liberty was not
granted to women. See the note on [Co1
14:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#034.md), [Co1
14:35](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#035) (note.md).

[1 Timothy 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ti1 2:13</span></span>

For Adam was first formed, then Eve - And by this very act God designed
that he should have the pre-eminence. God fitted man, by the robust
construction of his body, to live a public life, to contend with
difficulties, and to be capable of great exertions. The structure of
woman's body plainly proves that she was never designed for those
exertions required in public life. In this the chief part of the natural
inferiority of woman is to be sought.

[1 Timothy 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ti1 2:14</span></span>

Adam was not deceived - It does not appear that Satan attempted the man;
the woman said: The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. Adam received
the fruit from the hand of his wife; he knew he was transgressing, he
was not deceived; however, she led the way, and in consequence of this
she was subjected to the domination of her husband: Thy desire shall be
to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee; [Gen
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#016.md). There is a Greek verse, but it
is not English law, that speaks a language nearly similar to that above:
-

Γυναικι δ' αρχειν ου διδωσιν ἡ φυσις.

For nature suffers not a woman's rule.

God has not only rendered her unfit for it, but he has subjected her,
expressly, to the government of the man.

[1 Timothy 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ti1 2:15</span></span>

She shalt be saved in child-bearing - Σωθησεται δε δια της τεκνογονιας·
She shall be saved through child-bearing - she shall be saved by means,
or through the instrumentality, of child-bearing or of bringing forth a
child. Amidst the different opinions given of the meaning of this very
singular text, that of Dr. Macknight appears to me the most probable,
which I shall give in his paraphrase and note.

"However, though Eve was first in the transgression, and brought death
on herself, her husband, and all her posterity, the female sex shall be
saved (equally with the male) through child-bearing - through bringing
forth the Savior, if they live in faith, and love, and chastity, with
that sobriety which I have been recommending.

"The word σωθησεται, saved, in this verse refers to ἡ γυνη, the woman,
in the foregoing verse, which is certainly Eve. But the apostle did not
mean to say that she alone was to be saved through child-bearing, but
that all her posterity, whether male or female, are to be saved through
the child-bearing of a woman; as is evident from his adding, If they
live in faith and love and holiness, with sobriety. For safety in
child-bearing does not depend on that condition at all; since many pious
women die in child-bearing, while others of a contrary character are
preserved. The salvation of the human race, through child-bearing, was
intimated in the sentence passed on the serpent, [Gen
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015.md) : I will put enmity between thee
and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed. It shall bruise thy
head. Accordingly, the Savior being conceived in the womb of his mother
by the power of the Holy Ghost, he is truly the seed of the woman who
was to bruise the head of the serpent; and a woman, by bringing him
forth, has been the occasion of our salvation." This is the most
consistent sense, for in the way in which it is commonly understood it
does not apply. There are innumerable instances of women dying in
child-bed who have lived in faith and charity and holiness, with
sobriety; and equally numerous instances of worthless women, slaves to
different kinds of vices, who have not only been saved in child-bearing,
but have passed through their travail with comparatively little pain;
hence that is not the sense in which we should understand the apostle.
Yet it must be a matter of great consolation and support, to all pious
women labouring of child, to consider that, by the holy virgin's
child-bearing, salvation is provided for them and the whole human race;
and that, whether they die or live, though their own child-bearing can
contribute nothing to their salvation, yet he who was born of a woman
has purchased them and the whole human race by his blood.

If they continue - Εαν μεινωσιν is rightly translated, if they live; for
so it signifies in other passages, particularly [Phi
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#025.md). The change in the number of the
verb from the singular to the plural, which is introduced here, was
designed by the apostle to show that he does not speak of Eve; nor of
any particular woman, but of the whole sex. See Macknight.

Without faith it is impossible to please God, or to be saved; and
without love it will be impossible to obey. Faith and Love are
essentially necessary to holiness and sobriety; and unless both men and
women live in these, they cannot, scripturally, expect to dwell with God
for ever. Some foolish women have supposed, from this verse, that the
very act of bringing forth children shall entitle them to salvation; and
that all who die in childbed infallibly go to glory! Nothing can be more
unfounded than this; faith, love, holiness, and sobriety, are as
absolutely requisite for the salvation of every daughter of Eve, as they
are for the salvation of every son of Adam. Pain and suffering neither
purify nor make atonement. On the mercy of God, in Christ, dispensing
remission of sins and holiness, both men and women may confidently rely
for salvation; but on nothing else. Let her that readeth understand.

On the subject of dress I will conclude in the words of a late writer:
"What harm does it do to adorn ourselves with gold, or pearls, or costly
array, suppose we can afford it? The first harm it does is, it engenders
pride; and, where it is already, increases it. Nothing is more natural
than to think ourselves better because we are dressed in better clothes.
One of the old heathens was so well apprised of this, that when he had a
spite to a poor man, and had a mind to turn his head; he made him a
present of a suit of fine clothes.

Eutrapelus cuicunque nocere volebat,

Vestimenta dabat pretiosa.

He could not then but imagine himself to be as much better, as he was
finer, than his neighbor; inferring the superior value of his person
from the value of his clothes." - Rev. J. Wesley's Sermons.
