### [Matthew Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#001.md)

[Matthew](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mat 23:0</span></span>

The character of the scribes and Pharisees, and directions to the people
and the disciples to receive the law from them, but not to follow their
bad example, [Mat 23:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#001.md). The
disciples exhorted to humility, [Mat
23:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#008.md). Different woes pronounced
against the scribes and Pharisees for their intolerance, [Mat
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#013.md); rapacity, [Mat
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#014.md); false zeal, [Mat
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#015.md); superstition in oaths and
tithes, [Mat 23:16-23](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#016.md); hypocrisy, [Mat
23:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#024.md). Their cruelty, [Mat
23:29-32](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#029.md). Their persecution of the
apostles, etc. Their destruction foretold, [Mat
23:33-36](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#033.md). Christ's lamentation over
Jerusalem, [Mat 23:37-39](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037.md).

[Matthew 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 23:2</span></span>

The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat - Εκαθισαν. - They sat
there formerly by Divine appointment: they sit there now by Divine
permission. What our Lord says here refers to their expounding the
Scriptures, for it was the custom of the Jewish doctors to sit while
they expounded the law and prophets, ([Mat
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#001.md); [Luk
4:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#020).md), and to stand up when they
read them.

By the seat of Moses, we are to understand authority to teach the law.
Moses was the great teacher of the Jewish people; and the scribes, etc.,
are here represented as his successors.

[Matthew 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 23:3</span></span>

All therefore whatsoever - That is, all those things which they read out
of the law and prophets, and all things which they teach consistently
with them. This must be our Lord's meaning: he could not have desired
them to do every thing, without restriction, which the Jewish doctors
taught; because himself warns his disciples against their false
teaching, and testifies that they had made the word of God of none
effect by their traditions. See [Mat
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#006.md), etc. Besides, as our Lord speaks
here in the past tense - whatsoever they Have commanded, ὁσα ειπωσιν, he
may refer to the teaching of a former period, when they taught the way
of God in truth, or were much less corrupted than they were now.

[Matthew 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 23:4</span></span>

They bind heavy burdens - They are now so corrupt that they have added
to the ceremonies of the law others of their own invention, which are
not only burdensome and oppressive, but have neither reason, expediency,
nor revelation, to countenance them. In a word, like all their
successors in spirit to the present day, they were severe to others, but
very indulgent to themselves.

[Matthew 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 23:5</span></span>

All their works they do for to be seen of men - In pointing out the
corruptions of these men, our Lord gives us the distinguishing
characteristics of all false teachers, whether Jewish or Christian.

1\. They live not according to the truths they preach. They say, and do
not, [Mat 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#003.md).

2\. They are severe to others, point out the narrowest road to heaven,
and walk in the broad road themselves. They bind on burdens, etc., [Mat
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#004.md).

3\. They affect to appear righteous, and are strict observers of certain
rites, etc., while destitute of the power of godliness. They make broad
their phylacteries, etc., [Mat 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#005.md).

4\. They love worldly entertainments, go to feast wherever they are
asked, and seek Church preferments. They love the chief places at
feasts, and chief seats in the synagogues, [Mat
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#006.md).

5\. They love and seek public respect and high titles, salutations in
the market-place, (for they are seldom in their studies), and to be
called of men rabbi - eminent teacher, though they have no title to it,
either from the excellence or fruit of their teaching. When these marks
are found in a man who professes to be a minister of Christ, charity
itself will assert he is a thief and a robber - he has climbed over the
wall of the sheepfold, or broken it down in order to get in.

Phylacteries - φυλακτηρια, from φυλασσω, to keep or preserve. These were
small slips of parchment or vellum, on which certain portions of the law
were written. The Jews tied these about their foreheads and arms, for
three different purposes.

1\. To put them in mind of those precepts which they should constantly
observe.

2\. To procure them reverence and respect in the sight of the heathen.
And

3\. To act as amulets or charms to drive away evil spirits.

The first use of these phylacteries is evident from their name.

The second use appears from what is said on the subject from the Gemara,
Beracoth, chap. 1., quoted by Kypke. "Whence is it proved that
phylacteries, (תפילין, tephilin), are the strength of Israel? - Ans.
From what is written, [Deu 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#010.md). All
the, people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name \[of
יהוה Jehovah\] - and they shall be afraid of thee.

The third use of them appears from the Targum, on [Sol
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#003.md) : His left hand is under my head,
etc. "The congregation of Israel hath said, I am elect above all people,
because I bind my phylacteries on my left hand, and on my head, and the
scroll is fixed to the right side of my gate, the third part of which
looks to my bed-chamber, that Daemons may not be permitted to Injure
me."

An original phylactery lies now before me. It is a piece of fine vellum,
about eighteen inches long, and an inch and quarter broad. It is divided
into four unequal compartments: in the first is written, in a very fair
character, with many apices, after the mode of the German Jews, the
first ten verses of Exod. 13; in the second compartment is written, from
the eleventh to the sixteenth verse of the same chapter, inclusive in
the third, from the fourth to the ninth verse, inclusive, of Deut. 6.,
beginning with, Hear, O Israel, etc.; in the fourth, from the thirteenth
to the twenty-first verse, inclusive, of Deut. 11.

These passages seem to be chosen in vindication of the use of the
phylactery itself, as the reader will see on consulting them: Bind them
for a Sign upon thy Hand - and for Frontlets between thy Eyes - write
them upon the Posts of thy House, and upon thy Gates; all which commands
the Jews took in the most literal sense.

Even the phylactery became an important appendage to a Pharisee's
character, insomuch that some of them wore them very broad, either that
they might have the more written on them, or that, the characters being
larger, they might be the more visible, and that they might hereby
acquire greater esteem among the common people, as being more than
ordinarily religious. For the same reason, they wore the fringes of
their garments of an unusual length. Moses had commanded ([Num
15:38](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#038.md), [Num
15:39](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#039).md) the children of Israel to put
fringes to the borders of their garments, that, when they looked upon
even these distinct threads, they might remember, not only the law in
general, but also the very minutiae, or smaller parts of all the
precepts, rites, and ceremonies, belonging to it. As these hypocrites
were destitute of all the life and power of religion within, they
endeavored to supply its place by phylacteries and fringes without. See
the note on [Exo 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#009.md).

[Matthew 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 23:7</span></span>

To be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi - רבי רבי, i.e. My teacher! my
teacher! The second rabbi is omitted by several excellent MSS., by most
of the ancient versions, and by some of the fathers. Griesbach has left
it in the text, with the note of doubtfulness.

There are three words used among the Jews as titles of dignity, which
they apply to their doctors - Rabh, Rabbi, and Rabban; each of these
terms has its particular meaning: rabban implies much more than rabbi,
and rabbi much more than rabh.

They may be considered as three degrees of comparison: rabh great, rabbi
greater, and rabban greatest. These rabbins were looked up to as
infallible oracles in religious matters, and usurped not only the place
of the law, but of God himself.

[Matthew 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 23:8</span></span>

But be not ye called Rabbi - As our Lord probably spoke in Hebrew, the
latter word rabbi, in this verse, must have been in the plural; but as
the contracted form of the plural sounds almost exactly like the
singular, the Greek writer would naturally express them both in the same
letters.

None of the prophets had ever received this title, nor any of the Jewish
doctors before the time of Hillel and Shammai, which was about the time
of our Lord; and, as disputes on several subjects had run high between
these two schools, the people were of course divided; some acknowledging
Hillel as rabbi, - infallible teacher, and others giving this title to
Shammai. The Pharisees, who always sought the honor that comes from men,
assumed the title, and got their followers to address them by it. See on
[Mat 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#003) (note.md).

One is your Master - Instead of καθηγητης, guide or leader, (the common
reading here, and which occurs in [Mat
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#010).md), the famous Vatican MS.,
upwards of fifty others, and most of the ancient versions, read
διδασκαλος, master. The most eminent critics approve of this reading
and, independently of the very respectable authority by which it is
supported, it is evident that this reading is more consistent with the
context than the other, - Be not ye called Masters, for one is your
Master.

Even Christ - Griesbach has left this out of the text, because it is
wanting in many of the most excellent MSS., versions, and fathers. Mill
and Bengel approve of the omission. It might have been brought into this
verse from [Mat 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#010.md). Our Lord
probably alludes to [Isa 54:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#013.md), All
thy children shall be taught of the Lord.

Ye are brethren - No one among you is higher than another, or can
possibly have from me any jurisdiction over the rest. Ye are, in this
respect, perfectly equal.

[Matthew 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 23:9</span></span>

Call no man your Father - Our Lord probably alludes to the Ab, or father
of the Sanhedrin, who was the next after the nasi, or president. See on
[Mat 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#021) (note.md). By which he gives
his disciples to understand that he would have no Second, after himself,
established in his Church, of which he alone was the head; and that
perfect equality must subsist among them.

[Matthew 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 23:10</span></span>

Neither be ye called masters - Καθηγηται, leaders. God is in all these
respects jealous of his honor. To him alone it belongs to guide and lead
his Church, as well as to govern and defend it. Jesus is the sole
teacher of righteousness. It is he alone, (who is the word, light, and
eternal truth), that can illuminate every created mind; and who, as
Savior and Redeemer, speaks to every heart by his Spirit.

Though the title of Rabbi, mentioned above, was comparatively recent in
the time of our Lord, yet it was in great vogue, as were the others -
father and master, mentioned in this and the following verse: some had
all three titles, for thus in Bab. Maccoth, fol. 24. It is feigned,"
says Dr. Lightfoot, "that when King Jehosaphat saw a disciple of the
wise men, he rose up out of his throne, and embraced him, and said, אבי
אבי רבי רבי מרי מרי, Abbi, Abbi! Rabbi, Rabbi! Mori, Mori! - Father,
Father! Rabbi, Rabbi! Master, Master!" Here then are the three titles
which, in [Mat 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#007.md), [Mat
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#008.md), [Mat
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#010.md), our blessed Lord condemns; and
these were titles that the Jewish doctors greatly affected.

[Matthew 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 23:11</span></span>

Your servant - Διακονος, deacon. See on [Mat
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#026) (note.md).

[Matthew 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 23:12</span></span>

Whosoever shall exalt himself, etc. - The way to arrive at the highest
degree of dignity, in the sight of God, is by being willing to become
the servant of all. Nothing is more hateful in his sight than pride; to
bring it into everlasting contempt, God was manifest in the flesh. He
who was in the likeness of God took upon him the form of a servant, and
was made in the likeness of man, and humbled himself unto death. After
this, can God look upon any proud man without abasing him? Spiritual
lordship and domination, ecclesiastical luxury, pomp, and pride, must be
an abhorrence in the sight of that God who gave the above advices to his
followers.

Another lesson, which our blessed Lord teaches here, is, that no man is
implicitly to receive the sayings, doctrines, and decisions of any man,
or number of men, in the things which concern the interests of his
immortal soul. Christ, his Spirit, and his word, are the only infallible
teachers. Every man who wishes to save his soul must search the
Scriptures, by prayer and faith. Reader, take counsel with the pious;
hear the discourses of the wise and holy: but let the book of God
ultimately fix thy creed.

[Matthew 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 23:13</span></span>

Wo unto you, scribes - I think the fourteenth and thirteenth verses
should be transposed. This transposition is authorized by some of the
best MSS., versions, and fathers. The fourteenth is wanting in the BDL.,
and in many others of inferior note, as well as in several of the
versions. Griesbach has left it out of the text, in his first edition; I
hesitated, and left it in, thus transposed. I am happy to find that a
more extensive collation of MSS., etc., afforded proof to that eminent
critic that it should be restored to its place. In the second edition,
he has transposed the two, just as I had done. The fifteenth reads best
after the thirteenth.

[Matthew 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 23:14</span></span>

Ye devour widows' houses - On this subject I am in possession of nothing
better than the following note of Dr. Whitby.

"This sect," says Josephus, (Ant. l. xvii. chap. 3), "pretended to a
more exact knowledge of the law, on which account the women were subject
to them, as pretending to be dear to God. And when Alexandra obtained
the government, (Jewish War, b. I. ch. 4), they insinuated themselves
into her favor, as being the exactest sect of the Jews, and the most
exact interpreters of the law, and, abusing her simplicity, did as they
listed, remove and dispose, bind and loose, and even cut off men. They
were in vogue for their long prayers, which they continued sometimes
three hours; that perhaps they sold them, as do the Roman priests their
masses, or pretended others should be more acceptable to God for them;
and so might spoil devout widows by the gifts or salaries they expected
from them.

Now this being only a hypocritical pretense of piety, must be hateful to
God, and so deserve a greater condemnation."

Long prayer - For proofs of long prayers and vain repetitions among
Jews, Mohammedans, and heathens, see the notes on [Mat
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#007.md).

[Matthew 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 23:13</span></span>

Ye shut up the kingdom - As a key by opening a lock gives entrance into
a house, etc., so knowledge of the sacred testimonies, manifested in
expounding them to the people, may be said to open the way into the
kingdom of heaven. But where men who are termed teachers are destitute
of this knowledge themselves, they may be said to shut this kingdom;
because they occupy the place of those who should teach, and thus
prevent the people from acquiring heavenly knowledge.

In ancient times the rabbins carried a key, which was the symbol or
emblem of knowledge. Hence it is written in Semachoth, chap. 8., "When
Rab. Samuel the little died, his key and his tablets were hung on his
tomb, because he died childless." See Schoettgen.

The kingdom of heaven here means the Gospel of Christ; the Pharisees
would not receive it themselves, and hindered the common people as far
as they could.

[Matthew 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 23:15</span></span>

Compass sea and land - A proverbial expression, similar to ours, You
leave no stone unturned; intimating that they did all in their power to
gain converts, not to God, but to their sect. These we may suppose were
principally sought for among the Gentiles, for the bulk of the Jewish
nation was already on the side of the Pharisees.

Proselyte - Προσηλυτος, a stranger, or foreigner; one who is come from
his own people and country, to sojourn with another. See the different
kinds of proselytes explained in the note on [Exo
12:43](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#043) (note.md).

The child of hell - A Hebraism for an excessively wicked person, such as
might claim hell for his mother, and the devil for his father.

Twofold - the child of - The Greek word διπλοτερον, which has generally
been translated twofold, Kypke has demonstrated to mean more deceitful.
Απλοῦς is used by the best Greek writers for simple, sincere, απλότης
for simplicity, sincerity; so διπλοῦς, deceitful, dissembling, and
διπλόη, hypocrisy, fraudulence, and διπλοτερον, more fraudulent, more
deceitful, more hypocritical. See also Suidas in Διπλοη.

Dr. Lightfoot, and others, observe, that the proselytes were considered
by the Jewish nation as the scabs of the Church, and hindered the coming
of the Messiah; and Justin Martyr observes, that "the proselytes did not
only disbelieve Christ's doctrine, but were abundantly more blasphemous
against him than the Jews themselves, endeavoring to torment and cut off
the Christians wherever they could; they being in this the instruments
of the scribes and Pharisees."

[Matthew 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 23:16</span></span>

Whosoever shall swear by the gold - The covetous man, says one, still
gives preference to the object of his lust; gold has still the first
place in his heart. A man is to be suspected when he recommends those
good works most from which he receives most advantage.

Is bound thereby, i.e. to fulfill his oath.

[Matthew 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mat 23:20</span></span>

Whoso - shall swear by the altar - As an oath always supposes a person
who witnesses it, and will punish perjury; therefore, whether they swore
by the temple or the gold, ([Mat
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#016).md), or by the altar or the gift
laid on it, ([Mat 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#018).md), the oath
necessarily supposes the God of the temple, of the altar, and of the
gifts, who witnessed the whole, and would, even in their exempt cases,
punish the perjury.

[Matthew 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 23:21</span></span>

Whoso shall swear by the temple - Perhaps it is to this custom of
swearing by the temple, that Martial alludes, lib. xi. epist. 95.

Ecce negas, jurasque mihi per templa Tonantis; Non credo; jura, Verpe,
per Anchialum.

"Behold, thou deniest, and swearest to me by the temples of Jupiter; I
will not credit thee: swear, O Jew, by the temple of Jehovah."

This word probably comes from היכל יה heical Yah, the temple of Jehovah.
This seems a better derivation than אם חי אלהים im chai Elohim, as God
liveth, though the sound of the latter is nearer to the Latin.

By him that dwelleth therein - The common reading is κατοικουντι,
dwelleth or Inhabiteth, but κατοικησαντι, dwelt or Did inhabit, is the
reading of CDEFGHKLM, eighty-six others; this reading has been adopted
in the editions of Complutum, Colineus, Bengel, and Griesbach. The
importance of this reading may be perceived by the following
considerations. In the first Jewish temple, God had graciously
condescended to manifest himself - he is constantly represented as
dwelling between the cherubim, the two figures that stood at each end of
the ark of the covenant; between whom, on the mercy seat, the lid of the
ark, a splendor of glory was exhibited, which was the symbol and proof
of the Divine presence. This the Jews called שכינה Shekinah, the
habitation of Jehovah. Now the Jews unanimously acknowledge that five
things were wanting in the second temple, which were found in the first,
viz.,

1\. The ark;

2\. The holy spirit of prophecy;

3\. The Urim and Thummim;

4\. The sacred fire; and

5\. The שכינה Shekinah.

As the Lord had long before this time abandoned the Jewish temple, and
had now made the human nature of Jesus the Shekinah, (see [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md), the Logos was made flesh,
εσκηνωσεν, and made his tabernacle - made the Shekinah, - among us), our
Lord could not, with any propriety, say that the supreme Being did now
inhabit the temple; and therefore used a word that hinted to them that
God had forsaken their temple, and consequently the whole of that
service which was performed in it, and had now opened the new and living
way to the holiest by the Messiah. But all this was common swearing;
and, whether the subject was true or false, the oath was unlawful. A
common swearer is worthy of no credit, when, even in the most solemn
manner he takes an oath before a magistrate; he is so accustomed to
stake his truth, perhaps even his soul, to things whether true or false,
that an oath cannot bind him, and indeed is as little respected by
himself as it is by his neighbor. Common swearing, and the shocking
frequency and multiplication of oaths in civil cases, have destroyed all
respect for an oath; so that men seldom feel themselves bound by it; and
thus it is useless in many cases to require it as a confirmation, in
order to end strife or ascertain truth. See the note on [Mat
5:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#037.md).

[Matthew 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 23:23</span></span>

Ye pay tithe of mint, etc. - They were remarkably scrupulous in the
performance of all the rites and ceremonies of religion, but totally
neglected the soul, spirit, and practice of godliness.

Judgment - Acting according to justice and equity towards all mankind.
Mercy - to the distressed and miserable. And faith in God as the
fountain of all righteousness, mercy, and truth. The scribes and
Pharisees neither began nor ended their works in God, nor had they any
respect unto his name in doing them. They did them to be seen of men,
and they had their reward - human applause.

These ought ye to have done, etc. - Our Lord did not object to their
paying tithe even of common pot-herbs - this did not affect the spirit
of religion; but while they did this and such like, to the utter neglect
of justice, mercy, and faith, they showed that they had no religion, and
knew nothing of its nature.

[Matthew 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 23:24</span></span>

Blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel. - This clause
should be thus translated: Ye strain out the gnat, but ye swallow down
the camel. In the common translation, Ye strain At a gnat, conveys no
sense. Indeed, it is likely to have been at first an error of the press,
At for Out, which, on examination, I find escaped in the edition of
1611, and has been regularly continued since. There is now before me,
"The Newe Testament, (both in Englyshe and in Laten), of Mayster Erasmus
translacion, imprynted by Wyllyam Powell, dwellynge in Flete strete: the
yere of our Lorde M.CCCCC.XLVII. the fyrste yere of the kynges (Edwd.
VI). moste gracious reygne." in which the verse stands thus: "Ye blinde
gides, which strayne out a gnat, and swalowe a cammel." It is the same
also in Edmund Becke's Bible, printed in London 1549, and in several
others. - Clensynge a gnatte. - MS. Eng. Bib. So Wickliff. Similar to
this is the following Arabic proverb: He eats an elephant and is choked
by a gnat.

[Matthew 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 23:25</span></span>

Ye make clean the outside - The Pharisees were exceedingly exact in
observing all the washings and purifications prescribed by the law; but
paid no attention to that inward purity which was typified by them. A
man may appear clean without, who is unclean within; but outward purity
will not avail in the sight of God, where inward holiness is wanting.

Extortion and excess - 'Αρπαγης και ακρασιας, rapine and intemperance;
but instead of ακρασιας, intemperance, many of the very best MSS.,
CEFGHKS, and more than a hundred others, the Syriac, Arabic, Ethiopic,
Slavonic, with Chrysostom, Euthym., and Theophylact, have αδικιας
injustice, which Griesbach has admitted into the text instead of
ακρασιας. The latter Syriac has both. Several MSS. and versions have
ακαθαρσιας, uncleanness; others have πλεονεξιας, covetousness; some have
πονηριας, wickedness; and two of the ancients have iniquitate, iniquity.
Suppose we put them all together, the character of the Pharisee will not
be overcharged. They were full of rapine and intemperance, injustice and
uncleanness, covetousness, wickedness, and iniquity.

[Matthew 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 23:27</span></span>

For ye are like - Παρομοιαζετε, ye exactly resemble - the parallel is
complete.

Whited sepulchres - White-washed tombs. As the law considered those
unclean who had touched any thing belonging to the dead, the Jews took
care to have their tombs white-washed each year, that, being easily
discovered, they might be consequently avoided.

[Matthew 23:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 23:28</span></span>

Even so ye also - appear righteous unto men - But what will this
appearance avail a man, when God sits in judgment upon his soul? Will
the fair reputation which he had acquired among men, while his heart was
the seat of unrighteousness, screen him from the stroke of that justice
which impartially sends all impurity and unholiness into the pit of
destruction? No. In the sin that he hath sinned, and in which he hath
died, and according to that, shall he be judged and punished; and his
profession of holiness only tends to sink him deeper into the lake which
burns with unquenchable fire. Reader! see that thy heart be right with
God.

[Matthew 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mat 23:29</span></span>

Ye build the tombs of the prophets - It appears that, through respect to
their memory, they often repaired, and sometimes beautified, the tombs
of the prophets. M. De la Valle, in his Journey to the Holy Land, says,
that when he visited the cave of Machpelah, he saw some Jews honoring a
sepulchre, for which they have a great veneration, with lighting at it
wax candles and burning perfumes. See Harmer, vol. iii. p. 416. And in
ditto, p. 424, we are informed that building tombs over those reputed
saints, or beautifying those already built, is a frequent custom among
the Mohammedans.

[Matthew 23:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mat 23:30</span></span>

We would not have been partakers - They imagined themselves much better
than their ancestors; but our Lord, who knew what they would do,
uncovers their hearts, and shows them that they are about to be more
abundantly vile than all who had ever preceded them.

[Matthew 23:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mat 23:31</span></span>

Ye be witnesses - Ye acknowledge that ye are the children of those
murderers, and ye are about to give full proof that ye are not
degenerated.

There are many who think that, had they lived in the time of our Lord,
they would not have acted towards him as the Jews did. But we can
scarcely believe that they who reject his Gospel, trample under foot his
precepts, do despite to the Spirit of his grace, love sin, and hate his
followers, would have acted otherwise to him than the murdering Jews,
had they lived in the same times.

[Matthew 23:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mat 23:32</span></span>

Fill ye up then - Notwithstanding the profession you make, ye will fill
up the measure of your fathers - will continue to walk in their way,
accomplish the fullness of every evil purpose by murdering me; and then,
when the measure of your iniquity is full, vengeance shall come upon you
to the uttermost, as it did on your rebellious ancestors. The 31st verse
should be read in a parenthesis, and then the 32d will appear to be,
what it is, an inference from the 30th.

Ye will fill up, or fill ye up - πληρωσατε· but it is manifest that the
imperative is put here for the future, a thing quite consistent with the
Hebrew idiom, and frequent in the Scriptures. So [Joh
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019.md), Destroy this temple, etc., i.e.
Ye will destroy or pull down this temple, and I will rebuild it in three
days - Ye will crucify me, and I will rise again the third day. Two good
MSS. have the word in the future tense: and my old MS. Bible has it in
the present - Ge (ye) fulfillen the mesure of youre (your) fadris.

[Matthew 23:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mat 23:33</span></span>

Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers - What a terrible stroke! - Ye are
serpents, and the offspring of serpents. This refers to [Mat
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#031.md) : they confessed that they were
the children of those who murdered the prophets; and they are now going
to murder Christ and his followers, to show that they have not
degenerated - an accursed seed, of an accursed breed. My old MS.
translates this passage oddly - Gee serpentis, fruytis of burrownyngis
of eddris that sleen her modris. There seems to be here an allusion to a
common opinion, that the young of the adder or viper which are brought
forth alive eat their way through the womb of their mothers. Hence that
ancient enigma attributed to Lactantius: -

Non possum nasci, si non occidero matrem

Occidi matrem: sed me manet exitus idem

Id mea mors faciet, quod jam mea fecit origo

Cael. Firm. Symposium, N. xv

I never can be born, nor see the day,

Till through my parent's womb I eat my way

Her I have slain; like her must yield my breath;

For that which gave me life, shall cause my death

Every person must see with what propriety this was applied to the Jews,
who were about to murder the very person who gave them their being and
all their blessings.

[Matthew 23:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mat 23:34</span></span>

Wherefore - To show how my prediction, Ye will fill up the measure of
your fathers, shall be verified, Behold, I send (I am just going to
commission them) prophets, etc. and some ye will kill, (with legal
process), and some ye will crucify, pretend to try and find guilty, and
deliver them into the hands of the Romans, who shall, through you, thus
put them to death. See on [Luk 11:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#049.md)
(note). By prophets, wise men, and scribes, our Lord intends the
evangelists, apostles, deacons, etc., who should be employed in
proclaiming his Gospel: men who should equal the ancient prophets, their
wise men, and scribes, in all the gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit.

[Matthew 23:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mat 23:35</span></span>

Upon the earth - Επι της γης, upon this land, meaning probably the land
of Judea; for thus the word is often to be understood. The national
punishment of all the innocent blood which had been shed in the land,
shall speedily come upon you, from the blood of Abel the just, the first
prophet and preacher of righteousness, [Heb
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#004.md); [Pe2
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#005.md), to the blood of Zachariah, the
son of Barachiah. It is likely that our Lord refers to the murder of
Zachariah, mentioned [Ch2 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#020.md), who
said to the people, Why transgress ye the commandments of God, so that
ye cannot prosper? Because ye have forsaken the Lord, he hath forsaken
you. And they conspired against him and stoned him - at the commandment
of the king, in the court of the house of the Lord. And when he died, he
said, The Lord look upon and require it: [Ch2
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#021.md), [Ch2
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#022.md).

But it is objected, that this Zachariah was called the son of Jehoiada,
and our Lord calls this one the son of Barachiah. Let it be observed,

1\. That double names were frequent among the Jews; and sometimes the
person was called by one, sometimes by the other. Compare [Sa1
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#001.md), with [Ch1
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#033.md), where it appears that the father
of Kish had two names, Abiel and Ner. So Matthew is called Levi; compare
[Mat 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#009.md), with [Mar
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#014.md). So Peter was also called Simon,
and Lebbeus was called Thaddeus. [Mat
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#002.md), [Mat
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#003.md).

2\. That Jerome says that, in the Gospel of the Nazarenes, it was
Jehoiada, instead of Barachiah.

3\. That Jehoiada and Barachiah have the very same meaning, the praise
or blessing of Jehovah.

4\. That as the Lord required the blood of Zachariah so fully that in a
year all the princes of Judah and Jerusalem were destroyed by the
Syrians, and Joash, who commanded the murder, slain by his own servants,
[Ch2 24:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#023.md), and their state grew
worse and worse, till at last the temple was burned, and the people
carried into captivity by Nebuzaradan: - so it should also be with the
present race. The Lord would, after the crucifixion of Christ, visit
upon them the murder of all those righteous men, that their state should
grow worse and worse, till at last the temple should be destroyed, and
they finally ruined by the Romans. See this prediction in the next
chapter: and see Dr. Whitby concerning Zachariah, the son of Barachiah.

Some think that our Lord refers, in the spirit of prophecy, to the
murder of Zacharias, son of Baruch, a rich Jew, who was judged,
condemned, and massacred in the temple by Idumean zealots, because he
was rich, a lover of liberty, and a hater of wickedness. They gave him a
mock trial; and, when no evidence could be brought against him of his
being guilty of the crime they laid to his charge, viz. a design to
betray the city to the Romans, and his judges had pronounced him
innocent, two of the stoutest of the zealots fell upon him and slew him
in the middle of the temple. See Josephus, War, b. iv. chap. 5. s. 5.
See Crevier, vol. vi. p. 172, History of the Roman Emperors. Others
imagine that Zachariah, one of the minor prophets, is meant, who might
have been massacred by the Jews; for, though the account is not come
down to us, our Lord might have it from a well known tradition in those
times. But the former opinion is every way the most probable.

Between the temple and the altar - That is, between the sanctuary and
the altar of burnt-offerings.

[Matthew 23:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mat 23:36</span></span>

Shall come upon this generation - Επι την γενεαν ταυτην, upon this race
of men, viz. the Jews. This phrase often occurs in this sense in the
evangelists.

[Matthew 23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mat 23:37</span></span>

O Jerusalem, Jerusalem -

1\. It is evident that our blessed Lord seriously and earnestly wished
the salvation of the Jews.

2\. That he did every thing that could be done, consistently with his
own perfections, and the liberty of his creatures, to effect this.

3\. That his tears over the city, [Luk
19:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#041.md), sufficiently evince his
sincerity.

4\. That these persons nevertheless perished. And

5\. That the reason was, they would not be gathered together under his
protection: therefore wrath, i.e. punishment, came upon them to the
uttermost.

From this it is evident that there have been persons whom Christ wished
to save, and bled to save, who notwithstanding perished, because they
would not come unto him, [Joh 5:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#040.md).
The metaphor which our Lord uses here is a very beautiful one. When the
hen sees a beast of prey coming, she makes a noise to assemble her
chickens, that she may cover them with her wings from the danger. The
Roman eagle is about to fall upon the Jewish state - nothing can prevent
this but their conversion to God through Christ-Jesus cries throughout
the land, publishing the Gospel of reconciliation - they would not
assemble, and the Roman eagle came and destroyed them. The hen's
affection to her brood is so very strong as to become proverbial. The
following beautiful Greek epigram, taken from the Anthologia, affords a
very fine illustration of this text.

Χειμεριαις νιφαδεσσι παλυνομενα τιθας ορνις

Τεκνοις ευναιας αμφεχεε πτερυγας

Μεσφα μεν ουρανιον κρυος ωλεσεν η γαρ εμεινεν

Αιθερος ουρανιων αντιπαλος νεφεων.

Προκνη και Μεδεια, κατ' αΐδος αιδεσθητε,

Μητερες, ορνιθων εργα διδασκομεναι

Anthol. lib. i. Titus. 87: edit. Bosch. p. 344

Beneath her fostering wing the Hen defends

Her darling offspring, while the snow descends;

Throughout the winter's day unmoved defies

The chilling fleeces and inclement skies;

Till, vanquish'd by the cold and piercing blast,

True to her charge, she perishes at last!

O Fame! to hell this fowl's affection bear;

Tell it to Progne and Medea there: -

To mothers such as those the tale unfold,

And let them blush to hear the story told! -

T. G.

This epigram contains a happy illustration, not only of our Lord's
simile, but also of his own conduct. How long had these thankless and
unholy people been the objects of his tenderest cares! For more than
2000 years, they engrossed the most peculiar regards of the most
beneficent Providence; and during the three years of our Lord's public
ministry, his preaching and miracles had but one object and aim, the
instruction and salvation of this thoughtless and disobedient people.
For their sakes, he who was rich became poor, that they through his
poverty might be rich: - for their sakes, he made himself of no
reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and became obedient
unto death, even the death of the cross! He died, that They might not
perish, but have everlasting life. Thus, to save their life, he freely
abandoned his own.

[Matthew 23:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mat 23:38</span></span>

Behold, your house - Ο οικος, the temple: - this is certainly what is
meant. It was once the Lord's temple, God's Own house; but now he says,
Your temple or house - to intimate that God had abandoned it. See the
note on [Mat 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#021.md); see also on [Luk
13:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#035) (note.md).

[Matthew 23:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">mat 23:39</span></span>

Ye shall not see me - I will remove my Gospel from you, and withdraw my
protection.

Till ye shall say, Blessed - Till after the fullness of the Gentiles is
brought in, when the word of life shall again be sent unto you; then
will ye rejoice, and bless, and praise him that cometh in the name of
the Lord, with full and final salvation for the lost sheep of the house
of Israel. See [Rom 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026.md), [Rom
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#027.md).

Our Lord plainly foresaw that, in process of time, a spiritual
domination would arise in his Church; and, to prevent its evil
influence, he leaves the strong warnings against it which are contained
in the former part of this chapter. As the religion of Christ is
completely spiritual, and the influence by which it is produced and
maintained must come from heaven; therefore, there could be no master or
head but himself: for as the Church (the assemblage of true believers)
is his body, all its intelligence, light, and life, must proceed from
him alone. Our forefathers noted this well; and this was one of the
grand arguments by which they overturned the papal pretensions to
supremacy in this country. In a note on [Mat
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#009.md), in a Bible published by Edmund
Becke in 1549, the 2nd of Edward VI., we find the following words: -
Call no man your father upon the earth. Here is the Bishoppe of Rome
declared a plaine Antichrist, in that he woulde be called the most holye
father; and that all Christen men shoulde acknowledge hym for no lesse
then their spyritual father, notwithstandinge these playne wordes of
Christe. It is true, nothing can be plainer; and yet, in the face of
these commands, the pope has claimed the honor; and millions of men have
been so stupid as to concede it. May those days of darkness, tyranny,
and disgrace, never return!

From the 13th to the 39th verse, our Lord pronounces eight woes, or
rather pathetic declarations, against the scribes and Pharisees.

1\. For their unwillingness to let the common people enjoy the pure word
of God, or its right explanation: Ye shut up the kingdom, etc., [Mat
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#013.md).

2\. For their rapacity, and pretended sanctity in order to secure their
secular ends: Ye devour widows houses, etc., [Mat
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#014.md).

3\. For their pretended zeal to spread the kingdom of God by making
proselytes, when they had no other end in view than forming instruments
for the purposes of their oppression and cruelty: Ye compass sea and
land, etc., [Mat 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#015.md).

4\. For their bad doctrine and false interpretations of the Scriptures,
and their dispensing with the most solemn oaths and vows at pleasure: Ye
blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is
nothing, etc., [Mat 23:16-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#016.md).

5\. For their superstition in scrupulously attending to little things,
and things not commanded, and omitting matters of great importance, the
practice of which God had especially enjoined: Ye pay tithe of mint and
cummin, etc., [Mat 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023.md), [Mat
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#024.md).

6\. For their hypocrisy, pretended saintship, and endeavoring to
maintain decency in their outward conduct, while they had no other
object in view than to deceive the people, and make them acquiesce in
their oppressive measures: Ye make clean the outside of the cup, [Mat
23:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#025.md), [Mat
23:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#026.md).

7\. For the depth of their inward depravity and abomination, having
nothing good, fair, or supportable, but the mere outside. - Most
hypocrites and wicked men have some good: but these were radically and
totally evil: Ye are like unto whited sepulchres - within full - of all
uncleanness, [Mat 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#027.md), [Mat
23:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#028.md).

8\. For their pretended concern for the holiness of the people, which
proceeded no farther than to keep them free from such pollutions as they
might accidentally and innocently contract, by casually stepping on the
place where a person had been buried: and for their affected regret that
their fathers had killed the prophets, while themselves possessed and
cultivated the same murderous inclinations: Ye - garnish the sepulchres
of the righteous, and say, If we had been, etc., [Mat
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#029.md), [Mat
23:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#030.md).

It is amazing with what power and authority our blessed Lord reproves
this bad people. This was the last discourse they ever heard from him;
and it is surprising, considering their wickedness, that they waited
even for a mock trial, and did not rise up at once and destroy him. But
the time was not yet come in which he was to lay down his life, for no
man could take it from him.

While he appears in this last discourse with all the authority of a
lawgiver and judge, he at the same time shows the tenderness and
compassion of a friend and a father: he beholds their awful state - his
eye affects his heart, and he weeps over them! Were not the present
hardness and final perdition of these ungodly men entirely of
themselves? Could Jesus, as the Supreme God, have fixed their
reprobation from all eternity by any necessitating decree; and yet weep
over the unavoidable consequences of his own sovereign determinations?
How absurd as well as shocking is the thought! This is Jewish exclusion:
Credat Judaeus Apella-non ego.
