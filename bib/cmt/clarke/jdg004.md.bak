### [Judges Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#001.md)

[Judges](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jdg 4:0</span></span>

The Israelites again rebel against God, and they are delivered into the
hands of Jabin, king of Canaan, [Jdg
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#001.md), [Jdg
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#002.md). They cry unto God, and he raises
up Deborah and Barak to deliver then, [Jdg
4:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#003.md). Some account of Heber the
Kenite, [Jdg 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#011.md). Barak attacks
Sisera, captain of Jabin's army, at the river Kishon, and gives him a
total overthrow, [Jdg 4:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#012.md). Sisera
leaves his chariot, and flies away on foot; enters the tent of Jael, the
wife of Heber, by whom he is slain, while secreting himself in her
apartment, [Jdg 4:17-24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#017.md).

[Judges 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 4:1</span></span>

When Ehud was dead - Why not when Shamgar was dead? Does this not
intimate that Shamgar was not reckoned in the number of the judges?

[Judges 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 4:2</span></span>

Jabin king of Canaan - Probably a descendant of the Jabin mentioned [Jos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#001.md), etc., who had gathered together
the wrecks of the army of that Jabin defeated by Joshua. Calmet supposes
that these Canaanites had the dominion over the tribes of Naphtali,
Zebulun, and Issachar; while Deborah judged in Ephraim, and Shamgar in
Judah.

[Judges 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 4:3</span></span>

Nine hundred chariots of iron - Chariots armed with iron scythes, as is
generally supposed; they could not have been made all of iron, but they
might have been shod with iron, or had iron scythes projecting from the
axle on each side, by which infantry might be easily cut down or thrown
into confusion. The ancient Britons are said to have had such chariots.

[Judges 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 4:4</span></span>

Deborah, a prophetess - One on whom the Spirit of God descended, and who
was the instrument of conveying to the Israelites the knowledge of the
Divine will, in things sacred and civil.

She judged Israel - This is, I believe, the first instance of
gynaecocrasy, or female government, on record. Deborah seems to have
been supreme both in civil and religious affairs; and Lapidoth, her
husband, appears to have had no hand in the government. But the original
may as well be translated a woman of Lapidoth, as the wife of Lapidoth.

[Judges 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jdg 4:5</span></span>

The palm tree of Deborah - It is common for the Hindoos to plant trees
in the names of themselves and their friends; and some religious
mendicants live for a considerable time under trees. - Ward.

[Judges 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 4:6</span></span>

She sent and called Barak - She appointed him to be general of the
armies on this occasion; which shows that she possessed the supreme
power in the state.

Mount Tabor - "Mount Tabor," says Maundrell, "stands by itself, about
two or three furlongs within the plains of Esdraelon. It has a plain
area at the top, both fertile and delicious of an oval figure, extending
about one furlong in breadth, and two in length. The prospect from the
top is beautiful: on the N.W. is the Mediterranean; and all around you
have the spacious plains of Esdraelon and Galilee, which present you
with a view of many places famous for the resort and miracles of the Son
of God. At the bottom of Tabor, westward, stands Daberah, a small
village, supposed to have taken its name from Deborah. Near this valley
is the brook Kishon. During the rainy season, all the water that falls
on the eastern side of the mountain, or upon the rising ground to the
southward, empties itself into it, in a number of torrents: at which
conjuncture it overflows its banks, acquires a wonderful rapidity, and
carries all before it. It might be at such a time as this when the stars
are said to fight against Sisera, [Jdg
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#020.md), [Jdg
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#021.md), by bringing an abundance of
rain, whereby the Kishon became so high and rapid as to sweep away the
host of Sisera, in attempting to ford it." See Maundrell and Shaw. This
mountain is very difficult of ascent; it took Mr. Maundrell nearly an
hour to reach the top; this, with its grand area on the summit, made a
very proper place for the rendezvous of Barak's army. Antiochus used it
for the same purpose in his wars; and Josephus appears to have fortified
it; and Placidus, one of Vespasian's generals, was sent to reduce it.
See more in Calmet.

[Judges 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jdg 4:9</span></span>

The Lord shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman - Does not this
mean, If I go with thee, the conquest shall be attributed to me, and
thou wilt have no honor? Or, is it a prediction of the exploit of Jael?
In both these senses the words have been understood. It seems, however,
more likely that Jael is intended. The Septuagint made a remarkable
addition to the speech of Barak: "If thou wilt go with me I will go; but
if thou wilt not go with me, I will not go; Ὁτι ουκ οιδα την ἡμεραν εν ῃ
ευοδοι Κυριος τον αγγελον μετ' εμου, because I know not the day in which
the Lord will send his angel to give me success." By which he appears to
mean, that although he was certain of a Divine call to this work, yet,
as he knew not the time in which it would be proper for him to make the
attack, he wishes that Deborah, on whom the Divine Spirit constantly
rested, would accompany him to let him know when to strike that blow,
which he knew would be decisive. This was quite natural, and quite
reasonable, and is no impeachment whatever of Barak's faith. St. Ambrose
and St. Augustine have the same reading; but it is found in no MS. nor
in any other of the versions. See [Jdg
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#014.md).

[Judges 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jdg 4:10</span></span>

Ten thousand men at his feet - Ten thousand footmen. He had no chariots;
his army was all composed of infantry.

[Judges 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 4:11</span></span>

Hohab the father-in-law of Moses - For a circumstantial account of this
person, and the meaning of the original word חתן chothen, which is
translated son-in-law in [Gen 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#014.md),
see the notes on [Exo 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#015.md), [Exo
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#016.md), [Exo
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#018.md); [Exo
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#001.md); [Exo
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#020.md), [Exo
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#024.md); [Exo
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#005.md).

[Judges 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jdg 4:14</span></span>

Up; for this is the day - This is exactly the purpose for which the
Septuagint state, [Jdg 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#008.md), that Barak
wished Deborah to accompany him. "I know not," says he, "The Day in
which God will send his angel to give me prosperity: come thou with we
that thou mayest direct me in this respect." She went, and told him the
precise time in which he was to make the attack: Up, for This is the Day
in which the Lord hath delivered Sisera into thine hand.

Went down from Mount Tabor - He had probably encamped his men on and
near the summit of this mount. See the note on [Jdg
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#006.md).

[Judges 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jdg 4:15</span></span>

The Lord discomfited Sisera - ויהם יהוה vayiahom Jehovah; the Lord
Confounded, threw them all into confusion, drove them pell-mell - caused
chariots to break and overthrow chariots, and threw universal disorder
into all their ranks. In this case Barak and his men had little to do
but kill and pursue, and Sisera in order to escape, was obliged to
abandon his chariot. There is no doubt all this was done by supernatural
agency; God sent his angel and confounded them.

[Judges 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jdg 4:18</span></span>

Jael went out to meet Sisera - He preferred the woman's tent because of
secrecy; for, according to the etiquette of the eastern countries, no
person ever intrudes into the apartments of the women. And in every
dwelling the women have a separate apartment.

[Judges 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jdg 4:19</span></span>

She opened a bottle of milk - She gave more than he requested; and her
friendship increased his confidence and security.

[Judges 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jdg 4:20</span></span>

Stand in the door of the tent - As no man would intrude into the women's
apartment without permission, her simply saying, there is no man in my
tent, would preclude all search.

[Judges 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jdg 4:21</span></span>

A nail of the tent - One of the spikes by which they fasten to the
ground the cords which are attached to the cloth or covering.

He was fast asleep and weary - As he lay on one side, and was
overwhelmed with sleep through the heat and fatigues of the day, the
piercing of his temples must have in a moment put him past resistance.

[Judges 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jdg 4:22</span></span>

Behold, Sisera lay dead - What impression this made on the victorious
Barak is not said: it could not give him much pleasure, especially when
he learned the circumstances of his death.

[Judges 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jdg 4:24</span></span>

The hand of the children of Israel prospered - ותלך הלוך vattelech
haloch, it went, going - they followed up this victory, and the
consequence was, they utterly destroyed Jabin and his kingdom. It will
naturally be expected that something should be said to justify the
conduct of Jael: it must be owned that she slew Sisera in circumstances
which caused the whole transaction to appear exceedingly questionable.
They are the following: -

1\. There was peace between her family and the king of Canaan.

2\. That peace was no doubt made, as all transactions of the kind were,
with a sacrifice and an oath.

3\. Sisera, knowing this, came to her tent with the utmost confidence.

4\. She met him with the most friendly greetings and assurances of
safety.

5\. Having asked for water, to show her friendship and respect she gave
him cream, and that in a vessel suitable to his dignity.

6\. She put him in the secret part of her own tent, and covered him in
such a way as to evidence her good faith, and to inspire him with the
greater confidence.

7\. She agreed to keep watch at the door, and deny his being there to
any that might inquire.

8\. As she gave him permission to secrete himself with her, and gave him
refreshment, she was bound by the rules of Asiatic hospitality to have
defended his life, even at the risk of her own.

9\. Notwithstanding, she took the advantage of his weariness and deep
sleep, and took away his life!

10\. She exulted in her deed, met Barak, and showed him in triumph what
she had done.

Now do we not find, in all this, bad faith, deceit, deep hypocrisy,
lying, breach of treaty, contempt of religious rites, breach of the laws
of hospitality, deliberate and unprovoked murder? But what can be said
in her justification? All that can be said, and all that has been said
is simply this: "She might have been sincere at first, but was
afterwards Divinely directed to do what she did." If this was so, she is
sufficiently vindicated by the fact; for God has a right to dispose of
the lives of his creatures as he pleases: and probably the cup of
Sisera's iniquity was full, and his life already forfeited to the
justice of God. But does it appear that she received any such direction
from God? There is no sufficient evidence of it: it is true that
Deborah, a prophetess, declares her blessed above women; and this seems
to intimate that her conduct was pleasing to God. If Deborah was
inspired on this occasion, her words are a presumptive proof that the
act was right; unless we are to understand it as a simple declaration of
the reputation she should be held in among her own sex. But we do not
find one word from Jael herself, stating how she was led to do an act
repugnant to her feelings as a woman, contrary to good faith, and a
breach of the rules of hospitality. Nor does the sacred penman say one
word to explain the case; as in the case of Ehud, he states the fact,
and leaves his readers to form their own opinion. To say, as has been
said in the case of Eglon, that "Sisera was a public enemy, and any of
the people whom he oppressed might be justified in taking away his
life," is a very dangerous position, as it refers one of the most solemn
acts of judgment and justice to the caprice, or prejudice, or
enthusiastic feeling of every individual who may persuade himself that
he is not only concerned in the business, but authorized by God to take
vengeance by his own hand. While justice and law are in the world, God
never will, as he never did, abandon cases of this kind to the caprice,
prejudice, or party feeling, of any man. The conduct of Ehud and Jael
are before the tribunal of God: I will not justify, I dare not
absolutely condemn; there I leave them, and entreat my readers to do the
like; after referring them to the observations at the end of the
preceding chapter, where the subject is considered more at large.
