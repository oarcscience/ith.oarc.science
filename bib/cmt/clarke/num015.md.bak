### [Numbers Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 15:0</span></span>

Directions concerning the different offerings they should bring unto the
Lord when they should come to the land of Canaan, [Num
15:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#001.md). Directions relative to the
meat-offering, [Num 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#004.md); to the
drink-offering, [Num 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#005.md). Of the
burnt-offering, vow-offering, peace-offering, drink-offering, etc., [Num
15:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#006.md). All born in the country must
perform these rites, [Num 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#013.md), and
the strangers also, [Num 15:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#014.md).
They shall offer unto the Lord a heave-offering of the first-fruits of
the land, [Num 15:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#017.md). Concerning
omissions through ignorance, and the sacrifices to be offered on such
occasions, [Num 15:22-29](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#022.md). He who sins
presumptuously shall be cut off, [Num
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#030.md), [Num
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#031.md). History of the person who
gathered sticks on the Sabbath, [Num
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#032.md). He is brought to Moses and
Aaron, [Num 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#033.md). They put him in
confinement till the mind of the Lord should be known on the case, [Num
15:34](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#034.md). The Lord commands him to be
stoned, [Num 15:35](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#035.md). He is stoned to
death, [Num 15:36](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#036.md). The Israelites are
commanded to make fringes to the borders of their garments, [Num
15:37](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#037.md), [Num
15:38](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#038.md). The end for which these fringes
were to be made, that they might remember the commandments of the Lord,
that they might be holy, [Num
15:39-41](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#039.md).

[Numbers 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 15:2</span></span>

When ye be come into the land - Some learned men are of opinion that
several offerings prescribed by the law were not intended to be made in
the wilderness, but in the promised land; the former not affording those
conveniences which were necessary to the complete observance of the
Divine worship in this and several other respects.

[Numbers 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 15:3</span></span>

And will make an offering - For the different kinds of offerings,
sacrifices, etc., see [Lev 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#002.md), [Lev
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#007.md).

[Numbers 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 15:5</span></span>

The fourth part of a hin - The quantity of meal and flour was augmented
in proportion to the size of the sacrifice with which it was offered.
With a Lamb or a Kid were offered one tenth deal of flour, (the tenth
part of an ephah, see on [Exo 29:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#040.md)
(note)), the fourth part of a hin of oil, and the fourth part of a hin
of wine. With a Ram, two tenth deals of flour, a third part of a hin of
oil, and a third part of a hin of wine. With a Bullock, three tenth
deals of flour, half a hin of oil, and half a hin of wine. See [Num
15:4-11](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#004.md).

[Numbers 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">num 15:14</span></span>

If a stranger sojourn - See the notes on [Lev
19:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#033.md);[Lev
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#009.md). When the case of the Jewish
people is fairly considered, and their situation with respect to the
surrounding idolatrous nations, we shall see the absolute necessity of
having but one form of worship in the land. That alone was genuine which
was prescribed by the Almighty, and no others could be tolerated,
because they were idolatrous. All strangers - all that came to sojourn
in the land, were required to conform to it; and it was right that those
who did conform to it should have equal rights and privileges with the
Hebrews themselves, which we find was the case. But under the Christian
dispensation, as no particular form of worship is prescribed, the types
and ceremonies of the Mosaic institution being all fulfilled, unlimited
toleration should be allowed; and while the sacred writings are made the
basis of the worship offered to God, every man should be allowed to
worship according to his own conscience, for in this respect every one
is

"Lord of himself, accountable to none

But to his conscience and his God alone."

[Numbers 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 15:20</span></span>

Ye shall offer - the first of your dough - Concerning the offerings of
first-fruits, see the notes on [Exo
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#029.md).

[Numbers 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">num 15:24</span></span>

If aught be committed by ignorance - See the notes on [Lev
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#002.md), and [Lev
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#017.md). The case here probably refers to
the whole congregation; the cases above, to the sin of an individual.

[Numbers 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">num 15:25</span></span>

The priest shall make an atonement - Even sins committed through
ignorance required an atonement; and God in his mercy has provided one
for them.

[Numbers 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">num 15:30</span></span>

But the soul that doeth aught presumptuously - Bold daring acts of
transgression against the fullest evidence, and in despite of the Divine
authority, admitted of no atonement; the person was to be cut off - to
be excluded from God's people, and from all their privileges and
blessings.

Probably the presumption mentioned here implied an utter contempt of the
word and authority of God, springing from an idolatrous or atheistical
mind. In such a case all repentance was precluded, because of the denial
of the word and being of God. It is probably a case similar to that
mentioned [Heb 6:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004) (note.md); [Heb
10:26-31](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#026) (note.md); on which passages see
the notes.

[Numbers 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">num 15:32</span></span>

They found a man that gathered sticks upon the Sabbath - This was in all
likelihood a case of that kind supposed above: the man despised the word
of the Lord, and therefore broke his commandment; see [Num
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#031.md). On this ground he was punished
with the utmost rigor of the law.

[Numbers 15:36](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">num 15:36</span></span>

Stoned him - See the note on [Lev
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#023.md).

[Numbers 15:38](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">num 15:38</span></span>

Bid them - make them fringes - We learn from [Num
15:39](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#039.md) that these fringes were
emblematical of the various commands of God. That there was any analogy
between a fringe and a precept, it would be bold to assert; but when a
thing is appointed to represent another, no matter how different, that
first object be comes the regular representative or sign of the other.
There is no analogy between the term bread and the farinaceous nutritive
substance thereby signified; but because this term is used to express
and represent that thing, every person thus understands it; and when the
word bread is seen or heard, a perfect knowledge, not of the letters
which compose that word, but of the thing signified by it, is conveyed
to the mind. So the fringes, being appointed by God to represent and
bring to mind the commandments of God, [Num
15:39](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#039.md), the mention or sight of them
conveyed the intelligence intended. All the Jews wore these, and so
probably did our Lord; see [Mat 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#020.md),
where the word κρασπε ον is rather to be understood of the fringe than
of the hem of his garment.
