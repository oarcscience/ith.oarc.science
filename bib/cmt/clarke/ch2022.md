### [2 Chronicles Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 22:0</span></span>

Ahaziah beans to reign; and reigns wickedly under the counsels of his
bad mother, [Ch2 22:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#001.md). He is slain
by Jehu, who destroys all the house of Ahab, [Ch2
22:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#005.md). Athaliah destroys all the seed
royal of Judah, except Joash, who is hidden by his nurse in the temple
six years, [Ch2 22:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#010.md).

[2 Chronicles 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 22:1</span></span>

Made Ahaziah his youngest son king - All the others had been slain by
the Arabians, etc.; see the preceding chapter, [Ch2
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#017) (note.md).

[2 Chronicles 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 22:2</span></span>

Forty and two years old was Ahaziah - See the note on [Kg2
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#026.md). Ahaziah might have been
twenty-two years old, according to [Kg2
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#026) (note.md), but he could not have
been forty-two, as stated here, without being two years older than his
own father! See the note there. The Syriac and Arabic have twenty-two,
and the Septuagint, in some copies, twenty. And it is very probable that
the Hebrew text read so originally; for when numbers were expressed by
single letters, it was easy to mistake מ mem, Forty, for כ caph, Twenty.
And if this book was written by a scribe who used the ancient Hebrew
letters, now called the Samaritan, the mistake was still more easy and
probable, as the difference between caph and mem is very small, and can
in many instances be discerned only by an accustomed eye.

The reading in [Kg2 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#026.md) is right, and
any attempt to reconcile this in Chronicles with that is equally futile
and absurd. Both readings cannot be true; is that therefore likely to be
genuine that makes the son two years older than the father who begat
him? Apage hae nugae!

[2 Chronicles 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 22:3</span></span>

His mother was his counsellor - Athaliah, the wicked daughter of a
wicked parent, and the wicked spouse of an unprincipled king.

[2 Chronicles 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 22:5</span></span>

Went with Jehoram - See on [Kg2 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#028.md)
(note).

[2 Chronicles 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 22:9</span></span>

He sought Ahaziah - See a different account [Kg2
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#027) (note.md), and the note there, where
the accounts are reconciled.

[2 Chronicles 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 22:10</span></span>

All the seed royal of the house of Judah - Nothing but the miraculous
intervention of the Divine providence could have saved the line of David
at this time, and preserved the prophecy relative to the Messiah. The
whole truth of that prophecy, and the salvation of the world, appeared
to be now suspended on the brittle thread of the life of an infant of a
year old, (see [Ch2 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#001).md), to destroy
whom was the interest of the reigning power! But God can save by few as
well as by many. He had purposed, and vain were the counter-exertions of
earth and hell.

[2 Chronicles 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 22:12</span></span>

Hid in the house of God - "In the house of the sanctuary of God." -
Targum. Or, as he says on [Ch2 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#011.md),
בקודש קודשיא bekudash kudeshaiya "in the holy of holies." To this place
Athaliah had no access, therefore Joash lay concealed, he and his
affectionate aunt-nurse. - See on [Kg2
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#001) (note.md).
