### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ecc 10:0</span></span>

Observations on wisdom and folly, [Ecc
10:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#001.md). Concerning right conduct
towards rulers, [Ecc 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#004.md). Merit
depressed, and worthlessness exalted, [Ecc
10:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#005.md). Of him who digs a pit and
removes a landmark, [Ecc 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#008.md), [Ecc
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#009.md). The use of wisdom and
experience, [Ecc 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#010.md). Of the babbler
and the fool, [Ecc 10:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#011.md). The
infant king, [Ecc 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#016.md). The
well-regulated court, [Ecc 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#017.md). Of
slothfulness, [Ecc 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#018.md). Of feasting,
[Ecc 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#019.md). Speak not evil of the
king, [Ecc 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#020.md).

[Ecclesiastes 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 10:1</span></span>

Dead flies - Any putrefaction spoils perfume; and so a foolish act ruins
the character of him who has the reputation of being wise and good.
Alas! alas! in an unguarded moment how many have tarnished the
reputation which they were many years in acquiring! Hence, no man can be
said to be safe, till he is taken to the paradise of God.

[Ecclesiastes 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 10:2</span></span>

A wise man's heart is at his right hand - As the right hand is
ordinarily the best exercised, strongest, and most ready, and the left
the contrary, they show,

1\. The command which the wise man has over his own mind, feelings,
passions, etc., and the prudence with which he acts. And,

2\. The want of prudence and management in the fool, who has no
restraint on his passions, and no rule or guard upon his tongue. The
right hand and the left are used in Scripture to express good and evil.
The wise man is always employed in doing good; the fool, in nonsense or
evil.

[Ecclesiastes 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 10:3</span></span>

When - a fool walketh by the way - In every act of life, and in every
company he frequents, the irreligious man shows what he is. Vanity,
nonsense, and wickedness are his themes: so that in effect he saith to
every one that he is a fool.

[Ecclesiastes 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 10:4</span></span>

If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee - If the king get
incensed against thee.

Leave not thy place - Humble thyself before him, that is thy place and
duty; for yielding to him, and not standing stoutly in thy defense,
pacifieth great offenses: and then, when his anger is appeased, he will
hear any thing in thy justification, if thou have any thing to offer.
This is good advice to a child in reference to his parents, and to an
inferior of any kind in reference to his superiors.

Several of the fathers understood this differently, It the spirit of the
ruler - the influence of Satan - hath risen up against and prevailed
over thee, to bring thee into some sin; leave not thy place - do not
despair of God's mercy; humble thyself before him, and seek pardon
through the Son of his love, and this will be מרפא marpe, a remedy or
cure even for חטאים גדולים chataim gedolim, great errors or sins. All
this is true in itself, whether found in this text or not.

[Ecclesiastes 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 10:5</span></span>

An error which proceedeth from the ruler - What this error in the ruler
is, the two following verses point out: it is simpiy this - an
injudicious distribution of offices, and raising people to places of
trust and confidence, who are destitute of merit, are neither of name
nor family to excite public confidence, and are without property; so
that they have no stake in the country, and their only solicitude must
naturally be to enrich themselves, and provide for their poor relatives.
This is frequent in the governments of the world; and favouritism has
often brought prosperous nations to the brink of ruin. Folly was set in
dignity; the man of property, sense, and name, in a low place. Servants
- menial men, rode upon horses - carried every thing with a high and
proud hand; and princes, - the nobles of the people, were obliged to
walk by their sides, and often from the state of things to become in
effect their servants. This was often the case in this country, during
the reign of Thomas a Becket, and Cardinal Woolsey. These insolent men
lorded it over the whole nation; and the people and their gentry were
raised or depressed according as their pride and caprice willed. And,
through this kind of errors, not only a few sovereigns have had most
uncomfortable and troublesome reigns, but some have even lost their
lives.

[Ecclesiastes 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 10:8</span></span>

Whoso breaketh a hedge, a serpent shall bite him - While spoiling his
neighbor's property, he himself may come to greater mischief: while
pulling out the sticks, he may be bit by a serpent, who has his nest
there. Some have supposed that נחש nachash here means a thorn; perhaps
from the similarity of its prick to the serpent's sting. He who forces
his way through a hedge will be pricked by the thorns.

[Ecclesiastes 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 10:9</span></span>

Whoso removeth stones - This verse teaches care and caution. Whoever
pulls down an old building is likely to be hurt by the stones; and in
cleaving wood many accidents occur for want of sufficient caution.

[Ecclesiastes 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 10:10</span></span>

If the iron be blunt - If the axe have lost its edge, and the owner do
not sharpen it, he must apply the more strength to make it cut: but the
wisdom that is profitable to direct will teach him, that he should whet
his axe, and spare his strength. Thus, without wisdom and understanding
we cannot go profitably through the meanest concerns in life.

[Ecclesiastes 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 10:11</span></span>

The serpent will bite without enchantment - בלא לחש belo lachash,
without hissing. As a snake may bite before it hiss, so also will the
babbler, talkative person, or calumniator. Without directly speaking
evil, he insinuates, by innuendoes, things injurious to the reputation
of his neighbor. Gif the eddir bite in silence, noyhing lasse than he
hath that privily backbiteth - Old MS. Bible. "A babbler of his tongue
is no better than a serpent that styngeth without hyssynge." -
Coverdale. The moral of this saying is simply this: A calumniator is as
dangerous as a poisonous serpent; and from the envenomed tongue of
slander and detraction no man is safe. The comparing the serpent, נחש
nachash, to a babbler, has something singular in it. I have already
supposed that the creature mentioned, [Gen
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#001.md), was of the genus simia. This has
been ridiculed, but not disproved.

[Ecclesiastes 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 10:12</span></span>

The words of a wise man's mouth - Every thing that proceeds from him is
decent and orderly, creditable to himself, and acceptable to those who
hear him. But the lips of the fool, which speak every thing at random,
and have no understanding to guide them, are not only not pleasant to
others, but often destructive to himself.

[Ecclesiastes 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ecc 10:14</span></span>

A man cannot tell what shall be - A foolish babbling man will talk on
every subject, though he can say as little on the past, as he can on the
future.

[Ecclesiastes 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ecc 10:15</span></span>

He knoweth not how to go to the city - I suppose this to be a proverb:
"He knows nothing; he does not know his way to the next village." He may
labor; but for want of judgment he wearies himself to no purpose.

[Ecclesiastes 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ecc 10:16</span></span>

Wo to thee, O land, when thy king is a child - Minorities are, in
general, very prejudicial to a state. Regents either disagree, and
foment civil wars; or oppress the people. Various discordant interests
are raised up in a state during a minority; and the young king, having
been under the tutelage of interested men, acts partially and
injuriously to the interests of the people when he comes to the throne;
and this produces popular discontent, and a troubled reign.

Thy princes eat in the morning! - They do nothing in order; turn night
into day, and day into night; sleep when they should wake, and wake when
they should sleep; attending more to chamberings and banquetings, than
to the concerns of the state.

[Ecclesiastes 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ecc 10:17</span></span>

When thy king is the son of nobles - uiov eleuyerwn, the son of freemen;
persons well acquainted with the principles of civil liberty, and who
rule according to them - Septuagint. Such a one as comes to the throne
in a legitimate way, from an ancient regal family, whose right to the
throne is incontestable. It requires such a long time to establish a
regal right, that the state is in continual danger from pretenders and
usurpers, where the king is not the son of nobles.

And thy princes eat in due season - All persons in places of trust for
the public weal, from the king to the lowest public functionary, should
know, that the public are exceedingly scandalized at repeated accounts
of entertainments, where irregularity prevails, much money is expended,
and no good done. These things are drawn into precedent, and quoted to
countenance debauch in the inferior classes. The natural division of the
day for necessary repasts is, Breakfast, eight, or half after; Dinner,
one, or half after; Supper, eight, or half after. And these, or even
earliers hours were formerly observed in these countries. Then we had
scarcely any such thing as gout, and no nervous disorders.

In ancient nations the custom was to eat but once, and then about
mid-day.

[Ecclesiastes 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ecc 10:18</span></span>

By much slothfulness - This is remarkably the case in some countries.
Houses are not repaired till they almost fall about the ears of the
inhabitants. We have an adage that applies to all such cases: "A stitch
in time saves nine."

[Ecclesiastes 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ecc 10:19</span></span>

A feast is made for laughter - The object of it is to produce merriment,
to banish care and concern of every kind. But who are they who make and
frequent such places? Epicures and drunkards generally; such as those of
whom Horace speaks:

Nos numerus sumus, et fruges consumere nati.

Epist. lib. i., ep. 2, ver. 27.

"Those whose names stand as indications of men, the useless many; and
who appear to be born only to consume the produce of the soil."

But money answereth all - This saying has prevailed everywhere.

Scilicet uxorem cum dote, fidemque, et amicos,

Et genus, et formam Regina Pecunia donat;

Ac bene nummatum decorat Suadela, Venusque.

Hor. Ep. lib. i., ep. 6, ver. 36.

"For gold, the sovereign Queen of all below,

Friends, honor, birth, and beauty, can bestow.

The goddess of persuasion forms her train;

And Venus decks the well-bemonied swain."

Francis.

[Ecclesiastes 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ecc 10:20</span></span>

Curse not the king - Do not permit thyself even to think evil of the
king; lest thy tongue at some time give vent to thy thoughts, and so
thou be chargeable with treason.

For a bird of the air shall carry the voice - Does he refer here to such
fowls as the carrier pigeon, which were often used to carry letters
under their wings to a great distance, and bring back answers? The
Targum turns it curiously: "Do not speak evil of the king in thy
conscience, nor in the secret of thy heart, nor in the most hidden place
in thy house, curse not a wise man; for Raziel calls daily from heaven
upon Mount Horeb, and his voice goes through the whole world; and
Elijah, the great priest, goes, flying through the air like a winged
eagle, and publishes the words which are spoken in secret by all the
inhabitants of the earth."

Civil government is so peculiarly of God, that he will have it supported
for the benefit of mankind; and those who attempt to disturb it are
generally marked by his strong disapprobation. And though there have
been multitudes of treasons hatched in the deepest secrecy; yet, through
the providence of God, they have been discovered in the most singular
manner. This shows God's care for government.
