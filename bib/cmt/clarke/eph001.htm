<p>The apostle's salutation to the Church, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#001">Eph 1:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#002">Eph 1:2</A>. He blesses God for calling the Gentiles to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ, by whose sacrificial death both they and the Jews find redemption, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003">Eph 1:3-7</A>. He shows that it was through the great abundance of God's wisdom and goodness that the Gentiles were called into a state of salvation, and that they should receive the Holy Spirit as the earnest of their inheritance, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#008">Eph 1:8-15</A>. He praises God for their conversion, and prays that they may be farther enlightened, that they may see the glory of Christ, and partake of the blessings procured by his passion and exaltation, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#016">Eph 1:16-23</A>.

<p>To the saints which are at Ephesus - As some learned men think that this epistle was written to the Church of the Laodiceans, and that the words &#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x395;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#837;, in Ephesus, were not originally in this epistle, the consideration of the subject has appeared to be more proper for the preface; and to that the reader is referred for a particular discussion of this opinion. By the term saints we are to understand those who in that place professed Christianity, and were members of the Christian Church. Saint properly signifies a holy person, and such the Gospel of Christ requires every man to be, and such every true believer is, both in heart and life; but saint appears to have been as ordinary a denomination of a believer in Christ in those primitive times, as the term Christian is now. Yet many had the name who had not the thing.
<p>The faithful in Christ Jesus - &#x3a0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#903; the believers - the persons who received Christ as the promised Messiah, and the Savior of the world, and continued in the grace which they had received.

<p>Blessed be the God - See the note on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#003">Co2 1:3</A>, where the same form is used.
<p>With all spiritual blessings - With the pure doctrines of the Gospel, and the abundant gifts and graces of the Holy Ghost, justifying, sanctifying, and building us up on our most holy faith.
<p>In heavenly places - &#x395;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#903; In heavenly things, such as those mentioned above; they were not yet in heavenly places, but they had abundance of heavenly things to prepare them for heavenly places. Some think the word should be understood as signifying blessings of the most exalted or excellent kind, such as are spiritual in opposition to those that are earthly, such as are eternal in opposition to those that are temporal; and all these in, through and by Christ. We have already seen, on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#026">Gal 4:26</A>, that the heavenly Jerusalem, or Jerusalem which is from above, is used by the Jews to signify the days of the Messiah, and that state of grace and glory which should follow the Levitical worship and ceremonies; and it is possible that St. Paul may use the word &#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, heavenly things, in this sense: God hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly things, or in this heavenly state, in which life and immortality are brought to light by the Gospel. This is apparently the preferable sense. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004">Ephesians 1:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">eph 1:4</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>According as he hath chosen us in him - As he has decreed from the beginning of the world, and has kept in view from the commencement of the religious system of the Jews, (which the phrase sometimes means), to bring us Gentiles to the knowledge of this glorious state of salvation by Christ Jesus. The Jews considered themselves an elect or chosen people, and wished to monopolize the whole of the Divine love and beneficence. The apostle here shows that God had the Gentiles as much in the contemplation of his mercy and goodness as he had the Jews; and the blessings of the Gospel, now so freely dispensed to them, were the proof that God had thus chosen them, and that his end in giving them the Gospel was the same which he had in view by giving the law to the Jews, viz. that they might be holy and without blame before him. And as his object was the same in respect to them both, they should consider that, as he loved them, so they should love one another: God having provided for each the same blessings, they should therefore be &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;, holy - fully separated from earth and sin, and consecrated to God and &#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;, without blame - having no spot nor imperfection, their inward holiness agreeing with their outward consecration. The words are a metaphor taken from the perfect and immaculate sacrifices which the law required the people to bring to the altar of God. But as love is the fulfilling of the law, and love the fountain whence their salvation flowed, therefore love must fill their hearts towards God and each other, and love must be the motive and end of all their words and works. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#005">Ephesians 1:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">eph 1:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Having predestinated us - &#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;. As the doctrine of eternal predestination has produced much controversy in the Christian world, it may be necessary to examine the meaning of the term, that those who do use it may employ it according to the sense it has in the oracles of God. The verb &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;, from &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;, before, and &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;, I define, finish, bound, or terminate, whence &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, a boundary or limit, signifies to define beforehand, and circumscribe by certain bounds or limits; and is originally a geographical term, but applied also to any thing concluded, or determined, or demonstrated. Here the word is used to point out God's fixed purpose or predetermination to bestow on the Gentiles the blessing of the adoption of sons by Jesus Christ, which adoption had been before granted to the Jewish people; and without circumcision, or any other Mosaic rite, to admit the Gentiles to all the privileges of his Church and people. And the apostle marks that all this was fore-determined by God, as he had fore-determined the bounds and precincts of the land which he gave them according to the promise made to their fathers; that the Jews had no reason to complain, for God had formed this purpose before he had given the law, or called them out of Egypt; (for it was before the foundation of the world, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004">Eph 1:4</A>); and that, therefore, the conduct of God in calling the Gentiles now - bringing them into his Church, and conferring on them the gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit, was in pursuance of his original design; and, if he did not do so, his eternal purposes could not be fulfilled; and that, as the Jews were taken to be his peculiar people, not because they had any goodness or merit in themselves; so the Gentiles were called, not for any merit they had, but according to the good pleasure of his will; that is, according to his eternal benevolence, showing mercy and conferring privileges in this new creation, as he had done in the original creation; for as, in creating man, he drew every consideration from his own innate eternal benevolence, so now, in redeeming man, and sending the glad tidings of salvation both to the Jews and the Gentiles, be acted on the same principles, deriving all the reasons of his conduct from his own infinite goodness.
<p>This argument was exceedingly conclusive, and must silence the Jews on the ground of their original, primitive, and exclusive rights, which they were ever ready to plead against all pretensions of the Gentiles. If therefore God, before the foundation of the Jewish economy, had determined that the Gentiles, in the fullness of time, should be called to and admitted into all the privileges of the Messiah's kingdom, then the exclusive salvation of the Jews was chimerical; and what God was doing now, by the preaching of the apostles in the Gentile world, was in pursuance of his original design. This same argument St. Paul repeatedly produces in his Epistle to the Romans; and a proper consideration of it unlocks many difficulties in that epistle. See the notes on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029">Rom 8:29</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030">Rom 8:30</A> (note); and elsewhere, in the course of that epistle, where this subject is handled. But why is the word &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, fore-determined, limited, or circumscribed, used here? Merely in reference to the settlement of the Israelites in the promised land. God assigned to them the portions which they were to inherit; and these portions were described, and their bearings, boundaries, vicinities to other portions, extent and length, as exactly ascertained as they could be by the most correct geographical map. As God, therefore, had dealt with the Jews in making them his peculiar people, and when he divided the earth among the sons of Noah reserved to himself the twelve portions which he afterwards gave to the twelve tribes; (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#008">Deu 32:8</A> (note)); and as his dealings with them were typical of what he intended to do in the calling and salvation of the Gentiles; so he uses the terms by which their allotment and settlement were pointed out to show that, what he had thus designed and typified, he had now fulfilled according to the original predetermination; the Gentiles having now the spiritual inheritance which God had pointed out by the grant made of the promised land to the children of Israel. This is the grand key by which this predestination business is unlocked. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#011">Eph 1:11</A> (note). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006">Ephesians 1:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">eph 1:6</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>To the praise of the glory of his grace - &#x394;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#903; The glory of his grace, for &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, his glorious or illustrious grace, according to the Hebrew idiom. But the grace or mercy of God is peculiarly illustrated and glorified in the plan of redemption by Christ Jesus. By the giving of the Law, God's justice and holiness were rendered most glorious; by the giving of the Gospel, his grace and mercy are made equally conspicuous.
<p>Wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved - This translation of &#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788;&#837; &#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x397;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#837; is not clear; with which he has graciously favored us through the Beloved, is at once more literal and more intelligible. Whitby, Macknight, and Wakefield translate the passage in nearly the same way.
<p>In the Beloved must certainly mean in Christ, who is termed God's beloved Son, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017">Mat 3:17</A>; but several excellent MSS., such as D*EFG, the later Syriac, the Ethiopic, Vulgate, Itala, with several of the fathers, add, &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, his beloved Son. This is the meaning, whether the reading be received or rejected. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#007">Ephesians 1:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">eph 1:7</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>In whom we have redemption - God has glorified his grace by giving us redemption by the blood of his Son, and this redemption consists in forgiving and delivering us from our sins; so then Christ's blood was the redemption price paid down for our salvation: and this was according to the riches of his grace; as his grace is rich or abundant in benevolence, so it was manifested in beneficence to mankind, in their redemption by the sacrifice of Christ, the measure of redeeming grace being the measure of God's own eternal goodness.
<p>It may not be useless to remark that, instead of &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, his grace, the Codex Alexandrinus and the Coptic version have &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, his goodness.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">eph 1:8</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Wherein he hath abounded - That is, in the dispensation of mercy and goodness by Christ Jesus.
<p>In all wisdom and prudence - Giving us apostles the most complete instructions in heavenly things by the inspiration of his Spirit; and at the same time prudence, that we might know when and where to preach the Gospel so that it might be effectual to the salvation of those who heard it. Nothing less than the Spirit of God could teach the apostles that wisdom by which they were to instruct a dark and sinful world; and nothing less than the same Spirit could inspire them with that prudence which was necessary to be exercised in every step of their life and ministry. Every wise man is not a prudent man, and every prudent man is not a wise man. Wisdom and prudence may be expected in an apostle who is constantly living under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. "Wisdom," according to Sir William Temple, "is that which makes men judge what are the best ends, and what the best means to attain them; and gives a man advantage of counsel and direction." "Prudence is wisdom applied to practice; or that discreet, apt suiting as well of actions as words, in their due place, time, and manner. Every minister of Christ needs these still; and if he abide not under the influence of both, not only his prayers but his ministerial labors will be all hindered.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">eph 1:9</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Having made known unto us the mystery - That the Gentiles should ever be received into the Church of God, and have all the privileges of the Jews, without being obliged to submit to circumcision, and perform the rites and ceremonies of the Jewish law was a mystery - a hidden thing which had never been published before; and now revealed only to the apostles. It was God's will that it should be so, but that will he kept hidden to the present time. A mystery signifies something hidden, but it ceases to be a mystery as soon as it is revealed. See the note on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#011">Mat 13:11</A>; and particularly that on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025">Rom 11:25</A> (note).
<p>Good pleasure - &#x3a4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#903; That benevolent design which he had purposed in himself, not being induced by any consideration from without. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010">Ephesians 1:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">eph 1:10</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>In the dispensation of the fullness of times - &#x395;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;. The word &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, which is the same as our word economy, signifies, as Dr. Macknight has well observed, "the plan which the master of a family, or his steward, has established for the management of the family;" it signifies, also, a plan for the management of any sort of business: and here it means the dispensation of the Gospel, that plan by which God has provided salvation for a lost world; and according to which he intends to gather all believers, both Jews and Gentiles, into one Church under Jesus Christ, their head and governor. See the note on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#045">Mat 24:45</A>, where the word and the office are particularly explained.
<p>The fullness of times - By this phrase we are to understand either the Gospel dispensation, which is the consummation of all preceding dispensations, and the last that shall be afforded to man; or that advanced state of the world which God saw to be the most proper for the full manifestation of those benevolent purposes which he had formed in himself relative to the salvation of the world by Jesus Christ.
<p>That he might gather together in one - &#x391;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, from &#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;, again, and &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c9;, to reduce to one sum; to add up; to bring different sums together, and fractions of sums, so as to reduce them under one denomination; to recapitulate the principal matters contained in a discourse. Here it means the gathering together both Jews and Gentiles, who have believed in Christ, into one Church and flock. See the preceding note.
<p>All things - which are in heaven, and which are on earth - This clause is variously understood: some think, by things in heaven the Jewish state is meant and by things on earth the Christian. The Jews had been long considered a Divine or heavenly people; their doctrine, their government, their constitution, both civil and ecclesiastical, were all Divine or heavenly: as the powers of the heavens, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029">Mat 24:29</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#026">Luk 21:26</A>, mean the Jewish rulers in Church and state, it is very possible that the things which are in heaven mean this same state; and as the Gentiles were considered to have nothing Divine or heavenly among them, they may be here intended by the earth, out of the corruption of which they are to be gathered by the preaching of the Gospel. But there are others who imagine that the things in heaven mean the angelical hosts; and the things on earth believers of all nations, who shall all be joined together at last in one assembly to worship God throughout eternity. And some think that the things in heaven mean the saints who died before Christ's advent, and who are not to be made perfect till the resurrection, when the full power and efficacy of Christ shall be seen in raising the bodies of believers and uniting them with their holy souls, to reign in his presence for ever. And some think that, as the Hebrew phrase &#1513;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;  shamayim vehaarets, the heavens and the earth, signifies all creatures, the words in the text are to be understood as signifying all mankind, without discrimination of peoples, kindreds, or tongues; Jews, Greeks, or barbarians. All that are saved of all nations, (being saved in the same way, viz. by faith in Christ Jesus, without any distinction of nation or previous condition), and all gathered into one Church or assembly.
<p>I believe that the forming one Church out of both Jews and Gentiles is that to which the apostle refers. This agrees with what is said, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014">Eph 2:14-17</A>.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#011">Ephesians 1:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">eph 1:11</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>In whom - Christ Jesus; also we - believing Jews have obtained an inheritance - what was promised to Abraham and his spiritual seed, viz. the adoption of sons, and the kingdom of heaven, signified by the privileges under the Mosaic dispensation, and the possession of the promised land, but all these privileges being forfeited by the rebellion and unbelief of the Jews, they are now about to be finally cut off, and the believing part to be re-elected, and put in possession of the blessings promised to Abraham and his spiritual seed, by faith; for without a re-election, they cannot get possession of these spiritual privileges.
<p>Being predestinated - God having determined to bring both Jews and Gentiles to salvation, not by works, nor by any human means or schemes, but by Jesus Christ; that salvation being defined and determined before in the Divine mind, and the means by which it should be brought about all being according to his purpose, who consults not his creatures, but operates according to the counsel of his own will, that being ever wise, gracious, and good.
<p>The original reference is still kept up here in the word &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;, being predestinated, as in the word &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#005">Eph 1:5</A>. And as the apostle speaks of obtaining the inheritance, he most evidently refers to that of which the promised land was the type and pledge. And as that land was assigned to the Israelites by limit and lot, both of which were appointed by God so the salvation now sent to the Gentiles was as expressly their lot or portion, as the promised land was that of the people of Israel. All this shows that the Israelites were a typical people; their land, the manner of possessing it, their civil and religious code, etc., etc., all typical; and that in, by, and through them, God had fore-determined, fore-described, and fore-ascertained a greater and more glorious people, among whom the deepest counsels of his wisdom should be manifested, and the most powerful works of his eternal mercy, grace, holiness, goodness, and truth, be fully exhibited. Thus there was nothing fortuitous in the Christian scheme; all was the result of infinite counsel and design. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#005">Eph 1:5</A> (note).

<p>That we - Jews, now apostles and messengers of God, to whom the first offers of salvation were made, and who were the first that believed in Christ.
<p>Should be to the praise of his glory - By being the means of preaching Christ crucified to the Gentiles, and spreading the Gospel throughout the world. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013">Ephesians 1:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">eph 1:13</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>In whom ye also trusted - Ye Gentiles, having heard from us the word, &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, the doctrine, of the truth, which is the Gospel, or glad tidings, of your salvation, have believed, as we Jews have done, and received similar blessings to those with which God has favored us.
<p>In whom also, &#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3c9;&#788;, through whom, Christ Jesus, after that ye had believed, viz. that he was the only Savior, and that through his blood redemption might be obtained, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise; that is, The Holy Spirit, which is promised to them who believe on Christ Jesus, was given to you, and thus you were ascertained to be the children of God, for God has no child who is not a partaker of the Holy Ghost, and he who has this Spirit has God's seal that he belongs to the heavenly family. It was customary among all nations, when a person purchased goods of any kind, to mark with his seal that which he had bought, in order that he might know it, and be able to claim it if mixed with the goods of others; to this custom the apostle may here allude but it was also customary to set a seal upon what was dedicated to God, or what was to be offered to him in sacrifice. See this proved in the note on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#027">Joh 6:27</A>. The Jews themselves speak of the seal of God, which they term &#1488;&#1502;&#1514;  emeth, truth, and which they consider as a representation of the unoriginated and endless perfections of God. As the apostle is here speaking of the doctrine of truth, which came by the Holy Spirit, and is sealed on the souls of believers by this Spirit, he may have in view the Jewish notion, which is at once both correct and elevated. This Spirit of truth, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#017">Joh 14:17</A>, who leads into all truth, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#013">Joh 16:13</A>, and teaches all things, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#026">Joh 14:26</A>, makes the impression of his own eternal purity and truth in the souls of them who believe, and thus they bear the seal of God Almighty. And they who in the day of judgment are found to bear this seal - Truth; truth in the inward parts, having truly repented, truly believed, and having been in consequence truly justified, and truly sanctified; and having walked in truth and sincerity towards God and man; these are sealed to the day of redemption; for, having this seal, they are seen to have a right to eternal life.

<p>Which is the earnest of our inheritance - This Holy Spirit, sealing the soul with truth and righteousness, is the earnest, foretaste, and pledge of the heavenly inheritance. And he who can produce this earnest - this witness of the Spirit, in the day of judgment, shall have an abundant entrance into the holiest. On the &#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, or earnest, see the notes on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#017">Gen 38:17</A> (note), etc., and on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#022">Co2 1:22</A> (note).
<p>The redemption of the purchased possession - That is, till the time when body and soul are redeemed from all their miseries, and glorified in the kingdom on heaven.
<p>The redemption of the purchased possession - &#x391;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; is variously understood; and indeed the original is variously translated. Dr. Whitby has observed that the verb &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; signifies to save alive; and he refers the &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, here, to the redemption of the body from corruption, and to its final glorification with the soul.
<p>All those who believe in Christ Jesus are considered as his peculiar people and property, and to them eternal glory is promised. The Spirit of promise, which is given them, is a pledge that they shall have a resurrection from the dead, and eternal blessedness; the redemption, or bringing to life of the body, cannot take place till the day of judgment, but the Holy Spirit promises this redemption, and is now in their hearts an earnest or pledge of this complete restoration at the great day, which will then be, in an especial manner, to the praise of his glory, viz. of Christ, who has bought them by his blood.

<p>Faith in the Lord Jesus - Cordial reception of the Christian religion, amply proved by their love to all the saints - to all the Christians. Perhaps love here implies, not only the kind affection so called, but also all the fruits of love - benevolence, and kind offices of every description.

<p>Cease not to give thanks - The apostle intimates, so fully satisfied was he of the genuineness of their conversion, and of their steadiness since their conversion, that it was to him a continual cause of thanksgiving to God, who had brought them into that state of salvation; and of prayer, that they might be preserved blameless to the end.
<p>Making mention of you - While praying for the prosperity of the Christian cause generally, he was led, from his particular affection for them, to mention them by name before God.

<p>That the God of our Lord Jesus - Jesus Christ, as man and mediator, has the Father for his God and Father: and it is in reference to this that he himself says: I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017">Joh 20:17</A>.
<p>The Father of glory - The author and giver of that glory which you expect at the end of your Christian race. This may be a Hebraism for glorious Father, but the former appears to be the best sense.
<p>The Spirit of wisdom and revelation - I pray that God may give you his Holy Spirit, by whom his will is revealed to men, that he may teach and make you wise unto salvation, that you may continue to acknowledge him, Christ Jesus, as your only Lord and Savior.

<p>The eyes of your understanding being enlightened - The understanding is that power or faculty in the soul by which knowledge or information is received, and the recipient power is here termed the Eyes of the understanding; and we learn from this that &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;, &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#837; &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;, as Philo expresses it: What the eye is to the body, the understanding is to the soul; and that as the eye is not light in itself, and can discern nothing but by the means of light shining, not only on the objects to be viewed, but into the eye itself; so the understanding of man can discern no sacred thing of or by itself, but sees by the influence of the Spirit of wisdom and revelation; for without the influence of God's Holy Spirit no man ever became wise unto salvation, no more than a man ever discerned an object, (no matter how perfect soever his eye might have been), without the instrumentality of light.
<p>Instead of &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, of your understanding, &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, of your heart, is the reading of ABDEFG, and several others; also both the Syriac, all the Arabic, the Coptic, the Ethiopic, Armenian, Sahidic, Slavonian, Vulgate, and Itala, besides several of the fathers. The eyes of your Heart is undoubtedly the true reading.
<p>The hope of his calling - That you may clearly discern the glorious and important objects of your hope, to the enjoyment of which God has called or invited you.
<p>The riches of the glory of his inheritance - That you may understand what is the glorious abundance of the spiritual things to which you are entitled, in consequence of being made children of God; for if children, then heirs, heirs of that glorious inheritance which God has provided for the saints - for all genuine Christians, whether formerly Jews or Gentiles. On the chief subject of this verse, see the notes on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006">Gal 4:6</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#007">Gal 4:7</A> (note).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">eph 1:19</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The exceeding greatness of his power - As the apostle is here speaking of the glorious state of believers after death, the exceeding greatness of his power, or that power which surpasses all difficulties, being itself omnipotent, is to be understood of that might which is to be exerted in raising the body at the last day; as it will require the same power or energy which he wrought in Christ, when he raised his body from the grave, to raise up the bodies of all mankind; the resurrection of the human nature of Christ being a proof of the resurrection of mankind in general.
<p>According to the working of his mighty power - &#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#903; According to the energy of the power of his might. We may understand these words thus: Might, &#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;, is the state or simple efficiency of this attribute in God; Power, &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, is this might or efficiency in action; Energy, &#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, is the quantum of force, momentum, or velocity, with which the power is applied. Though they appear to be synonymous terms they may be thus understood: passive power is widely different from power in action; and power in action will be in its results according to the energy or momentum with which it is applied. The resurrection of the dead is a stupendous work of God; it requires his might in sovereign action; and when we consider that all mankind are to be raised and changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, then the momentum, or velocity, with which the power is to be applied must be inconceivably great. All motion is in proportion to the quantity of matter in the mover, and the velocity with which it is applied. The effect here is in proportion to the cause and the energy he puts forth in order to produce it. But such is the nature of God's power in action, that it is perfectly inconceivable to us; and even these astonishingly strong words of the apostle are to be understood as used in condescension to human weakness.

<p>Set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places - Gave him, as mediator between God and man, the highest honors and dignities, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009">Phi 2:9</A>; in which state of exaltation he transacts all the affairs of his Church, and rules the universe.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">eph 1:21</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Far above all principality - The difficulty in this verse does not arise from the words themselves, the meaning of each being easily understood, but from the sense in which the apostle uses them. Some think he has reference here to the different orders among good and evil angels; he is superior to all the former, and rules all the latter. Others think he refers to earthly governments; and as &#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;, principality, the first word, signifies the most sovereign and extensive kind of dominion; and &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;, lordship, the last word, signifies the lowest degree of authority; hence we are to understand that to our Lord, in his human nature, are subjected the highest, the intermediate, and the lowest orders of beings in the universe. - Chandler. Others imagine that the apostle has in view, by whatsoever is named in this world, all the dignitaries of the Jewish Church; and by what is named in the world to come, all the dignities that should be found in the Christian Church.
<p>Schoettgen supposes that the "apostle's &#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7; (for &#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;, the abstract for the concrete) means the same as the &#1504;&#1513;&#1497;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;  Nesiim among the Jews, whose chief business it was to clear and decide all contentions which arose concerning traditions and legal controversies.
<p>"That &#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, power, is the same as &#1510;&#1493;&#1512;&#1489;&#1488;  tsorba, he who possesses authority to propound, expound, persuade, convince, and refute.
<p>"That &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, might, answers to &#1512;&#1489;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;  rabbanoth, signifying all the class of rabbins, whose office it was to expound the law, and teach the people generally.
<p>"And that &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;, dominion, answers to &#1502;&#1512;  mar, which signifies a person above the lower orders of men. And he observes that Jesus Christ, after his resurrection, called fishermen, publicans, and men from the lowest orders of the people, to the work of the ministry; and made them instruments of confounding and overturning all the Jewish rulers, rabbins, and doctors. And that in the world which is to come - the successive ages of Christianity, he should ever be exalted above all those powers and authorities which Antichrist might bring into the Christian Church; such as popes, cardinals, wicked archbishops, bishops, deans, and canons; and all those who among the schoolmen were termed seraphic doctors, angelic doctors, most illuminated, most perfect, and irrefragable doctors. And although Wiclif, Huss, Luther, Melancthon, and the rest of the reformers, were men of little or no note when compared with the rulers of the popish Church, so eminently did the power of Christ work in and by them, that the pope and all his adjutants were every where confounded, and their power and authority annihilated in several entire regions."
<p>It is certain that the apostle means that all created power, glory, and influence, are under Christ; and hence it is added:

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">eph 1:22</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>And hath put all things under his feet - All beings and things are subject to him, whether they be thrones, dominions, principalities, or powers, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016">Col 1:16-18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#010">Col 2:10</A>; for he, God the Father, has given him to be head - chief, and supreme, over all, to the Church, the Church having no ruler but Jesus Christ; others may be officers in his Church, but he alone is head and supreme. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#023">Ephesians 1:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">eph 1:23</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Which is his body - As he is head over all things, he is head to the Church; and this Church is considered as the body of which he is especially the head; and from him, as the head, the Church receives light, life, and intelligence.
<p>And is the fullness of him - That in which he especially manifests his power, goodness, and truth; for though he fills all the world with his presence, yet he fills all the members of his mystical body with wisdom, goodness, truth, and holiness, in an especial manner. Some understand the fullness or &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, here, as signifying the thing to be filled; so the Christian Church is to be filled by him, whose fullness fills all his members, with all spiritual gifts and graces. And this corresponds with what St. John says, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016">Joh 1:16</A> : And of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace. And with what is said, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009">Col 2:9</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#010">Col 2:10</A> : Ye are complete in him; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#903; And ye are in him filled full; i.e. with gifts and grace.
<p>How, in any other sense, the Church can be said to be the fullness of him who fills all in all, is difficult to say. However, as Jesus Christ is represented to be the head, and the Church, the body under that head, the individuals being so many members in that body; and as it requires a body and members to make a head complete; so it requires a Church, or general assembly of believers, to make up the body of Christ. When, therefore, the Jews and Gentiles are brought into this Church, the body may be said to be complete; and thus Christ has his visible fullness upon earth, and the Church may be said to be the fullness of him, etc. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010">Eph 1:10</A>.
