*Commentary on the Bible*, by Adam Clarke, \[1831\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Romans Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md)

St. Paul shows the Romans his Divine call to the apostleship, and for
what end he was thus called, [Rom
1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md). His salutation to the Church at
Rome, and his commendation of their faith, [Rom
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#007.md), [Rom
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#008.md). His earnest desire to see them,
that he might impart to them some spiritual gifts, [Rom
1:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#009.md). His description of the Gospel
of Christ, [Rom 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016.md), [Rom
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017.md). The crimes and profligacy of the
Gentile world, which called aloud for the judgments of God, [Rom
1:18-32](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018.md).

Preliminary Observations

Different interpreters have divided this epistle into certain parts or
divisions, by which they suppose its subject and matter may be the
better understood. Some of these divisions have been mentioned in the
preceding preface.

The epistle contains three grand divisions.

I. The Preface, Romans 1:1-17.

II\. The Tractation, or setting forth of the main subject, including two
sections:

1\. Dogmatic, or what relates to doctrine.

2\. Paraenetic, or what relates to the necessity and importance of the
virtues and duties of the Christian life.

The dogmatic part is included in the first eleven chapters, the grand
object of which is to show that eternal salvation cannot be procured by
any observance of the Jewish law, and can be hoped for only on the
Christian scheme; for by the works of the law no man can be justified;
but what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh,
God has accomplished by sending his Son into the world, who, becoming an
offering for sin, condemned sin in the flesh. The paraenetic part
commences with [Rom 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001.md) : I beseech
you, therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your
bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your
reasonable service, etc.; and extends to [Rom
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#014.md).

III\. The peroration or epilogue, which contains the author's apology
for writing; his commendation of his apostolical office; his promise to
visit them; his request of an interest in their prayers; his
commendations of certain persons, and his salutations to others. These
points are contained in the succeeding parts of the epistle, from [Rom
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#014.md) to [Rom
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#024.md). The 25th, 26th, and 27th verses
([Rom 16:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025).md) of this chapter
evidently belong to another part of the epistle, and should come in, as
they do in a vast majority of the best MSS., after [Rom
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#023.md).

For every thing necessary to a general knowledge of the epistle itself,
see the preceding preface.

The inscriptions to this epistle are various in the different MSS. and
versions. The following are the principal: - To the Romans - The Epistle
of Paul to the Romans - The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans -
The Epistle of the Holy Apostle Paul to the Romans. The word αγιος,
holy, we have translated saint; and thus, instead of saying the holy
Paul, etc., we say Saint Paul, etc.; and this is now brought into
general use. The older the MSS. are, the more simple the appellatives
given to apostles and apostolic men.

[Romans 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 1:1</span></span>

Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ - The word δουλος, which we translate
servant, properly means a slave, one who is the entire property of his
master; and is used here by the apostle with great propriety. He felt he
was not his own, and that his life and powers belonged to his heavenly
owner, and that he had no right to dispose of or employ them but in the
strictest subserviency to the will of his Lord. In this sense, and in
this spirit, he is the willing slave of Jesus Christ; and this is,
perhaps, the highest character which any soul of man can attain on this
side eternity. "I am wholly the Lord's; and wholly devoted in the spirit
of sacrificial obedience, to the constant, complete, and energetic
performance of the Divine will." A friend of God is high; a son of God
is higher; but the servant, or, in the above sense, the slave of God, is
higher than all; - in a word, he is a person who feels he has no
property in himself, and that God is all and in all.

Called to be an apostle - The word αποστολος, apostle, from αποστελλειν,
to send, signifies simply a messenger or envoy; one sent on a
confidential errand: but here it means an extraordinary messenger; one
sent by God himself to deliver the most important message on behalf of
his Maker; - in a word, one sent by the Divine authority to preach the
Gospel to the nations. The word κλητος, called, signifies here the same
as constituted, and should be joined with αποστολος, as it is in the
Greek, and translated thus: Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, constituted
an apostle, etc. This sense the word called has in many places of the
sacred writings; e. g. Behold what manner of love the Father hath
bestowed on us, that we should be called, κληθωμεν, Constituted, or made
the sons of God. As it is likely that no apostle had been employed in
founding the Church of Rome, and there was need of much authority to
settle the matters that were there in dispute, it was necessary he
should show them that he derived his authority from God, and was
immediately delegated by him to preach and write as he was now doing.

Separated unto the Gospel - Set apart and appointed to this work, and to
this only; as the Israelites were separate from all the people of the
earth, to be the servants of God: see [Lev
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#026.md). St. Paul may here refer to his
former state as a Pharisee, which literally signifies a separatist, or
one separated. Before he was separated unto the service of his own sect;
now he is separated unto the Gospel of God. On the word Gospel, and its
meaning, see the preface to the notes on St. Matthew; and for the
meaning of the word Pharisee, see the same Gospel, [Mat
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#007) (note.md).

[Romans 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 1:2</span></span>

Which he had promised afore - Both in the law and in the prophets God
showed his purpose to introduce into the world a more perfect and
glorious state of things; which state was to take place by and under the
influence of the Messiah, who should bring life and immortality to light
by his Gospel.

[Romans 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 1:3</span></span>

Concerning his Son - That is, the Gospel relates every thing concerning
the conception, birth, preaching, miracles, passion, death,
resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ, who was of the seed-royal,
being, as far as his humanity was considered, the son of David, and then
the only rightful heir to the Israelitish throne.

[Romans 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 1:4</span></span>

And declared to be the Son of God - See the note on [Act
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#033.md), where this subject is
considered at large. The word ορισθεντος, which we render declared,
comes from οριζω, to bound, define, determine, or limit, and hence our
word horizon, the line that determines the farthest visible part of the
earth, in reference to the heavens. In this place the word signifies
such a manifest and complete exhibition of the subject as to render it
indubitable. The resurrection of Christ from the dead was such a
manifest proof of our Lord's innocence, the truth of his doctrine, and
the fulfillment of all that the prophets had spoken, as to leave no
doubt on any considerate and candid mind.

With power - εν δυναμει, With a miraculous display of Divine energy;
for, how could his body be raised again, but by the miraculous energy of
God? Some apply the word here to the proof of Christ's sonship; as if it
were said that he was most manifestly declared to be the Son of God,
with such powerful evidence and argument as to render the truth
irresistible.

According to the spirit of holiness - There are many differences of
sentiment relative to the meaning of this phrase in this place; some
supposing that the spirit of holiness implies the Divine nature of Jesus
Christ; others, his immaculate sanctity, etc. To me it seems that the
apostle simply means that the person called Jesus, lately crucified at
Jerusalem, and in whose name salvation was preached to the world, was
the Son of God, the very Messiah promised before in the holy Scriptures;
and that he was this Messiah was amply demonstrated.

1st, By his resurrection from the dead, the irrefragable proof of his
purity, innocence, and the Divine approbation; for, had he been a
malefactor, as the Jews pretended, the miraculous power of God would not
have been exerted in raising his body from the dead.

2nd, He was proved to be the Son of God, the promised Messiah, by the
Holy Spirit, (called here the spirit of holiness), which he sent down
upon his apostles, and not on them only, but on all that believed on his
name; by whose influence multitudes were convinced of sin,
righteousness, and judgment, and multitudes sanctified unto God; and it
was by the peculiar unction of this spirit of holiness, that the
apostles gave witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, [Act
4:33](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#033.md).

Thus, then, Christ was proved to be the true Messiah, the son of David
according to the flesh, having the sole right to the throne of Israel;
and God recognized this character, and this right, by his resurrection
from the dead, and sending forth the various gifts and graces of the
Spirit of holiness in his name.

[Romans 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 1:5</span></span>

Grace and apostleship - The peculiar influence and the essential
qualifications which such an office requires. Without the Grace, favor,
and peculiar help of God, he could not have been an apostle: he had an
extraordinary conversion, and an extraordinary call to preach the
Gospel. Probably χαριν και αποστολην, grace and apostleship, mean the
same as χαριν της αποστολης, the apostolical office; for so the word
χαρις means in [Rom 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#003.md); [Rom
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#015.md); [Co1
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#010.md); [Eph
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#008.md). See the various acceptations of
the word grace, [Rom 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#007.md).

For obedience to the faith - That by this office, which I have received
from God, and the power by which it is accompanied, I might proclaim the
faith, the Gospel of Jesus; and show all nations the necessity of
believing in it, in order to their salvation. Here is:

1\. The Gospel of the Son of God.

2\. An apostle divinely commissioned and empowered to preach it.

3\. The necessity of faith in the name of Jesus, as the only Savior of
the world.

4\. Of obedience, as the necessary consequence of genuine faith. And,

5\. This is to be proclaimed among all nations; that all might have the
opportunity of believing and being saved.

[Romans 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 1:6</span></span>

Ye are the called - Ye Romans are all invited to believe in Christ
Jesus, for the salvation of your souls; and to you, with the rest, my
apostolical mission extends. This appears to be the most obvious sense
of the word called in this place - to be called by the Gospel is to be
invited to believe in Christ Jesus, and become his disciples. The word
sometimes means constituted, or made, as in [Rom
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md).

[Romans 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 1:7</span></span>

Called to be saints - Invited to become holy persons, by believing the
Gospel and receiving the gifts of the Holy Ghost. Or, here, the word may
have the meaning of made or constituted, as above; κλητοις αγιοις, to
all that be in Rome, Constituted saints, for they had already received
the Gospel grace, and were formed into a Christian Church.

Grace to you - χαρις υμιν; May you be partakers of the Divine favor, the
source whence every blessing is derived.

I think it necessary, once for all, to give the several acceptations of
this word grace which occur in the sacred writings.

1\. The word χαριν signifies in general favor or benevolence, but
especially that favor which is powerful and active, and loads its
objects with benefits. [Luk 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#030.md) :
Fear not, Mary, thou hast found Favor, χαριν, with God. [Luk
2:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#040.md) : And the child grew - and the
Grace of God, χαρις θεου, the favor of God was upon him. [Luk
1:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#052.md) : And Jesus increased in Favor,
χαριτι Grace, with God and man. [Act
2:47](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#047.md) : Having Favor, χαριν, Grace,
with all the people. [Act 4:33](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#033.md) : And
great Grace, χαρις, Favor, was upon them all. The apostles were at that
time in universal favor with the multitude. In this sense the word
occurs in a great variety of places, both in the Old and New Testaments.

2\. Hence it is often used for the blessing which it dispenses; for, if
God be favourably disposed towards a person, his beneficent acts, in
that person's behalf, will be a necessary consequence of such favor.
[Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md) : Full of Grace and truth;
accomplished in all spiritual blessings. [Joh
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016.md) : And Grace upon Grace: he who is
full of the most excellent blessings, confers them liberally on all
believers. [Act 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#023.md) : When he had
seen the Grace of God, i.e. had the fullest evidence that they were
richly endowed with heavenly gifts. [Co1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#004.md) : For the Grace of God which is
given you - the Divine blessings conferred upon you. [Co2
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#008.md) : God is able to make all Grace
abound toward you; i.e. to enrich you with every benediction. This is
also a very common acceptation of the word; and in this sense the word
grace or favor is now generally understood among religious people. The
grace of God meaning with them some Divine or spiritual blessing
communicated.

3\. It is sometimes taken for the whole of the Christian religion, as
being the grandest possible display of God's favor to a lost, ruined
world: and in this sense it appears to be used, [Joh
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017.md) : For the Law was given by Moses;
but Grace and truth came by Jesus Christ: where the term Grace is
evidently opposed to Law; the latter meaning the Mosaic, the other the
Christian, dispensation. [Act 13:43](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#043.md) :
Barnabas persuaded them to continue in the Grace of God; i.e. to hold
fast their profession of the religion of Christ. [Rom
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#014.md) : Ye are not under the Law, but
under Grace - ye are no longer under obligation to fulfill the Mosaic
precepts, but are under the Christian dispensation. See also [Rom
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#015.md); and see [Co2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#012.md); [Co2
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#001.md); [Gal
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006.md); [Col
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#006.md); [Ti2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#001.md), [Tit
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#011.md) : The Grace of God, that bringeth
salvation unto all men, hath appeared. The Jewish religion was
restricted in its benefits to a few; but the Christian religion proposes
the salvation of all men; and the author of it has become a sacrifice
for the sins of the whole world. [Heb
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#015.md) : Looking diligently lest any
man fall from the Grace of God - lest any man apostatize from the
Christian religion, and the blessings of pardon and holiness which he
has received through it. [Pe1 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#012.md) :
This is the true Grace of God wherein ye stand - the Christian religion
which ye have received is the genuine religion of God.

4\. It signifies all the blessings and benefits which Christ has
purchased, and which he gives to true believers, both in time and
eternity. See [Rom 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#015.md), [Rom
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#017.md), where the grace of God is
opposed to death; i.e. to all the wretchedness and misery brought into
the world by Adam's transgression. [Co1
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#023.md) : The Grace of the Lord Jesus
Christ be with you all - May every blessing purchased by Christ's
passion and death be the portion of you all. [Gal
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#004.md) : Ye are fallen from Grace - ye
have lost the blessings of the Gospel by submitting to circumcision.

5\. It signifies the apostolic and ministerial office, or the authority
to propagate the Christian religion, and the unction or influence by
which that office is executed; so in the 5th verse of this chapter,
([Rom 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#005).md) as has been already noted:
By whom we have received Grace and apostleship, or, the apostolic
office. [Rom 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#003.md) : I say, through the
Grace given unto me; i.e. I command you, by the authority of my
apostolic office, etc. See also [Rom
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#006.md).

6\. It signifies a gift, salary, or money collected for the use of the
poor. [Co1 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#003.md) : Whomsoever ye shall
approve - them will I send to bring your Liberality, την χαριν υμων,
your Grace; i.e. the collection made for the poor saints: see [Co1
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#001.md). [Co2
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#004.md) : Praying us - that we would
receive the Gift, την χαριν, the Grace, the contribution made in the
Churches of Macedonia, for the relief of the poor. In this sense it is
used in Ecclus. 17:22: He will keep the Good Deeds of man, χαριν, the
same as ελεημοσυνη, alms, in the beginning of the verse; and it
signifies a kind or friendly act, in the same author. Ecclus. 29:16:
Forget not the Friendship, χαριτας, of thy surety. Graces or χαρις, was
a deity among the ancients; and the three Graces, αι τρεις χαριτες, were
called Pitho, Aglaia, and Euphrosyne; πειθω, mild persuasion; αγλαια,
dignity; ευφροσυνη, liberality and joyfulness; and these were always
painted naked, to show that all benefits should be gratuitous, this
being essential to the nature of a gift. See Suidas, in χαριτας.

7\. It sometimes signifies merely thanks or thanksgiving. See [Luk
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#009.md) : Doth he thank, μη χαριν εχει,
that servant? [Rom 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#017.md) : But God be
Thanked, χαρις οε τω θεω. [Co1 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#030.md) :
For if I by Grace, χαριτι, Thanksgiving, as our margin has it, and
properly.

8\. It signifies remuneration, wages, or reward [Luk
6:32-34](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#032.md) : If ye love them that love
you - do good to them which do good to you - lend to them of whom ye
hope to receive, what Thank have ye? ποια υμιν χαρις εστι; what Reward
have ye? This appears, from the parallel place, [Mat
5:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#046.md), to be most evidently the
meaning: τινα μισθον εχετε; what Reward have ye? The word is used in
this sense by several Greek writers.

9\. It signifies whatever is the means of procuring the favor or
kindness of another. [Pe1 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#019.md), [Pe1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#020.md) : For this is Thankworthy, τουτο
γαρ χαρις παρα τῳ Θεῳ, this is the means of Procuring Favor from God.

10\. It signifies joy, pleasure, and gratification, which is the,
meaning of cara, and with which it is often confounded in the New
Testament. [Plm 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#007.md) : For we have
great Joy, χαριν γαρ εχομεν πολλην. Tobit 7:18: The Lord give thee Joy,
χαριν, for this thy sorrow. In this sense the word is used by the best
Greek writers; and in this sense it appears to be used, [Co2
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#015.md).

11\. It signifies the performance of an act which is pleasing or
grateful to others. [Act 24:27](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#027.md) :
Felix, willing to show the Jews a Pleasure, χαριτας καταθεσθαι, to
perform an act which he knew would be highly gratifying to them.

12\. It signifies whatever has the power or influence to procure favor,
etc. Suavity, kindness, benevolence, gentle demeanour. [Luk
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#022.md) : All wondered at the Gracious
Words, τοις λογοις της χαριτος, the benevolent, kind, and tender
expressions; such as his text, [Luk
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018.md), would naturally lead him to
speak. He hath anointed me to preach the Gospel to the poor; he hath
sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the
captives, etc. [Eph 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#029.md); [Col
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#006.md) : Let your speech be always with
Grace; i.e. gracious, kind, benevolent, savouring of the doctrine of
Christ: it is thus used by several Greek writers. See Schleusner. As the
word χαρις Grace, most frequently signifies some blessing or benefit
calculated to promote human happiness, it is generally derived from
χαρω, I rejoice, because of the effect produced by the blessing.

And peace - ειρηνη, the same as שלום shalom in Hebrew, generally
signifying all kinds of blessing, but especially harmony and unity, and
the bond of such unity. The most probable derivation of the word ειρηνη
is from ειρω, I bind, and εν, one - because peace unites and binds those
who were, by discord, before disunited. In the New Testament it
signifies -

1\. Peace, public or private, in the general acceptation of the word, as
implying reconciliation and friendship; and to the etymology of the word
the apostle seems to allude in [Eph
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#003.md) : Endeavouring to keep the Unity
of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace. [Act
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#020.md) : They of Tyre and Sidon desired
Peace - they sought reconciliation, with Herod, by means of Blastus, the
king's chamberlain.

2\. It signifies regularity, good order. [Co1
14:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#033.md) : God is not the God of
confusion, but of Peace.

3\. It signifies the labor or study of preserving peace and concord; and
this is supposed to be its meaning, [Mat
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#034.md); [Luk
12:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#051.md); and [Act
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#026.md). [Rom
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#017.md) : For the kingdom of God is
righteousness and Peace - the Christian dispensation admits of no
contention, but inculcates peace. [Co1
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#015.md) : God hath called us to Peace -
to labor to preserve quietness and concord. [Heb
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#014.md) : Follow Peace - labor to
preserve it.

4\. It signifies the author or procurer of peace and concord. [Eph
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014.md) : He is our Peace - the author of
concord betwixt Jews and Gentiles.

5\. It signifies the Gospel and its blessings. [Eph
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#017.md) : And came and preached Peace to
you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.

6\. It signifies all kinds of mental and corporeal happiness, and
especially the happiness of Christians. [Luk
1:79](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#079.md) : To guide our feet into the way
of Peace - to show us the way to obtain true happiness. [Luk
19:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#042.md) : The things which belong unto
thy Peace - that by which thou mightest have been made truly happy. [Th1
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023.md) : The very God of Peace - God,
the only source of true felicity. [Joh
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#033.md) : These things have I spoken
unto you, that in me ye might have Peace - that ye might have confidence
and happiness in believing on me as your only Savior.

7\. It signifies good wishes and affectionate prayers. [Mat
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#013.md) : And if the house be worthy,
let your Peace come upon it. Our Lord commands his disciples, [Mat
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#012.md), to salute the house into which
they entered; and this was done by saying, Peace be unto this house!
that is, Let every blessing, spiritual and temporal, be the portion of
this family! See [Luk 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#006.md); [Joh
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#027.md); [Act
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#033.md) : They were let go in Peace -
they had the most fervent and affectionate prayers of the Church.

8\. It signifies praise. [Luk 19:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#038.md) :
Peace in heaven and glory in the highest! - May all the heavenly host
praise God, and give him the highest honor!

9\. It signifies benignity, benevolence, favor. [Rom
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001.md) : Being justified by faith, we
have Peace with God - In consequence of having our sins forgiven, we
have a clear sense of the Divine favor. [Phi
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#007.md) : The Peace of God which passeth
all understanding - the inexpressible blessedness of a sense of the
Divine favor. See Schleusner's Lexicon.

From God our Father - The apostle wishes them all the blessings which
can flow from God, as the fountain of grace, producing in them all the
happiness which a heart filled with the peace of God can possess; all of
which are to be communicated to them through the Lord Jesus Christ. See
the note on [Act 28:31](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#031.md).

[Romans 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rom 1:8</span></span>

First, I thank my God - From this to the end of [Rom
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017.md) belongs to the preface, in which
the apostle endeavors to conciliate the good opinion of the Christians
at Rome, and to prepare their minds for his reproofs and exhortations.

Your faith is spoken - καταγγελλεται, is celebrated, throughout the
whole world - in every place where the Christian religion is professed,
through all parts of the Roman dominions; for in this sense we should
understand the words, the whole world.

[Romans 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rom 1:9</span></span>

Whom I serve with my spirit - λατπευω Whom I worship with the
profoundest religious reverence; for so the original certainly means: I
not only employ all the powers of my body in this service, but all those
of my soul; being thoroughly convinced of the absolute truth of the
religion I preach. Probably St. Paul opposes, in this place, the
spiritual worship of the Gospel to the external, or what some call the
carnal, worship of the Jews. Mine is not a religion of ceremonies, but
one in which the life and power of the eternal Spirit are acknowledged
and experienced.

[Romans 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rom 1:10</span></span>

Making request, etc. - By this we see how earnestly the apostle longed
to see Rome. It had long been a subject of continual prayer to God, that
he might have a prosperous journey to, or rather meeting with, them, for
so we should understand the word ευοδωθησμαι· that he had a prosperous
meeting with them we cannot doubt; that he had a disastrous journey to
them the 27th of the Acts fully proves.

[Romans 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rom 1:11</span></span>

Some spiritual gift - This probably means some of the extraordinary
gifts of the Holy Spirit, which, being given to them, might tend greatly
to establish their faith in the Gospel of Christ; and it is very likely
that such gifts were only conferred by means of apostles; and as the
apostle had not yet been at Rome, consequently the Roman Christians had
not yet received any of these miraculous gifts, and thus they differed
widely from all the other Churches which had been raised by the
apostle's ministry.

[Romans 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rom 1:12</span></span>

That I may be comforted together with you - He here, with great address,
intimates that he longs for this opportunity, as well on his own account
as on theirs, and to show them that he arrogates nothing to himself; for
he intimates that it will require the conjoint action of their faith as
well as his own, to be the means of receiving those blessings from God
to which he refers.

[Romans 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rom 1:13</span></span>

But was let hitherto - The word let, from the Anglo-Saxon to hinder,
signifies impediment or hinderance of any kind: but it is likely that
the original word, εκωλυθην, I was forbidden, refers to a Divine
prohibition: - he would have visited them long before, but God did not
see right to permit him.

[Romans 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rom 1:14</span></span>

I am a debtor both to the Greeks, and to the barbarians - It has been
remarked before that all the nations of the earth, themselves excepted,
were termed barbarians by the Greeks. See the origin of the word
barbarous in the note on [Act 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#002.md)
(note). The apostle considers himself, by his apostolical office and
call, under obligation to preach the Gospel to all people, as far as the
providence of God might open his way; for this is implied in the Divine
commission: - Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every
creature - to the wise and the unwise; to the learned and cultivated as
well as to the unlearned and uncultivated. This evidently appears to be
the import of the terms.

[Romans 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rom 1:15</span></span>

I am ready to preach - προθυμον; I have a ready mind. I was only
prevented by the providence of God from visiting you long ago. His time
is best: in the mean time I write, by his direction, to comfort and
instruct you.

[Romans 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 1:16</span></span>

I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ - This text is best illustrated
by [Isa 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016.md); [Isa
49:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#023.md), quoted by the apostle, [Rom
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#011.md) : For the Scripture saith,
Whosoever believeth on him, shall not be ashamed; i.e. they shall
neither be confounded, nor disappointed of their hope. The Jews, by not
believing on Jesus Christ, by not receiving him as the promised Messiah,
but trusting in others, have been disappointed, ashamed, and confounded,
from that time to the present day. Their expectation is cut off; and,
while rejecting Christ, and expecting another Messiah, they have
continued under the displeasure of God, and are ashamed of their
confidence. On the other hand, those who have believed on Christ have,
in and through him, all the blessings of which the prophets spoke; every
promise of God being yea and amen through him. Paul, as a Jew, believed
on Christ Jesus; and in believing he had life through his name; through
him he enjoyed an abundance of grace; so that, being filled with that
happiness which an indwelling Christ produces, he could cheerfully say,
I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ. And why? Because he felt it to
be the power of God to the salvation of his believing soul. This appears
to be the true sense of this passage, and this interpretation acquires
additional strength from the consideration that St. Paul is here most
evidently addressing himself to the Jews.

It is the power of God unto salvation - δυναμις γαρ θεου εστιν· The
almighty power of God accompanies this preaching to the souls of them
that believe; and the consequence is, they are saved; and what but the
power of God can save a fallen, sinful soul?

To the Jew first - Not only the Jews have the first offer of this
Gospel, but they have the greatest need of it; being so deeply fallen,
and having sinned against such glorious privileges, they are much more
culpable than the Gentiles, who never had the light of a Divine
revelation.

And also to the Greek - Though the salvation of God has hitherto been
apparently confined to the Jewish people, yet it shall be so no longer,
for the Gospel of Christ is sent to the Gentiles as well as the Jews;
God having put no difference between them; and Jesus Christ having
tasted death for Every man.

[Romans 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 1:17</span></span>

For therein - In the Gospel of Christ.

Is the righteousness of God - God's method of saving sinners.

Revealed from faith to faith - Shown to be by faith, and not by the
works of any law; for Abraham, the father and founder of the Jewish
people, was justified by faith, before even the law was given; and by
believing, in reference to the spiritual object held forth in the
various ordinances of the law, and now revealed under the Gospel, he and
all his believing descendants have been justified. And thus the faith of
the old covenant led on to the faith of the new covenant, which shows
that salvation has been by faith from the call of Abraham to the present
time. And, from the beginning, all that were just or righteous in the
earth became such by faith, and by this principle alone they were
enabled to persevere; as it is written, The just shall live by faith.
That δικαιοσυνη, which we translate righteousness in this verse,
signifies God's method of saving mankind by faith in Christ, is fully
evident from the use of the term in [Rom
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#030.md) : The Gentiles which followed not
after Righteousness - who had no knowledge by revelation, of God's
method of justifying and saving sinners, have attained to Righteousness
- have had imparted to them God's method of salvation by faith in
Christ. [Rom 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#031.md) : But Israel, the
Jews, which followed after the law of righteousness - that law, the end
or object of which is Christ, and through him justification to all that
believe ([Rom 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#004).md), have not attained
to the law of righteousness - have not found out the genuine plan of
salvation, even in that law which so strongly and generally proclaims
justification by faith. And why have they not found it? [Rom
9:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#032.md) : Because they sought it not by
faith, but as it were by the works of the law - they did not discern
that even its works or prescribed religious observances were intended to
lead to faith in that glorious Mediator of whom they were the types and
representatives; but the Jews trusted in the observances themselves,
hoping to acquire justification and final salvation by that means. For
they stumbled at the stumbling-stone - at the doctrine of Christ
crucified as the only sure ground on which the expectation of future
salvation can be founded. Therefore, being ignorant of God's
righteousness - God's method of saving sinners, and going about to
establish their own righteousness - their own method of salvation, by
the observance of those rites and ceremonies which should have led them
by faith to Christ, they did not submit themselves to the righteousness
of God - they would not submit to be saved in God's way, and therefore
rejected, persecuted, and crucified the Lord Jesus; see [Rom
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#003.md). This collation of passages most
evidently shows that the word righteousness here means simply God's
method of saving sinners, or God's way of salvation, in opposition to
the ways and means invented by the fancies or prejudices of men.

There are few words in the sacred writings which are taken in a greater
variety of acceptations than the word צדקה tsedakah in Hebrew, and
δικαιοσυνη in Greek, both of which we generally translate righteousness.
Our English word was originally rightwiseness, from the Anglo-Saxon
justice, right, and to know; and thus the righteous man was a person who
was allowed to understand the claims of justice and right, and who,
knowing them, acted according to their dictates. Such a man is
thoroughly wise; he aims at the attainment of the best end by the use of
the best means. This is a true definition of wisdom, and the righteous
man is he that knows most and acts best. The Hebrew צדק tsadak, in its
ideal meaning, contains the notion of a beam or scales in equipoise,
what we call even balance; and it is well known that in all the
personifications of Justice, both ancient and modern, she is represented
as a beautiful female with a bandage on her eyes, and a beam and scales
in her hand, so perfectly poised that neither end preponderates.

The Greek word δικαιοσυνη has been derived from διχαζω, to divide; and
hence δικη, justice, because it is the property of this virtue to divide
to each his due. With other etymologies it is useless to trouble the
reader. Both the noun δικαιοσυνη and the verb δικαιοω have a great
variety of meaning in the New Testament; but they are all reducible to
this original idea, acting according to the requisitions of justice or
right. It may not be improper to notice some of the chief of these
acceptations in this place.

1\. The act of distributing to each man his due is the sense of the
word, [Act 17:31](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#031.md) : He will judge the
world in Righteousness, i.e. according to the principles of eternal
justice and rectitude. See also [Rev
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#002.md) : In Righteousness doth he judge
and make war.

2\. It signifies a holy life, as proceeding from piety towards God. [Luk
1:75](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#075.md) : Might serve him in holiness and
Righteousness all the days of our life.

3\. It signifies benignity, liberality, and particularly almsgiving, as
justice and righteousness require us, being only stewards of God's
bounty, to share it with the necessitous. [Mat
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#001.md) : Take heed that ye do not your
Alms, δικαιοσυνην, your Righteousness, before men. [Rom
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#005.md) : But if our unrighteousness
commend the Righteousness, the benignity of God. [Co2
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#010.md) : Increase the fruits of your
Righteousness, i.e. of your liberality.

4\. It signifies God's method of saving sinners; the way which is
agreeable to his righteousness and liberality. See the former part of
this note, and the scriptures there referred to.

5\. It signifies the reward or issue of liberality. [Co2
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#009.md) : He hath scattered abroad; he
hath given to the poor; his Righteousness - the reward of his bounty,
remaineth for ever. See [Psa 112:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#009.md).

6\. It signifies the whole collection of graces, which constitute the
complete Christian character. [Mat 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#006.md)
: Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after Righteousness - they who
ardently long for the full salvation of God. [Mat
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#010.md), [Mat
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#020.md) : If your Righteousness exceed
not the righteousness, etc. [Mat 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#033.md)
: Seek the kingdom of God and his Righteousness.

7\. It signifies the result of faith in God and submission to his will,
exemplified in a holy and useful life. [Heb
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#007.md) : By faith Noah prepared an ark,
and became heir of the Righteousness which is by faith - he escaped the
deluge and became the instrument of repeopling the world.

8\. It signifies an exact observance of religious ordinances and
precepts. [Phi 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#006.md) : Touching the
Righteousness which is of the law, blameless - having lived in an exact
conformity to all the Mosaic precepts. In this sense it is to be
understood, [Mat 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#015.md) : Thus it
becomes us to fulfill all Righteousness - to observe every precept of
the law.

9\. It signifies the favor or pardoning mercy of God. [Rom
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#006.md) : The blessedness of the man unto
whom God imputeth Righteousness - without works - the man is happy to
whom God has granted the remission of sins, without respect to his
observance of the law of Moses.

10\. In [Co2 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021.md), δικαιοσυνη,
righteousness, is put for δικαιος, righteous: That we might become the
righteousness of God - that we might receive such a righteousness or
holiness, such a salvation, as is worthy of God's grace to impart, and
such as the necessities of mankind require.

A few of the leading acceptations of the verb δικαιοω, which we
translate to justify, may be here properly subjoined, as this verb is so
repeatedly used in this epistle.

1\. It signifies so declare or pronounce one just or righteous; or, in
other words, to declare him to be what he really is. [Ti1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016.md) : He was Justified in the Spirit.
- By the almighty power of the Spirit he was proved to be the True
Messiah.

2\. To esteem a thing properly. [Mat
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#019.md) : Wisdom is Justified of her
children. - Wisdom, propriety of conduct, is properly estimated by wise
men.

3\. It signifies to approve, praise, and commend. The publicans
Justified God, [Luk 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#029.md); praised him
for calling them to such a state of salvation. [Luk
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#015.md) : Ye are they which Justify
yourselves before men - Ye are self-commended, self-applauded, and
self-praised. In this sense it is often used in the Greek apocryphal
books. Ecclus. 7:5: Justify not thyself before the Lord - Do not applaud
thyself in the presence of thy - Maker. Ecclus.10:29: Who will Justify
(praise or applaud) him that sinneth against his own soul. Ecclus 18:2:
The Lord only is righteous, δικαιωθησεται, shall be Justified, i.e.
praised, because there is none other but he.

4\. The verb δικαιοομαι is used to clear from all sin. [Co1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#004.md) : For I know nothing by myself;
yet am I not hereby Justified - A man's own consciousness of integrity
is not a proof that he is clear from all sin in the sight of God.

5\. A judge is said to justify not only when he condemns and punishes,
but also when he defends the cause of the innocent. See Eurip. Heraclid.
ver. 190. Thucyd. iii. p. 200. Polyb. iii. 31, and Schleusner on
δικαιοω. Hence δικαιουσθαι is taken in a forensic sense, and signifies
to be found or declared righteous, innocent, etc. [Mat
12:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#037.md) : By thy words shalt thou be
Justified - thou shalt be declared to be righteous. [Rom
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#004.md) : That thou mightest be Justified
in thy saying - that thou mightest be proved to be true in what thou
hast said.

6\. It signifies to set free, to escape from. [Act
13:39](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#039.md) : And by him all that believe
are Justified from all things, from which ye could not be Justified by
the law - by faith in Christ a man escapes those evils which, otherwise,
the law of Moses would inflict upon him. [Rom
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#007.md) : For he that is dead,
δεδικαιωται, is Justified, properly rendered by our translators, is
Freed from sin.

7\. It signifies also to receive one into favor, to pardon sin. [Rom
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030.md) : Whom he called, them he also
Justified - he received them into favor and pardoned their sins. [Luk
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#014.md) : This man went down to his
house Justified - he humbled himself, repented of his iniquity, and God
forgave his sin. [Rom 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#020.md) : By the
deeds of the law there shall no flesh be Justified - no soul can have
his sins forgiven through the observance of the Mosaic law. [Rom
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#002.md) : If Abraham were Justified (had
his sin pardoned) by works. [Co1 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#011.md)
: Such were some of you, but ye are Justified - ye are received into the
Divine favor, and have your sins forgiven. See [Jam
2:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#021.md); [Rom
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024.md), [Rom
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#028.md); [Rom
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001.md), [Rom
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#009.md); [Gal
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#016.md), [Gal
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#017.md); [Gal
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#011.md), [Gal
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#024.md); [Gal
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#004.md); [Tit
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#007.md). In all these texts the word
justify is taken in the sense of remission of sins through faith in
Christ Jesus; and does not mean making the person just or righteous, but
treating him as if he were so, having already forgiven him his sins.

The just shall live by faith - This has been understood two ways:

1\. That the just or righteous man cannot live a holy and useful life
without exercising continual faith in our Lord Jesus: which is strictly
true; for He only who has brought him into that state of salvation can
preserve him in it; and he stands by faith.

2\. It is contended by some able critics that the words of the original
text should be pointed thus: 'ο δε δικαιος εκ πιστεως, ζησεται. The just
by faith, shall live; that is, he alone that is justified by faith shall
be saved: which is also true; as it is impossible to get salvation in
any other way. This last meaning is probably the true one, as the
original text in [Hab 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004.md), speaks of
those who believed the declarations of God when the Chaldeans besieged
Jerusalem, and, having acted conformably to them, escaped with their
lives.

[Romans 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rom 1:18</span></span>

For the wrath of God is revealed - The apostle has now finished his
preface, and comes to the grand subject of the epistle; namely, to show
the absolute need of the Gospel of Christ, because of the universal
corruption of mankind; which was so great as to incense the justice of
God, and call aloud for the punishment of the world

1\. He shows that all the heathen nations were utterly corrupt, and
deserved this threatened punishment. And this is the subject of the
first chapter, from [Rom 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018.md) to the
end ([Rom 1:18-32](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018).md).

2\. He shows that the Jews, notwithstanding the greatness of their
privileges, were no better than the Gentiles; and therefore the wrath of
God was revealed against them also. This subject he treats in Romans
2:1-29 and Romans 3:1-19.

3\. He returns, as it were, on both, [Rom
3:20-31](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#020.md), and proves that, as the Jews
and Gentiles were equally corrupt, they could not be saved by the deeds
of any law; that they stood equally in need of that salvation which God
had provided; that both were equally entitled to that salvation, for God
was the God of the Gentiles as well as of the Jews.

By οργη θεου, the wrath of God, we are not to understand any uneasy
passion in the Divine Being; but the displeasure of his righteousness,
which is expressed by the punishments inflicted on the ungodly, those
who retain not God in their knowledge; and the unrighteous, those whose
lives are profligate.

As, in the Gospel, the righteousness of God is revealed for the
salvation of the ungodly, so is the wrath of God revealed against the
workers of iniquity. Those who refuse to be saved in the way revealed by
his mercy must be consumed in the way revealed by his justice.

Ungodliness - ασεβειαν, from α , negative, and σεβω or σεβομαι, I
worship, probably intended here to express atheism, polytheism, and
idolatry of every kind.

Unrighteousness - αδικιαν from α, negative, and δικη, justice; every
thing contrary to strict morality; all viciousness and profligacy of
conduct.

Who hold the truth in unrighteousness - In what sense could it be said
that the heathen held the truth in unrighteousness, when they really had
not that truth? Some think this refers to the conduct of their best
philosophers, such as Socrates, Plato, Seneca, etc., who knew much more
of the Divine nature than they thought safe or prudent to discover; and
who acted in many things contrary to the light which they enjoyed.
Others think this to be spoken of the Gentiles in general, who either
did know, or might have known, much of God from the works of creation,
as the apostle intimates in the following verses. But Rosenmuller and
some others contend that the word κατεχειν here does not signify to
hold, but to hinder; and that the place should be translated, who
through maliciousness hinder the truth; i.e. prevent it from taking hold
of their hearts, and from governing their conduct. This is certainly a
very usual acceptation of the verb κατεχειν, which Hesychius interprets
κρατειν, κωλυειν, συνεχειν, to retain, hinder, etc.; these men
hindering, by their vicious conduct, the truth of God from being
propagated in the earth.

[Romans 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rom 1:19</span></span>

That which may be known of God - Dr. Taylor paraphrases this and the
following verse thus: "Although the Gentiles had no written revelation,
yet what may be known of God is every where manifest among them, God
having made a clear discovery of himself to them. For his being and
perfections, invisible to our bodily eyes, have been, ever since the
creation of the world, evidently to be seen, if attentively considered,
in the visible beauty, order, and operations observable in the
constitution and parts of the universe; especially his eternal power and
universal dominion and providence: so that they cannot plead ignorance
in excuse of their idolatry and wickedness."

[Romans 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 1:20</span></span>

The invisible things of him - His invisible perfections are manifested
by his visible works, and may be apprehended by what he has made; their
immensity showing his omnipotence, their vast variety and contrivance,
his omniscience; and their adaptation to the most beneficent purposes,
his infinite goodness and philanthropy.

His eternal power - αιδιος αυτου δυναμις, That all-powerful energy that
ever was, and ever will exist; so that, ever since there was a creation
to be surveyed, there have been intelligent beings to make that survey.

And Godhead - θειοτης, His acting as God in the government and support
of the universe. His works prove his being; the government and support
of these works prove it equally. Creation and providence form a twofold
demonstration of God,

1st. in the perfections of his nature; and,

2ndly. in the exercise of those perfections.

[Romans 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 1:21</span></span>

Because that when they knew God - When they thus acquired a general
knowledge of the unity and perfections of the Divine nature, they
glorified him not as God - they did not proclaim him to the people, but
shut up his glory (as Bishop Warburton expresses it) in their mysteries,
and gave the people, in exchange for an incorruptible God, an image made
like to corruptible man. Wherefore God, in punishment for their sins,
thus turning his truth into a lie, suffered even their mysteries, which
they had erected for a school of virtue, to degenerate into an odious
sink of vice and immorality; giving them up unto all uncleanness and
vile affections.

They glorified him not - They did not give him that worship which his
perfections required.

Neither were thankful - They manifested no gratitude for the blessings
they received from his providence, but became vain in their
imaginations, διαλογισμοις, in their reasonings. This certainly refers
to the foolish manner in which even the wisest of their philosophers
discoursed about the Divine nature, not excepting Socrates, Plato, or
Seneca. Who can read their works without being struck with the vanity of
their reasonings, as well as with the stupidity of their nonsense, when
speaking about God? I might crowd my page with proofs of this; but it is
not necessary to those who are acquainted with their writings, and to
others it would not be useful. In short, their foolish, darkened minds
sought God no where but in the place in which he is never to be found;
viz. the vile, corrupted, and corrupting passions of their own hearts.
As they did not discover him there, they scarcely sought him any where
else.

[Romans 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rom 1:22</span></span>

Professing themselves to be wise - This is most strikingly true of all
the ancient philosophers, whether Greeks or Romans, as their works,
which remain, sufficiently testify. The word φασκοντες signifies not
merely the professing but the assumption of the philosophic character.
In this sense the word φασκειν is used by the best Greek writers. See
Kypke. A dispassionate examination of the doctrine and lives of the most
famed philosophers of antiquity, of every nation, will show that they
were darkened in their mind and irregular in their conduct. It was from
the Christian religion alone that true philosophy and genuine
philosophers sprang.

[Romans 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">rom 1:23</span></span>

They changed the glory, etc. - The finest representation of their
deities was in the human figure; and on such representative figures the
sculptors spent all their skill; hence the Hercules of Farnese, the
Venus of Medicis, and the Apollo of Belvidere. And when they had formed
their gods according to the human shape, they endowed them with human
passions; and as they clothed them with attributes of extraordinary
strength, beauty, wisdom, etc., not having the true principles of
morality, they represented them as slaves to the most disorderly and
disgraceful passions; excelling in irregularities the most profligate of
men, as possessing unlimited powers of sensual gratification.

And to birds - As the eagle of Jupiter among the Romans, and the ibis
and hawk among the Egyptians; which were all sacred animals.

Four-footed beasts - As the apis or white ox among the Egyptians; from
which the idolatrous Israelites took their golden calf. The goat, the
monkey, and the dog, were also sacred animals among the same people.

Creeping things - Such as the crocodile and scarabeus, or beetle, among
the Egyptians.

[Romans 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">rom 1:24</span></span>

God - gave them up, etc. - They had filled up the measure of their
iniquities, and God, by permitting them to plunge into all manner of
irregularities, thus, by one species of sin, inflicted punishment on
another.

Dishonour their own bodies - Probably alluding here to what is more
openly expressed, [Rom 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#026.md), [Rom
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#027.md).

Between themselves - εν εαυτοις, Of themselves, of their own free
accord; none inciting, none impelling.

[Romans 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">rom 1:25</span></span>

Changed the truth of God into a lie - In the place of the true worship
of God, they established idolatry. In various places of Scripture idols
are termed lies. [Isa 44:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#020.md); [Jer
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#014.md); [Jer
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#025.md). The true God was known among
the primitive inhabitants of the earth, those who first became idolaters
literally changed the truth of God into a lie: they did know the true
God, but they put idols in his place.

[Romans 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">rom 1:26</span></span>

For this cause God gave them up, etc. - Their system of idolatry
necessarily produced all kinds of impurity. How could it be otherwise,
when the highest objects of their worship were adulterers, fornicators,
and prostitutes of the most infamous kind, such as Jupiter, Apollo,
Mars, Venus, etc.? Of the abominable evils with which the apostle
charges the Gentiles in this and the following verse I could produce a
multitude of proofs from their own writings; but it is needless to make
the subject plainer than the apostle has left it.

[Romans 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">rom 1:27</span></span>

Receiving in themselves that recompense, etc. - Both the women and men,
by their unnatural prostitutions, enervated their bodies, so that
barrenness prevailed, and those disorders which are necessarily
attendant on prostitution and sodomitical practices.

[Romans 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">rom 1:28</span></span>

They did not like to retain God - It would, perhaps, be more literal to
translate ουκ εδοκιμασαν, They Did Not Search to retain God in their
knowledge. They did not examine the evidences before them ([Rom
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#019.md), [Rom
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020).md) of his being and attributes;
therefore God gave them over to a Reprobate mind, εις αδοκιμον νουν, to
an Unsearching or undiscerning mind; for it is the same word in both
places. They did not reflect on the proofs they had of the Divine
nature, and God abandoned them to the operations of a mind incapable of
reflection. How men of such powers and learning, as many of the Greek
and Roman philosophers and poets really were, could reason so
inconsecutively concerning things moral and Divine is truly astonishing.
But here we see the hand of a just and avenging God; they abused their
powers, and God deprived them of the right use of these powers.

[Romans 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">rom 1:29</span></span>

Being filled with all unrighteousness - αδικια, every vice contrary to
justice and righteousness.

Fornication - Πορνειᾳ, all commerce between the sexes out of the bounds
of lawful marriage. Some of the best MSS. omit this reading; and others
have ακαθαρσιᾳ, uncleanness.

Wickedness - Πονηριᾳ, malignity, that which is oppressive to its
possessor and to its object; from πονος, labor, toil, etc.

Covetousness - Πλεονεξιᾳ, from πλειον, more, and ἑξω, I will have; the
intense love or lust of gain; the determination to be rich; the
principle of a dissatisfied and discontented soul.

Maliciousness - Κακιᾳ, malice, ill-will; what is radically and
essentially vicious.

Full of envy - Φθονου, from φθινω, to wither, decay, consume, pine away,
etc.; "pain felt and malignity conceived at the sight of excellence or
happiness in another." A fine personification of this vice is found in
Ovid Metam. lib. ii. ver. 768-781, which I shall here insert, with Mr.
Addison's elegant and nervous translation.

\- Videt intus edentem

Vipereas carnes, vitiorum alimenta suorum

Invidiam: visaque oculos avertit. At illa

Surgit humo pigra: semesarumque relinquit

Corpora serpentum, passuque incedit inerti.

Utgue deam vidit formaque armisque decoram,

Ingemuit: vultumque ima ad suspiria duxit.

Pallor in Ore sedet: macies in Corpore toto:

Nusquam recta acies: livent rubigine dentes:

Pectora felle virent: lingua est suffusa veneno.

Risus abest, nisi quem visi movere dolores:

Nec fruitur somno, vigilacibus excita curis:

Sed videt ingratos, intabescitque videndo

Successus hominum; carpitgue et carpitur una;

Suppliciumque suum est.

\- A poisonous morsel in her teeth she chewed,

And gorged the flesh of vipers for her food.

Minerva loathing, turned away her eye.

The hideous monster, rising heavily,

Came stalking forward with a sullen pace,

And left her mangled offals on the place.

Soon as she saw the goddess gay and bright,

She fetched a groan at such a cheerful sight.

Livid and meagre were her looks, her eye

In foul distorted glances turned awry;

A hoard of gall her inward parts possessed,

And spread a greenness o'er her canker'd breast;

Her teeth were brown with rust, and from her tongue

In dangling drops the stringy poison hung.

She never smiles but when the wretched weep;

Nor lulls her malice with a moment's sleep:

Restless in spite while watchful to destroy,

She pines and sickens at another's joy;

Foe to herself, distressing and distressed,

She bears her own tormentor in her breast.

Murder - Φονου, taking away the life of another by any means; mortal
hatred; for he that hates his brother in his heart is a murderer.

Debate - Εριδος, contention, discord, etc. Of this vile passion the
Greeks made a goddess.

Deceit - Δολου, lying, falsity, prevarication, imposition, etc.; from
δελω, to take with a bait.

Malignity - Κακοηθειας, from κακος, evil, and ηθος, a custom; bad
customs, founded in corrupt sentiment, producing evil habits, supported
by general usage. It is generally interpreted, a malignity of mind,
which leads its possessor to put the worst construction on every action;
ascribing to the best deeds the worst motives.

Whisperers - ψιθυριστος, secret detractors; those who, under pretended
secrecy, carry about accusations against their neighbors, whether true
or false; blasting their reputation by clandestine tittle-tattle. This
word should be joined to the succeeding verse.

The whispering is well expressed by the Greek word Ψιθυριστας,
psithuristas.

[Romans 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">rom 1:30</span></span>

Backbiters - Καταλαλους, from κατα, against, and λαλεω, I speak; those
who speak against others; false accusers, slanderers.

Haters of God - Θεοστυγεις, atheists, contemners of sacred things,
maligners of providence, scorners, etc. All profligate deists are of
this class; and it seems to be the finishing part of a diabolic
character.

Despiteful - Ὑβριστας, from ὑβριζω, to treat with injurious insolence;
stormy, boisterous; abusing both the characters and persons of those
over whom they can have any power.

Proud - Ὑπερηφανους, from ὑπερ, above or over, and φαινω, I show or
shine. They who are continually exalting themselves and depressing
others; magnifying themselves at the expense of their neighbors; and
wishing all men to receive their sayings as oracles.

Boasters - Αλαζονας, from λαζομαι, to assume; self-assuming,
vain-glorious, and arrogant men.

Inventors of evil things - Εφευρετας κακων. Those who have invented
destructive customs, rites, fashions, etc.; such as the different
religious ceremonies among the Greeks and Romans - the orgies of
Bacchus, the mysteries of Ceres, the lupercalia, feasts of the Bona Dea,
etc., etc. Multitudes of which evil things, destructive and abominable
ceremonies, are to be found in every part of the heathen worship.

Disobedient to parents - Though filial affection was certainly more
recommended and cultivated than many other virtues, yet there are many
instances on record of the grossest violation of this great branch of
the law of nature.

[Romans 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">rom 1:31</span></span>

Without understanding - Ασυνετους, from α, negative, and συνετος,
knowing; persons incapable of comprehending what was spoken; destitute
of capacity for spiritual things.

Covenant-breakers - Ασυνθετους, from α, negative, and συντιθημυι, to
make an agreement; persons who could be bound by no oath, because,
properly speaking, they had no God to witness or avenge their
misconduct. As every covenant, or agreement, is made as in the presence
of God, so he that opposes the being and doctrine of God is incapable of
being bound by any covenant; he can give no pledge for his conduct.

Without natural affection - Αστοργους; without that attachment which
nature teaches the young of all animals to have to their mothers, and
the mothers to have for their young. The heathens, in general, have made
no scruple to expose the children they did not think proper to bring up,
and to despatch their parents when they were grown old or past labor.

Implacable - Ασπονδους, from α, negative; and σπονδη, A Libation. It was
customary among all nations to pour out wine as a libation to their
gods, when making a treaty. This was done to appease the angry gods, and
reconcile them to the contracting parties. The word here shows a deadly
enmity; the highest pitch of an unforgiving spirit; in a word, persons
who would not make reconciliation either to God or man.

Unmerciful - Ανελεημονας; those who were incapable, through the
deep-rooted wickedness of their own nature, of showing mercy to an enemy
when brought under their power, or doing any thing for the necessitous,
from the principle of benevolence or commiseration.

[Romans 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">rom 1:32</span></span>

Who, knowing the judgment of God - Δικαιωμα, the grand rule of right
which God has revealed to every man, the knowledge of which he has, less
or more, given to every nation of the world, relative to honouring
parents, taking care of their own offspring, keeping their engagements,
etc., etc. In the worst states of heathenism this great principle has
been acknowledged; but, through the prevalence of corruption in the
heart, this law, though acknowledged, was not obeyed; and the corruption
increased so that those were highest in repute who had cast off all
restraints of this kind; so that they even delighted in them;
συνευδοκουσι, highly applauded, and gladly associated with those
transgressors: which argues the very highest pitch of moral depravity.

1\. The preceding chapter gives us one of the finest views of the Gospel
of Christ, to be met with any where. It is God's method of saving a lost
world, in a way which that world could never have imagined: there is
nothing human in it; it is all truly and gloriously Divine; essentially
necessary to the salvation of man, and fully adequate to the purposes of
its institution. Though it is an extension of the old covenant, yet it
is almost wholly dissimilar; being as different from that as the person
is from the picture which represents it, and as the substance is from
the shadow projected by it. It is a scheme as worthy of God as it is
necessary for man; hence there are no excluding clauses in it - it is
for the Jew and for the Greek; for the wise and for the unwise; for all
the nations of the universe, and for all the individuals of those
nations. He blasphemes God who holds the contrary.

2\. As God never does any thing that is not fitting, suitable, and
necessary to be done, he has not made an unnecessary display of his
mercy and goodness in the incarnation and death of his Son - all this
was necessary, else it had not been done. But how does the necessity
appear? In the deep-rooted and widely extended corruption and profligacy
of the nations of the earth. Of these the apostle gives a most affecting
and distressing picture.

1\. Almost every trace of original righteousness had been obliterated.

2\. The proofs of God's eternal power and providence, so manifest in the
creation and preservation of the universe, were wholly disregarded.

3\. A vain philosophy, without right, principle, or end, was substituted
for those Divine truths which had been discovered originally to man.

4\. Their hearts were contaminated with every vice which could blind the
understanding, pervert the judgment, corrupt the will, and debase the
affections and passions.

5\. This was proved in the most unequivocal manner, by a profligacy of
conduct which had debased them far, far below the beasts that perish;
and the apostle here gives a list of their crimes, every article of
which can be incontrovertibly proved from their own history and their
own writers: crimes which, even bad as the world is now, would shock
common decency to describe. See the whole of the second, third, sixth,
and ninth Satires of Juvenal.

3\. So completely lost were the heathens to a knowledge of the influence
of God on the souls and the necessity of that influence, that they
asserted, in the most positive manner, that man was the author of his
own virtue and wisdom. Cicero, Nat. Deor., lib. iii. c. 36, declares it
a general opinion that, although mankind received from the gods the
outward conveniencies of life - virtutem autem nemo unquam acceptam Deo
retulit - "virtue none ever thought they received from the Deity." And
again: - "This is the persuasion of all, that fortune is to be had from
the gods; wisdom from ourselves." And again: - "Whoever thanked the gods
for his being a good man? Men pray to Jupiter, not that he would make
them just, temperate, and wise; but rich and prosperous."

Juvenal, on this point, speaks thus: -

Monstro, quod ipse tibi possis dare:

Semita certe Tranquillae per virtutem patet unica vitae.

Sat. x. v. 363.

The path to peace is virtue; which, I show,

Thyself may fully on thyself bestow.

In the same stain, Horace, Epist. lib. i. E. xviii. v. penult.

Haec satis est orare Jovem, qui donat et aufert:

Det vitam det opes: aequum mi animum ipse parabo.

To Jove for life and wealth I pray,

These Jove may give or take away;

But, for a firm and tranquil mind,

That blessing for myself I find.

Thus, they became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart
was darkened; and professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.
See Madan's Juvenal, vol. ii. p. 53.

4\. By all this we see what the world was, and what it would have
continued to be had not God sent a Divine revelation of his will, and
established a public ministry to proclaim and enforce it. Were man left
to the power and influence of his fallen nature he would be, in all
places of his dispersion on the earth, what the apostle describes in the
29th, 30th, and 31st verses of this chapter. ([Rom
1:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#029).md) Reader, magnify God, who has
called thee from such deep darkness, to the marvellous light of the
glorious Gospel of his Son; and walk as a child of the light and of the
day, in whom there shall be no cause of stumbling.
