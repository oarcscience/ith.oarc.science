### [Psalms Chapter 67](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 67:0</span></span>

The psalmist prays for the enlargement of God's kingdom, [Psa
67:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#001.md), [Psa
67:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#002.md); calls upon all nations to serve
him, because he judges and governs righteously, [Psa
67:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#003.md); promises prosperity to the
faithful and obedient, [Psa 67:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#006.md), [Psa
67:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#007.md).

The title here is the same with that of [Psa
4:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001) (note.md), where see the notes. It
is supposed to have been written at the return from the Babylonish
captivity, and to foretell the conversion of the Gentiles to the
Christian religion. The prayer for their salvation is very energetic.

[Psalms 67:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 67:1</span></span>

God be merciful unto us - Show the Jewish people thy mercy, bless them
in their bodies and souls and give a full evidence of thy approbation.
This is nearly the same form of blessing as that used [Num
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#025) (note.md), where see the notes.

[Psalms 67:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 67:2</span></span>

That thy way may be known - That thy will, thy gracious designs towards
the children of men, thy way of reconciling them to thyself, of
justifying the ungodly, and sanctifying the unholy, may be known to all
the nations upon the earth! God's way is God's religion; what he walks
in before men; and in which men must walk before him. A man's religion
is his way of worshipping God, and going to heaven. The whole Gospel is
called this way, [Act 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#009.md).

Thy saving health - ישועתך yeshuathecha, "thy salvation." The great work
which is performed in God's way, in destroying the power, pardoning the
guilt, cleansing from the infection, of all sin; and filling the soul
with holiness, with the mind that was in Christ. Let all nations - the
whole Gentile world, know that way, and this salvation!

[Psalms 67:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 67:3</span></span>

Let the people praise thee - When this is done, the people - the
Gentiles, will praise thee; all will give thanks to God for his
unspeakable gift.

[Psalms 67:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 67:4</span></span>

Glad and sing for joy - They shall be made happy in thy salvation. Even
their political state shall be greatly meliorated; for God will be
acknowledged the supreme Judge; their laws shall be founded on his word;
and the nations of the earth shall be governed according to judgment,
justice, and equity.

Selah - This is true. There are innumerable facts to confirm it. All the
nations who have received the Gospel of Christ have been benefited
politically, as well as spiritually, by it.

[Psalms 67:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 67:5</span></span>

Let the people praise thee - Seeing the abundance of the blessings which
the Gentiles were to receive, he calls again and again upon them to
magnify God for such mercies.

[Psalms 67:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 67:6</span></span>

The earth yield her increase - As the ground was cursed for the sin of
man, and the curse was to be removed by Jesus Christ, the fertility of
the ground should be influenced by the preaching of the Gospel; for as
the people's minds would become enlightened by the truth, they would, in
consequence, become capable of making the most beneficial discoveries in
arts and sciences, and there should be an especial blessing on the toil
of the pious husbandman. Whenever true religion prevails, every thing
partakes of its beneficent influence.

[Psalms 67:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 67:7</span></span>

God shall bless us - He shall ever be speaking good to us, and ever
showering down good things upon us.

The last clause of the sixth verse should be joined to the seventh, as
it is in several of the Versions, and should be in all. Many of the
fathers, and several commentators, have thought that there is a
reference to the Holy Trinity in the triple repetition of the word God:
"God, our God, shall bless us; God shall bless us;" thus paraphrased in
the old Psalter: "Blis us God the Fader: and our God the sone: and blis
us and multipli us God the Hali Gast; that swa drede him God, all the
endis of erth; for he wil comme to deme rightwysly that unrightwysly was
demed. He that kan drede him, he eesses noght to lufe him."

When or by whom this Psalm was written cannot be ascertained. It seems
to be simply a prophecy concerning the calling of the Gentiles, the
preaching of the apostles, and the diffusion and influence of
Christianity in the world. It is a fine piece of devotion; and it would
be nearly impossible to read or repeat it with a cold and unaffected
heart.
