### [Hebrews Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md)

Different discoveries made of the Divine will to the ancient Israelites
by the prophets, [Heb 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md). The
discovery now perfected by the revelation of Jesus Christ, of whose
excellences and glories a large description is given, [Heb
1:2-13](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002.md). Angels are ministering spirits
to the heirs of salvation, [Heb 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#014.md).

[Hebrews 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 1:1</span></span>

God, who at sundry times and in divers manners - We can scarcely
conceive any thing more dignified than the opening of this epistle; the
sentiments are exceedingly elevated, and the language, harmony itself!
The infinite God is at once produced to view, not in any of those
attributes which are essential to the Divine nature, but in the
manifestations of his love to the world, by giving a revelation of his
will relative to the salvation of mankind, and thus preparing the way,
through a long train of years, for the introduction of that most
glorious Being, his own Son. This Son, in the fullness of time, was
manifested in the flesh that he might complete all vision and prophecy,
supply all that was wanting to perfect the great scheme of revelation
for the instruction of the world, and then die to put away sin by the
sacrifice of himself. The description which he gives of this glorious
personage is elevated beyond all comparison. Even in his humiliation,
his suffering of death excepted, he is infinitely exalted above all the
angelic host, is the object of their unceasing adoration, is permanent
on his eternal throne at the right hand of the Father, and from him they
all receive their commands to minister to those whom he has redeemed by
his blood. in short, this first chapter, which may be considered the
introduction to the whole epistle is, for importance of subject, dignity
of expression, harmony and energy of language, compression and yet
distinctness of ideas, equal, if not superior, to any other part of the
New Testament.

Sundry times - Πολυμερως, from πολυς, many, and μερος, a part; giving
portions of revelation at different times.

Divers manners - Πολυτροπως, from πολυς, many, and τροπος, a manner,
turn, or form of speech; hence trope, a figure in rhetoric. Lambert Bos
supposes these words to refer to that part of music which is denominated
harmony, viz. that general consent or union of musical sounds which is
made up of different parts; and, understood in this way, it may signify
the agreement or harmony of all the Old Testament writers, who with one
consent gave testimony to Jesus Christ, and the work of redemption by
him. To him gave all the prophets witness, that, through his name,
whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins; [Act
10:43](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#043.md).

But it is better to consider, with Kypke, that the words are rather
intended to point out the imperfect state of Divine revelation under the
Old Testament; it was not complete, nor can it without the New be
considered a sufficiently ample discovery of the Divine will. Under the
Old Testament, revelations were made πολυμερως και πολυτροπως, at
various times, by various persons, in various laws and forms of
teaching, with various degrees of clearness, under various shadows,
types, and figures, and with various modes of revelation, such as by
angels, visions, dreams, mental impressions, etc. See [Num
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#006.md), [Num
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#008.md). But under the New Testament all
is done ἁπλως, simply, by one person, i.e. Jesus, who has fulfilled the
prophets, and completed prophecy; who is the way, the truth, and the
life; and the founder, mediator, and governor of his own kingdom.

One great object of the apostle is, to put the simplicity of the
Christian system in opposition to the complex nature of the Mosaic
economy; and also to show that what the law could not do because it was
weak through the flesh, Jesus has accomplished by the merit of his
death, and the energy of his Spirit.

Maximus Tyrius, Diss. 1, page 7, has a passage where the very words
employed by the apostle are found, and evidently used nearly in the same
sense: Τῃ του ανθρωπου ψυχῃ δυο οργανων οντων προς συνεσιν, του μεν
ἁπλου, ὁν καλουμεν νουν, του δε ποικιλου και πολυμερους και πολυτροπου,
ἁς αισθησεις καλουμεν. "The soul of man has two organs of intelligence:
one simple, which we call mind; the other diversified, and acting in
various modes and various ways, which we term sense."

A similar form of expression the same writer employs in Diss. 15, page
171: "The city which is governed by the mob, πολυφωνον τε ειναι και
πολυμερη και πολυπαθη, is full of noise, and is divided by various
factions and various passions." The excellence of the Gospel above the
law is here set down in three points:

1\. God spake unto the faithful under the Old Testament by Moses and the
prophets, worthy servants, yet servants; now the Son is much better than
a servant, [Heb 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004.md).

2\. Whereas the body of the Old Testament was long in compiling, being
about a thousand years from Moses to Malachi; and God spake unto the
fathers by piecemeal, one while raising up one prophet, another while
another, now sending them one parcel of prophecy or history, then
another; but when Christ came, all was brought to perfection in one age;
the apostles and evangelists were alive, some of them, when every part
of the New Testament was completely finished.

3\. The Old Testament was delivered by God in divers manners, both in
utterance and manifestation; but the delivery of the Gospel was in a
more simple manner; for, although there are various penmen, yet the
subject is the same, and treated with nearly the same phraseology
throughout; James, Jude, and the Apocalypse excepted. See Leigh.

[Hebrews 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 1:2</span></span>

Last days - The Gospel dispensation, called the last days and the last
time, because not to be followed by any other dispensation; or the
conclusion of the Jewish Church and state now at their termination.

By his Son - It is very remarkable that the pronoun αὑτου, his, is not
found in the text; nor is it found in any MS. or version. We should not
therefore supply the pronoun as our translators have done; but simply
read εν Υἱῳ, By a Son, or In a Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all
things. God has many sons and daughters, for he is the Father of the
spirits of all flesh; and he has many heirs, for if sons, then heirs,
heirs of God, and joint heirs with Jesus Christ; but he has no Son who
is heir of all things, none by whom he made the worlds, none in whom he
speaks, and by whom he has delivered a complete revelation to mankind,
but Jesus the Christ.

The apostle begins with the lowest state in which Christ has appeared:

1\. His being a Son, born of a woman, and made under the law. He then
ascends,

2\. So his being an Heir, and an Heir of all things.

3\. He then describes him as the Creator of all worlds.

4\. As the Brightness of the Divine glory.

5\. As the express Image of his person, or character of the Divine
substance.

6\. As sustaining the immense fabric of the universe; and this by the
word of his power.

7\. As having made an atonement for the sin of the world, which was the
most stupendous of all his works.

"'Twas great to speak a world from nought;

'Twas greater to redeem."

8\. As being on the right hand of God, infinitely exalted above all
created beings; and the object of adoration to all the angelic host.

9\. As having an eternal throne, neither his person nor his dignity ever
changing or decaying.

10\. As continuing to exercise dominion, when the earth and the heavens
are no more! It is only in God manifested in the flesh that all these
excellences can possibly appear, therefore the apostle begins this
astonishing climax with the simple Sonship of Christ, or his
incarnation; for, on this, all that he is to man, and all that he has
done for man, is built.

[Hebrews 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 1:3</span></span>

The brightness of his glory - Απαυγασμα της δοξης The resplendent
outbeaming of the essential glory of God. Hesychius interprets απαυγασμα
by ᾑλιου φεγγος, the splendor of the sun. The same form of expression is
used by an apocryphal writer, Wis. 7:26, where, speaking of the
uncreated wisdom of God, he says: "For she is the splendor of eternal
light, απαυγασμα γαρ εστι φωτος αΐδιου, and the unsullied mirror of the
energy of God, and the image of his goodness." The word αυγασμα is that
which has splendor in itself απαυγασμα is the splendor emitted from it;
but the inherent splendor and the exhibited splendor are radically and
essentially the same.

The express image of his person - Χαρακτηρ της ὑποστασεως αυτου· The
character or impression of his hypostasis or substance. It is supposed
that these words expound the former; image expounding brightness, and
person or substance, glory. The hypostasis of God is that which is
essential to him as God; and the character or image is that by which all
the likeness of the original becomes manifest, and is a perfect
fac-simile of the whole. It is a metaphor taken from sealing; the die or
seal leaving the full impression of its every part on the wax to which
it is applied.

From these words it is evident,

1\. That the apostle states Jesus Christ to be of the same essence with
the Father, as the απαυγασμα, or proceeding splendor, must be the same
with the αυγασμα, or inherent splendor.

2\. That Christ, though proceeding from the Father, is of the same
essence; for if one αυγη, or splendor, produce another αυγη, or
splendor, the produced splendor must be of the same essence with that
which produces it.

3\. That although Christ is thus of the same essence with the Father,
yet he is a distinct person from the Father; as the splendor of the sun,
though of the same essence, is distinct from the sun itself, though each
is essential to the other; as the αυγασμα, or inherent splendor, cannot
subsist without its απαυγασμα, or proceeding splendor, nor the
proceeding splendor subsist without the inherent splendor from which it
proceeds.

4\. That Christ is eternal with the Father, as the proceeding splendor
must necessarily be coexistent with the inherent splendor. If the one,
therefore, be uncreated, the other is uncreated; if the one be eternal,
the other is eternal.

Upholding all things by the word of his power - This is an astonishing
description of the infinitely energetic and all pervading power of God.
He spake, and all things were created; he speaks, and all things are
sustained. The Jewish writers frequently express the perfection of the
Divine nature by the phrases, He bears all things, both above and below;
He carries all his creatures; He bears his world; He bears all worlds by
his power. The Hebrews, to whom this epistle was written, would, from
this and other circumstances, fully understand that the apostle believed
Jesus Christ to be truly and properly God.

Purged our sins - There may be here some reference to the great
transactions in the wilderness.

1\. Moses, while in communion with God on the mount, was so impressed
with the Divine glories that his face shone, so that the Israelites
could not behold it. But Jesus is infinitely greater than Moses, for he
is the splendor of God's glory; and,

2\. Moses found the government of the Israelites such a burden that he
altogether sank under it. His words, [Num
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#012.md), are very remarkable: Have I
conceived all this people? Have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say
unto me, Carry them in thy Bosom - unto the land which thou swearest
unto their fathers? But Christ not only carried all the Israelites, and
all mankind; but he upholds All Things by the word of his power.

3\. The Israelites murmured against Moses and against God, and provoked
the heavy displeasure of the Most High; and would have been consumed had
not Aaron made an atonement for them, by offering victims and incense.
But Jesus not only makes an atonement for Israel, but for the whole
world; not with the blood of bulls and goats, but with his own blood:
hence it is said that he purged our sins δι' αὑτου, by himself his own
body and life being the victim. It is very likely that the apostle had
all these things in his eye when he wrote this verse; and takes occasion
from them to show the infinite excellence of Jesus Christ when compared
with Moses; and of his Gospel when compared with the law. And it is very
likely that the Spirit of God, by whom he spoke, kept in view those
maxims of the ancient Jews, concerning the Messiah, whom they represent
as being infinitely greater than Abraham, the patriarchs, Moses, and the
ministering angels. So Rabbi Tanchum, on [Isa
52:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#013.md), Behold my servant shall deal
prudently, says, זה מלך המשיח Zeh melek hammashiach, this is the King
Messiah; and shall be exalted, and be extolled, and be very high. "He
shall be exalted above Abraham, and shall be extolled beyond Moses, and
shall be more sublime than the ministering angels." See the preface.

The right hand of the Majesty on high - As it were associated with the
supreme Majesty, in glory everlasting, and in the government of all
things in time and in eternity; for the right hand is the place of the
greatest eminence, [Kg1 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#019.md). The king
himself, in eastern countries, sits on the throne; the next to him in
the kingdom, and the highest favourite, sits on his right hand; and the
third greatest personage, on his left.

[Hebrews 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 1:4</span></span>

So much better than the angels - Another argument in favor of the
Divinity of our Lord. The Jews had the highest opinion of the
transcendent excellence of angels, they even associate them with God in
the creation of the world, and suppose them to be of the privy council
of the Most High; and thus they understand [Gen
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026.md) : Let us make man in our own
image, in our own likeness; "And the Lord said to the ministering angels
that stood before him, and who were created the second day, Let us make
man," etc. See the Targum of Jonathan ben Uzziel. And they even allow
them to be worshipped for the sake of their Creator, and as his
representatives; though they will not allow them to be worshipped for
their own sake. As, therefore, the Jews considered them next to God, and
none entitled to their adoration but God; on their own ground the
apostle proves Jesus Christ to be God, because God commanded all the
angels of heaven to worship him. He, therefore, who is greater than the
angels, and is the object of their adoration, is God. But Jesus Christ
is greater than the angels, and the object of their adoration; therefore
Jesus Christ must be God.

By inheritance obtained - Κεκληρονομηκεν ονομα. The verb κληρονομειν
signifies generally to participate, possess, obtain, or acquire; and is
so used by the purest Greek writers: Kypke has produced several examples
of it from Demosthenes. It is not by inheritance that Christ possesses a
more excellent name than angels, but as God: he has it naturally and
essentially; and, as God manifested in the flesh, he has it in
consequence of his humiliation, sufferings, and meritorious death. See
[Phi 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009.md).

[Hebrews 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 1:5</span></span>

Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee - These words are quoted
from [Psa 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007.md), a psalm that seems to
refer only to the Messiah; and they are quoted by St. Paul, [Act
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#033.md), as referring to the
resurrection of Christ. And this application of them is confirmed by the
same apostle, [Rom 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004.md), as by his
resurrection from the dead he was declared - manifestly proved, to be
the Son of God with power; God having put forth his miraculous energy in
raising that body from the grave which had truly died, and died a
violent death, for Christ was put to death as a malefactor, but by his
resurrection his innocence was demonstrated, as God could not work a
miracle to raise a wicked man from the dead. As Adam was created by God,
and because no natural generation could have any operation in this case,
therefore he was called the son of God, [Luk
3:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#038.md), and could never have seen
corruption if he had not sinned, so the human nature of Jesus Christ,
formed by the energy of the eternal Spirit in the womb of the virgin,
without any human intervention, was for this very reason called the Son
of God, [Luk 1:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#035.md); and because it had
not sinned, therefore it could not see corruption, nor was it even
mortal, but through a miraculous display of God's infinite love, for the
purpose of making a sacrificial atonement for the sin of the world and
God, having raised this sacrificed human nature from the dead, declared
that same Jesus (who was, as above stated, the Son of God) to be his
Son, the promised Messiah; and as coming by the Virgin Mary, the right
heir to the throne of David, according to the uniform declaration of all
the prophets.

The words, This day have I begotten thee, must refer either to his
incarnation, when he was miraculously conceived in the womb of the
virgin by the power of the Holy Spirit; or to his resurrection from the
dead, when God, by this sovereign display of his almighty energy,
declared him to be his Son, vindicated his innocence, and also the
purity and innocence of the blessed virgin, who was the mother of this
son, and who declared him to be produced in her womb by the power of
God. The resurrection of Christ, therefore, to which the words most
properly refer, not only gave the fullest proof that he was an innocent
and righteous man, but also that he had accomplished the purpose for
which he died, and that his conception was miraculous, and his mother a
pure and unspotted virgin.

This is a subject of infinite importance to the Christian system, and of
the last consequence in reference to the conviction and conversion of
the Jews, for whose use this epistle was sent by God. Here is the rock
on which they split; they deny this Divine Sonship of Jesus Christ, and
their blasphemies against him and his virgin mother are too shocking to
be transcribed. The certainty of the resurrection of Jesus refutes their
every calumny; proves his miraculous conception; vindicates the blessed
virgin; and, in a word, declares him to be the Son of God with power.

This most important use of this saying has passed unnoticed by almost
every Christian writer which I have seen; and yet it lies here at the
foundation of all the apostle's proofs. If Jesus was not thus the Son of
God, the whole Christian system is vain and baseless: but his
resurrection demonstrates him to have been the Son of God; therefore
every thing built on this foundation is more durable than the
foundations of heaven, and as inexpugnable as the throne of the eternal
King.

He shall be to me a Son? - As the Jews have ever blasphemed against the
Sonship of Christ, it was necessary that the apostle should adduce and
make strong all his proofs, and show that this was not a new revelation;
that it was that which was chiefly intended in several scriptures of the
Old Testament, which, without farther mentioning the places where found,
he immediately produces. This place, which is quoted from [Sa2
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#014.md), shows us that the seed which God
promised to David, and who was to sit upon his throne, and whose throne
should be established for ever, was not Solomon, but Jesus Christ; and
indeed he quotes the words so as to intimate that they were so
understood by the Jews. See among the observations at the end of the
chapter.

[Hebrews 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 1:6</span></span>

And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten - This is not a correct
translation of the Greek, Ὁταν δε παλιν εισαγαγῃ τον πρωτοτοκον εις την
οικουμενην· But when he bringeth again, or the second time, the
first-born into the habitable world. This most manifestly refers to his
resurrection, which might be properly considered a second incarnation;
for as the human soul, as well as the fullness of the Godhead bodily,
dwelt in the man, Christ Jesus on and during his incarnation, so when he
expired upon the cross, both the Godhead and the human spirit left his
dead body; and as on his resurrection these were reunited to his
revivified manhood, therefore, with the strictest propriety, does the
apostle say that the resurrection was a second bringing of him into the
world.

I have translated οικουμενη the habitable world, and this is its proper
meaning; and thus it is distinguished from κοσμος, which signifies the
terraqueous globe, independently of its inhabitants; though it often
expresses both the inhabited and uninhabited parts. Our Lord's first
coming into the world is expressed by this latter word, [Heb
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005.md) : Wherefore when he cometh into
the world, διο εισερχομενος εις τον κοσμον, and this simply refers to
his being incarnated, that he might be capable of suffering and dying
for man. But the word is changed on this second coming, I mean his
resurrection, and then οικουμενη is used; and why? (fancy apart) because
he was now to dwell with man; to send his gospel everywhere to all the
inhabitants of the earth, and to accompany that Gospel wherever he sent
it, and to be wherever two or three should be gathered together in his
name. Wherever the messengers of Jesus Christ go, preaching the kingdom
of God, even to the farthest and most desolate parts of the earth where
human beings exist, there they ever find Christ; he is not only in them,
and with them, but he is in and among all who believe on him through
their word.

Let all the angels of God worship him - The apostle recurs here to his
former assertion, that Jesus is higher than the angels, [Heb
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004.md), that he is none of those who can
be called ordinary angels or messengers, but one of the most
extraordinary kind, and the object of worship to all the angels of God.
To worship any creature is idolatry, and God resents idolatry more than
any other evil. Jesus Christ can be no creature, else the angels who
worship him must be guilty of idolatry, and God the author of that
idolatry, who commanded those angels to worship Christ.

There has been some difficulty in ascertaining the place from which the
apostle quotes these words; some suppose [Psa
97:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#007.md) : Worship him, all ye gods; which
the Septuagint translate thus: Προσκυνησατε αυτῳ, παντες αγγελοι αυτου·
Worship him, all ye his angels; but it is not clear that the Messiah is
intended in this psalm, nor are the words precisely those used here by
the apostle. Our marginal references send us with great propriety to the
Septuagint version of [Deu 32:43](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#043.md),
where the passage is found verbatim et literatim; but there is nothing
answering to the words in the present Hebrew text. The apostle
undoubtedly quoted the Septuagint, which had then been for more than 300
years a version of the highest repute among the Jews; and it is very
probable that the copy from which the Seventy translated had the
corresponding words. However this may be, they are now sanctioned by
Divine authority; and as the verse contains some singular additions, I
will set it down in a parallel column with that of our own version,
which was taken immediately from the Hebrew text, premising simply this,
that it is the last verse of the famous prophetic song of Moses, which
seems to point out the advent of the Messiah to discomfit his enemies,
purify the land, and redeem Israel from all his iniquities.

[Deu 32:43](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#043.md), from the Hebrew
Deuteronomy 32:43, from the Septuagint - Rejoice, ye heaven, together
with him; and let all the ... Rejoice, O ye nations, with angels of God
worship him. Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people ... his people; and
let the children of God be strengthened ... for he will avenge in him;
for he will avenge the blood of his children; the blood of his servants;
- and will render he will avenge, and will repay judgment to his adver-
vengeance to his adversaries: - and ... saries; and those who hate him
will he recompense: ... will be merciful to his land and to his people
and the Lord will purge the land of his people

This is a very important verse; and to it, as it stands in the
Septuagint, St. Paul has referred once before; see [Rom
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#010.md). This very verse, as it stands
now in the Septuagint, thus referred to by an inspired writer, shows the
great importance of this ancient version; and proves the necessity of
its being studied and well understood by every minister of Christ. In
Romans 3 there is a large quotation - from [Psa
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md) :, where there are six whole
verses in the apostle's quotation which are not found in the present
Hebrew text, but are preserved in the Septuagint! How strange it is that
this venerable and important version, so often quoted by our Lord and
all his apostles, should be so generally neglected, and so little known!
That the common people should be ignorant of it, is not to be wondered
at, as it has never been put in an English dress; but that the ministers
of the Gospel should be unacquainted with it may be spoken to their
shame.

[Hebrews 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 1:7</span></span>

Who maketh his angels spirits - They are so far from being superior to
Christ, that they are not called God's sons in any peculiar sense, but
his servants, as tempests and lightnings are. In many respects they may
have been made inferior even to man as he came out of the hands of his
Maker, for he was made in the image and likeness of God; but of the
angels, even the highest order of them, this is never spoken. It is very
likely that the apostle refers here to the opinions of the Jews relative
to the angels. In Pirkey R. Elieser, c. 4, it is said: "The angels which
were created the second day, when they minister before God, נעשין של אש
become fire." In Shemoth Rabba, s. 25, fol. 123, it is said: "God is
named the Lord of hosts, because with his angels he doth whatsoever he
wills: when he pleases, he makes them sit down; [Jdg
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#011.md) : And the angel of the Lord came,
and sat under a tree. When he pleases, he causes them to stand; [Isa
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#002.md) : The seraphim stood. Sometimes he
makes them like women; [Zac 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#009.md) :
Behold there came two women, and the wind was in their wings. Sometimes
he makes them like men; [Gen 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#002.md) :
And, lo, three men stood by him. Sometimes he makes them spirits; [Psa
104:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#004.md) : Who maketh his angels spirits.
Sometimes he makes them fire; ibid. His ministers a flame of fire."

In Yalcut Simeoni, par. 2, fol. 11, it is said: "The angel answered
Manoah, I know not in whose image I am made, for God changeth us every
hour: sometimes he makes us fire, sometimes spirit, sometimes men, and
at other times angels." It is very probable that those who are termed
angels are not confined to any specific form or shape, but assume
various forms and appearances according to the nature of the work on
which they are employed and the will of their sovereign employer. This
seems to have been the ancient Jewish doctrine on this subject.

[Hebrews 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 1:8</span></span>

Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever - If this be said of the Son of
God, i.e. Jesus Christ, then Jesus Christ must be God; and indeed the
design of the apostle is to prove this. The words here quoted are taken
from [Psa 45:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#006.md), [Psa
45:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#007.md), which the ancient Chaldee
paraphrast, and the most intelligent rabbins, refer to the Messiah. On
the third verse of this Psalm, Thou art fairer than the children of men,
the Targum says: "Thy beauty, מלכא משיחא malca Meshicha, O King Messiah,
is greater than the children of men." Aben Ezra says: "This Psalm speaks
of David, or rather of his son, the Messiah, for this is his name," [Eze
34:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#024.md) : And David my servant shall be
a Prince over them for ever. Other rabbins confirm this opinion.

This verse is very properly considered a proof, and indeed a strong one,
of the Divinity of Christ; but some late versions of the New Testament
have endeavored to avoid the evidence of this proof by translating the
words thus: God is thy throne for ever and ever; and if this version be
correct, it is certain the text can be no proof of the doctrine. Mr.
Wakefield vindicates this translation at large in his History of
Opinions; and ὁ Θεος, being the nominative case, is supposed to be a
sufficient justification of this version. In answer to this it may be
stated that the nominative case is often used for the vocative,
particularly by the Attics; and the whole scope of the place requires it
should be so used here; and, with due deference to all of a contrary
opinion, the original Hebrew cannot be consistently translated any other
way, כסאך אלהים עולם ועד kisaca Elohim olam vaed, Thy throne, O God, is
for ever, and to eternity. It is in both worlds; and extends over all
time; and will exist through all endless duration. To this our Lord
seems to refer, [Mat 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018.md) : All power
is given unto me, both in Heaven and Earth. My throne, i.e. my dominion,
extends from the creation to the consummation of all things. These I
have made, and these I uphold; and from the end of the world, throughout
eternity, I shall have the same glory - sovereign, unlimited power and
authority, which I had with the Father before the world began; [Joh
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#005.md). I may add that none of the
ancient versions has understood it in the way contended for by those who
deny the Godhead of Christ, either in the Psalm from which it is taken,
or in this place where it is quoted. Aquila translates אלהים Elohim, by
Θεε, O God, in the vocative case; and the Arabic adds the sign of the
vocative ya, reading the place thus: korsee yallaho ila abadilabada, the
same as in our version. And even allowing that ὁ Θεος here is to be used
as the nominative case, it will not make the sense contended for,
without adding εστι to it, a reading which is not countenanced by any
version, nor by any MS. yet discovered. Wiclif, Coverdale, and others,
understood it as the nominative, and translated it so; and yet it is
evident that this nominative has the power of the vocative: forsothe to
the sone God thi troone into the world of world: a gerde of equite the
gerde of thi reume. I give this, pointing and all, as it stands in my
old MS. Bible. Wiclif is nearly the same, but is evidently of a more
modern cast: but to the sone he seith, God thy trone is into the world
of world, a gherd of equyte is the gherd of thi rewme. Coverdale
translates it thus: But unto the sonne he sayeth, God, thi seate
endureth for ever and ever: the cepter of thi kyngdome is a right
cepter. Tindal and others follow in the same way, all reading it in the
nominative case, with the force of the vocative; for none of them has
inserted the word εστι, is, because not authorized by the original: a
word which the opposers of the Divinity of our Lord are obliged to beg,
in order to support their interpretation. See some farther criticisms on
this at the end of this chapter.

A scepter of righteousness - The scepter, which was a sort of staff or
instrument of various forms, was the ensign of government, and is here
used for government itself. This the ancient Jewish writers understand
also of the Messiah.

[Hebrews 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 1:9</span></span>

Thou hast loved righteousness - This is the characteristic of a just
governor: he abhors and suppresses iniquity; he countenances and
supports righteousness and truth.

Therefore God, even thy God - The original, δια τουτο εχρισε σε ὁ Θεος,
ὁ Θεος σου, may be thus translated: Therefore, O God, thy God hath
anointed thee. The form of speech is nearly the same with that in the
preceding verse; but the sense is sufficiently clear if we read,
Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee, etc.

With the oil of gladness - We have often had occasion to remark that,
anciently, kings, priests, and prophets were consecrated to their
several offices by anointing; and that this signified the gifts and
influences of the Divine Spirit. Christ, ὁ Χριστος, signifies The
Anointed One, the same as the Hebrew Messias; and he is here said to be
anointed with the oil of gladness above his fellows. None was ever
constituted prophet, priest, and king, but himself; some were kings
only, prophets only, and priests only; others were kings and priests, or
priests and prophets, or kings and prophets; but none had ever the three
offices in his own person but Jesus Christ, and none but himself can be
a King over the universe, a Prophet to all intelligent beings, and a
Priest to the whole human race. Thus he is infinitely exalted beyond his
fellows - all that had ever borne the regal, prophetic, or sacerdotal
offices.

Some think that the word μετοχους, fellows, refers to believers who are
made partakers of the same Spirit, but cannot have its infinite
plenitude. The first sense seems the best. Gladness is used to express
the festivities which took place on the inauguration of kings, etc.

[Hebrews 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 1:10</span></span>

And, Thou, Lord - This is an address to the Son as the Creator, see [Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002.md); for this is implied in laying the
foundation of the earth. The heavens, which are the work of his hands,
point out his infinite wisdom and skill.

[Hebrews 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 1:11</span></span>

They shall perish - Permanently fixed as they seem to be, a time shall
come when they shall be dissolved, and afterward new heavens and a new
earth be formed, in which righteousness alone shall dwell. See [Pe2
3:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010.md).

Shall wax old as doth a garment - As a garment by long using becomes
unfit to be longer used, so shall all visible things; they shall wear
old, and wear out; and hence the necessity of their being renewed. It is
remarkable that our word world is a contraction of wear old; a term by
which our ancestors expressed the sentiment contained in this verse.
That the word was thus compounded, and that it had this sense in our
language, may be proved from the most competent and indisputable
witnesses. It was formerly written weorold, and wereld. This etymology
is finely alluded to by our excellent poet, Spencer, when describing the
primitive age of innocence, succeeded by the age of depravity: -

"The lion there did with the lambe consort,

And eke the dove sat by the faulcon's side;

Ne each of other feared fraude or tort,

But did in safe security abide,

Withouten perill of the stronger pride:

But when the World woxe old, it woxe warre old,

Whereof it hight, and having shortly tride

The trains of wit, in wickednesse woxe bold,

And dared of all sinnes, the secrets to unfold."

Even the heathen poets are full of such allusions. See Horace, Carm.
lib. iii., od. 6; Virgil, Aen. viii., ver. 324.

Thou remainest - Instead of διαμένεις, some good MSS. read διαμενεῖς,
the first, without the circumflex, being the present tense of the
indicative mood; the latter, with the circumflex, being the future -
thou shalt remain. The difference between these two readings is of
little importance.

[Hebrews 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 1:12</span></span>

And they shall be changed - Not destroyed ultimately, or annihilated.
They shall be changed and renewed.

But thou art the same - These words can be said of no being but God; all
others are changeable or perishable, because temporal; only that which
is eternal can continue essentially, and, speaking after the manner of
men, formally the same.

Thy years shall not fail - There is in the Divine duration no circle to
be run, no space to be measured, no time to be reckoned.

All is eternity - infinite and onward.

[Hebrews 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 1:13</span></span>

But to which of the angels - We have already seen, from the opinions and
concessions of the Jews, that, if Jesus Christ could be proved to be
greater than the angels, it would necessarily follow that he was God:
and this the apostle does most amply prove by these various quotations
from their own Scriptures; for he shows that while he is the supreme and
absolute Sovereign, they are no more than his messengers and servants,
and servants even to his servants, i.e. to mankind.

[Hebrews 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 1:14</span></span>

Are they not all ministering spirits - That is, They are all ministering
spirits; for the Hebrews often express the strongest affirmative by an
interrogation.

All the angels, even those of the highest order, are employed by their
Creator to serve those who believe in Christ Jesus. What these services
are, and how performed, it would be impossible to state. Much has been
written on the subject, partly founded on Scripture, and partly on
conjecture. They are, no doubt, constantly employed in averting evil and
procuring good. If God help man by man, we need not wonder that he helps
man by angels. We know that he needs none of those helps, for he can do
all things himself; yet it seems agreeable to his infinite wisdom and
goodness to use them. This is part of the economy of God in the
government of the world and of the Church; and a part, no doubt,
essential to the harmony and perfection of the whole. The reader may see
a very sensible discourse on this text in vol. ii., page 133, of the
Rev. John Wesley's works, American edition. Dr. Owen treats the subject
at large in his comment on this verse, vol. iii., page 141, edit. 8vo.,
which is just now brought to my hand, and which appears to be a very
learned, judicious, and important work, but by far too diffuse. In it
the words of God are drowned in the sayings of man.

The Godhead of Christ is a subject of such great importance, both to the
faith and hope of a Christian, that I feel it necessary to bring it full
into view, wherever it is referred to in the sacred writings. It is a
prominent article in the apostle's creed, and should be so in ours. That
this doctrine cannot be established on [Heb
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#008.md) has been the assertion of many. To
what I have already said on this verse, I beg leave to subjoin the
following criticisms of a learned friend, who has made this subject his
particular study.
