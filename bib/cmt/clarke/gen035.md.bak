### [Genesis Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 35:0</span></span>

Jacob is commanded of God to go to Beth-el, and to build an altar there,
[Gen 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#001.md). His exhortation to his
family to put away all strange gods, etc., [Gen
35:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#002.md), [Gen
35:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#003.md). They deliver them all up, and
Jacob hides them in the earth, [Gen
35:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#004.md). They commence their journey,
[Gen 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#005.md); come to Luz, [Gen
35:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#006.md); build there the altar
El-beth-el, [Gen 35:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#007.md). Burial place of
Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, [Gen 35:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#008.md).
God appears again unto Jacob, [Gen
35:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#009.md). Blesses him and renews the
promises, [Gen 35:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#010.md). To
commemorate this manifestation of God, Jacob sets up a pillar, and calls
the place Beth-el, [Gen 35:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#014.md), [Gen
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#015.md). They journey to Ephrath, where
Rachel, after hard labor, is delivered of Benjamin, and dies, [Gen
35:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#016.md). Jacob sets up a pillar on
her grave, [Gen 35:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#020.md). They journey to
Edar, [Gen 35:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#021.md). While at this place,
Reuben defiles his father's bed, [Gen
35:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#022.md). Account of the children of
Jacob, according to the mothers, [Gen
35:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#023.md). Jacob comes to Mamre to his
father Isaac, who was probably then in the one hundred and fifty-eighth
year of his age, [Gen 35:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#027.md). Isaac
dies, and is buried by his sons Esau and Jacob, [Gen
35:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#029.md).

[Genesis 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 35:1</span></span>

Arise, go up to Beth-el - The transaction that had lately taken place
rendered it unsafe for Jacob to dwell any longer at the city of Shechem;
and it seems that while he was reflecting on the horrible act of Simeon
and Levi, and not knowing what to do, God graciously appeared to him,
and commanded him to go up to Beth-el, build an altar there, and thus
perform the vow he had made, [Gen
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#020.md), [Gen
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#022.md).

[Genesis 35:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 35:2</span></span>

Put away the strange gods - אלהי הנכר elohey hannechar, the gods of the
foreigners, which were among them. Jacob's servants were all Syrians,
and no doubt were addicted less or more to idolatry and superstition.
These gods might belong to them, or, as some have conjectured, they were
the teraphim which Rachel stole; but these have already been supposed to
be astrological tables, or something of this kind, called by Laban his
gods, because by them he supposed he could predict future events, and
that they referred to certain astral and planetary intelligences, by
whose influences sublunary things were regulated. But it is more natural
to suppose that these gods found now in Jacob's family were images of
silver, gold, or curious workmanship, which were found among the spoils
of the city of Shechem. Lest these should become incitements to
idolatry, Jacob orders them to be put away.

Be clean, and change your garments - Personal or outward purification,
as emblematical of the sanctification of the soul, has been in use among
all the true worshippers of God from the beginning of the world. In many
cases the law of Moses more solemnly enjoined rites and ceremonies which
had been in use from the earliest ages. "A Hindoo considers those
clothes defiled in which he has been employed in business, and always
changes them before eating and worship." - Ward.

[Genesis 35:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 35:3</span></span>

Answered me in the day of my distress - Not only when he fled from the
face of his brother, but more particularly when he was in his greatest
strait at the brook of Jabbok.

[Genesis 35:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 35:4</span></span>

And - ear-rings which were in their ears - Whether these rings were in
the ears of the gods, or in those of Jacob's family, we may rest assured
that they were not mere ornaments, but served for superstitious
purposes. Ear-rings were certainly worn as amulets and charms, first
consecrated to some god, or formed under some constellation, on which
magical characters and images were drawn. A very ancient and beautiful
one of this kind brought from Egypt, cut out of a solid piece of
cornelian, now lies before me. It was evidently intended for the ear, as
the opening is too small for any human finger; and it is engraved all
over with strange characters and images, which prove that it was
intended for a talisman or amulet. It seems to be such a one as St.
Augustine describes, Epist. 73, which was suspended from the tip of the
ears both of men and women, not for the purpose of ornament, but through
an execrable superstition, for the service of demons. "Execranda
superstitio ligaturarum, in quibus etiam inaures virorum in summis ex
una parte auriculis suspensae deputantur, non ad placendum hominibus,
sed ad serviendum daemonibus." See Clarke on [Gen
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#022) (note.md).

[Genesis 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 35:5</span></span>

The terror of God - A supernatural awe sent by the Almighty, was upon
the cities that were round about, so that they were not molested in
their departure. This could be owing to nothing less than the especial
providence of God.

[Genesis 35:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 35:7</span></span>

El-beth-el - אל בית אל the strong God, the house of the strong God. But
the first אל el is wanting in one of De Rossi's MSS., as it is also in
the Septuagint, Vulgate, Syriac, and some copies of the Arabic. The
sentence reads much better without it, and much more consistent with the
parallel passages.

[Genesis 35:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 35:8</span></span>

But Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died - She was sent with Rebekah when
taken by Abraham's servant to be wife to Isaac, [Gen
24:59](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#059.md). How she came to be in Jacob's
family, expositors are greatly puzzled to find out; but the text does
not state that she was in Jacob's family. Her death is mentioned merely
because Jacob and his family had now arrived at the place where she was
buried, and the name of that place was called Allon-bachuth, "the oak of
weeping," as it is likely her death had been greatly regretted, and a
general and extraordinary mourning had taken place on the occasion. Of
Rebekah's death we know nothing. After her counsel to her son, [Gen
27:5-17](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#005.md), [Gen
27:42-46](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#042.md), we hear no more of her
history from the sacred writings, except of her burial in [Gen
49:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#031.md). Her name is written in the
dust. And is not this designed as a mark of the disapprobation of God?
It seems strange that such an inconsiderable person as a nurse should be
mentioned, when even the person she brought up is passed by unnoticed!
It has been observed that the nurse of Aeneas is mentioned nearly in the
same way by the poet Virgil; and in the circumstances, in both cases,
there is a striking resemblance.

"Tu quoque littoribus nostris,

Aeneia nutrix, Aeternam moriens famam,

Caleta, dedisti:

Eet nunc servat honos sedem tunus; ossaque nomen,

Hesperia in magna, (si qua est en gloria), signat.

At pius exequils Aeneas rite solutis,

Aggere composito tumuli, postquam alta quierunt

Aequora, tendit iter veils, portumque relinqult."

Aen., lib. vii., ver. 1, etc.

"Thou too, Cajeta, whose indulgent cares

Nursed the great chief, and form'd his tender years,

Expiring here (an ever-honor'd name!)

Adorn Hesperia with immortal fame:

Thy name survives, to please thy pensive ghost;

Thy sacred relics grace the Latian coast.

Soon as her funeral rites the prince had paid,

And raised a tomb in honor of the dead;

The sea subsiding, and the tempests o'er,

He spreads the flying sails, and leaves the shore."

Pitt.

[Genesis 35:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 35:9</span></span>

God appeared unto Jacob again - He appeared to him first at Shechem,
when he commanded him to go to Bethel, and now that he is arrived at the
place, God appears to him the second time, and confirms to him the
Abrahamic blessing. To Isaac and Jacob these frequent appearances of God
were necessary, but they were not so to Abraham; for to him one word was
sufficient - Abraham believed God.

[Genesis 35:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 35:13</span></span>

And God went up from him - This was not a vision, nor a strong mental
impression, but a real manifestation of God. Jacob saw and heard him
speak, and before his eyes he went up - ascended to heaven. This was no
doubt the future Savior, the Angel of the covenant. See [Gen
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#007.md).

[Genesis 35:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 35:14</span></span>

A drink-offering - נסך nesech, a libation. These were afterwards very
common in all countries. At first they consisted probably of water only,
afterwards wine was used; see on [Lev
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#001) (note.md), etc. The pillar which
Jacob set up was to commemorate the appearance of God to him; the
drink-offering and the oil were intended to express his gratitude and
devotion to his preserver. It was probably the same pillar which he had
set up before, which had since been thrown down, and which he had
consecrated afresh to God.

[Genesis 35:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 35:16</span></span>

There was but a little way to come to Ephrath - The word כברת kibrath,
translated here a little way, has greatly perplexed commentators. It
occurs only here, in [Gen 48:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#007.md), and
[Kg2 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#019.md); and it seems to have been
some sort of measure applied to land, as we say a mile, an acre, a rood,
a perch; but what the exact quantity of the kibrath was cannot be
ascertained. Ephrath, called also Bethlehem, and Bethlehem Ephrata, was
the birthplace of our blessed Redeemer. See its meaning [Mat
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#006) (note.md).

[Genesis 35:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 35:18</span></span>

As her soul was in departing - Is not this a proof that there is an
immortal spirit in man, which can exist separate from and independent of
the body? Of Rachel's death it is said, בצאת נפשה betseth naphshah, in
the going away of her soul; her body did not go away, therefore her soul
and body must have been distinct. If her breath only had been in tended,
נשמה neshamah or רוח ruach would have rather been used, as the first
means breath, the latter breath or spirit indifferently.

She called his name Ben-oni - בן אני the Son of my sorrow or affliction,
because of the hard labor she had in bringing him into the world; but
his father called him Benjamin, בנימין the son of my right hand, i.e.,
the son peculiarly dear to me. So man of the right hand, [Psa
80:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#017.md), signifies one much loved and
regarded of God. The Samaritan has Benyamin, the son of days; i.e., the
son of his old age, as Judah calls him, [Gen
44:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#020.md); and Houbigant contends that
this is the true reading, and that the Chaldee termination in for im is
a corruption. If it be a corruption, it is as old as the days of St.
Jerome, who translated the place Benjamin, id est, filius dextrae;
Benjamin, that is, the son of the right hand.

[Genesis 35:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 35:20</span></span>

Jacob set a pillar upon her grave - Was not this the origin of funeral
monuments? In ancient times, and among rude nations, a heap of stones
designated the burial place of the chief; many of these still remain in
different countries. Afterwards a rude stone, with a simple inscription,
was used, containing only the name of the deceased, and that of his
father. But where arts and sciences flourished, superb monuments were
erected highly decorated, and pompously inscribed. It is very likely
from the circumstances of Jacob that a single stone constituted the
pillar in this case, on which, if writing did then exist, the name, or
rather some hieroglyphical device, was probably inscribed. That which is
now called Rachel's pillar is allowed, by those who have examined it, to
be a comparatively modern structure.

[Genesis 35:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 35:21</span></span>

Tower of Edar - Literally, the tower of the flock, and so translated
[Mic 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#008.md). It is supposed that this
tower was about a mile from Bethlehem, and to have been the place where
the angels appeared to the shepherds. The Targum of Jonathan expressly
says: "It is the place in which the King Messiah shall be manifested in
the end of days." By the tower of the flock we may understand a place
built by the shepherds near to some well, for the convenience of
watering their flocks, and keeping watch over them by night.

[Genesis 35:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 35:22</span></span>

Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine - Jonathan, in
his Targum, says that Reuben only overthrew the bed of Bilhah, which was
set up opposite to the bed of his mother Leah, and that this was reputed
to him as if he had lain with her. The colouring given to the passage by
the Targumist is, that Reuben was incensed, because he found Bilhah
preferred after the death of Rachel to his own mother Leah; and
therefore in his anger he overthrew her couch. The same sentiment is
repeated by Jonathan, and glanced at by the Jerusalem Targum, [Gen
49:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#004.md). Could this view of the subject
be proved to be correct, both piety and candour would rejoice.

And Israel heard it - Not one word is added farther in the Hebrew text;
but a break is left in the verse, opposite to which there is a Masoretic
note, which simply states that there is a hiatus in the verse. This
hiatus the Septuagint has thus supplied: και πονηρον εφανη εναντιον
αυτον, and it appeared evil in his sight.

Now the sons of Jacob were twelve - Called afterwards the twelve
patriarchs, because they became heads or chiefs of numerous families or
tribes, [Act 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#008.md); and the people that
descended from them are called the twelve tribes, [Act
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#007.md); [Jam
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#001.md). Twelve princes came from Ishmael,
[Gen 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#016.md), who were heads of families
and tribes. And in reference to the twelve patriarchs, our Lord chose
twelve apostles. Strictly speaking, there were thirteen tribes among the
Hebrews, as Ephraim and Manasses were counted for tribes, [Gen
48:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#005.md), [Gen
48:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#006.md); but the Scripture in naming
them, says Mr. Ainsworth, usually sets down but twelve, omitting the
name now of one, then of another, as may in sundry places be observed,
Deuteronomy 33; Ezekiel 48; Revelation 12, etc.

[Genesis 35:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">gen 35:23</span></span>

The sons of Leah - The children are arranged under their respective
mothers, and not in order of their birth.

[Genesis 35:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gen 35:26</span></span>

Born to him in Padan-aram - i.e., all but Benjamin was born in Canaan,
[Gen 35:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#016.md), [Gen
35:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#017.md).

It is well known that Padan-aram is the same as Mesopotamia, and hence
the Septuagint translate Μεσοποταμια της Συριας, Mesopotamia of Syria.
The word signifies between the two rivers, from μεσος the midst, and
ποταμος, a river. It is situated between the Euphrates and Tigris,
having Assyria on the east, Arabia Deserta, with Babylonia, on the
south, Syria on the west, and Armenia on the north. It is now the
province of Diarbek, in Asiatic Turkey, and is sometimes called
Maverannahar, the country beyond the river; and Aram Naharaim, Aram or
Syria of the two rivers.

[Genesis 35:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">gen 35:27</span></span>

The city of Arbah, (which is Hebron) - See [Gen
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#002.md). It has been conjectured that
Jacob must have paid a visit to his father before this time, as
previously to this he had been some years in Canaan; but now, as he was
approaching to his end, Jacob is supposed to have gone to live with and
comfort him in his declining days.

[Genesis 35:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 35:29</span></span>

Isaac gave up the ghost - and was gathered unto his people - See Clarke
on [Gen 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#008) (note.md).

Esau and Jacob buried him - See [Gen
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#009.md). Esau, as we have seen Genesis
33, was thoroughly reconciled to his brother Jacob, and now they both
join in fraternal and filial affection to do the last kind office to
their amiable father. It is generally allowed that the death of Isaac is
mentioned here out of its chronological order, as several of the
transactions mentioned in the succeeding chapters, especially 37 and 38,
must have happened during his life; but that the history of Joseph might
not be disturbed, his death is anticipated in this place. It is supposed
that he lived at least twelve years after Joseph was sold into Egypt.

This chapter contains several subjects which are well worthy of the
reader's most serious attention.

1\. That such a family as that of Jacob should have had false gods in
it, is a matter not less astonishing than real: and suppose that we
allow, as is very probable, that their images and rings were got from
strangers, the Syrians and the Shechemites, yet their being tolerated in
the family, though it is probable this was for a very short time, cannot
be easily accounted for. It is true the Law was not then given, and the
unity of God not so particularly taught as it was afterwards. Besides,
we have already seen that certain superstitions were compatible in those
early times with general sincerity and attachment to the truth; those
times and acts of ignorance were winked at, till superior light shone
upon the world. Between many of the practices of Laban's family and
those of the surrounding heathenish tribes, there might have been but
little difference; and this was probably the reason why Dinah could so
readily mix with the daughters of the land, [Gen
34:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#001.md), which led to the fatal
consequences already reviewed. Sin is like the letting out of water -
when once a breach is made in the dyke, the stream becomes determined to
a wrong course, and its progress is soon irresistible. Had not Jacob put
away these strange gods, the whole family might have been infected with
idolatry. This saying of one of the ancients is good, Vitia transmittit
ad posteros, qui praesentibus culpis ignoscit - Seneca. "He who is
indulgent to present offenses, transmits sin to posterity." The first
motions of it should be firmly resisted; after struggles are too often
fruitless.

2\. The doctrine of a particular and especial providence has another
proof in this chapter. After the sanguinary conduct of Jacob's sons, is
it not surprising that the neighboring tribes did not join together and
extirpate the whole family? And so they certainly would, had not the
terror of God fallen upon them, [Gen
35:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#005.md). Jacob and the major part of his
family were innocent of this great transgression; and on the
preservation of their lives, the accomplishment of great events
depended: therefore God watches over them, and shields them from the
hands of their enemies.

3\. The impatience and fate of the amiable Rachel, who can read of
without deploring? Give me children, said she, or else I die, [Gen
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#001.md). Her desire was granted, and her
death was the consequence! God's way is ever best. We know not what we
ask, nor what we ought to ask, and therefore often ask amiss when we
petition for such secular things as belong to the dispensations of God's
providence. For things of this kind we have no revealed directory; and
when we ask for them, it should be with the deepest submission to the
Divine will, as God alone knows what is best for us. With respect to the
soul, every thing is clearly revealed, so that we may ask and receive,
and have a fullness of joy; but as to our bodies, there is much reason
to fear that the answer of our petitions would be, in numerous cases,
our inevitable destruction. How many prayers does God in mercy shut out!

4\. The transgression of Reuben, of whatsoever kind, was marked, not
only by the displeasure of his father, but by that of God also; see [Gen
49:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#004.md). It brought a curse upon him, and
he forfeited thereby the right of primogeniture and the priesthood: the
first was given to Judah, the second to Levi. Is it not in reference to
this that our Lord addresses these solemn words to the angel of the
Church of Philadelphia: Behold, I come quickly; hold that fast which
thou hast, that No Man Take Thy Crown? A man, by sowing a grain of
forbidden sweets, may reap an abundant harvest of eternal wretchedness.
Reader, let not sin rob thee of the kingdom of God.

5\. Here we have the death of Isaac recorded: most that can be said of
his character has been already anticipated, see Genesis 22, etc. He
appears to have been generally pious, deeply submissive and obedient. He
was rather an amiable and good, than a great and useful, man. If
compared with his son Jacob, in the early part of their lives, he
appears to great advantage, as possessing more sincerity and more
personal piety. But if compared with his father Abraham, O, what a
falling off is here! Abraham is the most perfect character under the Old
Testament, and even under the New he has no parallel but St. Paul.
Isaac, though falling far short of his father's excellences, will ever
remain a pattern of piety and filial obedience.
