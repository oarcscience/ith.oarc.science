### [Esther Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#001)

[Esther](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">est 7:0</span></span>

The king at the banquet urges Esther to prefer her petition, with the
positive assurance that it shall be granted, [Est
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#001), [Est
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#002). She petitions for her own life,
and the life of her people, who were sold to be destroyed, [Est
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#003), [Est
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#004). The king inquires the author of
this project, and Haman is accused by the queen, [Est
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#005), [Est
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#006). The king is enraged: Haman
supplicates for his life; but the king orders him to be hanged on the
gallows he had prepared for Mordecai, [Est
7:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#007).

[Esther 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">est 7:2</span></span>

At the banquet of wine - Postquam vino incaluerat, after he had been
heated with wine, says the Vulgate. In such a state the king was more
likely to come into the measures of the queen.

[Esther 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">est 7:3</span></span>

Let my life be given me - This was very artfully, as well as very
honestly, managed; and was highly calculated to work on the feelings of
the king. What! is the life of the queen, whom I most tenderly love, in
any kind of danger?

[Esther 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">est 7:4</span></span>

To be destroyed, to be slain - She here repeats the words which Haman
put into the decree. See [Est 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#013).

Could not countervail the king's damage - Even the ten thousand talents
of silver could not be considered as a compensation to the state for the
loss of a whole nation of people throughout all their generations.

[Esther 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">est 7:5</span></span>

Who is he, and where is he - There is a wonderful abruptness and
confusion in the original words, highly expressive of the state of mind
in which the king then was: מי הוא זה ואי זה הוא אשר מלאו לבו לעשות כן
mi hu zeh veey zeh hu asher melao libbo laasoth ken.

"Who? He? This one? And where? This one? He? Who hath filled his heart
to do thus?" He was at once struck with the horrible nature of a
conspiracy so cruel and diabolic.

[Esther 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">est 7:7</span></span>

Haman stood up - He rose from the table to make request for his life, as
soon as the king had gone out; and then he fell on his knees before the
queen, she still sitting upon her couch.

[Esther 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">est 7:8</span></span>

Will he force the queen - On the king's return he found him at the
queen's knees; and, professing to think that he intended to do violence
to her honor, used the above expressions; though he must have known
that, in such circumstances, the thought of perpetrating an act of this
kind could not possibly exist.

They covered Haman's face - This was a sign of his being devoted to
death: for the attendants saw that the king was determined on his
destruction. When a criminal was condemned by a Roman judge, he was
delivered into the hands of the serjeant with these words: I, lictor;
caput obnubito, arbori infelici suspendito. "Go, serjeant; cover his
head, and hang him on the accursed tree."

[Esther 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">est 7:9</span></span>

Behold also, the gallows - As if he had said, Besides all he has
determined to do to the Jews, he has erected a very high gallows, on
which he had determined, this very day, to hang Mordecai, who has saved
the king's life.

Hang him thereon - Let him be instantly impaled on the same post. "Harm
watch, harm catch," says the proverb. Perillus was the first person
burnt alive in the brazen bull which he had made for the punishment of
others; hence the poet said: -

\- Nec lex est justior ulla, Quam necis artifices arte perire sua.

"Nor can there be a juster law than that the artificers of death should
perish by their own invention."
