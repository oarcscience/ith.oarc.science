### [Deuteronomy Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 19:0</span></span>

Three cities of refuge to be appointed in the midst of the promised
land; the land being divided into three parts, a city is to be placed in
each, a proper way to which is to be prepared, [Deu
19:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#001). In what cases of manslaughter
the benefit of those cities may be claimed, [Deu
19:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#004). Three cities more to be added
should the Lord enlarge their coasts, and the reasons why, [Deu
19:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#007). The intentional murderer
shall have no benefit from these cities, [Deu
19:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#011). The landmark is not to be
shifted, [Deu 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#014). One witness shall
not be deemed sufficient to convict a man, [Deu
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#015). How a false witness shall be
dealt with - he shall bear the punishment which he designed should have
been inflicted on his neighbor, [Deu
19:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#016). Another command to establish
the lex talionis, [Deu 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#021).

[Deuteronomy 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 19:2</span></span>

Thou shalt separate three cities - See on [Num
35:11](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#011) (note), etc.

[Deuteronomy 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 19:3</span></span>

Thou shalt prepare thee a way - The Jews inform us that the roads to the
cities of refuge were made very broad, thirty-two cubits; and even, so
that there should be no impediments in the way; and were constantly kept
in good repair.

[Deuteronomy 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 19:9</span></span>

Shalt thou add three cities more - This was afterwards found necessary,
and accordingly six cities were appointed, three on either side Jordan.
See [Jos 21:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#001), etc. In imitation of
these cities of refuge the heathens had their asyla, and the Catholics
their privileged altars. See [Exo
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#013) (note), [Exo
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#014) (note), and [Num
35:11](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#011) (note), etc.

[Deuteronomy 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 19:11</span></span>

If any man hate his neighbor - See on [Exo
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#013) (note).

[Deuteronomy 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 19:14</span></span>

Thou shalt not remove thy neighbor's landmark - Before the extensive use
of fences, landed property was marked out by stones or posts, set up so
as to ascertain the divisions of family estates. It was easy to remove
one of these landmarks, and set it in a different place; and thus the
dishonest man enlarged his own estate by contracting that of his
neighbor. The termini or landmarks among the Romans were held very
sacred, and were at last deified.

To these termini Numa Pompillus commanded offerings of broth, cakes, and
firstfruits, to be made. And Ovid informs us that it was customary to
sacrifice a lamb to them, and sprinkle them with its blood: -

Spargitur et caeso communis terminus agno.

Fast. lib. ii., ver. 655.

And from Tibullus it appears that they sometimes adorned them with
flowers and garlands: -

Nam veneror, seu stipes habet desertus inagris,

Seu vetus in trivio florida serta lap is.

Eleg. lib. i., E. i., ver. 11.

"Revere each antique stone bedeck'd with flowers,

That bounds the field, or points the doubtful way."

Grainger.

It appears from Juvenal that annual oblations were made to them: -

\- Convallem ruris aviti

Improbus, aut campum mihi si vicinus ademit,

Aut sacrum effodit medio de limite saxum,

Quod mea cum vetulo colult puls annua libo.

Sat. xvi., ver. 36.

"If any rogue vexatious suits advance

Against me for my known inheritance,

Enter by violence my fruitful grounds,

Or take the sacred landmark from my bounds,

Those bounds which, with procession and with prayer

And offer'd cakes, have been my annual care."

Dryden.

In the digests there is a vague law, de termino moto, Digestor. lib.
xlvii., Tit. 21, on which Calmet remarks that though the Romans had no
determined punishment for those who removed the ancient landmarks; yet
if slaves were found to have done it with an evil design, they were put
to death; that persons of quality were sometimes exiled when found
guilty; and that others were sentenced to pecuniary fines, or corporal
punishment.

[Deuteronomy 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 19:15</span></span>

One witness shall not rise up, etc. - See [Num
35:30](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#030) (note).

[Deuteronomy 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 19:19</span></span>

Then shall ye do unto him as he had thought to have done unto his
brother - Nothing can be more equitable or proper than this, that if a
man endeavor to do any injury to or take away the life of another, on
detection he shall be caused to undergo the same evil which he intended
for his innocent neighbor.

Some of our excellent English laws have been made on this very ground.
In the 37th of Edw. III., chap. 18, it is ordained that all those who
make suggestion shall incur the same pain which the other should have
had, if he were attainted, in case his suggestions be found evil. A
similar law was made in the 38th of the same reign, chap. 9. By a law of
the twelve Tables, a false witness was thrown down the Tarpeian rock. In
short, false witnesses have been execrated by all nations.

[Deuteronomy 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">deu 19:21</span></span>

Life - for life, eye for eye, etc. - The operation of such a law as this
must have been very salutary: if a man prized his own members, he would
naturally avoid injuring those of others. It is a pity that this law
were not still in force: it would certainly prevent many of those savage
acts which now both disgrace and injure society. I speak this in
reference to law generally, and the provision that should be made to
prevent and punish ferocious and malevolent offenses. A Christian may
always act on the plan of forgiving injuries; and where the public peace
and safety may not be affected, he should do so; but if law did not make
a provision for the safety of the community by enactment against the
profligate, civil society would soon be destroyed.
