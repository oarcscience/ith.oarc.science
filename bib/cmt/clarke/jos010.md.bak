### [Joshua Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#001.md)

[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jos 10:0</span></span>

Adoni-zedec, king of Jerusalem, hearing of the capture of Ai, and that
the Gibeonites had made peace with Israel, calls to his assistance four
other kings to fight against Gibeon, [Jos
10:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#001.md). They join forces, and encamp
against Gibeon, [Jos 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#005.md). The
Gibeonites send to Joshua for succor, [Jos
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#006.md), who immediately marches to their
relief, receives encouragement from God, and falls suddenly on the
confederate forces, [Jos 10:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#007.md), and
defeats them; they fly, and multitudes of them are slain by a miraculous
shower of hail-stones, [Jos 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#010.md),
[Jos 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#011.md). Joshua, finding that the
day began to fail, prayed that the sun and moon might stand still, that
they might have time to pursue and utterly destroy these confederate
forces, [Jos 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#012.md). The sun and moon
stand still, and make that day as long as two, [Jos
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#013.md), [Jos
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#014.md). Joshua and the people return to
their camp at Gilgal, [Jos 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#015.md). The
five kings having taken shelter in a cave at Makkedah, Joshua commanded
the people to roll great stones against the mouth of the cave, and set a
watch to keep it, while Israel were pursuing their enemies, [Jos
10:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#016.md). The Israelites return to
Makkedah, bring forth the five kings, then slay and hang them on five
trees, [Jos 10:20-27](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#020.md). The Israelites
take and destroy Makkedah, [Jos 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#028.md),
and Libnah, [Jos 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#029.md), [Jos
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#030.md), and Lachish, [Jos
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#031.md), [Jos
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#032.md), and defeat Horam king of Gezer,
[Jos 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#033.md), and take Eglon, [Jos
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#034.md), [Jos
10:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#035.md), and Hebron, [Jos
10:36](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#036.md), [Jos
10:37](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#037.md), and Debir, [Jos
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#038.md), [Jos
10:39](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#039.md), and all the country of the
hills, south, vale, and springs, and the whole country from
Kadesh-Barnea to Gibeon, [Jos
10:40-42](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#040.md). They return to Gilgal, [Jos
10:43](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#043.md).

[Joshua 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 10:1</span></span>

Adoni-zedec - This name signifies the Lord of justice or righteousness;
and it has been conjectured that the Canaanitish kings assumed this name
in imitation of that of the ancient patriarchal king of this city,
Melchizedek, whose name signifies king of righteousness, or my righteous
king: a supposition that is not improbable, when the celebrity of
Melchizedek is considered.

Jerusalem - ירושלם Yerushalam. This word has been variously explained;
if it be compounded of שלם shalam, peace, perfection, etc., and ראה
raah, he saw, it may signify the vision of peace - or, he shall see
peace or perfection.

[Joshua 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 10:2</span></span>

As one of the royal cities - Not a regal city, but great, well inhabited
and well fortified, as those cities which served for the royal residence
generally were. It does not appear that the Gibeonites had any king -
they seem to have been a small but powerful republic, all the men
thereof were mighty, merely governed by their elders: for in their
address to Joshua, [Jos 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#011.md), they
mention no king, but simply state that they were sent by their elders
and the inhabitants of their country; nor do we any where read of their
king; and therefore we may naturally suppose that they had none.

[Joshua 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 10:3</span></span>

Hoham king of Hebron - This city was situated in the mountains,
southward of Jerusalem, from which it was about thirty miles distant. It
fell to the tribe of Judah.

Piram king of Jarmuth - There were two cities of this name; one belonged
to the tribe of Issachar, see [Jos
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#029.md); that mentioned here fell to the
tribe of Judah, see [Jos 15:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#035.md); it is
supposed to have been about eighteen miles distant from Jerusalem.

Japhia king of Lachish - This city is celebrated in Scripture; in that
city Amaziah was slain by conspirators, [Kg2
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#019.md). It was besieged by Sennacherib,
[Kg2 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#014.md), [Kg2
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#017.md); and without effect by the king
of Assyria, as we learn from [Isa 37:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#008.md)
: it was also besieged by the army of Nebuchadnezzar, see [Jer
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#007.md); it also fell to the lot of
Judah, [Jos 15:39](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#039.md).

Debir king of Eglon - Where this city was situated is very uncertain;
but we learn from [Jos 15:39](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#039.md), that it
fell to the lot of the tribe of Judah.

[Joshua 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 10:5</span></span>

The five kings of the Amorites - This is a general name for the
inhabitants of Canaan, otherwise called Canaanites; and it is very
likely that they had this appellation because the Amorites were the most
powerful tribe or nation in that country. The inhabitants of Jerusalem
were Jebusites, [Jos 15:63](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#063.md); those of
Hebron were Hittites, [Gen 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#002.md), [Gen
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#003.md); [Gen
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#009.md), [Gen
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#010.md); and the Gibeonites were
Hivites, [Jos 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#007.md); and yet all these
are called Amorites occasionally, probably for the reason already
mentioned, viz., because that tribe was most numerous and powerful.

[Joshua 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 10:9</span></span>

Joshua - came unto them suddenly - This he did by a forced march during
the night, for he went up from Gilgal all night; from Gilgal to Gibeon
was about eighteen or twenty miles; and, having fallen so unexpectedly
on these confederate kings, they were immediately thrown into confusion.

[Joshua 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 10:10</span></span>

Slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon - Multitudes of them fell in
the onset; after which they fled, and the Israelites pursued them by the
way of Beth-horon. There were two cities of this name, the upper and
lower, both in the tribe of Ephraim, and built by Sherah, the daughter
of Ephraim, [Ch1 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#024.md). The situation
of these two cities is not exactly known.

To Azekah, and unto Makkedah - These two cities were in the tribe of
Judah, [Jos 15:35-41](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#035.md).

[Joshua 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jos 10:11</span></span>

The Lord cast down great stones from heaven upon them - Some have
contended that stones, in the common acceptation of the word, are
intended here; and that the term hail-stones is only used to point out
the celerity of their fall, and their quantity. That stones have fallen
from the clouds, if not from a greater height, is a most incontestable
fact. That these have fallen in different parts of the world is also
true; the East Indies, America, France, Germany, England, Ireland, etc.,
have all witnessed this phenomenon: of such stones I possess and have
seen several fragments; some considerable pieces may be seen in the
British Museum. That God might have cast down such stones as these on
the Canaanites, there can be no doubt, because his power is unlimited;
and the whole account proves that here there was a miraculous
interference. But it is more likely that hail-stones, in the proper
sense of the word, are meant as well as expressed in the text. That God
on other occasions has made use of hail-stones to destroy both men and
cattle, we have ample proof in the plague of hail that fell on the
Egyptians. See the note on [Exo 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#018.md).
There is now before me a square of glass, taken out of a south window in
the house of Mr. Ball of Crockerton, in the parish of Longbridge
Deverell, county of Wilts., through which a hail-stone passed in a
shower that fell there June 1, 1780, at two o'clock, P.M. The hole is an
obtuse ellipsis or oval, and is cut as true as if it had been done with
a diamond: it is three inches and a half in diameter; a proof that the
stone that pierced it, which was about eleven inches in circumference,
came with inconceivable velocity, else the glass must have been shivered
to pieces. I have known a cannon ball go through a square of glass in
the cabin window of a ship, and make precisely the same kind of hole,
without either shattering or even starring the glass. It is needless to
add that this hail-shower did great damage, breaking even trees in
pieces, and destroying the vegetation through the whole of its extent.
But allowing that extraordinary showers of hail have fallen in England
or France, is it likely that such showers ever fell in the promised land
or its vicinity? They certainly have. Albertus Aquensis, one of the
writers in the collection Gesta Dei per Francos, in describing the
expedition of Baldwin I. in the Holy Land, observes that, when he and
his army were in the Arabian mountains, in the vicinity of the Dead Sea,
they suffered incredibly from horrible hail, terrible frost, and
indescribable rain and snow, so that thirty of his men perished by them.
His words are: "Sexta vero die montanis permensis, in extremo illorum
cacumine maxima pertulerunt pericula, in Grandine horribili, in Glacie
terribili, in Pluvia et Nive inaudita, quorum immanitate, et horrore
ingruente ad triginta homines pedites prae frigore mortui sunt." - Hist.
Hieros., p. 307. I conclude, therefore, that a shower of hail-stones may
be meant; and that this shower, though natural in itself, was
supernaturally employed on this occasion, and miraculously directed to
fall where it did, and do the execution described. But I am ready to
grant, notwithstanding, that as a most stupendous miracle was in this
instance wrought, in causing the sun and moon to stand still; there can
be no doubt that the shower of stones, which was also miraculous, might
have been of real stones as well as hail-stones. Of late, this subject
of the fall of real stones from the clouds has been very closely
investigated, and not only the possibility of the fall of such stones
from the clouds, or from much higher regions, but the certainty of the
case has been fully demonstrated. These substances are now, in
philosophical language denominated aeroliths or air-stones; and the
following table constructed by M. Izarn, a foreign chemist, exhibits a
variety of facts of this kind, and shows the places and times in which
these substances fell, and the testimony by which these facts are
supported. As it is as possible that God might have projected a shower
of stones on these idolaters, even from the moon, as to arrest that
planet in her course, I give the table, and leave the reader to decide,
in the present case, for aeroliths or hail-stones, as may seem to him
most congruous to the fact here related.

These stones generally appear luminous in their descent, moving in
oblique directions with very great velocities, and commonly with a
hissing noise. They are frequently heard to explode or burst, and seem
to fly in pieces, the larger parts falling first. They often strike the
earth with such force as to sink several inches below the surface. They
are always different from the surrounding bodies, but in every case are
similar to one another, being semi-metallic, coated with a thin black
incrustation. They bear strong marks of recent fusion. Chemists have
found on examining these stones that they very nearly agree in their
nature and composition, and in the proportions of their component parts.
The stone which fell at Ensisheim in Alsace, in 1492, and those which
fell at L'Aigle in France, in 1803, yielded, by the Analysis of Fourcroy
and Vanquelin, as in this table: -

Their specific gravities are generally about three of four times that of
water, being heavier than common stones. From the above account it is
reasonable to conclude that they have all the same origin. To account
for this phenomenon, various hypotheses have appeared; we shall mention
three:

1\. That they are little planets, which, circulating in space, fall into
the atmosphere, which, by its friction, diminishes the velocity, so that
they fall by their weight.

2\. That they are concretions formed in the atmosphere.

3\. That they are projected from lunar volcanoes. These are the most
probable conjectures we can meet with, and of these the two former
possess a very small degree of probability, but there are very strong
reasons in favor of the last. Among the reasons we may notice the
following:

1\. Volcanoes in the moon have been observed by means of the telescope.

2\. The lunar volcanoes are very high, and the surface of that globe
suffers frequent changes, as appears by the late observations of
Schroeter.

3\. If a body be projected from the moon to a distance greater than that
of the point of equilibrium between the attraction of the earth and
moon, it will, on the known principle of gravitation, fall to the earth.

4\. That a body may be projected from the lunar volcanoes beyond the
moon's influence, is not only possible but very probable; for on
calculation it is found that four times the force usually given to a
twelve pounder, will be quite sufficient for this purpose; it is to be
observed that the point of equilibrium is much nearer the moon, and that
a projectile from the moon will not be so much retarded as one from the
earth, both on account of the moon's rarer atmosphere, and its less
attractive force. On this subject, see Mr. Haward's valuable paper in
the Philosophical Transactions for 1802, and Dr. Hutton's dissertation
in the new abridgment, part xxi. It is highly probable that the ancile,
or sacred shield, that fell from heaven in the reign of Numa Pompilius,
was a stone of this sort. The description of its fall, as given by Ovid,
Fast. lib. iii., bears a striking resemblance to recent accounts of
stones falling from the atmosphere, particularly in the luminous
appearance and hissing noise with which it was accompanied.

Dum loquitur, totum jam sol emerserat orbem,

Et gravis aethereo venit ab axe fragor.

Ter tonuit sine nube Deus, tria fulgura misit:

Credite dicenti; mira, sed acta, loquor.

A media coelum regione dehiscere coepit:

Summisere oculos cum duce turba suos.

Ecce levi scutum versatum leniter aura

Decidit, a pupulo clamor ad astra venit.

Tolit humo munus -

Idque ancile vocat, quod ab omni parte recisum est.

It is very possible that the Palladium of Troy, and the Image of the
Ephesian Diana, were stones which really fell from the atmosphere,
bearing some rude resemblance to the human form. See the Imperial
Encyclopedia, article Aerolith. I believe it is generally agreed among
philosophers,

1\. That all these aerial stones, chemically analyzed, show the same
properties;

2\. That no stone found on our earth possesses exactly the same
properties, nor in the same proportions. This is an extraordinary
circumstance, and deserves particular notice.

[Joshua 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jos 10:12</span></span>

Then spake Joshua to the Lord - Though Joshua saw that the enemies of
his people were put to flight, yet he well knew that all which escaped
would rally again, and that he should be obliged to meet them once more
in the field of battle if permitted now to escape; finding that the day
was drawing towards a close, he feared that he should not have time
sufficient to complete the destruction of the confederate armies; in
this moment, being suddenly inspired with Divine confidence, he
requested the Lord to perform the most stupendous miracle that had ever
been wrought, which was no less than to arrest the sun in his course,
and prolong the day till the destruction of his enemies had been
completed! Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou,

Moon, in the valley of Ajalon - To account for this miracle, and to
ascertain the manner in which it was wrought, has employed the pens of
the ablest divines and astronomers, especially of the last two
centuries. By their learned labors many difficulties have been removed
from the account in general; but the very different and contradictory
methods pursued by several, in their endeavors to explain the whole, and
make the relation accord with the present acknowledged system of the
universe, and the phenomena of nature, tend greatly to puzzle the plain,
unphilosophical reader. The subject cannot be well explained without a
dissertation; and a dissertation is not consistent with the nature of
short notes, or a commentary on Scripture. It is however necessary to
attempt an explanation, and to bring that as much as possible within the
apprehension of common readers, in order to this, I must beg leave to
introduce a few preliminary observations, or what the reader may call
propositions if he pleases.

1\. I take it for granted that a miracle was wrought as nearly as
circumstances could admit, in the manner in which it is here recorded. I
shall not, therefore, seek for any allegorical or metaphorical
interpretations; the miracle is recorded as a fact, and as a fact I take
it up.

2\. I consider the present accredited system of the universe, called
sometimes the Pythagorean, Copernican, or Newtonian system, to be
genuine; and also to be the system of the universe laid down in the
Mosaic writings - that the Sun is in the center of what is called the
solar system; and that the earth and all the other planets, whether
primary or secondary, move round him in certain periodical times,
according to the quantity of their matter, and distance from him, their
center.

3\. I consider the sun to have no revolution round any orbit, but to
revolve round his own axis, and round the common center of gravity in
the planetary system, which center of gravity is included within his own
surface; and in all other respects I consider him to be at rest in the
system.

4\. I consider the earth, not only as revolving round the sun in 365
days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 48 seconds, but as revolving round its
own axis, and making this revolution in 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4
seconds; that in the course of 24 hours complete, every part of its
surface is alternately turned to the sun; that this revolution
constitutes our day and night, as the former does our year; and it is
day to all those parts which have the sun above the horizon, and night
to those which have the sun below it; and that this diurnal revolution
of the earth, or revolving round its own axis, in a direction from west
to east, occasions what is commonly called the rising and setting of the
sun, which appearance is occasioned, not by any motion in the sun
himself, but by this motion of the earth; which may be illustrated by a
ball or globe suspended by a thread, and caused to turn round. If this
be held opposite to a candle, it will appear half enlightened and half
dark; but the dark parts will be seen to come successively into the
light, and the enlightened parts into the shade; while the candle itself
which gives the light is fixed, not changing its position.

5\. I consider the solar influence to be the cause both of the annual
and diurnal motion of the earth; and that, while that influence
continues to act upon it according to the law which God originally
impressed on both the earth and the sun, the annual and diurnal motions
of the earth must continue; and that no power but the unlimited power of
God can alter this influence, change, or suspend the operation of this
law; but that he is such an infinitely Free Agent, that He can, when his
unerring wisdom sees good, alter, suspend, or even annihilate all
secondary causes and their effects: for it would be degrading to the
perfections of his nature to suppose that he had so bound himself by the
laws which he has given for the preservation and direction of universal
nature, that he could not change them, alter their effects, or suspend
their operations when greater and better effects, in a certain time or
place, might be produced by such temporary change or suspension.

6\. I consider that the miracle wrought on this occasion served greatly
to confirm the Israelites, not only in the belief of the being and
perfections of God, but also in the doctrine of an especial providence,
and in the nullity of the whole system of idolatry and superstition.

7\. That no evil was done by this miraculous interference, nor any law
or property of nature ultimately changed; on the contrary, a most
important good was produced, which probably, to this people, could not
have been brought about any other way; and that therefore the miracle
wrought on this occasion was highly worthy of the wisdom and power of
God.

8\. I consider that the terms in the text employed to describe this
miracle are not, when rightly understood, contrary to the
well-established notions of the true system of the universe; and are not
spoken, as some have contended, ad captum vulgi, to the prejudices of
the common people, much less do they favor the Ptolemaic or any other
hypothesis that places the earth in the center of the solar system.
Having laid down these preliminaries, some short observations on the
words of the text may be sufficient. Joshua's address is in a poetic
form in the original, and makes the two following hemistichs: -

שמש בגבעון דום

וירח בעמק אילון

Shemesh begibon dom:

Veyareach beemek Aiyalon.

Sun! upon Gibeon be dumb:

And the moon on the vale of Ajalon.

The effect of this command is related, [Jos
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#013.md), in the following words: - וידם
השמש וירח עמד vaiyiddom Hashshemesh Veyareach amad, And the sun was dumb
or silent and the moon stood still. And in the latter clause of this
verse it is added: And the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and
hasted not to go down about a whole day.

It seems necessary here to answer the question, At what time of the day
did this miracle take place? The expression בחצי השמים bachatsi
hashshamayim, in the midst of heaven, seems to intimate that the sun was
at that time on the meridian of Gibeon, and consequently had one half of
its course to run; and this sense of the place has been strongly
contended for as essential to the miracle, for the greater display of
the glory of God: "Because," say its abettors, "had the miracle been
wrought when the sun was near the going down, it might have been
mistaken for some refraction of the rays of light, occasioned by a
peculiarly moist state of the atmosphere in the horizon of that place,
or by some such appearance as the Aurora Borealis." To me there seems no
solidity in this reason. Had the sun been arrested in the meridian, the
miracle could scarcely have been noticed, and especially in the hurry
and confusion of that time; and we may be assured, that among the
Canaanites there were neither clocks nor time-keepers, by which the
preternatural length of such a day could have been accurately measured:
but, on the contrary, had the sun been about the setting, when both the
pursuers and the pursued must be apprehensive of its speedy
disappearance, its continuance for several hours above the horizon, so
near the point when it might be expected to go down, must have been very
observable and striking. The enemy must see, feel, and deplore it; as
their hope of escape must, in such circumstances, be founded on the
speedy entering in of the night, through which alone they could expect
to elude the pursuing Israelites. And the Israelites themselves must
behold with astonishment and wonder that the setting sun hasted not to
go down about a whole day, affording them supernatural time totally to
destroy a routed foe, which otherwise might have had time to rally,
confederate, choose a proper station, and attack in their turn with
peculiar advantages, and a probability of success. It appears,
therefore, much more reasonable that Joshua should require this miracle
to be performed when daylight was about to fail, just as the sun was
setting. If we were to consider the sun as being at the meridian of
Gibeon, as some understand the midst of heaven, it may be well asked,
How could Joshua know that he should not have time enough to complete
the destruction of his enemies, who were now completely routed? Already
multitudes of them had fallen by the hail-stones and by the sword: and
if he had yet half a day before him, it would have been natural enough
for him to conclude that he had a sufficiency of time for the purpose,
his men having been employed all night in a forced march, and half a day
in close fighting; and indeed had he not been under an especial
inspiration, he could not have requested the miracle at all, knowing, as
he must have done, that his men must be nearly exhausted by marching all
night and fighting all day. But it may be asked, What is the meaning of
בחצי השמים bachatsi hashshamayim, which we translate in the midst of
heaven? If, with Mr. Bate, we translate חצה chatsah, to part, divide
asunder, then it may refer to the horizon, which is the apparent
division of the heavens into the upper and lower hemisphere; and thus
the whole verse has been understood by some eminently learned men, who
have translated the whole passage thus: And the sun stood still in the
(upper) hemisphere of heaven, and hasted not to go down when the day was
complete; that is, though the day was then complete, the sun being on
the horizon; the line that to the eye constituted the mid heaven - yet
it hasted not to go down; was miraculously sustained in its then almost
setting position; and this seems still more evident from the moon's
appearing at that time, which it is not reasonable to suppose could be
visible in the glare of light occasioned by a noon-day sun.

But the main business relative to the standing still of the sun still
remains to be considered.

I have already assumed, as a thoroughly demonstrated truth, that the sun
is in the center of the system, moving only round his own axis, and the
common center of the gravity of the planetary system, while all the
planets revolve round him, Prop. 2 and 3; that his influence is the
cause of the diurnal and annual revolutions of the earth; nor can I see
what other purpose his revolution round his own axis can possibly
answer, Prop. 5.

I consider that the word דום dom, in the text, refers to the withholding
or restraining this influence, so that the cessation of the earth's
motion might immediately take place. The desire of Joshua was, that the
sun might not sink below the horizon; but as it appeared now to be over
Gibeon, and the moon to be over the valley of Ajalon, he prayed that
they might continue in these positions till the battle should be ended;
or, in other words, that the day should be miraculously lengthened out.

Whether Joshua had a correct philosophical notion of the true system of
the universe, is a subject that need not come into the present inquiry:
but whether he spoke with strict propriety on this occasion is a matter
of importance, because he must be considered as acting under the Divine
influence, in requesting the performance of such a stupendous miracle;
and we may safely assert that no man in his right mind would have
thought of offering such a petition had he not felt himself under some
Divine afflatus. Leaving, therefore, his philosophic knowledge out of
the question, he certainly spoke as if he had known that the solar
influence was the cause of the earth's rotation, and therefore, with the
strictest philosophic propriety, he requested that that influence might
be for a time restrained, that the diurnal motion of the earth might be
arrested, through which alone the sun could be kept above the horizon,
and day be prolonged. His mode of expression evidently considers the sun
as the great ruler or master in the system; and all the planets (or at
least the earth) moving in their respective orbits at his command. He
therefore desires him, in the name and by the authority of his Creator,
to suspend his mandate with respect to the earth's motion, and that of
its satellite, the moon. Had he said, Earth, stand thou still, the
cessation of whose diurnal motion was the effect of his command, it
could not have obeyed him; as it is not even the secondary cause either
of its annual motion round the sun, or its diurnal motion round its own
axis. Instead of doing so, he speaks to the sun, the cause (under God)
of all these motions, as his great archetype did when, in the storm on
the sea of Tiberias, he rebuked the wind first, and then said to the
waves, Peace! be still! Σιωπα, πεφιμωσο· Be Silent! be Dumb! [Mar
4:39](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#039.md); and the effect of this command
was a cessation of the agitation in the sea, because the wind ceased to
command it, that is, to exert its influence upon the waters. The terms
in this command are worthy of particular note: Joshua does not say to
the sun, Stand still, as if he had conceived him to be running his race
round the earth; but, Be silent or inactive, that is, as I understand
it, Restrain thy influence - no longer act upon the earth, to cause it
to revolve round its axis; a mode of speech which is certainly
consistent with the strictest astronomical knowledge; and the writer of
the account, whether Joshua himself or the author of the book of Jasher,
in relating the consequence of this command is equally accurate, using a
word widely different when he speaks of the effect the retention of the
solar influence had on the moon: in the first case the sun was silent or
inactive, דום dom; in the latter, the moon stood still, עמד amad. The
standing still of the moon, or its continuance above the horizon, would
be the natural effect of the cessation of the solar influence, which
obliged the earth to discontinue her diurnal rotation, which of course
would arrest the moon; and thus both it and the sun were kept above the
horizon, probably for the space of a whole day. As to the address to the
moon, it is not conceived in the same terms as that to the sun, and for
the most obvious philosophical reasons; all that is said is simply, and
the moon on the vale of Ajalon, which may be thus understood: "Let the
sun restrain his influence or be inactive, as he appears now upon
Gibeon, that the moon may continue as she appears now over the vale of
Ajalon." It is worthy of remark that every word in this poetic address
is apparently selected with the greatest caution and precision. Persons
who are no friends to Divine revelation say "that the account given of
this miracle supposes the earth to be in the center of the system, and
the sun moveable; and as this is demonstrably a false philosophy,
consequently the history was never dictated by the Spirit of truth."
Others, in answer, say "that the Holy Spirit condescends to accommodate
himself to the apprehensions of the vulgar. The Israelites would
naturally have imagined that Joshua was deranged had he bid the earth
stand still, which they grant would have been the most accurate and
philosophical mode of command on this occasion." But with due deference
both to the objectors and defenders I must assert, that such a form of
speech on such an occasion would have been utterly unphilosophic; and
that the expressions found in the Hebrew text are such as Sir Isaac
Newton himself might have denominated, every thing considered, elegant,
correct, and sublime. Nor does it at all appear that the prejudices of
the vulgar were consulted on this occasion; nor is there a word here,
when properly understood that is inconsistent with the purest axiom of
the soundest philosophy, and certainly nothing that implies any
contradiction. I grant that when the people have to do with astronomical
and philosophical matters, then the terms of the science may be
accommodated to their apprehensions; it is on this ground that Sir Isaac
Newton himself speaks of the rising and of the setting of the sun,
though all genuine philosophers know that these appearances are produced
by the rotation of the earth on its own axis from west to east. But when
matters of this kind are to be transacted between God and his prophets,
as in the above case, then subjects relative to philosophy are conceived
in their proper terms, and expressed according to their own nature. At
the conclusion of the 13th verse a different expression is used when it
is said, So the sun stood still, it is not דסם dom, but עמד amad; ויעמד
השמש vaiyaamod hashshemesh, which expression, thus varying from that in
the command of Joshua, may be considered as implying that in order to
restrain his influence which I have assumed to be the cause of the
earth's motion, the sun himself became inactive, that is, ceased to
revolve round his own axis, which revolution is probably one cause, not
only of the revolution of the earth, but of all the other planetary
bodies in our system, and might have affected all the planets at the
time in question; but this neither could nor did produce any disorder in
nature; and the delay of a few hours in the whole planetary motions
dwindles away into an imperceptible point in the thousands of years of
their revolutions. But the whole effect mentioned here might have been
produced by the cessation of the diurnal motion of the earth, the annual
being still continued; and I contend that this was possible to
Omnipotence, and that such a cessation might have taken place without
occasioning the slightest disturbance in the motions of any others of
the planetary system. It is vain to cry out and say, "Such a cessation
of motion in one planet could not take place without disordering the
motions of all the rest;" this I deny, and those who assert it neither
know the Scripture nor the power of God; therefore they do greatly err.
That the day was preternaturally lengthened, is a Scripture fact. That
it was so by a miracle, is asserted; and whether that miracle was
wrought as above stated, is a matter of little consequence; the thing is
a Scripture fact, whether we know the modus operandi or not. I need
scarcely add that the command of Joshua to the sun is to be understood
as a prayer to God (from whom the sun derived his being and his
continuance) that the effect might be what is expressed in the command:
and therefore it is said, [Jos 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#014.md),
that the Lord Hearkened unto the Voice of a Man, for the Lord fought for
Israel. I have thus gone through the different parts of this astonishing
miracle, and have endeavored to account for the whole in as plain and
simple a manner as possible. It is not pretended that this account
should satisfy every reader, and that every difficulty is solved; it
would be impossible to do this in such a compass as that by which I am
necessarily circumscribed; and I have been obliged, for the sake of
brevity, to throw into the form of propositions or observations, several
points which may appear to demand illustration and proof; for such I
must refer the reader to Astronomical Treatises. Calmet, Scheuchzer, and
Saurin, with several of our own countrymen, have spoken largely on this
difficult subject, but in such a way as, I am obliged to confess, has
given me little satisfaction, and which appears to me to leave the main
difficulties unremoved. Conscious of the difficulties of this subject, I
beg leave to address every candid reader in the often quoted words of an
eminent author: -

Vive, Vale! si quid novisti rectius istis,

Candidus imperti; si non, his utere mecum.

Hor. Epist. l. i., E. vi., ver. 68.

Farewell! and if a better system's thine,

Impart it frankly or make use of mine.

Francis.

Book of Jasher - The book of the upright. See the note on [Num
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#014.md). Probably this was a book which,
in reference to Joshua and his transactions, was similar to the
commentaries of Caesar, on his wars with the Gauls. Critics and
commentators are greatly divided in their sentiments relative to the
nature of this book. The opinion above appears to me the most probable.

[Joshua 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 10:14</span></span>

And there was no day like that - There was no period of time in which
the sun was kept so long above the horizon as on that occasion. Some
learned men have supposed that the Fable of Phaeton was founded on this
historic fact. The fable may be seen with all the elegance of poetic
embellishment in the commencement of the second book of Ovid's
Metamorphoses; but I confess I can see nothing in the pretended copy
that can justify the above opinion.

[Joshua 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jos 10:15</span></span>

And Joshua returned - unto the camp to Gilgal - That the Israelitish
army did not return to the camp at Gilgal till after the hanging of the
five kings and the destruction of their cities, is sufficiently evident
from the subsequent parts of this chapter. When all this business was
done, and not before, they returned unto the camp to Gilgal; see [Jos
10:43](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#043.md). This verse is omitted by the
Septuagint and by the Anglo-Saxon; and it does not appear to have
existed in the ancient hexaplar versions; it stands in its proper place
in [Jos 10:43](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#043.md), and is not only useless
where it is, but appears to be an encumbrance to the narrative. Should
it be considered as genuine and in its proper place, I would propose
that מקדה makkedah should be read instead of גלגלה gilgalah, for we find
from [Jos 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#021.md) that Joshua had a
temporary camp there. Then Joshua returned, and all Israel with him,
unto the camp to Makkedah; after which we may suppose that Joshua having
secured the cave, sent some detachments to scour the country and cut off
all the remaining straggling Canaanites; when this was done they also
returned to the camp at Makkedah, as is related [Jos
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#021.md), and when the business was
completed they struck the camp at Makkedah, and all returned to their
fortified camp at Gilgal, [Jos 10:43](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#043.md).

[Joshua 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jos 10:16</span></span>

Hid themselves in a cave - It is very likely that this cave was a
fortified place among some rocks; for there were many such places in
different parts of Palestine.

[Joshua 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jos 10:21</span></span>

None moved his tongue - The whole transaction of this important day had
been carried on so evidently under the direction of God that there was
not the least murmuring, nor cause for it, among them, for their enemies
were all discomfited. There is an expression similar to this, [Exo
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#007.md), on which the reader is requested
to consult the note.

[Joshua 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jos 10:24</span></span>

Put your feet upon the necks of these kings - This act was done
symbolically, as a token, not only of the present complete victory, but
of their approaching triumph over all their adversaries, which is the
interpretation given of it by Joshua in the succeeding verse.

[Joshua 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jos 10:26</span></span>

Smote - slew - and hanged them on five trees - Hanging alive seems a
barbarous custom: among the Hebrews, criminals were first deprived of
life; this was the debt required by justice: then they were hanged up,
perhaps generally by the hands, not by the neck; this was done by way of
example, to deter others from committing the crimes for which those had
suffered: but they were never permitted to hang thus exposed all night,
as this could have answered no purpose, either of justice or example, as
they could not be seen in the night-season. One day also was deemed
enough for their exposure, it being thought sufficient to show the
public that justice had been executed; and to have exhibited them longer
would have appeared to be a barbarous cruelty which attempted to extend
punishment beyond the possible requisitions of justice. See the note on
[Deu 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#023.md).

[Joshua 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jos 10:28</span></span>

That day Joshua took Makkedah - It is very possible that Makkedah was
taken on the evening of the same day in which the miraculous solstice
took place; but as to the other cities mentioned in this chapter, they
certainly were subdued some days after, as it is not possible that an
army, exhausted as this must have been with a whole night's march, and
two days' hard fighting, could have proceeded farther than Makkedah that
night; the other cities were successively taken in the following days.

[Joshua 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jos 10:29</span></span>

Fought against Libnah - This city was near Makkedah, see [Jos
15:42](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#042.md), and fell to the tribe of Judah,
[Jos 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#020.md), [Jos
10:42](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#042.md), and was given to the priests,
[Jos 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#013.md). Sennacherib besieged it,
after he had been obliged to raise the siege of Lachish. See [Kg2
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#008.md); [Isa
37:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#008.md).

[Joshua 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jos 10:32</span></span>

Lachish - It appears that this was anciently a very strong place;
notwithstanding the people were panic-struck, and the Israelites flushed
with success, yet Joshua could not reduce it till the second day, and
the king of Assyria afterwards was obliged to raise the siege. See
above, and see the note on [Jos 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#003.md).

[Joshua 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jos 10:33</span></span>

Horam king of Gezer - It is likely that Horam was in a state of alliance
with the king of Lachish, and therefore came to his assistance as soon
as it appeared that he was likely to be attacked. Joshua probably sent a
detachment against him, before he was able to form a junction with the
forces of Lachish; and utterly destroyed him and his army. Gezer is
supposed to have been situated near Azotus. See 1 Maccabees 16:34. It
fell to the tribe of Ephraim, [Jos
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#003.md), but was probably taken
afterwards by some of the remnant of the Canaanitish nations; for we
find it was given by Pharaoh to his son-in-law Solomon, [Kg1
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#016.md), which proves that it had got out
of the possession of the Israelites previously to the days of Solomon.

[Joshua 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jos 10:34</span></span>

Eglon - It is likely that this town was not any great distance from
Lachish. See on [Jos 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#003) (note.md).

[Joshua 10:36](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">jos 10:36</span></span>

Hebron - and the king thereof - See the note on [Jos
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#003.md). From [Jos
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#023.md) we learn that the king of Hebron
was one of those five whom Joshua slew and hanged on five trees at
Makkedah. How then can it be said that he slew the king of Hebron when
he took the city, which was some days after the transactions at
Makkedah? Either this slaying of the king of Hebron must refer to what
had already been done, or the Hebronites, finding that their king fell
in battle, had set up another in his place; which was the king Joshua
slew, after he had taken the city and its dependencies, as is related
[Jos 10:37](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#037.md). It appears that the city
of Hebron had fallen back into the hands of the Canaanites, for it was
again taken from them by the tribe of Judah, [Jdg
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#010.md). Debir had also fallen into their
hands, for it was reconquered by Othniel, the son-in-law of Caleb, [Jdg
1:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#011.md). The manner in which Calmet
accounts for this is very natural: Joshua, in his rapid conquests,
contented himself with taking, demolishing, and burning those cities;
but did not garrison any of them, for fear of weakening his army. In
several instances no doubt the scattered Canaanites returned, repeopled,
and put those cities in a state of defense. Hence the Israelites were
obliged to conquer them a second time. This is a more rational way of
accounting for these things, than that which supposes that the first
chapter of Judges gives the more detailed account of the transactions
recorded here; for there it is expressly said, that these transactions
took place after the death of Joshua, (see [Jdg
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001).md), and consequently cannot be the
same that are mentioned here.

[Joshua 10:39](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">jos 10:39</span></span>

Destroyed all the souls - ויחרימו את כל נפש vaiyacharimu eth col
nephesh, they brought every person under an anathema; they either slew
them or reduced them to a state of slavery. Is it reasonable to say
those were slain who were found in arms, of the others they made slaves?

[Joshua 10:40](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">jos 10:40</span></span>

All the country of the hills - See the note on [Deu
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#007.md).

Destroyed all that breathed - Every person found in arms who continued
to resist; these were all destroyed, - those who submitted were spared:
but many no doubt made their escape, and afterwards reoccupied certain
parts of the land. See [Jos 10:36](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#036.md),
[Jos 10:37](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#037.md).

[Joshua 10:41](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">jos 10:41</span></span>

And all the country of Goshen - Calmet contends that this was the very
same country in which the Hebrews dwelt before their departure from
Egypt; and according to this hypothesis he has constructed his map,
causing it to extend from the Nile, which was called the river of Egypt,
along the frontiers of the land of Cush or Arabia. It however appears
plain that there was a city named Goshen in the tribe of Judah, see [Jos
15:51](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#051.md); and this probably gave name to
the adjacent country which may be that referred to above.

[Joshua 10:42](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">jos 10:42</span></span>

Did Joshua take at one time - That is, he defeated all those kings, and
took all their cities, in One campaign; this appears to be the rational
construction of the Hebrew. But these conquests were so rapid and
stupendous, that they cannot be attributed either to the generalship of
Joshua, or the valor of the Israelites; and hence the author himself,
disclaiming the merit of them, modestly and piously adds, because the
Lord Good of Israel fought for Israel. It was by this aid that Joshua
took all these kings and their land at one time - in a single campaign.
And when all the circumstances related in this chapter are properly
weighed, we shall find that God alone could have performed these works,
and that both reason and piety require that to Him alone they should be
attributed.

1\. The principal subjects of this important chapter have been
considered so much in detail in the preceding notes, that there is
little room to add any thing to what has already been said. The
principal subject is the miracle of the sun's standing still; and to
assert that all difficulties have been removed by the preceding notes
and observations, would be to say what the writer does not believe, and
what few readers would perhaps feel disposed to credit. Yet it is hoped
that the chief difficulties have been removed, and the miracle itself
shown to have nothing contradictory in it. If, as is generally believed,
the sun and moon were objects of the Canaanitish adoration, the miracle
was graciously calculated to check this superstition, and to show the
Israelites, as well as the Canaanites, the vanity of such worship, and
the folly of such dependence. Even their gods at the command of a
servant of Jehovah, were obliged to contribute to the destruction of
their votaries. This method of checking superstition and destroying
idolatry God adopted in the plagues which he inflicted upon the
Egyptians; and by it at once showed his justice and his mercy. See the
concluding observations on [Exo 12:51](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#051.md)
(note).

2\. The same God who appeared so signally in behalf of his people of old
is still the governor of the heavens and the earth; and, if applied to,
will do every thing essentially necessary for the extension of his truth
and the maintenance of his religion among men. How is it that faith is
so rarely exercised in his power and goodness? We have not, because we
ask not. Our experience of his goodness is contracted, because we pray
little and believe less. To holy men of old the object of faith was more
obscurely revealed than to us, and they had fewer helps to their faith;
yet they believed more, and witnessed greater displays of the power and
mercy of their Maker. Reader, have faith in God, and know that to
excite, exercise, and crown this, he has given thee his word and his
Spirit; and learn to know that without him thou canst do nothing.
