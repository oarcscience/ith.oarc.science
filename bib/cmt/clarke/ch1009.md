### [1 Chronicles Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 9:0</span></span>

All Israel reckoned by genealogies, [Ch1
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#001.md). The first inhabitants of
Jerusalem, after their return from their captivity, who were chiefs of
the fathers, [Ch1 9:2-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#002.md). Of the
priests, [Ch1 9:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#010.md); Levites, [Ch1
9:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#014.md); porters, their work,
lodgings, etc., [Ch1 9:17-29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#017.md); other
officers, [Ch1 9:30-32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#030.md); the singers,
[Ch1 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#033.md), [Ch1
9:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#034.md). A repetition of the genealogy of
Saul and his sons, [Ch1 9:35-44](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#035.md).

[1 Chronicles 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 9:1</span></span>

Were reckoned by genealogies - Jarchi considers these as the words of
Ezra, the compiler of the book; as if he had said: I have given the
genealogies of the Israelites as I have found them in a book which was
carried into Babylon, when the people were carried thither for their
transgressions; and this book which I found is that which I have
transcribed in the preceding chapters.

[1 Chronicles 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 9:2</span></span>

Now the first inhabitants - This is spoken of those who returned from
the Babylonish captivity, and of the time in which they returned; for it
is insinuated here that other persons afterwards settled at Jerusalem,
though these mentioned here were the first on the return from the
captivity. Properly speaking, the divisions mentioned in this verse
constituted the whole of the Israelitish people, who were, ever since
the days of Joshua, divided into the four following classes:

1\. The priests.

2\. The Levites.

3\. The common people, or simple Israelites.

4\. The Nethinim, or slaves of the temple, the remains of the
Gibeonites, who, having deceived Joshua, were condemned to this service
[Jos 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#021.md), etc. In David's time it is
probable that other conquered people were added, as the successors of
the Gibeonites were not sufficient to perform all the drudgery of the
temple service.

[1 Chronicles 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 9:3</span></span>

And in Jerusalem dwelt - Several of the tribes of Judah, Benjamin,
Ephraim, and Manasseh, took advantage of the proclamation of Cyrus to
return to Jerusalem, and so mingled with the Israelites, and those to
whom Jerusalem had previously appertained; and this was necessary in
order to provide a sufficient population for so large a city.

[1 Chronicles 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 9:4</span></span>

Uthai the son of Ammihud - The list here is nearly the same with those
found in Ezra and Nehemiah, and contains those who returned to Jerusalem
with Zerubbabel; but the list in Nehemiah is more ample, probably
because it contains those who came afterwards. The object of the sacred
writer here was to give the list of those who came first. Now the first
inhabitants, etc.

[1 Chronicles 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch1 9:11</span></span>

The ruler of the house of God - The high priest at this time was Jeshua
the son of Jozadak, ([Ezr 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#008).md), and
Seraiah, ([Neh 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#011).md), called here
Azariah, was the ruler of the house; the person next in authority to the
high priest, and who probably had the guard of the temple and command of
the priests, Levites, etc. It is likely that the person here was the
same as is called the second priest, [Kg2
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#018) (note.md), who was the sagan or
high priest's deputy. See the note there.

[1 Chronicles 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch1 9:13</span></span>

And their brethren - What a prodigious number of ecclesiastics to
perform the Divine service of one temple! no less than one thousand
seven hundred and eighty able-bodied men! and this number is reckoned
independently of the two hundred and twelve porters who served at the
gates of the house of the Lord, [Ch1
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#022.md).

[1 Chronicles 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 9:18</span></span>

The king's gate - That by which the kings of Judah went to the temple;
see on [Kg2 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#018) (note.md).

[1 Chronicles 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch1 9:19</span></span>

Keepers of the entry - Whose business it was to suffer no person to come
to the tabernacle but the priests, during the performance of the sacred
service; see Jarchi.

[1 Chronicles 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 9:20</span></span>

And Phinehas - The Targum says, "And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, was
ruler over them from ancient times, from the day in which the tabernacle
was set up in the wilderness; and the Word of the Lord was his
assistant."

[1 Chronicles 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">ch1 9:30</span></span>

The sons of the priests made the ointment - Only the priests were
permitted to make this ointment; all others were forbidden to do it on
pain of death; see [Exo 30:34-38](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#034.md)
(note), and the notes there.

[1 Chronicles 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">ch1 9:35</span></span>

Whose wife's name was Maachah - Here our translators have departed from
the original, for the word is אחתו achotho, his Sister; but the Vulgate,
Septuagint, Syriac, Arabic, and Chaldee, have Wife; to which may be
added [Ch1 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#029.md), the parallel place.
Almost all the early editions, as well as the MS. editions, have the
same reading. Of all the Polyglots the Complutensian alone has אשתו
ishto, his Wife. His wife is the reading also of Vatablus's Polyglot,
but in the margin he observes that other copies have his sister. There
is most certainly a fault somewhere, for Maachah could not be both the
sister and wife of Jehiel. Whether, therefore, [Ch1
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#029.md) has been altered from this, or
this altered from that, who can tell? A single letter makes the whole
difference: if the word be written with ח cheth, it is Sister; if with ש
shin, it is Wife. The latter is most probably the true reading. It is so
in three very ancient MSS. in my own possession.

[1 Chronicles 9:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">ch1 9:41</span></span>

And Ahaz - This is added by our translators from [Ch1
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#035.md), but such liberties should only
be taken in a note; for although the words are now sufficiently
distinguished from the text by being printed in Italics, yet it is too
much to expect that every editor of a Bible will attend to such
distinctions, and in process of time the words will be found
incorporated with the text.

[Ch1 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#035.md), and the following verses,
are a repetition of what we find in [Ch1
8:29-38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#029) (note.md), where see the notes.
