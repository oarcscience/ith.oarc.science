### [Jeremiah Chapter 51](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 51:0</span></span>

Sequel of the prophecies of Jeremiah against Babylon. The dreadful,
sudden, and final ruin that shall fall upon the Chaldeans, who have
compelled the nations to receive their idolatrous rites, (see an
instance in the third chapter of Daniel), set forth by a variety of
beautiful figures; with a command to the people of God, (who have made
continual intercession for the conversion of their heathen rulers), to
flee from the impending vengeance, [Jer
51:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#001.md). Jehovah, Israel's God, whose
infinite power, wisdom and understanding are every where visible in the
works of creation, elegantly contrasted with the utterly contemptible
objects of the Chaldean worship, [Jer
51:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#015.md). Because of their great
oppression of God's people, the Babylonians shall be visited with cruel
enemies from the north, whose innumerable hosts shall fill the land, and
utterly extirpate the original inhabitants, vv. 20-44. One of the
figures by which this formidable invasion is represented is awfully
sublime. "The Sea is come up upon Babylon; she is covered with the
multitude of the waves thereof." And the account of the sudden
desolation produced by this great armament of a multitude of nations,
(which the prophet, dropping the figure, immediately subjoins), is
deeply afflictive. "Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a
wilderness; a land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth any son of man
pass thereby." The people of God a third time admonished to escape from
Babylon, lest they be overtaken with her plagues, [Jer
51:45](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#045.md), [Jer
51:46](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#046.md). Other figures setting forth in
a variety of lights the awful judgments with which the Chaldeans shall
be visited on account of their very gross idolatries, [Jer
51:47-58](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#047.md). The significant emblem with
which the chapter concludes, of Seraiah, after having read the book of
the Prophet Jeremiah against Babylon, binding a stone to it, and casting
it into the river Euphrates, thereby prefiguring the very sudden
downfall of the Chaldean city and empire, [Jer
51:59-64](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#059.md), is beautifully improved by
the writer of the Apocalypse, [Rev
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#021.md), in speaking of Babylon the
Great, of which the other was a most expressive type; and to which many
of the passages interspersed throughout the Old Testament Scriptures
relative to Babylon must be ultimately referred, if we would give an
interpretation in every respect equal to the terrible import of the
language in which these prophecies are conceived.

[Jeremiah 51:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 51:1</span></span>

Thus saith the Lord - This chapter is a continuation of the preceding
prophecy.

A destroying wind - Such as the pestilential winds in the east; and here
the emblem of a destroying army, carrying all before them, and wasting
with fire and sword.

[Jeremiah 51:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 51:2</span></span>

And will send - fanners - When the corn is trodden out with the feet of
cattle, or crushed out with a heavy wheel armed with iron, with a shovel
they throw it up against the wind, that the chaff and broken straw may
be separated from it. This is the image used by the prophet; these
people shall be trodden, crushed, and fanned by their enemies.

[Jeremiah 51:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 51:5</span></span>

For Israel hath not been forsaken - God still continued his prophets
among them; he had never cast them wholly off. Even in the midst of
wrath - highly deserved and inflicted punishment, he has remembered
mercy; and is now about to crown what he has done by restoring them to
their own land. I conceive אשם asham, which we translate sin, as rather
signifying punishment, which meaning it often has.

[Jeremiah 51:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 51:7</span></span>

Made all the earth drunken - The cup of God's wrath is the plenitude of
punishment, that he inflicts on transgressors. It is represented as
intoxicating and making them mad.

[Jeremiah 51:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 51:8</span></span>

Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed - These appear to be the words
of some of the spectators of Babylon's misery.

[Jeremiah 51:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 51:9</span></span>

We would have healed Babylon - Had it been in our power, we would have
saved her; but we could not turn away the judgment of God.

[Jeremiah 51:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 51:10</span></span>

The Lord hath brought forth our righteousness - This is the answer of
the Jews. God has vindicated our cause.

[Jeremiah 51:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 51:11</span></span>

Make bright the arrows - This is the prophet's address to Babylon.

The Lord hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes - Of
Cyaxares king of Media, called Darius the Mede in Scripture; and of
Cyrus king of Persia, presumptive heir of the throne of Cyaxares, his
uncle. Cambyses, his father, sent him, Cyrus, with 30, 000 men to assist
his uncle Cyaxares, against Neriglissar king of Babylon, and by these
was Babylon overthrown.

[Jeremiah 51:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 51:12</span></span>

Set up the standard - A call to the enemies of Babylon to invest the
city and press the siege.

[Jeremiah 51:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 51:13</span></span>

O thou that dwellest upon many waters - Thou who hast an abundant supply
of waters. It was built on the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates;
the latter running through the city. But the many waters may mean the
many nations which belonged to the Babylonish empire; nations and people
are frequently so called in Scripture.

[Jeremiah 51:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 51:14</span></span>

I will fill thee with men - By means of these very waters through the
channel of thy boasted river, thou shalt be filled with men, suddenly
appearing as an army of locusts; and, without being expected, shall lift
up a terrific cry, as soon as they have risen from the channel of the
river.

[Jeremiah 51:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 51:15</span></span>

He hath made the earth by his power - The omnipotence of God is
particularly manifested in the works of creation.

He hath established the world by his wisdom - The omniscience of God is
particularly seen in the government of תבל tebel, the inhabited surface
of the globe. What a profusion of wisdom and skill is apparent in that
wondrous system of providence by which he governs and provides for every
living thing.

And hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding - Deep thought,
comprehensive design, and consummate skill are especially seen in the
formation, magnitudes, distances, revolutions, and various affections of
the heavenly bodies.

[Jeremiah 51:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 51:16</span></span>

When he uttereth his voice - Sends thunder.

There is a multitude of waters - For the electric spark, by decomposing
atmospheric air, converts the hydrogen and oxygen gases, of which it is
composed, into water; which falls down in the form of rain.

Causeth the vapours to ascend - He is the Author of that power of
evaporation by which the water is rarified, and, being lighter than the
air, ascends in form of vapor, forms clouds, and is ready to be sent
down again to water the earth by the action of his lightnings, as
before. And by those same lightnings, and the agency of heat in general,
currents of air are formed, moving in various directions, which we call
winds.

[Jeremiah 51:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 51:17</span></span>

Every man is brutish by his knowledge - He is brutish for want of real
knowledge; and he is brutish when he acknowledges that an idol is any
thing in the world. These verses, from fifteen to nineteen, are
transcribed from [Jer 10:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#012.md).

[Jeremiah 51:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 51:20</span></span>

Thou art my battle axe - I believe Nebuchadnezzar is meant, who is
called, [Jer 50:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#023.md), the hammer of the
whole earth. Others think the words are spoken of Cyrus. All the verbs
are in the past tense: "With thee have I broken in pieces," etc., etc.

[Jeremiah 51:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 51:24</span></span>

And I will render - The ו vau should be translated but, of which it has
here the full power: "But I will render unto Babylon."

[Jeremiah 51:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 51:25</span></span>

O destroying mountain - An epithet which he applies to the Babylonish
government; it is like a burning mountain, which, by vomiting continual
streams of burning lava inundates and destroys all towns, villages
fields, etc., in its vicinity.

And roll thee down from the rocks - I will tumble thee from the rocky
base on which thou restest. The combustible matter in thy bowels being
exhausted, thou shalt appear as an extinguished crater; and the stony
mutter which thou castest out shall not be of sufficient substance to
make a foundation stone for solidity, or a corner stone for beauty, [Jer
51:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#026.md). Under this beautiful and most
expressive metaphor, the prophet shows the nature of the Babylonish
government; setting the nations on fire, deluging and destroying them by
its troops, till at last, exhausted, it tumbles down, is extinguished,
and leaves nothing as a basis to erect a new form of government on; but
is altogether useless, like the cooled lava, which is, properly
speaking, fit for no human purpose.

[Jeremiah 51:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 51:27</span></span>

Set ye up a standard - Another summons to the Medes and Persians to
attack Babylon.

Ararat, Minni - The Greater and Lesser Armenia.

And Ashchenaz - A part of Phrygia, near the Hellespont. So Bochart,
Phaleg, lib. 1 c. 3, lib. 3 c. 9. Concerning Ashchenaz Homer seems to
speak, Il. 2:370, 371: -

Φορκυς αυ Φρυγας ηγε, και Ασκανιος θεοειδης,

Τηλ' εξ Ασκανιης.

"Ascanius, godlike youth, and Phorcys led

The Phrygians from Ascania's distant land."

Calmet thinks that the Ascantes, who dwelt in the vicinity of the
Tanais, are meant.

[Jeremiah 51:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 51:29</span></span>

And the land shall tremble - It is represented here as trembling under
the numerous armies that are passing over it, and the prancing of their
horses.

[Jeremiah 51:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 51:30</span></span>

The mighty men - have forborne to fight - They were panic-struck when
they found the Medes and Persians within their walls, and at once saw
that resistance was useless.

[Jeremiah 51:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jer 51:31</span></span>

One post shall run to meet another - As the city was taken by surprise,
in the manner already related, so now messengers, one after another,
were dispatched to give the king information of what was done; viz.,
that the city was taken at one end. Herodotus tells us that the extreme
parts of the city were taken, before those of the center knew any thing
of the invasion. Herodot. lib. 1 c. 191.

[Jeremiah 51:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jer 51:32</span></span>

That the passages are stopped - Either the bridges or slips for boats,
by which the inhabitants passed from one side to the other, and may mean
the principal gates or passes in the city, which the victorious army
would immediately seize, that they might prevent all communication
between the inhabitants.

The reeds they have burned with fire - What this means I cannot tell,
unless it refer to something done after the taking of the city. Setting
fire to the reeds in the marshy ground, in order the better to clear the
places, and give a freer passage to the water, that it may neither
stagnate nor turn the solid ground into a marsh. Dr. Blayney thinks it
refers to the firing of the houses, in order to throw the inhabitants
into the greater confusion; but no historian makes any mention of
burning the city, except what is said [Jer
51:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#030.md), "They have burned her dwelling
places;" and this may be a poetical expression. That they burnt nothing
before they took the city must be evident from the circumstance of their
taking the city by surprise, in the night time, with the greatest
secrecy. Still there might have been some gates, barricadoes, or wooden
works, serving for barracks or such like, which obstructed some of the
great passages, which, when they had entered, they were obliged to burn,
in order to get themselves a ready passage through the city. This is the
more likely because this burning of reeds is connected with the stopping
of the passages, burning the dwelling places, and breaking the bars.

[Jeremiah 51:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jer 51:33</span></span>

The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor - The threshing wheel
is gone over her; she is trodden under foot.

[Jeremiah 51:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jer 51:34</span></span>

Nebuchadrezzar - hath devoured me - These are the words of Judea; he has
taken away all my riches.

He hath cast me out - He shall vomit all up; i.e., they shall be
regained.

[Jeremiah 51:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">jer 51:35</span></span>

The violence done to me - be upon Babylon, - and my blood upon the
inhabitants of Chaldea - Zion begins to speak, [Jer
51:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#034.md), and ends with this verse. The
answer of Jehovah begins with the next verse. Though the Chaldeans have
been the instrument of God to punish the Jews, yet in return they, being
themselves exceedingly wicked, shall suffer for all the carnage they
have made, and for all the blood they have shed.

[Jeremiah 51:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">jer 51:36</span></span>

I will dry up her sea - Exhaust all her treasures.

[Jeremiah 51:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">jer 51:37</span></span>

Without an inhabitant - See [Jer
50:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#039.md).

[Jeremiah 51:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">jer 51:39</span></span>

In their heat I will make their feasts - It was on the night of a feast
day, while their hearts were heated with wine and revelry, that Babylon
was taken; see [Dan 5:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#001.md). This feast
was held in honor of the goddess Sheshach, (or perhaps of Bel), who is
mentioned, [Jer 51:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#041.md), as being taken
with her worshippers. As it was in the night the city was taken, many
had retired to rest, and never awoke; slain in their beds, they slept a
perpetual sleep.

[Jeremiah 51:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">jer 51:41</span></span>

How is Sheshach taken! - Perhaps the city is here called by the name of
its idol.

The praise of the whole earth - One of the seven wonders of the world;
superexcellent for the height, breadth, and compass of its walls, its
hanging gardens, the temple of Belus, etc., etc.

[Jeremiah 51:42](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">jer 51:42</span></span>

The sea is come up - A multitude of foes have inundated the city.

[Jeremiah 51:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">jer 51:44</span></span>

I will punish Bel in Babylon - Bel or Belus was their supreme deity.

That which he hath swallowed up - The sacred vessels of the temple of
Jerusalem, which were taken thence by Nebuchadnezzar, and dedicated to
him in his temple at Babylon.

The wall of Babylon shall fall - It shall cease to be a defense; and
shall moulder away until, in process of time, it shall not be
discernible.

[Jeremiah 51:45](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">jer 51:45</span></span>

My people, go ye out - A warning to all the Jews in Babylon to leave the
city, and escape for their lives.

[Jeremiah 51:46](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">jer 51:46</span></span>

A rumor shall - come one year - A year before the capture of the city
there shall be a rumor of war, - and in that year Belshazzar was
defeated by Cyrus. In the following year the city was taken.

[Jeremiah 51:48](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">jer 51:48</span></span>

The heaven and the earth - shall sing for Babylon - Its fall shall be a
subject of universal rejoicing.

[Jeremiah 51:50](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">jer 51:50</span></span>

Ye that have escaped the sword - The Jews.

Let Jerusalem come into your mind - Pray for its restoration; and
embrace the first opportunity offered of returning thither.

[Jeremiah 51:51](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">jer 51:51</span></span>

Strangers are come into the sanctuaries - The lamentation of the pious
Jews for the profanation of the temple by the Chaldeans.

[Jeremiah 51:53](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">jer 51:53</span></span>

Though Babylon should mount up to heaven - Though it were fortified even
to the skies, it shall fall by the enemies that I will send against it.

[Jeremiah 51:55](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#055.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">jer 51:55</span></span>

The great voice - Its pride and insufferable boasting.

[Jeremiah 51:56](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#056.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">jer 51:56</span></span>

The Lord God of recompenses - The fall of Babylon is an act of Divine
justice; whatever it suffers, it is in consequence of its crimes.

[Jeremiah 51:57](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#057.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">jer 51:57</span></span>

I will make drunk her princes - See on [Jer
51:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#039) (note.md).

[Jeremiah 51:58](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#058.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">jer 51:58</span></span>

The broad walls of Babylon - Herodotus, who saw these walls, says, "The
city was a regular square, each side of which was one hand red and
twenty stadia, the circumference four hundred and eighty stadia. It was
surrounded by a wall fifty cubits broad, and two hundred cubits high;
and each side had twenty-five brazen gates." - Herod. lib. 1 c. 178. Had
not Cyrus resorted to stratagem, humanly speaking, he could not have
taken this city. For the destruction of this wall and its very vestiges,
see on [Isa 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#019) (note.md).

[Jeremiah 51:59](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#059.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_059">jer 51:59</span></span>

The word which Jeremiah - On account of the message sent by Jeremiah to
the Jewish captives in Babylon.

[Jeremiah 51:60](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#060.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_060">jer 51:60</span></span>

Wrote in a book - Whether this book contained any more than is recorded
in this place we do not know; probably it contained no more than what is
found in [Jer 51:62-64](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#062.md). A book, ספר
sepher, signifies, in Hebrew, any writing, great or small.

[Jeremiah 51:64](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#064.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_064">jer 51:64</span></span>

Thus shall Babylon sink, etc. - This is the emblem of its overthrow and
irretrievable ruin. See [Rev 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#021.md),
where we find that this is an emblem of the total ruin of mystical
Babylon.

Herodotus relates a similar action of the Phocaeans, who, having
resolved to leave their country, and never return to it again, μυδρον
σιδηρεον κατεπονωσαν, και ωμοσαν μη πριν ες Φωκαιην ἡξειν, πριν η τον
μυδρον τουτον αναφηναι· "threw a mass of iron into the sea, and swore
that they would never return to Phocaea till that iron mass should rise
and swim on the top." The story is this: The Phocaeans, being besieged
by Harpagus, general of the Persians, demanded one day's truce to
deliberate on the propositions he had made to them relative to their
surrendering their city; and begged that in the mean while he would take
off his army from the walls. Harpagus having consented, they carried
their wives, children, and their most valuable effects, aboard their
ships; then, throwing a mass of iron into the sea, bound themselves by
an oath never to return till that iron should rise to the top and swim.
See Herodotus, lib. 1 c. 165.

Horace refers to this in his epode Ad Populum Romanum, Epode 16 ver. 25:
-

Sed juremus in haec: simul imis saxa renarint

Vadis levata, ne redire sit nefas.

"As the Phocaeans oft for freedom bled,

At length with imprecated curses fled."

Francis.

Thus far are the words of Jeremiah - It appears that the following
chapter is not the work of this prophet: it is not his style. The author
of it writes Jehoiachin; Jeremiah writes him always Jeconiah, or Coniah.
It is merely historical, and is very similar to 2 Kings 24:18-25:30. The
author, whoever he was, relates the capture of Jerusalem, the fate of
Zedekiah, the pillage and burning of the city and the temple. He
mentions also certain persons of distinction who were slain by the
Chaldeans. He mentions the number of the captives that were carried to
Babylon at three different times; and concludes with the deliverance of
King Jehoiachin from prison in Babylon, in which he had been for
thirty-seven years. It is very likely that the whole chapter has been
compiled from some chronicle of that time, or it was designed as a
preface to the Book of the Lamentations; and would stand with great
propriety before it, as it contains the facts on which that inimitable
poem is built. Were it allowable, I would remove it to that place.
