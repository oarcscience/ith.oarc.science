### [Isaiah Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 36:0</span></span>

Sennacherib, king of Assyria, comes against Judah, and takes all the
fenced cities, [Isa 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#001.md). He
afterwards sends a great host against Jerusalem; and his general
Rabshakeh delivers an insulting and blasphemous message to Hezekiah, vv.
2-20. Hezekiah and his people are greatly afflicted at the words of
Rabshakeh, [Isa 36:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#021.md), [Isa
36:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#022.md).

The history of the invasion of Sennacherib, and of the miraculous
destruction of his army Which makes the subject of so many of Isaiah's
prophecies, is very properly inserted here as affording the best light
to many parts of those prophecies, and as almost necessary to introduce
the prophecy in the thirty-seventh chapter, being the answer of God to
Hezekiah's prayer, which could not be properly understood without it. We
find the same narrative in the Second Book of Kings, chaps. 18, 19, 20.;
and these chapters of Isaiah, 36, 37, 38, [Isa
39:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#001.md), for much the greater part,
(the account of the sickness of Hezekiah only excepted), are but a
different copy of that narration. The difference of the two copies is
little more than what has manifestly arisen from the mistakes of
transcribers; they mutually correct each other, and most of the mistakes
may be perfectly rectified by a collation of the two copies with the
assistance of the ancient versions. Some few sentences, or members of
sentences, are omitted in this copy of Isaiah, which are found in the
other copy in the Book of Kings. Whether these omissions were made by
design or mistake may be doubted. - L.

[Isaiah 36:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 36:3</span></span>

Then came forth unto him - Before these words the other copy, [Kg2
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#018.md), adds, ויקראו אל המלך vaiyikreu
el hammelech, "And they demanded audience of the king."

[Isaiah 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 36:5</span></span>

I say "Thou hast said" - Fourteen MSS. (three ancient) of Kennicott's
and De Rossi's have it in the second person, אמרת amarta; and so the
other copy, [Kg2 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#020.md).

But they are but vain words - דבר שפתים debar sephathayim, a word of the
lips. Thou dost talk about counsels, but thou hast none; about strength,
but there is none with thee.

[Isaiah 36:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 36:6</span></span>

The staff of this broken reed - A weakened, faithless ally.

On Egypt - The Bodl. MS. adds מלך melech, the king of Egypt; and so
perhaps the Chaldee might read.

It will go into his hand, and pierce it - Will take subsidy after
subsidy, and do nothing for it.

[Isaiah 36:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 36:7</span></span>

But if thou say "But if ye say" - Two ancient MSS. have תאמרו tomeru in
the plural number; so likewise the Septuagint, Chaldee, and the other
copy, [Kg2 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#022.md).

Ye shall worship before this altar "To worship only before this altar" -
See [Ch2 32:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#012.md).

[Isaiah 36:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 36:10</span></span>

Am I now come up without the Lord - Probably some apostate Israelitish
priest might have encouraged the king of Assyria by telling him that
Jehovah had given him a commission against Jerusalem.

[Isaiah 36:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 36:12</span></span>

That they may eat their own dung "Destined to eat their own dung" - לאכל
leechol, that they may eat, as our translation literally renders it. But
the Syriac reads מאכל meechol, that they may not eat, perhaps rightly,
and afterward ומשתות umishshethoth, or ושתות ushethoth, to the same
purpose. Seventeen of Dr. Kennicott's MSS., ten of De Rossi's and two of
my own, read מימי meymey, the water; mine have מימי שניהם meymey
sheneyhem, and write in the margin מימי רגליהם meymey regaleyhem, the
water of their feet, a modest way of expressing urine.

[Isaiah 36:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 36:15</span></span>

This city shall not be delivered - ולא velo, And this city. Ten of
Kennicott's MSS., and nine of De Rossi's, with one (ancient) of my own,
add the conjunction.

[Isaiah 36:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 36:16</span></span>

Make an agreement - ברכה berachah, make a blessing with me; i.e., Give
me a ransom for the city, and I will not destroy it; give me the yearly
tribute thou hast promised.

[Isaiah 36:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 36:17</span></span>

And vineyards - The other copy, [Kg2
18:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#032.md), adds here: "A land of
oil-olive, and of honey; that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not
unto Hezekiah when he seduceth you."

[Isaiah 36:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 36:19</span></span>

Where are the gods - Many MSS. add the conjunction here also: And, or
But, where are the gods, etc.

For other matters relative to this chapter, see the notes on [Kg2
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#013) (note.md), etc.

Of Sepharvaim - The other copy, [Kg2
18:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#034.md), adds, of "Henah and Ivah."

Have they delivered - וכי vechi. The copulative is not expressed here by
the Septuagint, Syriac, Vulgate, and three MSS.; nor is it in any other
copy. Ib. Houbigant reads הכי hachi, with the interrogative particle; a
probable conjecture, which the ancient Versions above quoted seem to
favor.

[Isaiah 36:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 36:21</span></span>

But they held their peace "But the people held their peace" - The word
העם haam, the people, is supplied from the other copy, and is authorized
by a MS. which inserts it after אתו otho.
