### [Deuteronomy Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 3:0</span></span>

The war with Og, king of Bashan, [Deu
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#001), [Deu
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#002). He is defeated, [Deu
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#003). Sixty fortified cities with many
unwalled towns taken, [Deu 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#004), [Deu
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#005). The utter destruction of the
people, [Deu 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#006). The spoils, [Deu
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#007); and extent of the land taken,
[Deu 3:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#008). Account of Og's iron
bedstead, [Deu 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#011). The land given to
the Reubenites, Gadites, and half tribe of Manasseh, [Deu
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#012), [Deu
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#013). Jair takes the country of Argob,
[Deu 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#014). Gilead is given unto
Machir, [Deu 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#015). And the rest of the
land possessed by the Reubenites and Gadites, [Deu
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#016), [Deu
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#017). The directions given to those
tribes, [Deu 3:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#018). The counsel
given to Joshua, [Deu 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#021), [Deu
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#022). Moses's prayer to God for
permission to go into the promised land, [Deu
3:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#023); and God's refusal, [Deu
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#026). He is commanded to go up to
Mount Pisgah to see it, [Deu 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#027); and
to encourage Joshua, [Deu 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#028). They
continue in the valley opposite to Beth-peor, [Deu
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#029).

[Deuteronomy 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 3:4</span></span>

All the region of Argob - כל חבל ארגב col chebel Argob, all the cable or
cord of Argob; this expression, which is used in various other parts of
Scripture, (see, in the original, [Amo
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#017); [Mic
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#005); [Deu
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#009); [Psa
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#006)), shows that anciently land was
measured by lines or cords of a certain length, in a similar way to that
by the chain among us, and the schoenus or cord among the Egyptians.
Some think that it was the region of Argob that was afterwards called
the region of Trachonites.

[Deuteronomy 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 3:9</span></span>

Hermon the Sidonians call - Shenir - I suppose this verse to have been a
marginal remark, which afterwards got incorporated with the text, or an
addition by Joshua or Ezra.

[Deuteronomy 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 3:11</span></span>

Og king of Bashan remained - Og was the last king of the Amorites; his
kingdom appears to have taken its name from the hill of Bashan; the
country has been since called Batanaea.

Remnant of giants - Of the Rephaim. See on [Deu
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#010) (note), [Deu
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#011) (note).

His bedstead was - of iron - Iron was probably used partly for its
strength and durability, and partly to prevent noxious vermin from
harbouring in it.

Is it not in Rabbath, of the children of Ammon? - The bedstead was
probably taken in some battle between the Ammonites and Amorites, in
which the former had gained the victory. The bedstead was carried a
trophy and placed in Rabbath, which appears, from [Sa2
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#026), to have been the royal city of
the children of Ammon.

Nine cubits was the length - four cubits the breadth - Allowing the
bedstead to have been one cubit longer than Og, which is certainly
sufficient, and allowing the cubit to be about eighteen inches long, for
this is perhaps the average of the cubit of a man, then Og was twelve
feet high. This may be deemed extraordinary, and perhaps almost
incredible, and therefore many commentators have, according to their
fancy, lengthened the bedstead and shortened the man, making the former
one-third longer than the person who lay on it, that they might reduce
Og to six cubits; but even in this way they make him at least nine feet
high.

On this subject the rabbins have trifled most sinfully. I shall give one
specimen. In the Targum of Jonathan ben Uzziel on [Num
21:33-35](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#033), it is said that "Og having
observed that the camp of the Israelites extended six miles, he went and
tore up a mountain six miles in its base, and put it on his head, and
carried it towards the camp, that he might throw it on the Israelites
and destroy them; but the word of the Lord prepared a worm, which bored
a hole in the mountain over his head, so that it fell down upon his
shoulders: at the same time his teeth growing out in all directions,
stuck into the mountain, so that he could not cast it off his head.
Moses, (who was himself ten cubits high), seeing Og thus entangled, took
an axe ten cubits long, and having leaped ten cubits in height, struck
Og on the ankle bone, so that he fell and was slain."

From this account the distance from the sole of Og's foot to his ankle
was thirty cubits in length! I give this as a very slight specimen of
rabbinical comment. I could quote places in the Talmud in which Og is
stated to be several miles high! This relation about Og I suppose to be
also an historical note added by a subsequent hand.

[Deuteronomy 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 3:14</span></span>

Bashan-havoth-jair - Bashan of the cities of Jair; see [Num
32:41](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#041).

[Deuteronomy 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 3:17</span></span>

From Chinnereth - See on [Num 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#011)
(note).

[Deuteronomy 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">deu 3:24</span></span>

The prayer of Moses recorded in these two verses, and his own
reflections on it, [Deu 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#026), are very
affecting. He had suffered much both in body and mind in bringing the
people to the borders of the promised land; and it was natural enough
for him to wish to see them established in it, and to enjoy a portion of
that inheritance himself, which he knew was a type of the heavenly
country. But notwithstanding his very earnest prayer, and God's especial
favor towards him, he was not permitted to go over Jordan! He had
grieved the Spirit of God, and he passed a sentence against him of
exclusion from the promised land. Yet he permitted him to see it, and
gave him the fullest assurances that the people whom he had brought out
of Egypt should possess it. Thus God may choose to deprive those of
earthly possessions to whom he is nevertheless determined to give a
heavenly inheritance.

[Deuteronomy 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">deu 3:26</span></span>

Let it suffice thee - רב לך rab lach, there is an abundance to thee -
thou hast had honor enough already, and may well dispense with going
over Jordan. He surely has no reason to complain who is taken from
earthly felicity to heavenly glory. In this act God showed to Moses both
his goodness and severity.

[Deuteronomy 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">deu 3:28</span></span>

But charge Joshua, etc. - Give him authority in the sight of the people,
let them see that he has the same commission which I gave to thee.
Encourage him; for he will meet with many difficulties in the work to
which he is called. And strengthen him - show him my unfailing promises,
and exhort him to put his trust in me alone; for he shall go over before
this people, and shall cause them to inherit the land; of this let him
rest perfectly assured.

[Deuteronomy 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">deu 3:29</span></span>

Beth-peor - This was a city in the kingdom of Sihon king of the
Amorites; and as בית beth signifies a house, the place probably had its
name from a temple of the god Peor, who was worshipped there. Peor was
nearly the same among the Moabites that Priapus was among the Romans -
the obscene god of an obscene people. This we have already seen.

It is very likely that what God speaks here, both concerning Moses and
Joshua, was designed to be typical of the procedure of his justice and
grace in the salvation of man.

1\. The land of Canaan was a type of the kingdom of heaven.

2\. The law, which shows the holiness of God and the exceeding
sinfulness of sin, could not bring the people to the possession of that
kingdom.

3\. Moses may probably be considered here as the emblem of that law by
which is the knowledge of sin, but not redemption from it

4\. Joshua, the same as Jesus, the name signifying a Savior, is
appointed to bring the people into the rest which God had provided for
them; thus it is by Jesus Christ alone that the soul is saved - fitted
for and brought into the possession of the heavenly inheritance, (see
[Joh 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017); [Gal
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#016); [Gal
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#012), [Gal
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013), [Gal
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#024)); for he is the end of the law -
the great scope and design of the law, for righteousness - for
justification, to them that believe; [Rom
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#004). Such a use as this every pious
reader may make of the circumstances recorded here, without the danger
of pushing analogy or metaphor beyond their reasonable limits.
