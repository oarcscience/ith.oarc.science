### [Jeremiah Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 14:0</span></span>

This chapter begins with foretelling a drought that should greatly
distress the land of Judea, the effects of which are described in a most
pathetic manner, [Jer 14:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#001.md). The
prophet then, in the people's name, makes a confession of sins, and
supplication for pardon, [Jer 14:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#007.md).
But God declares his purpose to punish, forbidding Jeremiah to pray for
the people, [Jer 14:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#010.md). False
prophets are then complained of, and threatened with destruction, as are
also those who attend to them, [Jer
14:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#013.md). The prophet, therefore,
bewails their misery, [Jer 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#017.md), [Jer
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#018.md); and though he had just now been
forbidden to intercede for them, yet, like a tender pastor, who could
not cease to be concerned for their welfare, he falls on the happy
expedient of introducing themselves as supplicating in their own name
that mercy which he was not allowed to ask in his, [Jer
14:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#019.md).

[Jeremiah 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 14:1</span></span>

The word - that came - concerning the dearth - This discourse is
supposed to have been delivered, after the fourth year of Jehoiakim.
Concerning the dearth. We have no historic record of any dearth that may
fall in with the time of this prophecy, and perhaps it does not refer to
any particular dearth: but this was a calamity to which Judea was very
liable. They had ordinarily very dry summers, for scarcely any rain fell
from April to the middle of October; and during much of this time, the
rivers were generally either very low or entirely dry. They kept the
rain of the winter in tanks and reservoirs; and if little fell in
winter, a dearth was unavoidable. See an account of a dearth in the time
of Elijah, [Kg1 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#005.md), through which
almost all the cattle were lost.

[Jeremiah 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 14:2</span></span>

The gates thereof languish - The gates being the places of public
resort, they are put here for the people.

They are black unto the ground - Covered from head to foot with a black
garment, the emblem of sorrow and calamity.

[Jeremiah 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 14:3</span></span>

Their nobles have sent their little ones - So general was this calamity,
that the servants no longer attended to their lords, but every one was
interested alone for himself; and the nobles of the land were obliged to
employ their own children to scour the land, to see if any water could
be found in the tanks or the pits. In the dearth in the time of Elijah,
Ahab the king, and Obadiah his counselor, were obliged to traverse the
land themselves, in order to find out water to keep their cattle alive.
This and the three following verses give a lively but distressing
picture of this dearth and its effects.

[Jeremiah 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 14:4</span></span>

The ground is chapt - The cracks in the earth before the descent of the
rains are in some places a cubit wide, and deep enough to receive the
greater part of a human body.

[Jeremiah 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 14:6</span></span>

Snuffed up the wind like dragons - תנים tannim here probably means the
hippopotamus, who, after feeding under the water, is obliged to come to
the surface in order to take in fresh draughts of air; or it may mean
the wild asses.

[Jeremiah 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 14:7</span></span>

O Lord, though our iniquities testify against us - We deeply acknowledge
that we have sinned, and deserve nothing but death. Yet act for thy
name's sake - work in our behalf, that we perish not.

[Jeremiah 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 14:8</span></span>

O the hope of Israel - O thou who art the only object of the hope of
this people.

The Savior thereof in time of trouble - Who hast never yet abandoned
them that seek thee.

Why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land - As one who has no
interest in the prosperity and safety of the country.

And as a way-faring man - A traveler on his journey.

That turneth aside to tarry for a night? - Who stays the shortest time
he can; and takes up his lodging in a tent or caravanserai, for the dead
of the night, that he may pursue his journey by break of day. Instead of
dwelling among us, thou hast scarcely paid the most transient visit to
thy land. O come once more, and dwell among us.

[Jeremiah 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 14:9</span></span>

Yet thou, O Lord, art in the midst of us - Thy ark, temple, and sacred
rites, are all here; and thou thyself, who art every where present, art
here also: but alas! thou dost not reveal thyself as the Father of
mercies, who forgivest iniquity, transgression, and sin.

We are called by thy name; leave us not - Let us call thee our Father,
and say thou to us, "Ye are my sons and daughters!" O leave us not!

[Jeremiah 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 14:10</span></span>

Thus have they loved to wander - And the measure of your iniquity being
now full, ye must be punished.

[Jeremiah 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 14:11</span></span>

Pray not for this people - They are ripe for destruction, intercede not
for them. O, how dreadful is the state of that people in reference to
whom the Lord says to his ministers, Pray not for them; or, what amounts
nearly to a prohibition, withholds from his ministers the spirit of
prayer and intercession in behalf of the people!

[Jeremiah 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 14:13</span></span>

Ah, Lord God! behold, the prophets say unto them - True, Lord, they are
exceedingly wicked; but the false prophets have deceived them; this is
some mitigation of their offense. This plea God does not admit; and why?
the people believed them, without having any proof of their Divine
mission.

[Jeremiah 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 14:14</span></span>

The prophets prophesy lies - They say they have visions, but they have
them by divination, and they are false. The people should know their
character, and avoid them but they love to have it so, and will not be
undeceived.

[Jeremiah 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 14:15</span></span>

By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed - Jeremiah had told
Jehoiakim that, if he rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar, he should be
overthrown, and the land wasted by sword and famine: the false prophets
said there shall be neither sword nor famine, but peace and prosperity.
The king believed them, and withheld the tribute.

Nebuchadnezzar, being incensed, invaded and destroyed the land; and the
false prophets fell in these calamities. See [Kg2
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#003.md); [Lam
2:11-19](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#011.md).

[Jeremiah 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 14:16</span></span>

And the people - shall be cast out - They shall be destroyed, because
they preferred their lying words to my truth, proclaimed by thee.

[Jeremiah 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 14:17</span></span>

For the virgin daughter of my people is broken - First, the land was
sadly distressed by Pharaoh-necho, king of Egypt. Secondly, it was laid
under a heavy tribute by Nebuchadnezzar. And, thirdly, it was nearly
desolated by a famine afterwards. In a few years all these calamities
fell upon them; these might be well called a great breach, a very
grievous blow.

[Jeremiah 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 14:18</span></span>

If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword -
Every place presents frightful spectacles; the wounded, the dying, the
starving, and the slain; none to bury the dead, none to commiserate the
dying, none to bring either relief or consolation. Even the prophets and
the priests are obliged to leave the cities, and wander about in
unfrequented and unknown places, seeking for the necessaries of life.
Dr. Blayney thinks that the going about of the prophets and priests of
the land, is to be understood thus: - "They went trafficking about with
their false doctrines and lying predictions, as peddlers do with their
wares, seeking their own gain." I think the other sense preferable.

[Jeremiah 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 14:19</span></span>

We looked for peace - We expected prosperity when Josiah purged the land
of idolatry.

And there is no good - For we have relapsed into our former ways.

[Jeremiah 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 14:20</span></span>

We acknowledge, O Lord, our wickedness - This the prophet did in behalf
of the people; but, alas! they did not join him.

[Jeremiah 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 14:21</span></span>

Do not disgrace the throne of thy glory - The temple. Let not this
sacred place be profaned by impious and sacrilegious hands.

Break not thy covenant - See [Exo
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#007.md), [Exo
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#008.md); [Exo
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005.md). They had already broken the
covenant, and they wish God to fulfill his part. They ceased to be his
people, for they abandoned themselves to idolatry; and yet they wished
Jehovah to be their Lord; to defend, support, and fill them with all
good things! But when the conditions of a covenant are broken by one of
the contracting parties, the other party is not bound; and the covenant
is necessarily annulled.

[Jeremiah 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 14:22</span></span>

Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles - Probably the dearth
was now coming, as there had been a long want of rain. It was the
prerogative of the true God to give rain and send showers at the prayers
of his people.

Therefore we will wait upon thee - If thou do not undertake for us, we
must be utterly ruined.
