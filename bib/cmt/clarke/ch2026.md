### [2 Chronicles Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 26:0</span></span>

Uzziah, the son of Amaziah, succeeds; and begins his reign piously and
prosperously, which continued during the life of Zechariah the prophet,
[Ch2 26:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#001.md). He fights successfully
against the Philistines, and takes and dismantles some of their chief
cities, [Ch2 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#006.md); prevails over the
Arabians and Mehunims, [Ch2 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#007.md); and
brings the Ammonites under tribute, [Ch2
26:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#008.md). He fortifies Jerusalem, and
builds towers in different parts of the country, and delights in
husbandry, [Ch2 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#009.md), [Ch2
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#010.md). An account of his military
strength, warlike instruments, and machines, [Ch2
26:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#011.md). He is elated with his
prosperity, invades the priest's office, and is smitten with the
leprosy, [Ch2 26:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#016.md). He is obliged
to abdicate the regal office, and dwell apart from this people, his son
Jotham acting as regent, [Ch2 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#021.md).
His death and burial, [Ch2 26:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#022.md), [Ch2
26:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#023.md).

[2 Chronicles 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 26:1</span></span>

The people of Judah took Uzziah - They all agreed to place this son on
his father's throne.

[2 Chronicles 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 26:2</span></span>

He built Eloth - See the notes on [Kg2
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#021.md). This king is called by several
different names; see the note on [Kg2
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#001.md).

[2 Chronicles 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 26:5</span></span>

In the days of Zechariah - Who this was we know not, but by the
character that is given of him here. He was wise in the visions of God -
in giving the true interpretation of Divine prophecies. He was probably
the tutor of Uzziah.

[2 Chronicles 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 26:7</span></span>

And God helped him - "And the Word of the Lord helped him against the
Philistines, and against the Arabians who lived in Gerar, and the plains
of Meun." - Targum. These are supposed to be the Arabs which are called
the Meuneons, or Munites, or Meonites.

[2 Chronicles 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 26:8</span></span>

The Ammonites gave gifts - Paid an annual tribute.

[2 Chronicles 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 26:10</span></span>

Built towers in the desert - For the defense of his flocks, and his
shepherds and husbandmen.

And in Carmel - Calmet remarks that there were two Carmels in Judea: one
in the tribe of Judah, where Nabal lived, and the other on the coast of
the Mediterranean Sea, near to Kishon; and both fertile in vines.

He loved husbandry - This is a perfection in a king: on husbandry every
state depends. Let their trade or commerce be what they may, there can
be no true national prosperity if agriculture do not prosper; for the
king himself is served by the field. When, therefore, the king of a
country encourages agriculture, an emulation is excited among his
subjects; the science is cultivated; and the earth yields its proper
increase; then, should trade and commerce fail, the people cannot be
reduced to wretchedness, because there is plenty of bread.

[2 Chronicles 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 26:14</span></span>

Shields, and spears - He prepared a vast number of military weapons,
that he might have them in readiness to put into the hands of his
subjects on any exigency.

[2 Chronicles 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 26:15</span></span>

Engines - to shoot arrows and great stones - The Targum says, "He made
in Jerusalem ingenious instruments, and little hollow towers, to stand
upon the towers and upon the bastions, for the shooting of arrows, and
projecting of great stones."

This is the very first intimation on record of any warlike engines for
the attack or defense of besieged places; and this account is long prior
to any thing of the kind among either the Greeks or Romans. Previously
to such inventions, the besieged could only be starved out, and hence
sieges were very long and tedious. Shalmaneser consumed three years
before such an inconsiderable place as Samaria, [Kg2
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#005.md), [Kg2
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006.md); Sardanapalus maintained himself
in Nineveh for seven years, because the besiegers had no engines proper
for the attack and destruction of walls, etc., and it is well known that
Troy sustained a siege of ten years, the Greeks not possessing any
machine of the kind here referred to. The Jews alone were the inventors
of such engines; and the invention took place in the reign of Uzziah,
about eight hundred years before the Christian era. It is no wonder
that, in consequence of this, his name spread far abroad, and struck
terror into his enemies.

[2 Chronicles 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 26:16</span></span>

He transgressed against the Lord - "He sinned against the Word of the
Lord his God." - T.

Went into the temple to burn incense - Thus assuming to himself the
priest's office. See this whole transaction explained in the notes on
[Kg2 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#005) (note.md).

[2 Chronicles 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 26:20</span></span>

Because the Lord had smitten him - "Because the Word of the Lord had
brought the plague upon him." - T.

[2 Chronicles 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 26:21</span></span>

And dwelt in a several house - He was separated, because of the
infectious nature of his disorder, from all society, domestic, civil,
and religious.

Jotham - was over the king's house - He became regent of the land; his
father being no longer able to perform the functions of the regal
office.

[2 Chronicles 26:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch2 26:22</span></span>

The rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet -
write - This work, however, is totally lost; for we have not any history
of this king in the writings of Isaiah. He is barely mentioned, [Isa
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md); [Isa
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001.md).

[2 Chronicles 26:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch2 26:23</span></span>

They buried him - in the field of the burial - As he was a leper, he was
not permitted to be buried in the common burial-place of the kings; as
it was supposed that even a place of sepulture must be defiled by the
body of one who had died of this most afflictive and dangerous malady.
