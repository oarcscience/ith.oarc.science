### [Revelation Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#001.md)

[Revelation](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">rev 5:0</span></span>

The book sealed with seven seals, which no being in heaven or earth
could open, [Rev 5:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#001.md). Is at last
opened by the Lion of the tribe of Judah, [Rev
5:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#004.md). He receives the praises of the
four living creatures and the twenty-four elders, [Rev
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#009.md), [Rev
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#010.md). And afterwards of an innumerable
multitude, who acknowledge that they were redeemed to God by his blood,
[Rev 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#011.md), [Rev
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#012.md). And then, of the whole creation,
who ascribe blessing, honor, glory, and power to God and the Lamb for
ever, [Rev 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#013.md), [Rev
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#014.md).

[Revelation 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 5:1</span></span>

A book written within and on the back side - That is, the book was full
of solemn contents within, but it was sealed; and on the back side was a
superscription indicating its contents. It was a labelled book, or one
written on each side of the skin, which was not usual.

Sealed with seven seals - As seven is a number of perfection, it may
mean that the book was so sealed that the seals could neither be
counterfeited nor broken; i.e., the matter of the book was so obscure
and enigmatical and the work it enjoined and the facts it predicted so
difficult and stupendous, that they could neither be known nor performed
by human wisdom or power.

[Revelation 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 5:2</span></span>

A strong angel - One of the chief of the angelic host.

Proclaiming - As the herald of God.

To open the book, and to loose the seals - To loose the seals that he
may open the book. Who can tell what this book contains? Who can open
its mysteries? The book may mean the purposes and designs of God
relative to his government of the world and the Church; but we, whose
habitation is in the dust, know nothing of such things. We are, however,
determined to guess.

[Revelation 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 5:3</span></span>

And no man - Ουδεις· No person or being.

In heaven - Among all the angels of God.

Nor in the earth - No human being.

Neither under the earth - No disembodied spirit, nor any demon. Neither
angels, men, nor devils, can fathom the decrees of God.

Neither to look thereon - None can look into it unless it be opened, and
none can open it unless the seals be unloosed.

[Revelation 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 5:4</span></span>

I wept much - Because the world and the Church were likely to be
deprived of the knowledge of the contents of the book.

[Revelation 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 5:5</span></span>

The Lion of the tribe of Juda - Jesus Christ, who sprang from this
tribe, as his genealogy proves; see on [Mat
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#002) (note.md), [Mat
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#003) (note.md) and [Luk
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#023) (note.md). There is an allusion here
to [Gen 49:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#009.md), Judah is a lion's whelp;
the lion was the emblem of this tribe, and was supposed to have been
embroidered on its ensigns.

The Root of David - See [Isa 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md).
Christ was the root of David as to his Divine nature; he was a branch
out of the stem of Jesse as to his human nature.

Hath prevailed - By the merit of his incarnation, passion, and death.

To open the book - To explain and execute all the purposes and decrees
of God, in relation to the government of the world and the Church.

[Revelation 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 5:6</span></span>

Stood a Lamb - Christ, so called because he was a sacrificial offering;
αρνιον signifies a little or delicate lamb.

As it had been slain - As if now in the act of being offered. This is
very remarkable; so important is the sacrificial offering of Christ in
the sight of God that he is still represented as being in the very act
of pouring out his blood for the offenses of man. This gives great
advantage to faith: when any soul comes to the throne of grace, he finds
a sacrifice there provided for him to offer to God. Thus all succeeding
generations find they have the continual sacrifice ready, and the
newly-shed blood to offer.

Seven horns - As horn is the emblem of power, and seven the number of
perfection, the seven horns may denote the all-prevailing and infinite
might of Jesus Christ. He can support all his friends; he can destroy
all his enemies; and he can save to the uttermost all that come unto God
through him.

Seven eyes - To denote his infinite knowledge and wisdom: but as these
seven eyes are said to be the seven Spirits of God, they seem to denote
rather his providence, in which he often employs the ministry of angels;
therefore, these are said to be sent forth into all the earth. See on
[Rev 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#004) (note.md).

[Revelation 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 5:7</span></span>

He came and took the book - This verse may be properly explained by
John, [Joh 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018.md). No man hath seen God
at any time; the only-begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father,
he hath Declared him. With Jesus alone are all the counsels and
mysteries of God.

[Revelation 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 5:8</span></span>

The four beasts - fell down before the Lamb - The whole Church of God,
and all his children in heaven and earth, acknowledge that Jesus Christ
is alone worthy and able to unfold and execute all the mysteries and
counsels of God. See on [Rev 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#009.md)
(note).

Having every one of them harps - There were harps and vials; and each of
the elders and living creatures had one.

Odours, which are the prayers of saints - The frankincense and odours
offered at the tabernacle were emblems of the prayers and praises of the
Lord. That prayers are compared to incense, see [Psa
141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002.md) : Let my Prayer be set forth
before thee as Incense. Hence that saying in Synopsis Sohar, p. 44, n.
37: "The odour of the prayers of the Israelites is equal to myrrh and
frankincense; but on the Sabbath it is preferred to the scent of all
kinds of perfumes." The words which are the prayers of saints are to be
understood as this is my body, this signifies or represents my body;
these odours represent the prayers of the saints.

[Revelation 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 5:9</span></span>

A new song - Composed on the matters and blessings of the Gospel, which
was just now opened on earth. But new song may signify a most excellent
song; and by this the Gospel and its blessings are probably signified.
The Gospel is called a new song, [Psa
96:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md). And perhaps there is an allusion
in the harps here to [Psa 144:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#009.md) : I
will sing a New Song unto thee, O God: upon a Psaltery, and an
Instrument of Ten Strings, etc. The same form of speech is found, [Isa
42:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#010.md) : Sing unto the Lord a New Song,
etc.; and there the prophet seems to have the Gospel dispensation
particularly in view.

Thou - hast redeemed us to God - out of every - nation - It appears,
therefore, that the living creatures and the elders represent the
aggregate of the followers of God; or the Christian Church in all
nations, and among all kinds of people, and perhaps through the whole
compass of time: and all these are said to be redeemed by Christ's
blood, plainly showing that his life was a sacrificial offering for the
sins of mankind.

[Revelation 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 5:10</span></span>

Kings and priests - See [Exo 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006.md)
(note); [Pe1 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005) (note.md), [Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009) (note.md), and the notes there.

[Revelation 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 5:11</span></span>

The voice of many angels - These also are represented as joining in the
chorus with redeemed mortals.

Ten thousand times ten thousand - "Myriads of myriads and chiliads of
chiliads;" that is, an infinite or innumerable multitude. This is in
reference to [Dan 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#010.md).

[Revelation 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 5:12</span></span>

To receive power - That is, Jesus Christ is worthy to take, λαβειν, to
have ascribed to him, power - omnipotence; riches - beneficence; wisdom
- omniscience; strength - power in prevalent exercise; honor - the
highest reputation for what he has done; glory - the praise due to such
actions; and blessing - the thankful acknowledgments of the whole
creation. Here are seven different species of praise; and this is
exactly agreeable to the rabbinical forms, which the author of this book
keeps constantly in view. See Sepher Rasiel, fol. 39, 2: "To thee
belongs כבוד cabod, glory; גדולה gedulah, magnitude; גבורה geburah,
might; הממלכה hammamlakah, the kingdom; התפארת hattiphereth, the honor;
הנצח hannetsach, the victory; וההוד vehahod, and the praise."

[Revelation 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 5:13</span></span>

Every creature - All parts of the creation, animate and inanimate, are
represented here, by that figure of speech called prosopopaeia or
personification, as giving praise to the Lord Jesus, because by him all
things were created. We find the whole creation gives precisely the same
praise, and in the same terms, to Jesus Christ, who is undoubtedly meant
here by the Lamb just slain as they give to God who sits upon the
throne. Now if Jesus Christ were not properly God this would be
idolatry, as it would be giving to the creature what belongs to the
Creator.

[Revelation 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 5:14</span></span>

The four beasts said, Amen - Acknowledged that what was attributed to
Christ was his due.

The four and twenty elders - The word εικοσιτεσσαρες, twenty-four, is
wanting in the most eminent MSS. and versions.

Fell down and worshipped - Επεσαν και προσεκυνησαν· Fell down on their
knees, and then prostrated themselves before the throne. This is the
eastern method of adoration: first, the person worshiping fell down on
his knees; and then, bowing down touched the earth with his forehead.
This latter act was prostration.

Him that liveth for ever - This clause is wanting in ABC, thirty-seven
others, Syriac, Arabic, Coptic, Ethiopic, some copies of the Slavonic,
Itala, and Vulgate; and in Andreas, and Arethas, ancient commentators on
this book. It is also wanting in some editions, and is undoubtedly
spurious. Griesbach has left this and the above twenty-four out of the
text.

Now follow the least intelligible parts of this mysterious book, on
which so much has been written, and so much in vain. It is natural for
man to desire to be wise; and the more difficult the subject the more it
is studied, and the hope of finding out something by which the world and
the Church might be profited, has caused the most eminently learned men
to employ their talents and consume their time on these abstruse
prophecies. But of what use has all this learned and well-meant labor
been to mankind? Can hypothesis explain prophecy, and conjecture find a
basis on which faith can rest? And what have we better in all attempts
hitherto made to explain the mysteries of this book?
