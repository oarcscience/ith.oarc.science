### [Joshua Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#001.md)

[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jos 9:0</span></span>

All the kings of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites,
Hivites, and Jebusites, unite them forces against Joshua, [Jos
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#001.md), [Jos
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#002.md). The inhabitants of Gibeon,
hearing what Joshua had done to Ai, sent ambassadors to him, feigning
themselves to come from a very distant tribe, requesting a friendly
alliance with him, [Jos 9:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#003.md). Their
address to Joshua, and the means they used to deceive the Israelites,
[Jos 9:6-13](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#006.md). The Israelitish elders
are deceived, and make a league with them, which they confirm with an
oath, [Jos 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#014.md), [Jos
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#015.md). After three day they are
informed that the Gibeonites belong to the seven Canaanitish nations,
yet they spare their cities, [Jos
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#016.md), [Jos
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#017.md). The congregation murmuring
because of this, the elders excuse themselves because of their oath,
[Jos 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#018.md), [Jos
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#019.md). They purpose to make the
Gibeonites slaves to the congregation, [Jos
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#020.md), [Jos
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#021.md). Joshua calls them, and
pronounces this sentence against them, [Jos
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#022.md), [Jos
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#023.md). They vindicate themselves, and
submit to their lot, [Jos 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#024.md), [Jos
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#025.md). They are spared, and made hewers
of wood and drawers of water to the congregation and to the altar, [Jos
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#026.md), [Jos
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#027.md).

[Joshua 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 9:1</span></span>

And it came to pass, when all the kings - heard thereof - From this
account it appears that the capture and destruction of Jericho and Ai
had been heard of to the remotest parts of the land, that a general fear
of the Israelitish arms prevailed, and that the different dynasties or
petty governments into which the land was divided, felt all their
interests at stake, and determined to make the defense of their country
a common cause. This was the most prudent step they could take in their
circumstances, and therefore they entered into a confederation in order
to arrest the progress of the Israelites. The Great Sea mentioned here
is the Mediterranean Sea, the coasts of which were inhabited by the
Phoenicians, Syrians, Sidonians, and Philistines. It is very likely that
all these united with the Canaanites for their common safety.

[Joshua 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 9:3</span></span>

The inhabitants of Gibeon heard - These alone did not join the
confederation. Gibeon is supposed to have been the capital of the
Hivites. In the division of the land it fell to the lot of Benjamin,
[Jos 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#025.md), and was afterwards given
to the priests, [Jos 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#017.md). See the
note on [Jos 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#002.md).

[Joshua 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 9:4</span></span>

They did work wilily - Finesse of this kind is allowed by the conduct of
all nations; and stratagems in war are all considered as legal. Nine
tenths of the victories gained are attributable to stratagem; all sides
practice them, and therefore none can condemn them. Much time and labor
have been lost in the inquiry, "Did not the Gibeonites tell lies?"
Certainly they did, and what is that to us? Does the word of God commend
them for it? It does not. Are they held up to us as examples! Surely no.
They did what any other nation would have done in their circumstances,
and we have nothing to do with their example. Had they come to the
Israelites, and simply submitted themselves without opposition and
without fraud, they had certainly fared much better. Lying and hypocrisy
always defeat their own purpose, and at best can succeed only for a
short season. Truth and honesty never wear out.

Old sacks - and wine bottles, old, etc. - They pretended to have come
from a very distant country, and that their sacks and the goat-skins
that served them for carrying their wine and water in, were worn out by
the length of the journey.

[Joshua 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 9:5</span></span>

Old shoes and clouted - Their sandals, they pretended had been worn out
by long and difficult travelling, and they had been obliged to have them
frequently patched during the way; their garments also were worn thin;
and what remained of their bread was mouldy - spotted with age, or, as
our old version has it, bored - pierced with many holes by the vermin
which had bred in it, through the length of the time it had been in
their sacks; and this is the most literal meaning of the original נקדים
nikkudim, which means spotted or pierced with many holes. The old and
clouted shoes have been a subject of some controversy: the Hebrew word
בלות baloth signifies worn out, from בלה balah, to wear away; and מטלאות
metullaoth, from טלא tala, to spot or patch, i.e., spotted with patches.
Our word clouted, in the Anglo-Saxon signifies seamed up, patched; from
clout, rag, or small piece of cloth, used for piecing or patching. But
some suppose the word here comes from clouet, the diminutive of clou, a
small nail, with which the Gibeonites had fortified the soles of their
shoes, to prevent them from wearing out in so long a journey; but this
seems very unlikely; and our old English term clouted - seamed or
patched - expresses the spirit of the Hebrew word.

[Joshua 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 9:6</span></span>

Make ye a league with us - כרתו לנו ברית kirethu lanu berith, cut, or
divide, the covenant sacrifice with us. From this it appears that
heathenism at this time had its sacrifices, and covenants were ratified
by sacrificing to and invoking the objects of their adoration.

[Joshua 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 9:7</span></span>

Peradventure ye dwell among us - It is strange they should have had such
a suspicion, as the Gibeonites had acted so artfully; and it is as
strange that, having such a suspicion, they acted with so little
caution.

[Joshua 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jos 9:8</span></span>

We are thy servants - This appears to have been the only answer they
gave to the question of the Israelitish elders, and this they gave to
Joshua, not to them, as they saw that Joshua was commander-in-chief of
the host.

Who are ye? and from whence come ye? - To these questions, from such an
authority, they felt themselves obliged to give an explicit answer; and
they do it very artfully by a mixture of truth, falsehood, and
hypocrisy.

[Joshua 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 9:9</span></span>

Because of the name of the Lord thy God - They pretend that they had
undertaken this journey on a religious account; and seem to intimate
that they had the highest respect for Jehovah, the object of the
Israelites' worship; this was hypocrisy.

We have heard the fame of him - This was true: the wonders which God did
in Egypt, and the discomfiture of Sihon and Og, had reached the whole
land of Canaan, and it was on this account that the inhabitants of it
were panic-struck. The Gibeonites, knowing that they could not stand
where such mighty forces had fallen, wished to make the Israelites their
friends. This part of their relation was strictly true.

[Joshua 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jos 9:11</span></span>

Wherefore our elders, etc. - All this, and what follows to the end of
[Jos 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#013.md), was false, contrived merely
for the purpose of deceiving the Israelites, and this they did to save
their own lives; as they expected all the inhabitants of Canaan to be
put to the sword.

[Joshua 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 9:14</span></span>

The men took of their victuals - This was done in all probability in the
way of friendship; for, from time immemorial to the present day, eating
together, in the Asiatic countries, is considered a token of unalterable
friendship; and those who eat even salt together, feel themselves bound
thereby in a perpetual covenant. But the marginal reading of this clause
should not be hastily rejected.

And asked not counsel at the mouth of the Lord - They made the covenant
with the Gibeonites without consulting God by Urim and Thummim, which
was highly reprehensible in them, as it was a state transaction in which
the interests and honor of God their king were intimately concerned.

[Joshua 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jos 9:15</span></span>

Joshua made peace with them - Joshua agreed to receive them into a
friendly connection with the Israelites, and to respect their lives and
properties; and the elders of Israel bound themselves to the observance
of it, and confirmed it with an oath. As the same words are used here as
in [Jos 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#006.md), we may suppose that the
covenant was made in the ordinary way, a sacrifice being offered on the
occasion, and its blood poured out before the Lord. See on [Gen
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#010) (note.md), etc.

[Joshua 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jos 9:16</span></span>

At the end of three days - Gibeon is reputed to be only about eight
leagues distant from Gilgal, and on this account the fraud might be
easily discovered in the time mentioned above.

[Joshua 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jos 9:17</span></span>

The children of Israel - came unto their cities - Probably when the
fraud was discovered, Joshua sent out a detachment to examine their
country, and to see what use could be made of it in the prosecution of
their war with the Canaanites. Some of the cities mentioned here were
afterwards in great repute among the Israelites: and God chose to make
one of them, Kirjath-jearim, the residence of the ark of the covenant
for twenty years, in the reigns of Saul and David. There is no evidence
that the preservation of the Gibeonites was displeasing to Jehovah.

[Joshua 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jos 9:18</span></span>

All the congregation murmured - Merely because they were deprived of the
spoils of the Gibeonites. They had now got under the full influence of a
predatory spirit; God saw their proneness to this, and therefore, at
particular times, totally interdicted the spoils of conquered cities, as
in the case of Jericho.

[Joshua 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jos 9:19</span></span>

We have sworn unto them - Although the Israelites were deceived in this
business, and the covenant was made on a certain supposition which was
afterwards proved to have had no foundation in truth, and consequently
the whole engagement on the part of the deceived was hereby vitiated and
rendered null and void; yet, because the elders had eaten with them,
offered a covenant sacrifice, and sworn by Jehovah, they did not
consider themselves at liberty to break the terms of the agreement, as
far as the lives of the Gibeonites were concerned. That their conduct in
this respect was highly pleasing to God is evident from this, that
Joshua is nowhere reprehended for making this covenant, and sparing the
Gibeonites; and that Saul, who four hundred years after this thought
himself and the Israelites loosed from this obligation, and in
consequence oppressed and destroyed the Gibeonites, was punished for the
breach of this treaty, being considered as the violator of a most solemn
oath and covenant engagement. See [Sa2
21:2-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#002.md), and [Eze
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#018.md), [Eze
17:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#019.md). All these circumstances laid
together, prove that the command to destroy the Canaanites was not so
absolute as is generally supposed: and should be understood as rather
referring to the destruction of the political existence of the
Canaanitish nations, than to the destruction of their lives. See the
notes on [Deu 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#010.md), [Deu
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#017.md).

[Joshua 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jos 9:21</span></span>

Hewers of wood and drawers of water - Perhaps this is a sort of
proverbial expression, signifying the lowest state of servitude, though
it may also be understood literally. See below.

[Joshua 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jos 9:23</span></span>

Now therefore ye are cursed - Does not this refer to what was pronounced
by Noah, [Gen 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#026.md), against Ham and
his posterity? Did not the curse of Ham imply slavery, and nothing else?
Cursed be Canaan, a servant of servants shall he be; and does it not
sufficiently appear that nothing else than perpetual slavery is implied
in the curse of the Gibeonites? They were brought, no doubt, under
tribute; performed the meanest offices for the Israelites, being in the
same circumstances with the servile class of Hindoos called the
Chetrees; had their national importance annihilated, and yet were never
permitted to incorporate themselves with the Israelites. And we may
reasonably suppose that this was the purpose of God relative to all the
Canaanitish nations: those who would not renounce their idolatry, etc.,
were to be extirpated; those who did were to be preserved alive, on
condition of becoming tributary, and serving as slaves. See the note on
[Deu 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#017.md).

Hewers of wood and drawers of water - The disgrace of this state lay not
in the laboriousness of it, but in its being the common employment of
the females; if the ancient customs among the same people were such as
prevail now. The most intelligent travelers in those countries represent
collecting wood for fuel, and carrying water, as the peculiar employment
of the females. The Arab women of Barbary do so, according to Dr. Shaw.
The daughters of the Turcomans in Palestine are employed, according to
D'Arvieux, in fetching wood and water for the accommodation of their
respective families. From these circumstances Mr. Harmer reasons thus:
"The bitterness of the doom of the Gibeonites does not seem to have
consisted in the laboriousness of the service enjoined them, for it was
usual for women and children to perform what was required of them; but
its degrading them from the characteristic employment of men, that of
bearing arms; and condemning them and their posterity for ever to the
employment of females. The not receiving them as allies was bitter; the
disarming them who had been warriors, and condemning them to the
employment of females, was worse; but the extending this degradation to
their posterity, was bitterest of all. It is no wonder that in these
circumstances they are said to have been cursed." - Obs., vol. iv., p.
297.

[Joshua 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jos 9:24</span></span>

We were sore afraid of our lives - Self-preservation, which is the most
powerful law of nature, dictated to them those measures which they
adopted; and they plead this as the motive of their conduct.

[Joshua 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jos 9:25</span></span>

We are in thine hand - Entirely in thy power.

As it seemeth good and right unto thee - do - Whatever justice and mercy
dictate to thee to do to us, that perform. They expect justice, because
they deceived the Israelites; but they expect mercy also, because they
were driven to use this expedient for fear of losing their lives. The
appeal to Joshua is full of delicacy and cogent argument.

[Joshua 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jos 9:26</span></span>

And so did he unto them - That is, he acted according to justice and
mercy: he delivered them out of the hands of the people, so that they
slew them not - here was mercy; and he made them hewers of wood and
drawers of water for the congregation, and to the altar of God - here
was justice. Thus Joshua did nothing but what was good and right, not
only in his own eyes, but also in the eyes of the Lord. How long the
Gibeonites were preserved as a distinct people after this, we know not.
That they existed in the time of David, is evident from the circumstance
mentioned on [Jos 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#019.md). They are not
mentioned after the captivity; and it is probable that they were nearly
annihilated by the persecution raised up against them by Saul. Some
suppose that the Gibeonites existed under the appellation of Nethinim;
but of this there is no decisive proof; the Nethinim were probably
slaves of a different race.

On what we meet with in this chapter, we may make the following
observations.

1\. The Gibeonites told lies, in order to save their lives. No
expediency can justify this, nor are we called to attempt it. The
Gibeonites were heathens, and we can expect nothing better from them.
See note at the end of [Jos 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#024.md)
(note).

2\. They did not profit by their falsity: had they come in fairly,
sought peace, and renounced their idolatry, they would have had life on
honorable terms. As it was, they barely escaped with their lives, and
were utterly deprived of their political liberty. Even the good that is
sought by unlawful means has God's curse on it.

3\. We need not be solicitous for the character of the Gibeonites here;
they are neither our models, nor believers in the true God, and
therefore pure religion is not concerned in their prevarication and
falsity.

4\. We see here of what solemn importance an oath was considered among
the people of God; they swore to their own hurt, and changed not. When
once they had bound themselves to their Maker, they did not believe that
any changing circumstances could justify a departure from so awful an
obligation. Thus, reader, shouldst thou fear a lie, and tremble at an
oath.
