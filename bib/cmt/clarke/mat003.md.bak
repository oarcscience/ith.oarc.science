[Matthew 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 3:1</span></span>

John the Baptist - John, surnamed The Baptist, because he required those
to be baptized who professed to be contrite because of their sins, was
the son of a priest named Zacharias, and his wife Elisabeth, and was
born about A. M. 3999, and about six months before our blessed Lord. Of
his almost miraculous conception and birth, we have a circumstantial
account in the Gospel of Luke, chap. 1: to which, and the notes there,
the reader is requested to refer. For his fidelity in reproving Herod
for his incest with his brother Philip's wife, he was cast into prison,
no doubt at the suggestion of Herodias, the profligate woman in
question. He was at last beheaded at her instigation, and his head given
as a present to Salome, her daughter, who, by her elegant dancing, had
highly gratified Herod, the paramour of her incestuous mother. His
ministry was short; for he appears to have been put to death in the 27th
or 28th year of the Christian era.

Came - preaching - Κηρυσσων, proclaiming, as a herald, a matter of great
and solemn importance to men; the subject not his own, nor of himself,
but from that God from whom alone he had received his commission. See on
the nature and importance of the herald's office, at the end of this
chapter. Κηρυσσειν, says Rosenmuller, de iis dicitur, qui in Plateis, in
Campis, in Aere aperto, ut a multis audiantur, vocem tollunt, etc. "The
verb κηρυσσειν is applied to those who, in the streets, fields, and open
air, lift up their voice, that they may be heard by many, and proclaim
what has been committed to them by regal or public authority; as the
Kerukes among the Greeks, and the Precones among the Romans."

The wilderness of Judea - That is, the country parts, as distinguished
from the city; for in this sense the word wilderness, מדבר midbar or
מדבריות midbarioth, is used among the rabbins. John's manner of life
gives no countenance to the eremite or hermit's life, so strongly
recommended and applauded by the Roman Church.

[Matthew 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 3:2</span></span>

Repent - Μετανοειτε. This was the matter of the preaching. The verb
μετανοεω is either compounded of μετα, after, and νοειν to understand,
which signifies that, after hearing such preaching, the sinner is led to
understand, that the way he has walked in was the way of misery, death,
and hell. Or the word may be derived from μετα after, and ανοια,
madness, which intimates that the whole life of a sinner is no other
than a continued course of madness and folly: and if to live in a
constant opposition to all the dictates of true wisdom; to wage war with
his own best interests in time and eternity; to provoke and insult the
living God; and, by habitual sin, to prepare himself only for a state of
misery, be evidences of insanity, every sinner exhibits them
plentifully. It was from this notion of the word, that the Latins termed
repentance resipiscentia, a growing wise again, from re and sapere; or,
according to Tertullian, Resipiscentia, quasi receptio mentis ad se,
restoring the mind to itself: Contra Marcion, lib. ii. Repentance, then,
implies that a measure of Divine wisdom is communicated to the sinner,
and that he thereby becomes wise to salvation. That his mind, purposes,
opinions, and inclinations, are changed; and that, in consequence, there
is a total change in his conduct. It need scarcely be remarked, that, in
this state, a man feels deep anguish of soul, because he has sinned
against God, unfitted himself for heaven, and exposed his soul to hell.
Hence, a true penitent has that sorrow, whereby he forsakes sin, not
only because it has been ruinous to his own soul, but because it has
been offensive to God.

The kingdom of heaven is at hand - Referring to the prophecy of Daniel,
[Dan 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013.md),[Dan
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#014.md), where the reign of Christ among
men is expressly foretold. This phrase, and the kingdom of God, mean the
same thing, viz. the dispensation of infinite mercy, and manifestation
of eternal truth, by Christ Jesus, producing the true knowledge of God,
accompanied with that worship which is pure and holy, worthy of that God
who is its institutor and its object. But why is this called a kingdom?
Because it has its laws, all the moral precepts of the Gospel: its
subjects, all who believe in Christ Jesus: and its king, the Sovereign
of heaven and earth. N. B. Jesus Christ never saved a soul which he did
not govern; nor is this Christ precious or estimable to any man who does
not feel a spirit of subjection to the Divine will.

But why is it called the kingdom of Heaven? Because God designed that
his kingdom of grace here should resemble the kingdom of glory above.
And hence our Lord teaches us to pray, Thy will be done on earth, as it
is in heaven. The kingdom of heaven is not meat and drink, says St.
Paul, [Rom 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#017.md); does not consist in
the gratification of sensual passions, or worldly ambition; but is
righteousness, peace, and joy, in the Holy Ghost. Now what can there be
more than this in glory? Righteousness, without mixture of sin; peace,
without strife or contention; joy, in the Holy Ghost, spiritual joy,
without mixture of misery! And all this, it is possible, by the grace of
the Lord Jesus Christ, to enjoy here below. How then does heaven itself
differ from this state? Answer. It makes the righteousness eternal, the
peace eternal, and the joy eternal. This is the heaven of heavens! The
phrase, kingdom of heaven, מלכות שמים malcuth shamayim, is frequently
used by the rabbinical writers, and always means, the purity of the
Divine worship, and the blessedness which a righteous man feels when
employed in it.

It is farther added, This kingdom is at hand. The dispensation of the
glorious Gospel was now about to be fully opened, and the Jews were to
have the first offers of salvation. This kingdom is also at hand to us;
and wherever Christ crucified is preached, there is salvation to be
found. Jesus is proclaimed to thee, O man! as infinitely able and
willing to save. Believe in his name - cast thy soul upon his atonement,
and enter into rest!

[Matthew 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 3:3</span></span>

The voice of one crying in the wilderness - Or, A voice of a crier in
the wilderness. This is quoted from [Isa
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003.md), which clearly proves that John
the Baptist was the person of whom the prophet spoke.

The idea is taken from the practice of eastern monarchs, who, whenever
they entered upon an expedition, or took a journey through a desert
country, sent harbingers before them, to prepare all things for their
passage; and pioneers to open the passes, to level the ways, and to
remove all impediments. The officers appointed to superintend such
preparations were called by the Latins, stratores.

Diodorus's account of the march of Semiramis into Media and Persia, will
give us a clear notion of the preparation of the way for a royal
expedition.

"In her march to Ecbatane, she came to the Zarcean mountain, which,
extending many furlongs, and being full of craggy precipices and deep
hollows, could not be passed without making a great compass about. Being
therefore desirous of leaving an everlasting memorial of herself, as
well as shortening the way, she ordered the precipices to be digged
down, and the hollows to be filled up; and, at a great expense, she made
a shorter and more expeditious road, which, to this day, is called from
her, The road of Semiramis. Afterwards she went into Persia, and all the
other countries of Asia, subject to her dominion; and, wherever she
went, she ordered the mountains and precipices to be leveled, raised
causeways in the plain country, and, at a great expense, made the ways
passable." Diod. Sic. lib. ii. and Bp. Lowth.

The Jewish Church was that desert country, to which John was sent, to
announce the coming of the Messiah. It was destitute at that time of all
religious cultivation, and of the spirit and practice of piety; and John
was sent to prepare the way of the Lord, by preaching the doctrine of
repentance. The desert is therefore to be considered as affording a
proper emblem of the rude state of the Jewish Church, which is the true
wilderness meant by the prophet, and in which John was to prepare the
way of the promised Messiah. The awful importance of the matter, and the
vehemence of the manner of the Baptist's preaching, probably acquired
him the character of the crier, Βοων. For the meaning of the word John,
see the note on [Mar 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#004.md).

[Matthew 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 3:4</span></span>

His raiment of camel's hair - A sort of coarse or rough covering, which,
it appears, was common to the prophets, [Zac
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#004.md). In such a garment we find Elijah
clothed, [Kg2 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#008.md). And as John had
been designed under the name of this prophet, [Mal
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005.md), whose spirit and qualifications
he was to possess, [Luk 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#017.md), he took
the same habit and lived in the same state of self-denial.

His meat was locusts - Ακριδες. Ακρις may either signify the insect
called the locust, which still makes a part of the food in the land of
Judea; or the top of a plant. Many eminent commentators are of the
latter opinion; but the first is the most likely. The Saxon translator
has grasshoppers.

Wild honey - Such as he got in the rocks and hollows of trees, and which
abounded in Judea: see [Sa1 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#026.md). It
is most likely that the dried locusts, which are an article of food in
Asiatic countries to the present day, were fried in the honey, or
compounded in some manner with it. The Gospel according to the Hebrews,
as quoted by Epiphanius, seems to have taken a similar view of the
subject, as it adds here to the text, Ου η γευσις ην του μαννα, ως
εγκρις εν ελαιω. And its taste was like manna, as a sweet cake baked in
oil.

[Matthew 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 3:5</span></span>

Jordan - Many of the best MSS. and versions, with [Mar
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#005.md), add ποταμω, the river Jordan; but
the definitive article, with which the word is generally accompanied,
both in the Hebrew and the Greek, is, sufficient; and our article the,
which should ever be used in the translation, expresses the force of the
other.

[Matthew 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 3:6</span></span>

Were baptized - In what form baptism was originally administered, has
been deemed a subject worthy of serious dispute. Were the people dipped
or sprinkled? for it is certain βαπτω and βαπτιζω mean both. They were
all dipped, say some. Can any man suppose that it was possible for John
to dip all the inhabitants of Jerusalem and Judea, and of all the
country round about the Jordan? Were both men and women dipped, for
certainly both came to his baptism? This could never have comported
either with safety or with decency. Were they dipped in their clothes?
This would have endangered their lives, if they had not with them change
of raiment: and as such a baptism as John's (however administered) was,
in several respects, a new thing in Judea, it is not at all likely that
the people would come thus provided. But suppose these were dipped,
which I think it would be impossible to prove, does it follow that, in
all regions of the world, men and women must be dipped, in order to be
evangelically baptized? In the eastern countries, bathings were
frequent, because of the heat of the climate, it being there so
necessary to cleanliness and health; but could our climate, or a more
northerly one, admit of this with safety, for at least three-fourths of
the year? We may rest assured that it could not. And may we not presume,
that if John had opened his commission in the north of Great Britain,
for many months of the year, he would have dipped neither man nor woman,
unless he could have procured a tepid bath? Those who are dipped or
immersed in water, in the name of the Holy Trinity, I believe to be
evangelically baptized - those who are washed or sprinkled with water in
the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, I believe
to be equally so; and the repetition of such a baptism I believe to be
profane. Others have a right to believe the contrary, if they see good.
After all, it is the thing signified, and not the mode, which is the
essential part of the sacrament. See the note on [Mar
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#016.md).

Confessing their sins - Εξομολογουμενοι, earnestly acknowledging that
their sins were their own. And thus taking the whole blame upon
themselves, and laying nothing to the charge of God or man. This is
essential to true repentance; and, till a man take the whole blame on
himself, he cannot feel the absolute need he has of casting his soul on
the mercy of God, that he may be saved.

[Matthew 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 3:7</span></span>

Pharisees - A very numerous sect among the Jews, who, in their origin,
were, very probably, a pure and holy people. It is likely that they got
the name of Pharisees, i.e. Separatists, (from פרש pharash, to
separate), from their separating themselves from the pollution of the
Jewish national worship; and hence, the word in the Anglo-saxon version
is, holy persons who stand apart, or by themselves: but, in process of
time, like all religious sects and parties, they degenerated: they lost
the spirit of their institution, they ceased to recur to first
principles, and had only the form of godliness, when Jesus Christ
preached in Judea; for he bore witness, that they did make the outside
of the cup and platter clean - they observed the rules of their
institution, but the spirit was gone.

Sadducees - A sect who denied the existence of angels and spirits,
consequently all Divine influence and inspiration, and also the
resurrection of the dead. The Sadducees of that time were the
Materialists and Deists of the Jewish nation. When the sect of the
Pharisees arose cannot be distinctly ascertained; but it is supposed to
have been some time after the Babylonish captivity. The sect of the
Sadducees were the followers of one Sadok, a disciple of Antigonus
Sochaeus, who flourished about three centuries before Christ. There was
a third sect among the Jews, called the Essenes or Essenians, of whom I
shall have occasion to speak on [Mat
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#012.md).

Come to his baptism - The Ethiopic version adds the word privately here,
the translator probably having read λαθρα in his copy, which gives a
very remarkable turn to the passage. The multitudes, who had no worldly
interest to support, no character to maintain by living in their usual
way, came publicly, and openly acknowledged that they were Sinners; and
stood in need of mercy. The others, who endeavored to secure their
worldly interests by making a fair show in the flesh, are supposed to
have come privately, that they might not be exposed to reproach; and
that they might not lose their reputation for wisdom and sanctity, which
their consciences, under the preaching of the Baptist, told them they
had no right to. See below.

O generation of vipers - Γεννηματα εχιδνων. A terribly expressive
speech. A serpentine brood, from a serpentine stock. As their fathers
were, so were they, children of the wicked one. This is God's estimate
of a Sinner, whether he wade in wealth, or soar in fame. The Jews were
the seed of the serpent, who should bruise the heel of the woman's seed,
and whose head should be bruised by him.

Who hath warned you - Or, privately shown you. Τις υπεδιξεν - from υπο,
under, and δεικνυμαι, to show. Does not this seem to allude to the
reading of the Ethiopic noticed above? They came privately: and John may
be supposed to address them thus: "Did any person give you a private
warning? No, you received your convictions under the public ministry of
the word. The multitudes of the poor and wretched, who have been
convinced of sin, have publicly acknowledged their crimes, and sought
mercy - God will unmask you - you have deceived the people - you have
deceived yourselves - you must appear just what you are; and, if you
expect mercy from God, act like the penitent multitude, and bring forth
Fruit worthy of repentance. Do not begin to trifle with your
convictions, by thinking, that because you are descendants of Abraham,
therefore you are entitled to God's favor; God can, out of these stones
(pointing probably to those scattered about in the desert, which he
appears to have considered as an emblem of the Gentiles) raise up a
faithful seed, who, though not natural descendants of your excellent
patriarch, yet shall be his worthy children, as being partakers of his
faith, and friends of his God." It should be added, that the Greek word
also signifies plain or ample information. See on [Luk
6:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#047) (note.md).

The wrath to come? - The desolation which was about to fall on the
Jewish nation for their wickedness, and threatened in the last words of
their own Scriptures. See [Mal 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#006.md).
Lest I come and smite the earth את הארץ (et ha-arets, this very land)
with a curse. This wrath or curse was coming: they did not prevent it by
turning to God, and receiving the Messiah, and therefore the wrath of
God came upon them to the uttermost. Let him that readeth understand.

[Matthew 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 3:10</span></span>

And now also the axe is laid - Or, Even now the axe lieth. As if he had
said, There is not a moment to spare - God is about to cut off every
impenitent soul - you must therefore either turn to God immediately, or
be utterly and finally ruined. It was customary with the prophets to
represent the kingdoms, nations, and individuals, whose ruin they
predicted, under the notion of forests and trees, doomed to be cut down.
See [Jer 46:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#022.md), [Jer
46:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#023.md); [Eze
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#003.md), [Eze
31:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#011.md), [Eze
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#012.md). The Baptist follows the same
metaphor: the Jewish nation is the tree, and the Romans the axe, which,
by the just judgment of God, was speedily to cut it down. It has been
well observed, that there is an allusion here to a woodman, who, having
marked a tree for excision, lays his axe at its root, and strips off his
outer garment, that he may wield his blows more powerfully, and that his
work may be quickly performed. For about sixty years before the coming
of Christ, this axe had been lying at the root of the Jewish tree, Judea
having been made a province to the Roman empire, from the time that
Pompey took the city of Jerusalem, during the contentions of the two
brothers Hyrcanus and Aristobulus, which was about sixty-three years
before the coming of Christ. See Joseph. Antiq. l. xiv. c. 1-5. But as
the country might be still considered as in the hands of the Jews,
though subject to the Romans, and God had waited on them now nearly
ninety years from the above time, expecting them to bring forth fruit,
and none was yet produced; he kept the Romans as an axe, lying at the
root of this tree, who were ready to cut it down the moment God gave
them the commission.

[Matthew 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 3:11</span></span>

But he that cometh after me - Or, I coming after me, who is now on his
way, and will shortly make his appearance. Jesus Christ began his
ministry when he was thirty years of age, [Luk
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#023.md), which was the age appointed by
the law, [Num 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#003.md). John the Baptist
was born about six months before Christ; and, as he began his public
ministry when thirty years of age, then this coming after refers to six
months after the commencement of John's public preaching, at which time
Christ entered upon his.

Whose shoes I am not worthy to bear - This saying is expressive of the
most profound humility and reverence. To put on, take off, and carry the
shoes of their masters, was, not only among the Jews, but also among the
Greeks and Romans, the work of the vilest slaves. This is amply proved
by Kypke, from Arrian, Plutarch, and the Babylonian Talmud.

With the Holy Ghost, and with fire - That the influences of the Spirit
of God are here designed, needs but little proof. Christ's religion was
to be a spiritual religion, and was to have its seat in the heart.
Outward precepts, however well they might describe, could not produce
inward spirituality. This was the province of the Spirit of God, and of
it alone; therefore he is represented here under the similitude of fire,
because he was to illuminate and invigorate the soul, penetrate every
part, and assimilate the whole to the image of the God of glory. See on
[Joh 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#005) (note.md).

With fire - Και πυρι. This is wanting in E. S. (two MSS. one of the
ninth, the other of the tenth century) eight others, and many
Evangelistaria, and in some versions and printed editions; but it is
found in the parallel place, [Luk
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#016.md), and in the most authentic MSS.
and versions. It was probably the different interpretations given of it
by the fathers that caused some transcribers to leave it out of their
copies.

The baptism of fire has been differently understood among the primitive
fathers. Some say, it means the tribulations, crosses, and afflictions,
which believers in Christ are called to pass through. Hence the author
of the Opus Imperfectum, on Matthew, says, that there are three sorts of
baptism,

1\. that of water;

2\. that of the Holy Ghost; and,

3\. that of tribulations and afflictions, represented under the notion
of fire.

He observes farther, that our blessed Lord went through these three
baptisms:

1\. That of water, he received from the hands of John.

2\. That of the Holy Spirit he received from the Father. And,

3\. That of fire, he had in his contest with Satan in the desert.

St. Chrysostom says; it means the superabundant graces of the Spirit.
Basil and Theophilus explain it of the fire of hell. Cyril, Jerome, and
others, understand by it the descent of the Holy Spirit, on the day of
pentecost.

Hilary says, it means a fire that the righteous must pass through in the
day of judgment, to purify them from such defilements as necessarily
cleaved to them here, and with which they could not be admitted into
glory.

Ambrose says, this baptism shall be administered at the gate of
paradise, by John Baptist; and he thinks that this is what is meant by
the flaming sword, [Gen 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#024.md).

Origen and Lactantius conceive it to be a river of fire, at the gate of
heaven, something similar to the Phlegethon of the heathens; but they
observe, that when the righteous come to pass over, the liquid flames
shall divide, and give them a free passage: that Christ shall stand on
the brink of it, and receive through the flames all those, and none but
those, who have received in this world the baptism of water in his name:
and that this baptism is for those who, having received the faith of
Christ, have not, in every respect, lived conformably to it; for, though
they laid the good foundation, yet they built hay, straw, and stubble
upon it, and this work of theirs must be tried, and destroyed by this
fire. This, they think, is St. Paul's meaning, [Co1
3:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#013.md). If any man build on this
foundation (viz. Jesus Christ) gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay,
stubble; every man's work shall be made manifest: and the fire shall try
every man's work, of what sort it is. - If any man's work be burnt, he
shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as By Fire.
From this fire, understood in this way, the fathers of the following
ages, and the schoolmen, formed the famous and lucrative doctrine of
Purgatory. Some in the primitive Church thought that fire should be, in
some way or other, joined to the water in baptism; and it is supposed
that they administered it by causing the person to pass between two
fires, or to leap through the flame; or by having a torch, or lighted
candle, present. Thus have those called Doctors of the Church trifled.
The exposition which I have given, I believe to be the only genuine one.

[Matthew 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 3:12</span></span>

Whose fan is in his hand - The Romans are here termed God's fan, as, in
[Mat 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#010.md), they were called his axe,
and, in [Mat 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#007.md), they are termed his
troops or armies.

The winnowing fan of the Hindoos is square, made of split bamboo; and
the corn is winnowed by waving the fan backwards with both hands -
"Whose fan is in his hand."

His floor - Does not this mean the land of Judea, which had been long,
as it were, the threshing-floor of the Lord? God says, he will now, by
the winnowing fan (viz. the Romans) thoroughly cleanse this floor - the
wheat, those who believe in the Lord Jesus, he will gather into his
garner, either take to heaven from the evil to come, or put in a place
of safety, as he did the Christians, by sending them to Pella, in
Coelosyria, previously to the destruction of Jerusalem. But he will burn
up the chaff - the disobedient and rebellions Jews, who would not come
unto Christ, that they might have life.

Unquenchable fire - That cannot be extinguished by man.

John forbad him - Earnestly and pressingly opposed him: this is the
proper import of the words διεκωλευεν αυτον. I have observed that δια,
in composition, most frequently, if not always, strengthens the
signification in classic authors. - Wakefield.

[Matthew 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 3:15</span></span>

To fulfill all righteousness - That is, Every righteous ordinance: so I
think the words πασαν δικαιοσυνην should be translated; and so our
common version renders a similar word, [Luk
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#006.md). The following passage, quoted
from Justin Martyr, will doubtless appear a strong vindication of this
translation. "Christ was circumcised, and observed all the other
ordinances of the law of Moses, not with a view to his own
justification; but to fulfill the dispensation committed to him by the
Lord, the God and Creator of all things." - Wakefield.

How remarkable are the following words of Creeshna (an Incarnation of
the Supreme God, according to the Hindoo theology) related in the
Bhagvat Geeta, p. 47. Addressing his disciple Arjoon, he says, "I
myself, Arjoon, have not, in the three regions of the universe, any
thing which is necessary for me to perform; nor any thing to obtain,
which is not obtained; and yet I live in the exercise of the moral
duties. If I were not vigilantly to attend to those duties, all men
would presently follow my example. If I were not to perform the moral
actions, this world would fail in their duties: I should be the cause of
spurious births, and should drive the people from the right way. As the
ignorant perform the duties of life from a hope of reward, so the wise
man, out of respect to the opinions and prejudices of mankind, should
perform the same without motives of interest. The wise man, by
industriously performing all the duties of life, should induce the
vulgar to attend to them."

The Septuagint use this word often for the Hebrew משפת mishpat,
judgment, appointment. And in [Eze
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#019.md), [Eze
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#021.md), the person who δικαιοσυνην και
ελεος πεποιηκε - hath done righteousness and mercy, is he who sacredly
attended to the performance of all the religious ordinances mentioned in
that chapter, and performed them in the genuine spirit of mercy.
Δικαιωματα is used 1 Maccabees 1:13, 49; 2:21, and in [Heb
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001.md), [Heb
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#010.md), to denote religious ceremonies.
Michaelis supposes that כל חק kol chok, all religious statutes or
ordinances, were the words used in the Hebrew original of this Gospel.

But was this an ordinance? Undoubtedly: it was the initiatory ordinance
of the Baptist's dispensation. Now, as Christ had submitted to
circumcision, which was the initiatory ordinance of the Mosaic
dispensation, it was necessary that he should submit to this, which was
instituted by no less an authority, and was the introduction to his own
dispensation of eternal mercy and truth. But it was necessary on another
account: Our Lord represented the high priest, and was to be the high
priest over the house of God: - now, as the high priest was initiated
into his office by washing and anointing, so must Christ: and hence he
was baptized, washed, and anointed by the Holy Ghost. Thus he fulfilled
the righteous ordinance of his initiation into the office of high
priest, and thus was prepared to make an atonement for the sins of
mankind.

Then he suffered him - In the Opus Imperfectum, quoted by Griesbach,
there is the following addition, which, at least, may serve to show the
opinion of its author: Et Johannes quidem baptizauit ilium in aqua, ille
autem Johannem cum Spiritu. "Then John baptized him with water, and he
baptized John with the Spirit."

[Matthew 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 3:16</span></span>

The heavens were opened unto him - That is, to John the Baptist - and
he, John, saw the Spirit of God - lighting upon him, i.e. Jesus. There
has been some controversy about the manner and form in which the Spirit
of God rendered itself visible on this occasion. St. Luke, [Luk
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#022.md), says it was in a bodily shape
like to a dove: and this likeness to a dove some refer to a hovering
motion, like to that of a dove, and not to the form of the dove itself:
but the terms of the text are too precise to admit of this far-fetched
interpretation.

This passage affords no mean proof of the doctrine of the Trinity. That
three distinct persons are here, represented, there can be no dispute.

1\. The person of Jesus Christ, baptized by John in Jordan.

2\. The person of the Holy Ghost in a bodily shape, (σωματικω ειδει,
[Luk 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#022).md) like a dove.

3\. The person of the Father; a voice came out of heaven, saying, This
is my beloved Son, etc.

The voice is here represented as proceeding from a different place to
that in which the persons of the Son and Holy Spirit were manifested;
and merely, I think, more forcibly to mark this Divine personality.

[Matthew 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 3:17</span></span>

In whom I am well pleased - Εν ω ενδακησα in whom I have delighted -
though it is supposed that the past tense is here used for the present:
but see the note on [Mat 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#005.md). By this
voice, and overshadowing of the Spirit, the mission of the Lord Jesus
was publicly and solemnly accredited; God intimating that he had before
delighted in him: the law, in all its ordinances, having pointed him
out, for they could not be pleasing to God, but as they were fulfilled
in, and showed forth, the Son of man, till, he came.

As the office of a herald is frequently alluded to in this chapter, and
also in various other parts of the New Testament, I think it best to
give a full account of it here, especially as the office of the
ministers of the Gospel is represented by it. Such persons can best
apply the different correspondences between their own and the herald's
office.

At the Olympic and Isthmian games, heralds were persons of the utmost
consequence and importance. Their office was: -

1\. To proclaim from a scaffold, or elevated place, the combat that was
to be entered on.

2\. To summon the Agonistae, or contenders, to make their appearance,
and to announce their names.

3\. To specify the prize for which they were to contend.

4\. To admonish and animate, with appropriate discourses, the athletae,
or combatants.

5\. To set before them, and explain, the laws of the agones, or
contenders; that they might see that even the conqueror could not
receive the crown or prize, unless he had strove lawfully.

6\. After the conflict was ended, to bring the business before the
judges, and, according to their determination, to proclaim the victor.

7\. To deliver the prize to the conqueror, and to put the crown on his
head, in the presence of the assembly.

8\. They were the persons who convoked all solemn and religious
assemblies, and brought forth, and often slew, the sacrifices offered on
those occasions.

9\. They frequently called the attention of the people, during the
sacrifices, to the subject of devotion, with hoc age! τουτο πραττε: mind
what you are about, don't be idle; think of nothing else. See Plutarch
in Coriolanus.

The office, and nearly the word itself, was in use among the ancient
Babylonians, as appears from [Dan 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#004.md),
where the Chaldee word כרוזא caroza, is rendered by the Septuagint κηρυξ
kerux, and by our translation, very properly, herald. His business in
the above place was to call an assembly of the people, for the purpose
of public worship; to describe the object and nature of that worship,
and the punishment to be inflicted on those who did not join in the
worship, and properly assist in the solemnities of the occasion.

[Dan 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#004.md), is the only place in our
translation, in which the word herald is used: but the word κηρυξ, used
by St. Paul, [Ti1 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#007.md); [Ti2
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#011.md), and by St. Peter, [Pe2
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#005.md), is found in the Septuagint, [Gen
41:43](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#043.md), as well as in [Dan
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#004.md), and the verb κηρυσσω is found in
different places of that version, and in a great number of places in the
New Testament.

It is worthy of remark, that the office of the κηρυξ, kerux, or herald,
must have been anciently known, and indeed established, among the
Egyptians: for in [Gen 41:43](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#043.md), where an
account is given of the promotion of Joseph to the second place in the
kingdom, where we say, And they cried before him, saying, Bow the knee;
the Septuagint has και εκηρυξεν εμπροσθεν αυτου κηρυξ· And a Herald made
proclamation before him. As the Septuagint translated this for Ptolemy
Philadelphus, the Egyptian king, and were in Egypt when they translated
the law, we may safely infer that the office was not only known, but in
use among the Egyptians, being denominated in their language אברק abrek,
which our translators, following the Vulgate, have rendered, Bow the
knee; but which the Septuagint understood to be the title of an officer,
who was the same among the Egyptians as the κηρυξ among the Greeks. This
is a probable meaning of the word, which escaped me when I wrote the
note on [Gen 41:43](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#043.md).

As every kind of office had some peculiar badge, or ensign, by which it
was known among the ancients, so the heralds were known by generally
carrying a caduceus. This was a rod with two spread wings at the top,
and about which two serpents were entwined. The poets fabled that this
rod was given by Apollo, the god of wisdom and music, to Mercury, the
god of eloquence, and the messenger of the gods. To it wonderful
properties are ascribed - especially that it produces sleep, and that it
raises the dead. Who does not at once see, that the caduceus and its
properties clearly point out the office, honor, and influence of the
herald? As persons of strong voice, and ready speech, and copious
eloquence, were always chosen for heralds, they were represented as
endued with wisdom and eloquence from above. They lulled men to sleep,
i.e. by their persuasive powers of speech, they calmed the turbulent
dispositions of an inflamed populace, when proceeding to acts of
rebellion and anarchy; or they roused the dormant zeal of the community,
who, through long oppression, despairing of succor or relief, seemed
careless about their best interests being stupidly resolved to sink
under their burdens, and expect release only in death.

As to the caduceus itself, it was ever the emblem of peace among the
ancients: the rod was the emblem of power; the two serpents, of wisdom
and prudence; and the two wings, of diligence and despatch. The first
idea of this wonderful rod seems to have been borrowed from the rod of
Moses. See the note on [Exo 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#017.md).

The word κηρυξ kerux, or herald, here used, is evidently derived from
κηρυσσειν, to proclaim, call aloud; and this from γηρυς, the voice;
because these persons were never employed in any business, but such only
as could not be transacted but by the powers of speech, and the energy
of ratiocination.

For the derivation of the word herald, we must look to the northern
languages. Its meaning in Junius, Skinner, and Minshieu, are various,
but not essentially different; they all seem to point out different
parts of the herald's office.

1\. In the Belgic, heer signifies army. Hence heer-alt, a senior
officer, or general, in the army.

2\. Or heer-held, the hero of the army: he who had distinguished himself
most in his country's behalf.

3\. Or from the Gallo-teutonic herr-haut, the high lord, because their
persons were so universally respected, as we have already seen.

4\. Or from the simple Teutonic herr-hold, he who is faithful to his
lord.

5\. And, lastly, according to Minshieu, from the verb hier-holden, stop
here; because, in proclaiming peace, they arrested bloodshed and death,
and prevented the farther progress of war.

These officers act an important part in all heroic history, and
particularly in the Iliad and Odyssey, from which, as the subject is of
so much importance, I shall make a few extracts.

I. Their character was sacred. Homer gives them the epithet of divine,
θειοι.

\- Δολων, Ευμηδεος υιος,

Κηρυκος θειοιο.

Iliad x. 315

"Dolon, son of Eumedes, the divine herald."

They were also termed inviolable, ασυλοι; also, great, admirable, etc.
In the first book of the Iliad, we have a proof of the respect paid to
heralds, and the inviolability of their persons. Agamemnon commands the
heralds, Talthybius and Eurybates, his faithful ministers, to go to the
tent of Achilles, seize the young Briseis, and bring her to him. They
reluctantly obey; but, when they come into the presence of Achilles,
knowing the injustice of their master's cause, they are afraid to
announce their mission. Achilles, guessing their errand, thus addresses
them: -

Χαιρετε, κηρυκες, Διος αγγελοι, ηδε και ανδρων. κ. τ. λ.

"Hail, O ye heralds, messengers of God and of men! come forward. I
cannot blame you - Agamemnon only is culpable, who has sent you for the
beautiful Briseis. But come, O godlike Patroclus, bring forth the
damsel, and deliver her to them, that they may lead her away," etc.,
Iliad i. 334, etc.

II\. Their functions were numerous; they might enter without danger into
besieged cities, or even into battles.

III\. They convoked the assemblies of the leaders, according to the
orders they received from the general or king.

IV\. They commanded silence, when kings were to address the assembly,
(Iliad xviii. 503. Κηρυκες δ' αρα λαων ερητυον. See also Iliad ii. 280),
and delivered the scepter into their hands, before they began their
harangue.

Ην δ' απα κηρυξ

Χερσι σκηπτρον εθηκε, σιωπησαι τ' εκελευσεν.

Iliad xxiii. 567

V. They were the carriers and executors of the royal commands, (Iliad i.
320), and went in search of those who were summoned to appear, or whose
presence was desired.

VI\. They were entrusted with the most important missions; and
accompanied princes in the most difficult circumstances. Priam, when he
went to Achilles, took no person besides a herald with him. (Iliad xxiv.
674, 689). When Ulysses sent two of his companions to treat with the
Lestrygons, he sent a herald at the same time. (Odys. x. 102).
Agamemnon, when he wished to soften Achilles, joined Eurybates and
Hodius, his heralds, to the deputation of the princes. (Iliad ix. 170).

VII\. Heralds were employed to proclaim and publish whatever was to be
known by the people. (Odys. xx. 276).

VIII\. They declared war and proclaimed peace. (Odys. xviii. 334).

IX\. They took part in all sacred ceremonies: they mingled the wine and
water in the large bowls for the libations, which were made at the
conclusion of treaties. They were the priests of the people in many
cases; they led forth the victims, cut them in pieces, and divided them
among those engaged in the sacrifices. (Odys. i. 109, etc).

X. In Odyssey lib. xvii., a herald presents a piece of flesh to
Telemachus, and pours out his wine.

XI\. They sometimes waited on princes at table, and rendered them many
other personal services. (Iliad ii. 280; Odys. i. 143, etc., 146, 153;
ii. 6, 38). In the Iliad, lib. x. 3, Eurybates carries the clothes to
Ulysses. And a herald of Alcinous conducts Demodocus, the singer, into
the festive hall. (Odys. viii. 470). Many others of their functions,
services, and privileges, the reader may see, by consulting Damm's
Homeric Lexicon, under Κρω.
