### [Daniel Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#001.md)

[Daniel](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">dan 10:0</span></span>

This and the two following chapters give an account of Daniel's last
vision, wherein the succession of the Persian and Grecian monarchies is
described, together with the wars that should take place between Syria
and Egypt under the latter monarchy. The last part of the vision (from
[Dan 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036).md) seems to relate chiefly to
the persecutions of the Church in the times of Antichrist, till it be
purified from all its pollutions; after which will follow that glorious
kingdom of the saints spoken of in the seventh and eighth chapters. This
chapter begins with an account of Daniel's fasting and humiliation, [Dan
10:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#001.md). Then we have a description of
the Divine person who appeared to the prophet, not unlike him who
appeared to the apostle in the isle of Patmos, vv. 4-21. See [Rev
1:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#010.md).

[Daniel 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">dan 10:1</span></span>

In the third year of Cyrus - Which answers to the first year of Darius
the Mede.

The time appointed was long - וצבא גדול vetsaba gadol, but the warfare
long; there will be many contentions and wars before these things can be
accomplished.

[Daniel 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">dan 10:2</span></span>

I - was mourning three full weeks - The weeks are most probably dated
from the time of the termination of the last vision. Calmet proves this
by several reasons.

[Daniel 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">dan 10:3</span></span>

I ate no pleasant bread - This fast was rather a general abstinence;
living all the while on coarse and unsavory food; drinking nothing but
water; not using the bath, and most probably wearing haircloth next the
skin, during the whole of the time.

[Daniel 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">dan 10:4</span></span>

By the side of - Hiddekel - The same as the Tigris. the great river of
Assyria; as the Euphrates of Syria, and the Nile of Egypt.

[Daniel 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">dan 10:5</span></span>

Clothed in linen - The description is intended to point out the splendor
of the garments.

Gold of Uphaz - The same as Ophir.

[Daniel 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">dan 10:6</span></span>

His body also was like the beryl - The description of this person is
very similar to that of our Lord in [Rev
1:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#013.md).

[Daniel 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">dan 10:7</span></span>

The men that were with me saw not the vision - An exactly parallel case
with what occurred at the conversion of Saul of Tarsus, [Act
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#007.md). There was a Divine influence
which they all felt, but only Daniel saw the corporeal appearance.

[Daniel 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">dan 10:9</span></span>

Was I in a deep sleep - I fell into a swoon.

[Daniel 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">dan 10:10</span></span>

A hand touched me - Nothing was apparent or palpable but a hand. A hand
had written Belshazzar's fate upon the wall; and the hand is frequently
mentioned when the power or majesty of God is intended. Perhaps by hand
God himself may be meant. It is remarkable that in a very ancient MS. of
the Septuagint, more than a thousand years old, now in the imperial
library of Vienna, adorned with paintings which have been engraved for
the catalogue of Lambechius, and transferred to that of Nesselius, all
the appearances of God are represented by a hand in the clouds.

[Daniel 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">dan 10:12</span></span>

I am come for thy words - On account of thy prayers I am sent to comfort
and instruct thee.

[Daniel 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">dan 10:13</span></span>

But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me - I think it would
go far to make a legend or a precarious tale of this important place to
endeavor to maintain that either a good or evil Angel Is intended here.
Cyrus alone was the prince of Persia, and God had destined him to be the
deliverer of his people; but there were some matters, of which we are
not informed, that caused him to hesitate for some time. Fearing,
probably, the greatness of the work, and not being fully satisfied of
his ability to execute it, he therefore for a time resisted the secret
inspirations which God had sent him. The opposition might be in
reference to the building of the temple.

But lo, Michael - Gabriel, who speaks, did not leave Cyrus till Michael
came to take his place. Michael, he who is like God, sometimes appears
to signify the Messiah, at other times the highest or chief archangel.
Indeed there is no archangel mentioned in the whole Scripture but this
one. See [Jde 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#009.md); [Rev
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#007.md).

[Daniel 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">dan 10:14</span></span>

For yet the vision is for many days - There are many things which remain
yet to be revealed, and the time of their accomplishment is very
distant.

[Daniel 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">dan 10:15</span></span>

I set my face toward the ground - He was standing upright, [Dan
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#011.md), and he now bent his body in
reverence, and looked down upon the ground.

And became dumb - Found himself unable to speak.

[Daniel 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">dan 10:16</span></span>

Like the similitude of the sons of men - I think Gabriel is here meant,
who appeared to Daniel in a human form; and so in [Dan
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#018.md), and see also [Dan
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#021.md).

Touched my lips - Before this he was unable to speak.

By the vision - The vision that I have already had, and of which I have
not a proper knowledge has greatly afflicted me, because I see it
intimates grievous calamities to my people. See [Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md).

[Daniel 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">dan 10:17</span></span>

Neither is there breath - He could not breathe freely; he was almost
suffocated with sorrow.

[Daniel 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">dan 10:19</span></span>

O man, greatly beloved - איש חמדות ish chamudoth, man of delights; the
most amiable of men.

Let my lord speak - I am now so strengthened and encouraged, that I
shall be able to bear any revelation that thou mayest make.

[Daniel 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">dan 10:20</span></span>

Knowest thou wherefore I come - So high art thou in the favor of God,
that he hath sent me unto thee to give thee farther satisfaction; though
I was elsewhere employed upon a most important mission, and I must
speedily return to accomplish it, viz.: -

To fight with the king of Persia - To remove all the scruples of Cyrus,
and to excite him to do all that God designs him to do for the
restoration of my people, and the rebuilding of the city and temple of
Jerusalem. Nothing less than a supernatural agency in the mind of Cyrus
can account for his decree in favor of the Jews. He had no natural, no
political inclination to it; and his reluctance to obey the heavenly
motions is here represented as a fight between him and the angel.

The prince of Grecia shall come - I believe this refers to Alexander the
Great, who was to destroy the Persian empire. See [Dan
11:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#002) (note.md).

[Daniel 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">dan 10:21</span></span>

Noted in the scripture of truth - Perhaps this refers to what he had
already written down. See the preceding visions, which Daniel did not
fully understand, though a general impression from them had filled his
heart with sorrow.

Michael your prince - The archangel mentioned before, [Dan
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#013.md), and who has been always
supposed to be appointed by God as the guardian of the Jewish nation. It
appears that God chose to make use of the ministry of angels in this
work; that angels, as they could be only in one place at one time, could
not produce influence where they were not; and that, to carry on the
operation on the mind of the Persian king, it was necessary that either
Gabriel or Michael should be present with him, and when one went on
another commission another took his place; see [Dan
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#013.md). But we know so little of the
invisible world that we cannot safely affirm any thing positively.
