### [Isaiah Chapter 57](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 57:0</span></span>

After mentioning the removal of righteous persons as an awful symptom of
the approach of Divine judgments, [Isa
57:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#001.md), [Isa
57:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#002.md), the prophet goes on to charge
the nation in general with idolatry, and with courting the unprofitable
alliance of idolatrous kings, [Isa
57:3-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#003.md). In opposition to such vain
confidence, the prophet enjoins trust in God, with whom the penitent and
humble are sure to find acceptance, and from whom they should obtain
temporal and spiritual deliverances, [Isa
57:13-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#013.md). Awful condition of the
wicked and finally impenitent, [Isa
57:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#020.md), [Isa
57:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#021.md).

I shall give Bishop Lowth's translation of the two first verses, and
give the substance of his criticisms with additional evidence.

[Isa 57:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#001.md). The righteous man
perisheth, and no one considereth;And pious men are taken away, and no
one understandeth,That the righteous man is taken away because of the
evil.

[Isa 57:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#002.md). He shall go in peace: he
shall rest in his bed;Even the perfect man: he that walketh in the
straight path.

[Isaiah 57:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 57:1</span></span>

The righteous perisheth - הצדק אבד hatstsadik abad. There is an emphasis
here which seems intended to point out a particular person. See below.
Perisheth - As the root אבד abad signifies the straying of cattle, their
passing away from one pasture to another, I feel inclined to follow the
grammatical meaning of the word "perish," pereo. So the Vulgate, justus
periit, from per, By or Through, and eo, to Go. In his death the
righteous man may be said to have passed through life, and to have
passed by men, i.e., gone or passed before them into the eternal world.
A similar mode of speech is used by our Saxon ancestors to express
death: he went out of sight; and he went away; and to fare forth, to
die.

There are very few places in Isaiah where Jesus Christ is not intended;
and I am inclined to think that He is intended here, That Just One; and
perhaps Stephen had this place in view, when he thus charged the Jews,
"Ye denied τον ἁγιον και δικαιον, that Holy and Just One," [Act
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#014.md). That his death was not laid to
heart by the wicked Jewish people, needs no proof.

Merciful men - If the first refers to Christ, this may well refer to the
apostles. and to others of the primitive Christians, who were taken
away, some by death and martyrdom, and others by a providential escape
from the city that they knew was devoted to destruction.

The evil to come - That destruction which was to come upon this
disobedient people by the Romans.

[Isaiah 57:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 57:2</span></span>

He shalt enter into peace "He shall go in peace" - יבוא שלום yabo
shalom; the expression is elliptical, such as the prophet frequently
uses. The same sense is expressed at large and in full terms, [Gen
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#015.md) : ואתה תבא אל אבותיך בשלום
veattah libbo al abotheycha beshalom, "and thou shalt go to thy fathers
in peace."

They shall rest in their beds, each one walking in his uprightness "He
shall rest in his bed; even the perfect man" - This obscure sentence is
reduced to a perfectly good sense, and easy construction by an ingenious
remark of Dr. Durell. He reads ינוח על משכבו תם yanuach al mishcabo tam,
"the perfect man shall rest in his bed." Two MSS. (one of them ancient)
have ינוח yanuach, singular; and so the Vulgate renders it, requiescat,
"he shall rest." The verb was probably altered to make it plural, and so
consistent with what follows after the mistake had been made in the
following words, by uniting משכבו mishcabo and תם tam into one word. See
Merrick's Annotations on the Psalms, Addenda; where the reader will find
that J. S. Moerlius, by the same sort of correction, and by rescuing the
adjective תם tam, which had been swallowed up in another word in the
same manner, has restored to a clear sense a passage before absolutely
unintelligible: -

למו חרצבות אין כי lemo chartsubboth ein ki :אולם ובריא תם ulam ubari
tham

"For no distresses happen to them;

Perfect and firm is their strength."

[Psa 73:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#004.md).

To follow on my application of this to our Lord: - He, the Just One,
shall enter into peace - the peaceable, prosperous possession of the
glorious mediatorial kingdom. They shall rest upon their beds - the hand
of wrong and oppression can reach these persecuted followers of Christ
no more. (But see below.) The perfect man walking in his uprightness.
This may be considered as a general declaration. The separated spirit,
though disunited from its body walking in conscious existence in the
paradise of God, reaping the fruit of righteousness. The word which we
render their beds, משכבותם mishkebotham, the learned bishop supposes to
be two words; and to be compounded of משכבו mishkabo, his bed, and תם
tam, the upright or perfect man. This is the reading both of the Syriac
and Vulgate, and it is favored by the Chaldee: and one of De Rossi's MS.
has משכבו mishkabo, his bed, without the word תם tam, which has been
added by a later hand. Bishop Lowth, as we have seen, adopts this
separation of the word and for ינוחו yanuchu, they shall rest, reads
ינוה yanuach, he shall rest, which is supported by two of Dr.
Kennicott's MSS., and by the Vulgate, Septuagint, and Arabic. The word
תם tam, taken from משכבותם mishkebotham, should begin the latter clause
of the verse; and then the interpolated words, each one, which our
translators supplied, may be very well spared. The verse may be then
read and paraphrased thus; -

He shall enter into peace: he shall rest upon his bed;

The perfect man walking in his uprightness.

The bed must signify the grave; the walking in uprightness after death,
the conscious existence of the happy spirit, and its eternal progression
in happiness and perfection: נכחו nechocho, straight before him;
proceeding into the unlimited extent of eternal glory, increasing in
happiness, and increasing in perfection.

My old MS. Bible translates very nervously: -

The rigtwise man perishith,

And there is not that bethinke in his herte.

And men of mercy ben gedrid,

For there is not that understonde:

From the face of malice,

Gedreid is the rigtwise.

Cumm pese: reste it in his bed

That geede in his rigt rewlinge.

It has been often remarked that, previously to the execution of God's
judgments upon a wicked place, he has removed good men from it, that
they might not suffer with the wicked. When great and good men are
removed by death, or otherwise, from any place, the remaining
inhabitants have much cause to tremble.

[Isaiah 57:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 57:6</span></span>

Among the smooth stones of the stream "Among the smooth stones of the
valley" - The Jews were extremely addicted to the practice of many
superstitious and idolatrous rites, which the prophet here inveighs
against with great vehemence. Of the worship of rude stones consecrated,
there are many testimonials of the ancients. They were called βαιτυλοι
and βαιτυλια· probably from the stone which Jacob erected at Beth-el,
pouring oil upon the top of it. This practice was very common in
different ages and places. Arnobius, lib. i., gives an account of his
own practice in this respect before he became a Christian: Si quando
conspexeram lubricatum lapidem, et ex olivi unguine sordidatum; tanquam
inesset vis praesens, adulabar, affabar, et beneficia poscebam nihil
sentiente de trunco. "When I have met with a smooth stone, smeared with
oil, supposing a spiritual power to be connected with it, I worshipped
it, paid my addresses to it, and requested blessings," etc. Clemens
Alex., Strom. lib. vii., speaks of a worshipper of every smooth stone in
a proverbial way, to denote one given up to superstition. And
accordingly Theophrastus has marked this as one strong feature in the
character of the superstitious man: Και των λιπαρων λιθων των εν ταις
τριοδοις παριων, εκ της ληκυθου ελαιου καταχειν, και επι γονατα πεσων
και προσκυνησας απαλλαττεσθαι. "Passing by the anointed stones in the
streets, he takes out his phial of oil, and pours it on them; and having
fallen on his knees, and made his adorations, he departs. "Kimchi says:
"When they found a beautiful polished stone in a brook or river, they
paid Divine adoration to it." This idolatry is still prevalent among the
Hindoos. The stone which is the object of their adoration is called
salgram. They are found about eighty miles from the source of the river
Sown, in the viceroyalty of Bahar, on the coast of Bengal. Ayeen Akbery
vol. 2 p. 29.

[Isaiah 57:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 57:8</span></span>

Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance
"Behind the door, and the door-posts, hast thou set up thy memorial" -
That is, the image of their tutelary gods, or something dedicated to
them; in direct opposition to the law of God, which commanded them to
write upon the door-posts of their house, and upon their gates, the
words of God's law; [Deu 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#009.md); [Deu
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#020.md). If they chose for them such a
situation as more private, it was in defiance of a particular curse
denounced in the law against the man who should make a graven or a
molten image, and put it in a secret place; [Deu
27:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#015.md). An ancient MS., with another,
has אחר achar, without the conjunction ו vau, and.

[Isaiah 57:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 57:9</span></span>

And thou wentest to the king with ointment "And thou hast visited the
king with a present of oil" - That is, the king of Assyria, or Egypt.
Hosea, chap, [Hos 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001.md), reproaches the
Israelites for the same practice: -

"They make a covenant with Assyria,

And oil is carried to Egypt."

It is well known, that in all parts of the east, whoever visits a great
person must carry him a present. "It is counted uncivil," says Maundreg,
p. 26, "to visit in this country without an offering in hand. All great
men expect it as a tribute due to their character and authority; and
look upon themselves as affronted, and indeed defrauded, when the
compliment is omitted." Hence שור shur, to visit a person, is equivalent
to making him a present; and תשורה teshurah signifies a present made on
such occasions; as our translators have rightly rendered it, [Sa1
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#007.md); on which Jarchi says Menachem
exponit תשורה teshurah, quod significat oblationem sive manus, ut
aliquis aspiciat faciem regis, aut alicuius magnatis. "Menachem expounds
תשורה teshurah of an offering or gift which is presented in order to be
admitted into the presence of the king or some great man."

[Isaiah 57:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 57:10</span></span>

Yet saidst thou not, There is no hope "Thou hast said, There is hope" -
In one of the MSS. at Koningsberg, collated by Lilienthal, the words לא
אמרת lo amarta, are left in the text unpointed, as suspected; and in the
margin the corrector has written ותאמרי vattomari. Now if we compare
[Jer 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#025.md) and [Jer
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#012.md), we shall find that the subject
is in both places quite the same with this of Isaiah; and the sentiment
expressed, that of a desperate resolution to continue at all hazards in
their idolatrous practices; the very thing that in all reason we might
expect here. Probably, therefore, the latter is the true reading in this
place. - L.

[Isaiah 57:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 57:11</span></span>

For laid it to thy heart "Nor revolved it in thy hand" - Eight MSS.,
(four ancient), and the two oldest editions, with another, add the
conjunction ו vau, ולא velo: which is confirmed by all the ancient
Versions.

Even of old "And winked" - For ומעולם umeolam, which makes no good sense
or construction in this place, twenty-three MSS. (seven ancient) and
three editions have מעלם, (to be thus pointed מעלם malim); Παρορω,
Septuagint; quasi non videns, "as if not seeing," Vulgate. See [Psa
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#001.md). The truth of this reading, so
confirmed, admits of no doubt. In one of my own MSS. the ו vau has been
written, but afterwards struck out. Is it not because I was silent, and
winked?

[Isaiah 57:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 57:12</span></span>

Thy righteousness "My righteousness" - For צדקתך tsidkathech, Thy
righteousness, the Syriac, Septuagint, MSS. Alex. and Pachom., and 1. D.
II., and Marchal. and οἱ Γ, and the Arabics read צדקי tsidki, My
righteousness.

[Isaiah 57:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 57:13</span></span>

Let thy companies deliver thee "Let thine associates deliver thee" -
Thirty-nine MSS. (ten ancient) of Dr. Kennicott's, and two of my own,
and the two oldest editions have יצילכו yatstsiluchu, plural.

[Isaiah 57:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 57:14</span></span>

And shall say "Then will I say" - ואמר vaomer, to be pointed as the
first person future. They are the words of God, as it is plain from the
conclusion of the verse; my people, עמי ammi.

[Isaiah 57:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 57:15</span></span>

For thus saith the high and lofty One "For thus saith Jehovah, the high
and the lofty" - A MS. adds יהוה Yehovah, after אמר amar, and edition
Prag. 1518. So the Septuagint, Alex., and Arabic. An ancient MS. adds יה
Yah.

With him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit - Twelve MSS. have
את eth, without the conjunction ו vau. Pro ואת veeth, forte legendum
ואראה veerah: confer [Psa 113:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#005.md), et
[Psa 138:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#006.md). - Secker. "We should
perhaps read ואראה veerah, instead of ואת veeth. See [Psa
113:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#005.md), and [Psa
138:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#006.md)."

[Isaiah 57:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 57:16</span></span>

For I will not contend for ever - The learned have taken a great deal of
pains to little purpose on the latter part of this verses which they
suppose to be very obscure. After all their labors upon it, I think the
best and easiest explication of it is given in the two following elegant
passages of the Psalms, which I presume are exactly parallel to it, and
very clearly express the same sentiment.

"But he in his tender mercy will forgive their sin

And will not destroy them;

Yea, oftentimes will he turn away his wrath,

And will not rouse up his indignation:

For he remembereth that they are but flesh,

A breath that passeth, and returneth not."

[Psa 78:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#038.md), [Psa
78:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#039.md).

"He will not always contend

Neither will he for ever hold his wrath:

As a father yearneth towards his children,

So is Jehovah tenderly compassionate towards them

that fear him For he knoweth our frame;

He remembereth that we are but dust."

[Psa 103:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#009.md), [Psa
103:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#013.md), [Psa
103:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#014.md).

In the former of these two passages the second line seems to be
defective both in measure and sense. I suppose the word אותם otham, then
is lost at the end; which seems to be acknowledged by the Chaldee and
Vulgate, who render as if they had read ולא ישחית אותם velo yaschith
otham. - L.

For the spirit - רוח ruach, the animal life.

And the souls - נשמות neshamoth, the immortal spirits. The Targum
understands this of the resurrection. I will restore the souls of the
dead, i.e., to their bodies.

[Isaiah 57:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 57:17</span></span>

For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth "Because of his
iniquity for a short time was I wroth" - For בצעו bitso, I read בצע
betsa, a little while, from בצע batsa, he cut of, as the Septuagint read
and render it, βραχυ τι, "a certain short space." Propter iniquitatem
avaritiae ejus, "because of the iniquity of his avarice," the rendering
of the Vulgate, which our translators and I believe all others follow,
is surely quite beside the purpose.

[Isaiah 57:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 57:18</span></span>

I have seen his ways - Probably these verses refer to the restoration of
the Jews from captivity.

[Isaiah 57:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 57:19</span></span>

I create the fruit of the lips - "The sacrifice of praise," saith St.
Paul, [Heb 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015.md), "is the fruit of the
lips." God creates this fruit of the lips, by giving new subject and
cause of thanksgiving by his mercies conferred on those among his
people, who acknowledge and bewail their transgressions, and return to
him. The great subject of thanksgiving is peace, reconciliation and
pardon, offered to them that are nigh, and to them that are afar off,
not only to the Jew, but also to the Gentile, as St. Paul more than once
applies those terms, [Eph 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#013.md), [Eph
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#017.md). See also [Act
2:39](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#039.md).

Peace to him that is far off "That is, to the penitent; and to him that
is near, i.e., the righteous." - Kimchi.

[Isaiah 57:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 57:21</span></span>

There is no peace, saith my God - For אלהי Elohai, twenty-two MSS. (five
ancient) of Kennicott's, thirty of De Rossi's, and one ancient of my
own, read יהוה Yehovah; the Vulgate, Septuagint, Alex., and Arabic, and
three MSS. have both. This verse has reference to the nineteenth. The
perseveringly wicked and impenitent are excluded from all share in that
peace above mentioned, that reconcilement and pardon which is promised
to the penitent only. The forty-eighth chapter ends with the same
declaration, to express the exclusion of the unbelievers and impenitent
from the benefit of the foregoing promises. - L.
