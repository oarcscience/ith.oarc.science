### [Ezekiel Chapter 45](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 45:0</span></span>

The several portions of land appointed for the sanctuary, [Eze
45:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#001.md), the city, 6, and the prince,
[Eze 45:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#007.md), [Eze
45:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#008.md). Regulations concerning the
weights and measures, [Eze 45:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#009.md);
with ordinances respecting the provisions for the ordinary and
extraordinary sacrifices, [Eze
45:13-25](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#013.md).

[Ezekiel 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 45:1</span></span>

When ye shall divide by lot - That is, when on your repossessing your
land, every family settles according to the allotment which they
formerly had; for it is certain that the land was not divided afresh by
lot after the Babylonish captivity. The allotment mentioned and
described here was merely for the service of the temple, the use of the
priests, and the prince or governor of the people. A division of the
whole land is not intended.

[Ezekiel 45:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 45:2</span></span>

Of this there shall be for the sanctuary - See the plan, A.

[Ezekiel 45:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 45:3</span></span>

And of this measure - See the plan, A, B, C, D, E.

[Ezekiel 45:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 45:4</span></span>

The holy portion - See the plan, A.

[Ezekiel 45:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 45:5</span></span>

And the five and twenty thousand - See the plan, B.

[Ezekiel 45:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 45:6</span></span>

Ye shall appoint - See the plan, FF.

[Ezekiel 45:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 45:7</span></span>

A portion shall be for the prince - נשיא nasi, he who had the authority
of chief magistrate; for there was neither king nor prince among the
Jews after the Babylonish captivity. For these allotments and divisions,
see the plan, EE, FF, GG.

[Ezekiel 45:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 45:8</span></span>

My princes shall no more oppress my people - By exorbitant taxes to
maintain profligate courts, or subsidize other powers to help to keep up
a system of tyranny in the earth. The former princes even robbed the
temple of God to give subsidies to other states.

[Ezekiel 45:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 45:9</span></span>

Take away your exactions from my people - This is the voice of God to
all the rulers of the earth.

Take away your exactions; do not oppress the people; they are mine.
Abolish all oppressive taxes.

[Ezekiel 45:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 45:10</span></span>

Ye shall have just balances - This appreciation of weights, measures,
and money was intended to show them that they must not introduce those
to which they had been accustomed in the captivity, but those which God
had prescribed to their forefathers. See the notes on the parallel
places.

[Ezekiel 45:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 45:16</span></span>

All - this oblation for the prince - A present or offering to the
prince.

[Ezekiel 45:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 45:18</span></span>

Thou shalt take a young bullock - and cleanse the sanctuary - There is
nothing of this in the Mosaic law; it seems to have been a new ceremony.
An annual purification of the sanctuary may be intended.

[Ezekiel 45:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 45:20</span></span>

For him that is simple - That wants understanding to conduct himself
properly.

[Ezekiel 45:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 45:25</span></span>

In the seventh month - He shall do at the feast of tabernacles the same
things that he was desired to do on the passover. The prince should
offer the same number of victims, of the same quality, and with the same
ceremonies, as during the above seven days. The offerings were,
sin-offerings, burnt-offerings, and peace-offerings.
