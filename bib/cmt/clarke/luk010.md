### [Luke Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001.md)

[Luke](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">luk 10:0</span></span>

Christ appoints seventy disciples to go before him, two by two, to
preach, heal, etc., [Luk 10:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001.md).
Pronounces woes on Chorazin and Capernaum, [Luk
10:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#013.md). The seventy return, and give
account of their mission, [Luk
10:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#017.md). Christ rejoices that the
things which were hidden from the wise and prudent had been revealed
unto babes, and shows the great privileges of the Gospel, [Luk
10:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#021.md). A lawyer inquires how he
shall inherit eternal life, and is answered, [Luk
10:25-29](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#025.md). The story of the good
Samaritan, [Luk 10:30-37](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#030.md). The account
of Martha and Mary, [Luk 10:38-42](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#038.md).

[Luke 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 10:1</span></span>

The Lord appointed other seventy - Rather, seventy others, not other
seventy, as our translation has it, which seems to intimate that he had
appointed seventy before this time, though, probably, the word other has
a reference to the twelve chosen first: he not only chose twelve
disciples to be constantly with him; but he chose seventy others to go
before him. Our blessed Lord formed every thing in his Church on the
model of the Jewish Church; and why? Because it was the pattern shown by
God himself, the Divine form, which pointed out the heavenly substance
which now began to be established in its place. As he before had chosen
twelve apostles, in reference to the twelve patriarchs, who were the
chiefs of the twelve tribes, and the heads of the Jewish Church, he now
publicly appointed (for so the word ανεδειξεν means) seventy others, as
Moses did the seventy elders whom he associated with himself to assist
him in the government of the people. [Exo
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#019.md); [Exo
24:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#001.md). These Christ sent by two and
two:

1\. To teach them the necessity of concord among the ministers of
righteousness.

2\. That in the mouths of two witnesses every thing might be
established. And,

3\. That they might comfort and support each other in their difficult
labor. See on [Mar 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#007) (note.md).

Several MSS. and versions have seventy-two. Sometimes the Jews chose six
out of each tribe: this was the number of the great Sanhedrin. The names
of these seventy disciples are found in the margin of some ancient MSS.,
but this authority is questionable.

[Luke 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 10:2</span></span>

That he would send forth - Εκβαλῃ. There seems to be an allusion here to
the case of reapers, who, though the harvest was perfectly ripe, yet
were in no hurry to cut it down. News of this is brought to the Lord of
the harvest the farmer, and he is entreated to exert his authority, and
hurry them out; and this he does because the harvest is spoiling for
want of being reaped and gathered in. See the notes on [Mat
9:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#037.md), [Mat
9:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#038.md).

[Luke 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 10:3</span></span>

Lambs among wolves - See on [Mat 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016.md)
(note).

[Luke 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 10:4</span></span>

Carry neither purse nor scrip - See on [Mat
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#009) (note.md), etc., and [Mar
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#008) (note.md), etc.

Salute no man by the way - According to a canon of the Jews, a man who
was about any sacred work was exempted from all civil obligations for
the time; forasmuch as obedience to God was of infinitely greater
consequence than the cultivation of private friendships, or the
returning of civil compliments.

[Luke 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 10:5</span></span>

Peace be to this house - See on [Mat
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#012) (note.md).

[Luke 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 10:6</span></span>

The son of peace - In the Jewish style, a man who has any good or bad
quality is called the son of it. Thus, wise men are called the children
of wisdom, [Mat 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#019.md); [Luk
7:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#035.md). So, likewise, what a man is
doomed to, he is called the son of, as in [Eph
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#003.md), wicked men are styled the
children of wrath: so Judas is called the son of perdition, [Joh
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#012.md); and a man who deserves to die
is called, [Sa2 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#005.md), a son of death.
Son of peace in the text not only means a peaceable, quiet man, but one
also of good report for his uprightness and benevolence. It would have
been a dishonor to this mission, had the missionaries taken up their
lodgings with those who had not a good report among them who were
without.

[Luke 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 10:7</span></span>

The laborer is worthy - See on [Mat
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#008.md), [Mat
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#012) (note.md).

Go not from house to house - See on [Mat
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#011) (note.md). It would be a great
offense among the Hindoos if a guest, after being made welcome at a
house, were to leave it and go to another.

[Luke 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 10:9</span></span>

The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you - Εφ ὑμας, is just upon you.
This was the general text on which they were to preach all their
sermons. See it explained, [Mat 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md)
(note).

[Luke 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 10:11</span></span>

Even the very dust of your city - See on [Mat
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#014.md), [Mat
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#015) (note.md).

[Luke 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 10:13</span></span>

Wo unto thee, Chorazin! - See on [Mat
11:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#021) (note.md).

[Luke 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 10:15</span></span>

To hell - To hades. See this explained, [Mat
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#023) (note.md).

[Luke 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 10:16</span></span>

He that despiseth you, despiseth me - "The holy, blessed God said:
'Honor my statutes, for they are my ambassadors: and a man's ambassador
is like to himself. If thou honor my precepts, it is the same as if thou
didst honor me; and if thou despise them, thou despisest me." R. Tancum.
"He that murmurs against his teacher is the same as if he had murmured
against the Divine Shekinah." Sanhedrin, fol. 110.

[Luke 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 10:17</span></span>

The seventy returned again with joy - Bishop Pearce thinks they returned
while our Lord was on his slow journey to Jerusalem, and that they had
been absent only a few days.

[Luke 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 10:18</span></span>

I beheld Satan - Or, Satan himself, τον Σαταναν, the very Satan, the
supreme adversary, falling as lightning, with the utmost suddenness, as
a flash of lightning falls from the clouds, and at the same time in the
most observable manner. The fall was both very sudden and very apparent.
Thus should the fall of the corrupt Jewish state be, and thus was the
fall of idolatry in the Gentile world.

[Luke 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 10:19</span></span>

To tread on serpents, etc. - It is possible that by serpents and
scorpions our Lord means the scribes and Pharisees, whom he calls
serpents and a brood of vipers, [Mat
23:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#033), (see the note there.md), because,
through the subtilty and venom of the old serpent, the devil, they
opposed him and his doctrine; and, by trampling on these, it is likely
that he means, they should get a complete victory over such: as it was
an ancient custom to trample on the kings and generals who had been
taken in battle, to signify the complete conquest which had been gained
over them. See [Jos 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#024.md). See also
[Rom 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#020.md). See the notes on [Mar
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#017.md), [Mar
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#018.md).

[Luke 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 10:20</span></span>

Because your names are written in heaven - This form of speech is taken
from the ancient custom of writing the names of all the citizens in a
public register, that the several families might be known, and the
inheritances properly preserved. This custom is still observed even in
these kingdoms, though not particularly noticed. Every child that is
born in the land is ordered to be registered, with the names of its
parents, and the time when born, baptized, or registered; and this
register is generally kept in the parish church, or in some public place
of safety. Such a register as this is called in [Phi
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#003.md); [Rev
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#005.md), etc., the book of life, i.e. the
book or register where the persons were enrolled as they came into life.
It appears also probable, that when any person died, or behaved
improperly, his name was sought out and erased from the book, to prevent
any confusion that might happen in consequence of improper persons
laying claim to an estate, and to cut off the unworthy from the rights
and privileges of the peaceable, upright citizens. To this custom of
blotting the names of deceased and disorderly persons out of the public
registers, there appear to be allusions, [Exo
32:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032.md), where see the note; and [Rev
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#005.md); [Deu
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#014.md); [Deu
25:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#019.md); [Deu
29:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#020.md); [Kg2
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#027.md); [Psa
69:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#028.md); [Psa
109:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#013.md), and in other places.

[Luke 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 10:21</span></span>

Rejoiced in spirit - Was truly and heartily joyous: felt an inward
triumph. But τῳ πνευματι, τῳ ἁγιῳ, the Holy Spirit, is the reading here
of BCDKL, six others; the three Syriac, later Persic, Coptic, Ethiopic,
Armenian, Vulgate, all the Itala except one, and Augustin and Bede.
These might be considered sufficient authority to admit the word into
the text.

I thank thee - Bishop Pearce justly observes, the thanks are meant to be
given to God for revealing them to babes, not for hiding them from the
others. See on [Mat 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025) (note.md).

Thou hast hid - That is, thou hast not revealed them to the scribes and
Pharisees, who idolized their own wisdom; but thou hast revealed them to
the simple and humble of heart.

[Luke 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 10:22</span></span>

The Codex Alexandrinus, several other very ancient MSS., and some
ancient versions, as well as the margin of our own, begin this verse
with, And turning to his disciples, he said. But as this clause begins
[Luk 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#023.md), it is not likely that it
was originally in both. Griesbach has left these words out of the text,
and Professor White says, Certissime delenda, "These words should most
assuredly be erased."

All things are delivered to me - See on [Mat
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#027) (note.md).

[Luke 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 10:23</span></span>

Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see - There is a
similar saying to this among the rabbins, in Sohar. Genes., where it is
said, "Blessed is that generation which the earth shall bear, when the
King Messiah cometh."

[Luke 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 10:24</span></span>

Many prophets - See on [Mat 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#011.md),
[Mat 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#017) (note.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 10:25</span></span>

A certain lawyer - See on [Mat 22:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#035.md)
(note).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 10:27</span></span>

Thou shalt love the Lord - See this important subject explained at
large, on [Mat 22:37-40](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#037) (note.md).

Thy neighbor as thyself - See the nature of self-love explained, on [Mat
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#019) (note.md).

[Luke 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 10:29</span></span>

Willing to justify himself - Wishing to make it appear that he was a
righteous man, and that consequently he was in the straight road to the
kingdom of God, said, Who is my neighbor? supposing our Lord would have
at once answered, "Every Jew is to be considered as such, and the Jews
only." Now as he imagined he had never been deficient in his conduct to
any person of his own nation, he thought he had amply fulfilled the law.
This is the sense in which the Jews understood the word neighbor, as may
be seen from [Lev 19:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#015.md). But our
Lord shows here, that the acts of kindness which a man is bound to
perform to his neighbor when in distress, he should perform to any
person, of whatever nation, religion, or kindred, whom he finds in
necessity. As the word πλησιον signifies one who is near, Anglo Saxon,
he that is next, this very circumstance makes any person our neighbor
whom we know; and, if in distress, an object of our most compassionate
regards. If a man came from the most distant part of the earth, the
moment he is near you he has a claim upon your mercy and kindness, as
you would have on his, were your dwelling-place transferred to his
native country. It is evident that our Lord uses the word πλησιον (very
properly translated neighbor, from nae or naer, near, and buer, to
dwell) in its plain, literal sense. Any person whom you know, who dwells
hard by, or who passes near you, is your neighbor while within your
reach.

[Luke 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">luk 10:30</span></span>

And Jesus answering - Rather, Then Jesus took him up. This I believe to
be the meaning of the word ὑπολαβων; he threw out a challenge, and our
Lord took him up on his own ground. See Wakefield's Testament.

A certain man went down from Jerusalem - Or, A certain man of Jerusalem
going down to Jericho. This was the most public road in all Judea, as it
was the grand thoroughfare between these two cities for the courses of
priests, twelve thousand of whom are said to have resided at Jericho.
See Lightfoot.

Fell among thieves - At this time the whole land of Judea was much
infested with hordes of banditti; and it is not unlikely that many
robberies might have been committed on that very road to which our Lord
refers.

[Luke 10:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 10:31</span></span>

And by chance - Κατα συγκυριαν properly means the coincidence of time
and circumstance. At the time in which the poor Jew was half dead,
through the wounds which he had received, a priest came where he was. So
the priest's coming while the man was in that state is the coincidence
marked out by the original words.

Priest and Levite are mentioned here, partly because they were the most
frequent travelers on this road, and partly to show that these were the
persons who, from the nature of their office, were most obliged to
perform works of mercy; and from whom a person in distress had a right
to expect immediate succor and comfort; and their inhuman conduct here
was a flat breach of the law, [Deu
22:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#001.md).

[Luke 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 10:33</span></span>

Samaritan is mentioned merely to show that he was a person from whom a
Jew had no right to expect any help or relief, because of the enmity
which subsisted between the two nations.

[Luke 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 10:34</span></span>

Pouring in oil and wine - These, beaten together, appear to have been
used formerly as a common medicine for fresh wounds. Bind up a fresh cut
immediately in a soft rag or lint, moistened with pure olive oil, and
the parts will heal by what is called the first intention, and more
speedily than by any other means.

An inn - Πανδοχειον, from παν, all, and δεχομαι, I receive; because it
receives all comers.

[Luke 10:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">luk 10:35</span></span>

Two pence - Two denarii, about fifteen pence, English; and which,
probably, were at that time of ten times more value there than so much
is with us now.

[Luke 10:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 10:36</span></span>

Which - was neighbor - Which fulfilled the duty which one neighbor owes
to another?

[Luke 10:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 10:37</span></span>

He that showed mercy - Or, so much mercy. His prejudice would not permit
him to name the Samaritan, yet his conscience obliged him to acknowledge
that he was the only righteous person of the three.

Go, and do thou likewise - Be even to thy enemy in distress as kind,
humane, and merciful, as this Samaritan was. As the distress was on the
part of a Jew, and the relief was afforded by a Samaritan, the lawyer,
to be consistent with the decision he had already given, must feel the
force of our Lord's inference, that it was his duty to act to any
person, of whatever nation or religion he might be, as this Samaritan
had acted toward his countryman. It is very likely that what our Lord
relates here was a real matter of fact, and not a parable; otherwise the
captious lawyer might have objected that no such case had ever existed,
and that any inference drawn from it was only begging the question; but
as he was, in all probability, in possession of the fact himself, he was
forced to acknowledge the propriety of our Lord's inference and advice.

Those who are determined to find something allegorical, even in the
plainest portions of Scripture, affirm that the whole of this relation
is to be allegorically considered; and, according to them, the following
is the true exposition of the text.

The certain man means Adam - went down, his fall - from Jerusalem, יראה
שלום yorih shalom, he shall see peace, perfection, etc., meaning his
state of primitive innocence and excellence - to Jericho, (ירחי
yareacho, his moon), the transitory and changeable state of existence in
this world - thieves, sin and Satan - stripped, took away his
righteousness, which was the clothing of the soul - wounded, infected
his heart with all evil and hurtful desires, which are the wounds of the
spirit - half dead, possessing a living body, carrying about a soul dead
in sin.

The priest, the moral law - the Levite, the ceremonial law - passed by,
either could not or would not afford any relief, because by the law is
the knowledge of sin, not the cure of it. A certain Samaritan, Christ;
for so he was called by the Jews, [Joh
8:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#048.md) - as he journeyed, meaning his
coming from heaven to earth; his being incarnated - came where he was,
put himself in man's place, and bore the punishment due to his sins -
had compassion, it is through the love and compassion of Christ that the
work of redemption was accomplished - went to him, Christ first seeks
the sinner, who, through his miserable estate, is incapable of seeking
or going to Christ - bound up his wounds, gives him comfortable
promises, and draws him by his love - pouring in oil, pardoning mercy -
wine, the consolations of the Holy Ghost - set him on his own beast,
supported him entirely by his grace and goodness, so that he no longer
lives, but Christ lives in him - took him to an inn, his Church, uniting
him with his people - took care of him, placed him under the continual
notice of his providence and love - when he departed, when he left the
world and ascended to the Father - took out two pence, or denarii, the
law and the Gospel; the one to convince of sin, the other to show how it
is to be removed - gave them to the host, the ministers of the Gospel
for the edification of the Church of Christ - take care of him, as they
are Gods watchmen and God's stewards, they are to watch over the flock
of Christ, and give to each his portion of meat in due season. What thou
spendest more, if thou shouldst lose thy health and life in this work -
when I come again, to judge the world, I will repay thee, I will reward
thee with an eternity of glory.

Several primitive and modern fathers treat the text in this way. What I
have given before is, I believe, the meaning of our blessed Lord. What I
have given here is generally true in itself, but certainly does not
follow from the text. Mr. Baxter's note here is good: "They who make the
wounded man Adam, and the good Samaritan Christ, abuse the passage." A
practice of this kind cannot be too strongly reprehended. Men may take
that advantage of the circumstances of the case to illustrate the above
facts and doctrines; but let no man say this is the meaning of the
relation; no: but he may say, we may make this use of it. Though I
cannot recommend this kind of preaching, yet I know that some simple
upright souls have been edified by it. I dare not forbid a man to work
by whom God may choose to work a miracle, because he follows not with
us. But such a mode of interpretation I can never recommend.

[Luke 10:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">luk 10:38</span></span>

A certain village - If this village was Bethany, where Martha and Mary
lived, at less than two miles' distance from Jerusalem, see [Joh
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#001.md), [Joh
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#018.md); [Joh
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#002.md), then this must have happened
later than Luke places it; because, in [Luk
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#029.md), he represents Jesus as having
arrived after this at Bethany; and what is said in [Luk
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#022.md), and [Luk
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#011.md), seems to confirm that this
visit of Jesus to Martha and Mary ought to be placed later. Bishop
Pearce.

Received him - Kindly received, ὑπεδεξατο, she received him in a
friendly manner, under her roof; and entertained him hospitably. So the
word is used in the best Greek writers. Martha is supposed by some to
have been a widow, with whom her brother Lazarus and sister Mary lodged.

Sat at Jesus' feet - This was the posture of the Jewish scholars, while
listening to the instructions of the rabbins. It is in this sense that
St. Paul says he was brought up at the Feet of Gamaliel, [Act
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#003.md).

Martha was cumbered - Περιεσπατο, perplexed, from περι, about, and σπαω,
I draw. She was harassed with different cares and employments at the
same time; one drawing one way, and another, another: a proper
description of a worldly mind. But in Martha's favor it may be justly
said, that all her anxiety was to provide suitable and timely
entertainment for our Lord and his disciples; for this is the sense in
which the word διακονιαν, serving, should be taken. And we should not,
on the merest supposition, attribute earthly-mindedness to a woman whose
character stands unimpeachable in the Gospel; and who, by entertaining
Christ and his disciples, and providing liberally for them, gave the
highest proof that she was influenced by liberality and benevolence, and
not by parsimony or covetousness.

Dost thou not care - Dost thou not think it wrong, that my sister thus
leaves me to provide and prepare this supper, alone?

Help me - Συναντιλαβηται, from συν, together, and αντιλαμβανομαι, to
support. The idea is taken from two pillars meeting together at the top,
exactly over the center of the distance between their bases, and thus
mutually supporting each other. Order her to unite her skill and
strength with mine, that the present business may be done with that
speed and in that order which the necessity and importance of the case
demand.

[Luke 10:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">luk 10:41</span></span>

Thou art careful and troubled - Thou art distracted, μεριμνας, thy mind
is divided, (see on [Mat 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#022.md)
(note)), in consequence of which, τυρβαζῃ, thou art disturbed, thy
spirit is thrown into a tumult.

About many things - Getting a variety of things ready for this
entertainment, much more than are necessary on such an occasion.

[Luke 10:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">luk 10:42</span></span>

One thing is needful - This is the end of the sentence, according to
Bengel. "Now Mary hath chosen, etc.," begins a new one. One single dish,
the simplest and plainest possible, is such as best suits me and my
disciples, whose meat and drink it is to do the will of our heavenly
Father.

Mary hath chosen that good part - That is, of hearing my word, of which
she shall not be deprived; it being at present of infinitely greater
importance to attend to my teaching than to attend to any domestic
concerns. While thou art busily employed in providing that portion of
perishing food for perishing bodies, Mary has chosen that spiritual
portion which endures for ever, and which shall not be taken away from
her; therefore I cannot command her to leave her present employment, and
go and help thee to bring forward a variety of matters, which are by no
means necessary at this time. Our Lord both preached and practised the
doctrine of self-denial; he and his disciples were contented with a
little, and sumptuous entertainments are condemned by the spirit and
design of his Gospel.

Multos morbos, multa fercula fecerunt.

Seneca.

"Many dishes, many diseases."

Bishop Pearce remarks that the word χρεια, needful, is used after the
same manner for want of food in [Mar
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#025.md), where of David it is said,
χρειαν εσχε, he had need, when it means he was hungry. I believe the
above to be the true meaning of these verses; but others have taken a
somewhat different sense from them: especially when they suppose that by
one thing needful our Lord means the salvation of the soul. To attend to
this is undoubtedly the most necessary of all things, and should be the
first, the grand concern of every human spirit; but in my opinion it is
not the meaning of the words in the text. It is only prejudice from the
common use of the words in this way that could make such an
interpretation tolerable. Kypke in loc. has several methods of
interpreting this passage. Many eminent commentators, both ancient and
modern, consider the text in the same way I have done. But this is
termed by some, "a frigid method of explaining the passage;" well, so
let it be; but he that fears God will sacrifice every thing at the
shrine of Truth. I believe this alone to be the true meaning o the
place, and I dare not give it any other. Bengelius points the whole
passage thus: Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many
things: but one thing is needful. Now, Mary hath chosen that good
portion, which shall not be taken away from her.

That the salvation of the soul is the first and greatest of all human
concerns, every man must acknowledge who feels that he has a soul; and
in humility of mind to hear Jesus, is the only way of getting that
acquaintance with the doctrine of salvation without which how can he be
saved? While we fancy we are in no spiritual necessity, the things which
concern salvation will not appear needful to us! A conviction that we
are spiritually poor must precede our application for the true riches.
The whole, says Christ, need not the physician, but those who are sick.
Martha has been blamed, by incautious people, as possessing a carnal,
worldly spirit; and as Mary Magdalene has been made the chief of all
prostitutes, so has Martha of all the worldly-minded. Through her
affectionate respect for our Lord and his disciples, and through that
alone, she erred. There is not the slightest intimation that she was
either worldly-minded or careless about her soul; nor was she at this
time improperly employed, only so far as the abundance of her affection
led her to make a greater provision than was necessary on the occasion.
Nor are our Lord's words to be understood as a reproof; they are a kind
and tender expostulation, tending to vindicate the conduct of Mary. The
utmost that can be said on the subject is, Martha was well employed, but
Mary, on this occasion, better.

If we attend to the punctuation of the original text, the subject will
appear more plain. I shall transcribe the text from Bengel's own
edition, Stutgardiae, 1734, 12 mo. [Luk
10:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#041.md), [Luk
10:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#042.md). [Luk
10:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#041.md), αποκριθεις δε ειπεν αυτῃ ὁ
Ιησους, Μαρθα, Μαρθα, μεριμνᾳς και τυρβαζῃ περι πολλα· ἑνος δε εϚι
χρεια. Μαρια δε την αγαθην μεριδα εξελεξατο, ἡτις ουκ αφαιρεθησεται απ'
αυτης. "Then Jesus answered her, Martha, Martha, thou art anxiously
careful and disturbed about many things; but one thing is necessary. But
Mary hath chosen that good portion which shall not be taken away from
her." I have shown, in my notes, that Martha was making a greater
provision for her guests than was needful; that it was in consequence of
this that she required her sister's help; that Jesus tenderly reproved
her for her unnecessary anxiety and superabundant provision, and
asserted that but one thing, call it course or dish, was necessary on
the occasion, yet she had provided many; and that this needless
provision was the cause of the anxiety and extra labor. Then, taking
occasion, from the circumstances of the case, to vindicate Mary's
conduct, and to direct his loving reproof more pointedly at Martha's
heart, he adds, Mary hath chosen a good portion; that is, she avails
herself of the present opportunity to hear my teaching, and inform
herself in those things which are essential to the salvation of the
soul. I cannot, therefore, order her to leave my teaching, to serve in
what I know to be an unnecessary service, however kindly designed: for
it would be as unjust to deprive her of this bread of life, after which
she so earnestly hungers, as to deprive thee, or thy guests, of that
measure of common food necessary to sustain life. All earthly portions
are perishing: "Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats, but God
will destroy both it and then; but the work of the Lord abideth for
ever;" her portion, therefore, shall not be taken away from her. This is
my view of the whole subject; and all the terms in the original, not
only countenance this meaning, but necessarily require it. The words,
one thing is needful, on which we lay so much stress, are wanting in
some of the most ancient MSS., and are omitted by some of the fathers,
who quote all the rest of the passage: a plain proof that the meaning
which we take out of them was not thought of in very ancient times; and
in other MSS., versions, and fathers, there is an unusual variety of
readings where even the thing, or something like it, is retained. Some
have it thus; Martha, Martha, thou labourest much, and yet a little is
sufficient, yea, one thing only. Others: And only one thing is required.
Others: Thou art curious and embarrassed about many things, when that
which is needful is very small. Others: But here there need only a few
things. Others: But a few things, or one only, is necessary. Now these
are the readings of almost all the ancient versions; and we plainly
perceive, by them, that what we term the one thing needful, is not
understood by one of them as referring to the salvation of the soul, but
to the provision Then to be made. It would be easy to multiply
authorities, but I spare both my own time and that of my reader. In
short, I wonder how the present most exceptionable mode of
interpretation ever obtained; as having no countenance in the text,
ancient MSS. or versions, and as being false in itself; for even Christ
himself could not say, that sitting at his feet, and hearing his word,
was the One thing Needful. Repentance, faith, prayer, obedience, and a
thousand other things are necessary to our salvation, besides merely
hearing the doctrines of Christ, even with the humblest heart.
