### [Job Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#001.md)

[Job](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">job 33:0</span></span>

Elihu offers himself in God's stead to reason with Job in meekness and
sincerity, [Job 33:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#001.md). Charges Job
with irreverent expressions, [Job
33:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#008.md). Vindicates the providence of
God, and shows the various methods which he uses to bring sinners to
himself: - By dreams and visions, [Job
33:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#013.md); by secret inspirations, [Job
33:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#016.md); by afflictions, [Job
33:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#019.md); by messengers of
righteousness, [Job 33:23](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#023.md); and by the
great atonement, [Job 33:24](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#024.md). How and
from what God redeems men, and the blessings which he communicates, [Job
33:25-30](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#025.md). Job is exhorted to listen
attentively to Elihu's teaching, [Job
33:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#031.md).

[Job 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 33:3</span></span>

My words shall be of the uprightness - As God has given me his Spirit,
from that Spirit alone will I speak; therefore all my words shall be of
uprightness, knowledge, and truth.

Knowledge clearly - דעת ברור daath barur, pure science. I shall lay down
no false positions, and I shall have no false consequences.

[Job 33:4](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 33:4</span></span>

The Spirit of God hath made me - Another plain allusion to the account
of the creation of man, [Gen 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007.md), as
the words נשמת nishmath, the breath or breathing of God, and תחיני
techaiyeni, hath given me life, prove: "He breathed into his nostrils
the breath of lives, and he became a living soul."

[Job 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 33:6</span></span>

I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the
clay - Mr. Good, and before him none other that I have seen, has most
probably hit the true meaning: -

"Behold, I am thy fellow.

I too was formed by God out of the clay."

The word כפיך kephicha, which we translate according to thy wish, and
which, if Hebrew, would mean like to thy mouth; he considers as pure
Arabic, with a Hebrew postfix, (Arabic) kefoo, signifying fellow, equal,
like. Taken in this way, the passage is very plain, only לאל lael, by or
through God, must be added to the last clause of the verse instead of
the first, as Mr. Good has properly done.

[Job 33:7](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 33:7</span></span>

My terror shall not make thee afraid - This is an allusion to what Job
had said, [Job 9:34](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#034.md) : "Let him take
his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me." Being thy equal,
no fear can impose upon thee so far as to overawe thee; so that thou
shouldst not be able to conduct thy own defense. We are on equal terms;
now prepare to defend thyself.

[Job 33:8](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 33:8</span></span>

Surely thou hast spoken - What Elihu speaks here, and in the three
following verses, contains, in general, simple quotations from Job's own
words, or the obvious sense of them, as the reader may see by referring
to [Job 13:27](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#027) (note.md); [Job
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#016) (note.md), and [Job
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#004) (note.md), and also to the notes on
those passages.

[Job 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 33:11</span></span>

He putteth my feet in the stocks - See the note on [Job
13:27](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#027.md).

[Job 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 33:12</span></span>

In this thou art not just - Thou hast laid charges against God's
dealings, but thou hast not been able to justify those charges; and were
there nothing else against thee, these irreverent speeches are so many
proofs that thou art not clear in the sight of God.

[Job 33:13](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 33:13</span></span>

Why dost thou strive against him? - Is it not useless to contend with
God? Can he do any thing that is not right? As to his giving thee any
account of the reasons why he deals thus and thus with thee, or any one
else, thou needest not expect it; he is sovereign, and is not to be
called to the bar of his creatures. It is sufficient for thee to know
that "he is too wise to err, and too good to be unkind."

[Job 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 33:14</span></span>

For God speaketh once - Though he will not be summoned to the bar of his
creatures, nor condescend to detail the reasons of his conduct, which
they could not comprehend, yet he so acts, in the main, that the
operation of his hand and the designs of his counsel may sufficiently
appear, provided men had their eyes open upon his ways, and their hearts
open to receive his influence. Elihu, having made the general statement
that God would not come to the bar of his creatures to give account of
his conduct, shows the general means which he uses to bring men to an
acquaintance with themselves and with him: he states these in the six
following particulars, which may be collected from [Job
33:15-24](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#015.md).

[Job 33:15](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 33:15</span></span>

I. In a Dream

In a Dream - when deep sleep falleth upon men - Many, by such means,
have had the most salutary warnings; and to decry all such, because
there are many vain dreams, would be nearly as much wisdom as to deny
the Bible, because there are many foolish books, the authors of which
supposed they were under a Divine influence while composing them.

II\. In a Vision

In a Vision of the night - in slumberings upon the bed - Visions or
images presented in the imagination during slumber, when men are betwixt
sleeping and waking, or when, awake and in bed, they are wrapt up in
deep contemplation, the darkness of the night having shut out all
objects from their sight, so that the mind is not diverted by images of
earthly things impressed on the senses. Many warnings in this way have
come from God; and the impression they made, and the good effect they
produced, were the proofs of their Divine origin. To deny this would be
to call into doubt the testimony of the best, wisest, and holiest men in
all ages of the Church. Of one of these visions we have a remarkable
account in this book, [Job 4:12-21](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#012.md).
And this vision seems to have taken place in the night season, when
Eliphaz awoke from a deep sleep. There is this difference between the
accidents of the dream and the vision: the former takes place when deep
sleep falleth upon men; the latter, in the night, in or after
slumberings upon the bed.

[Job 33:16](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 33:16</span></span>

III\. By secret Inspirations

Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth, etc. - A dream or a vision
simply considered is likely to do no good; it is the opening of the
understanding, and the pouring in of the light, that make men wise to
salvation. Serious alarms, holy purposes, penitential pangs for past
sins, apprehension of death and judgment, discoveries of God's justice,
of Christ's love, of the world's vanity, of heaven's excellence, etc.,
etc., etc., are often used by the Divine Spirit to withdraw men from
their evil purpose, and to hide pride from man, [Job
33:17](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#017.md); and of all these openings of
the ear of the heart, and sealing instructions upon the conscience, we
have numerous examples in the history of the Church, in the experience
of good men, and even in the civil and providential history of all
nations.

[Job 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 33:18</span></span>

He keepeth back his soul from the pit - By the above means, how many
have been snatched from an untimely death! By taking the warning thus
given, some have been prevented from perishing by the pit - some sudden
accident; and others from the sword of the assassin or nocturnal
murderer. It would be easy to give examples, in all these kinds; but the
knowledge of the reader may save this trouble to the commentator.

[Job 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 33:19</span></span>

IV\. By Afflictions

He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, etc. - Afflictions are a
fourth means which God makes use of to awaken and convert sinners. In
the hand of God these were the cause of the salvation of David, as
himself testifies: Before I was afflicted, I went astray, [Psa
119:67](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#067.md), [Psa
119:71](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#071.md), [Psa
119:75](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#075.md).

The multitude of his bones - By such diseases, especially those of a
rheumatic kind, when to the patient's apprehension every bone is
diseased, broken, or out of joint.

Some render the passage, When the multitude of his bones is yet strong;
meaning those sudden afflictions which fall upon men when in a state of
great firmness and vigor. The original, ורוב עצמיו אתן verob atsamaiv
ethan, may be translated, And the strong multitude of his bones. Even
the strong multitude of his bones is chastened with pain upon his bed;
the place of rest and ease affording him no peace, quiet, or comfort.

The bones may be well termed multitudinous, as there are no less than 10
in the cranium, or skull; upper jaw, 13; lower jaw, 1; teeth, 32;
tongue, 1; vertebrae, or back-bone, 24; ribs, 24; sternum, or
breast-bone, 3; os innominatum, 1; scapula, or shoulder-blades, 2; arms,
6; hands, 54; thigh-bones, 2; knee-bones, 2; legs, 4; feet, 54: in all,
not less than 233 bones, without reckoning the ossa sethamoides;
because, though often numerous, they are found only in hard laborers, or
elderly persons.

[Job 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 33:20</span></span>

His life abhorreth bread - These expressions strongly and naturally
point out that general nausea, or loathing which sick persons feel in
almost every species of disorder.

[Job 33:21](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 33:21</span></span>

His flesh is consumed away - As in atrophy, marasmus, and consumptive
complaints in general.

[Job 33:22](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 33:22</span></span>

His soul draweth near unto the grave - נפש nephesh, soul, is here taken
for the immortal spirit, as it is distinguished from חיה chaiyah, the
animal life. The former draws near to the pit, שחת shachath, corruption;
perhaps he meant dissipation, considering it merely as the breath. The
latter draws near לממתים lamemithim, to the dead; i.e., to those who are
already buried. Mr. Good translates it the Destinies; and supposes the
same is meant among the Hebrews by the Memithim, as among the Greeks by
their Μοιραι; the Latins, by their Parcae; the Goths, by their Fatal
Sisters; the Scandinavians, by their goddess Hela; and the Arabians, by
Azrael, or the angel of death. I think, however, the signification given
above is more natural.

[Job 33:23](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 33:23</span></span>

V. The Messengers

If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, etc. - The Messengers
of righteousness; this is a Fifth method, אם יש עליו מלאך מליץ im yesh
alaiv malach melits, "If there be over him an interpreting or
mediatorial angel or messenger." One among a thousand, אחד מני אלף echad
minni aleph. "One from the Chief, Head, or Teacher."

To show unto man his uprightness - להגיד לאדם ישרו lehaggid leadam
yoshro, "to manifest or cause to be declared to man his righteousness:"
to show unto Adam - men in general, the descendants of the first man -
his purity and holiness; to convince him of sin, righteousness, and
judgment, that he may be prepared for the discovery of what is next to
be exhibited.

[Job 33:24](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 33:24</span></span>

Then he is gracious unto him - He exercises mercy towards fallen man,
and gives command for his respite and pardon. Deliver him from going
down to the pit - Let him who is thus instructed, penitent, and
afflicted, and comes to me, find a pardon; for: -

VI\. By an Atonement

I have found a ransom - כפר copher, an atonement. Pay a ransom for him,
פדעהו pedaehu, that he may not go down to the pit - to corruption or
destruction, for I have found out an atonement. It is this that gives
efficacy to all the preceding means; without which they would be
useless, and the salvation of man impossible. I must think that the
redemption of a lost world, by Jesus Christ, is not obscurely signified
in [Job 33:23](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#023.md), [Job
33:24](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#024.md). While the whole world lay in
the wicked one, and were all hastening to the bottomless pit, God so
loved the world that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever
believeth on him might not perish, but have everlasting life. Jesus
Christ, the great sacrifice, and head of the Church, commissions his
messengers - apostles and their successors - to show men the
righteousness of God, and his displeasure at sin, and at the same time
his infinite love, which commands them to proclaim deliverance to the
captives, and that they who believe on him shall not perish, shall not
go down to the pit of destruction, for he has found out an atonement;
and that whoever comes to him, through Christ, shall have everlasting
life, in virtue of that atonement or ransom price. Should it be objected
against my interpretation of אלף aleph, that it cannot be translated
chief or head, because it is without the vau shurek, אלוף alluph, which
gives it this signification; I would answer, that this form of the word
is not essential to the signification given above, as it occurs in
several places without the vau shurek, where it most certainly signifies
a chief, a leader, captain, etc., e.g., [Zac
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#007.md); [Jer
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#021.md), and [Gen
36:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#030.md); in the first of which we
translate it governor; in the second, captain; and in the third, duke.
And although we translate אלוף alluph an ox or beeve, (and it most
certainly has this meaning in several places), yet in this signification
it is written without the vau shurek in [Pro
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#004.md); [Psa
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#007.md); [Isa
30:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#024.md); and in [Deu
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#013.md); [Deu
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#004.md), [Deu
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#018.md), [Deu
28:51](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#051.md); which all show that this letter
is not absolutely necessary to the above signification.

[Job 33:25](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 33:25</span></span>

His flesh shall be fresher than a child's - He shall be born a new
creature.

He shall return to the days of his youth - He shall be born again, and
become a child of God, through faith in Christ Jesus.

[Job 33:26](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 33:26</span></span>

He shall pray unto God - Being now adopted into the heavenly family, and
become a new creature, he shall have the spirit of prayer, which is
indeed the very breath and language of the new or spiritual life.

He will be favorable unto him - He shall manifest his good will to him;
he shall live under the influences of Divine grace.

He shall see his face with joy - He shall know that God is reconciled to
him; and this shall fill him with joy, בתרועה bithruah, with exultation:
for, "being justified by faith, he has peace with God, through our Lord
Jesus Christ, by whom he has received the atonement; and Rejoices in the
hope of the glory of God."

He will render unto man his righteousness - So good and gracious is the
Lord, that by his grace he will enable this convert to live to his
glory, to bring forth all the fruits of the Spirit, and then reward him
for the work, as if it were done by his own might.

[Job 33:27](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">job 33:27</span></span>

He looketh upon men - אנשים anashim, wretched, fallen men. He shines
into them, to convince them of sin; and if any, under this convincing
light of God, say, I have sinned against heaven and before thee, and
perverted the right - abused the powers, faculties, mercies, and
advantages, which thou didst give me, by seeking rest and happiness in
the creature, and it profited me not - it was all vanity and vexation of
spirit; ולא שוה לי velo shavah li, "and it was not equal to me," did not
come up to my expectation, nor supply my wants: -

[Job 33:28](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">job 33:28</span></span>

He will deliver his soul - He will do that to every individual penitent
sinner which he has promised in his word to do for a lost world - he
will deliver his soul from going down to the pit of hell.

And his life shall see the light - He shall walk in the light, as Christ
is in the light; always enjoying a clear sense of his acceptance through
the blood of the Lamb. See another mode of paraphrasing these verses at
the end of the chapter.

[Job 33:29](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">job 33:29</span></span>

Lo, all these things worketh God - God frequently uses one, or another,
or all of these means, to bring men, גבר gaber, stout-hearted men, who
are far from righteousness, to holiness and heaven.

Oftentimes - פעמים שלש paamayim shalosh, "three times over;" or as פעמים
paamayim is by the points in the dual number, then it signifies twice
three times, that is, again and again; very frequently. Blessed be God!

[Job 33:30](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">job 33:30</span></span>

To bring back his soul from the pit - Nearly a repetition of the promise
in [Job 33:28](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#028.md).

To be enlightened with the light of the living - An echo of [Psa
56:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#013.md) : "Thou hast delivered my soul
from death, that I may walk before God in the light of the living;" and
probably quoted from it.

[Job 33:31](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">job 33:31</span></span>

Mark well, O Job - Pay the deepest attention to what I have said, and to
what I shall say.

[Job 33:32](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">job 33:32</span></span>

If thou hast any thing to say - If thou hast any objection to make
against what I have already stated, now answer, now speak freely; for it
is my desire that thou shouldst stand clear of all charges.

[Job 33:33](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">job 33:33</span></span>

If not - Then I will proceed: listen carefully, keep silence, and I will
teach thee what true wisdom is. Job was silent; none of his friends
chose to intermeddle farther; and in the next chapter Elihu addresses
both Job and them.

There are some various readings in the MSS. and versions on certain
words in the concluding verses of this chapter, which it will be
necessary to mention, as they, if adopted, will lead to a somewhat
different paraphrase to that given, especially of [Job
33:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#026.md).

[Job 33:26](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#026.md) For צדקתו tsidkatho, His
righteousness, one MS. and the Chaldee have כצדקתו ketsidkatho,
According to his righteousness.

[Job 33:28](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#028.md) For נפשו naphsho, His soul,
which is the keri reading, and that which our translation has followed,
נפשי My soul is the reading of many MSS., early editions, the
Complutensian, Antwerp, and London Polyglots, the Jerusalem Targum, the
Chaldee, the Vulgate, and Coverdale.

For חיתו chaiyatho, His life, many MSS., early editions, the
Complutensian, Antwerp, and London Polyglots, the Jerusalem Targum,
Chaldee, Vulgate, and Coverdale, read חיתי chaiyathi, My life. Both of
these are properly the kethib or textual readings in the best editions,
but are directed by the Masora to be changed for the keri readings, or
those inserted in the margin.

For באור תראה baor tireh, Shall See the light, six of Kennicott's and De
Rossi's MSS. have תהיה tihyeh, and twenty-one have כאור caor, thus כאור
תהיה caor tihiyeh, Shall Be As the light. The whole verse, by these
various readings, will stand thus: - "He will deliver My soul from going
into the pit, and My life Shall Be As the light." But if, with the
Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic, we read פדה padah, in the imperative
mood, then the verse will read thus: - "Deliver Thou My Soul from going
down to the pit, and My life Shall Be As the light."

On the [Job 33:26](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#026.md), [Job
33:27](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#027.md), [Job
33:28](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#028.md), and [Job
33:29](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#029.md) verses, the following paraphrase
has been recommended.

[Job 33:26](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#026.md) He (Jesus Christ, the head
and ransom price) shall pray unto God, (shall make intercession for the
transgressors, for he is the Mediator between God and man). And he (God
the Father) will be favorable, (ירצהו yirtsehu, will manifest his good
will towards him). And he shall see his face (פניו panaiv, his faces,
God the Father, Son, and Spirit) with joy, (בתרועה bithruah, with
exultation or triumph), for he will render unto man his righteousness,
(ושב לאנוש צדקתי yasheb leenosh tsidkatho, "He will restore to wretched
man his righteousness;" i.e., he will create the soul anew, and restore
to the fallen spirit that righteousness and true holiness which it has
lost, and bring it again to its original state of perfection, through
the grand atonement mentioned [Job
33:24](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#024).md).

But when is it that wretched miserable man shall be brought to this
state of salvation? This is answered in

[Job 33:27](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#027.md) When God, looking upon men,
seeth any of them saying, I have sinned and perverted that which is
right, and it hath profited me nothing - has afforded nothing equal to
my wishes, and the tribulation which I sustained in seeking happiness in
forbidden things. Redeem my soul from going down to destruction, and my
life shall see the light, or shall be as the light. This is the prayer
of the penitent, which God has promised to hear.

This is one of the best, the deepest, the most spiritual, and most
important chapters which the reader has yet met with in the Book of Job.
It is every way important, and full of useful information. It is a grand
exhibition of the Way of salvation as revealed to patriarchs and
prophets.
