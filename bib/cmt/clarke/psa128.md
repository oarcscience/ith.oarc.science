### [Psalms Chapter 128](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 128:0</span></span>

The blessedness of the man that fears the Lord, [Psa
128:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#001). He is blessed in his labor,
[Psa 128:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#002); in his wife and children,
[Psa 128:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#003), [Psa
128:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#004); in the ordinances of God, [Psa
128:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#005); and in a long life and numerous
posterity, [Psa 128:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#006).

This Psalm has no title, either in the Hebrew or any of the Versions;
though the Syriac supposes it to have been spoken of Zerubbabel, prince
of Judah, who was earnestly engaged in building the temple of the Lord.
It seems to be a continuation of the preceding Psalm, or rather the
second part of it. The man who is stated to have a numerous offspring,
in the preceding Psalm, is here represented as sitting at table with his
large family. A person in the mean while coming in, sees his happy
state, speaks of his comforts, and predicts to him and his all possible
future good. And why? Because the man and his family "fear God, and walk
in his ways."

[Psalms 128:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 128:2</span></span>

Those shalt eat the labor of thine hands - Thou shalt not be exempted
from labor. Thou shalt work: But God will bless and prosper that work,
and thou and thy family shall eat of it. Ye shall all live on the
produce of your own labor, and the hand of violence shall not be
permitted to deprive you of it. Thus,

Happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee - Thou shalt have
prosperity.

[Psalms 128:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 128:3</span></span>

Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine - Thy children, in every corner and
apartment of thy house, shall be the evidences of the fruitfulness of
thy wife, as bunches of grapes on every bough of the vine are the proofs
of its being in a healthy thriving state. Being about the house sides,
or apartments, is spoken of the wife, not the vine; being around the
table is spoken of the children, not of the olive-plants. It does not
appear that there were any vines planted against the walls of the houses
in Jerusalem, nor any olive-trees in pots or tubs in the inside of their
houses; as may be found in different parts of Europe.

[Psalms 128:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 128:4</span></span>

Thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord - A great price for
a small consideration. Fear God, and thou shalt have as much domestic
good as may be useful to thee.

[Psalms 128:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 128:5</span></span>

The Lord shall bless thee out of Zion - In all thy approaches to him in
his house by prayer, by sacrifice, and by offering, thou shalt have his
especial blessing. Thou shalt thrive every where, and in all things.

And thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem - Thou shalt see the cause of
God flourish in thy lifetime, and his Church in great prosperity.

[Psalms 128:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 128:6</span></span>

Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children - Thou shall not die till
thou have seen thy family all settled in the world, and those of them
who may be married blessed with children.

And peace upon Israel - This is the same conclusion as in [Psa
125:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#001); and should be translated,
Peace be upon Israel! May God favor his own cause, and bless all his
people!
