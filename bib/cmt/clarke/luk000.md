Preface to the Gospel According to St. LukeWith a Short Account of His
Life

There is little certain known of this evangelist: from what is spoken in
the Scriptures, and by the best informed of the primitive fathers, the
following probable account is collected: -

Luke was, according to Dr. Lardner, a Jew by birth, and an early convert
to Christianity; but Michaelis thinks he was a Gentile, and brings [Col
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010), [Col
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#011), [Col
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#014), in proof, where St. Paul
distinguished Aristarchus, Marcus, and Jesus, who was called Justus,
from Epaphras, Lucas, and Demas, who were of the circumcision, i.e.
Jews. Some think he was one of our Lord's seventy disciples. It is
worthy of remark that he is the only evangelist who mentions the
commission given by Christ to the seventy, Luke 10:1-20. It is likely he
is the Lucius mentioned [Rom 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#021),
and if so he was related to the Apostle Paul, and that it is the same
Lucius of Cyrene who is mentioned [Act
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#001), and in general with others, [Act
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#020). Some of the ancients, and some
of the most learned and judicious among the moderns, think he was one of
the two whom our Lord met on the way to Emmaus on the day of his
resurrection, as related Luke 24:13-35; one of these was called Cleopas,
[Luk 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#018), the other is not
mentioned, the evangelist, himself, being the person and the relator.

St. Paul styles him his fellow-laborer, [Plm
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#024). It is barely probable that he is
the person mentioned, [Col 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#014), Luke,
the beloved physician. All the ancients of repute, such as Eusebius,
Gregory Nyssen, Jerome, Paulinus, Euthalius, Euthymius, and others,
agree that he was a physician, but where he was born, and where he
exercised the duties of his profession, are not known. Many moderns have
attributed to him the most profound skill in the science of painting,
and that he made some pictures of the Virgin Mary. This is justly
esteemed fabulous; nor is this science attributed to him by any writer
previously to Nicephorus Callisti, in the fourteenth century, an author
who scarcely deserves any credit, especially in relations not confirmed
by others.

He accompanied St. Paul when he first went into Macedonia, Acts 16:8-40;
[Act 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001); [Act
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#001); [Act
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#001). Whether he went with him
constantly afterwards is not certain; but it is evident he accompanied
him from Greece through Macedonia and Asia to Jerusalem, where he is
supposed to have collected many particulars of the evangelic history:
from Jerusalem he went with Paul to Rome, where he stayed with him the
two years of his imprisonment in that city. This alone makes out the
space of five years, and upwards. It is probable that he left St. Paul
when he was set at liberty, and that he then went into Greece, where he
finished and published this Gospel, and the book of the Acts, which he
dedicated to Theophilus, an honorable Christian friend of his in that
country. It is supposed that he died in peace about the eightieth or
eighty-fourth year of his age. Some suppose he published this Gospel
fifteen, others twenty-two years after the ascension of Christ.

See much on this subject in Lardner, Works, vol. vi. p. 104, etc., and
in Michaelis's Introduction to the New Testament.

Some learned men think that Luke has borrowed considerably from St.
Matthew: collate [Luk 3:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#007), [Luk
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#016), [Luk
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#017), with [Mat
3:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#007); also Luke 5:20-38, with
Matthew 9:2-17; also [Luk 6:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#001), with
[Mat 12:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001); [Luk
7:22-28](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#022), with [Mat
11:4-11](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#004); also [Luk
12:22-31](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#022), with [Mat
6:25-33](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025). It is allowed that there is
considerable diversity in the order of time between St Matthew and St.
Luke, which is accounted for thus: Matthew deduces the facts related in
his history in chronological order. Luke, on the contrary, appears to
have paid little attention to this order, because he proposed to make a
classification of events, referring each to its proper class, without
paying any attention to chronological arrangement. Some critics divide
this history into five distinct classes or sections, in the following
manner: -

CLASS I. Comprehends all the details relative to the birth of Christ;
with the preceding, concomitant, and immediately succeeding
circumstances. [Luk 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001), and 2:1-40.

CLASS II. Contains a description of our Lord's infancy and bringing up;
his visit to the temple when twelve years of age; and his going down to
Nazareth and continuing under the government of his parents; [Luk
2:41-52](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#041).

CLASS III. Contains the account of the preaching of John Baptist, and
his success; the baptism of Christ, and his genealogy. [Luk
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#001).

CLASS IV. Comprehends the account of all our Lord's transactions in
Galilee, for the whole three years of his ministry, from [Luk
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#001) to Luke 9:1-50. This seems
evident: for as soon as Luke had given the account of our Lord's
temptation in the deserts [Luk 4:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#001),
he represents him as immediately returning in the power of the Spirit
into Galilee, [Luk 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#014); mentions
Nazareth, [Luk 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#016); Capernaum, [Luk
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#031); and the lake of Galilee, [Luk
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#001); and thus, to [Luk
9:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#050), goes on to describe the
preaching, miracles, etc.; of our Lord in Galilee.

CLASS V. and last, commences at [Luk
9:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#051), where the evangelist gives an
account of our Lord's last journey to Jerusalem: therefore this class
contains, not only all the transactions of our Lord from that time to
his crucifixion, but also, the account of his resurrection, his
commission to his apostles, and his ascension to heaven. [Luk
9:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#051), to [Luk
24:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#053), inclusive.

A plan similar to this has been followed by Suetonius, in his life of
Augustus: he does not produce his facts in chronological order, but
classifies them, as he himself professes, cap. 12, giving an account of
all his wars, honors, legislative acts, discipline, domestic life, etc.,
etc. Matthew therefore, is to be consulted for the correct arrangement
of facts in chronological order: Luke, for a classification of facts and
events, without any attention to the order of time in which they
occurred. Many eminent historians have conducted their narratives in the
same way. See Rosenmuller. It must not, however, be forgotten, that this
evangelist gives us some very valuable chronological data in several
parts of the three first chapters. These shall be noticed in their
proper places.
