### [Isaiah Chapter 58](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 58:0</span></span>

This elegant chapter contains a severe reproof of the Jews on account of
their vices, particularly their hypocrisy in practising and relying on
outward ceremonies, such as fasting and bodily humiliation, without true
repentance, [Isa 58:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#001.md). It then lays
down a clear and comprehensive summary of the duties they owed to their
fellow creatures, [Isa 58:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#006.md), [Isa
58:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#007.md). Large promises of happiness and
prosperity are likewise annexed to the performance of these duties in a
variety of the most beautiful and striking images, [Isa
58:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#008.md). Great temporal and spiritual
blessedness of those who keep holy the Sabbath day, [Isa
58:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#013.md), [Isa
58:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#014.md).

[Isaiah 58:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 58:1</span></span>

Cry aloud, spare not - Never was a louder cry against the hypocrisy, nor
a more cutting reproof of the wickedness, of a people professing a
national established religion, having all the forms of godliness without
a particle of its power. This chapter has been often appointed to be
read on political fast days for the success of wars carried on for - God
knows what purposes, and originating in - God knows what motives.
Politically speaking, was ever any thing more injudicious?

[Isaiah 58:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 58:3</span></span>

Have we adopted our soul "Have we afflicted our souls" - Twenty-seven
MSS. (six ancient) of Dr. Kennicott's, thirty-six of De Rossi's, and two
of my own, and the old edition of 1488 have the noun in the plural
number, נפשינו naphsheynu, our souls; and so the Septuagint, Chaldee,
and Vulgate. This reading is undoubtedly genuine.

In the day of your fast ye find pleasure - Fast days are generally
called holidays, and holidays are days of idleness and pleasure. In
numberless cases the fast is turned into a feast.

And exact all your labors - Some disregard the most sacred fast, and
will oblige their servant to work all day long; others use fast days for
the purpose of settling their accounts, posting up their books, and
drawing out their bills to be ready to collect their debts. These are
sneaking hypocrites; the others are daringly irreligious.

[Isaiah 58:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 58:4</span></span>

Ye fast for strife and debate - How often is this the case! A whole
nation are called to fast to implore God's blessing on wars carried on
for the purposes of wrath and ambition.

To smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as ye do this
day "To smite with the fist the poor. Wherefore fast ye unto me in this
manner" - I follow the version of the Septuagint, which gives a much
better sense than the present reading of the Hebrew. Instead of רשע לא
resha lo, they seem to have read in their copy רש על מה לי rash al mah
lli. The four first letters are the same, but otherwise divided in
regard to the words; the four last are lost, and א aleph added in their
place, in order to make some sort of sense with רשע ל. The version of
the Septuagint is, και τυπτετε τυγμαις ταπεινον· ἱνα τι μοι νηστευετε -
as above.

[Isaiah 58:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 58:6</span></span>

Let the oppressed go free - How can any nation pretend to fast or
worship God at all, or dare to profess that they believe in the
existence of such a Being, while they carry on the slave trade, and
traffic in the souls, blood, and bodies, of men! O ye most flagitious of
knaves, and worst of hypocrites, cast off at once the mask of religion;
and deepen not your endless perdition by professing the faith of our
Lord Jesus Christ, while ye continue in this traffic!

[Isaiah 58:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 58:7</span></span>

Deal thy bread to the hungry - But this thou canst not do, if thou eat
it thyself. When a man fasts, suppose he do it through a religious
motive, he should give the food of that day, from which he abstains, to
the poor and hungry, who, in the course of providence, are called to
sustain many involuntary fasts, besides suffering general privations. Wo
to him who saves a day's victuals by his religious fast! He should
either give them or their value in money to the poor. See [Isa
58:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#006.md).

That thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house "To bring the
wandering poor into thy house" - πτωχους αστεγους, Septuagint; egenos
vagosque, Vulgate; and מטלטלין metaltelin, Chaldee. They read, instead
of מרודים merudim, הנודים hanudim. מר mer is upon a rasure in the
Bodleian MS. The same MS. reads ביתה bayethah, in domum, "into the
house." - L.

[Isaiah 58:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 58:8</span></span>

And thine health shall spring forth speedily "And thy wounds shall
speedily be healed over" - Et cicatrix vulneris tui cito obducetur "And
the scar of thy wounds shall be speedily removed." Aquila's Version, as
reported by Jerome, with which agrees that of the Chaldee.

The glory "And the glory" - Sixteen MSS. (five ancient) of Dr.
Kennicott's, and the Septuagint, Syriac, and Vulgate add the conjunction
ו vau, וכבוד vechabod.

[Isaiah 58:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 58:10</span></span>

And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry "If thou bring forth thy
bread to the hungry" - "To draw out thy soul to the hungry," as our
translators rightly enough express the present Hebrew text, is an
obscure phrase, and without example in any other place. But instead of
נפשך naphshecha, thy soul, eight MSS. (three ancient) of Kennicott's and
three of De Rossi's read לחמך lachmecha, thy bread; and so the Syriac
renders it. The Septuagint express both words, τον αρτον εκ της ψυχης
σου, "thy bread from thy soul." I cannot help thinking, however, that
this reading is a gloss, and should not be adopted. To draw out the soul
in relieving the poor, is to do it, not of constraint or necessity, but
cheerfully, and is both nervous and elegant. His soul pities and his
hand gives.

[Isaiah 58:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 58:11</span></span>

And make fat thy bones "And he shall renew thy strength" - Chaldaeus
forte legit יחכיף עצמתך yachaliph otsmathecha; confer cap. [Isa
40:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#029.md), [Isa
40:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#031.md), et [Isa
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#001.md). - Secker. "The Chaldee perhaps
read יחליף עצמתך yachaliph otsmathecha. "The Chaldee has וגופך יחיי בחיי
עלמא veguphach vechaiyey bechaiyey alma, "and he will vivify thy body in
life eternal." The rest of the ancients seem not to know what to make of
יחליץ yachalits; and the rendering of the Vulgate, which seems to be the
only proper one, ossa tua liberabit, "he will deliver thy bones," makes
no sense. I follow this excellent emendation; to favor which it is still
farther to be observed that three MSS., instead of עצמתיך atsmotheycha,
have עצמתך otsmathecha, singular. - L.

[Isaiah 58:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 58:12</span></span>

The restorer of paths to dwell in "The restorer of paths to be
frequented by inhabitants" - To this purpose it is rendered by the
Syriac, Symmachus, and Theodotion.

[Isaiah 58:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 58:13</span></span>

If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath - The meaning of this seems
to be, that they should be careful not to take their pleasure on the
Sabbath day, by paying visits, and taking country jaunts; not going, as
Kimchi interprets it, more than a Sabbath day's journey, which was only
two thousand cubits beyond the city's suburbs. How vilely is this rule
transgressed by the inhabitants of this land! They seem to think that
the Sabbath was made only for their recreation!

From doing thy pleasure - The Septuagint, Syriac, and Chaldee, for עשות
asoth, manifestly express מעשות measoth. So likewise a MS. has it, but
with the omission of the words שבת רגלך shabbath raglecha. - L.

The holy of the Lord "And the holy feast of Jehovah" - Twenty-eight MSS.
(seven ancient) add the conjunction ו vau, ולקדוש velikedosh; and so the
Syriac, Chaldee, and Vulgate. One of my own has the same reading.

Nor speaking thine own words "From speaking vain words" - It is
necessary to add some epithet to make out the sense; the Septuagint say,
angry words; the Chaldee, words of violence. If any such epithet is lost
here, the safest way is to supply it by the prophet's own expression,
[Isa 58:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#009.md), ודבר און vedabar aven, vain
words; that is, profane, impious, injurious, etc.

"The additional epithet seems unnecessary; the Vulgate and Syriac have
it not; and the sense is good without it; two ways, first by taking ודבר
vedabar for a noun, and דבר dabur for the participle pahul, and
rendering, -

'From pursuing thy pleasure, and the thing resolved on.'

Or, secondly, by supposing the force of the preposition מ mem to have
been continued from the verb ממצוא mimmetso to the verb ודבר vedabber
immediately following; and rendering, -

'From executing thy pleasure, and from speaking words concerning it.'

But the first seems the easier rendering."

Dr. Jubb.

[Isaiah 58:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 58:14</span></span>

Then shalt thou delight thyself - If all fasts and religious observances
be carried on in the spirit and manner recommended above, God's blessing
will attend every ordinance. But in public fasts, prescribed not in the
Book of God, but by the rulers of nations in general (very unfit
persons) care should be taken that the cause is good, and that God's
blessing may be safely implored in it.

France has lately fasted and prayed that they might be able to subjugate
Spain, restore and establish the horrible inquisition, and utterly
destroy all the liberties of the people! Is this such a fast as God hath
chosen? - a.d. 1823.
