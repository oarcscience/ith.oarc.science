### [Lamentations Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#001.md)

[Lamentations](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lam 5:0</span></span>

This chapter is, as it were, an epiphonema, or conclusion to the four
preceding, representing the nation as groaning under their calamities,
and humbly supplicating the Divine favor, vv. 1-22.

[Lamentations 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lam 5:1</span></span>

Remember, O Lord - In the Vulgate, Syriac, and Arabic, this is headed,
"The prayer of Jeremiah." In my old MS. Bible: Here bigynneth the orison
of Jeremye the prophete.

Though this chapter consists of exactly twenty-two verses, the number of
letters in the Hebrew alphabet, yet the acrostic form is no longer
observed. Perhaps any thing so technical was not thought proper when in
agony and distress (under a sense of God's displeasure on account of
sin) they prostrated themselves before him to ask for mercy. Be this as
it may, no attempt appears to have been made to throw these verses into
the form of the preceding chapters. It is properly a solemn prayer of
all the people, stating their past and present sufferings, and praying
for God's mercy.

Behold our reproach - הביט hebita. But many MSS. of Kennicott's, and the
oldest of my own, add the ה he paragogic, הביטה hebitah, "Look down
earnestly with commiseration;" for paragogic letters always increase the
sense.

[Lamentations 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lam 5:2</span></span>

Our inheritance is turned to strangers - The greater part of the Jews
were either slain or carried away captive; and even those who were left
under Gedaliah were not free, for they were vassals to the Chaldeans.

[Lamentations 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lam 5:4</span></span>

We have drunken our water for money - I suppose the meaning of this is,
that every thing was taxed by the Chaldeans, and that they kept the
management in their own hands, so that wood and water were both sold,
the people not being permitted to help themselves. They were now so
lowly reduced by servitude, that they were obliged to pay dearly for
those things which formerly were common and of no price. A poor Hindoo
in the country never buys fire-wood, but when he comes to the city he is
obliged to purchase his fuel, and considers it as a matter of great
hardship.

[Lamentations 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lam 5:5</span></span>

Our necks are under persecution - We feel the yoke of our bondage; we
are driven to our work like the bullock, which has a yoke upon his neck.

[Lamentations 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lam 5:6</span></span>

We have given the hand to the Egyptians - We have sought alliances both
with the Egyptians and Assyrians, and made covenants with them in order
to get the necessaries of life. Or, wherever we are now driven, we are
obliged to submit to the people of the countries in order to the
preservation of our lives.

[Lamentations 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lam 5:7</span></span>

Our fathers have sinned, and are not - Nations, as such, cannot be
punished in the other world; therefore national judgments are to be
looked for only in this life. The punishment which the Jewish nation had
been meriting for a series of years came now upon them, because they
copied and increased the sins of their fathers, and the cup of their
iniquity was full. Thus the children might be said to bear the sins of
the fathers, that is, in temporal punishment, for in no other way does
God visit these upon the children. See [Eze
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#001.md), etc.

[Lamentations 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lam 5:8</span></span>

Servants have ruled over us - To be subject to such is the most painful
and dishonorable bondage: -

Quio domini faciant,

audent cum talia fures?

Virg. Ecl. 3:16.

"Since slaves so insolent are grown,

What may not masters do?"

Perhaps he here alludes to the Chaldean soldiers, whose will the
wretched Jews were obliged to obey.

[Lamentations 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lam 5:9</span></span>

We gat our bread with the peril of our lives - They could not go into
the wilderness to feed their cattle, or to get the necessaries of life,
without being harassed and plundered by marauding parties, and by these
were often exposed to the peril of their lives. This was predicted by
Moses, [Deu 28:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#031.md).

[Lamentations 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lam 5:10</span></span>

Our skin was black - because of the terrible famine - Because of the
searching winds that burnt up every green thing, destroying vegetation,
and in consequence producing a famine.

[Lamentations 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lam 5:11</span></span>

They ravished the women in Zion, and the maids in the cities of Judah -
The evil mentioned here was predicted by Moses, [Deu
28:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#030.md), [Deu
28:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#032.md), and by Jeremiah, [Jer
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#012.md).

[Lamentations 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lam 5:12</span></span>

Princes are hanged up by their hand - It is very probable that this was
a species of punishment. They were suspended from hooks in the wall by
their hands till they died through torture and exhaustion. The body of
Saul was fastened to the wall of Bethshan, probably in the same way; but
his head had already been taken off. They were hung in this way that
they might be devoured by the fowls of the air. It was a custom with the
Persians after they had slain, strangled, or beheaded their enemies, to
hang their bodies upon poles, or empale them. In this way they treated
Histiaeus of Miletum, and Leonidas of Lacedaemon. See Herodot. lib. 6 c.
30, lib. 7 c. 238.

[Lamentations 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lam 5:13</span></span>

They took the young men to grind - This was the work of female slaves.
See the note on [Isa 47:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#002.md).

[Lamentations 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lam 5:14</span></span>

The elders have ceased from the gate - There is now no more justice
administered to the people; they are under military law, or disposed of
in every sense according to the caprice of their masters.

[Lamentations 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lam 5:16</span></span>

The crown is fallen from our head - At feasts, marriages, etc., they
used to crown themselves with garlands of flowers; all festivity of this
kind was now at an end. Or it may refer to their having lost all
sovereignty, being made slaves.

[Lamentations 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lam 5:18</span></span>

The foxes walk upon it - Foxes are very numerous in Palestine, see on
[Jdg 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#004) (note.md). It was usual among
the Hebrews to consider all desolated land to be the resort of wild
beasts; which is, in fact, the case every where when the inhabitants are
removed from a country.

[Lamentations 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lam 5:19</span></span>

Thou, O Lord, remainest for ever - Thou sufferest no change. Thou didst
once love us, O let that love be renewed towards us!

[Lamentations 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lam 5:21</span></span>

Renew our days as of old - Restore us to our former state. Let us regain
our country, our temple, and all the Divine offices of our religion;
but, more especially, thy favor.

[Lamentations 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lam 5:22</span></span>

But thou hast utterly rejected us - It appears as if thou hadst sealed
our final reprobation, because thou showest against us exceeding great
wrath. But convert us, O Lord, onto thee, and we shall be converted. We
are now greatly humbled, feel our sin, and see our folly: once more
restore us, and we shall never again forsake thee! He heard the prayer;
and at the end of seventy years they were restored to their own land.

This last verse is well rendered in the first printed edition of our
Bible, 1535: - Renue our daies as in olde tyme, for thou hast now
banished us longe ynough, and bene sore displeased at us.

My old MS. Bible is not less nervous: Newe thou our dais as fro the
begynnyng: bot castand aweie thou put us out: thou wrathedist ugein us
hugely.

Dr. Blayney translates, "For surely thou hast cast us off altogether:"
and adds, "כי ki ought certainly to be rendered as causal; God's having
rejected his people, and expressed great indignation against them, being
the cause and ground of the preceding application, in which they pray to
be restored to his favor, and the enjoyment of their ancient
privileges."

Pareau thinks no good sense can be made of this place unless we
translate interrogatively, as in [Jer
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#019.md) : -

"Hast thou utterly rejected Judah?

Hath thy soul loathed Sion?"

On this ground he translates here,

An enim prorsus nos rejecisses?

Nobis iratus esses usque adeo?

"Hast thou indeed utterly cast us off?

Wilt thou be angry with us for ever?"

Wilt thou extend thy wrath against us so as to show us no more mercy?
This agrees well with the state and feelings of the complainants.

Masoretic Notes

Number of verses in this Book, 154.

Middle verse, [Lam 3:34](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#034.md).

In one of my oldest MSS., the twenty-first verse is repeated at the
conclusion of the twenty-second verse. In another, yet older, there is
only the first word of it, השיבנו hashibenu, Convert us!

Having given in the preceding preface and notes what I judge necessary
to explain the principal difficulties in this very fine and affecting
poem, very fitly termed The Lamentations, as it justly stands at the
head of every composition of the kind, I shall add but a few words, and
these shall be by way of recapitulation chiefly.

The Hebrews were accustomed to make lamentations or mourning songs upon
the death of great men, princes, and heroes, who had distinguished
themselves in arms; and upon any occasion or public miseries and
calamities. Calmet thinks they had collections of these sorts of
Lamentations: and refers in proof to [Ch2
35:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#025.md) : "And Jeremiah lamented for
Josiah; and all the singing men and the singing women spake of Josiah in
their lamentations, to this day; and made them an ordinance in Israel:
and, behold, they are written in the Lamentations."

From this verse it is evident, that Jeremiah had composed a funeral
elegy on Josiah: but, from the complexion of this Book, it is most
evident that it was not composed on the death of Josiah, but upon the
desolations of Jerusalem, etc., as has already been noted. His
lamentation for Josiah is therefore lost. It appears also, that on
particular occasions, perhaps anniversaries, these lamentations were
sung by men and women singers, who performed their several parts; for
these were all alternate or responsive songs. And it is very likely,
that this book was sung in the same way; the men commencing with א
aleph, the women responding with ב beth and so on. Several of this sort
of songs are still extant. We have those which David composed on the
death of his son Absalom, and on the death of his friend Jonathan. And
we have those made by Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, on the desolation
of Egypt, Tyre, Sidon, and Babylon. See [Isa
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#004.md), [Isa
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#005.md); [Isa
15:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001.md); [Isa
16:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#001.md); [Jer
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#029.md); [Jer
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#010.md); [Jer
48:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#032.md); [Eze
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#001.md); [Eze
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#011.md); [Eze
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#002.md); [Jer
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#017.md). Besides these, we have fragments
of others in different places; and references to some, which are now
finally lost.

In the two first chapters of this book, the prophet describes,
principally, the calamities of the siege of Jerusalem.

In the third, he deplores the persecutions which he himself had
suffered; though he may in this be personifying the city and state; many
of his own sufferings being illustrative of the calamities that fell
generally upon the city and people at large.

The fourth chapter is employed chiefly on the ruin and desolation of the
city and temple; and upon the misfortunes of Zedekiah, of whom he speaks
in a most respectful, tender, and affecting manner: -

"The anointed of Jehovah,

the breadth of our nostrils,

was taken in their toils,

Under whose shadow we said,

We shall live among the nations."

At the end he speaks of the cruelty of the Edomites, who had insulted
Jerusalem in her miseries, and contributed to its demolition. These he
threatens with the wrath of God.

The fifth chapter is a kind of form of prayer for the Jews, in their
dispersions and captivity. In the conclusion of it, he speaks of their
fallen royalty; attributes all their calamities to their rebellion and
wickedness; and acknowledges that there can be no end to their misery,
but in their restoration to the Divine favor.

This last chapter was probably written some considerable time after the
rest: for it supposes the temple to be so deserted, that the foxes
walked undisturbed among its ruins, and that the people were already in
captivity.

The poem is a monument of the people's iniquity and rebellion; of the
displeasure and judgment of God against them; and of the piety,
eloquence, and incomparable ability of the poet.
