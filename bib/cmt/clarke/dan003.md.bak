### [Daniel Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#001.md)

[Daniel](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">dan 3:0</span></span>

Nebuchadnezzar, having erected an image, whose height (including
probably a very high pedestal) was sixty cubits, and the breadth six,
ordered a numerous assembly, which he had convened, to fall down and
worship it; threatening, at the same time, that whosoever refused should
be cast into a fiery furnace, [Dan
3:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#001.md); a punishment not uncommon in
that country, (see [Jer 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#022)..md)
Daniel's three companions, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who were
present, being observed to refrain from this idolatrous worship, were
accused before the king; who, in great wrath, commanded them to comply
with his orders on pain of death, [Dan
3:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#008.md). But these holy men, with the
greatest composure and serenity, expressed their firm resolution not to
worship his gods or his images, whatever might be the consequence, [Dan
3:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#016.md). Upon which the king,
unaccustomed to have his will opposed, in the height of his wrath,
ordered the furnace to be made seven times hotter than usual, and these
men to be cast into it, bound by the most mighty of his army, who were
killed by the flame in the execution of this service, [Dan
3:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#019.md). On this occasion God
literally performed his promise by Isaiah, ([Isa
43:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#002) .md): "When thou walkest through the
fire, thou shalt not be burnt; neither shall the flame kindle upon
thee;" for an angel of God, appearing in the furnace, protected these
young men, and counteracted the natural violence of the fire; which,
only consuming the cords with which they were bound, left them to walk
at liberty, and in perfect safety, in the midst of the furnace. The
king, astonished at this prodigy, called to them to come out of the
furnace, and blessed God for sending an angel to deliver his servants;
and commanded all his subjects, upon pain of death, not to speak
irreverently of the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who were
promoted to great power and honor, [Dan
3:24-30](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#024.md). A striking example of the
interposition of Providence in favor of true and inflexible piety.

[Daniel 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">dan 3:1</span></span>

Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold - It is supposed that the
history given here did not occur till the close, or near the end, of
Nebuchadnezzar's reign. For it was after his insanity, as we see [Dan
4:33-36](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#033.md), and this happened near the
close of his reign. The authorized version, which is followed in the
margin, fixes the date of this event seventeen years earlier, and ten
years before the king's insanity. A few observations on this image may
be necessary: -

1\. It is not likely that this image was in human form - the dimensions
show the improbability of this; for what proportion is there between
sixty cubits (ninety feet) in length, and six cubits (nine feet) in
breadth?

2\. It is not likely that this image was all of gold; for this would
have required more of this precious metal than the whole province of
Babylon could produce; for as I suppose the sixty cubits apply to the
perpendicular altitude, so I take it for granted that the six cubits
intend the diameter. Now a column of gold of this height in diameter,
upon the supposition that the pillar was circular, contains five
thousand seven hundred and twenty-five and a half cubic feet; and as
there are nineteen thousand avoirdupois ounces in a cubic foot, the
weight of the whole pillar would be eight million two hundred and
sixty-two thousand eight hundred and six pounds, ten ounces of gold.

3\. It might have been a pillar on which an image of the god Bel was
erected. The image itself might be of gold, or more probably gilt, that
is, covered with thin plates of gold, and on this account it might be
called the golden image; and most probably the height of the image may
be confounded with the height of the pillar. Or perhaps it was no more
than a pillar, on the sides of which their gods and sacred emblems were
engraven, surmounted with Bel on the top.

The plain of Dura - The situation of this place is not exactly known;
there was a town or city called Dura, or Doura, in Mesopotamia, near the
Tigris.

[Daniel 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">dan 3:2</span></span>

Sent to gather together the princes - It is not easy to show what these
different offices were, as it is difficult to ascertain the meaning of
the Chaldee words. Parkhurst analyzes them thus: -

The Princes - אחשדרפניא achashdarpenaiya, from אחש Achash, great or
eminent, and דר dar, "to go about freely," and פנים panim, "the
presence." Satraps or privy counsellors who had free access to the
presence of the king.

The Governors - סגניא signaiya, lieutenants or viceroys, for סגן sagan,
among the Hebrews, was the name of the high priest's deputy.

The Captains - פחותא pachavatha, from פח pach, to extend, because set
over those provinces that had been annexed to the kingdom by conquest.
Pashas - This word and office are still in use in Asiatic countries. By
corruption we pronounce bashaw.

The Judges - אדרגזריא adargazeraiya, from אדר adar, noble or
magnificent, and גזר gazar, to decree. The nobles, the assistants to the
king in making laws, statutes, etc. The same probably in Babylon, as the
House of Lords in England.

The Treasurers - גדבריא gedaberaiya, from גנז ganaz, (the ז zain being
changed into ד daleth, according to the custom of the Chaldee), to
treasure up, and בר bar, pure. Those who kept the current coin, or were
over the mint; the treasurers of the exchequer in Babylon.

The Counsellors - דתבריא dethaberaiya, from דת dath, a statute, and בר
bar, "to declare the meaning of the law;" for in all ages and countries
there has been what is termed the glorious uncertainty of the law; and
therefore there must be a class of men whose business it is to explain
it. What a pity that law cannot be tendered to the people as other
sciences are, in plain, unsophisticated, and intelligible terms, and by
persons whose business it is to show what is just and right, and not
pervert truth, righteousness, and judgment.

The Sheriffs - תפתיא tiphtaye, from תפת taphath, in Hebrew, שפת
shaphath, "to set in order." Probably civil magistrates.

And all the rulers of the provinces - All other state or civil officers,
not only to grace the solemnity, but to maintain order. My old Bible
renders them: Satrapis, or wise men. Magistratis. Jugis. Duykis,
Tyrauntis, or stronge men. Prefectis, and alle the Princes of Cuntreese.

[Daniel 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">dan 3:4</span></span>

Then a herald cried aloud - כרוזא קרא בחיל caroza kara bechayil, "a
crier called with might." A bedel cried mightili. - Old MS. Bible.

[Daniel 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">dan 3:5</span></span>

The sound of the Cornet - There is not less difficulty in ascertaining
the precise meaning of these musical instruments than there is in the
offices in [Dan 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#002.md). קרנא karna, here
translated cornet, is the common blowing horn, which makes a deep and
hollow sound, as well as one shrill and piercing.

Flute - משרוקיתא mashrokitha, from שרק sharak, to whistle, shriek. A
wind instrument which made a strong and shrill noise, such as the
hautbois or clarionet.

Harp - קיתרס kithros, cytharus; κιθαρα. Some kind of stringed
instrument. It seems to be formed from the Greek word.

Sackbut - סבכא sabbecha. The Greek has it σαμβυκη, from which our word
sackbut, from סבך sabach, to interweave; probably on account of the
number of chords, for it seems to have been a species of harp.

Psaltery - פסנתרין pesanterin; Greek, ψαλτηριον. A stringed instrument,
struck with a plectrum; that called santeer in Egypt is probably the
same. Dr. Russel says: "It is a large triangle, and has two bottoms two
inches from each other, with about twenty catguts of different sizes."
It was the ancient psalterium, and most probably the same as David's
harp.

Dulcimer - סומפניה sumponeyah; Greek, συμφωνεια. Probably a kind of
tamboor, tambourine, or tomtom drum. It does not mean the same as the
Greek symphonia, which signifies a concert or harmony of many
instruments, for here one kind of instrument only is intended.

All kinds of music - כל זני זמרא col zeney zemara, the whole stock, or
band, of music; the preceding being the chief, the most common, and the
most sonorous. My old MS. Bible has, Trumpe, and Pipe, and Harpe:
Sambuke, Santrie, and Synfonye, and al kynde of musykes.

[Daniel 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">dan 3:6</span></span>

Shall the same hour - This is the first place in the Old Testament where
we find the division of time into hours. The Greeks say that Anaximander
was the inventor. He had it probably from the Chaldeans, among whom this
division was in use long before Anaximander was born.

Be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace - This was an ancient
mode of punishment among the Chaldeans, if we may credit the tradition
that Abram was cast into such a fire by this idolatrous people because
he would not worship their idols.

[Daniel 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">dan 3:8</span></span>

Accused the Jews - That is, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. The other
Jews were left unnoticed; and probably at this time Daniel was too high
to be touched; but we may rest assured that he was not found among these
idolaters, see [Dan 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#012.md).

[Daniel 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">dan 3:16</span></span>

We are not careful - We have no need to put thee to any farther trouble;
we have made up our minds on this subject, and have our answer ready: Be
it known unto thee, We Will Not Serve Thy Gods. This was as honest as it
was decisive.

[Daniel 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">dan 3:17</span></span>

If it be so - Thou mayest cast us into the furnace; the terror of it has
no effect on our minds to induce us to alter the resolution we have
taken, nor shall the fire change our purpose. We serve a God who is able
to deliver us. Should he not, we are equally determined; but we are
satisfied that in some way or other he will deliver us out of thy hand.
Thy power cannot affect us in the kingdom of our God to which we shall
ascend from thy furnace, should he permit the fire to kindle upon us.
"Render to Caesar the things which are Caesar's," is a maxim of Jesus
Christ; but when Caesar arrogates to himself the things that are the
Lord's, then, and in such cases, his authority is to be resisted. God
does not desire Caesar's things; Caesar's must not have the things of
God.

[Daniel 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">dan 3:19</span></span>

Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury - How strange is this, after having
had so many proofs of the supremacy of Jehovah! He had seen how God
poured contempt upon his authority in the case of the three Hebrews, and
yet he will try his strength once more! How infatuated is man!

Seven times more - As hot as it could be made. Seven expresses the great
intensity of the heat.

[Daniel 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">dan 3:20</span></span>

The most mighty men - The generals, or chief officers of his army; not
strong men, there was no need of such.

[Daniel 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">dan 3:21</span></span>

Their hats - This word, hat, is found only in this place in the Old
Testament. The word סרבל sarbal properly means an outer garment.
Herodotus, who lived about one hundred years after Daniel, says, "the
dress of the Babylonians consisted of a tunic of linen reaching down to
the feet; over this a tunic of woollen; and over all a white short cloak
or mantle, χλανιδιον; and on their heads they wore turbans, μιτρησι."
Following this, Mr. Parkhurst translates the verse thus: "Then these
three men were bound \[בסרבליהון besarbaleyhon\] in their Cloaks,
\[פמישיהון patesheyhon\] their Turbans, \[וכרבלתהון vecharbelathehon\]
and in their Upper (woollen) Tunics, \[ולבושיהון ulebushehon\] and their
Under (linen) Tunics." And as, according to this interpretation, their
סרבלי sarbaley were their outermost garments, we see the propriety with
which it is observed at [Dan 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#027.md) that
these were not changed by the fire.

[Daniel 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">dan 3:23</span></span>

And these three men - fell down bound - There is a most evident want of
connection between this and the following verse; and it is between these
verses that the apocryphal Song of the Three Children, as it is called,
has been inserted by St. Jerome and others; but with this note: Quae
sequuntur in Hebraeis voluminibus non reperi; "What follows I have not
found in the Hebrew books." And then begins, "They walked in the midst
of the flame, praising God, and blessing the Lord." The Septuagint and
Arabic read the twenty-fourth verse thus: "Then Nebuchadnezzar heard
them singing praise, and was astonished." To connect the two verses
Houbigant adds two verses found in the Vulgate, which are the
forty-ninth and the twenty-third: "But an angel of the Lord went down
with Azariah and his companions into the furnace, and drove out the
flame of fire from the furnace; and they walked in the midst of the
furnace." This verse (the forty-ninth) has been added to show the reason
of Nebuchadnezzar's astonishment, and also to account for the appearance
of a fourth person in the furnace, as in verse 25.

[Daniel 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">dan 3:25</span></span>

Is like the Son of God - A most improper translation. What notion could
this idolatrous king have of the Lord Jesus Christ? for so the place is
understood by thousands. בר אלהין bar elahin signifies a son of the
gods, that is, a Divine person or angel; and so the king calls him in
[Dan 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#028.md) : "God hath sent his Angel,
and delivered his servants." And though even from this some still
contend that it was the Angel of the covenant, yet the Babylonish king
knew just as much of the one as he did of the other. No other
ministration was necessary; a single angel from heaven was quite
sufficient to answer this purpose, as that which stopped the mouths of
the lions when Daniel was cast into their den.

[Daniel 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">dan 3:27</span></span>

Upon whose bodies the fire had no power - The heathens boasted that
their priests could walk on burning coals unhurt; and Virgil mentions
this of the priests of Apollo of Soracte: -

Summe Deum, sancti custos Soractis Apollo!

Quem primi colimus, cui pineus ardor acervo

Pascitur; et medium, freti pietate, per ignem

Cultores multa premimus vestigia pruna.

Virg. Aen. 11:785.

O Phoebus, guardian of Soracte's woods

And shady hills; a god above the gods;

To whom our natives pay the rites divine,

And burn whole crackling groves of hallowed pine;

Walk through the fire in honor of thy name,

Unhurt, unsinged, and sacred from the flame.

Pitts.

But Varro tells us that they anointed the soles of their feet with a
species of unguent that preserved them from being burnt. Very lately a
female showed many feats of this kind, putting red hot iron upon her
arms, breasts, etc., and passing it over her hair without the slightest
inconvenience; but in the case of the three Hebrews all was
supernatural, and the king and his officers well knew it.

[Daniel 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">dan 3:28</span></span>

Blessed be the God of Shadrach, etc. - Here is a noble testimony from a
heathen. And what produced it? The intrepidly pious conduct of these
three noble Jews. Had they been time-servers, the name of the true God
had not been known in Babylon. What honor does the Lord put on them that
are steadfast in the faith!

[Daniel 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">dan 3:29</span></span>

Speak any thing amiss - Though by the decree the king does not oblige
the people to worship the true God, yet he obliges them to treat him
with reverence.

[Daniel 3:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">dan 3:30</span></span>

Then the king promoted, etc. - He restored them to the offices which
they held before the charge of disobedience and treason was brought
against them.

At the end of this verse the Septuagint add, "And he advanced them to be
governors over all the Jews that were in his kingdom." This may be the
meaning of the latter verse. They were more likely to be set over the
Jews than over the Chaldeans.
