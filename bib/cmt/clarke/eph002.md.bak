### [Ephesians Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#001.md)

[Ephesians](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eph 2:0</span></span>

The character of the Ephesians previously to their conversion to
Christianity, [Eph 2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#001.md). By what
virtue they were changed, and for what purpose, [Eph
2:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#004.md). They were saved by faith, [Eph
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#008.md), [Eph
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#009.md). And created unto good works, [Eph
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010.md). The apostle enters into the
particulars of their former miserable state, [Eph
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#011.md), [Eph
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012.md). And those of their present happy
state, [Eph 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#013.md). Christ has broken
down the middle wall of partition between the Jews and Gentiles, and
proclaims reconciliation to both, [Eph
2:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014.md). The glorious privileges of
genuine believers, [Eph 2:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#018.md).

[Ephesians 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eph 2:1</span></span>

And you hath he quickened - This chapter should not have been separated
from the preceding, with which it is most intimately connected. As
Christ fills the whole body of Christian believers with his fullness,
([Eph 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#023).md), so had he dealt with the
converted Ephesians, who before were dead in trespasses, and dead in
sins. Death is often used by all writers, and in all nations, to express
a state of extreme misery. The Ephesians, by trespassing and sinning,
had brought themselves into a state of deplorable wretchedness, as had
all the heathen nations; and having thus sinned against God, they were
condemned by him, and might be considered as dead in law - incapable of
performing any legal act, and always liable to the punishment of death,
which they had deserved, and which was ready to be inflicted upon them.

Trespasses, παραπτωμασι, may signify the slightest deviation from the
line and rule of moral equity, as well as any flagrant offense; for
these are equally transgressions, as long as the sacred line that
separates between vice and virtue is passed over.

Sins, ἁμαρτιαις, may probably mean here habitual transgression; sinning
knowingly and daringly.

[Ephesians 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eph 2:2</span></span>

Wherein in time past ye walked - There is much force in these
expressions; the Ephesians had not sinned casually, or now and then, but
continually; it was their continual employment; they walked in
trespasses and sins: and this was not a solitary case, all the nations
of the earth acted in the same way; it was the course of this world,
κατα τον αιωνα του κοσμου τουτου, according to the life, mode of living,
or successive ages of this world. The word αιων, the literal meaning of
which is constant duration, is often applied to things which have a
complete course, as the Jewish dispensation, a particular government,
and the term of human life; so, here, the whole of life is a tissue of
sin, from the cradle to the grave; every human soul, unsaved by Jesus
Christ, continues to transgress. And the nominally Christian world is in
the same state to the present day. Age after age passes on in this way
and the living lay it not to heart!

The prince of the power of the air - As the former clause may have
particular respect to the Jewish people, who are frequently denominated
עולם הזה olam hazzeh, this world, this latter clause may especially
refer to the Gentiles, who were most manifestly under the power of the
devil, as almost every object of their worship was a demon, to whom the
worst of passions and practices were attributed, and whose conduct his
votaries took care to copy.

Satan is termed prince of the power of the air, because the air is
supposed to be a region in which malicious spirits dwell, all of whom
are under the direction and influence of Satan, their chief.

The spirit that now worketh - Του νυν ενεργουντος The operations of the
prince of the aerial powers are not confined to that region; he has
another sphere of action, viz. the wicked heart of man, and in this he
works with energy. He seldom inspires indifference to religion; the
subjects in whom he works are either determinate opposers of true
religion, or they are systematic and energetic transgressors of God's
laws.

Children of disobedience - Perhaps a Hebraism for disobedient children;
but, taken as it stands here, it is a strong expression, in which
disobedience, ἡ απειθεια, appears to be personified, and wicked men
exhibited as her children; the prince of the power of the air being
their father, while disobedience is their mother. Thus they are
emphatically, what our Lord calls them, [Mat
13:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#038.md), children of the wicked one; for
they show themselves to be of their father the devil, because they will
do his works, [Joh 8:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044.md). Some think
that by children of disobedience the apostle means particularly the
disobedient, unbelieving, refractory, and persecuting Jews; but I rather
think he speaks this generally, and refers to the Jews in the following
verse.

[Ephesians 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eph 2:3</span></span>

Among whom also we all had our conversation - We Jews, as well as you
Gentiles, have lived in transgressions and sins; ανεστραφημεν, this was
the course of our life; we lived in sin, walked in sin, it was woven
through our whole constitution, it tinged every temper, polluted every
faculty, and perverted every transaction of life. The lusts - the evil,
irregular, and corrupt affections of the heart, showed themselves in the
perversion of the mind as well as in our general conduct. The mind was
darkened by the lusts of the flesh, and both conjoined to produce acts
of unrighteousness. It was not the will of God that was done by us, but
the will of the flesh and of the mind.

And were by nature the children of wrath - For the import of the phrase,
by nature, φυσει, see the note on [Gal
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#015.md), and [Rom
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#014) (note.md). To what is said on those
passages, I may add, from Dr. Macknight: - "Nature often signifies one's
birth and education, [Gal 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#015.md) : We,
who are Jews By Nature. Also, men's natural reason and conscience, [Rom
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#014.md) : The Gentiles who have not the
law, do By Nature the things contained in the law, etc. Also, the
general sense and practice of mankind, [Co1
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#014.md) : Doth not even Nature itself
teach you, that if a man have long hair, etc. Also, the original
constitution of any thing, [Gal 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#008.md) :
Who are not gods By Nature, Also, a disposition formed by custom and
habit; thus Demetrius Phalereus said of the Lacedemonians: φυσει
εβραχυλογουν Λακωνες· The Lacedemonians had naturally a concise mode of
speaking. Hence our word laconic; a short speech, or much sense conveyed
in a few words." The words in the text have often been quoted to prove
the doctrine of original sin, but, though that doctrine be an awful
truth, it is not, in my opinion, intended here; it is rather found in
the preceding words, the lusts of the flesh, and the desires of the
flesh and of the mind. The apostle appears to speak of sinful habits;
and as we say Habit is a second nature, and as these persons acted from
their originally corrupt nature - from the lusts of the flesh and of the
mind, they thus became, by their vicious habits, or second nature,
children of wrath - persons exposed to perdition, because of the
impurity of their hearts and the wickedness of their lives. Here we see
that the fallen, apostate nature produces the fruits of unrighteousness.
The bad tree produces bad fruit.

Children of wrath is the same as son of perdition, son of death, etc.;
i.e. persons exposed to God's displeasure, because of their sins.

[Ephesians 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eph 2:4</span></span>

But God, who is rich in mercy - As they were corrupt in their nature,
and sinful in their practice, they could possess no merit, nor have any
claim upon God; and it required much mercy to remove so much misery, and
to pardon such transgressions.

His great love - God's infinite love is the groundwork of our salvation;
in reference to us that love assumes the form of mercy, and that mercy
provides the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. And therefore the apostle
adds, [Eph 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#005.md) : By grace ye are saved
- it is by God's free mercy in Christ that ye are brought into this
state of salvation. See on [Eph 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#008.md)
(note).

[Ephesians 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eph 2:5</span></span>

Even when we were dead in sins - Dead in our souls; dead towards God;
dead in law; and exposed to death eternal,

Hath quickened us together with Christ - God has given us as complete a
resurrection from the death of sin to a life of righteousness, as the
body of Christ has had from the grave. And as this quickening, or making
alive, was most gratuitous on God's part, the apostle, with great
propriety, says; By grace ye are saved.

[Ephesians 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eph 2:6</span></span>

And hath raised us up together in Christ - Or rather, by Christ; his
resurrection being the proof that he had made the full atonement, and
that we might be justified by his blood. Believing, therefore, the
record which God gave of his Son, we received this atonement, and were
raised from a death of sin to a life of righteousness; and now we sit in
heavenly places - we have a right to the kingdom of God, anticipate this
glory, and are indescribably happy in the possession of this salvation,
and in our fellowship with Christ Jesus.

[Ephesians 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eph 2:7</span></span>

That in the ages to come - God has produced us an example, and one which
shall be on record through all generations, that he quickens dead souls;
that he forgives the sins of the most sinful, when they repent and
believe in Christ Jesus. So that what God has done for the sinners at
Ephesus will serve as an encouragement to all ages of the world; and on
this evidence every preacher of the Gospel may boldly proclaim that
Christ saves unto the uttermost all that come unto God through him. And
thus the exceeding riches of his grace will appear in the provision he
has made for the salvation of both Jews and Gentiles.

This observation of the apostle is of great use and importance; because
we are authorized to state, in all the successive ages of the world,
that he who saved the sinners at Ephesus is ever ready to save all who,
like them, repent of their sins, and believe in Christ Jesus.

[Ephesians 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eph 2:8</span></span>

For by grace are ye saved, through faith - As ye are now brought into a
state of salvation, your sins being all blotted out, and you made
partakers of the Holy Spirit; and, having a hope full of immortality,
you must not attribute this to any works or merit of yours; for when
this Gospel reached you, you were all found dead in trespasses and dead
in sins; therefore it was God's free mercy to you, manifested through
Christ, in whom ye were commanded to believe; and, having believed by
the power of the Holy Spirit, ye received, and were sealed by, the Holy
Spirit of promise; so that this salvation is in no sense of yourselves,
but is the free gift of God; and not of any kind of works; so that no
man can boast as having wrought out his own salvation, or even
contributed any thing towards it. By grace arc ye saved, through faith
in Christ. This is a true doctrine, and continues to be essential to the
salvation of man to the end of the world.

But whether are we to understand, faith or salvation as being the gift
of God? This question is answered by the Greek text: τῃ γαρ χαριτι εστε
σεσωσμενοι δια της πιστεως· και τουτο ουκ εξ ὑμων· Θεου το δωρον, ουκ εξ
εργων· ἱνα μη τις καυχησηται· "By this grace ye are saved through faith;
and This (τουτο, this salvation) not of you; it is the gift of God, not
of works: so that no one can boast." "The relative τουτο, this, which is
in the neuter gender, cannot stand for πιστις, faith, which is the
feminine; but it has the whole sentence that goes before for its
antecedent." But it may be asked: Is not faith the gift of God? Yes, as
to the grace by which it is produced; but the grace or power to believe,
and the act of believing, are two different things. Without the grace or
power to believe no man ever did or can believe; but with that power the
act of faith is a man's own. God never believes for any man, no more
than he repents for him: the penitent, through this grace enabling him,
believes for himself: nor does he believe necessarily, or impulsively
when he has that power; the power to believe may be present long before
it is exercised, else, why the solemn warnings with which we meet every
where in the word of God, and threatenings against those who do not
believe? Is not this a proof that such persons have the power but do not
use it? They believe not, and therefore are not established. This,
therefore, is the true state of the case: God gives the power, man uses
the power thus given, and brings glory to God: without the power no man
can believe; with it, any man may.

[Ephesians 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eph 2:10</span></span>

For we are his workmanship - So far is this salvation from being our own
work, or granted for our own works' sake, that we are ourselves not only
the creatures of God, but our new creation was produced by his power;
for we are created in Christ Jesus unto good works. He has saved us that
we may show forth the virtues of Him who called us from darkness into
his marvelous light. For though we are not saved for our good works, yet
we are saved that we may perform good works, to the glory of God and the
benefit of man.

Which God hath before ordained - Οἱς προητοιμασες· For which God before
prepared us, that we might walk in them. For being saved from sin we are
made partakers of the Spirit of holiness; and it is natural to that
Spirit to lead to the practice of holiness; and he who is not holy in
his life is not saved by the grace of Christ. The before ordaining, or
rather preparing, must refer to the time when God began the new creation
in their hearts; for from the first inspiration of God upon the soul it
begins to love holiness; and obedience to the will of God is the very
element in which a holy or regenerated soul lives.

[Ephesians 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eph 2:11</span></span>

Wherefore remember - That ye may ever see and feel your obligations to
live a pure and holy life, and be unfeignedly thankful to God for your
salvation, remember that ye were once heathens in the flesh - without
the pure doctrine, and under the influence of your corrupt nature; such
as by the Jew's (who gloried, in consequence of their circumcision, to
be in covenant with God) were called uncircumcision; i.e. persons out of
the Divine covenant, and having no right or title to any blessing of
God.

[Ephesians 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eph 2:12</span></span>

That at that time ye were without Christ - Not only were not Christians,
but had no knowledge of the Christ or Messiah, and no title to the
blessings which were to proceed from him.

Aliens from the commonwealth of Israel - Ye were by your birth,
idolatry, etc., alienated from the commonwealth of Israel - from the
civil and religious privileges of the Jewish people.

Strangers from the covenants of promise - Having no part in the promise
of the covenant made with Abraham, whether considered as relating to his
natural or spiritual seed; and no part in that of the covenant made at
Horeb with the Israelites, when a holy law was given them, and God
condescended to dwell among them, and to lead them to the promised land.

Having no hope - Either of the pardon of sin or of the resurrection of
the body, nor indeed of the immortality of the soul. Of all these things
the Gentiles had no rational or well-grounded hope.

Without God in the world - They had gods many, and lords many; but in no
Gentile nation was the true God known: nor indeed had they any correct
notion of the Divine nature. Their idols were by nature no gods - they
could neither do evil nor good, and therefore they were properly without
God, having no true object of worship, and no source of comfort. He who
has neither God nor Christ is in a most deplorable state; he has neither
a God to worship, nor a Christ to justify him. And this is the state of
every man who is living without the grace and Spirit of Christ. All
such, whatever they may profess, are no better than practical atheists.

[Ephesians 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eph 2:13</span></span>

Ye who sometimes were far off - To be far off, and to be near, are
sayings much in use among the Jews; and among them, to be near
signifies,

1\. To be in the approbation or favor of God; and to be far off
signifies to be under his displeasure. So a wicked Jew might be said to
be far off from God when he was exposed to his displeasure; and a holy
man, or a genuine penitent, might be said to be nigh to God, because
such persons are in his favor.

2\. Every person who offered a sacrifice to God was considered as having
access to him by the blood of that sacrifice: hence the priests, whose
office it was to offer sacrifices, were considered as being nigh to God;
and all who brought gifts to the altar were considered as approaching
the Almighty.

3\. Being far off, signified the state of the Gentiles as
contradistinguished from the Jews, who were nigh. And these expressions
were used in reference to the tabernacle, God's dwelling-place among the
Israelites, and the sacrifices there offered. All those who had access
to this tabernacle, or were nigh to it or encamped about it, were said
to be nigh to God; those who had no access to it were said to be far
off.

Hence the latter phrase is used to distinguish the Gentiles from the
Jewish people; and this appears to be the meaning of the prophet, [Isa
57:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#019.md) : I create the fruit of the
lips; Peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near,
saith the Lord; i.e. I give cause of praise and rejoicing to the Gentile
as well as to the Jew. And to this scripture, and to this thing, the
apostle seems here to allude. You Gentiles, who were unacquainted with
God, and were even without God in the world, are brought to an
acquaintance with him; and are now, through Christ Jesus, brought into
the favor and fellowship of God. And as the Jews of old approached God
by the blood of their sacrifices, so you approach him by the blood of
Christ.

[Ephesians 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eph 2:14</span></span>

For he is our peace - Jesus Christ has died for both Jews and Gentiles,
and has become a peace-offering, שלום shalom, to reconcile both to God
and to each other.

Who hath made both one - Formed one Church out of the believers of both
people.

The middle wall of partition - By abolishing the law of Jewish
ordinances, he has removed that which kept the two parties, not only in
a state of separation, but also at variance.

This expression, the middle wall, can refer only to that most marked
distinction which the Jewish laws and customs made between them and all
other nations whatsoever.

Some think it refers to their ancient manner of living among the
Gentiles, as they always endeavored to live in some place by themselves,
and to have a river or a wall between them and their heathen neighbors.
Indeed, wherever they went, their own rites, ordinances, and customs
were a sufficient separation between them and others; and as Jesus
Christ abolished those customs, admitting all into his Church, both Jews
and Gentiles, by repentance and faith, he may be said to have broken
down the middle wall of partition. When, at the death of Christ, the
veil of the temple was rent from the top to the bottom, it was an emblem
that the way to the holiest was laid open, and that the people at large,
both Jews and Gentiles, were to have access to the holiest by the blood
of Jesus.

Some think there is an allusion here to the wall called chel, which
separated the court of Israel from the court of the Gentiles; but this
was not broken down till the temple itself was destroyed: and to this
transaction the apostle cannot be supposed to allude, as it did not take
place till long after the writing of this epistle.

[Ephesians 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eph 2:15</span></span>

Having abolished in his flesh - By his incarnation and death he not only
made an atonement for sin, but he appointed the doctrine of
reconciliation to God, and of love to each other, to be preached in all
nations; and thus glory was brought to God in the highest, and on earth,
peace and good will were diffused among men.

The enmity of which the apostle speaks was reciprocal among the Jews and
Gentiles. The former detested the Gentiles, and could hardly allow them
the denomination of men; the latter had the Jews in the most sovereign
contempt, because of the peculiarity of their religious rites and
ceremonies, which were different from those of all the other nations of
the earth.

The law of commandments - Contained in, or rather concerning,
ordinances; which law was made merely for the purpose of keeping the
Jews a distinct people, and pointing out the Son of God till he should
come. When, therefore, the end of its institution was answered, it was
no longer necessary; and Christ by his death abolished it.

To make in himself - To make one Church out of both people, which should
be considered the body of which Jesus Christ is the head. Thus he makes
one new man - one new Church; and thus he makes and establishes peace. I
think the apostle still alludes to the peace-offering, שלום shalom,
among the Jews. They have a saying, Sephra, fol. 121: Whosoever offers a
peace-offering sacrifice, brings peace to the world. Such a
peace-offering was the death of Christ, and by it peace is restored to
the earth.

[Ephesians 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eph 2:16</span></span>

That he might reconcile both - in one body - That the Jews and Gentiles,
believing on the Lord Jesus, might lay aside all their causes of
contention, and become one spiritual body, or society of men, influenced
by the Spirit, and acting according to the precepts of the Gospel.

Having slain the enmity thereby - Having, by his death upon the cross,
made reconciliation between God and man, and by his Spirit in their
hearts removed the enmity of their fallen, sinful nature. Dr. Macknight
thinks that abolishing the enmity is spoken of the removal of the hatred
which the Jews and Gentiles mutually bore to each other, because of the
difference of their respective religious worship; and that slaying the
enmity refers to the removal of evil lusts and affections from the heart
of man, by the power of Divine grace. This is nearly the sense given
above.

[Ephesians 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eph 2:17</span></span>

And came and preached peace - Proclaimed the readiness of God to forgive
and save both Jews and Gentiles. See the note on [Eph
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#013.md).

[Ephesians 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eph 2:18</span></span>

For through him - Christ Jesus, we both - Jews and Gentiles, have access
by one Spirit - through the influence of the Holy Ghost, unto the Father
- God Almighty. This text is a plain proof of the holy Trinity. Jews and
Gentiles are to be presented unto God the Father; the Spirit of God
works in their hearts, and prepares them for this presentation; and
Jesus Christ himself introduces them. No soul can have access to God but
by Jesus Christ, and he introduces none but such as receive his Holy
Spirit. All who receive that Spirit are equally dear to him; and,
whatever their names be among men, they are known in heaven as children
of God, and heirs of eternal glory.

[Ephesians 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eph 2:19</span></span>

Ye are no more strangers - In this chapter the Church of God is compared
to a city, which, has a variety of privileges, rights, etc., founded on
regular charters and grants. The Gentiles, having believed in Christ,
are all incorporated with the believing Jews in this holy city.
Formerly, when any of them came to Jerusalem, being ξενοι, strangers,
they had no kind of rights whatever; nor could they, as mere heathens,
settle among them. Again, if any of them, convinced of the errors of the
Gentiles, acknowledged the God of Israel, but did not receive
circumcision, he might dwell in the land, but he had no right to the
blessings of the covenant; such might be called παροικοι, sojourners -
persons who have no property in the land, and may only rent a house for
the time being.

Fellow citizens with the saints - Called to the enjoyment of equal
privileges with the Jews themselves, who, by profession, were a holy
people; who were bound to be holy, and therefore are often called
saints, or holy persons, when both their hearts and conduct were far
from being right in the sight of God. But the saints spoken of here are
the converted or Christianized Jews.

Of the household of God - The house of God is the temple; the temple was
a type of the Christian Church; this is now become God's house; all
genuine believers are considered as being οικειοι, domestics, of this
house, the children and servants of God Almighty, having all equal
rights, privileges, and advantages; as all, through one Spirit, by the
sacred head of the family, had equal access to God, and each might
receive as much grace and as much glory as his soul could possibly
contain.

[Ephesians 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eph 2:20</span></span>

And are built upon the foundation - Following the same metaphor,
comparing the Church of Christ to a city, and to the temple, the
believing Ephesians are represented as parts of that building; the
living stones out of which it is principally formed, [Pe1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#004.md), [Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005.md), having for foundation - the
ground plan, specification, and principle on which it was builded, the
doctrine taught by the prophets in the Old Testament, and the apostles
in the New. Jesus Christ being that corner stone, or ακρογωνιαιος, the
chief angle or foundation corner stone, the connecting medium by which
both Jews and Gentiles were united in the same building. Elsewhere Jesus
Christ is termed the foundation stone. Behold I lay in Zion a foundation
stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, [Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016.md); but the meaning is the same in
all the places where these terms, foundation and corner stone, occur;
for in laying the foundation of a building, a large stone is generally
placed at one of the angles or corners, which serves to form a part of
the two walls which meet in that angle. When, therefore, the apostle
says that Jesus Christ is the chief corner stone, it means such a
foundation stone as that above mentioned.

[Ephesians 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eph 2:21</span></span>

In whom - By which foundation corner stone, Christ Jesus, all the
building, composed of converted Jews and Gentiles, fitly framed
together, συναρμολογουμενη, properly jointed and connected together,
groweth unto a holy temple - is continually increasing, as new converts
from Judaism or heathenism flock into it. It is not a finished building,
but will continue to increase, and be more and more perfect, till the
day of judgment.

[Ephesians 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eph 2:22</span></span>

In whom ye also are builded - The apostle now applies the metaphor to
the purpose for which he produced it, retaining however some of the
figurative expressions. As the stones in a temple are all properly
placed so as to form a complete house, and be a habitation for the Deity
that is worshipped there, so ye are all, both believing Jews and
Gentiles, prepared by the doctrine of the prophets and apostles, under
the influence of the Spirit of Christ, to become a habitation of God, a
Church in which God shall be worthily worshipped, and in which he can
continually dwell.

1\. Many suppose that the apostle in the preceding chapter alludes to
the splendor of the temple of Diana at Ephesus, which was reputed one of
the wonders of the world. But to me this opinion does not seem
sufficiently founded. I believe he has the Jewish temple continually in
view; for that temple, above all in the universe, could alone be said to
be a habitation of God. Both in the tabernacle and temple God dwelt
between the cherubim; there was the symbol of his presence, and there
was the worship performed which himself had prescribed. After the model
of this was the spiritual temple, the Christian Church, constructed; and
God was to dwell in the one, as he had dwelt in the other. This simile,
drawn from the temple at Jerusalem, was alone worthy of the apostle's
design; to have alluded to the temple of Diana would have disgraced his
subject. And as many at Ephesus were Jews, and well acquainted with the
temple at Jerusalem, they would both feel and venerate the apostle's
simile, and be led to look for the indwelling of God; that which
distinguished the Jewish temple from all others on the face of the
earth.

2\. The Church of God is very properly said to be a most noble and
wonderful work, and truly worthy of God himself.

There is nothing, says one, so august as this Church, seeing it is the
temple of God.

Nothing so worthy of reverence, seeing God dwells in it.

Nothing so ancient, since the patriarchs and prophets labored in
building it.

Nothing so solid, since Jesus Christ is the foundation of it.

Nothing more closely united and indivisible, since he is the corner
stone.

Nothing so lofty, since it reaches as high as heaven, and to the bosom
of God himself.

Nothing so regular and well proportioned, since the Holy Spirit is the
architect.

Nothing more beautiful, or adorned with greater variety, since it
consists of Jews and Gentiles, of every age, country, sex, and
condition: the mightiest potentates, the most renowned lawgivers, the
most profound philosophers, the most eminent scholars, besides all those
of whom the world was not worthy, have formed a part of this building.

Nothing more spacious, since it is spread over the whole earth, and
takes in all who have washed their robes, and made them white in the
blood of the Lamb.

Nothing so inviolable, since it is consecrated to Jehovah.

Nothing so Divine, since it is a living building, animated and inhabited
by the Holy Ghost.

Nothing so beneficent, seeing it gives shelter to the poor, the
wretched, and distressed, of every nation, and kindred, and tongue.

It is the place in which God does his marvelous works; the theater of
his justice, mercy, goodness, and truth; where he is to be sought, where
he is to be found, and in which alone he is to he retained.

As we have one only God, and one only Savior and Mediator between God
and man, and one only inspiring Spirit; so there is but one Church, in
which this ineffable Jehovah performs his work of salvation. That
Church, however scattered and divided throughout the world, is but one
building, founded on the Old and New Testaments; having but one
sacrifice, the Lord Jesus, the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of
the world.

3\. Of this glorious Church every Christian soul is an epitome; for as
God dwells in the Church at large, so he dwells in every believer in
particular: each is a habitation of God through the Spirit. In vain are
all pretensions among sects and parties to the privileges of the Church
of Christ, if they have not the doctrine and life of Christ. Traditions
and legends are not apostolic doctrines, and showy ceremonies are not
the life of God in the soul of man.

4\. Religion has no need of human ornaments or trappings; it shines by
its own light, and is refulgent with its own glory. Where it is not in
life and power, men have endeavored to produce a specious image, dressed
and ornamented with their own hands. Into this God never breathed,
therefore it can do no good to man, and only imposes on the ignorant and
credulous by a vain show of lifeless pomp and splendor. This phantom,
called true religion and the Church by its votaries, is in heaven
denominated vain superstition; the speechless symbol of departed piety.
