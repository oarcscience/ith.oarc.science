### [2 Chronicles Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 11:0</span></span>

Rehoboam raises an array, purposing to reduce the ten tribes; but is
prevented by Shemaiah the prophet, [Ch2
11:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#001.md). He builds several cities of
defense, and fortifies others, [Ch2
11:5-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#005.md). The priests and Levites being
turned out by Jeroboam, come to Rehoboam, [Ch2
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#013.md), [Ch2
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#014.md). Jeroboam's gross idolatry, [Ch2
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#015.md). The pious of the land join with
Judah, and strengthen the kingdom of Rehoboam, [Ch2
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#016.md), [Ch2
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#017.md). His wives, concubines, and
numerous issue, [Ch2 11:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#018.md). He
places his own sons for governors in the different provinces, [Ch2
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#022.md), [Ch2
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#023.md).

[2 Chronicles 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 11:1</span></span>

Gathered of the house of Judah - See this account [Kg1
12:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#021) (note.md), and the notes there.

[2 Chronicles 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 11:5</span></span>

And built cities for defense in Judah - He was obliged to strengthen his
frontiers against the encroachments of the men of Israel; and Jeroboam
did the same thing on his part to prevent the inroads of Judah. See [Kg1
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#025.md).

[2 Chronicles 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 11:11</span></span>

Store of victual - In these places he laid up stores of provisions, not
only to enable them to endure a siege; but also that they might be able,
from their situation, to supply desolate places.

[2 Chronicles 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 11:14</span></span>

The Levites left their suburbs - They and the priests were expelled from
their offices by Jeroboam, lest they should turn the hearts of the
people to the true God, and then they would revolt to Judah, [Kg1
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#026.md); and therefore he established a
new worship, and made new gods.

[2 Chronicles 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 11:15</span></span>

And he ordained him priests - for the devils - שעירים seirim, the hairy
ones; probably goats: for as the golden calves, or oxen, were in
imitation of the Egyptian ox-god, Apis; so they no doubt paid Divine
honors to the goat, which we know was an object of religious veneration
in Egypt.

[2 Chronicles 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 11:16</span></span>

Such as set their hearts to seek the Lord - All the truly pious joined
him out of every tribe, and the whole tribe of Levi, being deprived of
their functions, joined him also. Thus he had Judah, Benjamin, and Levi,
and probably a part of Simeon; for he had Etam, which was in that tribe,
and the truly religious out of all the other tribes, for they could not
bear Jeroboam's idolatry.

[2 Chronicles 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 11:17</span></span>

For three years they walked in the way of David - During this time he
prospered; but for fourteen years after this he and the people were
unfaithful to the Lord, except at such intervals as the hand of God's
judgments was upon them.

[2 Chronicles 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 11:18</span></span>

Took him Mahalath - By marrying thus in the family of David, he
strengthened his right to the Jewish throne.

[2 Chronicles 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 11:20</span></span>

Maachah the daughter of Absalom - See the note on [Kg1
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#010.md). She is called Michaiah, the
daughter of Uriel, [Ch2 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#002.md). For this
the Targum gives the following reason: "Abijah reigned three years in
Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Michaiah, daughter of Uriel of
Gibeatha. She is the same as Michah, the daughter of Absalom; but,
because she was an upright woman, her name was changed into the more
excellent name Michaiah, and her fathers name into that of Uriel of
Gibeatha, that the name of Absalom might not be remembered.

[2 Chronicles 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 11:21</span></span>

Eighteen wives and threescore concubines - Bad enough, but not so
abandoned as his father. Of these marriages and concubinage the issue
was twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters; eighty-eight children in the
whole, to the education of the whole of whom he could pay but little
attention. Numerous families are often neglected; and children by
different women, must be yet in a worse state.

[2 Chronicles 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch2 11:22</span></span>

Made Abijah - the chief - Abijah certainly was not the first-born of
Rehoboam; but as he loved Maachah more than any of his wives, so he
preferred her son, probably through his mother's influence. In [Deu
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#016.md), this sort of preference is
forbidden; but Rehoboam had a sort of precedent in the preference shown
by David to Solomon.

[2 Chronicles 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch2 11:23</span></span>

He dealt wisely - It was true policy to disperse his own sons through
the different provinces who were not likely to form any league with
Jeroboam against their father.

He desired many wives - He was much addicted to women; yet we do not
find that he formed any heathenish alliances of this nature. And as no
particulars are given, we do not know how far he indulged himself in
this propensity. He probably strengthened his political connections by
these means.
