### [2 Chronicles Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 10:0</span></span>

The people apply to Rehoboam to ease them of their burdens, [Ch2
10:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#001). Rejecting the advice of the
aged counsellors, and following that of the young men, he gives them an
ungracious answer, [Ch2 10:5-14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#005). The
people are discouraged, and ten tribes revolt, [Ch2
10:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#015). They stone Hadoram, who went
to collect the tribute; and Rehoboam but barely escapes, [Ch2
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#018), [Ch2
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#019).

[2 Chronicles 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 10:1</span></span>

Rehoboam went to Shechem - This chapter is almost word for word the same
as 1 Kings 12:1-19, to the notes on which the reader is referred.

[2 Chronicles 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 10:10</span></span>

My little finger shall be thicker - "My weakness shall be stronger than
the might of my father." - Targum.

[2 Chronicles 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 10:15</span></span>

For the cause was of God - "For there was an occasion Divinely given." -
Targum.

[2 Chronicles 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 10:16</span></span>

To your tents, O Israel - "To your cities, O Israel." - Targum.

Now, David, see to thine own house - "Now, David, rule over the men of
thy own house." - Targum.

[2 Chronicles 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 10:18</span></span>

Stoned him - When he endeavored to collect the tribute which Solomon had
imposed on them. - Jarchi.

[2 Chronicles 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch2 10:19</span></span>

Israel rebelled - A few soft words, and the removal of a part of the
oppressive taxes, (for they said, Ease thou Somewhat the grievous
servitude), would have secured this people to the state, and prevented
the shedding of a sea of human blood, which was the consequence of the
separation of this kingdom. Rehoboam was a fool; and through his folly
he lost his kingdom. He is not the only example on record: the Stuarts
lost the realm of England much in the same way; and, by a different mode
of treatment, the House of Brunswick continues to fill the British
throne. May the thread of its fortune, woven by the hand of God, never
be undone! and may the current of its power glide on to the latest
posterity!

Talia secla, suis dixerunt, currite, fusis

Concordes stabili fatorum numine Parcae.

Virg. Ecl. iv., ver. 46.

"God's firm decree, by which this web was spun,

Shall ever bless the clue, and bid it smoothly run."

Labitur, et labetur in omne volubilis Aevum.

Horat. Epist., l. i., c. 2, v. 43.

"Still glides the river, and shall ever glide."

Amen! Amen!
