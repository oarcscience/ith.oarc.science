### [Isaiah Chapter 46](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 46:0</span></span>

The idols of Babylon represented as so far from being able to bear the
burden of their votaries, that they themselves are borne by beasts of
burden into captivity, [Isa 46:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001.md), [Isa
46:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#002.md). This beautifully contrasted with
the tender care of God, in bearing his people from first to last in his
arms, and delivering them from their distress, [Isa
46:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#003.md), [Isa
46:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#004.md). The prophet, then, with his
usual force and elegance, goes on to show the folly of idolatry, and the
utter inability of idols, [Isa 46:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#005.md).
From which he passes with great ease to the contemplation of the
attributes and perfections of the true God, [Isa
46:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#008.md). Particularly that prescience
which foretold the deliverance of the Jews from the Babylonish
captivity, with all its leading circumstances; and also that very remote
event of which it is the type in the days of the Messiah, [Isa
46:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#011.md).

[Isaiah 46:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 46:1</span></span>

Their carriages were heavy loaden "Their burdens are heavy" - For
נשאתיכם nesuotheychem, your burdens, the Septuagint had in their copy
נשאתיהם nesuotheyhem, their burdens.

[Isaiah 46:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 46:2</span></span>

They could not deliver the burden "They could not deliver their own
charge" - That is, their worshippers, who ought to have been borne by
them. See the two next verses. The Chaldee and Syriac Versions render it
in effect to the same purpose, those that bear them, meaning their
worshippers; but how they can render משא massa in an active sense, I do
not understand.

For לא lo, not, ולא velo, and they could not, is the reading of
twenty-four of Kennicott's, sixteen of De Rossi's, and two of my own
MSS. The added ו vau gives more elegance to the passage.

But themselves "Even they themselves" - For ונפשם venaphsham, an ancient
MS. has כי נפשם ki naphsham, with more force.

[Isaiah 46:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 46:3</span></span>

Which are borne by me from the belly "Ye that have been borne by me from
the birth" - The prophet very ingeniously, and with great force,
contrasts the power of God, and his tender goodness effectually exerted
towards his people, with the inability of the false gods of the heathen.
He like an indulgent father had carried his people in his arms, "as a
man carrieth his son," [Deu 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#031.md). He
had protected them, and delivered them from their distresses: whereas
the idols of the heathen are forced to be carried about themselves and
removed from place to place, with great labor and fatigue, by their
worshippers; nor can they answer, or deliver their votaries, when they
cry unto them.

Moses, expostulating with God on the weight of the charge laid upon him
as leader of his people, expresses that charge under the same image of a
parent's carrying his children, in very strong terms: "Have I conceived
all this people? have I begotten them? that thou shouldest say unto me,
Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child,
unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers;" [Num
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#012.md).

[Isaiah 46:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 46:7</span></span>

They bear him upon the shoulder - and set him in his place - This is the
way in which the Hindoos carry their gods; and indeed so exact a picture
is this of the idolatrous procession of this people, that the prophet
might almost be supposed to have been sitting among the Hindoos when he
delivered this prophecy. - Ward'S Customs.

Pindar has treated with a just and very elegant ridicule the work of the
statuary even in comparison with his own poetry, from this circumstance
of its being fixed to a certain station. "The friends of Pytheas," says
the Scholiast, "came to the poet, desiring him to write an ode on his
victory. Pindar demanded three drachms, (minae, I suppose it should be),
for the ode. No, say they, we can have a brazen statue for that money,
which will be better than a poem. However, changing their minds
afterwards, they came and offered him what he had demanded." This gave
him the hint of the following ingenious esordium of his ode: -

Ουκ ανδριαντοποιος ειμ'

Ὡστ' ελινυσσοντα μ' εργαζε-

σθαι αγαλματ' επ' αυτας βαθμιδος

Ἑσταοτ.Αλλ' επι πασας

Ὁλκαδος εν τ' ακατῳ γλυκει' αοιδα

Στειχ' απ' Αιγινας διαγγελ-

lois' ὁτι Λαμπωνος ὑιος

Πυθεας ευρυσθενης

Νικῃ Νεμειοις παγκρατιου στεφανον.

Nem. v.

Thus elegantly translated by Mr. Francis in a note to Hor. Carm. 4:2.
19.

"It is not mine with forming hand

To bid a lifeless image stand

For ever on its base:

But fly, my verses, and proclaim

To distant realms, with deathless fame,

That Pytheas conquered in the rapid race."

Jeremiah, [Jer 10:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#003.md), seems to be
indebted to Isaiah for most of the following passage: -

"The practices of the people are altogether vanity:

For they cut down a tree from the forest;

The work of the artificer's hand with the axe;

With silver and with gold it is adorned;

With nails and with hammers it is fastened, that it may not totter.

Like the palm-tree they stand stiff, and cannot speak;

They are carried about, for they cannot go:

Fear them not, for they cannot do harm;

Neither is it in them to do good."

[Isaiah 46:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 46:8</span></span>

Show yourselves men - התאששו hithoshashu. This word is rather of
doubtful derivation and signification. It occurs only in this place: and
some of the ancient interpreters seem to have had something different in
their copies. The Vulgate read התבששו hithbosheshu, take shame to
yourselves; the Syriac התבוננו hithbonenu, consider with yourselves; the
Septuagint στεναξετε· perhaps התאבלו hithabbelu, groan or mourn, within
yourselves. Several MSS. read התאוששו hithosheshu, but without any help
to the sense.

[Isaiah 46:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 46:11</span></span>

Calling a ravenous bird from the east "Calling from the east the eagle"
- A very proper emblem for Cyrus, as in other respects, so particularly
because the ensign of Cyrus was a golden eagle, ΑΕΤΟΣ χρυσους, the very
word עיט ayit, which the prophet uses here, expressed as near as may be
in Greek letters. Xenoph. Cyrop. lib. 7 sub. init. Kimchi says his
father understood this, not of Cyrus, but of the Messiah.

From a far country "From a land far distant" - Two MSS. add the
conjunction ו vau, ומארץ umeerets; and so the Septuagint, Syriac, and
Vulgate.

[Isaiah 46:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 46:12</span></span>

Hearken unto me, ye stout-hearted - This is an address to the
Babylonians, stubbornly bent on the practice of injustice towards the
Israelites.
