### [Proverbs Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">pro 13:0</span></span>

Various moral sentences; the wise child; continence of speech; of the
poor rich man and the rich poor man; ill-gotten wealth; delay of what is
hoped for; the bad consequences of refusing instruction; providing for
one's children; the necessity of correcting them, etc.

[Proverbs 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 13:1</span></span>

A wise son heareth his father's instruction - The child that has had a
proper nurturing, will profit by his father's counsels; but the child
that is permitted to fulfill its own will and have its own way, will
jest at the reproofs of its parents.

[Proverbs 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 13:3</span></span>

He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life - How often have the foolish,
headstrong, and wicked, forfeited their lives by the treasonable or
blasphemous words they have spoken! The government of the tongue is a
rare but useful talent.

But he that openeth wide his lips - He that puts no bounds to his
loquacity, speaks on every subject, and gives his judgment and opinion
on every matter. It has often been remarked that God has, given us two
Eyes, that we may See much; two Ears, that we may Hear much; but has
given us but One tongue, and that fenced in with teeth, to indicate that
though we hear and see much, we should speak but little.

[Proverbs 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 13:4</span></span>

The soul of the sluggard desireth and hath nothing - We often hear many
religious people expressing a desire to have more of the Divine life,
and yet never get forward in it. How is this? The reason is, they
desire, but do not stir themselves up to lay hold upon the Lord. They
are always learning, but never able to come to the knowledge of the
truth. They seek to enter in at the strait gate, but are not able,
because they do not strive.

[Proverbs 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 13:7</span></span>

There is that maketh himself rich - That labors hard to acquire money,
yet hath nothing; his excessive covetousness not being satisfied with
what he possesses, nor permitting him to enjoy with comfort what he has
acquired. The fable of the dog in the manger will illustrate this.

There is that maketh himself poor, yet hath great riches - "As poor,"
said St. Paul, "yet making many rich; as having nothing, yet possessing
all things." The former is the rich poor man; the latter is the poor
rich man.

As the words are here in the hithpael conjugation, which implies reflex
action, or the action performed on one's self, and often signifies
feigning or pretending to be what one is not, or not to be what one is;
the words may be understood of persons who feign or pretend to be either
richer or poorer than they really are, to accomplish some particular
purpose. "There is that feigneth himself to be rich, yet hath nothing;
there is that feigneth himself to be poor, yet hath great riches." Both
these characters frequently occur in life.

[Proverbs 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 13:8</span></span>

The ransom of a man's life - Those who have riches have often much
trouble with them; as they had much trouble to get them, so they have
much trouble to keep them. In despotic countries, a rich man is often
accused of some capital crime, and to save his life, though he may be
quite innocent, is obliged to give up his riches; but the poor, in such
countries, are put to no trouble.

[Proverbs 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 13:9</span></span>

The light of the righteous rejoiceth - They shall have that measure of
prosperity which shall be best for them; but the wicked, howsoever
prosperous for a time, shall be brought into desolation. Light and lamp
in both cases may signify posterity. The righteous shall have a joyous
posterity; but that of the wicked shall be cut off. So [Kg1
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#036.md) : "And unto his son will I give
one tribe, that David my servant may have a light (נר ner, a lamp)
always before me." [Kg1 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#004.md) :
"Nevertheless for David's sake did the Lord give them a lamp, to set up
his son after him." See also [Psa
132:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#017.md), and several other places.

[Proverbs 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 13:10</span></span>

By pride cometh contention - Perhaps there is not a quarrel among
individuals in private life, nor a war among nations, that does not
proceed from pride and ambition. Neither man nor nation will be content
to be less than another; and to acquire the wished-for superiority all
is thrown into general confusion, both in public and private life. It
was to destroy this spirit of pride, that Jesus was manifested in the
extreme of humility and humiliation among men. The salvation of Christ
is a deliverance from pride, and a being clothed with humility. As far
as we are humble, so far we are saved.

[Proverbs 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 13:11</span></span>

Wealth gotten by vanity - Wealth that is not the result of honest
industry and hard labor is seldom permanent. All fortunes acquired by
speculation, lucky hits, and ministering to the pride or luxury of
others, etc., soon become dissipated. They are not gotten in the way of
Providence, and have not God's blessing, and therefore are not
permanent.

[Proverbs 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 13:12</span></span>

Hope deferred maketh the heart sick - When once a good is discovered,
want of it felt, strong desire for the possession excited, and the
promise of attainment made on grounds unsuspected, so that the reality
of the thing and the certainity of the promise are manifest, hope posts
forward to realize the blessing. Delay in the gratification pains the
mind; the increase of the delay prostrates and sickens the heart; and if
delay sickens the heart, ultimate disappointment kills it. But when the
thing desired, hoped for, and expected comes, it is a tree of life, עץ
חיים ets chaiyim, "the tree of lives;" it comforts and invigorates both
body and soul. To the tree of lives, in the midst of the gardens of
paradise, how frequent are the allusions in the writings of Solomon, and
in other parts of the Holy Scriptures! What deep, and perhaps yet
unknown, mysteries were in this tree!

[Proverbs 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 13:13</span></span>

Whoso despiseth the word - The revelation which God has in his mercy
given to man - shall be destroyed; for there is no other way of
salvation but that which it points out.

But he that feareth the commandment - That respects it so as to obey it,
walking as this revelation directs - shall be rewarded; shall find it to
be his highest interest, and shall be in peace or safety, as the Hebrew
word ישלם may be translated.

[Proverbs 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 13:14</span></span>

The law of the wise is a fountain of life - Perhaps it would be better
to translate, "The law is to the wise man a fountain of life." It is the
same to him as the "vein of lives," מקור חיים mekor chaiyim, the great
aorta which transmits the blood from the heart to every part of the
body. There seems to be here an allusion to the garden of paradise, to
the tree of lives, to the tempter, to the baleful issue of that
temptation, and to the death entailed on man by his unwisely breaking
the law of his God.

[Proverbs 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 13:16</span></span>

The way of transgressors is hard - Never was a truer saying; most
sinners have more pain and difficulty to get their souls damned, than
the righteous have, with all their cross-bearings, to get to the kingdom
of heaven.

[Proverbs 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 13:17</span></span>

A wicked messenger - The Septuagint: basileuv yrasuev, a bold king;
instead of מלאך malach, a messenger, they had read מלך melech, a king:
but they are singular in this rendering; none of the other versions have
it so. He that betrays the counsels of his government, or the interests
of his country, will sooner or later fall into mischief; but he that
faithfully and loyally fulfils his mission, shall produce honor and
safety to the commonwealth.

[Proverbs 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 13:19</span></span>

The desire accomplished - See on [Pro
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#012) (note.md).

[Proverbs 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 13:20</span></span>

He that walketh with wise men shall be wise - To walk with a person
implies love and attachment; and it is impossible not to imitate those
we love. So we say, "Show me his company, and I'll tell you the man."
Let me know the company he keeps, and I shall easily guess his moral
character.

[Proverbs 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 13:22</span></span>

A good man leaveth an inheritance - He files many a prayer in heaven in
their behalf, and his good example and advices are remembered and quoted
from generation to generation. Besides, whatever property he left was
honestly acquired, and well-gotten goods are permanent. The general
experience of men shows this to be a common case; and that property
ill-gotten seldom reaches to the third generation. This even the
heathens observed. Hence:

De male quaesitis non gaudet tertius haeres.

"The third generation shall not possess the goods that have been
unjustly acquired."

[Proverbs 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 13:23</span></span>

That is destroyed for want of judgment - O, how much of the poverty of
the poor arises from their own want of management! They have little or
no economy, and no foresight. When they get any thing, they speedily
spend it; and a feast and a famine make the chief varieties of their
life.

[Proverbs 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 13:24</span></span>

He that spareth his rod hateth his son - That is, if he hated him, he
could not do him a greater disservice than not to correct him when his
obstinacy or disobedience requires it. We have met with this subject
already, and it is a favourite with Solomon. See [Psa
34:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#010) (note.md) and [Psa
37:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#003) (note.md).

The Rev. Mr. Holden makes some sensible observations on this passage:
"By the neglect of early correction the desires (passions) obtain
ascendancy; the temper becomes irascible, peevish, querulous. Pride is
nourished, humility destroyed, and by the habit of indulgence the mind
is incapacitated to bear with firmness and equanimity the cares and
sorrows, the checks and disappointments, which flesh is heir to."

[Proverbs 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 13:25</span></span>

To the satisfying of his soul - His desires are all moderate; he is
contented with his circumstances, and is pleased with the lot which God
is pleased to send. The wicked, though he use all shifts and expedients
to acquire earthly good, not sticking even at rapine and wrong, is
frequently in real want, and always dissatisfied with his portion. A
contented mind is a continual feast. At such feasts he eats not.
