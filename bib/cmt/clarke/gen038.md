### [Genesis Chapter 38](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 38:0</span></span>

Judah marries the daughter of a Canaanite, [Gen
38:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#001.md), [Gen
38:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#002.md); and begets of her Er, [Gen
38:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#003.md), Onan, [Gen
38:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#004.md), and Shelah, [Gen
38:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#005.md). Er marries Tamar, [Gen
38:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#006.md); is slain for his wickedness,
[Gen 38:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#007.md). Onan, required to raise up
seed to his brother, refuses, [Gen
38:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#008.md), [Gen
38:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#009.md). He also is slain, [Gen
38:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#010.md). Judah promises his son Shelah
to Tamar, when he should be of age; but performs not his promise, [Gen
38:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#011.md). Judah's wife dies, [Gen
38:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#012.md). Tamar in disguise receives her
father-in-law, he leaves his signet, bracelets, and staff in her hand,
and she conceives by him, [Gen
38:13-23](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#013.md). Judah is informed that his
daughter-in-law is with child; and, not knowing that himself was the
father, condemns her to be burnt, [Gen
38:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#024.md). She produces the signet,
bracelets, and staff, and convicts Judah, [Gen
38:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#025.md), [Gen
38:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#026.md). She is delivered of twins, who
are called Pharez and Zarah, [Gen
38:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#027.md).

[Genesis 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 38:1</span></span>

And it came to pass at that time - The facts mentioned here could not
have happened at the times mentioned in the preceding chapter, as those
times are all unquestionably too recent, for the very earliest of the
transactions here recorded must have occurred long before the selling of
Joseph. Mr. Ainsworth remarks "that Judah and his sons must have married
when very young, else the chronology will not agree. For Joseph was born
six years before Jacob left Laban and came into Canaan; [Gen
30:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#025.md), and [Gen
31:41](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#041.md). Joseph was seventeen years old
when he was sold into Egypt, [Gen
37:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#002.md), [Gen
37:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#025.md); he was thirty years old when he
interpreted Pharaoh's dream, [Gen
41:46](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#046.md). And nine years after, when
there had been seven years of plenty and two years of famine, did Jacob
with his family go down into Egypt, [Gen
41:53](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#053.md), [Gen
41:54](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#054.md), and [Gen
45:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#006.md), [Gen
45:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#011.md). And at their going down
thither, Pharez, the son of Judah, whose birth is set down at the end of
this chapter, had two sons, Hezron and Hamul, [Gen
46:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#008.md), [Gen
46:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#012.md). Seeing then from the selling of
Joseph unto Israel's going down into Egypt there cannot be above
twenty-three years, how is it possible that Judah should take a wife,
and have by her three sons successively, and Shelah the youngest of the
three be marriageable when Judah begat Pharez of Tamar, [Gen
38:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#014.md), [Gen
38:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#024.md), and Pharez be grown up,
married, and have two sons, all within so short a space? The time
therefore here spoken of seems to have been soon after Jacob's coming to
Shechem, [Gen 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#018.md), before the
history of Dinah, Genesis 34, though Moses for special cause relates it
in this place." I should rather suppose that this chapter originally
stood after Genesis 33, and that it got by accident into this place. Dr.
Hales, observing that some of Jacob's son must have married remarkably
young, says that "Judah was about forty-seven years old when Jacob's
family settled in Egypt. He could not therefore have been above fifteen
at the birth of his eldest son Er; nor Er more than fifteen at his
marriage with Tamar; nor could it have been more than two years after
Er's death till the birth of Judah's twin sons by his daughter-in-law
Tamar; nor could Pharez, one of them, be more than fifteen at the birth
of his twin sons Herron and Hamul, supposing they were twins, just born
before the departure from Canaan. For the aggregate of these numbers,
15, 15, 2, 15, or 47 years, gives the age of Judah; compare Genesis 38
with [Gen 46:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#012.md)." See the remarks of
Dr. Kennicott, at [Gen 31:55](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#055) (note.md).
Adullamite - An inhabitant of Adullam, a city of Canaan, afterwards
given for a possession to the sons of Judah, [Jos
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#001.md), [Jos
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#035.md). It appears as if this
Adullamite had kept a kind of lodging house, for Shuah the Canaanite and
his family lodged with him; and there Judah lodged also. As the woman
was a Canaanitess, Judah had the example of his fathers to prove at
least the impropriety of such a connection.

[Genesis 38:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 38:5</span></span>

And he was at Chezib when she bare him - This town is supposed to be the
same with Achzib, which fell to the tribe of Judah, [Jos
15:44](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#044.md). "The name," says Ainsworth,
"has in Hebrew the signification of lying; and to it the prophet
alludes, saying the houses of Achzib shall be (Achzab) a lie to the
kings of Israel, [Mic 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#014.md)."

[Genesis 38:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 38:7</span></span>

Er - was wicked in the sight of the Lord - What this wickedness
consisted in we are not told; but the phrase sight of the Lord being
added, proves that it was some very great evil. It is worthy of remark
that the Hebrew word used to express Er's wickedness is his own name,
the letters reversed. Er ער wicked, רע ra. As if the inspired writer had
said, "Er was altogether wicked, a completely abandoned character."

[Genesis 38:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 38:9</span></span>

Onan knew that the seed should not be his - That is, that the child
begotten of his brother's widow should be reckoned as the child of his
deceased brother, and his name, though the real father of it, should not
appear in the genealogical tables.

[Genesis 38:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 38:10</span></span>

Wherefore he slew him also - The sin of Onan has generally been supposed
to be self-pollution; but this is certainly a mistake; his crime was his
refusal to raise up seed to his brother, and rather than do it, by the
act mentioned above, he rendered himself incapable of it. We find from
this history that long be fore the Mosaic law it was an established
custom, probably founded on a Divine precept, that if a man died
childless his brother was to take his wife, and the children produced by
this second marriage were considered as the children of the first
husband, and in consequence inherited his possessions.

[Genesis 38:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 38:12</span></span>

In process of time - This phrase, which is in general use in the Bible,
needs explanation; the original is וירבו הימים vaiyirbu haiyamim, and
the days were multiplied. Though it implies an indefinite time, yet it
generally embraces a pretty long period, and in this place may mean
several years.

[Genesis 38:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 38:15</span></span>

Thought her to be a harlot - See the original of this term, [Gen
34:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#031) (note.md). The Hebrew is זונה
zonah, and signifies generally a person who prostitutes herself to the
public for hire, or one who lives by the public; and hence very likely
applied to a publican, a tavern-keeper, or hostess, [Jos
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#001.md); translated by the Septuagint, and
in the New Testament, πορνη, from περναω, to sell, which certainly may
as well apply to her goods as to her person.

It appears that in very ancient times there were public persons of this
description; and they generally veiled themselves, sat in public places
by the highway side, and received certain hire. Though adultery was
reputed a very flagrant crime, yet this public prostitution was not; for
persons whose characters were on the whole morally good had connections
with them. But what could be expected from an age in which there was no
written Divine revelation, and consequently the bounds of right and
wrong were not sufficiently ascertained? This defect was supplied in a
considerable measure by the law and the prophets, and now completely by
the Gospel of Christ.

[Genesis 38:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 38:17</span></span>

Wilt thou give me a pledge till thou send it? - The word ערבון erabon
signifies an earnest of something promised, a part of the price agreed
for between a buyer and seller, by giving and receiving of which the
bargain was ratified; or a deposit, which was to be restored when the
thing promised should be given. St. Paul uses the same word in Greek
letters, αρῥαβων, [Co2 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#022.md); [Eph
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#014.md). From the use of the term in this
history we may at once see what the apostle means by the Holy Spirit
being the Earnest, αρῥαβων, of the promised inheritance; viz., a
security given in hand for the fulfillment of all God's promises
relative to grace and eternal life. We may learn from this that eternal
life will be given in the great day to all who can produce this erabon
or pledge. He who has the earnest of the Spirit then in his heart shall
not only be saved from death, but have that eternal life of which it is
the pledge and the evidence. What the pledge given by Judah was, see on
[Gen 38:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#025) (note.md).

[Genesis 38:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 38:21</span></span>

Where is the harlot that was openly by the wayside? - Our translators
often render different Hebrew words by the same term in English, and
thus many important shades of meaning, which involve traits of
character, are lost. In [Gen 38:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#015.md),
Tamar is called a harlot, זונה zonah, which, as we have already seen,
signifies a person who prostitutes herself for money. In this verse she
is called a harlot in our version; but the original is not זונה but קדשה
kedeshah, a holy or consecrated person, from קדש kadash, to make holy,
or to consecrate to religious purposes. And the word here must
necessarily signify a person consecrated by prostitution to the worship
of some impure goddess.

The public prostitutes in the temple of Venus are called ἱεροδουλοι
γυναικες, holy or consecrated female servants, by Strabo; and it appears
from the words zonah and kedeshah above, that impure rites and public
prostitution prevailed in the worship of the Canaanites in the time of
Judah. And among these people we have much reason to believe that
Astarte and Asteroth occupied the same place in their theology as Venus
did among the Greeks and Romans, and were worshipped with the same
impure rites.

[Genesis 38:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">gen 38:23</span></span>

Lest we be shamed - Not of the act, for this he does not appear to have
thought criminal; but lest he should fall under the raillery of his
companions and neighbors, for having been tricked out of his signet,
bracelets, and staff, by a prostitute.

[Genesis 38:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gen 38:24</span></span>

Bring her forth, and let her be burnt - As he had ordered Tamar to live
as a widow in her own father's house till his son Shelah should be
marriageable, he considers her therefore as the wife of his son; and as
Shelah was not yet given to her, and she is found with child, she is
reputed by him as an adulteress, and burning, it seems, was anciently
the punishment of this crime. Judah, being a patriarch or head of a
family, had, according to the custom of those times, the supreme
magisterial authority over all the branches of his own family; therefore
he only acts here in his juridical capacity. How strange that in the
very place where adultery was punished by the most violent death,
prostitution for money and for religious purposes should be considered
as no crime!

[Genesis 38:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">gen 38:25</span></span>

The signet - חתמת chothemeth, properly a seal, or instrument with which
impressions were made to ascertain property, etc. These exist in all
countries.

Bracelets - פתילים pethilim, from פתל pathal, to twist, wreathe, twine,
may signify a girdle or a collar by which precedency, etc., might be
indicated; not the muslin, silk, or linen wreath of his turban, as Mr.
Harmer has conjectured.

Staff - מטה matteh, either what we would call a common walking stick, or
the staff which was the ensign of his tribe.

[Genesis 38:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gen 38:26</span></span>

She hath been more righteous than I - It is probable that Tamar was
influenced by no other motive than that which was common to all the
Israelitish women, the desire to have children who might be heirs of the
promise made to Abraham, etc. And as Judah had obliged her to continue
in her widowhood under the promise of giving her his son Shelah when he
should be of age, consequently his refusing or delaying to accomplish
this promise was a breach of truth, and an injury done to Tamar.

[Genesis 38:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">gen 38:28</span></span>

The midwife - bound upon his hand a scarlet thread - The binding of the
scarlet thread about the wrist of the child whose arm appeared first in
the birth, serves to show us how solicitously the privileges of the
birthright were preserved. Had not this caution been taken by the
midwife, Pharez would have had the right of primogeniture to the
prejudice of his elder brother Zarah. And yet Pharez is usually reckoned
in the genealogical tables before Zarah; and from him, not Zarah, does
the line of our Lord proceed. See [Mat
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#003.md). Probably the two brothers, as
being twins, were conjoined in the privileges belonging to the
birthright.

[Genesis 38:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 38:29</span></span>

How hast thou broken forth? - מה פרצת mah paratsta, this breach be upon
thee, עליך פרץ aleycka parets; thou shalt bear the name of the breach
thou hast made, i. e., in coming first into the world. Therefore his
name was called פרץ Parets, i. e., the person who made the breach. The
breach here mentioned refers to a certain circumstance in parturition
which it is unnecessary to explain.

[Genesis 38:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">gen 38:30</span></span>

His name was called Zarah - זרה Zarach, risen or sprung up, applied to
the sun, rising and diffusing his light. "He had this name," says
Ainsworth, "because he should have risen, i. e., have been born first,
but for the breach which his brother made."

There are several subjects in this chapter on which it may not be
unprofitable to spend a few additional moments.

1\. The insertion of this chapter is a farther proof of the impartiality
of the sacred writer. The facts detailed, considered in themselves, can
reflect no credit on the patriarchal history; but Judah, Tamar, Zarah,
and Pharez, were progenitors of the Messiah, and therefore their birth
must be recorded; and as the birth, so also the circumstances of that
birth, which, even had they not a higher end in view, would be valuable
as casting light upon some very ancient customs, which it is interesting
to understand. These are not forgotten in the preceding notes.

2\. On what is generally reputed to be the sin of Onan, something very
pointed should be spoken. But who dares and will do it, and in such
language that it may neither pollute the ear by describing the evil as
it is, nor fail of its effect by a language so refined and so
laboriously delicate as to cover the sin which it professes to disclose?
Elaborate treatises on the subject will never be read by those who need
them most, and anonymous pamphlets are not likely to be regarded. The
sin of self-pollution, which is generally considered to be that of Onan,
is one of the most destructive evils ever practiced by fallen man. In
many respects it is several degrees worse than common whoredom, and has
in its train more awful consequences, though practiced by numbers who
would shudder at the thought of criminal connections with a prostitute.
It excites the powers of nature to undue action, and produces violent
secretions, which necessarily and speedily exhaust the vital principle
and energy; hence the muscles become flaccid and feeble, the tone and
natural action of the nerves relaxed and impeded, the understanding
confused, the memory oblivious, the judgment perverted, the will
indeterminate and wholly without energy to resist; the eyes appear
languishing and without expression, and the countenance vacant; the
appetite ceases, for the stomach is incapable of performing its proper
office; nutrition fails, tremors, fears, and terrors are generated; and
thus the wretched victim drags out a most miserable existence, till,
superannuated even before he had time to arrive at man's estate, with a
mind often debilitated even to a state of idiotism, his worthless body
tumbles into the grave, and his guilty soul (guilty of self-murder) is
hurried into the awful presence of its Judge! Reader, this is no
caricature, nor are the colourings overcharged in this shocking picture.
Worse woes than my pen can relate I have witnessed in those addicted to
this fascinating, unnatural, and most destructive of crimes. If thou
hast entered into this snare, flee from the destruction both of body and
soul that awaits thee! God alone can save thee. Advice, warnings,
threatenings, increasing debility of body, mental decay, checks of
conscience, expostulations of judgment and medical assistance, will all
be lost on thee: God, and God alone, can save them from an evil which
has in its issue the destruction of thy body, and the final perdition of
thy soul! Whether this may have been the sin of Onan or not, is a matter
at present of small moment; it may be thy sin; therefore take heed lest
God slay thee for it. The intelligent reader will see that prudence
forbids me to enter any farther into this business. See Clarke's note at
[Gen 39:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#021.md).
