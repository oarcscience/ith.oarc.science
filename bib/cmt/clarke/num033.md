### [Numbers Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 33:0</span></span>

The journeyings of the Israelites written out by Moses, according to the
commandment of the Lord, [Num 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#001.md),
[Num 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#002.md). They depart from Rameses on
the fifteenth day of the first month, on the day after the passover, the
first-born of the Egyptians having been slain, [Num
33:3](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#003.md), [Num
33:4](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#004.md). Their forty-two stations
enumerated, vv. 5-49. They are authorized to expel all the former
inhabitants, and destroy all remnants of idolatry, [Num
33:50-53](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#050.md). The land is to be divided by
lot, [Num 33:54](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#054.md). Should they not drive
out the former inhabitants, they shall be to them as pricks in their
eyes and thorns in their sides, [Num
33:55](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#055.md). And if not obedient, God will
deal with them as he has purposed to do with the Canaanites, [Num
33:56](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#056.md).

[Numbers 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 33:2</span></span>

And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys - We may
consider the whole book of Numbers as a diary, and indeed the first book
of travels ever published. Dr. Shaw, Dr. Pococke, and several others,
have endeavored to mark out the route of the Israelites, through this
great, dreary, and trackless desert, and have ascertained many of the
stages here described. Indeed there are sufficient evidences of this
important journey still remaining, for the descriptions of many are so
particular that the places are readily ascertained by them; but this is
not the case with all. Israel was the Church of God in the wilderness,
and its unsettled, wandering state under Moses may point out the
unsettled state of religion under the law. Their being brought, after
the death of Moses, into the promised rest by Joshua, may point out the
establishment, fixedness, and certainty of that salvation provided by
Jesus Christ, of whom Joshua, in name and conduct, was a remarkable
type. Mr. Ainsworth imagines that the forty-two stations here
enumerated, through which the Israelites were brought to the verge of
the promised land, and afterwards taken over Jordan into the rest which
God had promised, point out the forty-two generations from Abraham unto
Christ, through whom the Savior of the world came, by whose blood we
have an entrance into the holiest, and enjoy the inheritance among the
saints in light. And Mr. Bromley, in his Way to the Sabbath of Rest,
considers each name and place as descriptive of the spiritual state
through which a soul passes in its way to the kingdom of God. But in
cases of this kind fancy has much more to do than judgment.

[Numbers 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 33:3</span></span>

From Rameses - This appears to have been the metropolis of the land of
Goshen, and the place of rendezvous whence the whole Israelitish nation
set out on their journey to the promised land; and is supposed to be the
same as Cairo. See the notes on [Exo
12:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#037.md).

Here Follow the Forty-Two Stations

Station 1.

[Numbers 33:5](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 33:5</span></span>

And pitched in Succoth - This name signifies booths or tents, and
probably refers to no town or village, but simply designates the place
where they pitched their tents for the first time after their departure
from Rameses.

Stat. 2.

[Numbers 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 33:6</span></span>

Etham, which is in the edge of the wilderness - This place is not well
known; Dr. Shaw supposes it to have been one mile from Cairo. Calmet
thinks it is the city of Buthum mentioned by Herodotus, which he places
in Arabia, on the frontiers of Egypt.

Stat. 3.

[Numbers 33:7](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 33:7</span></span>

Pi-hahiroth - See on [Exo 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#001) (note.md),
and [Exo 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#002) (note.md). Baal-zephon
Calmet supposes to be the Clysma of the Greeks, and the Kolzum of the
Arabians.

Stat. 4.

[Numbers 33:8](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 33:8</span></span>

And went three days' journey in the wilderness of Etham - Called the
wilderness of Shur, [Exo 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#022.md).

And pitched in Marah - Dr. Shaw supposes this place to be at Sedur, over
against the valley of Baideah, on the opposite side of the Red Sea.

Stat. 5.

[Numbers 33:9](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 33:9</span></span>

And came unto Elim - A place on the skirts of the deserts of Sin, two
leagues from Tor, and nearly thirty from Corondel, a large bay on the
east side of the Red Sea. Dr. Shaw, when he visited this place, found
but nine of the twelve wells mentioned in the text, and instead of 70
palm trees, he found upwards of 2,000. See on [Exo
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#027) (note.md).

Stat. 6.

[Numbers 33:10](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 33:10</span></span>

Encamped by the Red Sea - It is difficult to assign the place of this
encampment, as the Israelites were now on their way to Mount Sinai,
which lay considerably to the east of Elim, and consequently farther
from the sea than the former station. It might be called by the Red Sea,
as the Israelites had it, as the principal object, still in view. This
station however is mentioned nowhere else. By the Red Sea we are not to
understand a sea, the waters of which are red, or the sand red, or any
thing else about or in it red; for nothing of this kind appears. It is
called in Hebrew ים סוף yam suph, which signifies the weedy sea. The
Septuagint rendered the original by θαλασσα εραθρα, and the Vulgate
after it by mare rubrum, and the European versions followed these, and,
in opposition to etymology and reason, translated it the Red Sea. See
the note on [Exo 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#019.md).

Stat. 7.

[Numbers 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 33:11</span></span>

The wilderness of Sin - This lies between Elim and Mount Sinai. Dr. Shaw
and his companions traversed these plains in nine hours.

Stat. 8.

[Numbers 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 33:12</span></span>

Dophkah - This place is not mentioned in Exodus and its situation is not
known.

Stat. 9.

[Numbers 33:13](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 33:13</span></span>

Alush - Neither is this mentioned in Exodus and its situation is equally
unknown.

Stat. 10.

[Numbers 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">num 33:14</span></span>

Rephidim - Remarkable for the rebellion of the Israelites against Moses,
because of the want of water, Exodus 17.

Stat. 11.

[Numbers 33:15](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">num 33:15</span></span>

The wilderness of Sinai - Somewhere northward of Mount Sinai, on the
straight road to the promised land, to which they now directed their
course.

Stat. 12.

[Numbers 33:16](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 33:16</span></span>

Kibroth-hattaavah - No city, village, etc., but a place in the open
desert, which had its name from the plague that fell upon the
Israelites, through their murmuring against God, and their inordinate
desire of flesh. See on Numbers 11 (note). But it appears that the
Israelites had traveled three days' journey in order to reach this
place, [Num 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#033.md), and commentators
suppose there must have been other stations which are not laid down
here, probably because the places were not remarkable.

Stat. 13.

[Numbers 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">num 33:17</span></span>

Hazeroth - This place Dr. Shaw computes to have been about thirty miles
distant from Mount Sinai.

Stat. 14.

[Numbers 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">num 33:18</span></span>

Rithmah - This place lay somewhere in the wilderness of Paran, through
which the Israelites were now passing. See [Num
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#001.md), [Num
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#003.md). The name signifies the juniper
tree; and the place probably had its name from the great number of those
trees growing in that district.

Stat. 15.

[Numbers 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">num 33:19</span></span>

Rimmon-parez - Unknown.

Stat. 16.

[Numbers 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 33:20</span></span>

Libnah - The situation of this place is uncertain. A city of this name
is mentioned [Jos 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#029.md), as situated
between Kadesh-barnea and Gaza.

Stat. 17.

[Numbers 33:21](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 33:21</span></span>

Bissah - A place mentioned nowhere else in the sacred writings. Its
situation utterly uncertain.

Stat. 18.

[Numbers 33:22](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">num 33:22</span></span>

Kehelathah - Utterly unknown; though some conjecture that it might have
been the place called Keilah, [Sa1
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#001.md), etc., but this is unlikely.

Stat. 19.

[Numbers 33:23](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">num 33:23</span></span>

Shapher - Where this mountain lay cannot be determined.

Stat. 20.

[Numbers 33:24](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">num 33:24</span></span>

Haradah - Unknown, Calmet supposes that it may be the place called
Bered, [Gen 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#014.md), which was in the
vicinity of Kadesh.

Stat. 21.

[Numbers 33:25](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">num 33:25</span></span>

Makheloth - A name found nowhere else in Scripture.

Stat. 22.

[Numbers 33:26](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">num 33:26</span></span>

[Numbers 33:27](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">num 33:27</span></span>

Tarah - Also unknown.

Stat. 24.

[Numbers 33:28](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">num 33:28</span></span>

Mithcah - Calmet conjectures that this may be Mocha, a city in Arabia
Petraea.

Stat. 25.

[Numbers 33:29](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">num 33:29</span></span>

Hashmonah - Supposed by some to be the same as Azmon, [Num
34:4](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#004.md).

Stat. 26.

[Numbers 33:30](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">num 33:30</span></span>

Moseroth - Situation unknown. In [Deu
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#006.md) it is said that the Israelites
took their journey from Beeroth, the wells of the children of Jaakan, to
Mosera, and there Aaron died. If so, Mosera, Moseroth, and Hor, must be
different names of the same place; or Moseroth, or Mosera, must have
been some town or village near Mount Hor, for there Aaron died. See [Num
33:38](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#038.md).

Stat. 27.

[Numbers 33:31](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">num 33:31</span></span>

Bene-jaakan - Unknown. The sons of Jaakan. See the preceding verse, [Num
33:30](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#030) (note.md).

Stat. 28.

[Numbers 33:32](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">num 33:32</span></span>

Hor-hagidgad - The hole or pit of Gidgad. Unknown. It was a place
perhaps remarkable for some vast pit or cavern, from which it took its
name.

Stat. 29.

[Numbers 33:33](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">num 33:33</span></span>

Jotrathah - Situation unknown. It is said in [Deu
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#007.md) to be a land of rivers of waters.

Stat. 30.

[Numbers 33:34](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">num 33:34</span></span>

Ebronah - Nowhere else mentioned. Stat. 31.

[Numbers 33:35](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">num 33:35</span></span>

Ezion-gaber - Dr. Shaw places this port on the western coast of the
Elantic gulf of the Red Sea. It is now called Meenah el Dsahab, or the
golden port, by the Arabs; because it was from this place that Solomon
sent his ships for gold to Ophir, [Kg1
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#026.md). He supposes it to be about sixty
miles distant from Mount Sinai - Travels, p. 322, 4th. edition.

Stat. 32.

[Numbers 33:36](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">num 33:36</span></span>

Zin, which is Kadesh - A place remarkable for the death of Miriam the
prophetess, and bringing water out of the rock. As this place was on the
borders of Edom, the Israelites, being denied permission to pass through
their land, which lay on the direct road to the promised land, were
obliged to turn to the right to Mount Hor, now called Accaba by the
Arabs.

Stat. 33.

[Numbers 33:37](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">num 33:37</span></span>

Hor - Famous for the death of Aaron. See on Numbers 20 (note). Perhaps
Moseroth or Mosera, [Num 33:30](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#030) (note.md),
was a village near this mountain.

Stat. 34.

[Numbers 33:41](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">num 33:41</span></span>

Zalmonah - Probably in the neighborhood of the land of Edom. As צלם
tselem signifies an image, this place probably had its name from the
brazen serpent set up by Moses. See [Num
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#009) (note.md), etc. From the same root
the word telesm, corruptly called talisman, which signifies a
consecrated image, is derived.

Stat. 35.

[Numbers 33:42](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">num 33:42</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">num 33:44</span></span>

Ije-abarim - The heaps of Abarim. See [Num
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#011.md). Situation uncertain. It is
called Iim in the following verse. As the word signifies heaps or
protuberances, it probably means tumuil or small hills near some of the
fords of Jordan.

Stat. 38.

[Numbers 33:45](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">num 33:45</span></span>

Dibon-gad - Supposed to be the same as Dibon, [Num
32:34](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#034.md), and to be situated on the brook
Arnon.

Stat. 39.

[Numbers 33:46](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">num 33:46</span></span>

Almon-diblathaim - Situation not known. It belonged to the Moabites in
the time of the prophet Jeremiah. [Jer
48:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#022.md).

Stat. 40.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">num 33:47</span></span>

Mountains of Abarim, before Nebo - The mountain on which Moses died.
They came to this place after the overthrow of the Amorites. See Numbers
21.

Stat. 41.

[Numbers 33:48](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">num 33:48</span></span>

The Plains of Moab - This was the scene of the transactions between
Balaam and Balak; see Numbers 23, 24, 25.

Stat. 42.

[Numbers 33:49](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">num 33:49</span></span>

From Beth-jesimoth even unto Abel-shittim - The former of these places
fell to the Reubenites, [Jos 13:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#015.md).
The Israelites were now come to the edge of Jordan, over against
Jericho, where they afterwards passed.

For further information on the subject of these different encampments,
the reader is requested to refer to the extracts from Dr. Shaw at the
end of the book of Exodus.

[Numbers 33:52](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">num 33:52</span></span>

Ye shall - destroy all their pictures - משכיתם maskiyotham, from שחה
sachah, to be like, or resemble, either pictures, carved work, or
embroidery, as far as these things were employed to exhibit the
abominations of idolatry. Molten images צלמי מסכתם tsalmey massechotham,
metallic talismanical figures, made under certain constellations, and
supposed in consequence to be possessed of some extraordinary influences
and virtues.

[Numbers 33:55](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#055.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">num 33:55</span></span>

Shall be pricks in your eyes - Under these metaphors, the continual
mischief that should be done to them, both in soul and body, by these
idolaters, is set forth in a very expressive manner. What can be more
vexatious than a continual goading of each side, so that the attempt to
avoid the one throws the body more forcibly on the other? And what can
be more distressing than a continual pricking in the eye, harassing the
mind, tormenting the body, and extinguishing the sight?

1\. It has been usual among pious men to consider these Canaanites
remaining in the land, as emblems of indwelling sin; and it must be
granted that what those remaining Canaanites were to the people of
Israel, who were disobedient to God, such is indwelling sin to all those
who will not have the blood of the covenant to cleanse them from all
unrighteousness. For a time, while conscience is tender, such persons
feel themselves straitened in all their goings, hindered in all their
religious services, and distressed beyond measure because of the law -
the authority and power of sin, which they find warring in their
members: by and by the eye of their mind becomes obscured by the
constant piercings of sin, till at last, fatally persuaded that sin must
dwell in them as long as they live, they accommodate their minds to
their situation, their consciences cease to be tender, and they content
themselves with expecting redemption where and when it has never been
promised, viz., beyond the grave! On the subject of the journeyings of
the Israelites, the following observations from old Mr. Ainsworth cannot
fail to interest the reader.

2\. "The Travels of Israel through that great and terrible wilderness,
wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there was
no water, [Deu 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#015.md), which was a land
of deserts, and of pits, a land of drought, and of the shadow of death,
a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt, [Jer
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#006.md), signified the many troubles and
afflictions through which we must enter into the kingdom of God, [Act
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#022.md). The helps, comforts, and
deliverances which God gave unto his people in their distresses, are
examples of his love and mercy towards his followers; for he comforts
them in all their tribulation, that as the sufferings of Christ abound
in them, so their consolation also abounds in Christ, [Co2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#005.md). The punishments which God
inflicted upon the disobedient, who perished in the wilderness for their
sins, happened unto them for ensamples, and they are written for our
admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come, [Co1
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#001.md), [Co1
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#011.md); [Heb
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#017.md), [Heb
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#018.md), [Heb
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#019.md); [Heb
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#001.md), [Heb
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#002.md). By the names of their encamping
places, and histories adjoined, it appears how Israel came sometimes
into straits and troublesome ways, as at Pihahiroth, [Exo
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#002.md), [Exo
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#003.md), [Exo
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#010.md), etc.; and at Zalmonah, [Num
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#001.md), [Num
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#004.md), etc.; sometimes into large and
ample room, as at the plains of Moab; sometimes to places of hunger and
thirst, as at Rephidim and Kadesh, Exodus 16, 17; Numbers 20; sometimes
to places of refreshing, as at Elim and Beer, [Exo
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#027.md); [Num
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#016.md); sometimes where they had wars,
as at Rephidim, Kadesh, Edrei, [Exo
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#008.md); [Num
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#001.md), [Num
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#033.md); sometimes where they had rest,
as at Mount Sinai: sometimes they went right forward, as from Sinai to
Kadesh-barnea; sometimes they turned backward, as from Kadesh-barnea to
the Red Sea: sometimes they came to mountains, as Sinai, Shapher,
Hor-Gidgad; sometimes to valleys, as Tahath, etc.; sometimes to places
of bitterness, as Marah; sometimes, of sweetness, as Mithcah.

3\. "The Sins which they committed in the wilderness were many and
great; as open Idolatry by the calf, at Horeb, Exodus 32, and with
Baal-peor, Numbers 25. Unbelief, at Kadesh, Numbers 14; and afterwards
Presumptuous Boldness in the same place; Murmuring against God sundry
times, with tempting of Christ, (as the apostle speaks, 1 Corinthians
15). Contention and Rebellion against their governors often; lusting for
flesh to fill their appetites, and loathing manna, the heavenly food;
Whoredom with the daughters of Moab, and many other provocations; so
that this complaint is after made of them, How oft did they provoke him
in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert! [Psa
78:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#040.md). All sorts of persons sinned
against God; the multitude of people very often; the mixed multitude of
strangers among them, Numbers 11. The princes, as the ten spies, Dathan,
Abiram, etc. The Levites, as Korah and his company; Miriam the
prophetess, Numbers 12; Aaron the priest with her, besides his sin at
Horeb, Exodus 32; and at the water of Meribah, Numbers 20. Moses also
himself at the same place, for which he was excluded from the land of
Canaan.

4\. "The Punishments laid on them by the Lord for their disobedience
were many. They died by the sword of the enemy, as of the Amalekites,
Exodus 17, and of the Canaanites, [Num
14:45](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#045.md); and some by the sword of their
brethren, Exodus 32. Some were burned with fire, Numbers 11, 16; some
died with surfeit, Numbers 11; some were swallowed up alive in the
earth, Numbers 16; some were killed with serpents, Numbers 21; many died
of the pestilence, [Num 16:46](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#046.md), and
[Num 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#025.md); and generally all that
generation which were first mustered, after their coming out of Egypt,
perished, [Num 26:64](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#064.md), [Num
26:65](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#065.md). God consumed their days in
vanity, and their years in terror, [Psa
78:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#033.md).

5\. "Nevertheless, for his name's sake, he magnified his Mercies unto
them and their posterity. He had divided the sea, and led them through
on dry land, drowning their enemies, Exodus 14. He led them with a cloud
by day, and a pillar of fire by night, continually. He gave them manna
from heaven daily. He clave the rock, and gave them water for their
thirst. He fed them with quails, when they longed for flesh. He
sweetened the bitter waters. He saved them from the sword of their
enemies. He delivered them from the fiery serpents and scorpions. Their
raiment waxed not old upon them, neither did their foot swell for forty
years, [Deu 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#004.md). He delivered them
from the intended curse of Balaam, and turned it into a blessing,
because he loved them, Numbers 22; [Deu
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#005.md). He came down from Mount Sinai,
and spake with them from heaven, and gave them right judgments and true
laws, good statutes and commandments, and gave also his good Spirit to
instruct them, [Neh 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#013.md), [Neh
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#020.md). In the times of his wrath he
remembered mercy; his eye spared them from destroying them, neither did
he make an end of them in the wilderness, [Eze
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#017.md), [Eze
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#022.md). He gave them kingdoms and
nations, and they possessed the lands of their enemies; and he
multiplied their children as the stars of heaven, and brought them into
the land promised unto their forefathers. [Neh
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#022.md), [Neh
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#023.md). Now whatsoever things were
written aforetime were written for our learning, that we, through
patience and comfort of the Scriptures, might have hope, [Rom
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#004.md)." Let him that readeth
understand."
