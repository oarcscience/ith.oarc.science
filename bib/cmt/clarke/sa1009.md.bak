### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 9:0</span></span>

Saul's lineage and description; he is sent by his father to seek some
lost asses, [Sa1 9:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#001.md). Not finding
them, he purposes to go and consult Samuel concerning the proper method
of proceeding, [Sa1 9:6-14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#006.md). The Lord
informs Samuel that he should anoint Saul king, [Sa1
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#015.md), [Sa1
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#016.md). Samuel invites Saul to dine with
him, and informs him that the asses are found; and gives him an
intimation that he is to be king, [Sa1
9:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#017.md). Saul dines with Samuel, and
afterwards he is taken to the house-top, where both commune together,
[Sa1 9:22-27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#022.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 9:1</span></span>

A mighty man of power - Literally, a strong man; this appears to be the
only power he possessed; and the physical strength of the father may
account for the extraordinary size of the son. See [Sa1
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#002.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 9:2</span></span>

From his shoulders and upwards - It was probably from this very
circumstance that he was chosen for king; for, where kings were
elective, in all ancient times great respect was paid to personal
appearance.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 9:3</span></span>

The asses of Kish - were lost - What a wonderful train of occurrences
were connected in order to bring Saul to the throne of Israel! Every
thing seems to go on according to the common course of events, and yet
all conspired to favor the election of a man to the kingdom who
certainly did not come there by the approbation of God.

Asses grow to great perfection in the East; and at this time, as there
were no horses in Judea, they were very useful; and on them kings and
princes rode.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 9:5</span></span>

Were come to the land of Zuph - Calmet supposes that Saul and his
servant went from Gibeah to Shalisha, in the tribe of Dan; from thence
to Shalim, near to Jerusalem; and thence, traversing the tribe of
Benjamin, they purposed to return to Gibeah; but passing through the
land of Zuph, in which Ramatha, the country of Samuel, was situated,
they determined to call on this prophet to gain some directions from
him; the whole of this circuit he supposes to have amounted to no more
than about twenty-five leagues, or three days' journey. We do not know
where the places were situated which are here mentioned: the Targum
translates thus: "And he passed through the mount of the house of
Ephraim, and went into the southern land, but did not meet with them.
And he passed through the land of Mathbera, but they were not there; and
he passed through the land of the tribe of Benjamin, but did not find
them; then they came into the land where the prophet of the Lord dwelt.
And Saul said to his servant," etc.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 9:7</span></span>

There is not a present to bring to the man of God - We are not to
suppose from this that the prophets took money to predict future events:
Saul only refers to an invariable custom, that no man approached a
superior without a present of some kind or other. We have often seen
this before; even God, who needs nothing, would not that his people
should approach him with empty hands. "It is very common in Bengal for a
person, who is desirous of asking a favor from a superior, to take a
present of fruits or sweetmeats in his hand. If not accepted, the
feelings of the offerer are greatly wounded. The making of presents to
appease a superior is also very common in Bengal." - Ward's Customs.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 9:8</span></span>

The fourth part of a shekel of silver - We find from the preceding
verse, that the bread or provisions which they had brought with them for
their journey was expended, else a part of that would have been thought
a suitable present; and here the fourth part of a shekel of silver,
about ninepence of our money, was deemed sufficient: therefore the
present was intended more as a token of respect than as an emolument.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 9:9</span></span>

Beforetime in Israel - This passage could not have been a part of this
book originally: but we have already conjectured that Samuel, or some
contemporary author, wrote the memoranda, out of which a later author
compiled this book. This hypothesis, sufficiently reasonable in itself,
solves all difficulties of this kind.

Was beforetime called a seer - The word seer, ראה roeh, occurs for the
first time in this place; it literally signifies a person who Sees;
particularly preternatural sights. A seer and a prophet were the same in
most cases; only with this difference, the seer was always a prophet,
but the prophet was not always a seer. A seer seems to imply one who
frequently met with, and saw, some symbolical representation of God. The
term prophet was used a long time before this; Abraham is called a
prophet, [Gen 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#007.md), and the term
frequently occurs in the law. Besides, the word seer does not occur
before this time; but often occurs afterwards down through the prophets,
for more than three hundred years. See [Amo
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#012.md); [Mic
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#007.md).

All prophets, false and true, profess to see God; see the case of
Balaam, [Num 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#004.md), [Num
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#016.md), and [Jer
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#014.md). All diviners, in their
enthusiastic flights, boasted that they had those things exhibited to
their sight which should come to pass. There is a remarkable account in
Virgil which may serve as a specimen of the whole; the Sibyl professes
to be a seer: -

\- Bella, horrida bella,

Et Tyberim molto spumantem sanguine

Cerno. Aen. lib. vi., ver. 86.

Wars, horrid wars, I View; a field of blood;

And Tyber rolling with a purple flood.

I think the 9th verse comes more naturally in after the 11th.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 9:11</span></span>

Young maidens going out to draw water - So far is it from being true,
that young women were always kept closely shut up at home, that we find
them often in the field, drawing and carrying water, as here.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 9:12</span></span>

He came to - day to the city - Though Samuel lived chiefly in Ramah, yet
he had a dwelling in the country, at a place called Naioth, where it is
probable there was a school of the prophets. See [Sa1
19:18-24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#018.md).

A sacrifice of the people - A great feast. The animals used were first
sacrificed to the Lord; that is, their blood was poured out before him;
and then all the people fed on the flesh. By high place probably
Samuel's altar is alone meant; which no doubt was raised on an eminence.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 9:13</span></span>

He doth bless the sacrifice - He alone can perform the religious rites
which are used on this occasion.

Afterwards they eat that be bidden - Among the Arabs, often a large
feast is made of sacrificed camels, etc., and then the people of the
vicinity are invited to come and partake of the sacrifice. This is the
custom to which allusion is made here.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 9:14</span></span>

Come out against them - Met them.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 9:15</span></span>

Now the Lord had told Samuel - How this communication was made, we
cannot tell.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa1 9:16</span></span>

Thou shalt anoint him to be captain - Not to be king, but to be נגיד
nagid or captain of the Lord's host. But in ancient times no king was
esteemed who was not an able warrior. Plutarch informs us that Alexander
the Great esteemed the following verse the most correct, as to its
sentiment, of any in the whole Iliad of Homer: -

Ουτος γ' Ατρειδης ευρυκρειων Αγαμεμνων,

Αμφοτερον βασιλευς τ' αγαθος, κρατερος τ' αιχμητης.

"The king of kings, Atrides, you survey;

Great in the war, and great in acts of sway."

Pope.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa1 9:17</span></span>

Behold the man whom I spake to thee of - What an intimate communion must
Samuel have held with his God! A constant familiarity seems to have
existed between them.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 9:19</span></span>

I am the seer - This declaration would prepare Saul for the
communications afterwards made.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 9:20</span></span>

As for thine asses - Thus he shows him that he knew what was in his
heart, God having previously revealed these things to Samuel.

And on whom is all the desire of Israel? - Saul understood this as
implying that he was chosen to be king.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa1 9:21</span></span>

Am not I a Benjamite - This speech of Saul is exceedingly modest; he was
now becomingly humble; but who can bear elevation and prosperity? The
tribe of Benjamin had not yet recovered its strength, after the ruinous
war it had with the other tribes, Judges 20:29-46.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa1 9:22</span></span>

Brought them into the parlour - It might as well be called kitchen; it
was the place where they sat down to feast.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa1 9:23</span></span>

Said unto the cook - טבח tabbach, here rendered cook; the singular of
טבחות tabbachoth, female cooks, [Sa1
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#013.md), from the root tabach, to slay or
butcher. Probably the butcher is here meant.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa1 9:24</span></span>

The shoulder, and that which was upon it - Probably the shoulder was
covered with a part of the caul, that it might be the better roasted.
The Targum has it the shoulder and its thigh; not only the shoulder
merely, but the fore-leg bone to the knee; perhaps the whole
fore-quarter. Why was the shoulder set before Saul? Not because it was
the best part, but because it was an emblem of the government to which
he was now called. See [Isa 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md) : And
the government shall be upon his Shoulder.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa1 9:25</span></span>

Upon the top of the house - All the houses in the East were flat-roofed;
on these people walked, talked, and frequently slept, for the sake of
fresh and cooling air.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa1 9:26</span></span>

Called Saul to the top of the house - Saul had no doubt slept there all
night; and now, it being the break of day, "Samuel called to Saul on the
top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away." There was no
calling him to the house-top a second time he was sleeping there, and
Samuel called him up.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa1 9:27</span></span>

As they were going down - So it appears that Saul arose immediately, and
Samuel accompanied him out of the town, and sent the servant on that he
might show Saul the word, the counsel or design, of the Lord. What this
was we shall see in the following chapter, 1 Samuel 10 (note).
