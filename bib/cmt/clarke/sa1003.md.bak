### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 3:0</span></span>

Samuel ministers to the Lord before Eli, [Sa1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#001.md). He is thrice called by the Lord;
who informs him of the evils which shall be brought on the house of Eli,
[Sa1 3:2-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#002.md). Eli inquires of Samuel
what the Lord had said, [Sa1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#016.md),
[Sa1 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#017.md). He gives a faithful reunion
of the whole, which Eli receives with great submission, [Sa1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#018.md). Samuel prospers; is established
as a prophet in Israel; and the Lord reveals himself to him to Shiloh,
[Sa1 3:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#019.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 3:1</span></span>

Samuel ministered unto the Lord - He performed minor services in the
tabernacle, under the direction of Eli, such as opening the doors, etc.
See [Sa1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#015.md).

The word of the Lord was precious - There were but few revelations from
God; and because the word was scarce, therefore it was valuable. The
author of this book probably lived at a time when prophecy was frequent,
See the preface.

There was no open vision - There was no public accredited prophet; one
with whom the secret of the Lord was known to dwell, and to whom all
might have recourse in cases of doubt or public emergency.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 3:2</span></span>

Eli was laid down in his place - It is very likely that as the ark was a
long time at Shiloh, they had built near to it certain apartments for
the high priest and others more immediately employed about the
tabernacle. In one of these, near to that of Eli, perhaps under the same
roof, Samuel lay when he was called by the Lord.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 3:3</span></span>

Ere the lamp of God went out - Before sunrise; for it is likely that the
lamps were extinguished before the rising of the sun. See [Exo
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#021.md); [Lev
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#003.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 3:4</span></span>

The Lord called Samuel - The voice probably came from the holy place,
near to which Eli and Samuel were both lying.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 3:7</span></span>

Samuel did not yet know the Lord - He had not been accustomed to receive
any revelation from him. He knew and worshipped the God of Israel; but
he did not know him as communicating especial revelation of His will.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 3:9</span></span>

Speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth - This was the usual way in which
the prophets spoke, when they had intimations that the Lord was about to
make some especial revelation.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 3:10</span></span>

The Lord came, and stood - He heard the voice as if it was approaching
nearer and nearer; till at last, from the sameness of the tone, he could
imagine that it ceased to approach: and this is what appears to be
represented under the notion of God standing and calling.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 3:11</span></span>

The Lord said to Samuel - He probably saw nothing, and only heard the
voice; for it was not likely that any extraordinary representation could
have been made to the eyes of a person so young. He heard a voice, but
saw no similitude.

The ears - shall tingle - It shall be a piercing word to all Israel; it
shall astound them all; and, after having heard it, it will still
continue to resound in their ears.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 3:12</span></span>

I will perform - all things which I have spoken - That is, what He had
declared by the prophet, whose message is related [Sa1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#027.md), etc.

When I begin, I will also make an end - I will not delay the execution
of my purpose: when I begin, nothing shall deter me from bringing all my
judgments to a conclusion.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 3:13</span></span>

I will judge his house for ever - I will continue to execute judgments
upon it till it is destroyed.

His sons made themselves vile - See [Sa1
2:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#012.md), [Sa1
2:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#022.md).

He restrained them not - He did not use his parental and juridical
authority to curb them, and prevent the disorders which they committed.
See at the conclusion of the chapter, [Sa1
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#021) (note.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 3:14</span></span>

Shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering - That is, God was
determined that they should be removed by a violent death. They had
committed the sin unto death; and no offering or sacrifice could prevent
this. What is spoken here relates to their temporal death only.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 3:15</span></span>

Samuel feared to show Eli - He reverenced him as a father, and he feared
to distress him by showing what the Lord had purposed to do. It does not
appear that God had commanded Samuel to deliver this message: he,
therefore, did not attempt it till adjured by Eli, [Sa1
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#017.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa1 3:17</span></span>

God do so to thee, and more also - This was a very solemn adjuration: he
suspected that God had threatened severe judgments, for he knew that his
house was very criminal; and he wished to know what God had spoken. The
words imply thus much: If thou do not tell me fully what God has
threatened, may the same and greater curses fall on thyself.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa1 3:18</span></span>

Samuel told him every whit - Our word whit, or wid, comes from the
Anglo-Saxon, which signifies person, thing, etc.; every whit is every
thing. The Hebrew את כל הדברים et col haddebarim, "all these words."

It is the Lord - He is Sovereign, and will do what he pleases; he is
righteous, and will do nothing but what is just.

Let him do what seemeth him good - There is much of a godly submission,
as well as a deep sense of his own unworthiness, found in these words.
He also had sinned, so as to be punished with temporal death; but surely
there is no evidence that the displeasure of the Lord against him was
extended to a future state.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 3:19</span></span>

Samuel grew - Increased to manhood.

The Lord was with him - Teaching him, and filling him with grace and
holiness.

None of his words fall - Whatever prediction he uttered, God fulfilled
it; and his counsels were received as coming from the Lord.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 3:20</span></span>

All Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba - Through the whole extent of
Palestine; Dan being at the northern, Beer-sheba at the southern
extremity.

Was established to be a prophet - The word נאמן neeman, which we
translate established, signifies faithful: The faithful Samuel was a
prophet of the Lord.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa1 3:21</span></span>

The Lord appeared again - וישף יהוה להראה vaiyoseph Yehovah leheraoh,
"And Jehovah added to appear;" that is, he continued to reveal himself
to Samuel at Shiloh.

By the word of the Lord - By the spirit and word of prophecy.

In this chapter we read again of the fearful consequences of a neglected
religious education. Eli's sons were wicked: their father knew the Lord;
but he neither taught his children, nor restrained them by his parental
authority. I have already had occasion to remark, that were a proper
line of conduct pursued in the education of children, how few profligate
sons and daughters, and how few broken-hearted parents should we find!
The neglect of early religious education, connected with a wholesome and
affectionate restraint, is the ruin of millions. Many parents, to excuse
their indolence and most criminal neglect, say, "We cannot give our
children grace." What do they mean by this? That God, not themselves, is
the author of the irregularities and viciousness of their children. They
may shudder at this imputation: but when they reflect that they have not
given them right precepts, have not brought them under firm and
affectionate restraint; have not showed them, by their own spirit,
temper, and conduct, how they should be regulated in theirs; when either
the worship of God has not been established in their houses, or they
have permitted their children, on the most trifling pretenses, to absent
themselves from it; when all these things are considered, they will find
that, speaking after the manner of men, it would have been a very
extraordinary miracle indeed if the children had been found preferring a
path in which they did not see their parents conscientiously tread. Let
those parents who continue to excuse themselves by saying, "We cannot
give grace to our children," lay their hand on their conscience, and say
whether they ever knew an instance where God withheld his grace, while
they were, in humble subserviency to him, performing their duty. The
real state of the case is this: parents cannot do God's work, and God
will not do theirs; but if they use the means, and train up the child in
the way he should go, God will not withhold his blessing.

It is not parental fondness, nor parental authority, taken separately,
that can produce this beneficial effect. A father may be as fond of his
offspring as Eli, and his children be sons of Belial; he may be as
authoritative as the grand Turk, and his children despise and plot
rebellion against him. But let parental authority be tempered with
fatherly affection; and let the rein of discipline be steadily held by
this powerful but affectionate hand; and there shall the pleasure of God
prosper; there will he give his blessing, even life for evermore. Many
fine families have been spoiled, and many ruined, by the separate
exercise of these two principles. Parental affection, when alone,
infallibly degenerates into foolish fondness; and parental authority
frequently degenerates into brutal tyranny when standing by itself. The
first sort of parents will be loved without being respected; the second
sort will be dreaded, without either respect or esteem. In the first
case obedience is not exacted, and is therefore felt to be unnecessary,
as offenses of great magnitude pass without punishment or reprehension:
in the second case, rigid exaction renders obedience almost impossible;
and the smallest delinquency is often punished with the extreme of
torture, which, hardening the mind, renders duty a matter of perfect
indifference.

Parents, lay these things to heart: remember Eli and his sons; remember
the dismal end of both! Teach your children to fear God, use wholesome
discipline, be determined, begin in time, mingle severity and mercy
together in all your conduct, and earnestly pray to God to second your
godly discipline with the power and grace of his Spirit.

Education is generally defined that series of means by which the human
understanding is gradually enlightened, and the dispositions of the
heart are corrected, formed, and brought forth, between early infancy
and the period when a young person is considered as qualified to take a
part in active life. Whole nations have been corrupted, enfeebled, and
destroyed, through the want of proper education: through this multitudes
of families have degenerated; and a countless number of individuals have
come to an untimely end. Parents who neglect this, neglect the present
and eternal interests of their offspring.
