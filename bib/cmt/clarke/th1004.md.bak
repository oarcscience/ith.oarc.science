### [1 Thessalonians Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#001.md)

[1 Thessalonians](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">th1 4:0</span></span>

The apostle exhorts them to attend to the directions which he had
already given them, that they might know how to walk and please God,
[Th1 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#001.md), [Th1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#002.md). Gives them exhortations
concerning continence, chastity, and matrimonial fidelity, [Th1
4:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#003.md). Speaks concerning their love to
each other, and love to the Churches of Christ; and exhorts them to
continue and increase in it, [Th1 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#009.md),
[Th1 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#010.md). Counsels them to observe an
inoffensive conduct, to mind their own affairs, to do their own
business, and to live honestly, [Th1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#011.md), [Th1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#012.md). Not to sorrow for the dead, as
persons who have no hope of a resurrection; because to Christians the
resurrection of Christ is a proof of the resurrection of his followers,
[Th1 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#013.md), [Th1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#014.md). Gives a short but awful
description of the appearing of Christ to judge the world, [Th1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#015.md).

[1 Thessalonians 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">th1 4:1</span></span>

We beseech you, brethren, and exhort - We give you proper instructions
in heavenly things, and request you to attend to our advice. The apostle
used the most pressing entreaties; for he had a strong and affectionate
desire that this Church should excel in all righteousness and true
holiness.

Please God more and more - God sets no bounds to the communications of
his grace and Spirit to them that are faithful. And as there are no
bounds to the graces, so there should be none to the exercise of those
graces. No man can ever feel that he loves God too much, or that he
loves man too much for God's sake.

[1 Thessalonians 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">th1 4:2</span></span>

Ye know what commandments we gave you - This refers to his instructions
while he was among them; and to instructions on particular subjects,
which he does not recapitulate, but only hints at.

[1 Thessalonians 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">th1 4:3</span></span>

This is the will of God, even your sanctification - God has called you
to holiness; he requires that you should be holy; for without holiness
none can see the Lord. This is the general calling, but in it many
particulars are included. Some of these he proceeds to mention; and it
is very likely that these had been points on which he gave them
particular instructions while among them.

That ye should abstain from fornication - The word πορνεια, as we have
seen in other places, includes all sorts of uncleanness; and it was
probably this consideration that induced several MSS., some versions and
fathers, to add here πασης, all. Directions of this kind were peculiarly
necessary among the Greeks, and indeed heathens in general, who were
strongly addicted to such vices.

[1 Thessalonians 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">th1 4:4</span></span>

How to possess his vessel - Let every man use his wife for the purpose
alone for which God created her, and instituted marriage. The word
σκευοςanswers to the Hebrew כלי keli, which, though it signifies vessel
in general, has several other meanings. That the rabbins frequently
express wife by it, Schoettgen largely proves; and to me it appears very
probable that the apostle uses it in that sense here. St. Peter calls
the wife the weaker Vessel, [Pe1 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#007.md).
Others think that the body is meant, which is the vessel in which the
soul dwells. In this sense St. Paul uses it, [Co2
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#007.md) : We have this treasure in earthen
Vessels; and in this sense it is used by both Greek and Roman authors.
There is a third sense which interpreters have put on the word, which I
forbear to name. The general sense is plain; purity and continency are
most obviously intended, whether the word be understood as referring to
the wife or the husband, as the following verse sufficiently proves.

[1 Thessalonians 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">th1 4:5</span></span>

Not in the lust of concupiscence - Having no rational object, aim, nor
end. Some say, "not like beasts;" but this does not apply as they who
use it wish, for the males and females of the brute creation are regular
and consistent in their intercourse, and scarcely ever exceed such
bounds as reason itself would prescribe to those most capable of
observing and obeying its dictates.

The Gentiles which know not God - These are the beasts; their own brutes
are rational creatures when compared with them. Enough has been said on
this subject on Romans 1, and 2: They who wish to see more may consult
Juvenal, and particularly his 6th and 9th Satires; and indeed all the
writers on Greek and Roman morals.

[1 Thessalonians 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">th1 4:6</span></span>

That no man go beyond and defraud his brother - That no man should by
any means endeavor to corrupt the wife of another, or to alienate her
affections or fidelity from her husband; this I believe to be the
apostle's meaning, though some understand it of covetousness,
overreaching, tricking, cheating, and cozenage in general.

The Lord is the avenger of all such - He takes up the cause of the
injured husband wherever the case has not been detected by man, and all
such vices he will signally punish. Every species of uncleanness was
practised among the heathens, nor were they reputed as vices. Their
gods, their emperors, their philosophers, and their great men in
general, gave them examples of every species of impurity; and they had
no system of ethics which forbade these abominations. The Christian
religion not only discountenances these things, but forbids them on the
most awful penalties; therefore wherever Christianity prevails, these
vices, if practised at all, are obliged to seek the deepest gloom of
midnight to cover them from the eyes of men. On this account they are
comparatively rare, even among the mere professors of Christianity; they
exist, but do not flourish.

[1 Thessalonians 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">th1 4:7</span></span>

God hath not called us unto uncleanness - He is the creator of male and
female, and the institutor of marriage, and he has called men and women
to this state; but the end of this and all the other callings of God to
man is holiness, not uncleanness. And they who use the marriage state as
he directs, will find it conducive to their holiness and perfection.

[1 Thessalonians 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">th1 4:8</span></span>

He therefore that despiseth - He who will not receive these teachings,
and is led either to undervalue or despise them, despises not us but
God, from whom we have received our commission, and by whose Spirit we
give these directions. See Clarke's note on [Th1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#015.md).

Hath also given unto us his Holy Spirit - Instead of εις ἡμας, unto Us,
εις ὑμας, unto You, is the reading of BDEFG, a great many others, the
Syriac, all the Arabic, Armenian, later Syriac in the margin, some of
the Itala, Clement, Didymus, and Ambrosiaster; this seems to be the
better reading. God has taught us that we may teach you; and he has also
given you his Holy Spirit that ye might understand and be enabled to
practice these things. It is one thing to receive a revelation from the
Spirit of God; it is another thing to receive that Spirit to enable a
man to live according to that revelation. In the first sense the
apostles alone received this Holy Spirit; in the latter sense all true
Christians, as well as the Thessalonians, receive it. I think ὑμας, you,
is the true reading, and that it is confirmed by the following verse:
For ye yourselves are Taught of God to love one another. Griesbach has
inserted it in the margin, but has not admitted it into the text,
because it has not what he deemed full support from those MSS. which are
of the Alexandrian recension; but he thought its genuineness very
probable.

[1 Thessalonians 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">th1 4:9</span></span>

Touching brotherly love - They were remarkable for this; and though the
apostle appears to have had this as a topic on which he intended to
write to them, yet, from the account which he received of their
prosperous state by Timothy, he finds that it is unnecessary to spend
any time in inculcating a doctrine which they fully understood and
practised. See [Th1 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#006.md).

[1 Thessalonians 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">th1 4:10</span></span>

Ye do it toward all the brethren - Ye not only love one another at
Thessalonica, but ye love all the brethren in Macedonia; ye consider
them all as children of the same Father; and that all the Churches which
are in Christ make one great and glorious body, of which he is the head.

[1 Thessalonians 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">th1 4:11</span></span>

That ye study to be quiet - Though in general the Church at Thessalonica
was pure and exemplary, yet there seem to have been some idle, tattling
people among them, who disturbed the peace of others; persons who, under
the pretense of religion, gadded about from house to house; did not
work, but were burdensome to others; and were continually meddling with
other people's business, making parties, and procuring their bread by
religious gossiping. To these the apostle gives those directions which
the whole Church of God should enforce wherever such troublesome and
dangerous people are found; viz.: That they should study to be quiet,
ἡσυχαζειν, to hold their peace, as their religious cant will never
promote true religion; that they should do their own business, and let
that of others alone; and that they should work with their own hands,
and not be a burden to the Church of God, or to those well meaning but
weak and inconsiderate people who entertain them, being imposed on by
their apparent sanctity and glozing conversation. An idle person, though
able to discourse like an angel, or pray like an apostle, cannot be a
Christian; all such are hypocrites and deceivers; the true members of
the Church of Christ walk, work, and labor.

[1 Thessalonians 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">th1 4:12</span></span>

That ye may walk honestly - Ευσχημονως· Becomingly, decently,
respectably; as is consistent with the purity, holiness, gravity, and
usefulness of your Christian calling.

Them that are without - The unconverted Gentiles and Jews. See this
expression explained at large on [Col
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#005.md).

That ye may have lack of nothing - That ye may be able to get your bread
by honest labor, which God will ever bless; and be chargeable to no man.
He that is dependent on another is necessarily in bondage; and he who is
able to get his own bread by the sweat of his brow, should not be under
obligation even to a king.

I do not recollect whether, in any other part of this work, I have given
the following story from the Hatem Tai Nameh. Hatem Tai was an Arabian
nobleman, who flourished some time before the Mahommedan era; he was
reputed the most generous and liberal man in all the east. One day he
slew one hundred camels, and made a feast, to which all the Arabian
lords and all the peasantry in the district were invited. About the time
of the feast he took a walk towards a neighboring wood, to see if he
could find any person whom he might invite to partake of the
entertainment which he had then provided. Walking along the skirt of the
wood, he espied an old man coming out of it, laden with a burden of
faggots; he accosted him and asked if he had not heard of the
entertainment made that day by Hatem Tai. The old man answered in the
affirmative. He asked him why he did not attend and partake with the
rest. The old man answered: "He that is able to gain his bread even by
collecting faggots in the wood, should not be beholden even to Hatem
Tai." This is a noble saying, and has long been a rule of conduct to the
writer of this note.

[1 Thessalonians 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">th1 4:13</span></span>

I would not have you to be ignorant - Instead of εχομεν, have, θελομεν,
wish, is the reading of ADEFG, many others, besides the Arabic,
Ethiopic, Armenian, some of the Slavonian, the Vulgate, and Itala, with
many of the Greek fathers. This is undoubtedly the true reading:
Brethren, I would not wish you to be ignorant; or, I would not that you
should be ignorant.

This was probably one of the points which were lacking in their faith,
that he wished to go to Thessalonica to instruct them in.

Them which are asleep - That is, those who are dead. It is supposed that
the apostle had heard that the Thessalonians continued to lament over
their dead, as the heathens did in general who had no hope of the
resurrection of the body; and that they had been puzzled concerning the
doctrine of the resurrection. To set them right on this important
subject, he delivers three important truths:

1\. He asserts, as he had done before, that they who died in the Lord
should have, in virtue of Christ's resurrection, a resurrection unto
eternal life and blessedness.

2\. He makes a new discovery, that the last generation should not die at
all, but be in a moment changed to immortals.

3\. He adds another new discovery, that, though the living should not
die, but be transformed, yet the dead should first be raised, and be
made glorious and immortal; and so, in some measure, have the preference
and advantage of such as shall then be found alive. See Dodd.

[1 Thessalonians 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">th1 4:14</span></span>

For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again - Ει γαρ· Seeing that
we believe; knowing that the resurrection of Christ is as fully
authenticated as his death.

Even so them - It necessarily follows that them who sleep - die, in him
- in the faith of the Gospel, will God bring with him - he will raise
them up as Jesus was raised from the dead, in the same manner, i.e. by
his own eternal power and energy; and he will bring them with him - with
Christ, for he is the head of the Church, which is his body.

[1 Thessalonians 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">th1 4:15</span></span>

This we say unto you by the word of the Lord - This I have, by express
revelation, from the Lord: what he now delivers, he gives as coming
immediately from the Spirit of God. Indeed, human reason could not have
found out the points which he immediately subjoins; no conjectures could
lead to them. Allowing even the general doctrine of the resurrection to
be believed, yet what follows does not flow from the premises; they are
doctrines of pure revelation, and such as never could have been found
out by human ingenuity. In no place does the apostle speak more
confidently and positively of his inspiration than here; and we should
prepare ourselves to receive some momentous and interesting truth.

We which are alive, and remain - By the pronoun we the apostle does not
intend himself, and the Thessalonians to whom he was then writing; he is
speaking of the genuine Christians which shall be found on earth when
Christ comes to judgment. From not considering the manner in which the
apostle uses this word, some have been led to suppose that he imagined
that the day of judgment would take place in that generation, and while
he and the then believers at Thessalonica were in life. But it is
impossible that a man, under so direct an influence of the Holy Spirit,
should be permitted to make such a mistake: nay, no man in the exercise
of his sober reason could have formed such an opinion; there was nothing
to warrant the supposition; no premises from which it could be fairly
deduced; nor indeed any thing in the circumstances of the Church, nor in
the constitution of the world, that could have suggested a hint of the
kind. The apostle is speaking of the thing indefinitely as to the time
when it shall happen, but positively as to the Order that shall be then
observed.

Shall not prevent them which are asleep - Those who shall be found
living in that day, though they shall not pass through death, but be
suddenly changed, shall not go to glory before them that are dead, for
the dead in Christ shall rise first - they shall be raised, their bodies
made glorious, and be caught up to meet the Lord, before the others
shall be changed. And this appears to be the meaning of the apostle's
words, μη φθασωμεν, which we translate shall not prevent; for, although
this word prevent, from prae and venio, literally signifies to go
before, yet we use it now in the sense of to hinder or obstruct. Φθανειν
τινα signifies the same, according to Hesychius, as προηκειν, to go
before, προλαμβανειν, to anticipate, be before. Those who shall be found
alive on that day shall not anticipate glory before the dead in Christ;
for they shall rise first, and begin the enjoyment of it before the
others shall be changed. This appears to be the apostle's meaning.

[1 Thessalonians 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">th1 4:16</span></span>

The Lord himself - That is: Jesus Christ shall descend from heaven;
shall descend in like manner as he was seen by his disciples to ascend,
i.e. in his human form, but now infinitely more glorious; for thousands
of thousands shall minister unto him, and ten thousand times ten
thousand shall stand before him; for the Son of man shall come on the
throne of his glory: but who may abide the day of his coming, or stand
when he appeareth?

With a shout - Or order, εν κελευσματι· and probably in these words:
Arise, ye dead, and come to judgment; which order shall be repeated by
the archangel, who shall accompany it with the sound of the trump of
God, whose great and terrible blasts, like those on mount Sinai,
sounding louder and louder, shall shake both the heavens and the earth!

Observe the order of this terribly glorious day:

1\. Jesus, in all the dignity and splendor of his eternal majesty, shall
descend from heaven to the mid region, what the apostle calls the air,
somewhere within the earth's atmosphere.

2\. Then the κελευσμα, shout or order, shall be given for the dead to
arise.

3\. Next the archangel, as the herald of Christ, shall repeat the order,
Arise, ye dead, and come to judgment!

4\. When all the dead in Christ are raised, then the trumpet shall
sound, as the signal for them all to flock together to the throne of
Christ. It was by the sound of the trumpet that the solemn assemblies,
under the law, were convoked; and to such convocations there appears to
be here an allusion.

5\. When the dead in Christ are raised, their vile bodies being made
like unto his glorious body, then,

6\. Those who are alive shall be changed, and made immortal.

7\. These shall be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the
air.

8\. We may suppose that the judgment will now be set, and the books
opened, and the dead judged out of the things written in those books.

9\. The eternal states of quick and dead being thus determined, then all
who shall be found to have made a covenant with him by sacrifice, and to
have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb,
shall be taken to his eternal glory, and be for ever with the Lord. What
an inexpressibly terrific glory will then be exhibited! I forbear to
call in here the descriptions which men of a poetic turn have made of
this terrible scene, because I cannot trust to their correctness; and it
is a subject which we should speak of and contemplate as nearly as
possible in the words of Scripture.

[1 Thessalonians 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">th1 4:18</span></span>

Comfort one another with these words - Strange saying! comfort a man
with the information that he is going to appear before the judgment-seat
of God! Who can feel comfort from these words? That man alone with whose
spirit the Spirit of God bears witness that his sins are blotted out,
and the thoughts of whose heart are purified by the inspiration of Gods
Holy Spirit, so that he can perfectly love him, and worthily magnify his
name. Reader, thou art not in a safe state unless it be thus with thee,
or thou art hungering and thirsting after righteousness. If so, thou
shalt be filled; for it is impossible that thou shouldst be taken away
in thy sins, while mourning after the salvation of God. They that seek
shall find.
