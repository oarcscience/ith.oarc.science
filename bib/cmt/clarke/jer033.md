### [Jeremiah Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 33:0</span></span>

In this chapter the prophet predicts a restoration of Israel and Judah
to the favor of God, attended with such glorious circumstances as shall
astonish all the world, [Jer 33:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#001.md).
Their prosperity from that period is then described by a beautiful
enumeration of circumstances, [Jer
33:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#010.md). Thus leads to the promise of
the Messiah, the grand subject of the prophetical writings, and the
happiness and stability which the children of Israel shall enjoy under
his government; promises which, in so far as they respect the great body
of the Jews, remain still to be fulfilled, [Jer
33:14-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#014.md).

[Jeremiah 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 33:1</span></span>

Moreover the word of the Lord - This was in the eleventh year of the
reign of Zedekiah, Jeremiah being still shut up in prison: but he was
now in the court of the prison, where the elders and the king's
officers, etc., might consult him with the greater ease; for they
continued to inquire, foolishly thinking, that if he would but prophesy
good things, that these must come, or that he had sufficient power with
God to induce him to alter his mind, - destroy the Chaldeans, and
deliver the city.

[Jeremiah 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 33:2</span></span>

Thus saith the Lord the Maker thereof - עשה osah, the doer of it. That
is, he who is to perform that which he is now about to promise.

Thus translated by Dahler. -

Voici ce que dit l'Eternel, qui fait ce qu'il a dit. -

"Thus saith the Lord, who doth that which he hath said."

The word Jehovah, not Lord, should be used in all such places as this.

[Jeremiah 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 33:3</span></span>

Call unto eve, and I will answer thee - To me alone it belongs to reveal
what is future; and the stupendous things which are now coming are known
only to myself. These idolaters go to their gods to get information
relative to the issue of the present commotions; but there is no light
in them. Ask thou, O Jeremiah, and I will tell thee the great and mighty
things which even thou knowest not.

[Jeremiah 33:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 33:4</span></span>

Thus saith the Lord - This is a new confirmation of what has already
been said, viz., The city shall fall, a number of the inhabitants shall
perish, the rest shall be carried into captivity; but the nation shall
be preserved, and the people return from their captivity.

[Jeremiah 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 33:6</span></span>

Behold I will bring it health and, cure - ארכה aruchah, an extensive
plaister; or, as we phrase it, a plaister as large as the sore. I will
repair the losses of families by numerous births, and bless the land
with fertility.

[Jeremiah 33:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 33:7</span></span>

The captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel - This must respect
the latter times, for the ten tribes did not return with the Jews at the
termination of the seventy years.

[Jeremiah 33:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 33:8</span></span>

I will cleanse them - These promises of pardon and holiness must be
referred to their state under the Gospel, when they shall have received
Jesus as the promised Messiah.

[Jeremiah 33:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 33:9</span></span>

They shall fear and tremble - The surrounding nations shall be persuaded
that it is the hand of the Almighty that has wrought this change in your
behalf; and shall fear to molest you, and tremble lest they should incur
the displeasure of your God by doing you any kind of evil.

[Jeremiah 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 33:11</span></span>

The voice of them that shall say, Praise the Lord of hosts - That is,
the voice of the Levites in the sacred service: intimating that the
temple should be rebuilt, and the public service restored.

[Jeremiah 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 33:12</span></span>

A habitation of shepherds - See on [Jer
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#012) (note.md).

[Jeremiah 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 33:14</span></span>

Behold the days come - See [Jer 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005.md),
and [Jer 31:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031.md).

That good thing which I have promised - By my prophets: for those who
have predicted the captivity have also foretold its conclusion, though
not in such express terms as Jeremiah did. See [Hos
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#010.md), etc.; [Hos
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#015.md), etc.; [Hos
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#011.md), etc.; [Amo
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#014.md), etc., and [Jer
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#012.md), etc. The end of the captivity
has been foretold by Micah, [Mic 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#009.md),
etc.; Zephaniah, [Zep 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#010.md), etc.; and
by Jeremiah, [Jer 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#015.md); [Jer
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#003.md); [Jer
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010.md); [Jer
32:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#037.md). The Targum explains [Jer
32:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#014.md), [Jer
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#015.md), and [Jer
32:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#016.md) of the Messiah.

[Jeremiah 33:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 33:16</span></span>

And this is the name wherewith she shall be called, The Lord our
Righteousness - See what has been said on [Jer
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006) (note.md), which is generally
supposed to be a strictly parallel passage: but they are very different,
and I doubt whether they mean exactly the same thing. As to our
translation here, it is ignorant, and almost impious; it says that
Jerusalem, for that is the antecedent, shall be called The Lord our
Righteousness. The pronoun לה lah, which is translated her, is the
masculine affix, in the Chaldaic form, which frequently occurs; and Dr.
Blayney translates, "And this is He whom Jehovah shall call our
righteousness," or Justification. Perhaps there is a sense which these
words will bear far more congenial to the scope of the place. I will
give the original, as before: וזה אשר יקרא לה יהוה צדקנו vezeh asher
yikra lah, Yehovah tsidkenu, "And this one who shall call to her is the
Lord our Justification;" that is, the salvation of the Jews shall take
place when Jesus Christ is proclaimed to them as their Justifier, and
they receive him as such.

Instead of לה lah, her or him, Chaldaice, the Vulgate, Chaldee, and
Syriac have read לו lo, him, less ambiguously; and this reading is
supported by one or two MSS. This emendation renders the passage here
more conformable to that in [Jer 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006.md);
but if the translation above be admitted, all embarrassment is gone.

One of my own MSS. has לה loh, with the masculine points, and no mappik
on the ה he; and for tsidkenu has צדקינו tsidkeynu, the contracted
plural form, our righteousness: but this may be a mistake. The passages
in this and the twenty-third chapter were not, I am satisfied, intended
to express the same thing. I suppose that above refers to the preaching
or proclaiming Christ crucified to the Jews, when the time shall arrive
in which they shall be incorporated with the Gentile Church. Dahler
translates this as he did that in chap. 23, which is a perfect
oversight: but paraphrastic renderings are too often introduced by this
learned foreigner.

[Jeremiah 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 33:18</span></span>

Neither shall the priests the Levites want a man - This is a repetition
of the promise made to Phinehas, [Num
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#013.md).

[Jeremiah 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 33:20</span></span>

If ye can break my covenant of the day - See the note on [Jer
31:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#036.md).

[Jeremiah 33:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 33:22</span></span>

So will I multiply the seed of David - This must be understood of the
spiritual David, Jesus Christ, and his progeny, genuine Christians. The
two families which God chose for the priesthood, that of Aaron and
Phinehas, or, on its being taken away from him, that of Ithamar, [Sa1
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#035.md), are both extinct. Nor has the
office of high priest, or priest of any kind offering sacrifice, been
exercised among the Jews for nearly eighteen hundred years; therefore
what is said here of the priesthood must refer to the spiritual
priesthood, at the head of which is Jesus Christ.

[Jeremiah 33:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 33:24</span></span>

The two families which the Lord hath chosen - Some think these refer to
the two kingdoms of Israel and Judah; but they never can be considered
as two distinct families, being of one and the same race. Others think
that the families of Jacob and David are intended; but neither were
these distinct. If the two families which had the priesthood be not
meant, then the regal family of David, and the sacerdotal family of
Jacob through Levi, may be designed. See [Jer
33:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#026.md). Following the spiritual
interpretation, neither the regal nor sacerdotal family has failed; for
Jesus is a King and a Priest, and all true believers in him are kings
and priests unto God and the Lamb. And the highest King that ever
reigned is He who is the seed of David, King of kings and Lord of lords,
who has all power in heaven and in earth.
