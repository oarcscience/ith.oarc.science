### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa2 19:0</span></span>

David continues his lamentation for his son, and the people are greatly
discouraged, [Sa2 19:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#001.md). Joab
reproves and threatens him with the general defection of the people,
[Sa2 19:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#005.md). David lays aside his
mourning, and shows himself to the people, who are thereby encouraged,
[Sa2 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#008.md). The tribes take counsel to
bring the king back to Jerusalem, [Sa2
19:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#009.md). He makes Amasa captain of the
host in place of Joab, [Sa2 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#013.md). The
king, returning, is met by Judah at Gilgal, [Sa2
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#014.md), [Sa2
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#015.md). Shimei comes to meet David, and
entreats for his life, which David grants, [Sa2
19:16-23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#016.md). Mephibosheth also meets him,
and shows how he had been slandered by Ziba, [Sa2
19:24-30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#024.md). David is met by Barzillai,
and between them there is an affecting interview, [Sa2
19:31-40](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#031.md). Contention between the men
of Judah and the men of Israel, about bringing back the king, [Sa2
19:41-43](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#041.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 19:2</span></span>

The victory - was turned into mourning - Instead of rejoicing that a
most unnatural and ruinous rebellion had been quashed, the people
mourned over their own success, because they saw their king so
immoderately afflicted for the loss of his worthless son.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa2 19:4</span></span>

The king covered his face - This was the custom of mourners.

O my son Absalom - Calmet has properly remarked that the frequent
repetition of the name of the defunct, is common in the language of
lamentation. Thus Virgil, act. v., ver. 51: -

\- Daphnin que team tollemus ad astra;

Daphnin ad astra feremus: amavit nos quoque Daphnis.

"With yours, my song I cheerfully shall join,

To raise your Daphnis to the powers Divine.

Daphnis I'll raise unto the powers above,

For dear to me was Daphnis' well tried love."

See the notes on the preceding chapter, 2 Samuel 18 (note).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa2 19:5</span></span>

Thou hast shamed this day - Joab's speech to David on his immoderate
grief for the death of his rebellious son is not only remarkable for the
insolence of office, but also for good sense and firmness. Every man who
candidly considers the state of the case, must allow that David acted
imprudently at least; and that Joab's firm reproof was necessary to
arouse him to a sense of his duty to his people. But still, in his
manner, Joab had far exceeded the bonds of that reverence which a
servant owes to his master, or a subject to his prince. Joab was a good
soldier, but in every respect a bad man, and a dangerous subject.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 19:8</span></span>

The king - sat in the gate - The place where justice was administered to
the people.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 19:11</span></span>

Speak unto the elders of Judah - David was afraid to fall out with this
tribe: they were in possession of Jerusalem, and this was a city of
great importance to him. They had joined Absalom in his rebellion; and
doubtless were now ashamed of their conduct. David appears to take no
notice of their infidelity, but rather to place confidence in them, that
their confidence in him might be naturally excited: and, to oblige them
yet farther, purposes to make Amasa captain of the host in the place of
Joab.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 19:14</span></span>

And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah - The measures that he
pursued were the best calculated that could be to accomplish this
salutary end. Appear to distrust those whom you have some reason to
suspect, and you increase their caution and distrust. Put as much
confidence in them as you safely can, and this will not fail to excite
their confidence towards you.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 19:16</span></span>

Shimei the son of Gera - It appears that Shimei was a powerful chieftain
in the land; for he had here, in his retinue, no less than a thousand
men.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 19:18</span></span>

There went over a ferry-boat - This is the first mention of any thing of
the kind. Some think a bridge or raft is what is here intended.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa2 19:20</span></span>

For thy servant doth know that I have sinned - This was all he could do;
his subsequent conduct alone could prove his sincerity. On such an
avowal as this David could not but grant him his life.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa2 19:24</span></span>

Neither dressed his feet - He had given the fullest proof of his sincere
attachment to David and his cause; and by what he had done, amply
refuted the calumnies of his servant Ziba.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa2 19:27</span></span>

The king is as an angel of God - As if he had said, I state my case
plainly and without guile; thou art too wise not to penetrate the
motives from which both myself and servant have acted. I shall make no
appeal; with whatsoever thou determinest I shall rest contented.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">sa2 19:29</span></span>

I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land - At first, David gave the
land of Saul to Mephibosheth; and Ziba, his sons, and his servants, were
to work that land; and to Mephibosheth, as the lord, he was to give the
half of the produce. Ziba met David in his distress with provisions, and
calumniated Mephibosheth: David, too slightly trusting to his
misrepresentation, and supposing that Mephibosheth was actually such a
traitor as Ziba represented him, made him on the spot a grant of his
master's land. Now he finds that he has acted too rashly, and therefore
confirms the former grant; i.e. that Ziba should cultivate the ground,
and still continue to give to Mephibosheth, as the lord, the half of the
produce. This was merely placing things in statu quo, and utterly
annulling the gift that he had made to Ziba. But why did he leave this
treacherous man any thing? Answer,

1\. He was one of the domestics of Saul, and David wished to show
kindness to that house.

2\. He had supplied him with the necessaries of life when he was in the
greatest distress; and he thinks proper to continue him in his old
office, by way of remuneration.

But it was certainly too great a compensation for his services, however
then important, when all the circumstances are considered.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">sa2 19:32</span></span>

Barzillai was a very aged man - This venerable person had given full
proof of his attachment to David by the supplies he had given him when
he lay at Mahanaim, where his case was all but desperate; the sincerity
of his congratulations now none can suspect. David's offer to him was at
once noble and liberal: he wished to compensate such a man, and he
wished to have at hand such a friend.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">sa2 19:35</span></span>

Can thy servant taste what I eat - Here is at once an affecting
description of the infirmities of old age; and a correct account of the
mode of living at an Eastern court in ancient times.

Barzillai was fourscore years old; his ear was become dull of hearing,
and his relish for his food was gone: he therefore appears to have been
not only an old man, but an infirm old man. Besides delicate meats and
drinks, we find that vocal music constituted a principal part of court
entertainments: male and female singers made a necessary appendage to
these banquets, as they do in most Eastern courts to the present day. As
David was a most sublime poet, and emphatically styled the sweet singer
of Israel, he no doubt had his court well supplied with vocal as well as
instrumental performers; and, probably, with poets and poetesses; for it
is not likely that he was the only poet of his time, though he
undoubtedly was the most excellent.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">sa2 19:37</span></span>

Thy servant Chimham - It is generally understood that this was
Barzillai's son; and this is probable from [Kg1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#007.md), where, when David was dying, he
said, Show kindness to the sons of Barzillai: and it is very probable
that this Chimham was one of them. In [Jer
41:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#017.md) mention is made of the
habitation of Chimham, which was near to Bethlehem; and it is reasonably
conjectured that David had left that portion, which was probably a part
of his paternal estate, to this son of Barzillai.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:39](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">sa2 19:39</span></span>

The king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him - The kiss was the token of
friendship and farewell; the blessing was a prayer to God for his
prosperity, probably a prophetical benediction.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:42](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">sa2 19:42</span></span>

Wherefore then be ye angry for this matter? - We have not done this for
our own advantage; we have gained nothing by it; we did it through loyal
attachment to our king.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:43](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">sa2 19:43</span></span>

We have ten parts in the king, and - more right - We are ten tribes to
one, or we are ten times so many as you; and consequently should have
been consulted in this business.

The words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of
Israel - They had more weight, for they had more reason on their side.

It is pleasant when every province, canton, district, and county, vie
with each other in personal attachment to the prince, and loyal
attachment to his government. From such contentions as these civil wars
are never likely to arise. And how blessed it must be for the country
where the king merits all this! where the prince is the pastor and
father of his people, and in all things the minister of and to them for
good!

It is criminal in the prince not to endeavor to deserve the confidence
and love of his people; and it is highly criminal in the people not to
repay such endeavors with the most loyal and affectionate attachment.

Where the government is not despotic, the king acts by the counsels of
his ministers, and while he does so he is not chargeable with
miscarriages and misfortunes; they either came through bad counsels, or
directly thwarting providences. On this ground is that political maxim
in our laws formed, the king can do no wrong. Sometimes God will have
things otherwise than the best counsels have determined, because he sees
that the results will, on the whole, be better for the peace and
prosperity of that state. "God is the only Ruler of princes." And as the
peace of the world depends much on civil government, hence kings and
civil governors are peculiar objects of the Almighty's care. Wo to him
who labors to bring about a general disaffection; as such things almost
invariably end in general disappointment and calamity. It is much easier
to unsettle than to settle; to pull down than to build up.
