### [1 Corinthians Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#001.md)

[1 Corinthians](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">co1 10:0</span></span>

Peculiar circumstances in the Jewish history were typical of the
greatest mysteries of the Gospel; particularly their passing through the
Red Sea, and being overshadowed with the miraculous cloud, [Co1
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#001.md), [Co1
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#002.md). The manna with which they were
fed, [Co1 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#003.md). And rock out of which
they drank, [Co1 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#004.md). The punishments
inflicted on them for their disobedience are warnings to us, [Co1
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#005.md). We should not lust as they did,
[Co1 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#006.md). Nor commit idolatry, [Co1
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#007.md). Nor fornication as they did; in
consequence of which twenty-three thousand of them were destroyed, [Co1
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#008.md). Nor tempt Christ as they did,
[Co1 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#009.md). Nor murmur, [Co1
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#010.md). All these transgressions and
their punishments are recorded as warnings to us, that we may not fall
away from the grace of God, [Co1
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#011.md), [Co1
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#012.md). God never suffers any to be
tempted above their strength, [Co1
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#013.md). Idolatry must be detested, [Co1
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#014.md). And the sacrament of the Lord's
Supper properly considered and taken, that God may not be provoked to
punish us, [Co1 10:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#015.md). There are
some things which may be legally done which are not expedient; and we
should endeavor so to act as to edify each other, [Co1
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#023.md), [Co1
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#024.md). The question concerning eating
things offered to idols considered, and finally settled, [Co1
10:25-30](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#025.md). We should do all things to
the glory of God, avoid whatsoever might be the means of stumbling
another, and seek the profit of others in spiritual matters rather than
our own gratification, [Co1 10:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#031.md).

[1 Corinthians 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 10:1</span></span>

I would not that ye should be ignorant - It seems as if the Corinthians
had supposed that their being made partakers of the ordinances of the
Gospel, such as baptism and the Lord's Supper, would secure their
salvation, notwithstanding they might be found partaking of idolatrous
feasts; as long, at least, as they considered an idol to be nothing in
the world. To remove this destructive supposition, which would have led
them to endless errors both in principle and practice, the apostle shows
that the Jews had sacramental ordinances in the wilderness, similar to
those of the Christians; and that, notwithstanding they had the typical
baptism from the cloud, and the typical eucharist from the paschal lamb,
and the manna that came down from heaven, yet, when they joined with
idolaters and partook of idolatrous feasts, God was not only displeased
with them, but signified this displeasure by pouring out his judgments
upon them, so that in one day 23,000 of them were destroyed.

Under the cloud - It is manifest from Scripture that the miraculous
cloud in the wilderness performed a three-fold office to the Israelites.

1\. It was a cloud in the form of a pillar to direct their journeyings
by day.

2\. It was a pillar of fire to give light to the camp by night.

3\. It was a covering for them during the day, and preserved them from
the scorching rays of the sun; and supplied them with a sufficiency of
aqueous particles, not only to cool that burning atmosphere, but to give
refreshment to themselves and their cattle; and its humidity was so
abundant that the apostle here represents the people as thoroughly
sprinkled and enveloped in its aqueous vapour. See the note on [Exo
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021.md).

[1 Corinthians 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 10:2</span></span>

And were all baptized unto Moses - Rather Into Moses - into the covenant
of which Moses was the mediator; and by this typical baptism they were
brought under the obligation of acting according to the Mosaic precepts,
as Christians receiving Christian baptism are said to be baptized Into
Christ, and are thereby brought under obligation to keep the precepts of
the Gospel.

[1 Corinthians 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 10:3</span></span>

Spiritual meat - The manna which is here called spiritual.

1\. Because it was provided supernaturally; and,

2\. Because it was a type of Christ Jesus, who speaking of it, [Joh
6:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#031.md), etc., tells us that it was a
type of that true bread which came down from heaven, which gives life to
the world, [Joh 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#033.md), and that himself
was the bread of life, [Joh 6:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#048.md).

[1 Corinthians 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 10:4</span></span>

Spiritual drink - By the βρωμα πνευματικον spiritual meat, and πομα
πνευματικον, spiritual drink, the apostle certainly means both meat and
drink, which were furnished to the Israelitish assembly miraculously, as
well as typically: and he appears to borrow his expression from the Jews
themselves, who expressly say הלחם הלז רוחני hallechem hallaz ruchani,
that bread was spiritual, and מיים רוחניים היו meyim ruchainiyim haiu,
the waters were spiritual. Alschech in legem. fol. 238, to which opinion
the apostle seems particularly to refer. See Schoettgen.

The spiritual rock that followed them - There is some difficulty in this
verse. How could the rock follow them? It does not appear that the rock
ever moved from the place where Moses struck it. But to solve this
difficulty, it is said that rock here is put, by metonymy, for the water
of the rock; and that this water did follow them through the wilderness.
This is more likely; but we have not direct proof of it. The ancient
Jews, however, were of this opinion, and state that the streams followed
them in all their journeyings, up the mountains, down the valleys, etc.,
etc.; and that when they came to encamp, the waters formed themselves
into cisterns and pools; and that the rulers of the people guided them,
by their staves, in rivulets to the different tribes and families. And
this is the sense they give to [Num
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#017.md) : Spring up, O well, etc. See
the places in Schoettgen.

Others contend, that by the rock following them we are to understand
their having carried of its waters with them on their journeyings. This
we know is a common custom in these deserts to the present day; and that
the Greek verb ακολουθεω, to follow, has this sense, Bishop Pearce has
amply proved in his note on this place. The Jews suppose that the rock
itself went with the Israelites, and was present with them in their
thirty-eight stations, for only so many are mentioned. See Alschech in
legem. fol. 236. And see Schoettgen.

Now, though of all the senses already given that of Bishop Pearce is the
best, yet it does appear that the apostle does not speak about the rock
itself, but of Him whom it represented; namely, Christ: this was the
Rock that followed them, and ministered to them; and this view of the
subject is rendered more probable by what is said [Co1
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#009.md), that they tempted Christ, and
were destroyed by serpents. The same rock is in the vale of Rephidim to
the present day; and it bears aboriginal marks of the water that flowed
from it in the fissures that appear on its sides. It is one block of
fine granite, about seven yards long, five broad, and - high. A fragment
of this typical rock now lies before me, brought by a relative of my
own, who broke it off, and did not let it pass into any hand till he
placed it in mine. See the note on [Exo
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#006.md).

[1 Corinthians 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 10:5</span></span>

They were overthrown in the wilderness - And yet All these persons were
under the cloud - All passed through the sea - All were baptized into
Moses in the cloud and in the sea - All ate the same spiritual meat -
All drank the same spiritual drink, for they were made partakers of the
spiritual Rock, Christ. Nothing can be a more decisive proof than this
that people, who have every outward ordinance, and are made partakers of
the grace of our Lord Jesus, may so abuse their privileges and grieve
the Spirit of God as to fall from their state of grace, and perish ever
lastingly. Let those who are continually asserting that this is
impossible, beware lest they themselves, if in a state of grace, become,
through their overmuch security, proofs in point of the possibility of
ending in the flesh, though they began in the Spirit. Reader, remember
who said, Ye shall not surely die; and remember the mischiefs produced
by a belief of his doctrine.

[1 Corinthians 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 10:6</span></span>

These things were our examples - The punishments which God inflicted on
them furnish us with evidences of what God will inflict upon us, if we
sin after the similitude of those transgressors.

We should not lust after evil things - It is most evident that the
apostle refers here to the history in [Num
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#004.md), etc.: And the mixed multitude
fell a lusting, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat? Into the same
spirit the Corinthians had most evidently fallen; they lusted after the
flesh in the idol feasts, and therefore frequented them to the great
scandal of Christianity. The apostle shows them that their sin was of
the same nature as that of the murmuring rebellious Israelites whom God
so severely punished; and if he did not spare the natural branches,
there was no likelihood that he should spare them.

[1 Corinthians 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 10:7</span></span>

Neither be ye idolaters - The apostle considers partaking of the
idolatrous feasts as being real acts of idolatry; because those who
offered the flesh to their gods considered them as feeding invisibly
with them on the flesh thus offered, and that every one that partook of
the feast was a real participator with the god to whom the flesh or
animal had been offered in sacrifice. See [Co1
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#021.md).

Rose up to play - See the note on [Exo
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#006.md). The Jews generally explain this
word as implying idolatrous acts only: I have considered it as implying
acts of impurity, with which idolatrous acts were often accompanied. It
also means those dances which were practised in honor of their gods.
That this is one meaning of the verb παιζειν, Kypke has largely proved.
The whole idolatrous process was as follows:

1\. The proper victim was prepared and set apart.

2\. It was slain, and its blood poured out at the altar of the deity.

3\. The flesh was dressed, and the priests and offerers feasted on it,
and thus endeavored to establish a communion between themselves and the
object of their worship.

4\. After eating, they had idolatrous dances in honor of their god; and,

5\. as might be expected, impure mixtures, in consequence of those
dances. The people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play;
and it is in reference to this issue of idolatrous feasts and dancings
that the apostle immediately subjoins: Neither let us commit
Fornication, etc.

[1 Corinthians 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 10:8</span></span>

Fell in one day three and twenty thousand - In [Num
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#009.md), the number is 24,000; and,
allowing this to be the genuine reading, (and none of the Hebrew MSS.
exhibit any various reading in the place), Moses and the apostle may be
thus reconciled: in [Num 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#004.md), God
commands Moses to take all the heads (the rulers) of the people, and
hang them up before the Lord against the sun; these possibly amounted to
1000, and those who fell by the plague were 23,000, so that the whole
amounted to 24,000. Instead of εικοσιτρεις χιλιαδες, 23,000, two MSS.,
with the later Syriac and the Armenian, have εικοσιτεσσαρες χιλιαδες,
24,000; but this authority is too slender to establish a various
reading, which recedes so much from the received text. I think the
discordance may be best accounted for by supposing, as above, that
Phineas and his companions might have slain 1000 men, who were heads of
the people, and chief in this idolatry; and that the plague sent from
the Lord destroyed 23,000 more; so an equal number to the whole tribe of
Levi perished in one day, who were just 23,000. See [Num
26:62](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#062.md); and see Lightfoot.

[1 Corinthians 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 10:9</span></span>

Neither let us tempt Christ - I have already supposed, in the note on
[Co1 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#004) (note.md), that Christ is
intended by the spiritual rock that followed them: and that it was he,
not the rock, that did follow or accompany the Israelites in the
wilderness. This was the angel of God's presence who was with the Church
in the wilderness, to whom our fathers would not obey, as St. Stephen
says, [Act 7:38](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#038.md), [Act
7:39](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#039.md). Instead of Χριστον, Christ,
several MSS. and a few versions have Κυριον, the Lord, and some few
Θεον, God. But though some respectable MSS. have the Lord instead of
Christ, yet this latter has the greatest proportion of authority on its
side. And this affords no mean proof that the person who is called יהוה
Yehovah in the Old Testament, is called Christ in the New. By tempting
Christ is meant disbelieving the providence and goodness of God; and
presuming to prescribe to him how he should send them the necessary
supplies, and of what kind they should be, etc.

[1 Corinthians 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 10:10</span></span>

Neither murmur ye - How the Israelites murmured because of the manna,
which their souls despised as a light bread - something incapable of
affording them nourishment, etc., and because they had been brought out
of Egypt into the wilderness, and pretended that the promises of God had
failed; and how they were destroyed by serpents, and by the destroyer or
plague; may be seen at large in the texts referred to in the margin on
this and the preceding verses. It appears from what the apostle says
here, that the Corinthians were murmuring against God and his apostle
for prohibiting them from partaking of the idolatrous feasts, just as
the Israelites did in the wilderness in reference to a similar subject.
See the history of Phineas, with Zimri and Cosbi, and the rebellion of
Corah and his company, etc., etc.

Destroyed of the destroyer - The Jews suppose that God employed
destroying angels to punish those rebellious Israelites; they were five
in number, and one of them they call משחית Meshachith, the destroyer;
which appears to be another name for Samael, the angel of death, to
whose influence they attribute all deaths which are not uncommon or
violent. Those who die violent deaths, or deaths that are not in the
common manner of men, are considered as perishing by immediate judgments
from God.

[1 Corinthians 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 10:11</span></span>

Upon whom the ends of the world are come - Τα τελη των αιωνων· The end
of the times included within the whole duration of the Mosaic economy.
For although the word αιων means, in its primary sense, endless being,
or duration; yet, in its accommodated sense, it is applied to any round
or duration that is complete in itself: and here it evidently means the
whole duration of the Mosaic economy. "Thus, therefore," says Dr.
Lightfoot, "the apostle speaks in this place that those things, which
were transacted in the beginning of the Jewish ages, are written for an
example to you upon whom the ends of those ages are come; and the
beginning is like to the end, and the end to the beginning. Both were
forty years; both consisted of temptation and unbelief; and both ended
in the destruction of the unbelievers - that, in the destruction of
those who perished in the wilderness; this, in the destruction of those
that believed not: viz. the destruction of their city and nation." The
phrase סוף יומיא soph yomaiya, the end of days, says the Targum of
Jerusalem, [Gen 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015.md), means ביומוי
דמלכא משיחא beyomoi demalca Meshicha, in the days of the King Messiah.
We are to consider the apostle's words as referring to the end of the
Jewish dispensation and the commencement of the Christian, which is the
last dispensation which God will vouchsafe to man in the state of
probation.

[1 Corinthians 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 10:12</span></span>

Let him that thinketh he standeth - Ὁ δοκων ἑσταναι· Let him who most
confidently standeth - him who has the fullest conviction in his own
conscience that his heart is right with God, and that his mind is right
in the truth, take heed lest he fall from his faith, and from the state
of holiness in which the grace of God has placed him. I have already
shown that the verb δοκειν, which we render to seem, to think, to
suppose, is used by the best Greek writers, not to lessen or weaken the
sense, but to render it stronger and more emphatic. See the note on [Luk
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#018.md).

In a state of probation every thing may change; while we are in this
life we may stand or fall: our standing in the faith depends on our
union with God; and that depends on our watching unto prayer, and
continuing to possess that faith that worketh by love. The highest saint
under heaven can stand no longer than he depends upon God and continues
in the obedience of faith. He that ceases to do so will fall into sin,
and get a darkened understanding and a hardened heart: and he may
continue in this state till God come to take away his soul. Therefore,
let him who most assuredly standeth, take heed lest he fall; not only
partially, but finally.

[1 Corinthians 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 10:13</span></span>

But such as is common to man - Ανθρωπινος· Chrysostom has properly
translated this word ανθρωπινος, τουτεστι μικρος, βραχυς, συμμετρος;
that is, small, short, moderate. Your temptations or trials have been
but trifling in comparison of those endured by the Israelites; they
might have been easily resisted and overcome. Besides, God will not
suffer you to be tried above the strength he gives you; but as the trial
comes, he will provide you with sufficient strength to resist it; as the
trial comes in, he will make your way out. The words are very
remarkable, ποιησει συν τῳ πειρασμῳ και την εκβασιν, "He will, with the
temptation, make the deliverance, or way out." Satan is never permitted
to block up our way, without the providence of God making a way through
the wall. God ever makes a breach in his otherwise impregnable
fortification. Should an upright soul get into difficulties and straits,
he may rest assured that there is a way out, as there was a way in; and
that the trial shall never be above the strength that God shall give him
to bear it.

[1 Corinthians 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co1 10:14</span></span>

Therefore - flee from idolatry - This is a trial of no great magnitude;
to escape from so gross a temptation requires but a moderate portion of
grace and circumspection.

[1 Corinthians 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co1 10:15</span></span>

I speak as to wise men - The Corinthians valued themselves not a little
on their wisdom and various gifts; the apostle admits this, and draws an
argument from it against themselves. As ye are so wise, surely ye can
see the propriety of abominating idolatry of every kind: for an idol is
nothing in the world, and can do nothing for you and nothing against
you.

[1 Corinthians 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co1 10:16</span></span>

The cup of blessing - The apostle speaks here of the Eucharist, which he
illustrates by the כוס הברכה cos habberacah, cup of blessing, over which
thanks were expressed at the conclusion of the passover. See this
largely explained at the conclusion of the notes on [Mat
26:75](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#075.md), and in my Discourse upon the
Eucharist, 8vo. 2nd edit. 1814.

The communion of the blood of Christ? - We who partake of this sacred
cup, in commemoration of the death of Christ, are made partakers of his
body and blood, and thus have fellowship with him; as those who partake
of an idol feast, thereby, as much as they can, participate with the
idol, to whom the sacrifice was offered. This I have proved at large in
the above tract, to which I must refer the reader, as the subject is too
voluminous to be inserted here.

[1 Corinthians 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co1 10:17</span></span>

For we, being many, are one bread - The original would be better
translated thus: Because there is one bread, or loaf; we, who are many,
are one body. As only one loaf was used at the passover, and those who
partook of it were considered to be one religious body; so we who
partake of the eucharistical bread and wine, in commemoration of the
sacrificial death of Christ, are one spiritual society, because we are
all made partakers of that one Christ whose blood was shed for us to
make an atonement for our sins; as the blood of the paschal lamb was
shed and sprinkled in reference to this of which it was the type.

[1 Corinthians 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co1 10:18</span></span>

Behold Israel after the flesh - The Jews not yet converted to
Christianity: the latter being Israel after the Spirit. As the design of
the apostle was to withdraw his converts at Corinth from all temptations
to idolatry, he produces two examples to show the propriety of his
endeavors.

1\. All who join together in celebrating the Lord's Supper, and are
partakers of that one bread, give proof by this that they are
Christians, and have fellowship with Christ.

2\. All the Israelites who offer sacrifice, and partake of those
sacrifices, give proof thereby that they are Jews, and are in fellowship
with the object of their worship: so they who join in idol festivals,
and eat things which have been offered to idols, give proof that they
are in communion with those idolaters, and that they have fellowship
with the demons they worship.

[1 Corinthians 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co1 10:19</span></span>

What say I then? - A Jewish phrase for, I conclude; and this is his
conclusion: that although an idol is nothing, has neither power nor
influence, nor are things offered to idols any thing the worse for being
thus offered; yet, as the things sacrificed by the Gentiles are
sacrificed to demons and not to God, those who partake of them have
fellowship with demons: those who profess Christianity cannot have
fellowship both with Christ and the devil.

[1 Corinthians 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co1 10:21</span></span>

Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord - It is in vain that you who
frequent these idol festivals profess the religion of Christ, and
commemorate his death and passion in the holy eucharist; for you can not
have that fellowship with Christ which this ordinance implies, while you
are partakers of the table of demons. That the Gentiles, in their
sacrifices, fed on the slain beasts, and ate bread and drank wine in
honor of their gods, is sufficiently clear from various accounts. See my
Discourse on the Holy Eucharist, where many examples are produced. The
following from Virgil, Aen. viii, verse 179-273, is proof in point: -

Tum lecti juvenes certatim araeque sacerdos

Viscera tosta ferunt taurorum, onerantque canistris

Dona laboratae Cereris, Bacchumque ministrant.

Vescitur Aeneas simul et Trojana juventus

Perpetui tergo bovis et lustralibus extis. -

Quare agite, O juvenes, tantarum in munere laudum,

Cingite fronde comas, et pocula porgite dextris,

Communemque vocate Deum, et date vina volentes.

The loaves were served in canisters; the wine

In bowls; the priests renewed the rites divine:

Broiled entrails are their food, and beef's continued chine

Ye warlike youths, your heads with garlands crown,

Fill high the goblets with a sparkling flood,

And with deep draughts invoke our common god.

[1 Corinthians 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">co1 10:22</span></span>

Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? - All idolatry is represented as a
sort of spiritual adultery; it is giving that heart to Satan that should
be devoted to God; and he is represented as being jealous, because of
the infidelity of those who have covenanted to give their hearts to him.

Are we stronger than he? - As he has threatened to punish such
transgressors, and will infallibly do it, can we resist his omnipotence?
A sinner should consider, while he is in rebellion against God, whether
he be able to resist that power whereby God will inflict vengeance.

[1 Corinthians 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">co1 10:23</span></span>

All things are lawful for me - I may lawfully eat all kinds of food, but
all are not expedient; ου παντα συμφερει· It would not be becoming in me
to eat of all, because I should by this offend and grieve many weak
minds. See the notes on [Co1 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#012.md),
etc.

[1 Corinthians 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">co1 10:24</span></span>

Let no man seek his own, etc. - Let none, for his private gratification
or emolument, disturb the peace or injure the soul of another. Let every
man live, not for himself, but for every part of the great human family
with which he is surrounded.

[1 Corinthians 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">co1 10:25</span></span>

Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat - The case to which the
apostle refers is simply this; it was customary to bring the flesh of
the animal to market, the blood of which had been poured out in
sacrifice to an idol; or, taken more particularly, the case was this;
one part of the sacrifice was consumed on the altar of the idol: a
second part was dressed and eaten by the sacrificer; and a third
belonged to the priest, and was often sold in the shambles. To partake
of the second share, or to feast upon the sacrifice, St. Paul absolutely
forbids, because this was one part of the religious worship which was
paid to the idol; it was sitting down as guests at his table, in token
that they were in fellowship with him. This was utterly incompatible
with receiving the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, which was the
communion of the body and blood of Christ. But as to the third share,
the apostle leaves them at liberty either to eat of it or forbear;
except that, by eating, their weak brethren should be offended; in that
case, though the thing was lawful, it was their duty to abstain. See the
notes on [Co1 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#001.md), etc. Hindoos
eagerly embrace whatever has been offered to an idol: hence it is common
to see the flowers that have been thus offered placed in the hair of a
Hindoo. Water that has been thus made sacred is preserved in Hindoo
houses, and with it they rub their bodies, and occasionally sip a drop,
regarding it as the water of life. - See Ward.

Asking no questions for consciences sake - Dr. Lightfoot observes, that
"the Jews were vexed with innumerable scruples in their feasts, as to
the eating of the thing, as well as to the company with which they ate;
and even the manner of their eating. Of fruits and herbs brought to the
table, they were to inquire whether they were tithed according to
custom; whether they were consecrated by the Truma, or whether they were
profane; whether they were clean, or touched with some pollution, etc.
And concerning flesh set on the table, they were to inquire whether it
was of that which had been offered to idols; whether it were the flesh
of an animal that had been torn by wild beasts; or of that which had
been strangled, or not killed according to the canons; etc., etc. All
which doubts the liberty of the Gospel abolished as to one's own
conscience, with this proviso, that no scandal or offense be cast before
another man's weak or scrupulous conscience."

From this it is evident that the apostle had the case of the Jewish
converts in view, and not the Gentiles. The latter were not troubled
with such extraordinary scrupulousness.

[1 Corinthians 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">co1 10:26</span></span>

For the earth is the Lord's - And because God made the earth and its
fullness, all animals, plants, and vegetables, there can be nothing in
it or them impure or unholy; because all are the creatures of God.

[1 Corinthians 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">co1 10:27</span></span>

If any - bid you to a feast - The apostle means any common meal, not an
idol festival; for to such no Christian could lawfully go.

Whatsoever is set before you, eat - Do not act as the Jews generally do,
torturing both themselves and others with questions, such as those
mentioned in [Co1 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#026.md).

[1 Corinthians 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">co1 10:28</span></span>

This is offered in sacrifice unto idols - While they were not apprized
of this circumstance they might lawfully eat; but when told that the
flesh set before them had been offered to an idol, then they were not to
eat, for the sake of his weak conscience who pointed out the
circumstance. For the apostle still takes it for granted that even the
flesh offered in sacrifice to an idol might be eaten innocently at any
private table, as in that case they were no longer in danger of being
partakers with devils, as this was no idol festival.

For the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof - This whole
clause, which appears also in [Co1
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#026.md), is wanting here in ABCDEFGH,
several others, the Syriac, Erpen, Coptic, Sahidic, Ethiopic, Armenian,
Vulgate, Itala; and in several of the fathers. Griesbach has left it out
of the text: and Professor White says, "Certissime delendum;" it should
most undoubtedly be erased. It has scarcely any authority to support it.

[1 Corinthians 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">co1 10:29</span></span>

For why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience? etc. - Though
in the case of flesh offered to idols, and other matters connected with
idolatry, (on which it appears there was much of a tender conscience
among some of the Corinthians), it was necessary to sacrifice something
to an over-scrupulous conscience, yet the Gospel of Christ did not lay
any man under this general burthen, that he must do nothing at which any
weak brother might feel hurt or be stumbled; for the liberty of the
Gospel must not take for its rule the scrupulosity of any conscience;
for if a man, by grace - by the allowance or authority of the Gospel,
partake of any thing that God's bounty has sent, and which the Gospel
has not forbidden, and give thanks to God for the blessing, no man has
right or authority to condemn such a person. This seems to be the
meaning of these two verses; and they read a lesson of caution to rash
judges, and to those who are apt to take offense.

[1 Corinthians 10:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">co1 10:31</span></span>

Whether therefore ye eat, or drink - As no general rule can be laid down
in reference to the above particulars, there is one maxim of which no
Christian must lose sight - that whether he eats or drinks of this or
the other kind of aliments, or whatever else he may do, he must do it so
as to bring glory to God. This is a sufficient rule to regulate every
man's conscience and practice in all indifferent things, where there are
no express commands or prohibitions.

[1 Corinthians 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">co1 10:32</span></span>

Give none offense, etc. - Scrupulously avoid giving any cause of offense
either to the unconverted Jews or the unconverted Gentiles, so as to
prejudice them against Christianity: nor to the Church of God, made up
of converts from the above parties.

[1 Corinthians 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">co1 10:33</span></span>

Even as I please all men - Act as I do: forgetting myself, my own
interests, convenience, ease, and comfort, I labor for the welfare of
others; and particularly that they may be saved. How blessed and amiable
was the spirit and conduct of this holy man!

This chapter has already presented the serious reader with a variety of
maxims for his regulation. -

1\. As to his own private walk;

2\. His domestic duties; and

3\. His connection with the Church of God.

Let us review some of the principal parts.

1\. We should be on our guard against what are called little sins, and
all occasions and excitements to sin. Take heed what company you
frequent. One thing, apparently harmless, may lead by almost
imperceptible links to sins of the deepest dye. See the example in this
chapter:

1\. The people sat down to eat and to drink.

2\. They rose up to play, dance, and sing: and

3\. They committed fornication, and brought upon themselves swift
destruction.

2\. However conscious we may be of our own sincerity and uprightness, we
should ever distrust ourselves. God has made nothing independent of
himself; the soul has no principle of self-dependence either in itself
or its attainments: it is wise, powerful, and happy, only while it is
depending on infinite wisdom, unlimited power, and endless mercy.

3\. The Gentiles were in communion with demons by their idolatrous
services. In what communion are those who feed themselves without fear,
who eat with the glutton and drink with the drunkard? So they partake of
the Lord Jesus who are under the influence of pride, self-will, hatred,
censoriousness, etc., and who carry their self-importance and worldly
spirit even into the house and worship of God?

4\. A spirit of curiosity too much indulged may, in an irreligious man,
lead to covetousness and theft: in a godly man, to a troublesome and
unscriptural scrupulosity of conscience, productive of nothing but
uneasiness to itself, and disturbance to others. Simplicity of heart
saves from this, and is an excellent gift.

5\. In many actions we have a twofold rule - the testimony of God and
charity: and in many things charity is the best interpreter of the
testimony. The testimony often permits what charity forbids, because
circumstances in time, place, etc., may render a thing improper on one
occasion that might be proper on another.

6\. Pious Quesnel has well said: Every thing honors God when it is done
for his sake; every thing dishonors him when any ultimate end is
proposed beside his glory. It is an unchangeable principle of the
Christian morality that all comes from God by his love, and all should
be returned to him by ours. This rule we should keep inviolate.

7\. Though many of the advices given in this chapter appear to respect
the Corinthians alone, yet there is none of them that is not applicable
to Christians in general in certain circumstances. God has given no
portion of his word to any people or age exclusively; the whole is given
to the Church universal in all ages of the world. In reading this
epistle let us seriously consider what parts of it apply to ourselves;
and if we are disposed to appropriate its promises, let us act
conscientiously, and inquire how many of its reprehensions we may fairly
appropriate also.
