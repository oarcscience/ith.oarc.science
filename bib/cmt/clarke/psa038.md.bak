### [Psalms Chapter 38](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 38:0</span></span>

David prays God to have mercy upon him, and gives a most affecting
account of his miserable state, [Psa
38:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#001.md); complains of his being
forsaken by his friends, and cruelly persecuted by his enemies, [Psa
38:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#011.md); confesses his sin; and
earnestly implores help, [Psa
38:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#017.md).

The title in the Hebrew states this to be A Psalm of David, to bring to
remembrance. The Chaldee; "A Psalm of David for a good memorial to
Israel." The Vulgate, Septuagint, and Aethiopic: "A Psalm of David, for
a commemoration concerning the Sabbath." The Arabic: "A Psalm in which
mention is made of the Sabbath; besides, it is a thanksgiving and a
prophecy." Never was a title more misplaced or less expressive of the
contents. There is no mention of the Sabbath in it; there is no
thanksgiving in it, for it is deeply penitential; and I do not see that
it contains any prophecy. The Syriac: "A psalm of David, when they said
to the Philistine king, Achish, This is David, who killed Goliath; we
will not have him to go with us against Saul. Besides, it is a form of
confession for us." It does not appear that, out of all the titles, we
can gather the true intent of the Psalm.

Several conjectures have been made relative to the occasion on which
this Psalm was composed; and the most likely is, that it was in
reference to some severe affliction which David had after his illicit
commerce with Bath-sheba; but of what nature we are left to conjecture
from the third, fifth, and seventh verses. Whatever it was, he deeply
repents for it, asks pardon, and earnestly entreats support from God.

[Psalms 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 38:1</span></span>

O Lord, rebuke me not - He was sensible that he was suffering under the
displeasure of God; and he prays that the chastisement may be in mercy,
and not in judgment.

[Psalms 38:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 38:2</span></span>

Thine arrows stick fast in me - This no doubt, refers to the acute pains
which he endured; each appearing to his feeling as if an arrow were shot
into his body.

[Psalms 38:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 38:3</span></span>

No soundness in my flesh - This seems to refer to some disorder which so
affected the muscles as to produce sores and ulcers; and so affected his
bones as to leave him no peace nor rest. In short, he was completely and
thoroughtly diseased; and all this he attributes to his sin, either as
being its natural consequence, or as being inflicted by the Lord as a
punishment on its account.

[Psalms 38:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 38:4</span></span>

Mine iniquities are gone over mine head - He represents himself as one
sinking in deep waters, or as one oppressed by a burden to which his
strength was unequal.

[Psalms 38:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 38:5</span></span>

My wounds stink and are corrupt - Taking this in connection with the
rest of the Psalm, I do not see that we can understand the word in any
figurative or metaphorical way. I believe they refer to some disease
with which he was at this time afflicted; but whether the leprosy, the
small pox, or some other disorder that had attacked the whole system,
and showed its virulence on different parts of the outer surface, cannot
be absolutely determined.

Because of my foolishness - This may either signify sin as the cause of
his present affliction, or it may import an affliction which was the
consequence of that foolish levity which prefers the momentary
gratification of an irregular passion to health of body and peace of
mind.

[Psalms 38:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 38:6</span></span>

I am troubled - In mind. I am bowed down in body. I am altogether
afflicted, and full of distress.

[Psalms 38:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 38:7</span></span>

For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease - Or rather, a burning;
נקלה nikleh, from קלה kalah, to fry, scorch, etc., hence נקלה nikleh, a
burning, or strongly feverish disease.

There is no soundness in my flesh - All without and all within bears
evidence that the whole of my solids and fluids are corrupt.

[Psalms 38:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 38:8</span></span>

I am feeble and sore broken - I am so exhausted with my disease that I
feel as if on the brink of the grave, and unfit to appear before God;
therefore "have I roared for the disquietness of my heart."

That David describes a natural disease here cannot reasonably be
doubted; but what that disease was, who shall attempt to say? However,
this is evident, that whatever it was, he most deeply deplored the cause
of it; and as he worthily lamented it, so he found mercy at the hand of
God. It would be easy to show a disease of which what he here enumerates
are the very general symptoms; but I forbear, because in this I might
attribute to one what, perhaps, in Judea would be more especially
descriptive of another.

[Psalms 38:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 38:9</span></span>

Lord, all my desire is before thee - I long for nothing so much as thy
favor; and for this my heart is continually going out after thee.
Instead of אדני Adonai, Lord, several of Dr. Kennicott's MSS. have יהוה
Yehovah.

[Psalms 38:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 38:10</span></span>

My heart panteth - סחרחר secharchar, flutters, palpitates, through fear
and alarm.

My strength faileth - Not being able to take nourishment.

The light of mine eyes - is gone - I can scarcely discern any thing
through the general decay of my health and vigor, particularly affecting
my sight.

[Psalms 38:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 38:11</span></span>

My lovers - Those who professed much affection for me; my friends, רעי
reai, my companions, who never before left my company, stand aloof.

My kinsmen - קרובי kerobai, my neighbors, stand afar off. I am deserted
by all, and they stand off because of נגעי nigi, my plague. They
considered me as suffering under a Divine judgment; and, thinking me an
accursed being, they avoided me lest they should be infected by my
disease.

[Psalms 38:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 38:12</span></span>

They also that seek after my life - They act towards me as huntsmen
after their prey; they lay snares to take away my life. Perhaps this
means only that they wished for his death, and would have been glad to
have had it in their power to end his days. Others spoke all manner of
evil of him, and told falsities against him all the day long.

[Psalms 38:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 38:13</span></span>

But I, as a deaf man - I was conscious of my guilt, I could not
vindicate myself; and I was obliged in silence to bear their insults.

[Psalms 38:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 38:14</span></span>

No reproofs - תוכחות tochachoth, arguments or vindications; a forensic
term. I was as a man accused in open court, and I could make no defense.

[Psalms 38:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 38:15</span></span>

In thee, O Lord, do I hope - I have no helper but thee.

Thou wilt hear, O Lord my God - Thou art eternal in thy compassions, and
wilt hear the prayer of a penitent soul. In the printed copies of the
Hebrew text we have אדני אלהי Adonai Elohai, Lord my God; but, instead
of אדני Adonai, one hundred and two of Kennicott's and De Rossi's MSS.
read יהוה Yehovah. As this word is never pronounced by the Jews, and
they consider it dreadfully sacred, in reading, wherever it occurs, they
pronounce אדני Adonai; and we may well suppose that Jewish scribes, in
writing out copies of the sacred Scriptures, would as naturally write
Adonai for Yehovah, as they would in reading supply the former for the
latter.

[Psalms 38:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 38:16</span></span>

When my foot slippeth - They watched for my halting; and when my foot
slipped, they rejoiced that I had fallen into sin!

[Psalms 38:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 38:17</span></span>

For I am ready to halt - Literally, I am prepared to halt. So completely
infirm is my soul, that it is impossible for me to take one right step
in the way of righteousness, unless strengthened by thee.

[Psalms 38:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 38:18</span></span>

I will declare mine iniquity - I will confess it with the deepest
humiliation and self-abasement.

[Psalms 38:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 38:19</span></span>

But mine enemies are lively - Instead of חיים chaiyim, lively, I would
read חינם chinam, without cause; a change made by the half of one
letter, נ nun for a י yod. See the parallel places, [Psa
35:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#019) (note.md); [Psa
79:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#005) (note.md). See also the Preliminary
Dissertation to Dr. Lowth's Isaiah, p. 40: "But without cause my enemies
have strengthened themselves; and they who wrongfully hate me are
multiplied." Here the one member of the verse answers to the other.

[Psalms 38:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 38:20</span></span>

Because I follow the thing that good is - The translation is as bad as
the sentence is awkward. תחת רדפי טוב tachath rodpi tob, because I
follow goodness. There is a remarkable addition to this verse in the
Arabic: "They have rejected me, the beloved one, as an abominable dead
carcass; they have pierced my body with nails." I suppose the Arabic
translator meant to refer this to Christ.

None of the other Versions have any thing like this addition; only the
Ethiopic adds, "They rejected their brethren as an unclean carcass." St.
Ambrose says this reading was found in some Greek and Latin copies in
his time; and Theodoret has nearly the same reading with the Arabic: Και
απερῥιψαν με τον αγαπητον, ῳς νεκρον εβδελυγμενον· "And they cast me,
the beloved, out, as an abominable dead carcass." Whence this reading
came I cannot conjecture.

[Psalms 38:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 38:21</span></span>

Forsake me not, O Lord - Though all have forsaken me, do not thou.

Be not far from me - Though my friends keep aloof, be thou near to help
me.

[Psalms 38:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 38:22</span></span>

Make haste to help me - I am dying; save, Lord, or I perish. Whoever
carefuIly reads over this Psalm will see what a grievous and bitter
thing it is to sin against the Lord, and especially to sin after having
known his mercy, and after having escaped from the corruption that is in
the world. Reader, be on thy guard; a life of righteousness may be lost
by giving way to a moment's temptation, and a fair character sullied for
ever! Let him that most assuredly standeth take heed lest he fall.

'Tis but a grain of sweet that one can sow,

To reap a harvest of wide-wasting wo.
