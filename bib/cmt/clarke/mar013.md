### [Mark Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#001.md)

[Mark](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mar 13:0</span></span>

Jesus predicts the destruction of the temple, [Mar
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#001.md), [Mar
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#002.md). His disciples inquire when this
shall be, and what previous sign there shall be of this calamity, [Mar
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#003.md), [Mar
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#004.md); which questions he answers very
solemnly and minutely, vv. 5-27; illustrates the whole by a parable,
[Mar 13:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#028.md), [Mar
13:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#029.md); asserts the absolute certainty
of the events, [Mar 13:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#030.md), [Mar
13:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#031.md); shows that the precise minute
cannot be known by man, [Mar 13:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#032.md);
and inculcates the necessity of watchfulness and prayer, [Mar
13:33-37](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#033.md).

[Mark 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 13:1</span></span>

See what manner of stones - Josephus says, Ant. b. xv. chap. 11: "That
these stones were white and strong, Fifty feet long, Twenty-Four broad,
and Sixteen in thickness." If this account can be relied on, well might
the disciples be struck with wonder at such a superb edifice, and formed
by such immense stones! The principal contents of this chapter are
largely explained in the notes on Matt. 24, and to these the reader is
requested to refer.

[Mark 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mar 13:6</span></span>

Saying, I am - The Christ, is added by eight MSS., Coptic, Armenian,
Saxon, and four of the Itala.

[Mark 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mar 13:8</span></span>

The beginnings - For αρχαι, many MSS. and versions have αρχη, the
beginning, singular.

[Mark 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 13:9</span></span>

Councils - Συνεδρια, Sanhedrins. The grand Sanhedrin consisted of
seventy-two elders; six chosen out of each tribe; this was the national
council of state; and the small Sanhedrins, which were composed of
twenty-three counsellors.

Synagogues - Courts of justice for villages, etc., consisting of three
magistrates, chosen out of the principal directors of the synagogue in
that place.

Rulers - Or governors. The Roman deputies, such as Pontius Pilate, etc.

Kings - The tetrarchs of Judea and Galilee, who bore this name. See [Mar
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#027.md).

[Mark 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 13:10</span></span>

And the Gospel must first be published among all nations. - Many of the
Evangelistaria omit this verse. Its proper place seems to be after verse
the thirteenth.

[Mark 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 13:11</span></span>

Neither - premeditate - This is wanting in BDL, five others, Coptic,
Ethiopic, Vulgate, Itala. Griesbach leaves it doubtful. On this verse
see [Mat 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#019) (note.md).

[Mark 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 13:14</span></span>

Let him that readeth understand - What he readeth, is added by D, and
three of the Itala, perhaps needlessly.

[Mark 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 13:15</span></span>

House-top - See on [Mat 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#017) (note.md).

[Mark 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mar 13:20</span></span>

Had shortened those days - Because of his chosen, added by D, Armenian,
and five of the Itala. See [Mat 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#022.md).

[Mark 13:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mar 13:30</span></span>

This generation - Ἡ γενεα αὑτη, This very race of men. It is certain
that this word has two meanings in the Scriptures; that given in the
text, and that above. Generation signifies a period of a certain number
of years, sometimes more, sometimes less. In [Deu
1:35](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#035.md); [Deu
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#014.md), Moses uses the word to point out
a term of thirty-eight years, which was precisely the number in the
present case; for Jerusalem was destroyed about thirty-eight years after
our Lord delivered this prediction. But as there are other events in
this chapter, which certainly look beyond the destruction of Jerusalem,
and which were to take place before the Jews should cease to be a
distinct people, I should therefore prefer the translation given above.
See on [Mat 24:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#034) (note.md).

[Mark 13:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mar 13:32</span></span>

Neither the Son - This clause is not found either in Matthew or Luke;
and Ambrose says it was wanting in some Greek copies in his time. To me
it is utterly unaccountable, how Jesus, who knew so correctly all the
particulars which he here lays down, and which were to a jot and tittle
verified by the event - how he who knew that not one stone should be
left on another, should be ignorant of the day and hour when this should
be done, though Daniel, [Dan 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md),
etc., could fix the very year, not less than five hundred years before
it happened: how he in whom the fullness of the Godhead dwelt bodily,
and all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, should not know this
small matter, I cannot comprehend, but on this ground, that the Deity
which dwelt in the man Christ Jesus might, at one time, communicate less
of the knowledge of futurity to him than at another. However, I strongly
suspect that the clause was not originally in this Gospel. Its not being
found in the parallel places in the other evangelists is, in my opinion,
a strong presumption against it. But Dr. Macknight, and others, solve
this difficulty in the following manner. They suppose the verb οιδεν to
have the force of the Hebrew conjugation Hiphel, in which verbs are
taken in a causative, declarative, or permissive sense; and that it
means here, make known, or promulge, as it is to be understood in [Co1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#002.md). This intimates that this secret
was not to be made known, either by men or angels, no, not even by the
Son of man himself; but it should be made known by the Father only, in
the execution of the purposes of his justice. I am afraid this only cuts
the knot, but does not untie it.

[Mark 13:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mar 13:34</span></span>

Left his house - Οικιαν, family. Our blessed Lord and Master, when he
ascended to heaven, commanded his servants to be faithful and watchful.
This fidelity to which he exhorts his servants consists in doing every
thing well which is to be done, in the heart or in the family, according
to the full extent of the duty. The watchfulness consists in suffering
no stranger nor enemy to enter in by the senses, which are the gates of
the soul; in permitting nothing which belongs to the Master to go out
without his consent; and in carefully observing all commerce and
correspondence which the heart may have abroad in the world, to the
prejudice of the Master's service. See Quesnel.

[Mark 13:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mar 13:35</span></span>

Watch ye therefore - The more the master is expected, the more diligent
ought the servants to be in working, watching, and keeping themselves in
readiness. Can one who has received the sentence of his death, and has
no right to live a moment, need any admonition to prepare to die? Does
not a prisoner who expects his deliverance, hold himself in continual
readiness to leave his dungeon?

[Mark 13:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mar 13:36</span></span>

He find you sleeping - A porter asleep exposes the house to be robbed,
and well deserves punishment. No wonder that the man is constantly
suffering loss who is frequently off his guard.

Our Lord shows us in this parable:

1\. That himself, ascended to heaven, is the man gone from home.

2\. That believers collectively are his family.

3\. That his servants are those who are employed in the work of faith
and labor of love.

4\. That the porter represents the ministers of his Gospel, who should
continually watch for the safety and welfare of the whole flock.

5\. That every one has his own work - that which belongs to himself and
to none other, and for the accomplishment of which he receives
sufficient strength from his Lord.

6\. That these servants and porters shall give an account to their Lord,
how they have exercised themselves in their respective departments.

7\. And that as the master of the family will certainly come to require
this account at a time when men are not aware, therefore they should be
always watchful and faithful. And,

8\. That this is a duty incumbent on every soul of man, What I say unto
you, I say unto All, Watch! If, after all these warnings, the followers
of God be found careless, their misery and condemnation must be great.
