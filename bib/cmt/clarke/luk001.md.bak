### [Luke Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md)

The preface, or St. Luke's private epistle to Theophilus, [Luk
1:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md). The conception and birth of
John Baptist foretold by the angel Gabriel, [Luk
1:5-17](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#005.md). Zacharias doubts, [Luk
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#018.md). And the angel declares he shall
be dumb, till the accomplishment of the prediction, [Luk
1:19-25](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#019.md). Six months after the angel
Gabriel appears to the virgin Mary, and predicts the miraculous
conception and birth of Christ, [Luk
1:26-38](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#026.md). Mary visits her cousin
Elisabeth, [Luk 1:39-45](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#039.md). Mary's song
of exultation and praise, [Luk
1:46-56](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#046.md). John the Baptist is born,
[Luk 1:57-66](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#057.md). The prophetic song of
his father Zacharias, [Luk 1:67-79](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#067.md).
John is educated in the desert, [Luk
1:80](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#080.md).

[Luke 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 1:1</span></span>

Many have taken in hand - Great and remarkable characters have always
many biographers. So it appears it was with our Lord: but as most of
these accounts were inaccurate, recording as facts things which had not
happened; and through ignorance or design mistaking others, especially
in the place where St. Luke wrote; it seemed good to the Holy Spirit to
inspire this holy man with the most correct knowledge of the whole
history of our Lord's birth, preaching, miracles, sufferings, death,
resurrection, and ascension, that the sincere, upright followers of God
might have a sure foundation, on which they might safely build their
faith. See the note on [Luk 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#010.md).

Most surely believed among us - Facts confirmed by the fullest evidence
- των πεπληροφορημενων πραγματων. Every thing that had been done or said
by Jesus Christ was so public, so plain, and so accredited by thousands
of witnesses, who could have had no interest in supporting an imposture,
as to carry the fullest conviction, to the hearts of those who heard and
saw him, of the divinity of his doctrine, and the truth of his miracles.

[Luke 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 1:2</span></span>

Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were
eye-witnesses - Probably this alludes to the Gospels of Matthew and
Mark, which it is likely were written before St. Luke wrote his, and on
the models of which he professes to write his own; and απ' αρχης, from
the beginning, must mean, from the time that Christ first began to
proclaim the glad tidings of the kingdom; and αυτοπται, eye-witnesses,
must necessarily signify, those who had been with him from the
beginning, and consequently had the best opportunities of knowing the
truth of every fact.

Ministers of the word - Του λογου. Some suppose that our blessed Lord is
meant by this phrase; as ὁ Λογος, the Word or Logos, is his essential
character in [Joh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md), etc.; but it
does not appear that any of the inspired penmen ever use the word in
this sense except John himself; for here it certainly means the doctrine
of Christ; and in this sense λογος is frequently used both by the
evangelists and apostles.

[Luke 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 1:3</span></span>

Having had perfect understanding - Παρηκολουθηκοτι ανωθεν, Having
accurately traced up - entered into the very spirit of the work, and
examined every thing to the bottom; in consequence of which
investigation, I am completely convinced of the truth of the whole.
Though God gives his Holy Spirit to all them who ask him, yet this gift
was never designed to set aside the use of those faculties with which he
has already endued the soul, and which are as truly his gifts as the
Holy Spirit itself is. The nature of inspiration, in the case of St.
Luke, we at once discover: he set himself, by impartial inquiry and
diligent investigation, to find the whole truth, and to relate nothing
but the truth; and the Spirit of God presided over and directed his
inquiries, so that he discovered the whole truth, and was preserved from
every particle of error.

From the very first - Ανωθεν, from their origin. Some think ανωθεν
should, in this place, be translated from above; and that it refers to
the inspiration by which St. Luke wrote. I prefer our translation, or,
from the origin, which several good critics contend for, and which
meaning it has in some of the best Greek writers. See Kypke.

Theophilus - As the literal import of this word is friend of God, Θεου
φιλος, some have supposed that under this name Luke comprised all the
followers of Christ, to whom, as friends of God, he dedicated this
faithful history of the life, doctrine, death, and resurrection of our
Lord. But this interpretation appears to have little solidity in it;
for, if all the followers of Christ are addressed, why is the singular
number used? and what good end could there be accomplished by using a
feigned name? Besides, κρατιϚε, most excellent, could never be applied
in this way, for it evidently designates a particular person, and one
probably distinguished by his situation in life; though this does not
necessarily follow from the title, which was often given in the way of
friendship. Theophilus appears to have been some very reputable Greek or
Roman, who was one of St. Luke's disciples. The first four verses seem a
private epistle, sent by the evangelist with this history, which, having
been carefully preserved by Theophilus, was afterwards found and
published with this Gospel.

[Luke 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 1:4</span></span>

Wherein thou hast been instructed - Κατηχηθης - In which thou hast been
catechized. It appears that Theophilus had already received the first
elements of the Christian doctrine, but had not as yet been completely
grounded in them. That he might know the certainty of the things in
which he had been thus catechized, by having all the facts and their
proofs brought before him in order, the evangelist sent him this
faithful and Divinely inspired narrative. Those who content themselves
with that knowledge of the doctrines of Christ which they receive from
catechisms and schoolmasters, however important these elementary
instructions may be, are never likely to arrive at such a knowledge of
the truth as will make them wise unto salvation, or fortify them against
the attacks of infidelity and irreligion. Every man should labor to
acquire the most correct knowledge, and indubitable certainty, of those
doctrines on which he stakes his eternal salvation. Some suppose that
St. Luke refers here to the imperfect instruction which Theophilus had
received from the defective Gospels to which he refers in [Luk
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md).

[Luke 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 1:5</span></span>

In the days of Herod, the king - This was Herod, surnamed the Great, the
son of Antipater, an Idumean by birth, who had professed himself a
proselyte to the Jewish religion, but regarded no religion, farther than
it promoted his secular interests and ambition. Thus, for the first
time, the throne of Judah was filled by a person not of Jewish
extraction, who had been forced upon the people by the Roman government.
Hence it appears plain that the prophecy of Jacob, [Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md), was now fulfilled; for the
scepter had departed from Judah: and now was the time, according to
another prophecy, to look for the governor from Bethlehem, who should
rule and feed the people of Israel: [Mic
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001.md), [Mic
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002.md). See a large account of the family
of the Herods, in the note on [Mat 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#001.md)
(note). This was before Christ six years.

The course of Abiah - When the sacerdotal families grew very numerous,
so that all could not officiate together at the tabernacle, David
divided them into twenty-four classes, that they might minister by
turns, [Ch1 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#001.md), etc., each family
serving a whole week, [Kg2 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#007.md); [Ch2
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#008.md). Abiah was the eighth in the
order in which they had been originally established: [Ch1
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#010.md). These dates and persons are
particularly mentioned as a full confirmation of the truth of the facts
themselves; because any person, at the time this Gospel was written,
might have satisfied himself by applying to the family of John the
Baptist, the family of our Lord, or the surrounding neighbors. What a
full proof of the Gospel history! It was published immediately after the
time in which these facts took place; and among the very people,
thousands of whom had been eye-witnesses of them; and among those, too,
whose essential interest it was to have discredited them if they could;
and yet, in all that age, in which only they could have been
contradicted with advantage, no man ever arose to call them in question!
What an absolute proof was this that the thing was impossible; and that
the truth of the Gospel history was acknowledged by all who paid any
attention to the evidences it produced!

Of the daughters of Aaron - That is, she was of one of the sacerdotal
families. This shows that John was most nobly descended: his father was
a priest and his mother the daughter of a priest; and thus, both by
father and mother, he descended from the family of Amram, of whom came
Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, the most illustrious characters in the whole
Jewish history.

[Luke 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 1:6</span></span>

They were both righteous - Upright and holy in all their outward conduct
in civil life.

Before God - Possessing the spirit of the religion they professed;
exercising themselves constantly in the presence of their Maker, whose
eye, they knew, was upon all their conduct, and who examined all their
motives.

Walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless -
None being able to lay any evil to their charge. They were as exemplary
and conscientious in the discharge of their religious duties as they
were in the discharge of the offices of civil life. What a sacred pair!
they made their duty to God, to their neighbor, and to themselves, walk
constantly hand in hand. See the note on [Mat
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#015.md). Perhaps εντολαι, commandments,
may here mean the decalogue; and δικαιωματα, ordinances, the ceremonial
and judicial laws which were delivered after the decalogue: as all the
precepts delivered from [Exo 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#001.md) to
[Exo 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#001.md) are termed δικαιωματα,
judgments or ordinances.

[Luke 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 1:7</span></span>

Both were now well stricken in years - By the order of God, sterility
and old age both met in the person of Elisabeth, to render the birth of
a son (humanly speaking) impossible. This was an exact parallel to the
case of Sarah and Abraham, [Gen 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#030.md);
[Gen 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#017.md). Christ must (by the
miraculous power of God) be born of a virgin: whatever was connected
with, or referred to, his incarnation must be miraculous and impressive.
Isaac was his grand type, and therefore must be born miraculously -
contrary to the common course and rule of nature: Abraham was a hundred
years of age, Sarah was ninety, [Gen
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#017.md), and it had Ceased to be with
Sarah After The Manner Of Women, [Gen
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#011.md), and therefore, from her age and
state, the birth of a child must, according to nature, have been
impossible; and it was thus; that it might be miraculous. John the
Baptist was to be the forerunner of Christ; his birth, like that of
Isaac, must be miraculous, because, like the other, it was to be a
representation of the birth of Christ; therefore his parents were both
far advanced in years, and besides, Elisabeth was naturally barren. The
birth of these three extraordinary persons was announced nearly in the
same way. God himself foretells the birth of Isaac, [Gen
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#016.md). The angel of the Lord announces
the birth of John the Baptist, [Luk
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#013.md); and six months after, the angel
Gabriel, the same angel, proclaims to Mary the birth of Christ! Man is
naturally an inconsiderate and incredulous creature: he must have
extraordinary things to arrest and fix his attention; and he requires
well-attested miracles from God, to bespeak and confirm his faith. Every
person who has properly considered the nature of man must see that the
whole of natural religion, so termed, is little else than a disbelief of
all religion.

[Luke 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 1:8</span></span>

Before God - In the temple, where God used to manifest his presence,
though long before this time he had forsaken it; yet, on this important
occasion, the angel of his presence had visited it.

[Luke 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 1:9</span></span>

His lot was, etc. - We are informed in the Talmud, that it was the
custom of the priests to divide the different functions of the
sacerdotal office among themselves by lot: and, in this case, the
decision of the lot was, that Zacharias should at that time burn the
incense before the Lord, in the holy place.

[Luke 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 1:10</span></span>

The whole multitude - were praying - The incense was itself an emblem of
the prayers and praises of the people of God: see [Psa
141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002.md); [Rev
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#001.md). While, therefore, the rite is
performing by the priest, the people are employed in the thing
signified. Happy the people who attend to the spirit as well as the
letter of every divine institution! Incense was burnt twice a day in the
temple, in the morning and in the evening, [Exo
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#007.md), [Exo
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#008.md); but the evangelist does not
specify the time of the day in which this transaction took place. It was
probably in the morning.

[Luke 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 1:11</span></span>

There appeared - an angel of the Lord - There had been neither prophecy
nor angelic ministry vouchsafed to this people for about 400 years. But
now, as the Sun of righteousness is about to arise upon them, the
day-spring from on high visits them, that they may be prepared for that
kingdom of God which was at hand. Every circumstance here is worthy of
remark:

1\. That an angel should now appear, as such a favor had not been
granted for 400 years.

2\. The person to whom this angel was sent - one of the priests. The
sacerdotal office itself pointed out the Son of God till he came: by him
it was to be completed, and in him it was to be eternally established: -
Thou art a priest for ever, [Psa
110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004.md).

3\. The place in which the angel appeared - Jerusalem; out of which the
word of the Lord should go forth, [Isa
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003.md), and not at Hebron, in the hill
country of Judea, where Zacharias lived, [Luk
1:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#039.md), which was the ordinary residence
of the priests, [Jos 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#011.md), where
there could have been few witnesses of this interposition of God, and
the effects produced by it.

4\. The place where he was when the angel appeared to him - in the
temple, which was the place where God was to be sought; the place of his
residence, and a type of the human nature of the blessed Jesus, [Joh
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#021.md).

5\. The time in which this was done - the solemn hour of public prayer.
God has always promised to be present with those who call upon him. When
the people and the priest go hand in hand, and heart with heart, to the
house of God, the angel of his presence shall surely accompany them, and
God shall appear among them.

6\. The employment of Zacharias when the angel appeared - he was burning
incense, one of the most sacred and mysterious functions of the
Levitical priesthood, and which typified the intercession of Christ:
confer [Heb 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#025.md), with [Heb
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024.md).

7\. The long continued and publicly known dumbness of the priest, who
doubted the word thus miraculously sent to him from the Lord: a solemn
intimation of what God would do to all those who would not believe in
the Lord Jesus. Every mouth shall be stopped.

[Luke 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 1:12</span></span>

Zacharias - was troubled - Or, confounded at his sudden and unexpected
appearance; and fear fell upon him, lest this heavenly messenger were
come to denounce the judgments of God against a faithless and
disobedient people, who had too long and too well merited them.

[Luke 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 1:13</span></span>

Thy prayer is heard - This probably refers,

1st, to the frequent prayers which he had offered to God for a son; and

2dly, to those which he had offered for the deliverance and consolation
of Israel.

They are all heard - thou shalt have a son, and Israel shall be saved.
If fervent faithful prayers be not immediately answered, they should not
be considered as lost; all such are heard by the Lord, are registered in
heaven, and shall be answered in the most effectual way, and in the best
time. Answers to prayer are to be received by faith; but faith should
not only accompany prayer while offered on earth, but follow it all its
way to the throne of grace, and stay with it before the throne till
dismissed with its answer to the waiting soul.

Thou shalt call his name John - For the proper exposition of this name,
see on [Mar 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#004) (note.md).

[Luke 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 1:14</span></span>

Thou shalt have joy, etc. - ΕϚαι χαρα σοι, He will be joy and gladness
to thee. A child of prayer and faith is likely to be a source of comfort
to his parents. Were proper attention paid to this point, there would be
fewer disobedient children in the world; and the number of
broken-hearted parents would be lessened. But what can be expected from
the majority of matrimonial connections, connections begun without the
fear of God, and carried on without his love.

Many shall rejoice at his birth - He shall be the minister of God for
good to multitudes, who shall, through his preaching, be turned from the
error of their ways, and converted to God their Savior.

[Luke 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 1:15</span></span>

He shall be great in the sight of the Lord - That is, before Jesus
Christ, whose forerunner he shall be; or he shall be a truly great
person, for so this form of speech may imply.

Neither wine nor strong drink - Σικερα, i.e. all fermented liquors which
have the property of intoxicating, or producing drunkenness. The
original word σικερα, sikera, comes from the Hebrew, שכר shakar, to
inebriate. "Any inebriating liquor," says St. Jerome, (Epis. ad Nepot)."
is called sicera, whether made of corn, apples, honey, dates, or any
other fruits." One of the four prohibited liquors among the East Indian
Moslimans is called sikkir. "Sikkir is made by steeping fresh dates in
water till they take effect in sweetening it: this liquor is abominable
and unlawful." Hedaya, vol. iv. p. 158. Probably this is the very liquor
referred to in the text. In the Institutes of Menu it is said,
"Inebriating liquor may be considered as of three principal sorts: that
extracted from dregs of sugar, that extracted from bruised rice, and
that extracted from the flowers of the madhuca: as one, so are all; they
shall not be tasted by the chief of the twice-born." Chap. xi. Inst. 95.
Twice-born is used by the Brahmins in the same sense as being born again
is used by Christians. It signifies a spiritual regeneration. From this
word comes our English term cyder, or sider, a beverage made of the
fermented juice of apples. See the note on [Lev
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#009.md).

Shall be filled with the Holy Ghost - Shall be Divinely designated to
this particular office, and qualified for it, from his mother's womb -
from the instant of his birth. One MS., two versions, and four of the
primitive fathers read εν τῃ κοιλιᾳ, In the womb of his mother -
intimating that even before he should be born into the world the Holy
Spirit should be communicated to him. Did not this take place on the
salutation of the Virgin Mary? - and is not this what is intended, [Luk
1:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#044.md)? To be filled with the Holy
Ghost, implies having the soul influenced in all its powers, with the
illuminating, strengthening, and sanctifying energy of the Spirit.

[Luke 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 1:16</span></span>

Many of the children of Israel shall he turn - See this prediction
fulfilled, [Luk 3:10-18](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#010.md).

[Luke 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 1:17</span></span>

He shall go before him - Jesus Christ, in the spirit and power of
Elijah; he shall resemble Elijah in his retired and austere manner of
life, and in his zeal for the truth, reproving even princes for their
crimes; compare [Kg1 21:17-24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#017.md), with
[Mat 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#004.md). It was on these accounts
that the Prophet Malachi, [Mal 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#006.md),
had likened John to this prophet. See also [Isa
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003.md); and [Mal
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005.md), [Mal
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#006.md).

To turn the hearts of the fathers - Gross ignorance had taken place in
the hearts of the Jewish people; they needed a Divine instructer: John
is announced as such; by this preaching and manner of life, all classes
among the people should be taught the nature of their several places,
and the duties respectively incumbent upon them, See [Luk
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#010.md), etc. In these things the
greatness of John, mentioned [Luk
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#015.md), is pointed out, Nothing is truly
great but what is so in the sight of God. John's greatness arose:

1\. From the plenitude of God's Spirit which dwelt in him.

2\. From his continual self-denial, and taking up his cross.

3\. From his ardent zeal to make Christ known.

4\. From his fidelity and courage in rebuking vice.

5\. From the reformation which he was the instrument of effecting among
the people; reviving among them the spirit of the patriarchs, and
preparing their hearts to receive the Lord Jesus.

To turn the hearts of the fathers to their children. By a very
expressive figure of speech, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the rest of
the patriarchs, are represented here as having their hearts alienated
from the Jews, their children, because of their unbelief and
disobedience; but that the Baptist should so far succeed in converting
them to the Lord their God, that these holy men should again look upon
them with delight, and acknowledge them for their children. Some think
that by the children, the Gentiles are meant, and by the fathers, the
Jews.

The disobedient - Or unbelieving, απειθεις, the persons who would no
longer credit the predictions of the prophets, relative to the
manifestation of the Messiah. Unbelief and disobedience are so
intimately connected, that the same word in the sacred writings often
serves for both.

[Luke 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 1:18</span></span>

Whereby shall I know this? - All things are possible to God: no natural
impediment can have any power when God has declared he will accomplish
his purpose. He has a right to be believed on his own word alone; and it
is impious, when we are convinced that it is his word, to demand a sign
or pledge for its fulfillment.

[Luke 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 1:19</span></span>

I am Gabriel - This angel is mentioned, [Dan
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#016.md); [Dan
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#021.md). The original גבריאל is
exceedingly expressive: it is compounded of גבורה geburah, and אל el,
the might of the strong God. An angel with such a name was exceedingly
proper for the occasion; as it pointed out that all-prevalent power by
which the strong God could accomplish every purpose, and subdue all
things to himself.

That stand in the presence of God - This is in allusion to the case of
the prime minister of an eastern monarch, who alone has access to his
master at all times; and is therefore said, in the eastern phrase, to
see the presence, or to be in the presence. From the allusion we may
conceive the angel Gabriel to be in a state of high favor and trust
before God.

[Luke 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 1:20</span></span>

Thou shalt be dumb - Σιωπων silent; this translation is literal; the
angel immediately explains it, thou shalt not be able to speak. Dumbness
ordinarily proceeds from a natural imperfection or debility of the
organs of speech; in this case there was no natural weakness or
unfitness in those organs; but, for his rash and unbelieving speech,
silence is imposed upon him by the Lord, and he shall not be able to
break it, till the power that has silenced him gives him again the
permission to speak! Let those who are intemperate in the use of their
tongues behold here the severity and mercy of the Lord; nine months'
silence for one intemperate speech! Many, by giving way to the language
of unbelief, have lost the language of praise and thanksgiving for
months, if not years!

The people waited - The time spent in burning the incense was probably
about half an hour, during which there was a profound silence, as the
people stood without engaged in mental prayer. To this there is an
allusion in [Rev 8:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#001.md). Zacharias had
spent not only the time necessary for burning the incense, but also that
which the discourse between him and the angel took up.

They perceived that he had seen a vision - As the sanctuary was
separated from the court by a great veil, the people could not see what
passed, but they understood this from Zacharias himself, who, ην
διανευων, made signs, or nodded unto them to that purpose. Signs are the
only means by which a dumb man can convey his ideas to others.

As soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished - Each family
of the priesthood officiated one whole week, [Kg2
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#017.md).

There is something very instructive in the conduct of this priest; had
he not loved the service he was engaged in, he might have made the loss
of his speech a pretext for immediately quitting it. But as he was not
thereby disabled from fulfilling the sacerdotal function, so he saw he
was bound to continue till his ministry was ended; or till God had given
him a positive dismission. Preachers who give up their labor in the
vineyard because of some trifling bodily disorder by which they are
afflicted, or through some inconvenience in outward circumstances, which
the follower of a cross-bearing, crucified Lord should not mention, show
that they either never had a proper concern for the honor of their
Master or for the salvation of men, or else that they have lost the
spirit of their Master, and the spirit of their work. Again, Zacharias
did not hasten to his house to tell his wife the good news that he had
received from heaven, in which she was certainly very much interested:
the angel had promised that all his words should be fulfilled in their
season, and for this season he patiently waited in the path of duty. He
had engaged in the work of the Lord, and must pay no attention to any
thing that was likely to mar or interrupt his religious service.
Preachers who profess to be called of God to labor in the word and
doctrine, and who abandon their work for filthy lucre's sake, are the
most contemptible of mortals, and traitors to their God.

Hid herself five months - That she might have the fullest proof of the

To take away my reproach - As fruitfulness was a part of the promise of
God to his people, [Gen 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#006.md), and
children, on this account, being considered as a particular blessing
from heaven, [Exo 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020.md); [Lev
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#009.md) : [Psa
127:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#003.md); so barrenness was considered
among the Jews as a reproach, and a token of the disapprobation of the
Lord. [Sa1 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#006.md). But see [Luk

A city of Galilee - As Joseph and Mary were both of the family of David,
the patrimonial estate of which lay in Bethlehem, it seems as if the
family residence should have been in that city, and not in Nazareth; for
we find that, even after the return from the captivity, the several
families went to reside in those cities to which they originally
belonged. See [Neh 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#003.md). But it is
probable that the holy family removed to Galilee for fear of exciting
the jealousy of Herod, who had usurped that throne to which they had an
indisputable right. See on [Luk 2:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#039.md)
(note). Thus, by keeping out of the way, they avoided the effects of his
jealousy.

father Quesnel on this subject are worthy of serious regard. At length
the moment is come which is to give a son to a virgin, a saviour to the
world, a pattern to mankind, a sacrifice to sinners, a temple to the
Divinity, and a new principle to the new world. This angel is sent from
God, not to the palaces of the great, but to a poor maid, the wife of a
carpenter. The Son of God comes to humble the proud, and to honor
poverty, weakness, and contempt. He chooses an obscure place for the
mystery which is most glorious to his humanity, its union with the
Divinity, and for that which is most degrading (his sufferings and
death) he will choose the greatest city! How far are men from such a
conduct as this!

And the angel came in unto her - Some think that all this business was
transacted in a vision; and that there was no personal appearance of the
angel. When Divine visions were given, they are announced as such, in
the sacred writings; nor can we with safety attribute any thing to a
vision, where a Divine communication is made, unless it be specified as
such in the text.

Hail - Analogous to, Peace be to thee - May thou enjoy all possible
blessings!

Highly favored - As being chosen in preference to all the women upon
earth, to be the mother of the Messiah. Not the mother of God, for that
is blasphemy.

He shall be great - Behold the greatness of the man Christ Jesus:

1st. Because that human nature that should be born of the virgin was to
be united with the Divine nature.

2dly. In consequence of this, that human nature should be called in a
peculiar sense the Son of the most high God; because God would produce
it in her womb without the intervention of man.

3rdly. He shall be the everlasting Head and Sovereign of his Church.

4thly. His government and kingdom shall be eternal.

Revolutions may destroy the kingdoms of the earth, but the powers and
gates of hell and death shall never be able to destroy or injure the
kingdom of Christ. His is the only dominion that shall never have an
end. The angel seems here to refer to [Isa

Seeing I know not a man - Or, husband. As she was only contracted to

accordingly.

[Luke 1:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">luk 1:35</span></span>

The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee - This conception shall take place
suddenly, and the Holy Spirit himself shall be the grand operator. The
power, δυναμις, the miracle-working power, of the Most High shall
overshadow thee, to accomplish this purpose, and to protect thee from
danger. As there is a plain allusion to the Spirit of God brooding over
the face of the waters, to render them prolific, [Gen
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002.md), I am the more firmly established
in the opinion advanced on [Mat 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#020.md),
that the rudiments of the human nature of Christ was a real creation in
the womb of the virgin, by the energy of the Spirit of God.

Therefore also that holy thing (or person) - shall be called the Son of
God - We may plainly perceive here, that the angel does not give the
appellation of Son of God to the Divine nature of Christ; but to that
holy person or thing, το ἁγιον, which was to be born of the virgin, by
the energy of the Holy Spirit. The Divine nature could not be born of
the virgin; the human nature was born of her. The Divine nature had no
beginning; it was God manifested in the flesh, [Ti1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016.md); it was that Word which being in
the beginning (from eternity) with God, [Joh
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#002.md), was afterwards made flesh,
(became manifest in human nature), and tabernacled among us, [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md). Of this Divine nature the angel
does not particularly speak here, but of the tabernacle or shrine which
God was now preparing for it, viz. the holy thing that was to be born of
the virgin. Two natures must ever be distinguished in Christ: the human
nature, in reference to which he is the Son of God and inferior to him,
[Mar 13:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#032.md); [Joh
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#019.md); [Joh
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#028.md), and the Divine nature which was
from eternity, and equal to God, [Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md); [Joh
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#030.md); [Rom
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#005.md); [Col
1:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016.md). It is true, that to Jesus the
Christ, as he appeared among men, every characteristic of the Divine
nature is sometimes attributed, without appearing to make any
distinction between the Divine and human natures; but is there any part
of the Scriptures in which it is plainly said that the Divine nature of
Jesus was the Son of God? Here, I trust, I may be permitted to say, with
all due respect for those who differ from me, that the doctrine of the
eternal Sonship of Christ is, in my opinion, anti-scriptural, and highly
dangerous. This doctrine I reject for the following reasons: -

1st. I have not been able to find any express declaration in the
Scriptures concerning it.

2dly. If Christ be the Son of God as to his Divine nature, then he
cannot be eternal; for son implies a father; and father implies, in
reference to son, precedency in time, if not in nature too. Father and
son imply the idea of generation; and generation implies a time in which
it was effected, and time also antecedent to such generation.

3dly. If Christ be the Son of God, as to his Divine nature, then the
Father is of necessity prior, consequently superior to him.

4thly. Again, if this Divine nature were begotten of the Father, then it
must be in time; i.e. there was a period in which it did not exist, and
a period when it began to exist. This destroys the eternity of our
blessed Lord, and robs him at once of his Godhead.

5thly. To say that he was begotten from all eternity, is, in my opinion,
absurd; and the phrase eternal Son is a positive self-contradiction.
Eternity is that which has had no beginning, nor stands in any reference
to Time. Son supposes time, generation, and father; and time also
antecedent to such generation. Therefore the conjunction of these two
terms, Son and eternity is absolutely impossible, as they imply
essentially different and opposite ideas.

The enemies of Christ's Divinity have, in all ages, availed themselves
of this incautious method of treating this subject, and on this ground,
have ever had the advantage of the defenders of the Godhead of Christ.
This doctrine of the eternal Sonship destroys the deity of Christ; now,
if his deity be taken away, the whole Gospel scheme of redemption is
ruined. On this ground, the atonement of Christ cannot have been of
infinite merit, and consequently could not purchase pardon for the
offenses of mankind, nor give any right to, or possession of, an eternal
glory. The very use of this phrase is both absurd and dangerous;
therefore let all those who value Jesus and their salvation abide by the
Scriptures. This doctrine of the eternal Sonship, as it has been lately
explained in many a pamphlet, and many a paper in magazines, I must and
do consider as an awful heresy, and mere sheer Arianism; which, in many
cases, has terminated in Socinianism, and that in Deism. From such
heterodoxies, and their abetters, may God save his Church! Amen!

Thy cousin Elisabeth - Thy kinswoman, συγγενης. As Elisabeth was of the
tribe of Levi, [Luk 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#005.md), and Mary of
the tribe of Judah, they could not be relatives but by the mother's
side.

She hath also conceived - And this is wrought by the same power and
energy through which thou shalt conceive. Thus God has given thee a
proof and pledge, in what he has done for Elisabeth, of what he will do
for thyself; therefore, have faith in God.

Who was called barren - It is probable that Elisabeth got this
appellative by way of reproach; or to distinguish her from some other
Elisabeth also well known, who had been blessed with children. Perhaps
this is the reproach which Elisabeth speaks of, [Luk
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#025.md), her common name among men, among
the people who knew her, being Elisabeth the barren.

For with God nothing shall be impossible - Words of the very same import
with those spoken by the Lord to Sarah, when he foretold the birth of
Isaac, [Gen 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#014.md), Is any thing too
hard for the Lord? As there can be no doubt that Mary perceived this
allusion to the promise and birth of Isaac, so she must have had her
faith considerably strengthened by reflecting on the intervention of God
in that case.

this act of faith, and purposed obedience, the conception of the
immaculate humanity of Jesus took place; and it was Done unto her
according to his word. See [Luk 1:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#035.md).

Blessed is she that believed; for there shall be, etc. - Or, Blessed is
she who hath believed that there shall be, etc. This I believe to be the
proper arrangement of the passage, and is thus noticed in the marginal
reading. Faith is here represented as the foundation of true happiness,
because it receives the fulfillment of God's promises. Whatever God has
promised, he intends to perform. We should believe whatever he has
spoken - his own authority is a sufficient reason why we should believe.
Let us only be convinced that God has given the promise, and then
implicit faith becomes an indispensable duty: in this case not to
believe implicitly would be absurd and unreasonable - God will perform
his promise, for He cannot lie.

And Mary said - Two copies of the Itala, and some books mentioned by
Origen, give this song to Elisabeth. It is a counterpart of the song of
Hannah, as related in [Sa1 2:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#001.md).

This is allowed by many to be the first piece of poetry in the New
Testament; but the address of the angel to Zacharias, [Luk
1:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#013.md), is delivered in the same way;
so is that to the virgin, [Luk
1:30-33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#030.md), and so also is Elisabeth's
answer to Mary, [Luk 1:42-45](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#042.md). All
these portions are easily reducible to the hemistich form in which the
Hebrew poetry of the Old Testament is found in many MSS., and in which
Dr. Kennicott has arranged the Psalms, and other poetical parts of the
Sacred Writings. See his Hebrew Bible.

My soul doth magnify the Lord - The verb μεγαλυνειν, Kypke has proved,
signifies to celebrate with words, to extol with praises. This is the
only way in which God can be magnified, or made great; for, strictly
speaking, nothing can be added to God, for he is infinite and eternal;
therefore the way to magnify him is to show forth and celebrate those
acts in which he has manifested his greatness.

alone she wished to be known; viz. The blessed or happy virgin. What
dishonor do those do to this holy woman, who give her names and
characters which her pure soul would abhor; and which properly belong to
God her Savior! By her votaries she is addressed as Queen of Heaven,
Mother of God, etc., titles both absurd and blasphemous.

As God fills her with his goodness, she empties herself to him in

itself in acts of mercy to all those who fear or reverence his name; and
this is continued from generation to generation, because he is abundant

becoming, and just character of the God of the Christians; a being who
delights in the salvation and happiness of all his creatures, because
his name is mercy, and his nature love.

With his arm - Grotius has well observed, that God's efficacy is
represented by his finger, his great power by his hand, and his
omnipotence by his arm. The plague of lice was the finger of God, [Exo

wrought by his hand, [Exo 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#020.md), And
the destruction of Pharaoh's host in the Red Sea, which was effected by
the omnipotence of God, is called the act of his arm, [Exo

He hath scattered - Διεσκορπισεν, hath scattered abroad; as a whirlwind

The proud - Or haughty, ὑπερηφανους; from ὑπερ above, and φαινω I show -
the haughty men, who wish to be noticed in preference to all others, and
feel sovereign contempt for all but themselves. These God scatters
abroad - instead of being in his sight, as in their own, the most
excellent of the earth, he treats them as straw, stubble, chaff, and
dust.

In the imagination of their hearts - While they are forming their
insolent, proud, and oppressive projects - laying their plans, and
imagining that accomplishment and success are waiting at their right
hand, the whirlwind of God's displeasure blows, and they and their
machinations are dissipated together.

potentates from their thrones. This probably alludes to the removal of
Saul from the throne of Israel, and the establishment of the kingdom in

saying may also allude to the destruction of the kingdom of Satan and

Filled the hungry - the rich he hath sent empty away - God is here
represented under the notion of a person of unbounded benevolence, who
is daily feeding multitudes at his gates. The poor and the rich are
equally dependent upon him; to the one he gives his affluence for a
season, and to the other his daily bread. The poor man comes through a
sense of his want to get his daily support, and God feeds him; the rich
man comes through the lust of gain, to get more added to his abundance,
and, God sends him empty away - not only gives him nothing more, but
often deprives him of that which he has, because he has not improved it
to the honor of the giver. There is an allusion here, as in several
other parts of this song, to the case of Hannah and Peninah, as related
[Sa1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#002.md), etc.; [Sa1
2:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#001.md).

[Luke 1:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#054.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">luk 1:54</span></span>

He hath holpen \[supported, αντελαβετο\] his servant Israel - Israel is
here represented as falling, and the Lord comes speedily in and props
him up. The house of David was now ready to fall and rise no more;
Jesus, being born of the very last branch of the regal line, revived the
family, and restored the dominion.

In remembrance of his mercy - By mercy, the covenant which God made with
Abraham, [Gen 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018.md), is intended;
which covenant proceeded from God's eternal mercy, as in it salvation
was promised to all the nations of the earth. See [Gen
17:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#019.md), and [Gen
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#018.md), and this promise was, in one
form or other, given to all the fathers, [Luk
1:55](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#055.md).

This song properly consists of three parts.

1\. In the first part Mary praises God for what he had done for herself,
[Luk 1:46-50](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#046.md).

2\. In the second, she praises him for what he had done, and would do,
against the oppressors of his people, [Luk
1:51-53](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#051.md).

3\. In the third, she praises him for what he had done, and would do,
for his Church, [Luk 1:53-56](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#053.md).

[Luke 1:56](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#056.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">luk 1:56</span></span>

And Mary abode with her about three months - According to some, the
departure of Mary from Hebron must have been but a few days before the
birth of John; as nine months had now elapsed since Elisabeth's
conception; see [Luk 1:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#036.md). Hence it
immediately follows: -

[Luke 1:57](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#057.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">luk 1:57</span></span>

Now Elisabeth's full time came, etc. - But, according to others, we are
to understand the three months of Mary's visit as preceding the birth of
John, which would complete the time of Elisabeth's pregnancy, according
to [Luk 1:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#036.md), and the only difficulty
is to ascertain whether Mary went immediately to Hebron after her
salutation, or whether she tarried nearly three months before she took
the journey.

[Luke 1:58](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#058.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">luk 1:58</span></span>

And her neighbors and her cousins - rejoiced with her. - Because
sterility was a reproach; and they now rejoiced with their relative,
from whom that reproach was now rolled away. To rejoice with those whom
God has favored, and to congratulate them on the advantages which he has
granted to them, is a duty which humanity, charity, and religion call
upon us to fulfill.

1\. It is a duty of humanity, which should be punctually performed. We
are all members of each other, and should rejoice in the welfare of the
whole. He who rejoices in his neighbor's prosperity increases his
neighbor's happiness, and gets an addition to his own.

2\. It is a duty which charity or brotherly love requires us to perform
with sincerity. In the polite world, there is no duty better fulfilled
in word than this is; but sincerity is utterly banished, and the giver
and receiver are both convinced that compliments and good wishes mean -
nothing. He who does not endeavor to take a sincere part in his
neighbor's prosperity will soon feel ample punishment in the spirit of
jealousy and envy.

3\. It is a duty of religion, which should be fulfilled with piety.
These neighbors and relatives saw that God had magnified his mercy
towards Elisabeth, and they acknowledged his hand in the work. God is
the dispenser of all good - he distributes his favors in mercy,
judgment, and justice. Let us honor him in his gifts; and honor those,
for his sake, who are objects of his favor. The society of believers are
but one body; the talents, etc., of every individual are profitable to
the whole community; at least none ate deprived of a share in the
general welfare, but those who, through jealousy or envy, refuse to
rejoice with him towards whom God hath magnified his mercy.

[Luke 1:59](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#059.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_059">luk 1:59</span></span>

On the eighth day they came to circumcise - See an account of this
institution in the note on [Gen
17:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#010) (note.md). Had circumcision been
essential to an infant's salvation, God would not have ordered it to be
delayed to the eighth day, because, in all countries, multitudes die
before they arrive at that age. Baptism, which is generally allowed to
have been substituted for circumcision, is no more necessary to the
salvation of an infant than circumcision was. Both are signs of the
covenant - circumcision, of the putting away the impurity of the flesh;
and baptism, of the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy
Ghost, producing the answer of a good conscience towards God. Confer
[Pe1 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#021.md), with [Tit
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005.md). This should never be neglected:
it is a sign and token of the spiritual grace.

They called him Zacharias - Among the Jews, the child was named when it
was circumcised, and ordinarily the name of the father was given to the
first-born son.

[Luke 1:60](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#060.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_060">luk 1:60</span></span>

Not so; but he shall be called John - This is the name which the angel
desired should be given him, [Luk
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#013.md), and of which Zacharias by
writing had informed his wife. There is something very remarkable in the
names of this family. Zachariah, זכריהו the memory or memorial of
Jehovah; יהו yeho, at the end of the word, being contracted for יהוה
Yehovah, as in many other names. Elisabeth, אליסבה the Sabbath or rest
of my strong God: names probably given them by their parents, to point
out some remarkable circumstance in their conception or birth. And John,
which should always be written Jehochanan or Yehochanan, יהוחנן the
grace or mercy of Jehovah: so named, because he was to go before and
proclaim the God of all grace, and the mercy granted through him to a
lost world. See [Joh 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029.md); see also
[Luk 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#016.md), and [Mar
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#004.md).

[Luke 1:61](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#061.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_061">luk 1:61</span></span>

None of thy kindred - As the Jewish tribes and families were kept
sacredly distinct, it appears the very names of the ancestors were
continued among their descendants, partly through reverence for them,
and partly to avoid confusion in the genealogical tables, which, for the
sake of distinguishing the inheritances, were carefully preserved in
each of the families. It seems to be on this account that the neighbors
and relatives objected to a name which had not before existed in any
branch of the family.

[Luke 1:62](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#062.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_062">luk 1:62</span></span>

They made signs to his father - Who, it appears from this, was deaf as
well as dumb; otherwise they might have asked him, and obtained his
answer in this way.

[Luke 1:63](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#063.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_063">luk 1:63</span></span>

A writing table - Πινακιδιον, a tablet, a diminutive of πιναξ, a table.
"The boys in Barbary are taught to write upon a smooth thin board,
slightly daubed over with whiting, which may be rubbed off or renewed at
pleasure. Such probably (for the Jewish children use the same) was the
little board, or writing table, as we render it [Luk
1:63](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#063.md), that was called for by
Zacharias." Shaw's Travels, p. 194. My old MS. considers the word as
meaning the instrument of writing, rather than the tablet on which he
wrote: and he aringe a poyntel, wroot seyinge, Joon is his name.

A thin board, made out of the pine tree, smeared over with wax, was used
among the ancients; and to this the Anglo-Saxon version seems to refer,
as it translates πινακιδιον, a wax board or cloth.

An intelligent friend has suggested a different mode of reading the 62nd
and 63rd verses: [Luk 1:62](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#062.md). And they
asked his father how he would have him called? [Luk
1:63](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#063.md). And he made signs for a writing
table and wrote, His name is John: "For," says my friend, "the 64th
verse proves his mouth was not opened, neither his tongue loosed, till
after the child was named; therefore he could not ask for the table; and
it is more reasonable that he, being dumb, should make signs, than that
those should who had the use of their tongues." But, howsoever ingenious
this may be, neither the words of the Greek text, nor their
construction, will bear this version.

[Luke 1:64](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#064.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_064">luk 1:64</span></span>

The latter clause of the preceding verse should be joined with the
beginning of this, as follows: And they marveled all, for his mouth was
opened, etc. Every person must see the propriety of putting this clause,
And they marveled all, to the beginning of the 64th verse, instead of
leaving it at the end of the 63rd, as in the common version. The people
did not wonder because Zacharias said, He shall be called John; but
because he himself was that instant restored to the use of his speech.

And he spake, and praised God - In his nine months' silence, he had
learned the proper use of his tongue; and God, whose power was
discredited by it, is now magnified. Happy they who, in religious
matters, only break silence in order to speak of the loving-kindness of
the Lord!

[Luke 1:65](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#065.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_065">luk 1:65</span></span>

And fear came - Seeing what they might have thought a paralytic
affection so suddenly and effectually healed. Φοβος - This word
certainly means in several places, religious fear or reverence; and in
this sense it is used [Act 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#031.md); [Rom
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#018.md); [Rom
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#007.md); [Pe1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#017.md); [Pe1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#018.md); [Pe1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#002.md). The meaning of it here is plainly
this: The inhabitants of Hebron and its environs, who were well
acquainted with the circumstances of Zacharias and Elisabeth, perceived
that God had in a remarkable manner visited them; and this begot in
their minds a more than ordinary reverence for the Supreme Being. Thus
the salvation of one often becomes an instrument of good to the souls of
many. The inhabitants of this hill country seem to have been an open,
honest-hearted, generous people; who were easily led to acknowledge the
interposition of God, and to rejoice in the comfort and welfare of each
other. The people of the country are more remarkable for these qualities
than those in towns and cities. The latter, through that evil
communication which corrupts good manners, are generally profligate,
selfish, regardless of God, and inattentive to the operation of his
hands.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_066">luk 1:66</span></span>

What manner of child shall this be! - As there have been so many
extraordinary things in his conception and birth, surely God has
designed him for some extraordinary purpose. These things they laid up
in their heart, patiently waiting to see what God would work.

The hand of the Lord was with him - God defended and prospered him in
all things, and the prophetic spirit began to rest upon him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_067">luk 1:67</span></span>

Zacharias - prophesied - The word prophesy is to be taken here in its
proper acceptation, for the predicting or foretelling future events.

Zacharias speaks, not only of what God had already done, but also of
what he was about to do, in order to save a lost world.

[Luke 1:68](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#068.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_068">luk 1:68</span></span>

Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for, etc. - Zacharias praises God for
two grand benefits which he had granted to his people. 1. He has visited
them. 2. He has ransomed them.

1\. He speaks by the spirit of prophecy, which calls things that are
not, as though they were; because they are absolutely determined by the
Most High, and shall be all fulfilled in their season. God visits his
people in the incarnation of Jesus Christ; therefore this Christ is
called by him, Κυριος ὁ Θεος, Jehovah the God of Israel. Here the
highest and most glorious character of the Supreme Being is given to
Christ.

2\. This God redeems his people: it is for this end that he visits them.
His soul is about to be made a sacrifice for sin: he becomes flesh, that
he may suffer and die for the sin of the world. God, by taking upon him
the nature of man, has redeemed that nature from eternal ruin.

He hath - redeemed - Εποιησε λυτρωσιν, he hath made a ransom - laid down
the ransom price. Λυτροω signifies particularly to ransom a captive from
the enemy, by paying a price. The following remarkable passage from
Josephus, Ant. b. xiv. c. 14, sect. 1, fully illustrates this meaning of
the original. "Herod, not knowing what had happened to his brother,
hastened λυτρωσασθαι, to ransom him from the enemy, and was willing to
pay λυτρον ὑπερ αυτου, a ransom for him, to the amount of three hundred
talents." Sinners are fallen into the hands of their enemies, and are
captives to sin and death. Jesus ransoms them by his own blood, and
restores them to life, liberty, and happiness. This truth the whole
Bible teaches: this truth God has shown in certain measures, even to
those nations who have not been favored with the light of his written
word: for Christ is that true light, which enlightens every man that
cometh into the world.

How astonishing is the following invocation of the Supreme Being,
(translated from the original Sanscreet by Dr. C. Wilkins), still
existing on a stone, in a cave near she ancient city of Gya, in the East
Indies!

"The Deity, who is the Lord, the possessor of all, appeared in this
ocean of natural beings, at the beginning of the Kalee Yoog (the age of
contention and baseness). He who is omnipresent and everlastingly to be
contemplated, the Supreme Being, the Eternal One, the Divinity worthy to
be adored - Appeared here with a Portion of his Divine Nature. Reverence
be unto thee in the form of (a) Bood-dha! Reverence be unto the Lord of
the earth! Reverence be unto thee, an Incarnation of the Deity, and the
Eternal One! Reverence be unto thee, O God, in the form of the God of
mercy; the dispeller of pain and trouble, the Lord of all things, the
Deity who overcometh the sins of the Kalee Yoog; the guardian of the
universe, the emblem of mercy toward those who serve thee - (b) O'M! the
possessor of all things in Vital Form! Thou art (c) Brahma, Veeshnoo,
and Mahesa! Thou art Lord of the universe! Thou art under the form of
all things, movable and immovable, the possessor of the whole! and thus
I adore thee. Reverence be unto the Bestower Of Salvation, and the Ruler
of the faculties! Reverence be unto thee, the Destroyer of the Evil
Spirit! O Damordara, (d) show me favor! I adore thee, who art celebrated
by a thousand names, and under various forms, in the shape of Bood-dha,
the God of Mercy! Be propitious, O Most High God!" - Asiatic Researches,
vol. i. pp. 284, 285.

\(a\) Bood-dha. The name of the Deity, as author of happiness.

\(b\) O'M. A mystic emblem of the Deity, forbidden to be pronounced but
in silence. It is a syllable formed of the Sanscreet letters a, o o,
which in composition coalesce, and make o, and the nasal consonant m.
The first letter stands for the Creator, the second for the Preserver
and the third for the Destroyer. It is the same among the Hindoos as
יהוה Yehovah is among the Hebrews.

\(c\) Brahma, the Deity in his creative quality. Veeshnoo, he who
filleth all space, the Deity in his preserving quality. Mahesa, the
Deity in his destroying quality. This is properly the Hindoo Trinity:
for these three names belong to the same Being. See the notes to the
Bhagvat Geeta.

\(d\) Damordara, or Darmadeve, the Indian God of Virtue.

[Luke 1:69](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#069.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_069">luk 1:69</span></span>

And hath raised up a horn of salvation - That is, a mighty and glorious
Savior: a quotation from [Psa 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002.md).
Horns are the well known emblems of strength, glory, and power, both in
the sacred and profane writers, because the strength and beauty of
horned animals consist in their horns. Horns have also been considered
as emblems of light; therefore the heathen god Apollo is represented
with horns, to point out the power, glory, and excellence of the solar
light. The Chaldee paraphrast sometimes translates קרן keren, horn, by
מלכות malcuth, or מלכותא malcutha, [Sa1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#010.md); [Jer
48:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#025.md), which signify a kingdom: but it
is likely that the allusion is here made to the horns of the altar; and
as the altar was a place of refuge and safety, and those who laid hold
on its horns were considered to be under the protection of the Lord, so,
according to the expression of Zacharias, Jesus Christ is a new altar,
to which whosoever flees shall find refuge.

Some imagine that this form of speech is taken from the custom of
ancient warriors, who had a horn of steel on the top of their helmets,
which ordinarily lay flat, till the person came victorious from battle,
and then it was erected, as emblematical of the victory gained. Such a
horn as this is represented on the helmet of the Abyssinian kings and
warriors: see the plates in Bruce's Travels. To this custom of wearing
or lifting up the horn, the following scriptures are thought to allude:
[Sa1 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#010.md); [Psa
112:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#009.md); [Psa
148:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#004.md); [Lam
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#017.md). In ancient gems and coins, this
form of the horn on helmets is easily discernible, sometimes flat,
sometimes erected. A horn, filled with various fruits, was also the
emblem of abundance among the ancients: hence their cornu copia, or horn
of plenty. From all this we may learn that the Lord Jesus gives a
luminous, powerful, prevalent, glorious, and abundant Salvation or
Refuge to mankind.

In the house of his servant David - Or, in the family: so the word
οικος, house, is often used in the Sacred Writings. In [Luk
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#032.md), the angel states that Mary was
of the family of David; and Zacharias, who, from the nature of his
office, must have been well acquainted with the public genealogical
tables, attests the same thing. This is a matter of considerable
importance; because it shows forth the truth of all the prophetic
declarations, which uniformly state that the Messiah should come from
the family and sit on the throne of David.

[Luke 1:71](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#071.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_071">luk 1:71</span></span>

That we should be saved (literally, a salvation) from our enemies - As
Zacharias spoke by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, the salvation
which he mentions here must necessarily be understood in a spiritual
sense. Satan, death, and sin are the enemies from whom Jesus came to
deliver us. Sin is the most dangerous of all, and is properly the only
enemy we have to fear. Satan is without us, and can have no power over
us, but what he gets through sin. Death is only in our flesh, and shall
be finally destroyed (as it affects us) on the morning of the
resurrection.

Jesus redeems from sin; this is the grand, the glorious, the important
victory. Let us get sin cast out, and then we need, fear neither death,
nor the devil.

[Luke 1:72](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#072.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_072">luk 1:72</span></span>

His holy covenant - See the note on [Luk
1:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#054.md).

[Luke 1:74](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#074.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_074">luk 1:74</span></span>

Being delivered, etc. - The salvation brought by Jesus Christ, consists
in the following things: -

1\. We are to be delivered out of the hand of our enemies, and from all
that hate us; so that sin shall neither have dominion over us, nor
existence in us.

2\. We are to worship God, λατρευειν, to render him that service and
adoration which the letter and spirit of his religion require.

3\. Ye are to live in holiness, a strict inward conformity to the mind
of Christ - and righteousness, a full outward conformity to the precepts
of the Gospel.

4\. This is to be done before God, under the continual influence and
support of his grace, and with a constant evidence of his presence and
approbation.

5\. This state is a state of true happiness - it is without fear. Sin is
all cast out, holiness is brought in; God's power upholds, and his
approbation cheers and comforts, the believing heart. Thus misery is
precluded, and happiness established.

6\. This blessedness is to continue as long as we exist - all the days
of our life, in all ages, in all situations, and in all circumstances.
What a pity to have lived so long without God in the world, when so much
happiness and glory are to be enjoyed in union with him!

Της ζωης, in the last clause, is omitted by many MSS., versions, and
fathers. Griesbach has left it out of the text: however, it is but of
small importance whether we read all our days, or, all the days of our
life.

[Luke 1:76](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#076.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_076">luk 1:76</span></span>

And thou, child, etc. - Zacharias proclaims the dignity, employment,
doctrine, and success of his son; and the ruin and recovery of the Jews
and the Gentiles.

1\. His dignity. Thou shalt be called (constituted) a prophet of the
Most High. Prophet has two acceptations: -

1st. A person who foretells future events; and;

2dly. A teacher of men in the things of God, [Co1
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#003.md).

John was a prophet in both senses: he proclaimed the mercy which should
be communicated; announced the baptism of the Holy Spirit; and taught
men how to leave their sins, and how to find the salvation of God. See
[Luk 3:5-14](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#005.md). His very name,
Jehochanan, the grace or mercy of Jehovah, (see [Luk
1:60](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#060).md), was a constant prediction of
the salvation of God. Our Lord terms him the greatest prophet which had
ever appeared in the world. He had the honor of being the last and
clearest prophet of the old covenant, and the first of the new.

2\. His employment. Thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare
his ways. He should be the immediate forerunner of Jesus Christ, none
being capable of succeeding him in his ministry but Christ himself. He
was to prepare his ways, to be the honored instrument, in the hands of
God, of disposing the hearts of multitudes of the Israelites to believe
in and follow the Lord Jesus.

3\. Zacharias points out the doctrine or teaching of John. It should be
γνωσις σωτηριας, the science of salvation. Men are ignorant, and they
must be instructed. Human sciences may be profitable in earthly matters,
but cannot profit the soul. The science that teaches God must come from
God. No science is of any avail to the soul that does not bring
salvation with it: this is the excellence of heavenly science, and an
excellence that is peculiar to itself. No science but that which comes
from God can ever save a soul from the power, the guilt, and the
pollution of sin.

4\. Zacharias predicts the success of his son's ministry. Under his
preaching, the people should be directed to that tender mercy of God,
through which they might obtain the remission of their sins, [Luk
1:77](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#077.md), [Luk
1:78](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#078.md). Those who are sent by God, and
preach his truth, and his only, shall always be successful in their
work; for it is for this very purpose that God has sent them; and it
would be a marvelous thing, indeed, should they labor in vain. But there
never was such a case, since God made man, in which a preacher was
Divinely commissioned to preach Jesus and his salvation, and yet had no
fruit of his labor.

5\. Zacharias points out the wretched state in which the inhabitants of
Judea and the Gentile world were then found.

1\. Their feet had wandered out of the way of peace, ([Luk
1:79](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#079).md), of temporal and spiritual
prosperity.

2\. They had got into a state of darkness - they were blind concerning
the things of God, and the things which belonged to their salvation.

3\. They had become contented inhabitants of this land of intellectual
darkness - they had sat down in it, and were not concerned to get out of
it.

4\. They were about to perish in it - death had his dominion there; and
his swift approaches to them were now manifested to the prophet by
seeing his shadow cast upon them.

Ignorance of God and salvation is the shadow of death; and the
substance, eternal ruin, is essentially connected with the projected
shadow. See these phrases explained at large on [Mat
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#016) (note.md).

6\. Zacharias proclaims the recovery of a lost world. As the removal of
this darkness, and redemption from this death, were now at hand, John is
represented as being a day-spring from on high, a morning star, that
foretold the speedy approach of the day, and the rising of the Sun of
righteousness. That these words should be applied to John, and not to
Christ, I am fully satisfied; and cannot give my reasons better for the
arrangement I have made in the preceding notes, than in the words of an
eminent critic, who, I find, has adopted nearly the same plan with
myself. The passage, as I read it, is as follows: Through the tender
mercy of our God, by which he hath visited us: a day-spring from on
high, to give light to them that sit in the darkness and in the shadow
of death, etc. "Let the reader judge, whether my arrangement of this
passage, which much better suits the original, be not far more elegant,
and in all respects superior to the old translation. Thou, child! wilt
be a teacher - Thou Wilt Be a day-spring from the sky. And with what
beauty and propriety is John, the forerunner of our Lord, styled the
dawn of day, that ushers in the rising of the Sun of righteousness! And
the concluding words - to guide our feet into the way of peace - is a
comprehensive clause, after the manner of Hebrew poetry, belonging
equally to the former sentence, beginning at - And thou, child! - and
the latter, beginning at - A day-spring from the sky: for the people
spoken of in the former are the Jews; and in the latter, the Gentiles."

The child grew - Increased in stature and bodily vigor. And waxed strong
in spirit - had his understanding Divinely illuminated and confirmed in
the truths of God. And was in the deserts - the city of Hebron, the
circumjacent hill country, and in or near Nazareth. Till the time of his
showing, or manifestation - till he was thirty years of age, before
which time the law did not permit a man to enter into the public
ministry, [Num 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#003.md). See also [Luk
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#023.md).

So much has already been said, by way of practical improvement of the
different subjects in this important chapter, as to preclude the
necessity of any addition here.
