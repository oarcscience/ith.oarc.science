### [Matthew Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#001.md)

[Matthew](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mat 28:0</span></span>

The resurrection of Christ declared by an angel to the two Marys at the
sepulchre, [Mat 28:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#001.md). They are
commissioned to announce this to the disciples, [Mat
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#007.md). They go, and are met by Christ
himself who promises to meet the disciples in Galilee, [Mat
28:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#008.md). The watch go into the city,
and report to the chief priests what had taken place, [Mat
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#011.md). They give them money, to say
that his disciples had stolen the body by night, while they slept, [Mat
28:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#012.md). Christ meets the eleven
disciples in a mountain of Galilee, [Mat
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#016.md), [Mat
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#017.md). He gives them a commission to
preach the Gospel throughout the earth; to baptize in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; and promises to be with
them to the end of the world, [Mat
28:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018.md).

[Matthew 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 28:1</span></span>

In the end of the Sabbath - Οψε δε σαββατων. After the end of the week:
this is the translation given by several eminent critics; and in this
way the word οψε is used by the most eminent Greek writers. Thucydides,
lib. iv. chap. 93, της ημερας οψε ην - the day was ended. Plutarch, οψε
των βασιλεως χρονων - after the times of the king. Philostratus οψε των
Τροικων - after the Trojan war. See Rosenmuller. In general the Jews
divided their natural day, which consisted of twenty-four hours, into
day and night. Their artificial day began at the rising and ended at the
setting of the sun; all the rest of the time, from the setting to the
rising of the sun, they termed night: hence the same word, in Hebrew,
signifies both evening and night. [Gen
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#005.md); [Mar
6:47](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#047.md). Matthew has employed the word in
this extensive sense here, pointing out the latter part of the Jewish
night, that which immediately preceded the rising of the sun, and not
that first part which we call the evening. The transaction mentioned
here evidently took place early on the morning of the third day after
our Lord's crucifixion; what is called our Sunday morning, or first day
of the next week.

Came - to see the sepulchre - That is, they set out at this time in
order to visit the tomb of our Lord, and also to weep there, [Joh
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#031.md), and to embalm the body of our
Lord, [Luk 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#001.md). St. Matthew omits
Mary Salome, mentioned by Mark; and Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's
steward, mentioned by Luke. The other Mary was the wife of Cleopas, and
mother of James and Joses, mentioned before, [Mat
27:56](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#056.md). Were not Mary and Salome two
distinct persons?

[Matthew 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 28:2</span></span>

A great earthquake - Σεισμος, a shaking or commotion of any kind:
probably the word means no more than the confusion caused among the
guards by the angel's appearance. All this had taken place before the
women reached the sepulchre.

The angel of the Lord descended from heaven - Matthew is very particular
in this, to show that the word angel is not to be taken in the sense of
an ordinary messenger, who might have come from Joseph of Arimathea, or
from any other; but in the sense of an extraordinary messenger, who
descended from God, out of heaven, for this very purpose. It is likely
that the angel had descended, rolled away the stone, and was sitting on
it, before the women reached the tomb.

[Matthew 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 28:3</span></span>

His countenance - His appearance, ἡ ιδεα αυτου; or, his face, for so the
word is used in some of the best Greek writers. It seems, from [Mar
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#005.md), that this angel had assumed the
appearance of a young man.

Like lightning - Coruscations of glory continually flaming from his
face. This might produce the confusion mentioned [Mat
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#002.md).

His raiment white as snow - He was clothed in garments emblematical of
the glad tidings which he came to announce. It would have been
inconsistent with the message he brought, had the angel appeared in
black robes, such as those preposterously wear who call themselves his
successors in the ministry of a once suffering, but now risen and highly
exalted, Savior. But the world is as full of nonsense as of sin; and who
can correct and bring it to reason and piety?

[Matthew 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 28:4</span></span>

The keepers - became as dead men - God can, by one and the same means,
comfort his servants, and terrify his enemies. The resurrection of
Christ is a subject of terror to the servants of sin, and a subject of
consolation to the sons of God; because it is a proof of the
resurrection of both, the one to shame and everlasting contempt - the
other to eternal glory and joy.

[Matthew 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 28:5</span></span>

I know that ye seek Jesus - Speaking after the manner of men, these
women deserved to be the first witnesses of the resurrection of Christ:
during life they ministered to him, and in death they were not divided.
They attended him to the Cross, notwithstanding their attachment to him
exposed them to the most imminent danger; and now they come to watch and
weep at his Tomb. The common opinion is, that women are more fickle and
less courageous than men. The reverse of this I believe to be the truth,
in those who are thoroughly converted to God; and who, previously to
conversion, whether man or woman, can be trusted in any case?

[Matthew 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 28:6</span></span>

Come, see the place - The tomb in which our Lord was laid was no doubt
like the rest of the Jewish burying places, a receptacle for the several
dead of a whole family, divided into separate niches, where each had his
place. Come and see the place - was tantamount to, Come and see the
niche in which he was laid - it is now empty; nor was there any other
body in the place, for the tomb was a new one, in which no man had ever
been laid, [Joh 19:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#041.md); so there could
be no deception in the case.

[Matthew 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 28:7</span></span>

Go quickly and tell his disciples - Thus these faithful women proclaim
the Gospel to those who were afterwards to be the teachers of the whole
human race! Behold what honor God puts upon those who persevere in his
truth, and continue to acknowledge him before men!

That he is risen from the dead - There is a remarkable saying of R.
Judah Hakkodesh, which some critics quote on this subject: "After Three
Days the Soul of the Messiah shall Return to its body, and he shall Go
Out of that Stone in which he shall be Buried."

Goeth before you into Galilee - As himself promised, [Mat
26:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#032.md).

[Matthew 28:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 28:8</span></span>

They departed quickly from the sepulchre - At the desire of the angel
they went into the tomb, to have the fullest certainty of the
resurrection.

Fear and great joy - Fear, produced by the appearance of this glorious
messenger of God; and great joy occasioned by the glad tidings of the
resurrection of their Lord and Master. At the mention of unexpected good
news, fear and joy are generally intermingled.

\- Vix sum apud me, ita animus commotus est metu,

Spe, gaudio, mirando hoc tanto, tam repentino bono

Terant. Andr. v. 945

"I am almost beside myself, my mind is so agitated with fear, hope, and
joy, at this unexpected good news."

[Matthew 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 28:9</span></span>

And as they went to tell his disciples - This clause is wanting in the
Codex Vatican, and Codex Bezae, and in twenty others, and in most of the
versions. The omission is approved by Mill, Bengel, and Schmid.
Griesbach leaves it in the text with a note of doubtfulness. It appears
to be superfluous. To connect this with the next clause, the particle
και, and, is obliged to be suppressed in all the translations. I think
the verse should begin with, And behold he goeth, etc., and the former
clause be suppressed. Probabiliter delenda, says Professor White, in his
Crisews Griesbachianae, speaking of the preceding words.

Jesus met them - Christ bestows his graces and consolations by degrees,
first by his angels, and then by himself. He does not reveal himself to
incredulous and disobedient souls; he appears not even to these women
till he has tried their faith and obedience by his ministering angels.

All hail - Anglo-Saxon, Health be to you! Χαιρετε, Be ye safe, rejoice.

And they held him by the feet, and worshipped him - This kind of
reverence is in daily use among the Hindoos: when a disciple meets his
religious guide in the public streets, he prostrates himself before him,
and, taking the dust from his teacher's feet, rubs it on his forehead,
breast, etc. See Ward's Customs.

[Matthew 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 28:10</span></span>

Be not afraid - They were seized with fear at the sight of the angel;
and this was now renewed by this unexpected appearance of Christ. See
the note on [Mat 28:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#008.md).

Go, tell my brethren - This is the first time our Lord called his
disciples by this endearing name: they no doubt thought that their Lord
would reproach them with their past cowardice and infidelity; but, in
speaking thus, he gives them a full assurance, in the most tender terms,
that all that was passed was as buried for ever.

[Matthew 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 28:11</span></span>

Some of the watch - Or guards. Probably the rest still remained at the
tomb, waiting for orders to depart, and had sent these to intimate to
their employers the things that had taken place.

[Matthew 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 28:12</span></span>

With the elders - That is, the senators of the great Sanhedrin or Jewish
council of state, elsewhere called the elders of the people; they could
now meet, as the Sabbath was over.

[Matthew 28:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 28:13</span></span>

His disciples came by night - This was as absurd as it was false. On one
hand, the terror of the disciples, the smallness of their number (only
eleven); and their almost total want of faith; on the other, the great
danger of such a bold enterprise, the number of armed men who guarded
the tomb, the authority of Pilate and of the Sanhedrin, must render such
an imposture as this utterly devoid of credit.

Stole him away while we slept - Here is a whole heap of absurdities.

1st. Is it likely that so many men would all fall asleep, in the open
air, at once?

2dly. Is it at all probable that a Roman guard should be found off their
watch, much less asleep, when it was instant death, according to the
Roman military laws, to be found in this state?

3dly. Could they be so sound asleep as not to awake with all the noise
which must be necessarily made by removing the great stone, and taking
away the body?

4thly. Is it at all likely that these disciples could have had time
sufficient to do all this, and to come and return, without being
perceived by any person? And

5thly. If they were asleep, how could they possibly know that it was the
disciples that stole him, or indeed that any person or persons stole
him? - for, being asleep, they could see no person. From their own
testimony, therefore, the resurrection may be as fully proved as the
theft.

[Matthew 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 28:14</span></span>

If this came to the governor's ears - Pilate - we will persuade him that
it is for his own interest and honor to join in the deception; and we
will render you secure - we will take care that you shalt not suffer
that punishment for this pretended breach of duty which otherwise you
might expect.

[Matthew 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 28:15</span></span>

Until this day - That is to say, the time in which Matthew wrote his
Gospel; which is supposed by some to have been eight, by others
eighteen, and by others thirty years after our Lord's resurrection.

[Matthew 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 28:16</span></span>

Then the eleven disciples went - When the women went and told them that
they had seen the Lord, and that he had promised to meet them in
Galilee. From the eleventh to the fifteenth verse inclusive, should be
read in a parenthesis, as the sixteenth verse is the continuation of the
subject mentioned in the tenth.

[Matthew 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 28:17</span></span>

But some doubted - That is, Thomas only at first doubted. The expression
simply intimates, that they did not all believe at that time. See the
same form noticed on [Mat 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#008) (note.md),
and [Mat 27:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#044) (note.md).

[Matthew 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 28:18</span></span>

And Jesus came and spake unto them - It is supposed by some that the
reason why any doubted was, that when they saw Jesus at first, he was at
a distance; but when he came up, drew near to them, they were fully
persuaded of the identity of his person.

All power is given unto me - Or, All authority in heaven and upon earth
is given unto me. One fruit of the sufferings and resurrection of Christ
is represented to be, his having authority or right in heaven to send
down the Holy Spirit - to raise up his followers thither - and to crown
them in the kingdom of an endless glory: in earth, to convert sinners;
to sanctify, protect, and perfect his Church; to subdue all nations to
himself; and, finally, to judge all mankind. If Jesus Christ were not
equal with the Father, could he have claimed this equality of power,
without being guilty of impiety and blasphemy? Surely not; and does he
not, in the fullest manner, assert his Godhead, and his equality with
the Father, by claiming and possessing all the authority in heaven and
earth? - i.e. all the power and authority by which both empires are
governed?

[Matthew 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 28:19</span></span>

Go ye therefore - Because I have the authority aforesaid, and can send
whomsoever I will to do whatsoever I please: - teach, μαθητευσατε, make
disciples of all nations, bring them to an acquaintance with God who
bought them, and then baptize them in the name of the Father. It is
natural to suppose that adults were the first subjects of baptism; for
as the Gospel was, in a peculiar manner, sent to the Gentiles, they must
hear and receive it, before they could be expected to renounce their old
prejudices and idolatries, and come into the bonds of the Christian
covenant. But, certainly, no argument can be drawn from this concession
against the baptism of children. When the Gentiles and Jews had received
the faith and blessings of the Gospel, it is natural enough to suppose
they should wish to get their children incorporated with the visible
Church of Christ; especially if, as many pious and learned men have
believed, baptism succeeded to circumcision, which I think has never yet
been disproved. The apostles knew well that the Jews not only
circumcised the children of proselytes, but also baptized them; and as
they now received a commission to teach and proselyte all the nations,
and baptize them in the name of the holy Trinity, they must necessarily
understand that infants were included: nor could they, the custom of
their country being considered, have understood our Lord differently,
unless he had, in the most express terms, said that they were not to
baptize children, which neither he nor his apostles ever did. And as to
the objection, that the baptized were obliged to profess their faith,
and that, therefore, only adults should be baptized, there is no weight
at all in it; because what is spoken of such refers to those who, only
at that period of life, heard the Gospel, and were not born of parents
who had been Christians; therefore they could not have been baptized
into the Christian faith, forasmuch as no such faith was at their
infancy preached in the world. That the children and even infants, of
proselytes, were baptized among the Jews, and reputed, in consequence,
clean, and partakers of the blessings of the covenant, see proved at
large by Wetstein, in his note on [Mat
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#016.md). - See the note on [Mat
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#006.md), and particularly on [Mar
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#016) (note.md).

In the name of the Father, etc. - Baptism, properly speaking, whether
administered by dipping or sprinkling, signifies a full and eternal
consecration of the person to the service and honor of that Being in
whose name it is administered; but this consecration can never be made
to a creature; therefore the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
are not creatures. Again, baptism is not made in the name of a quality
or attribute of the Divine nature; therefore the Father, and the Son,
and the Holy Spirit, are not qualities or attributes of the Divine
nature. The orthodox, as they are termed, have generally considered this
text as a decisive proof of the doctrine of the holy Trinity: and what
else can they draw from it? Is it possible for words to convey a plainer
sense than these do? And do they not direct every reader to consider the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, as three distinct persons? "But
this I can never believe." I cannot help that - you shall not be
persecuted by me for differing from my opinion. I cannot go over to you;
I must abide by what I believe to be the meaning of the Scriptures. Dr.
Lightfoot has some good thoughts on this commission given to the
apostles: -

"I. Christ commands them to go and baptize the nations: but how much
time was past before such a journey was taken! And when the time was now
come that this work should be begun, Peter doth not enter upon it
without a previous admonition given him from heaven. And this was
occasioned hereby, that, according to the command of Christ, the Gospel
was first to be preached to Judea, Samaria, and Galilee.

"II. He commands them to baptize in the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost; but among the Jews, they baptized only in
the name of Jesus. See [Act 2:38](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#038.md); [Act
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#016.md); [Act
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#005.md). For this reason, that thus the
baptizers might assert, and the baptized confess, Jesus to be the true
Messias; which was chiefly controverted by the Jews. Of the same nature
is that apostolic blessing, Grace and peace from God the Father, and
from our Lord Jesus Christ. Where then is the Holy Ghost? He is not
excluded, however he be not named. The Jews did more easily consent to
the Spirit of the Messias, which they very much celebrate, than to the
person of the Messias. Above all others they deny and abjure Jesus of
Nazareth. It belonged to the apostles, therefore, the more earnestly to
assert Jesus (to be the Messias) by how much the more vehemently they
opposed him: which being once cleared, the acknowledging of the Spirit
of Christ would be introduced without delay or scruple. Moses, (in [Exo
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#014).md), going about to reckon up all
the tribes of Israel, goes no farther than the tribe of Levi; and takes
up with that to which his business and story at that present related. In
like manner, the apostles, for the present, baptize in the name of
Jesus, and bless in the name of the Father and of Jesus, that thereby
they might more firmly establish the doctrine of Jesus, which met with
such sharp and virulent opposition; which doctrine being established
among them, they would soon agree about the Holy Ghost.

"III. Among the Jews, the controversy was about the true Messias; among
the Gentiles, about the true God. It was therefore proper among the Jews
to baptize in the name of Jesus, that he might be vindicated to be the
true Messias. Among the Gentiles, in the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost, that they might be hereby instructed in the
doctrine of the true God. - Let this be particularly noted.

"IV. The Jews baptized proselytes into the name of the Father, that is,
into the profession of God, whom they called by the name of Father. The
apostles baptize the Jews into the name of Jesus the Son, and the
Gentiles, into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost.

"V. The Father hath revealed himself in the old covenant; the Son in the
new; in human flesh by his miracles, doctrine, resurrection and
ascension; the Holy Ghost in his gifts and miracles. Thus the doctrine
of the ever blessed Trinity grew by degrees to full maturity. For the
arriving to the acknowledgment of which, it was incumbent upon all who
professed the true God to be three in one to be baptized into his name."
Lightfoot's Works, vol. ii. p. 274.

[Matthew 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mat 28:20</span></span>

Teaching them to observe all things - Men are ignorant of Divine things,
and must be taught. Only those can be considered as proper teachers of
the ignorant who are thoroughly instructed in whatsoever Christ has
commanded. Persons who are entrusted with the public ministry of the
word should take care that they teach not human creeds and confessions
of faith, in place of the Sacred Writings; but those things, and those
only, which Jesus has commanded.

And, lo, I am with you alway - και ιδου εγω μεθ' ὑμων ειμι πασας τας
ἡμερας - literally, Behold, I am with you every day. A minister of
Christ should consider, that while his soul simply and uniformly follows
Jesus, he shall be made a constant instrument of bringing many sons and
daughters to glory. The dark, it is true, must be enlightened, the
ignorant instructed, the profligate reclaimed, the guilty justified, and
the unholy sanctified; and who is sufficient for this work? He with whom
the Son of God is Every Day, and none other.

Unto the end of the world - Some translate, ἑως της συντελειας του
αιωνος, to the end of this age; meaning the apostolic age, or Jewish
dispensation; and then they refer the promise of Christ's presence to
the working of miracles, and explain this by [Mar
16:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#017.md). By my name they shall cast
out demons, etc., etc. But though the words are used in this sense in
several places, see [Mat 13:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#039.md), [Mat
13:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#040.md), [Mat
13:49](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#049.md); [Mat
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#003.md), yet it is certain they were
repeatedly used among the primitive ecclesiastical writers to denote the
consummation of all things; and it is likely that this is the sense in
which they are used here, which the Anglo-Saxon has happily expressed: -
And I, be with you all days, until world ending; and this is
indispensably necessary, because the presence and influence of Jesus
Christ are essentially requisite in every age of the world, to
enlighten, instruct, and save the lost. The promise takes in not only
the primitive apostles, but also all their successors in the Christian
ministry, as long as the earth shall endure.

Amen - This word is omitted by some of the oldest and most authentic
MSS., and by some versions and fathers. When it is considered that the
word amen simply means so be it! we may at once perceive that it could
not be added by our Lord. For our Lord could not pray that his own will
might be done, or his own promise fulfilled. The word is, therefore,
utterly impertinent as a part of the sacred text, and could neither have
been added by our Lord, nor by the evangelist. The amens at the end of
the sacred books have no other authority than what they derive from the
transcribers of copies; and, at best, are only to be considered as the
pious wish of the writer, or of the Church, that the promises contained
in the sacred volume may be accomplished. Indeed, it seems often to have
no other meaning than our finis at the end of our books.

In the MSS. and versions there are various subscriptions, or epigraphs,
to this Gospel: the following are the principal: -

"The Gospel according to Matthew - written by him in Jerusalem - in
Palestine - in the east - in the Hebrew dialect - in Hebrew - eight
years after the ascension of Christ - interpreted by John - by James the
brother of the Lord."

The subscription in some copies of the Arabic version is very full: "The
end of the copy of the Gospel of Matthew the Apostle. He wrote it in the
land of Palestine, by inspiration of the Holy Spirit, in the Hebrew
tongue, eight years after the bodily ascension of Jesus the Messiah into
heaven, in the first year of the reign of Claudius Caesar, king of
Rome."

These are sufficient to show how little credit should be attached to the
subscriptions found at the end of the sacred books, either in the MSS.,
or in the versions.

1\. In concluding my notes on this evangelist, I cannot express myself
better than in the words of the late Mr. Wakefield, to whom this
commentary has been in many instances indebted. "I have now finished my
observations on the Gospel of Matthew: a piece of history, it must be
acknowledged, the most singular in its composition, the most wonderful
in its contents, and the most important in its object, that was ever
exhibited to the notice of mankind. For simplicity of narrative, and an
artless relation of facts, without any applause or censure, or
digressive remarks, on the part of the historian, upon the characters
introduced in it; without any intermixture of his own opinion, upon any
subject whatsoever; and for a multiplicity of internal marks of
credibility, this Gospel certainly has no parallel among human
productions."

2\. One thing the pious and intelligent reader has, no doubt, already
noticed: there is not one truth, or doctrine, in the whole oracles of
God, which is not taught in this evangelist. The outlines of the whole
spiritual system are here correctly laid down: even Paul himself has
added nothing; he has amplified and illustrated the truths contained in
this Gospel; but, even under the direct inspiration of the Holy Ghost,
neither he nor any other of the apostles have brought to light any one
truth, the prototype of which has not been found in the words or acts of
our blessed Lord, as related by Matthew, in the work which has already
passed under review. The Gospel by St. Matthew is the grand text-book of
Christianity; the other Gospels are collateral evidences of its truth,
and the apostolic epistles are comments on the text. In the commencement
of this work, I stated my wish, "to assist my fellow laborers in the
vineyard to lead men to Him who is the fountain of all excellence,
goodness, truth, and happiness; - to magnify his Law, and make it
honorable; - to show the wonderful provision made in his Gospel for the
recovery and salvation of a sinful world; - to prove that God's great
design is to make his creatures Happy; and that such a salvation as it
becomes God to give, and such as man needs to receive, is within the
grasp of every human soul." - General Preface, before Genesis. And
having thus far done what I could, in reference to these great and
important purposes, here I register my thanks to the ever-blessed God,
Father, Word, and Holy Spirit, that he has permitted me to cast my mite
into this sacred treasury, to add my feeble testimony to his Eternal
Truth; and has spared me, in the midst of many infirmities and
oppressive labors, to see the conclusion of this Gospel, a consummation
which I had long devoutly wished, but which I had scarcely hoped ever to
see realized. May the Divine Author of this sacred book give the reader
a heart-felt experience of all the truths it contains; make and keep him
wise unto salvation; build him up in this most holy faith; and give him
an inheritance among the blessed, through Christ Jesus, the Friend of
mankind, and the Savior of sinners, who is the object and end of this
glorious system of truth! And to Him, with the Father and Eternal
Spirit, be glory and dominion, thanksgiving and obedience, for ever and
ever, Amen and amen!
