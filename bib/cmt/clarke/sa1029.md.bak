### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 29:0</span></span>

The Philistines gather their armies together against Israel, and encamp
at Aphek; while the Israelites encamp at Jezreel, [Sa1
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#001.md). The lords of the Philistines
refuse to let David go to battle with them, lest he should betray them,
[Sa1 29:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#002.md). Achish expresses his
confidence in David; but begs him to return, [Sa1
29:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#006.md). David and his men return,
[Sa1 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#011.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 29:1</span></span>

To Aphek - This was a place in the valley of Jezreel, between Mounts
Tabor and Gilboa.

Pitched by a fountain - To be near a fountain, or copious spring of
water, was a point of great importance to an army in countries such as
these, where water was so very scarce. It is supposed, as William of
Tyre says, that it was at this same fountain that Saladin pitched his
camp, while Baldwin, king of Jerusalem, pitched his by another fountain
between Nazareth and Sephoris; each being anxious to secure that without
which it was impossible for their armies to subsist.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 29:2</span></span>

By hundreds, and by thousands - They were probably divided, as the
Jewish armies, by fifties, hundreds, and thousands; each having its
proper officer or captain.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 29:3</span></span>

These days, or these years - I suppose these words to mark no definite
time, and may be understood thus: "Is not this David, who has been with
me for a considerable time?"

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 29:4</span></span>

The princes of the Philistines were wroth - It is strange that they had
not yet heard of David's destruction of a village of the Geshurites,
Gezrites, and Amalekites, [Sa1 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#008.md),
[Sa1 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#009.md). Had they heard of this,
they would have seen much more cause for suspicion.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 29:6</span></span>

Thou hast been upright - So he thought, for as yet he had not heard of
the above transaction; David having given him to understand that he had
been fighting against Israel.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 29:8</span></span>

David said - what have I done? - Dr. Chandler and others may say what
they will to make David act a consistent part in this business; but it
is most evident, whatever his intentions might be as to the part he was
to take in the approaching battle, he did intend to persuade Achish that
he would fight against Israel; and affects to feel his reputation
injured by not being permitted on this occasion to show his fidelity to
the king of Gath.

It was in the order of God's gracious providence that the Philistine
lords refused to let David go with them to this battle. Had he gone, he
had his choice of two sins - First, If he had fought for the
Philistines, he would have fought against God and his country. Secondly
If he had in the battle gone over to the Israelites, he would have
deceived and become a traitor to the hospitable Achish. God, therefore,
so ordered it in his mercy that he was not permitted to go to a battle
in which he was sure to be disgraced, whatever side he took, or with
what success soever he might be crowned.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 29:9</span></span>

As an angel of God - There is some reason to think that Achish had
actually embraced or was favourably disposed towards the Jewish
religion. He speaks here of the angels of God, as a Jew might be
expected to speak; and in [Sa1 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#006.md) he
appeals to, and swears by Jehovah; which, perhaps, no Philistine ever
did. It is possible that he might have learned many important truths
from David, during the time he sojourned with him.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 29:10</span></span>

With thy master's servants - Who were these? has been very properly
asked; and to this question there can be but two answers: -

1\. The six hundred Israelites which were with him; and who might still
be considered the subjects of Saul, though now residing in a foreign
land.

2\. The servants of achish; i.e., David's men thus considered; because
on his coming to Gath, he had in effect given up himself and his men to
Achish. But Saul may be the master to whom Achish refers, and the words
convey a delicate information to David that he is no vassal, but still
at liberty.
