### [Proverbs Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">pro 4:0</span></span>

The preceptor calls his pupils, and tells them how himself was educated,
[Pro 4:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#001.md); specifies the teachings he
received, [Pro 4:5-19](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#005.md); and exhorts his
pupil to persevere in well-doing, and to avoid evil, [Pro
4:20-27](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#020.md).

[Proverbs 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 4:1</span></span>

Hear, ye children - Come, my pupils, and hear how a father instructed
his child. Such as I received from my father I give to you, and they
were the teachings of a wise and affectionate parent to his only son, a
peculiar object of his regards, and also those of a fond mother.

He introduces the subject thus, to show that the teaching he received,
and which he was about to give them, was the most excellent of its kind.
By this he ensured their attention, and made his way to their heart.
Teaching by precept is good; teaching by example is better; but teaching
both by precept and example is best of all.

[Proverbs 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 4:4</span></span>

He taught me also, and said - Open thy heart to receive my instructions
- receive them with affection; when heard, retain and practice them; and
thou shalt live - the great purpose of thy being brought into the world
shall be accomplished in thee.

[Proverbs 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 4:5</span></span>

Get wisdom - True religion is essential to thy happiness; never forget
its teachings, nor go aside from the path it prescribes.

[Proverbs 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 4:6</span></span>

Forsake her not - Wisdom personified is here represented as a guardian
and companion, who, if not forsaken, will continue faithful; if loved,
will continue a protector.

[Proverbs 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 4:7</span></span>

Wisdom is the principal thing - ראשית חכמה reshith chochmah, "wisdom is
the principle." It is the punctum saliens in all religion to know the
true God, and what he requires of man, and for what he has made man; and
to this must be added, under the Christian dispensation, to know Jesus
Christ whom he hath sent, and for what end He was sent, the necessity of
his being sent, and the nature of that salvation which he has bought by
his own blood.

Get wisdom - Consider this as thy chief gain; that in reference to which
all thy wisdom, knowledge, and endeavors should be directed.

And with all thy getting - Let this be thy chief property. While thou
art passing through things temporal, do not lose those things which are
eternal; and, while diligent in business, be fervent in spirit, serving
the Lord.

Get understanding - Do not be contented with the lessons of wisdom
merely; do not be satisfied with having a sound religious creed; devils
believe and tremble; but see that thou properly comprehend all that thou
hast learnt; and see that thou rightly apply all that thou hast been
taught.

Wisdom prescribes the best end, and the means best calculated for its
attainment. Understanding directs to the ways, times, places, and
opportunities of practicing the lessons of wisdom. Wisdom points out the
thing requisite; understanding sees to the accomplishment and
attainment. Wisdom sees; but understanding feels. One discovers, the
other possesses.

Coverdale translates this whole verse in a very remarkable manner: "The
chefe poynte of wyssdome is, that thou be wyllynge to opteyne wyssdome;
and before all thy goodes to get the understandynge." This is
paraphrase, not translation. In this version paraphrase abounds.

The translation in my old MS. Bible is very simple: Begynnynge of
wisdam, welle thou wisdom; in al thi wisdam, and in al thi possioun,
purchas prudence. He is already wise who seeks wisdom; and he is wise
who knows its value, seeks to possess it. The whole of this verse is
wanting in the Arabic, and in the best copies of the Septuagint.

Instead of קנה חכמה keneh chochmah, get wisdom, the Complutensian
Polyglot has קנה בינה keneh binah, get understanding; so that in it the
verse stands, "Wisdom is the principle, get understanding; and in all
this getting, get understanding." This is not an error either of the
scribe, or of the press, for it is supported by seven of the MSS. of
Kennicott and De Rossi.

The Complutensian, Antwerp, and Paris Polyglots have the seventh verse
in the Greek text; but the two latter, in general, copy the former.

[Proverbs 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 4:8</span></span>

She shall bring thee to honor - There is nothing, a strict life of piety
and benevolence excepted, that has such a direct tendency to reflect
honor upon a man, as the careful cultivation of his mind. One of Bacon's
aphorisms was, Knowledge is power; and it is truly astonishing to see
what influence true learning has. Nothing is so universally respected,
provided the learned man be a consistent moral character, and be not
proud and overbearing; which is a disgrace to genuine literature.

[Proverbs 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 4:9</span></span>

A crown of glory - A tiara, diadem, or crown, shall not be more
honorable to the princely wearer, than sound wisdom - true religion -
coupled with deep learning, shall be to the Christian and the scholar.

[Proverbs 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 4:10</span></span>

The years of thy life shall be many - Vice and intemperance impair the
health and shorten the days of the wicked; while true religion,
sobriety, and temperance, prolong them. The principal part of our
diseases springs from "indolence, intemperance, and disorderly
passions." Religion excites to industry, promotes sober habits, and
destroys evil passions, and harmonizes the soul; and thus, by preventing
many diseases, necessarily prolongs life.

[Proverbs 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 4:12</span></span>

Thy steps shall not be straitened - True wisdom will teach thee to keep
out of embarrassments. A man under the influence of true religion
ponders his paths, and carefully poises occurring circumstances; and as
the fear of God will ever lead him to act an upright and honest part, so
his way in business and life is both clear and large. He has no by-ends
to serve; he speculates not; he uses neither trick nor cunning to effect
any purpose. Such a man can never be embarrassed. His steps are not
straitened; he sees his way always plain; and when a favorable tide of
Providence shows him the necessity of increased exertion, he runs, and
is in no danger of stumbling.

[Proverbs 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 4:13</span></span>

Take fast hold - החזק hachazek, seize it strongly, and keep the hold;
and do this as for life. Learn all thou canst, retain what thou hast
learnt, and keep the reason continually in view - it is for thy life.

[Proverbs 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 4:14</span></span>

Enter not into the path of the wicked - Never associate with those whose
life is irregular and sinful; never accompany them in any of their acts
of transgression.

[Proverbs 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 4:15</span></span>

Avoid it - Let it be the serious purpose of thy soul to shun every
appearance of evil.

Pass not by it - Never, for the sake of worldly gain, or through
complaisance to others, approach the way that thou wouldst not wish to
be found in when God calls thee into the eternal world.

Turn from it - If, through unwatchfulness or unfaithfulness, thou at any
time get near or into the way of sin, turn from it with the utmost
speed, and humble thyself before thy Maker.

And pass away - Speed from it, run for thy life, and get to the utmost
distance; eternally diverging so as never to come near it whilst thou
hast a being.

[Proverbs 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 4:16</span></span>

Except they have done mischief - The night is their time for spoil and
depredation. And they must gain some booty, before they go to rest. This
I believe to be the meaning of the passage. I grant, also, that there
may be some of so malevolent a disposition that they cannot be easy
unless they can injure others, and are put to excessive pain when they
perceive any man in prosperity, or receiving a kindness. The address in
Virgil, to an illnatured shepherd is well known: -

Et cum vidisti puero donata, dolebas:

Et si non aliqua nocuisses, mortuus esses.

Eclog. 3: 14.

"When thou sawest the gifts given to the lad, thou wast distressed; and
hadst thou not found some means of doing him a mischief, thou hadst
died."

[Proverbs 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 4:17</span></span>

For they eat the bread of wickedness - By privately stealing.

And drink the wine of violence - By highway robbery.

[Proverbs 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 4:18</span></span>

But the path of the just - The path of the wicked is gloomy, dark, and
dangerous; that of the righteous is open, luminous, and instructive.
This verse contains a fine metaphor; it refers to the sun rising above
the horizon, and the increasing twilight, till his beams shine full upon
the earth. The original, הולך ואור עד נכון היום holech vaor ad nechon
haiyom, may be translated, "going and illuminating unto the prepared
day." This seems plainly to refer to the progress of the rising sun
while below the horizon; and the gradual increase of the light
occasioned by the reflection of his rays by means of the atmosphere,
till at last he is completely elevated above the horizon, and then the
prepared day has fully taken place, the sun having risen at the
determined time. So, the truly wise man is but in his twilight here
below; but he is in a state of glorious preparation for the realms of
everlasting light; till at last, emerging from darkness and the shadows
of death, he is ushered into the full blaze of endless felicity. Yet
previously to his enjoyment of this glory, which is prepared for him, he
is going - walking in the commandments of his God blameless; and
illuminating - reflecting the light of the salvation which he has
received on all those who form the circle of his acquaintance.

[Proverbs 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 4:21</span></span>

Keep them in the midst of thine heart - Let them be wrapped up in the
very center of thy affections; that they may give spring and energy to
every desire, word, and wish.

[Proverbs 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 4:23</span></span>

Keep thy heart with all diligence - "Above all keeping," guard thy
heart. He who knows any thing of himself, knows how apt his affections
are to go astray.

For out of it are the issues of life - תוצאות חיים totseoth chaiyim,
"the goings out of lives." Is not this a plain allusion to the arteries
which carry the blood from the heart through the whole body, and to the
utmost extremities? As long as the heart is capable of receiving and
propelling the blood, so long life is continued. Now as the heart is the
fountain whence all the streams of life proceed, care must be taken that
the fountain be not stopped up nor injured. A double watch for its
safety must be kept up. So in spiritual things: the heart is the seat of
the Lord of life and glory; and the streams of spiritual life proceed
from him to all the powers and faculties of the soul. Watch with all
diligence, that this fountain be not sealed up, nor these streams of
life be cut off. Therefore "put away from thee a froward mouth and
perverse lips - and let thy eyes look straight on." Or, in other words,
look inwardlook onward - look upward.

I know that the twenty-third verse is understood as principally
referring to the evils which proceed from the heart, and which must be
guarded against; and the good purposes that must be formed in it, from
which life takes its colouring. The former should be opposed; the latter
should be encouraged and strengthened. If the heart be pure and holy,
all its purposes will be just and good. If it be impure and defiled,
nothing will proceed from it but abomination. But though all this be
true, I have preferred following what I believe to be the metaphor in
the text.

[Proverbs 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 4:24</span></span>

A froward mouth - Beware of hastiness, anger, and rash speeches.

And perverse lips - Do not delight in nor acquire the habit of
contradicting and gainsaying; and beware of calumniating and backbiting
your neighbor.

[Proverbs 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 4:26</span></span>

Ponder the path of thy feet - Weigh well the part thou shouldst act in
life. See that thou contract no bad habits.

[Proverbs 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 4:27</span></span>

Turn not to the right hand nor to the left - Avoid all crooked ways. Be
an upright, downright, and straight-forward man. Avoid tricks, wiles,
and deceptions of this kind.

To this the Septuagint and Vulgate add the following verse: Αυτος δε
ορθας ποιησει τας τροχιας σου, τας δε πορειας σου εν ειρηνη προαξει.
Ipse autem rectos faciet cursus tuos; itinera autem tua in pace
producet. "For himself will make thy paths straight and thy journeyings
will he conduct in prosperity." The Arabic has also a clause to the same
effect. But nothing like this is found in the Hebrew, Chaldee, or
Syriac; nor in the Vulgate, as printed in the Complutensian Polyglot;
nor in that of Antwerp or of Paris; but it is in the Greek text of those
editions, in the editio princeps of the Vulgate, in five of my own MSS.,
and in the old MS. Bible. De Lyra rejects the clause as a gloss that
stands on no authority. If an addition, it is certainly very ancient;
and the promise it contains is true whether the clause be authentic or
not.
