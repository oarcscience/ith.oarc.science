### [Jeremiah Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#001)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 19:0</span></span>

By the significant type of breaking a potter's vessel, Jeremiah is
directed to predict the utter desolation of Judah and Jerusalem, [Jer
19:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#001). The prophets taught
frequently by symbolic actions as well as by words.

[Jeremiah 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 19:1</span></span>

Go and get a potter's earthen bottle - This discourse was also delivered
some time in the reign of Jehoiakim. Under the type of breaking a
potter's earthen bottle or jug, Jeremiah shows his enemies that the word
of the Lord should stand, that Jerusalem should be taken and sacked, and
they all carried into captivity.

Ancients of the priests - The chiefs of the twenty-four classes which
David had established. See [Ch1 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#004).

[Jeremiah 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 19:4</span></span>

Estranged this place - Ye have devoted my temple to a widely different
purpose from that for which it was erected.

[Jeremiah 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 19:5</span></span>

Offerings unto Baal - A general name for all the popular idols; Baal,
Moloch, Ashtaroth, etc.

[Jeremiah 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 19:7</span></span>

I will make void the counsel of Judah - Probably this refers to some
determination made to proclaim themselves independent, and pay no more
tribute to the Chaldeans.

To be meat for the fowls - See on [Jer
7:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#033) (note).

[Jeremiah 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 19:9</span></span>

I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons - This was literally
fulfilled when Jerusalem was besieged by the Romans. This also the
prophet might have had in view.

[Jeremiah 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 19:11</span></span>

Even so will I break this people and this city - The breaking of the
bottle was the symbolical representation of the destruction of the city
and of the state.

That cannot be made whole again - This seems to refer rather to the
final destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, than to what was done by
the Chaldeans. Jerusalem was healed after 70 years: but nearly 1800
years have elapsed since Jerusalem was taken and destroyed by the
Romans; and it was then so broken, that it could not be made whole
again.

[Jeremiah 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 19:12</span></span>

And even make this city as Tophet - A place of slaughter and
destruction.

[Jeremiah 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 19:14</span></span>

Then came Jeremiah from Tophet - He had probably gone to the valley of
Hinnom, and there repeated the discourse which he had a little before
delivered to the chief priests and elders.

[Jeremiah 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 19:15</span></span>

Because they have hardened their necks - A metaphor taken from unruly
and unbroken oxen, who resist the yoke, break and run away with their
gears. So this people had broken and destroyed the yoke of the law.
