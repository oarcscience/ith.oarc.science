### [2 Corinthians Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001.md)

[2 Corinthians](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">co2 5:0</span></span>

The apostle's strong hope of eternal glory, and earnest longings after
that state of blessedness, [Co2 5:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001.md).
The assurance that he had of it from the Holy Spirit, and his
carefulness to be always found pleasing to the Lord, [Co2
5:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#005.md). All must appear before the
judgment seat of Christ, [Co2 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#010.md).
Knowing that this awful event must take place, he labored to convince
men of the necessity of being prepared to meet the Lord, being
influenced to this work by his love of Christ, [Co2
5:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#011.md). Jesus Christ having died for
all, is a proof that all were dead, [Co2
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#014.md). Those for whom he died should
live to him, [Co2 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#015.md). We should know
no man after the flesh, [Co2 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#016.md).
They who are in Christ are new creatures, [Co2
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017.md). The glorious ministry of
reconciliation, [Co2 5:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#018.md).

[2 Corinthians 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 5:1</span></span>

If our earthly house of this tabernacle - By earthly house, the apostle
most evidently means the body in which the soul is represented as
dwelling or sojourning for a time, and from which it is to be liberated
at death; for as death dissolves the tabernacle, it can then be no
habitation for the soul. The apostle also alludes here to the ancient
Jewish tabernacle, which, on all removals of the congregation, was
dissolved and taken in pieces; and the ark of the covenant, covered with
its own curtains, was carried by itself; and when they came to the place
of rest, then the dissolved parts of the tabernacle were put together as
before. When we consider this simile in connection with the doctrine of
the resurrection, which the apostle has treated so much at large in
these epistles, and which he keeps constantly in view, then we shall see
that he intends to convey the following meaning: that as the tabernacle
was taken down in order to be again put together, so the body is to be
dissolved, in order to be re-edified; that as the ark of the covenant
subsisted by itself, while the tabernacle was down, so can the soul when
separated from the body; that as the ark had then its own veil for its
covering, [Exo 40:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#021.md), so the soul is
to have some vehicle in which it shall subsist till it receives its body
at the resurrection.

A building of God - Some think this refers to a certain celestial
vehicle with which God invests holy souls on their dismissal from the
body; others suppose it relates to the resurrection body; and some
imagine that it relates merely to the state of blessedness which the
saints shall possess in the kingdom of glory. See the following note.

[2 Corinthians 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co2 5:2</span></span>

For in this we groan - While in this state, and in this body, we are
encompassed with many infirmities, and exposed to many trials, so that
life is a state of discipline and affliction, and every thing within and
around us says, "Arise and depart, for this is not your rest!" Those who
apply these words to what they call the apostle's sense of indwelling
sin, abuse the passage. There is nothing of the kind either mentioned or
intended.

Desiring to be clothed upon with our house - This and the following
verses are, in themselves, exceedingly obscure, and can be only
interpreted by considering that the expressions used by the apostle are
all Jewish, and should be interpreted according to their use of them.
Schoettgen has entered largely into the argument here employed by the
apostle, and brought forth much useful information.

He observes,

1\. That the Hebrew word לבש labash, which answers to the apostle's
ενδυσασθαι, to be clothed, signifies to be surrounded, covered, or
invested with any thing. So, to be clothed with the uncircumcision,
signifies to be uncircumcised. Yalcut Rubeni, fol. 163.

On the words, [Exo 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#018.md), Moses went
into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up into the mount, Sohar Exod.,
fol. 77, has these words, He went into the midst of the cloud, as if one
put on a garment; so he was Clothed with the Cloud. Sohar Levit., fol.
29: "The righteous are in the terrestrial paradise, where their souls
are clothed with the lucid crown;" i.e. they are surrounded, encompassed
with light, etc.

2\. The word בית beith, House, in Hebrew often denotes a cover, case, or
clothing. So, in the Targum of Onkelos, בית אפי beith appei, the House
or the Face, is a veil; and so בית אצבעים beith etsbaim, the House of
the Fingers, and בית יד beith yad, the House of the Hand, signify
gloves; בית רגלים beith regalim, the House of the Feet, shoes.
Therefore, οικητηριον - επενδυσασθαι, to be clothed on with a house, may
signify any particular qualities of the soul; what we, following the
very same form of speech, call a habit, i.e. a coat or vestment. So we
say the man has got a habit of vice, a habit of virtue, a habit of
swearing, of humility, etc., etc.

3\. The Jews attribute garments to the soul, both in this and the other
world; and as they hold that all human souls pre-exist, they say that,
previously to their being appointed to bodies, they have a covering
which answers the same end to them before they come into life as their
bodies do afterwards. And they state that the design of God in sending
souls into the world is, that they may get themselves a garment by the
study of the law and good works. See several proofs in Schoettgen.

4\. It is plain, also, that by this garment or covering of the soul they
mean simply what we understand by acquiring the image of God - being
made holy. This image they assert "Adam lost by his fall, and they
represent man in a sinful state as being naked." So they represent the
Israelites before their making the molten calf, as having received holy
garments from Mount Sinai; but afterwards, having worshipped the calf,
they were stripped of these, and left naked.

5\. But notwithstanding they speak of this clothing as implying
righteous and holy dispositions, and heavenly qualities, yet they all
agree in assigning certain vehicles to separate spirits, in which they
act; but of these vehicles they have strange notions; yet they
acknowledge that without them, whether they be of light, fire, etc., or
whatever else, they cannot see and contemplate the Supreme Wisdom. In
Synopsis Sohar, page 137, we have these words: "When the time draws near
in which a man is to depart from this world, the angel of death takes
off his mortal garment and clothes him with one from paradise, in which
he may see and contemplate the Supreme Wisdom; and therefore the angel
of death is said to be very kind to man, because he takes off from him
the garment of this world, and clothes him with a much more precious one
prepared in paradise."

When the apostle says that they earnestly desired to be clothed upon
with our house which is from heaven, he certainly means that the great
concern of all the genuine followers of God was to be fully prepared to
enjoy the beatific vision of their Maker and Redeemer.

[2 Corinthians 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 5:3</span></span>

If so be that being clothed - That is, fully prepared in this life for
the glory of God;

We shall not be found naked - Destitute in that future state of that
Divine image which shall render us capable of enjoying an endless glory.

[2 Corinthians 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 5:4</span></span>

For we that are in this tabernacle - We who are in this state of trial
and difficulty do groan, being burdened; as if he had said: The whole of
human life is a state of suffering, and especially our lot; who are
troubled on every side, perplexed, persecuted, cast down, bearing about
in the body the dying of our Lord Jesus, and being always delivered unto
death on the account of Jesus, [Co2
4:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#008.md). These were sufficient burdens,
and sufficient causes of groaning.

Not for that we would be unclothed - We do not desire death, nor to die,
even with the full prospect of eternal glory before our eyes, an hour
before that time which God in his wisdom has assigned.

But clothed upon - To have the fullest preparation for eternal glory. We
wish not to die, whatever tribulation we may be called to pass through,
till the whole will of God is accomplished in us and by us.

That mortality might be swallowed up of life - Being fully prepared for
the eternal state we shall scarcely be said to die, all that is mortal
being absorbed and annihilated by immortality and glory. See the notes
on [Co1 15:51-56](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#051) (note.md). From the use
of these expressions among the Jews, this seems to be the general
meaning of the apostle.

[2 Corinthians 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 5:5</span></span>

Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing - God has given us
our being and our body for this very purpose, that both might be made
immortal, and both be glorified together. Or, God himself has given us
this insatiable hungering and thirsting after righteousness and
immortality. Mr. Addison has made a beautiful paraphrase of the sense of
the apostle, whether he had his words in view or not: -

" - Whence this pleasing hope, this fond desire,

This longing after immortality?

Or whence this secret dread and inward horror

Of falling into nought? Why shrinks the soul

Back on herself, and startles at destruction?

'Tis the Divinity that stirs within us;

'Tis Heaven itself that points out an hereafter,

And intimates eternity to man. -

The soul, secured in her existence, smiles

At the drawn dagger, and defies its point.

The stars shall fade away, the sun himself

Grow dim with age, and nature sink in years;

But thou shalt flourish in immortal youth,

Unhurt amidst the war of elements,

The wreck of matter, and the crush of worlds."

The earnest of the Spirit - See the note on [Co2
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#022.md).

[2 Corinthians 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 5:6</span></span>

We are always confident - Θαρῥουντες ουν παντοτε· We are always full of
courage; we never despond; we know where our help lies; and, having the
earnest of the Spirit, we have the full assurance of hope.

Whilst we are at home in the body, etc. - The original words in this
sentence are very emphatic: ενδημειν signifies to dwell among one's own
people; εκδημειν, to be a sojourner among a strange people. Heaven is
the home of every genuine Christian, and is claimed by them as such; see
[Phi 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#023.md). Yet, while here below, the
body is the proper home of the soul; but as the soul is made for eternal
glory, that glory is its country; and therefore it is considered as
being from its proper home while below in the body. As all human souls
are made for this glory, therefore all are considered, while here, to be
absent from their own country. And it is not merely heaven that they
have in view, but the Lord; without whom, to an immortal spirit
possessed of infinite desires, heaven would neither be a home nor a
place of rest. We see plainly that the apostle gives no intimation of an
intermediate state between being at home in the body and being present
with the Lord. There is not the slightest intimation here that the soul
sleeps, or rather, that there is no soul; and, when the body is
decomposed, that there is no more of the man till the resurrection: I
mean, according to the sentiments of those who do condescend to allow us
a resurrection, though they deny us a soul. But this is a philosophy in
which St. Paul got no lessons, either from Gamaliel, Jesus Christ, the
Holy Ghost, or in the third heaven, where he heard even unutterable
things.

[2 Corinthians 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 5:7</span></span>

For we walk by faith - While we are in the present state faith supplies
the place of direct vision. In the future world we shall have sight -
the utmost evidence of spiritual and eternal things; as we shall be
present with them, and live in them. Here we have the testimony of God,
and believe in their reality, because we cannot doubt his word. And to
make this more convincing he gives us the earnest of his Spirit, which
is a foretaste of glory.

[2 Corinthians 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co2 5:8</span></span>

We are confident - We are of good courage, notwithstanding our many
difficulties; because we have this earnest of the Spirit, and the
unfailing testimony of God. And notwithstanding this, we are willing
rather to be absent from the body - we certainly prefer a state of glory
to a state of suffering, and the enjoyment of the beatific vision to
even the anticipation of it by faith and hope; but, as Christians, we
cannot desire to die before our time.

[2 Corinthians 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co2 5:9</span></span>

Wherefore we labor - Φιλοτιμουμεθα· from φιλος, loving, and τιμη, honor;
we act at all times on the principles of honor; we are, in the proper
sense of the word, ambitious to do and say every thing consistently with
our high vocation: and, as we claim kindred to the inhabitants of
heaven, to act as they do.

We may be accepted of him - Ευαρεστοι αυτῳ ειναι To be pleasing to him.
Through the love we have to God, we study and labor to please him. This
is and will be our heaven, to study to love, please, and serve him from
whom we have received both our being and its blessings.

[2 Corinthians 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 5:10</span></span>

For we must all appear before the judgment seat - We labor to walk so as
to please him, because we know that we shall have to give a solemn
account of ourselves before the judgment seat of Christ; where he, whose
religion we profess, will judge us according to its precepts, and
according to the light and grace which it affords.

That every one may receive the things - Κομισηται ἑκαστος· That each may
receive to himself, into his own hand, his own reward and his own wages.

The things done in his body - That is, while he was in this lower state;
for in this sense the term body is taken often in this epistle. We may
observe also that the soul is the grand agent, the body is but its
instrument. And it shall receive according to what it has done in the
body.

[2 Corinthians 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 5:11</span></span>

Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord - This, I think, is too harsh a
translation of ειδοτες ουν τον φοβον του Κυριου, which should be
rendered, knowing therefore the fear of the Lord; which, strange as it
may at first appear, often signifies the worship of the Lord, or that
religious reverence which we owe to him; [Act
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#031.md); [Rom
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#018.md); [Rom
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#007.md); [Pe1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#017.md); [Pe1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#018.md); [Pe1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#002.md). As we know therefore what God
requires of man, because we are favored with his own revelation, we
persuade men to become Christians, and to labor to be acceptable to him,
because they must all stand before the judgment seat; and if they
receive not the grace of the Gospel here, they must there give up their
accounts with sorrow and not with joy. In short, a man who is not saved
from his sin in this life, will be separated from God and the glory of
his power in the world to come. This is a powerful motive to persuade
men to accept the salvation provided for them by Christ Jesus. The fear
of God is the beginning of wisdom; the terror of God confounds and
overpowers the soul. We lead men to God through his fear and love, and
with the fear of God the love of God is ever consistent; but where the
terror of the Lord reigns there can neither be fear, faith, nor love;
nay, nor hope either. Men who vindicate their constant declamations on
hell and perdition by quoting this text, know little of its meaning;
and, what is worse, seem to know but little of the nature of man, and
perhaps less of the spirit of the Gospel of Christ. Let them go and
learn a lesson from Christ, sweeping over Jerusalem: "O Jerusalem,
Jerusalem, how oft would I have gathered you together, as a hen would
her brood under her wings!" And another from his last words on the
cross, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do!"

But we are made manifest unto God - God, who searches the heart, knows
that we are upright in our endeavors to please him; and because we are
fully persuaded of the reality of eternal things, therefore we are fully
in earnest to get sinners converted to him.

Manifest in your consciences - We have reason to believe that you have
had such proof of our integrity and disinterestedness, that your
consciences must acquit us of every unworthy motive, and of every
sinister view.

[2 Corinthians 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 5:12</span></span>

For we commend not ourselves? - I do not say these things to bespeak
your good opinion, to procure your praise; but to give you an occasion
to glory - to exult on our behalf; and to furnish you with an answer to
all those who either malign us or our ministry, and who only glory in
appearance - have no solid ground of exultation, and whose heart is
dishonest and impure. St. Paul probably speaks here concerning the false
apostle, who had been dividing the Church and endeavoring to raise a
party to himself, by vilifying both the apostle and his doctrine.

[2 Corinthians 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co2 5:13</span></span>

Beside ourselves - Probably he was reputed by some to be deranged.
Festus thought so: Paul, thou art beside thyself; too much learning hath
made thee mad. And his enemies at Corinth might insinuate not only that
he was deranged, but attribute his derangement to a less worthy cause
than intense study and deep learning.

It is to God - If we do appear, in speaking of the glories of the
eternal world, to be transported beyond ourselves, it is through the
good hand of our God upon us, and we do it to promote his honor.

Whether we be sober - Speak of Divine things in a more cool and
dispassionate manner, it is that we may the better instruct and
encourage you.

[2 Corinthians 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co2 5:14</span></span>

For the love of Christ constraineth us - We have the love of God shed
abroad in our hearts, and this causes us to love God intensely, and to
love and labor for the salvation of men. And it is the effect produced
by this love which συνεχει ἡμας, bears us away with itself, which causes
us to love after the similitude of that love by which we are influenced;
and as God so loved the world as to give his Son for it, and as Christ
so loved the world as to pour out his life for it, so we, influenced by
the very same love, desire to spend and be spent for the glory of God,
and the salvation of immortal souls. By the fear of God the apostles
endeavored to persuade and convince men, and the love of Christ
constrained them so to act.

If one died for all, then were all dead - The first position the apostle
takes for granted; viz. that Jesus Christ died for All mankind. This no
apostolic man nor primitive Christian ever did doubt or could doubt.

The second position he infers from the first, and justly too; for if all
had not been guilty, and consigned to eternal death because of their
sins there could have been no need of his death. Therefore, as he most
certainly died for All, then all were dead, and needed his sacrifice,
and the quickening power of his Spirit.

[2 Corinthians 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co2 5:15</span></span>

And that he died for all, that they which live, etc. - This third
position he draws from the preceding: If all were dead, and in danger of
endless perdition; and if he died for all, to save them from that
perdition; then it justly follows that they are not their own, that they
are bought by his blood; and should not live unto themselves, for this
is the way to final ruin; but unto him who died for them, and thus made
an atonement for their sins, and rose again for their justification.

[2 Corinthians 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co2 5:16</span></span>

Know we no man after the flesh - As we know that all have sinned and
come short of the glory of God; and as we know that all are alienated
from God, and are dead in trespasses and sins; therefore we esteem no
man on account of his family relations, or the stock whence he
proceeded, because we see all are shut up in unbelief, and all are
children of wrath.

Yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh - We cannot esteem a
man who is a sinner, were he even allied to the blood royal of David,
and were he of the same family with the man Christ himself; nor can we
prize a man because he has seen Christ in the flesh; for many have seen
him in the flesh to whom he will say; Depart from me, for I never knew
you. So we: nothing weighs with us, nor in the sight of God, but
redemption from this death, and living to him who died for them.

We know that the Jews valued themselves much in having Abraham for their
father; and some of the Judaizing teachers at Corinth might value
themselves in having seen Christ in the flesh, which certainly St. Paul
did not; hence he takes occasion to say here that this kind of privilege
availed nothing; for the old creature, however noble, or well descended
in the sight of men, is under the curse; and the new creature only is
such as God can approve.

[2 Corinthians 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co2 5:17</span></span>

If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature - It is vain for a man to
profess affinity to Christ according to the flesh, while he is unchanged
in his heart and life, and dead in trespasses and sins; for he that is
in Christ, that is, a genuine Christian, having Christ dwelling in his
heart by faith, is a new creature; his old state is changed: he was a
child of Satan, he is now a child of God; he was a slave of sin, and his
works were death; he is now made free from sin, and has his fruit unto
holiness, and the end everlasting life. He was before full of pride and
wrath; he is now meek and humble. He formerly had his portion in this
life, and lived for this world alone; he now hath God for his portion,
and he looks not at the things which are seen, but at the things which
are eternal. Therefore, old things are passed away.

Behold, all things are become new - The man is not only mended, but he
is new made; he is a new creature, καινη κτισις, a new creation, a
little world in himself; formerly, all was in chaotic disorder; now,
there is a new creation, which God himself owns as his workmanship, and
which he can look on and pronounce very good. The conversion of a man
from idolatry and wickedness was among the Jews denominated a new
creation. He who converts a man to the true religion is the same, says
R. Eliezer, as if he had created him.

[2 Corinthians 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co2 5:18</span></span>

And all things are of God - As the thorough conversion of the soul is
compared to a new creation, and creation is the proper work of an
all-wise, almighty Being; then this total change of heart, soul, and
life, which takes place under the preaching of the Gospel, is effected
by the power and grace of God: this is salvation, and salvation must
ever be of the Lord; and therefore men should apply to him, who alone
can work this wondrous change.

Who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ - Having given Jesus
Christ to die for sinners, they have through him access unto God; for
his sake and on his account God can receive them; and it is only by the
grace and Spirit of Christ that the proud, fierce, and diabolic nature
of men can be changed and reconciled to God, and by and through this
sacrifice God can be propitious to them. There is an enmity in the heart
of man against sacred things; the grace of Christ alone can remove this
enmity.

The ministry of reconciliation - Διακονιαν της καταλλαγης· The Office or
function of this reconciliation called, [Co2
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019.md), the word; τον λογον της
καταλλαγης· the Doctrine of this reconciliation. Καταλλαγη,
reconciliation, comes from καταλλασσω, to change thoroughly; and the
grand object of the Gospel is to make a complete change in men's minds
and manners; but the first object is the removal of enmity from the
heart of man, that he may be disposed to accept of the salvation God has
provided for him, on the terms which God has promised. The enmity in the
heart of man is the grand hinderance to his salvation.

[2 Corinthians 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co2 5:19</span></span>

That God was in Christ - This is the doctrine which this ministry of
reconciliation holds out, and the doctrine which it uses to bring about
the reconciliation itself.

God was in Christ:

1\. Christ is the same as Messiah, the Anointed One, who was to be
prophet, priest, and king, to the human race; not to the Jews only, but
also to the Gentiles. There had been prophets, priests, and kings, among
the Jews and their ancestors; and some who had been priest and prophet,
king and priest, and king and prophet; but none have ever sustained in
his own person the threefold office except Christ; for none have ever
ministered in reference to the whole world but he. The functions of all
the others were restrained to the ancient people of God alone.

2\. Now all the others were appointed of God in reference to this
Christ; and as his types, or representatives, till the fullness of the
time should come.

3\. And that this Christ might be adequate to the great work of
reconciling the whole human race to God, by making atonement for their
sins, God was in him. The man Jesus was the temple and shrine of the
eternal Divinity; for in him dwelt all the fullness of the Godhead
bodily, [Col 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009.md); and he made peace by
the blood of his cross.

4\. Christ, by his offering upon the cross, made atonement for the sins
of the world; and therefore one important branch of the doctrine of this
reconciliation was to show that God would not impute or account their
trespasses to them, so as to exact the penalty, because this Jesus had
died in their stead.

The whole of this important doctrine was short, simple, and plain. Let
us consider it in all its connections:

1\. You believe there is a God.

2\. You know he has made you.

3\. He requires you to love and serve him.

4\. To show you how to do this he has given a revelation of himself,
which is contained in his law, etc.

5\. You have broken this law, and incurred the penalty, which is death.

6\. Far from being able to undo your offenses, or make reparation to the
offended majesty of God, your hearts, through the deceitfulness and
influence of sin, are blinded, hardened, and filled with enmity, against
your Father and your Judge.

7\. To redeem you out of this most wretched and accursed state, God; in
his endless love, has given his Son for you; who has assumed your
nature, and died in your stead.

8\. In consequence of this he has commanded repentance towards God, and
remission of sins, to be published in his name in all the earth.

9\. All who repent, and believe in Christ as having died for them as a
sin-offering, ([Co2 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021).md), shall
receive remission of sins.

10\. And if they abide in him they shall have an eternal inheritance
among them that are sanctified.

We are ambassadors for Christ - Ὑπερ Χριστου - πρεσβευομεν. We execute
the function of ambassadors in Christ's stead. He came from the Father
to mankind on this important embassy. He has left the world, and
appointed us in his place.

Ambassador is a person sent from one sovereign power to another; and is
supposed to represent the person of the sovereign by whom he is deputed.
Christ while on earth represented the person of the Sovereign of the
world; his apostles and their successors represent the person of Christ.
Christ declared the will of the Father to mankind; apostles, etc.,
declare the will of Christ to the world. We are ambassadors for Christ.

As though God did beseech you by us - What we say to you we say on the
authority of God; our entreaties are his entreaties; our warm love to
you, a faint reflection of his infinite love; we pray you to return to
God, it is his will that you should do so; we promise you remission of
sins, we are authorized to do so by God himself. In Christ's stead we
pray you to lay aside your enmity and be reconciled to God; i.e. accept
pardon, peace, holiness, and heaven; which are all procured for you by
his blood, and offered to you on his own authority.

"What unparalleled condescension and divinely tender mercies are
displayed in this verse! Did the judge ever beseech a condemned criminal
to accept of pardon? Does the creditor ever beseech a ruined debtor to
receive an acquittance in full? Yet our almighty Lord, and our eternal
Judge, not only vouchsafes to offer these blessings, but invites us,
entreats us, and with the most tender importunity solicits us not to
reject them." The Rev. J. Wesley's notes in loc.

This sentiment is farther expressed in the following beautiful poetic
version of this place, by the Rev. Charles Wesley: -

"God, the offended God most high,

Ambassadors to rebels sends;

His messengers his place supply,

And Jesus begs us to be friends.

Us, in the stead of Christ, they pray,

Us, in the stead of Christ, entreat,

To cast our arms, our sins, away,

And find forgiveness at his feet.

Our God, in Christ, thine embassy

And proffer'd mercy we embrace;

And, gladly reconciled to thee,

Thy condescending mercy praise.

Poor debtors, by our Lord's request

A full acquittance we receive;

And criminals, with pardon blest,

We, at our Judge's instance, live."

[2 Corinthians 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co2 5:21</span></span>

For he hath made him to be sin for us - Τον μη γνοντα ἁμαρτιαν, ὑπερ
ἡμων ἁμαρτιαν εποιησεν· He made him who knew no sin, (who was innocent),
a sin-offering for us. The word ἁμαρτια occurs here twice: in the first
place it means sin, i.e. transgression and guilt; and of Christ it is
said, He knew no sin, i.e. was innocent; for not to know sin is the same
as to be conscious of innocence; so, nil conscire sibi, to be conscious
of nothing against one's self, is the same as nulla pallescere culpa, to
be unimpeachable.

In the second place, it signifies a sin-offering, or sacrifice for sin,
and answers to the חטאה chattaah and חטאת chattath of the Hebrew text;
which signifies both sin and sin-offering in a great variety of places
in the Pentateuch. The Septuagint translate the Hebrew word by ἁμαρτια
in ninety-four places in Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers, where a
sin-offering is meant; and where our version translates the word not
sin, but an offering for sin. Had our translators attended to their own
method of translating the word in other places where it means the same
as here, they would not have given this false view of a passage which
has been made the foundation of a most blasphemous doctrine; viz. that
our sins were imputed to Christ, and that he was a proper object of the
indignation of Divine justice, because he was blackened with imputed
sin; and some have proceeded so far in this blasphemous career as to
say, that Christ may be considered as the greatest of sinners, because
all the sins of mankind, or of the elect, as they say, were imputed to
him, and reckoned as his own. One of these writers translates the
passage thus: Deus Christum pro maximo peccatore habuit, ut nos essemus
maxime justi, God accounted Christ the greatest of sinners, that we
might be supremely righteous. Thus they have confounded sin with the
punishment due to sin. Christ suffered in our stead; died for us; bore
our sins, (the punishment due to them), in his own body upon the tree,
for the Lord laid upon him the iniquities of us all; that is, the
punishment due to them; explained by making his soul - his life, an
offering for sin; and healing us by his stripes.

But that it may be plainly seen that sin-offering, not sin, is the
meaning of the word in this verse, I shall set down the places from the
Septuagint where the word occurs; and where it answers to the Hebrew
words already quoted; and where our translators have rendered correctly
what they render here incorrectly. In Exodus, [Exo

Besides the above places, it occurs in the same signification, and is
properly translated in our version, in the following places: -

45:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#023.md), [Eze
45:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#025.md). In all, one hundred and eight
places, which, in the course of my own reading in the Septuagint, I have
marked.

That we might be made the righteousness of God in him - The
righteousness of God signifies here the salvation of God, as
comprehending justification through the blood of Christ, and
sanctification through his Spirit or, as the mountains of God, the hail
of God, the wind of God, mean exceeding high mountains, extraordinary
hail, and most tempestuous wind; so, here, the righteousness of God may
mean a thorough righteousness, complete justification, complete
sanctification; such as none but God can give, such as the sinful nature
and guilty conscience of man require, and such as is worthy of God to
impart. And all this righteousness, justification, and holiness, we
receive in, by, for, and through Him, as the grand, sacrificial,
procuring, and meritorious cause of these, and every other blessing.
Some render the passage: We are justified through him; before God; or,
We are justified, according to God's plan of justification, through him.

In many respects, this is a most important and instructive chapter.

1\. The terms house, building, tabernacle, and others connected with
them, have already been explained from the Jewish writings. But it has
been thought by some that the apostle mentions these as readily offering
themselves to him from his own avocation, that of a tentmaker; and it is
supposed that he borrows these terms from his own trade in order to
illustrate his doctrine; This supposition would be natural enough if we
had not full evidence that these terms were used in the Jewish theology
precisely in the sense in which the apostle uses them here. Therefore,
it is more likely that he borrowed them from that theology, than from
his own trade.

2\. In the terms tabernacle, building of God, etc., he may refer also to
the tabernacle in the wilderness, which was a building of God, and a
house of God, and as God dwelt in that building, so he will dwell in the
souls of those who believe in, love, and obey him. And this will be his
transitory temple till mortality is swallowed up of life, and we have a
glorified body and soul to be his eternal residence.

3\. The doctrines of the resurrection of the same body; the witness of
the Spirit; the immateriality of the soul; the fall and miserable
condition of all mankind; the death of Jesus, as an atonement for the
sins of the whole world; the necessity of obedience to the Divine will,
and of the total change of the human heart, are all introduced here: and
although only a few words are spoken on each, yet these are so plain and
so forcible as to set those important doctrines in the most clear and
striking point of view.

4\. The chapter concludes with such a view of the mercy and goodness of
God in the ministry of reconciliation, as is no where else to be found.
He has here set forth the Divine mercy in all its heightenings; and who
can take this view of it without having his heart melted down with love
and gratitude to God, who has called him to such a state of salvation.

5\. It is exceedingly remarkable that, through the whole of this
chapter, the apostle speaks of himself in the first person plural; and
though he may intend other apostles, and the Christians in general, yet
it is very evident that he uses this form when only himself can be
meant, as in [Co2 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#012.md) and [Co2
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#013.md), as well as in several places of
the following chapter. This may be esteemed rather more curious than
important.
