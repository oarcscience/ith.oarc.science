### [Judges Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#001.md)

[Judges](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jdg 6:0</span></span>

The Israelites again do evil, and are delivered into the hands of the
Midianites, by whom they are oppressed seven years, [Jdg
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#001.md), [Jdg
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#002.md). Different tribes spoil their
harvests, and take away their cattle, [Jdg
6:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#003.md). They cry unto the Lord, and he
sends them a prophet to reprehend and instruct them, [Jdg
6:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#006.md). An angel appears unto Gideon,
and gives him commission to deliver Israel, and works several miracles,
to prove that he is Divinely appointed to this work, [Jdg
6:11-23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#011.md). Gideon builds an altar to the
Lord, under the name of Jehovah-shalom; and throws down the altar of
Baal, [Jdg 6:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#024.md). His townsmen
conspire against him; he expostulates with them, and they are pacified,
[Jdg 6:28-32](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#028.md). The Midianites and
Amalekites gather together against Israel; Gideon summons Manasseh,
Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, who join his standard, [Jdg
6:33-35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#033.md). The miracle of the fleece of
wool, [Jdg 6:36-40](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#036.md).

[Judges 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 6:1</span></span>

Delivered them unto the hand of Midian - The Midianites were among the
most ancient and inveterate of the enemies of Israel. They joined with
the Moabites to seduce them to idolatry, and were nearly extirpated by
them; [Num 31:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#001.md). The Midianites
dwelt on the eastern borders of the Dead Sea, and their capital was
Arnon.

[Judges 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 6:2</span></span>

Made them the dens which are in the mountains - Nothing can give a more
distressing description of the state of the Israelites than what is here
related. They durst not reside in the plain country, but were obliged to
betake themselves to dens and caves of the mountains, and live like wild
beasts, and were hunted like them by their adversaries.

[Judges 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 6:3</span></span>

Children of the East - Probably those who inhabited Arabia Deserta,
Ishmaelites.

[Judges 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 6:4</span></span>

Encamped against them - Wandering hordes of Midianites, Amalekites, and
Ishmaelites came, in the times of harvest and autumn, and carried away
their crops, their fruit, and their cattle. And they appear to have come
early, encamped in the plains, and watched the crops till they were
ready to be carried off. This is frequently the case even to the present
day.

Till thou come unto Gaza - That is, the whole breadth of the land, from
Jordan to the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. Thus the whole land was
ravaged, and the inhabitants deprived of the necessaries of life.

[Judges 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jdg 6:5</span></span>

They came up with their cattle and their tents - All this proves that
they were different tribes of wanderers who had no fixed residence; but,
like their descendants the Bedouins or wandering Arabs, removed from
place to place to get prey for themselves and forage for their cattle.

[Judges 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 6:8</span></span>

The Lord sent a prophet - The Jews say that this was Phinehas; but it is
more likely that it was some prophet or teacher raised up by the Lord to
warn and instruct them. Such were his witnesses, and they were raised up
from time to time to declare the counsel of God to his rebellious
people.

[Judges 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 6:11</span></span>

There came an angel of the Lord - The prophet came to teach and exhort,
the angel comes to confirm the word of the prophet, to call and
commission him who was intended to be their deliverer, and to work
miracles, in order to inspire him with supernatural courage and a
confidence of success.

Ophrah - Or Ephra, was a city, or village rather, in the half tribe of
Manasseh, beyond Jordan.

His son Gideon threshed wheat - This is not the only instance in which a
man taken from agricultural employments was made general of an army, and
the deliverer of his country. Shamgar was evidently a ploughman, and
with his ox-goad he slew many Philistines, and became one of the
deliverers of Israel. Cincinnatus was taken from the plough, and was
made dictator and commander-in-chief of the Roman armies. There is a
great similarity between his case and that of Gideon.

Threshed wheat by the winepress - This was a place of privacy; he could
not make a threshing-floor in open day as the custom was, and bring
either the wheel over the grain, or tread it out with the feet of the
oxen, for fear of the Midianites, who were accustomed to come and take
it away as soon as threshed. He got a few sheaves from the field, and
brought them home to have them privately threshed for the support of the
family. As there could be no vintage among the Israelites in their
present distressed circumstances, the winepress would never be suspected
by the Midianites to be the place of threshing corn.

[Judges 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jdg 6:12</span></span>

The Lord is with thee - "The Word of the Lord is with thee, thou mighty
man of valor." - Targum. It appears that Gideon had proved himself, on
former occasions, to be a man of courage and personal prowess; and this
would naturally excite the confidence of his countrymen. God chooses for
his work those instruments which, in the course of his operations in
nature and providence, he has qualified for his purpose. The instruments
thus chosen are generally unlikely, but they will be ever found the best
qualified for the Divine employment.

[Judges 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jdg 6:13</span></span>

And Gideon said unto him - This speech is remarkable for its energy and
simplicity; it shows indeed a measure of despondency, but not more than
the circumstances of the case justified.

[Judges 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jdg 6:14</span></span>

Go in this thy might - What does the angel mean? He had just stated that
Jehovah was with him; and he now says, Go in This thy might, i.e., in
the might of Jehovah, who is with thee.

[Judges 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jdg 6:15</span></span>

Wherewith shall I save Israel? - I have neither men nor money.

Behold, my family is poor in Manasseh - הנה אלפי הדל, Behold, my
thousand is impoverished. Tribes were anciently divided into tens, and
fifties, and hundreds, and thousands; the thousands therefore marked
grand divisions, and consequently numerous families; Gideon here
intimates that the families of which he made a part were very much
diminished. But if we take אלפי alpey for the contracted form of the
plural, which is frequently in Hebrew nouns joined with a verb in the
singular, then the translation will be, "The thousands in Manasseh are
thinned;" i.e., this tribe is greatly reduced, and can do little against
their enemies.

[Judges 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jdg 6:16</span></span>

Thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man - Thou shalt as surely
conquer all their host as if thou hadst but one man to contend with; or,
Thou shalt destroy them to a man.

[Judges 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jdg 6:17</span></span>

Show me a sign - Work a miracle, that I may know that thou hast wisdom
and power sufficient to authorize and quality me for the work.

[Judges 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jdg 6:18</span></span>

And bring forth my present - My minchah; generally an offering of bread,
wine, oil, flour, and such like. It seems from this that Gideon supposed
the person to whom he spoke to be a Divine person. Nevertheless, what he
prepared and brought out appears to be intended simply as an
entertainment to refresh a respectable stranger.

[Judges 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jdg 6:19</span></span>

Made ready a kid - the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in
a pot - The manner in which the Arabs entertain strangers will cast
light on this verse. Dr. Shaw observes: "Besides a bowl of milk, and a
basket of figs, raisins, or dates, which upon our arrival were presented
to us to stay our appetite, the master of the tent fetched us from his
flock according to the number of our company, a kid or a goat, a lamb or
a sheep; half of which was immediately seethed by his wife, and served
up with cucasoe; the rest was made kab-ab, i.e., cut to pieces and
roasted, which we reserved for our breakfast or dinner next day." May we
not suppose, says Mr. Harmer, that Gideon, presenting some slight
refreshment to the supposed prophet, according to the present Arab mode,
desired him to stay till he could provide something more substantial;
that he immediately killed a kid, seethed part of it, and, when ready,
brought out the stewed meat in a pot, with unleavened cakes of bread
which he had baked; and the other part, the kab-ab, in a basket, for him
to carry with him for some after-repast in his journey. See Shaw's and
Pococke's Travels, and Harmer's Observations.

Brought it out unto him under the oak - Probably where he had a tent,
which, with the shade of the oak, sheltered them from the heat of the
sun, and yet afforded the privilege of the refreshing breeze. Under a
shade in the open air the Arabs, to the present day, are accustomed to
receive their guests.

[Judges 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jdg 6:20</span></span>

Take the flesh, etc. - The angel intended to make the flesh and bread an
offering to God, and the broth a libation.

[Judges 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jdg 6:21</span></span>

The angel - put forth the end of the staff - He appeared like a traveler
with a staff in his hand; this he put forth, and having touched the
flesh, fire rose out of the rock and consumed it. Here was the most
evident proof of supernatural agency.

Then the angel - departed out of his sight - Though the angel vanished
out of his sight, yet God continued to converse with him either by
secret inspiration in his own heart, or by an audible voice.

[Judges 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jdg 6:22</span></span>

Alas, O Lord God! for because I have seen - This is an elliptical
sentence, a natural expression of the distressed state of Gideon's mind:
as if he had said, Have mercy on me, O Lord God! else I shall die;
because I have seen an angel of Jehovah face to face. We have frequently
seen that it was a prevalent sentiment, as well before as under the law,
that if any man saw God, or his representative angel he must surely die.
On this account Gideon is alarmed, and prays for his life. This notion
prevailed among the heathens, and we find an instance of it in the fable
of Jupiter and Semele. She wished to see his glory; she saw it, and was
struck dead by the effulgence. See the notes on [Exo
33:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#020.md). We find that a similar opinion
prevailed very anciently among the Greeks. In the hymn of Callimachus,
Εις Λουτρα της Παλλαδος, ver. 100, are these words: -

Κρονιοι δ' ὡδε λεγοντι νομοι·

Ὁς κε τιν' αθανατων, ὁκα μη θεος αυτος ἑληται,

Αθρησῃ, μισθῳ τουτον ιδειν μεγαλῳ.

"The laws of Saturn enact, that if any man see any of the immortal gods,
unless that god himself shall choose it, he shall pay dearly for that
sight."

[Judges 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jdg 6:23</span></span>

Fear not: thou shalt not die - Here the discovery is made by God
himself: Gideon is not curiously prying into forbidden mysteries,
therefore he shall not die.

[Judges 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jdg 6:24</span></span>

Gideon built an altar - and called it Jehovah-shalom - The words יהוה
שלום Yehovah shalom signify The Lord is my peace, or The peace of
Jehovah; and this name he gave the altar, in reference to what God had
said, [Jdg 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#023.md), Peace be unto thee,
שלום לך shalom lecha, "Peace to thee;" which implied, not only a wish,
but a prediction of the prosperous issue of the enterprise in which he
was about to engage. It is likely that this is the altar which is
mentioned in [Jdg 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#026.md), and is spoken
of here merely by anticipation.

[Judges 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jdg 6:25</span></span>

Take thy father's young bullock, even the second bullock - There is some
difficulty in this verse, for, according to the Hebrew text, two
bullocks are mentioned here; but there is only one mentioned in [Jdg
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#026.md), [Jdg
6:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#028.md). But what was this second
bullock? Some think that it was a bullock that was fattened in order to
be offered in sacrifice to Baal. This is very probable, as the second
bullock is so particularly distinguished from another which belonged to
Gideon's father. As the altar was built upon the ground of Joash, yet
appears to have been public property, (see [Jdg
6:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#029.md), [Jdg
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#030).md), so this second ox was probably
reared and fattened at the expense of the men of that village, else why
should they so particularly resent its being offered to Jehovah?

[Judges 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jdg 6:26</span></span>

With the wood of the grove - It is probable that אשרה Asherah here
signifies Astarte; and that there was a wooden image of this goddess on
the altar of Baal. Baal-peor was the same as Priapus, Astarte as Venus;
these two impure idols were proper enough for the same altar. In early
times, and among rude people, the images of the gods were made of wood.
This is the case still with the inhabitants of the South Sea Islands,
with the Indians of America, and with the inhabitants of Ceylon: many of
the images of Budhoo are of wood. The Scandinavians also had wooden
gods.

[Judges 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jdg 6:27</span></span>

He feared his father's household - So it appears that his father was an
idolater: but as Gideon had ten men of his own servants whom he could
trust in this matter, it is probable that he had preserved the true
faith, and had not bowed his knee to the image of Baal.

[Judges 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jdg 6:28</span></span>

The second bullock was offered - It appears that the second bullock was
offered because it was just seven years old, [Jdg
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#025.md), being calved about the time that
the Midianitish oppression began; and it was now to be slain to indicate
that their slavery should end with its life. The young bullock, [Jdg
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#025.md), is supposed to have been offered
for a peace-offering; the bullock of seven years old, for a
burnt-offering.

[Judges 6:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jdg 6:29</span></span>

Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing - They fixed on him the
more readily because they knew he had not joined with them in their
idolatrous worship.

[Judges 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jdg 6:30</span></span>

The men of the city said - They all felt an interest in the continuance
of rites in which they had often many sensual gratifications. Baal and
Ashtaroth would have more worshippers than the true God, because their
rites were more adapted to the fallen nature of man.

[Judges 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jdg 6:31</span></span>

Will ye plead for Baal? - The words are very emphatic "Will ye plead in
earnest תריבן for Baal? Will ye תושיען really save him? If he be God,
אלהים Elohim, let him contend for himself, seeing his altar is thrown
down." The paragogic letters in the words plead and save greatly
increase the sense. Joash could not slay his son; but he was satisfied
he had insulted Baal: if Baal were the true God, he would avenge his own
injured honor. This was a sentiment among the heathens. Thus Tacitus,
lib. i., c. 73, A.U.C. 768, mentioning the letter of Tiberius to the
consuls in behalf of Cassius and Rubrius, two Roman knights, one of whom
was accused of having sold a statue of Augustus in the auction of his
gardens; and the other, of having sworn falsely by the name of Augustus,
who had been deified by the senate; among other things makes him say:
Non ideo decretum patri suo coelum, ut in perniciem civium is honor
verteretur. Nec contra religiones fieri quod effigies ejus, utalia nu
minum simulachra, venditionibus hortorum et domuum accedant. Jusjurandum
perinde aestimandum quam si Jovem fefellisset: deorum injuriae diis
curae - "That Divine honors were not decreed to his father (Augustus) to
lay snares for the citizens; and if his statue, in common with the
images of the gods in general, was put up to sale with the houses and
gardens, it could not be considered an injury to religion. That any
false oath must be considered as an attempt to deceive Jupiter himself;
but the gods themselves must take cognizance of the injuries done unto
them." Livy has a similar sentiment, Hist. lib. x., c. 6, where,
speaking of some attempts made to increase the number of the augurs out
of the commons, with which the senators were displeased, he says:
Simulabant ad deos id magis, quam ad se pertinere; ipsos visuros, ne
sacra sua polluantur. - "They pretended that these things belonged more
to the gods than themselves; and that they would take care that their
sacred rites were not polluted."

[Judges 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jdg 6:32</span></span>

He called him Jerubbaal - That is, Let Baal contend; changed, [Sa2
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#021.md), into Jerubbesheth, he shall
contend against confusion or shame; thus changing baal, lord, into
bosheth, confusion or ignominy. Some think that Jerubbaal was the same
with Jerombalus, who, according to Sanchoniatho and Porphyry, was a
priest of Jevo. But the history of Sanchoniatho is probably a forgery of
Porphyry himself, and worthy of no credit.

[Judges 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jdg 6:33</span></span>

Then all the Midianites - Hearing of what Gideon had done, and
apprehending that this might be a forerunner of attempts to regain their
liberty, they formed a general association against Israel.

[Judges 6:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jdg 6:34</span></span>

The Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon - He was endued with
preternatural courage and wisdom.

[Judges 6:36](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">jdg 6:36</span></span>

If thou wilt save Israel - Gideon was very bold, and God was very
condescending. But probably the request itself was suggested by the
Divine Spirit. On the miracle of the fleece, dew, and dry ground,
Origen, in his eighth homily on the book of Judges, has many curious and
interesting thoughts, I shall insert the substance of the whole: - The
fleece is the Jewish nation. The fleece covered with dew, while all
around is dry, the Jewish nation favored with the law and the prophets.
The fleece dry, the Jewish nation cast off for rejecting the Gospel. All
around watered, the Gospel preached to the Gentiles. and they converted
to God. The fleece on the threshing-floor, the Jewish people in the land
of Judea, winnowed, purged, and fanned by the Gospel. The dew wrung out
into the bowl, the doctrines of Christianity, extracted from the Jewish
writings, shadowed forth by Christ's pouring water into a basin, and
washing the disciples' feet. The pious father concludes that he has now
wrung this water out of the fleece of the book of Judges, as he hopes by
and by to do out of the fleece of the book of Kings, and out of the
fleece of the book of Isaiah or Jeremiah; and he has received it into
the basin of his heart, and there conceived its true sense; and is
desirous to wash the feet of his brethren, that they may be able to walk
in the way of the preparation of the Gospel of peace. - Origen, Op. vol.
ii., p. 475, edit. Benedict. All this to some will doubtless appear
trifling; but it is not too much to say that scarcely any pious mind can
consider the homily of this excellent man without drinking into a
measure of the same spirit, so much sincerity, deep piety, and unction,
appear throughout the whole: yet as I do not follow such practices, I
cannot recommend them. Of dealers in such small wares, we have many that
imitate Benjamin Keach, but few that come nigh to Origen.
