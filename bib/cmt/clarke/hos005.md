### [Hosea Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001)

[Hosea](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">hos 5:0</span></span>

This chapter begins with threatening the Israelites for ensnaring the
people to idolatry by their sacrifices and other rites on Mizpah and
Tabor, [Hos 5:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001). Their sacrifices,
however costly, are declared to be unacceptable, [Hos
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#006); and their substance is devoted to
the locust, [Hos 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#007). Nor is judgment
to stop here. The cities of Judah are called upon, in a very animated
manner, to prepare for the approach of enemies. Benjamin is to be
pursued; Ephraim is to be desolate; and all this is intimated to Israel,
that they may by repentance avert the judgment, [Hos
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#008), [Hos
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#009). The following verses contain
farther denunciations, [Hos 5:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#010),
expressed in terms equally terrible and sublime, [Hos
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#014). The Lord afflicts not willingly
the children of men; he visits them with temporal calamities that he may
heal their spiritual malady, [Hos
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#015).

[Hosea 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 5:1</span></span>

Hear ye this, O priests - A process is instituted against the priests,
the Israelites, and the house of the king; and they are called on to
appear and defend themselves. The accusation is, that they have ensnared
the people, caused them to practice idolatry, both at Mizpah and Tabor.
Mizpah was situated beyond Jordan; in the mountains of Gilead; see [Jdg
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#029). And Tabor was a beautiful
mountain in the tribe of Zebulum. Both these places are said to be
eminent for hunting etc., and hence the natural occurrence of the words
snare and net, in speaking of them.

[Hosea 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 5:2</span></span>

The revolters are profound to make slaughter - Here may be a reference
to the practice of hunters, making deep pits in the ground, and lightly
covering them over, that the beasts, not discovering them, might fall
in, and become a prey.

Though I have been a Rebuker - "I will bring chastisement on them all."
As they have made victims of others to their idolatry, I will make
victims of them to my justice. Some have thought that as many as wished
to depart from the idolatrous worship set up by Jeroboam, were
slaughtered; and thus Jeroboam the son of Nebat Made Israel to sin.

[Hosea 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 5:3</span></span>

I know Ephraim - I know the whole to be idolaters.

[Hosea 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 5:4</span></span>

They will not frame their doings - They never purpose to turn to God,
they have fully imbibed the spirit of idolatry.

[Hosea 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 5:5</span></span>

The pride of Israel doth testify to his face - The effrontery with which
they practise idolatry manifests, not only their insolence, but the deep
depravity of their heart; but their pride and arrogance shall be
humbled.

[Hosea 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 5:6</span></span>

They shall go with their flocks - They shall offer many sacrifices,
professing to seek and be reconciled to the Lord; but they shall not
find him. As they still retain the spirit of their idolatry, he has
withdrawn himself from them.

[Hosea 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 5:7</span></span>

Now shall a month devour them - In a month's time the king of Assyria
shall be upon them, and oblige them to purchase their lives and
liberties by a grievous tax of fifty shekels per head. This Menahem,
king of Israel, gave to Pul, king of Assyria, [Kg2
15:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#016). Instead of month, some
translate the original locust. "The locusts shall devour them."

[Hosea 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 5:8</span></span>

Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah - Gibeah and Ramah were cities of Judah, in
the tribe of Benjamin.

After thee, O Benjamin - An abrupt call of warning. "Benjamin, fly for
thy life! The enemy is just behind thee!" This is a prediction of the
invasion of the Assyrians, and the captivity of the ten tribes.

[Hosea 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 5:9</span></span>

Among the tribes of Israel have I made known - They have got sufficient
warning; it is their own fault that they have not taken it.

[Hosea 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 5:10</span></span>

Like them that remove the bound - As execrable as they who remove the
land-mark. They have leaped over law's enclosure, and scaled all the
walls of right; they have despised and broken all laws, human and
Divine.

[Hosea 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 5:11</span></span>

Walked after the commandment - Jeroboam's commandment to worship his
calves at Dan and Beth-el. Many of them were not forced to do this, they
did it willingly.

[Hosea 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hos 5:12</span></span>

Unto Ephraim as a moth - I will consume them by little and little, as a
moth frets a garment.

[Hosea 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hos 5:13</span></span>

When Ephraim saw his sickness - When both Israel and Judah felt their
own weakness to resist their enemies, instead of calling upon and
trusting in me, they sought sinful alliances, and trusted in their
idols.

King Jareb - This name occurs nowhere in Scripture but here and in [Hos
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#006). The Vulgate and Targum render
ירב yareb, an avenger, a person whom they thought able to save them from
their enemies. It is well known that Menahem, king of Israel, sought
alliance with Pul and Tiglath-pileser, kings of Assyria, and Ahaz, king
of Judah. These were the protectors that Ephraim sought after. See 2
Kings 15 and 16. But far from healing them by making them tributary, the
Assyrians made their wound more dangerous.

[Hosea 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hos 5:14</span></span>

I will be - as a lion - כשחל cashshachel, as a panther or lioness.

[Hosea 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">hos 5:15</span></span>

I will go and return to my place - I will abandon them till they
acknowledge their offenses. This had the wished-for effect, as we shall
see in the following chapter; for they repented and turned to God, and
he had mercy upon them. These two verses are considered as instances of
the true sublime.
