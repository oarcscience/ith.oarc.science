### [Exodus Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#001.md)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 5:0</span></span>

Moses and Aaron open their commission to Pharaoh, [Exo
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#001.md). He insultingly asks who Jehovah
is, in whose name they require him to dismiss the people, [Exo
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#002.md). They explain, [Exo
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#003.md). He charges them with making the
people disaffected, [Exo 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#004.md), [Exo
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#005.md); and commands the task-masters to
increase their work, and lessen their means of performing it, [Exo
5:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#006.md). The task-masters do as
commanded, and refuse to give the people straw to assist them in making
brick, and yet require the fulfillment of their daily tasks as formerly,
when furnished with all the necessary means, [Exo
5:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#010.md). The Israelites failing to
produce the ordinary quantity of brick, their own officers, set over
them by the task-masters, are cruelly insulted and beaten, [Exo
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#014.md). The officers complain to
Pharaoh, [Exo 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#015.md), [Exo
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#016.md); but find no redress, [Exo
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#017.md), [Exo
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#018.md). The officers, finding their case
desperate, bitterly reproach Moses and Aaron for bringing them into
their present circumstances, [Exo
5:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#019.md). Moses retires, and lays the
matter before the Lord, and pleads with him, [Exo
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#022.md), [Exo
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#023.md).

[Exodus 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 5:1</span></span>

And afterward Moses and Aaron went - This chapter is properly a
continuation of the preceding, as the succeeding is a continuation of
this; and to preserve the connection of the facts they should be read
together.

How simply, and yet with what authority, does Moses deliver his message
to the Egyptian king! Thus saith Jehovah, God of Israel, Let my people
go. It is well in this, as in almost every other case where יהוה Jehovah
occurs, to preserve the original word: our using the word Lord is not
sufficiently expressive, and often leaves the sense indistinct.

[Exodus 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 5:2</span></span>

Who is the Lord - Who is Jehovah, that I should obey his voice? What
claims has he on me? I am under no obligation to him. Pharaoh spoke here
under the common persuasion that every place and people had a tutelary
deity, and he supposed that this Jehovah might be the tutelary deity of
the Israelites, to whom he, as an Egyptian, could be under no kind of
obligation. It is not judicious to bring this question as a proof that
Pharaoh was an atheist: of this the text affords no evidence.

[Exodus 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 5:3</span></span>

Three days' journey - The distance from Goshen to Sinai; see [Exo
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#018.md).

And sacrifice unto the Lord - Great stress is laid on this circumstance.
God required sacrifice; no religious acts which they performed could be
acceptable to him without this. He had now showed them that it was their
indispensable duty thus to worship him, and that if they did not they
might expect him to send the pestilence - some plague or death
proceeding immediately from himself, or the sword - extermination by the
hands of an enemy. The original word דבר deber, from בדר dabar, to drive
off, draw under, etc., which we translate pestilence from the Latin
pestis, the plague, signifies any kind of disease by which an
extraordinary mortality is occasioned, and which appears from the
circumstances of the case to come immediately from God. The Israelites
could not sacrifice in the land of Egypt, because the animals they were
to offer to God were held sacred by the Egyptians; and they could not
omit this duty, because it was essential to religion even before the
giving of the law. Thus we find that Divine justice required the life of
the animal for the life of the transgressor, and the people were
conscious, if this were not done, that God would consume them with the
pestilence or the sword. From the foundation of the world the true
religion required sacrifice. Before, under, and after the law, this was
deemed essential to salvation. Under the Christian dispensation Jesus is
the lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world; and being still
the Lamb newly slain before the throne, no man cometh unto the Father
but by him.

"In this first application to Pharaoh, we observe," says Dr. Dodd, "that
proper respectful submission which is due from subjects to their
sovereign. They represent to him the danger they should be in by
disobeying their God, but do not so much as hint at any punishment that
would follow to Pharaoh."

[Exodus 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 5:4</span></span>

Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron - He hints that the Hebrews are in a
state of revolt, and charges Moses and Aaron as being ringleaders of the
sedition. This unprincipled charge has been, in nearly similar
circumstances, often repeated since. Men who have labored to bring the
mass of the common people from ignorance, irreligion, and general
profligacy of manners, to an acquaintance with themselves and God, and
to a proper knowledge of their duty to him and to each other, have been
often branded as being disaffected to the state, and as movers of
sedition among the people! See Clarke on [Exo
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#017) (note.md).

Let the people - תפריעו taphriu, from פרע para, to loose or disengage,
which we translate to let, from the Anglo-Saxon lettan, to hinder. Ye
hinder the people from working. Get ye to your burdens. "Let religion
alone, and mind your work." The language not only of tyranny, but of the
basest irreligion also.

[Exodus 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 5:5</span></span>

The people of the land now are many - The sanguinary edict had no doubt
been long before repealed, or they could not have multiplied so greatly.

[Exodus 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 5:6</span></span>

The task-masters of the people and their officers - The task-masters
were Egyptians, (see Clarke on [Exo
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#011) (note).md), the officers were
Hebrews; see Clarke below [Exo 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#014.md)
(note). But it is probable that the task-masters [Exo
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#011.md), who are called שרי מסים sarey
missim, princes of the burdens or taxes, were different from those
termed taskmasters here, as the words are different; נגשים nogesim
signifies exactors or oppressors - persons who exacted from them an
unreasonable proportion either of labor or money.

Officers - שטרים shoterim; those seem to have been an inferior sort of
officers, who attended on superior officers or magistrates to execute
their orders. They are supposed to have been something like our
sheriffs.

[Exodus 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 5:7</span></span>

Straw to make brick - There have been many conjectures concerning the
use of straw in making bricks. Some suppose it was used merely for
burning them, but this is unfounded. The eastern bricks are often made
of clay and straw kneaded together, and then not burned, but thoroughly
dried in the sun. This is expressly mentioned by Philo in his life of
Moses, who says, describing the oppression of the Israelites in Egypt,
that some were obliged to work in clay for the formation of bricks, and
others to gather straw for the same purpose, because straw is the bond
by which the brick is held together, πλινθου γαρ αχορα δεσμος - Phil.
Oper., edit. Mang., vol. ii., p. 86. And Philo's account is confirmed by
the most intelligent travelers. Dr. Shaw says that the straw in the
bricks still preserves its original color, which is a proof that the
bricks were never burned. Some of these are still to be seen in the
cabinets of the curious; and there are several from ancient Babylon now
before me, where the straw which was amalgamated with the clay is still
perfectly visible. From this we may see the reason of the complaint made
to Pharaoh, [Exo 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#016.md) : the Egyptians
refused to give the necessary portion of straw for kneading the bricks,
and yet they required that the full tale or number of bricks should be
produced each day as they did when all the necessary materials were
brought to hand; so the people were obliged to go over all the
cornfields, and pluck up the stubble, which they were obliged to
substitute for straw. See [Exo 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#012.md).

[Exodus 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 5:8</span></span>

And the tale of the bricks - Tale signifies the number, from the
Anglo-Saxon to number, to count, etc.

For they be idle; therefore they cry - Let us go and sacrifice - Thus
their desire to worship the true God in a proper manner was attributed
to their unwillingness to work; a reflection which the Egyptians (in
principle) of the present day cast on these who, while they are fervent
in spirit serving the Lord, are not slothful in business. See Clarke
below [Exo 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#017) (note.md).

[Exodus 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 5:14</span></span>

And the officers - were beaten - Probably bastinadoed; for this is the
common punishment in Egypt to the present day for minor offenses. The
manner of it is this: the culprit lies on his belly, his legs being
turned up behind erect, and the executioner gives him so many blows on
the soles of the feet with a stick. This is a very severe punishment,
the sufferer not being able to walk for many weeks after, and some are
lamed by it through the whole of their lives.

[Exodus 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">exo 5:16</span></span>

The fault is in thine own people - חטאת chatath, the sin, is in thy own
people. 1st. Because they require impossibilities; and 2dly, because
they punish us for not doing what cannot be performed.

[Exodus 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 5:17</span></span>

Ye are idle - therefore ye say, Let us go and do sacrifice - It is
common for those who feel unconcerned about their own souls to attribute
the religious earnestness of others, who feel the importance of eternal
things, to idleness or a disregard of their secular concerns. Strange
that they cannot see there is a medium! He who has commanded them to be
diligent in business, has also commanded them to be fervent in spirit,
serving the Lord. He whose diligence in business is not connected with a
true religious fervor of spirit, is a lover of the world; and whatever
form he may have he has not the power of godliness, and therefore is
completely out of the road to salvation.

[Exodus 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">exo 5:19</span></span>

Did see that they were in evil case - They saw that they could neither
expect justice nor mercy; that their deliverance was very doubtful, and
their case almost hopeless.

[Exodus 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 5:21</span></span>

The Lord look upon you, and judge - These were hasty and unkind
expressions; but the afflicted must be allowed the privilege of
complaining; it is all the solace that such sorrow can find; and if in
such distress words are spoken which should not be justified, yet the
considerate and benevolent will hear them with indulgence. God is
merciful; and the stroke of this people was heavier even than their
groaning.

Put a sword in their hand - Given them a pretense which they had not
before, to oppress us even unto death.

[Exodus 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 5:22</span></span>

And Moses returned unto the Lord - This may imply, either that there was
a particular place into which Moses ordinarily went to commune with
Jehovah; or it may mean that kind of turning of heart and affection to
God, which every pious mind feels itself disposed to practice in any
time or place. The old adage will apply here: "A praying heart never
lacks a praying place." Lord, wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this
people? - It is certain that in this address Moses uses great plainness
of speech. Whether the offspring of a testy impatience and undue
familiarity, or of strong faith which gave him more than ordinary access
to the throne of his gracious Sovereign, it would be difficult to say.
The latter appears to be the most probable, as we do not find, from the
succeeding chapter, that God was displeased with his freedom; we may
therefore suppose that it was kept within due bounds, and that the
principles and motives were all pure and good. However, it should be
noted, that such freedom of speech with the Most High should never be
used but on very special occasions, and then only by his extraordinary
messengers.

[Exodus 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">exo 5:23</span></span>

He hath done evil to this people - Their misery is increased instead of
being diminished.

Neither hast thou delivered thy people at all - The marginal reading is
both literal and correct: And delivering thou hast not delivered. Thou
hast begun the work by giving us counsels and a commission, but thou
hast not brought the people from under their bondage. Thou hast
signified thy pleasure relative to their deliverance, but thou hast not
brought them out of the hands of their enemies.

1\. It is no certain proof of the displeasure of God that a whole
people, or an individual, may be found in a state of great oppression
and distress; nor are affluence and prosperity any certain signs of his
approbation. God certainly loved the Israelites better than he did the
Egyptians; yet the former were in the deepest adversity, while the
latter were in the height of prosperity. Luther once observed, that if
secular prosperity were to be considered as a criterion of the Divine
approbation, then the grand Turk must be the highest in the favor of
God, as he was at that time the most prosperous sovereign on the earth.
An observation of this kind, on a case so obvious, was really well
calculated to repress hasty conclusions drawn from these external
states, and to lay down a correct rule of judgment for all such
occasions.

2\. In all our addresses to God we should ever remember that we have
sinned against him, and deserve nothing but punishment from his hand. We
should therefore bow before him with the deepest humiliation of soul,
and take that caution of the wise man, "Be not rash with thy mouth, and
let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God; for God is
in heaven, and thou upon earth; therefore let thy words be few," [Ecc
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#002.md). There is the more need to attend
to this caution, because many ignorant though well-meaning people use
very improper, not to say indecent, freedoms in their addresses to the
throne of grace. With such proceedings God cannot be well pleased; and
he who has not a proper impression of the dignity and excellence of the
Divine Nature, is not in such a disposition as it is essentially
necessary to feel in order to receive help from God. He who knows he has
sinned, and feels that he is less than the least of all God's mercies,
will pray with the deepest humility, and even rejoice before God with
trembling. A solemn Awe of the Divine Majesty is not less requisite to
successful praying, than faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. When we have
such a commission as that of Moses, we may make use of his freedom of
speech; but till then, the publican's prayer will best suit the
generality of those who are even dignified by the name of Christian -
Lord, be merciful to me, a Sinner!
