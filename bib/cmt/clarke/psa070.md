### [Psalms Chapter 70](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 70:0</span></span>

The psalmist prays for speedy deliverance, [Psa
70:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#001.md); prays against those who sought
his life, [Psa 70:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#002.md), [Psa
70:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#003.md); and for the blessedness of those
who sought God, [Psa 70:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#004.md); urges his
speedy deliverance, [Psa 70:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#005.md).

The title in the Hebrew is, To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David, to
bring to remembranee. There seems little sense in this title. It seems
to intimate that the Psalm was written as a memorial that David had been
in sore affliction, and that God had delivered him. So the Vulgate,
Septuagint, Ethiopic, and Arabic. It is almost word for word the same
with the five last verses of Psalm 40, to the notes on which the reader
is referred.

[Psalms 70:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 70:1</span></span>

Make haste to help me - I am in extreme distress, and the most imminent
danger. Haste to help me, or I am lost.

[Psalms 70:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 70:2</span></span>

Let them be turned backward - They are coming in a body against me.
Lord, stop their progress!

[Psalms 70:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 70:3</span></span>

That say, Aha, aha - האה האה Heach! heach! a note of supreme contempt.
See on [Psa 40:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#015) (note.md).

[Psalms 70:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 70:4</span></span>

Let God be magnified - Let his glory, mercy, and kindness, continually
appear in the increase of his own work in the souls of his followers!

[Psalms 70:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 70:5</span></span>

But I am poor and needy - עני ואביון ani veebyon, I am a poor man, and a
beggar - an afflicted beggar; a sense of my poverty causes me to beg.

Thou art my help - I know thou hast enough, and to spare; and therefore
I come to thee.

Make no tarrying - My wants are many, my danger great, my time short. O
God, delay not!
