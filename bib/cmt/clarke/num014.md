### [Numbers Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#001)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 14:0</span></span>

The whole congregation weep at the account brought by the spies, [Num
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#001). They murmur, [Num
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#002), [Num
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#003); and propose to make themselves a
captain, and go back to Egypt, [Num
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#004). Moses and Aaron are greatly
affected, [Num 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#005). Joshua and Caleb
endeavor to appease and encourage the people, [Num
14:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#006). The congregation are about to
stone them, [Num 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#010). The glory of
the Lord appears, and he is about to smite the rebels with the
pestilence, [Num 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#011), [Num
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#012). Moses makes a long and pathetic
intercession in their behalf, [Num
14:13-19](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#013). The Lord hears and forbears
to punish, [Num 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#020); but purposes
that not one of that generation shall enter into the promised land save
Joshua and Caleb, [Num 14:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#021). Moses
is commanded to turn and get into the wilderness by way of the Red Sea,
[Num 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#025). The Lord repeats his
purpose that none of that generation shall enter into the promised land
- that their carcasses shall fall in the wilderness, and that their
children alone, with Joshua and Caleb, shall possess the land of the
Canaanites, etc., [Num 14:26-32](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#026). As
many days as they have searched the land shall they wander years in the
desert, until they shall be utterly consumed, [Num
14:33-35](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#033). All the spies save Joshua
and Caleb die by a plague, [Num
14:36-38](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#036). Moses declares God's purpose
to the people, at which they are greatly affected, [Num
14:39](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#039). They acknowledge their sin, and
purpose to go up at once and possess the land, [Num
14:40](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#040). Moses cautions them against
resisting the purpose of God, [Num
14:41-43](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#041). They, notwithstanding,
presume to go, but Moses and the ark abide in the camp, [Num
14:44](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#044). The Amalekites and Canaanites
come down from the mountains, and defeat them, [Num
14:45](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#045).

[Numbers 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 14:1</span></span>

Cried; and - wept that night - In almost every case this people gave
deplorable evidence of the degraded state of their minds. With scarcely
any mental firmness, and with almost no religion, they could bear no
reverses, and were ever at their wit's end. They were headstrong,
presumptuous, pusillanimous, indecisive, and fickle. And because they
were such, therefore the power and wisdom of God appeared the more
conspicuously in the whole of their history.

[Numbers 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 14:4</span></span>

Let us make a captain - Here was a formal renunciation of the authority
of Moses, and flat rebellion against God. And it seems from [Neh
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#017) that they had actually appointed
another leader, under whose direction they were about to return to
Egypt. How astonishing is this! Their lives were made bitter, because of
the rigor with which they were made to serve in the land of Egypt; and
yet they are willing, yea eager, to get back into the same circumstances
again! Great evils, when once some time past, affect the mind less than
present ills, though much inferior. They had partly forgot their
Egyptian bondage, and now smart under a little discouragement, having
totally lost sight of their high calling, and of the power and goodness
of God.

[Numbers 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 14:6</span></span>

And Joshua, etc. - See on [Num 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#033)
(note).

[Numbers 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 14:9</span></span>

Their defense - צלם tsillam, their shadow, a metaphor highly expressive
of protection and support in the sultry eastern countries. The
protection of God is so called; see [Psa
91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001); [Psa
121:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#005); see also [Isa
51:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#016); [Isa
49:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#002); [Isa
30:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#002).

The Arabs and Persians have the same word to express the same thing.

nemayeed zulli doulet mamdood bad.

"May the shadow of thy prosperity be extended!"

nemayced zulli doulet ber mufareki khayr khwahen mamdood bad.

"May the shadow of thy prosperity be spread over the heads of thy
well-wishers!"

They have also the following elegant distich: -

Sayahat kem mubad az seri ma

Bast Allah zullikem abeda.

"May thy protection never be removed from my head!

May God extend thy shadow eternally!"

Here the Arabic zull answers exactly to the Hebrew צל tsel, both
signifying that which overspreads or overshadows. See the note on [Num
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#014).

[Numbers 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 14:10</span></span>

The glory of the Lord appeared - This timely appearance of the Divine
glory prevented these faithful servants of God from being stoned to
death by this base and treacherous multitude. "Every man is immortal
till his work is done," while in simplicity of heart he is following his
God.

[Numbers 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">num 14:14</span></span>

That thy cloud standeth over them - This cloud, the symbol of the Divine
glory, and proof of the Divine presence, appears to have assumed three
different forms for three important purposes.

1\. It appeared by day in the form of a pillar of a sufficient height to
be seen by all the camp, and thus went before them to point out their
way in the desert. [Exo 40:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#038).

2\. It appeared by night as a pillar of fire to give them light while
travelling by night, which they probably sometimes did; (see [Num
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#021)); or to illuminate their tents in
their encampment; [Exo 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021), [Exo
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#022).

3\. It stood at certain times above the whole congregation,
overshadowing them from the scorching rays of the sun; and probably at
other times condensed the vapours, and precipitated rain or dew for the
refreshment of the people. He spread a cloud for their covering; and
fire to give light in the night; [Psa
105:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#039). It was probably from this
circumstance that the shadow of the Lord was used to signify the Divine
protection, not only by the Jews, but also by other Asiatic nations. See
the note on [Num 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#009), and see
particularly the note on [Exo 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021)
(note).

[Numbers 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">num 14:18</span></span>

The Lord is longsuffering - See the note on [Exo
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006).

[Numbers 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">num 14:19</span></span>

Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people - From [Num
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#013) to [Num
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#019) inclusive we have the words of
Moses's intercession; they need no explanation, they are full of
simplicity and energy; his arguments with God (for be did reason and
argue with his Maker) are pointed, cogent, and respectful; and while
they show a heart full of humanity, they evidence the deepest concern
for the glory of God. The argumentum ad hominem is here used in the most
unexceptionable manner, and with the fullest effect.

[Numbers 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 14:20</span></span>

I have pardoned - That is, They shall not be cut off as they deserve,
because thou hast interceded for their lives.

[Numbers 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 14:21</span></span>

All the earth shall be filled, etc. - כל הארץ kol haarets, all This
land, i. e., the land of Canaan which was only fulfilled to the letter
when the preaching of Christ and his apostles was heard through all the
cities and villages of Judea. It does not appear that the whole of the
terraqueous globe is meant by this expression in any of the places where
it occurs connected with this promise of the diffusion of the Divine
light. See [Psa 72:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#019); [Isa
40:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#005); [Hab
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#014).

[Numbers 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">num 14:24</span></span>

But my servant Caleb, etc. - Caleb had another spirit - not only a bold,
generous, courageous, noble, and heroic spirit; but the Spirit and
influence of the God of heaven thus raised him above human inquietudes
and earthly fears, therefore be followed God fully; וימלא אחרי vaimalle
acharai, literally, he filled after me: God showed him the way he was to
take, and the line of conduct he was to pursue, and he filled up this
line, and in all things followed the will of his Maker. He therefore
shall see the promised land, and his seed shall possess it. A dastardly
spirit in the things of God is a heavy curse. How many are retarded in
their course, and fall short of the blessings of the Gospel, through
magnifying the number and strength of their adversaries, their own
weakness and the difficulties of the way, with which we may connect
their distrust of the power, faithfulness, and goodness of God! And how
many are prevented from receiving the higher degrees of salvation by
foolishly attributing insurmountable power, either to their inward
corruptions or outward enemies! Only such men as Joshua and Caleb, who
take God at his word, and who know that against his wisdom no cunning
can stand, and against his might no strength can prevail, are likely to
follow God fully, and receive the heights, lengths, breadths, and depths
of the salvation of God.

[Numbers 14:34](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">num 14:34</span></span>

After the number of the days - The spies were forty days in searching
the land, and the people who rebelled on their evil report are condemned
to wander forty years in the wilderness! Now let them make them a
captain and go back to Egypt if they can. God had so hedged them about
with his power and providence that they could neither go back to Egypt
nor get forward to the promised land! God has provided innumerable
spiritual blessings for mankind, but in the pursuit of earthly good they
lose them, and often lose the others also! If ye be willing and
obedient, ye shall eat the fruit of the land, but not otherwise; unless
for your farther punishment God give you your portion in this life, and
ye get none in the life to come. From so great a curse may God save
thee, thou money-loving, honor-hunting, pleasure-taking, thoughtless,
godless man!

And ye shall know my breach of promise - This is certainly a most harsh
expression; and most learned men agree that the words את תנואתי eth
tenuathi should be translated my vengeance, which is the rendering of
the Septuagint, Vulgate, Coptic, and Anglo-Saxon, and which is followed
by almost all our ancient English translations. The meaning however
appears to be this: As God had promised to bring them into the good
land, provided they kept his statutes, ordinances, etc., and they had
now broken their engagements, he was no longer held by his covenant; and
therefore, by excluding them from the promised land, he showed them at
once his annulling of the covenant which they had broken, and his
vengeance because they had broken it.

[Numbers 14:37](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">num 14:37</span></span>

Those men that did bring up the evil report died - Thus ten of the
twelve that searched out the land were struck dead, by the justice of
God, on the spot! Caleb, of the tribe of Judah, and Joshua, of the tribe
of Ephraim, alone escaped, because they had followed God fully. Let
preachers of God's word take heed how they straiten the way of
salvation, or render, by unjust description, that way perplexed and
difficult which God has made plain and easy.

[Numbers 14:40](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">num 14:40</span></span>

We - will go up unto the place, etc. - They found themselves on the very
borders of the land, and they heard God say they should not enter it,
but should be consumed by a forty years' wandering in the wilderness;
notwithstanding, they are determined to render vain this purpose of God,
probably supposing that the temporary sorrow they felt for their late
rebellion would be accepted as a sufficient atonement for their crimes.
They accordingly went up, and were cut down by their enemies; and why?
God went not with them. How vain is the counsel of man against the
wisdom of God! Nature, poor, fallen human nature, is ever running into
extremes. This miserable people, a short time ago, thought that though
they had Omnipotence with them they could not conquer and possess the
land! Now they imagine that though God himself go not with them, yet
they shall be sufficient to drive out the inhabitants, and take
possession of their country! Man is ever supposing he can either do all
things or do nothing; he is therefore sometimes presumptuous, and at
other times in despair. Who but an apostle, or one under the influence
of the same Spirit, can say, I can do All Things Through Christ who
strengtheneth me?
