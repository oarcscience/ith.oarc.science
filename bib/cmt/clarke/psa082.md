### [Psalms Chapter 82](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 82:0</span></span>

A warning to corrupt judges, [Psa
82:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#001.md), [Psa
82:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#002.md); an exhortation to them to
dispense justice without respect of person, [Psa
82:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#003.md); they are threatened with the
judgments of the Lord, [Psa 82:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#006.md).

This Psalm, which, in the title, is attributed to Asaph, was probably
composed in the time when Jehoshaphat reformed the courts of justice
throughout his states; see [Ch2 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#006.md),
[Ch2 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#007.md), where he uses nearly the
same words as in the beginning of this Psalm.

[Psalms 82:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 82:1</span></span>

God standeth in the congregation of the mighty - The Hebrew should be
translated, "God standeth in the assembly of God." God is among his
people; and he presides especially in those courts of justice which
himself has established. The Court of King's Bench is properly the place
where the king presides, and where he is supposed to be always present.
But the kings of England seldom make their appearance there. King James
I sometimes attended: at such times it might be said, "The king is in
the king's court." I believe the case above to be similar. Judges!
beware what you do! God is in his court, and in the midst (of the
assembly) God will judge. See Parkhurst under אלה.

[Psalms 82:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 82:2</span></span>

Accept the persons of the wicked? - "Lift up their faces," encourage
them in their oppressions.

Selah - "Mark this:" ye do it, and sorely sLall ye suffer for it.

[Psalms 82:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 82:3</span></span>

Defend the poor - You are their natural protectors under God. They are
oppressed: punish their oppressors, however rich or powerful: and
deliver them.

[Psalms 82:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 82:5</span></span>

They know not - The judges are not acquainted with the law of God, on
which all their decisions should be founded.

Neither will they understand - They are ignorant and do not wish to be
instructed. They will not learn; they cannot teach. Happy England! How
different from Judea, even in the days of Jehoshaphat! All thy judges
are learned, righteous, and impartial. Never did greater men in their
profession dignify any land or country - (1822).

All the foundations of the earth - "All the civil institutions of the
land totter." Justice is at the head of all the institutions in a well
regulated state: when that gets poisoned or perverted, every evil,
political and domestic, must prevail; even religion itself ceases to
have any influence.

[Psalms 82:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 82:6</span></span>

Ye are gods - Or, with the prefix of כ ke, the particle of similitude,
כאלהים keelohim, "like God." Ye are my representatives, and are clothed
with my power and authority to dispense judgment and justice, therefore
all of them are said to be children of the Most High.

[Psalms 82:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 82:7</span></span>

But ye shall die like men - כאדם keadam, "ye shall die like Adam," who
fell from his high perfection and dignity as ye have done. Your high
office cannot secure you an immortality.

And fall like one of the princes - Justice shall pursue you, and
judgment shall overtake you; and you shall be executed like public state
criminals. You shall not, in the course of nature, fall into the grave;
but your life shall be brought to an end by a legal sentence, or a
particular judgment of God.

[Psalms 82:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 82:8</span></span>

Arise, O God, judge the earth - Justice is perverted in the land: take
the scepter, and rule thyself.

For thou shalt inherit all nations - Does not this last verse contain a
prophecy of our Lord, the calling of the Gentiles, and the prevalence of
Christianity over the earth? Thus several of the fathers have understood
the passage. It is only by the universal spread of Christianity over the
world, that the reign of righteousness and justice is to be established:
and of whom can it be said that he shall inherit all nations, but of
Jesus Christ?
