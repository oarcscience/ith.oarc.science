[3 Kings (1 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg1 2:0</span></span>

David leaves his dying charge with Solomon, relative to his own personal
conduct, [Kg1 2:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#001.md); to Joab, [Kg1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#005.md), [Kg1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#006.md); to Barzillai, [Kg1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#007.md); to Shimei, [Kg1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#008.md), [Kg1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#009.md). He dies, and Solomon is
established in the kingdom, [Kg1
2:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#010.md). Adonijah requests to have
Abishag to wife, and is put to death by Solomon, [Kg1
2:13-25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#013.md). Abiathar the priest is
banished to his estate at Anathoth, [Kg1
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#026.md), [Kg1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#027.md). Joab, fearing for his life,
flees to the horns of the altar, and is slain there by Benaiah, [Kg1
2:28-34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#028.md). Benaiah is made captain of
the host in his stead, [Kg1 2:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#035.md).
Shimei is ordered to confine himself to Jerusalem, and never leave it on
pain of death, [Kg1 2:36-38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#036.md). After
three years he follows some of his runaway servants to Gath, and thereby
forfeits his life, [Kg1 2:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#039.md), [Kg1
2:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#040.md). Solomon sends for him, upbraids
him, and commands him to be slain by Benaiah, [Kg1
2:41-46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#041.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 2:2</span></span>

I go the way of all the earth - I am dying. All the inhabitants of the
earth must come to the dust. In life, some follow one occupation, some
another; but all must, sooner or later, come to the grave. Death is no
respecter of persons; he visits the palace of the king as well as the
cottage of the peasant.

Pallida mors aequo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas,

Regumque turres. -

Hor. Odar. lib. i., od. iv., ver. 13.

"With equal pace, impartial fate

Knocks at the palace as the cottage gate."

Francis.

\- Sed omnes una manet nox,

Et calcanda semel via lethi. -

Ib. od. xxviii., ver. 15.

"One dreary night for all mankind remains,

And once we all must tread the shadowy plains."

Ibid.

There is no respect to age or youth more than to station or external
circumstance: -

Mixta senum ac juvenum densantur funera: nullum

Saeva caput Proserpina fugit.

Ib. od. xxviii., ver. 19.

Thus age and youth promiscuous crowd the tomb;

No mortal head can shun the impending doom."

Ibid.

And it is not merely man that is subjected to this necessity; all that
have in them the breath of life must lose it; it is the way of all the
earth, both of men and inferior animals.

\- Terrestria quando Mortales animas vivunt sortita,

neque ulla est Aut parvo aut magno lethi fuga.

Vive memor quam sis aevi brevis.

Hor. Sat. l. ii., s. vi., ver. 93.

"All that tread the earth are subject to mortality;

neither great nor small can avoid death.

Live therefore conscious that your time is short."

It is painful to the pride of the great and mighty that, however
decorated their tombs may be, they must undergo the same dissolution and
corruption with the vulgar dead; for the grave is the house appointed
for all living: man is born to die.

Omnium idem exitus est, sed et idem domicilium.

"For all have the same end, and are huddled together in the same narrow
house."

Here emperors, kings, statesmen, warriors, heroes, and butchers of all
kinds, with peasants and beggars, meet; however various their routes,
they terminate in the same point. This and all other kindred sentiments
on the subject are well expressed in that excellent little poem of Mr.
Blair, entitled "The Grave," which opens with the following lines: -

While some affect the sun, and some the shade; Some flee the city, some
the hermitage; Their aims as various as the roads they take In
journeying through life; the task be mine To paint the gloomy horrors of
the tomb, The appointed place of rendezvous, where all These travelers
meet.

Show thyself a man - Act like a rational being, and not like a brute;
and remember, that he acts most like a man who is most devoted to his
Good.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 2:3</span></span>

Keep the charge of the Lord - Keep what God has given thee to keep.

1\. Walk in his ways. Not in thine own, nor in the ways of a wicked,
perishing world.

2\. Keep his statutes. Consider all his appointments to be holy, just,
and good; receive them as such, and conscientiously observe them.

3\. Keep his commandments. Whatever he has bidden thee to do, perform;
what he has forbidden thee to do, omit.

4\. Keep his judgments. What he has determined to be right, is
essentially and inherently right; what he has determined to be wrong or
evil, is inherently and essentially so. A thing is not good because God
has commanded it; a thing is not evil because he has forbidden it. He
has commanded the good, because it is in its own nature good and useful;
he has forbidden the evil, because it is in its own nature bad and
hurtful. Keep therefore his judgments.

5\. Keep his testimonies. Bear witness to all to which he has borne
witness. His testimonies are true; there is no deceit or falsity in
them. His testimonies refer also to future good things and good times;
they are the significators of coming blessedness: as such, respect them.

That thou mayest prosper - If thou hast God's approbation, thou wilt
have God's blessing. If thy ways please him, he will not withhold from
thee any manner of thing that is good.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 2:4</span></span>

That the Lord may continue his word - The prosperity which God has
promised to grant to my family will depend on their faithfulness to the
good they receive; if they live to God, they shall sit for ever on the
throne of Israel. But alas! they did not; and God's justice cut off the
entail made by his mercy.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 2:5</span></span>

Thou knowest - what Joab - did to me - He did every thing bad and
dishonorable in itself, in the murder of Abner and Amasa, and indeed in
the death of the profligate Absalom.

Shed the blood of war - upon his girdle - and in his shoes - He stabbed
them while he pretended to embrace them, so that their blood gushed out
on his girdle, and fell into his shoes! This was a most abominable
aggravation of his crimes.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 2:6</span></span>

Let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace - It would have been
an insult to justice not to have taken the life of Joab. David was
culpable in delaying it so long; but probably the circumstances of his
government would not admit of his doing it sooner. According to the law
of God, Joab, having murdered Abner and Amasa, should die. And had not
David commanded Solomon to perform this act of justice, he could not
have died in the approbation of his Maker.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 2:7</span></span>

But show kindness unto the sons of Barzillai - See the notes on [Sa2
19:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#031) (note.md), etc.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 2:8</span></span>

Thou hast with thee Shimei - See on [Sa2
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#005) (note.md), etc., and the notes on
[Sa2 19:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#018) (note.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 2:9</span></span>

Hold him not guiltless - Do not consider him as an innocent man, though
I have sworn to him that I would not put him to death by the sword; yet
as thou art a wise man, and knowest how to treat such persons, treat him
as he deserves; only as I have sworn to him, and he is an aged man, let
him not die a violent death; bring not down his hoary head to the grave
with blood. So Solomon understood David, and so I think David should be
understood; for the negative particle לא lo, in the former clause, hold
him Not guiltless, should be repeated in this latter clause, though not
expressed, his hoary head bring thou Not down; instances of which
frequently occur in the Hebrew Bible. See Dr. Kennicott's note at the
end of this chapter, [Kg1 2:46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#046) (note.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 2:10</span></span>

David slept with his fathers - His life was a life of remarkable
providences, of much piety, and of great public usefulness. In general
he lived well, and it is most evident that he died well; and as a king,
a general, a poet, a father, and a friend, he has had few equals, and no
superior, from his own time to the present day. But I shall reserve a
more particular consideration of his character till I come to the book
of Psalms, in which that character, with all its lights and shades, is
exhibited by his own masterly hand. And it is from this composition
alone that we can know David, and the maxims by which he was governed in
public and private life.

Was buried in the city of David - And Solomon, says Josephus, deposited
immense treasures with him, in the grave, where they continued
unmolested for thirteen hundred years, till Hyrcanus, the high priest,
being besieged by Antiochus, opened the sepulcher, and took thence three
thousand talents, part of which he gave to Antiochus, to raise the
siege. It is added that, many years afterwards, Herod the Great
ransacked this tomb and got considerable riches. Little credit is due to
this account, though we know that was customary in ancient times to
deposit with the more illustrious dead, gold, silver, and precious
stones. That the tomb of David existed in the days of the apostles, we
learn from [Act 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#029.md), where St. Peter,
addressing the Jews, says, Men and brethren, let me speak freely to you
of the patriarch David; that he is both dead and buried, and his
sepulcher is with us unto this day. St. Jerome speaks of it as existing
in his time, and modern travelers pretend that it is still in existence.
But both monks and Mohammedans have long united to impose on Christian
pilgrims; and there is scarcely any dependence to be placed on any of
their relations; absurdity and self-contradiction are their principal
characteristics.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 2:15</span></span>

Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine - It certainly was his by the
right of primogeniture, and it was his by the voice of the people, and
the consent of the high priest. But there was a right paramount to all
these, the right of God; it was his kingdom; the kings were his
lieutenants, and he had a right to give the crown to whomsoever he
pleased, and he was pleased to give it to Solomon.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 2:17</span></span>

That he give me Abishag - to wife - He cheerfully gives up all right to
the kingdom, and only desires to have this young woman, who, though she
had been his father's wife or concubine, was still in a state of
virginity. Some think that Joab and Abiathar had advised Adonijah to
make this application, not doubting, if he got Abishag, that the popular
tide would again turn in his favor, and that Solomon, whom they did not
like, might soon be deposed; and that it was on this account that
Solomon was so severe. But there is little evidence to support these
conjectures. It does not appear that Adonijah by desiring to have
Abishag had any thought of the kingdom, or of maintaining any right to
it, though Solomon appears to have understood him in this sense. But
without farther evidence, this was a flimsy pretext to imbrue his hands
in a brother's blood. The fable of the wolf and lamb is here very
applicable, and the old English proverb not less so: It is an easy thing
to find a staff to beat a dog with. We readily find an excuse for
whatever we are determined to do. He who attempts to varnish over this
conduct of Solomon by either state necessity or a Divine command, is an
enemy, in my mind, to the cause of God and truth. See on [Kg1
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#025) (note.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 2:25</span></span>

Solomon sent - Benaiah - and he fell upon him that he died. - Benaiah
seems to have been the public state executioner, and yet he was
generalissimo of all the forces. See him employed in a similar work,
[Kg1 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#034) (note.md), [Kg1
2:46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#046) (note.md). I suppose him to have
been such another general as Suwarrow, butcher-general of the Turks and
Poles to the late Empress Catharine of Russia: like mistress, like man.
But they have long since been called to an impartial tribunal.

That this was an act of cruelty towards Adonijah, needs no proof. He is
suspected, condemned, and slain, without a hearing. Calmet vindicates
all this by various assumptions, and lays down a doctrine that is
calculated for the meridian of Fez or Morocco; hear him: Un prince, dans
ses jugemens, ne peut pas toujours suivre les regles de la plus parfaite
morale; la politique, et le bien de l'etat, obligent souvent a des
choses opposees aux conseils de l'evangile; "A prince in his judgments
cannot always follow the rules of the most perfect morality; policy and
the good of the state often require things to be done which are contrary
to the counsels of the Gospel." What a diabolic maxim is this! And is
this indeed the way that French kings ruled and ministers decreed
judgment? Then we need not wonder at a revolution in that state, nor of
the scourge that desolated the land. O England! magnify God for your
constitution, your constitutional king, and the laws according to which
he reigns.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 2:27</span></span>

So Solomon thrust out Abiathar - This was for having taken part before
with Adonijah, but by it a remarkable prophecy was fulfilled; see 1
Samuel 2:13-35 (note), and the notes there. God had told Eli that the
priesthood should depart from his house; Abiathar was the last of the
descendants of Ithamar, of which family was Eli the high priest. Zadok,
who was made priest in the stead of Abiathar, was of the family of
Eliezer; and by this change the priesthood reverted to its ancient
channel. Abiathar deserved this degradation; he supported Adonijah in
his unnatural assumption of the royal dignity, even during the life of
his father. This was the head and front of his offending.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 2:28</span></span>

Tidings came to Joab - He heard that Adonijah had been slain and
Abiathar banished, and probably he had heard of David's dying charge to
Solomon. Fearing therefore for his personal safety, he takes refuge at
the tabernacle, as claiming Divine protection, and desiring to have his
case decided by God alone; or perhaps a spark of remorse is now kindled;
and, knowing that he must die, he wishes to die in the house of God, as
it were under the shadow, that he might receive the mercy of the
Almighty.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg1 2:30</span></span>

Nay; but I will die here - The altars were so sacred among all the
people, that, in general, even the vilest wretch found safety, if he
once reached the altar. This led to many abuses, and the perversion of
public justice; and at last it became a maxim that the guilty should be
punished, should they even have taken refuge at the altars. God decreed
that the presumptuous murderer who had taken refuge at the altar should
be dragged thence, and put to death; see [Exo
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#014.md). The heathens had the same kind
of ordinance; hence Euripides: -

Εγω γαρ ὁστις μη δικαιος ων ανηρ

Βωμον προσιζει, τον νομον χαιρειν εων,

Προς την δικην αγοιμ' αν, αυ τρεσας θεους·

Κακον γαρ ανδρα χρη κακως πασχειν αει.

Euripid. Frag. 42. Edit. Musg.

"If an unrighteous man, availing himself of the law, should claim the
protection of the altar, I would drag him to justice, nor fear the wrath
of the gods; for it is necessary that every wicked man should suffer for
his crimes."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg1 2:34</span></span>

So Benaiah - went up - and slew him - It appears he slew him at the very
altar. Joab must have been both old and infirm at this time, and now he
bleeds for Abner, he bleeds for Amasa, and he bleeds for Uriah. The two
former he murdered; of the blood of the latter he was not innocent; yet
he had done the state much service, and they knew it. But he was a
murderer, and vengeance would not suffer such to live.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">kg1 2:36</span></span>

Build thee a house - Thus he gave him the whole city for a prison, and
this certainly could have reduced him to no hardships.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">kg1 2:37</span></span>

Thy blood shall be upon thine own head - Thou knowest what to expect; if
thou disobey my orders thou shalt certainly be slain, and then thou
shalt be considered as a self-murderer; thou alone shalt be answerable
for thy own death. Solomon knew that Shimei was a seditious man, and he
chose to keep him under his own eye; for such a man at large, in
favorable circumstances, might do much evil. His bitter revilings of
David were a sufficient proof.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">kg1 2:40</span></span>

And Shimei - went to Gath - It is astonishing that with his eyes wide
open he would thus run into the jaws of death.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:45](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">kg1 2:45</span></span>

King Solomon shall be blessed - He seems to think that, while such bad
men remained unpunished, the nation could not prosper; that it was an
act of justice which God required him to perform, in order to the
establishment and perpetuity of his throne.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">kg1 2:46</span></span>

And the kingdom was established - He had neither foes within nor
without. He was either dreaded or loved universally. His own subjects
were affectionately bound to him, and the surrounding nations did not
think proper to make him their enemy.

As there are serious doubts relative to the dying charge of David as it
relates to Shimei, most believing that, in opposition to his own oath,
David desired that Solomon should put him to death; I shall here insert
Dr. Kennicott's criticism on this part of the text: -

"David is here represented in our English version as finishing his life
with giving a command to Solomon to kill Shimei, and to kill him on
account of that very crime for which, as David here says, he had sworn
to him by the Lord he would not put him to death. The behavior thus
imputed to the king and prophet, and which would be justly censurable if
true, should be examined very carefully as to the ground it stands upon;
and when the passage is duly considered, I presume it will appear highly
probable that an injury has been here done to this illustrious
character. The point to which I now beg the reader's attention is this:
That it is not uncommon in the Hebrew language to omit the negative in a
second part of the sentence, and to consider it as repeated, when it has
been once expressed, and is followed by the connecting particle. And
thus on [Isa 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#022.md) the late learned
annotator says: 'The negative is repeated or referred to by the
conjunction vau, as in many other places.' So also [Isa
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#004.md). The necessity of so very
considerable an alteration as inserting the particle Not, may be here
confirmed by some other instances. [Psa
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#005.md) : The ungodly shall not stand in
the judgment, Nor (the Hebrew is And, signifying and not) sinners in the
congregation of the righteous. [Psa
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#018.md) : The needy shall not alway be
forgotten, (and then the negative, understood as repeated by the
conjunction, now dropped), the expectation of the poor shall (Not)
perish for ever. [Psa 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#001.md) : O Lord,
rebuke me not in thy wrath; Neither (And, for and not) chasten me in thy
hot displeasure. [Psa 75:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#005.md) : Lift not
up your horn on high, (and then the negative, understood as repeated by
the conjunction, now dropped), speak (Not) with a stiff neck. [Pro
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#012), (our version is this.md): Doth not
he, that pondereth the heart consider it? and he that keepeth the soul,
doth (Not) he know it? and shall (Not) he render to every man according
to his works? And [Pro 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#003.md) : I
neither learned wisdom, Nor (And, for and not) have the knowledge of the
holy. If then there are in fact many such instances, the question is,
Whether the negative here, expressed in the former part of David's
command, may not be understood as to be repeated in the latter part; and
if this may be, a strong reason will be added why it should be, so
interpreted. The passage will run thus: 'Behold, thou hast with thee
Shimei, who cursed me - but I swore to him by the Lord, saying, I will
not put thee to death by the sword. Now, therefore, hold him Not
guiltless, (for thou art a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to
do unto him), but bring Not down his hoar head to the grave with blood.'
Now if the language itself will admit of this construction, the sense
thus given to the sentence derives a very strong support from the
context. For how did Solomon understand this charge? Did he kill Shimei
in consequence of it? Certainly he did not; for after he had immediately
commanded Joab to be slain, in obedience to his father, he sends for
Shimei, and knowing that Shimei ought to be well watched, confines him
to a particular spot in Jerusalem for the remainder of his life; [Kg1
2:36-42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#036.md). See also [Job
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#017.md); [Job
30:20](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#020.md); [Job
31:20](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#020.md)." This is the best mode of
interpreting this text.
