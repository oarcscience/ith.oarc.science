### [2 Timothy Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#001.md)

[2 Timothy](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ti2 4:0</span></span>

The apostle charges Timothy to be diligent, incessant, and faithful in
his preaching; to watch, suffer patiently, and give full proof of his
ministry, [Ti2 4:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#001.md). He predicts his
own approaching death, and expresses the strongest confidence of being
eternally happy, [Ti2 4:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#006.md). Desires
Timothy to come and see him; shows that several had forsaken him, that
others were gone to different districts, and that he had only Luke with
him, [Ti2 4:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#009.md). Desires him to bring
the cloak, book, and parchments, which he had left at Troas, [Ti2
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#013.md). Of Alexander the coppersmith's
opposition, [Ti2 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#014.md), [Ti2
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#015.md). Tells Timothy how he was
deserted by all when obliged to make his first defense before Nero; how
God supported him, and the confidence with which he was inspired, [Ti2
4:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#016.md). Salutations to different
persons at Ephesus, and from different persons at Rome, [Ti2
4:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#019.md). The apostolical benediction,
[Ti2 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#022.md).

[2 Timothy 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti2 4:1</span></span>

I charge thee therefore before God - Whose herald thou art; and before
the Lord Jesus Christ, whose salvation thou art to proclaim, and who is
coming to judge the world - all that shall be found then alive, and all
that have died from the foundation of the world.

[2 Timothy 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ti2 4:2</span></span>

Preach the word - Κηρυξον τον λογον· Proclaim the doctrine, the doctrine
of Christ crucified, for the sins of the whole world; the doctrine, that
the Gentiles are invited to be fellow heirs with the Jews, and that for
Jews and Gentiles there is no salvation but by faith in Christ.

Be instant in season, out of season - Επιστηθι ευκαιρως, ακαιρως. Be
urgent whether the times be prosperous or adverse, whenever there is an
opportunity; and when there is none, strive to make one. The Judge is at
the door, and to every man eternity is at hand! Wherever thou meetest a
sinner, speak to him the word of reconciliation. Do not be contented
with stated times and accustomed places merely; all time and place
belong to God, and are proper for his work. Wherever it can be done,
there it should be done. Satan will omit neither time nor place where he
can destroy. Omit thou none where thou mayest be the instrument of
salvation to any.

Reprove - Ελεγξον· Confute, the false teacher.

Rebuke - Επιτιμησον· Reprove cuttingly and severely those who will not
abandon their sins.

Exhort - Παρακαλεσον· Comfort the feeble-minded, the diffident and the
tempted.

With all long-suffering - In reference to each and all of these cases.

And doctrine - The different modes of teaching suited to each.

[2 Timothy 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ti2 4:3</span></span>

For the time will come - There is a time coming to the Church when men
will not hear the practical truths of the Gospel, when they will prefer
speculative opinions, which either do no good to the soul, or corrupt
and destroy it, to that wholesome doctrine of "deny thyself, take up thy
cross and follow me," which Jesus Christ has left in his Church.

But after their own lusts - For these they will follow, and hate those
preachers and that doctrine by which they are opposed.

Shall they heap to themselves teachers - They will add one teacher to
another, run and gad about after all, to find out those who insist not
on the necessity of bearing the cross, of being crucified to the world,
and of having the mind that was in Jesus. In this disposition interested
men often find their account; they set up for teachers, "and widen and
strew with flowers the way, down to eternal ruin," taking care to soothe
the passions and flatter the vices of a trifling, superficial people.

Having itching ears - Endless curiosity, an insatiable desire of
variety; and they get their ears tickled with the language and accent of
the person, abandoning the good and faithful preacher for the fine
speaker.

[2 Timothy 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ti2 4:4</span></span>

And they shall turn away their ears from the truth - The truth strips
them of their vices, sacrifices their idols, darts its lightnings
against their easily besetting sins, and absolutely requires a
conformity to a crucified Christ; therefore they turn their ears away
from it.

And shall be turned unto fables - Believe any kind of stuff and
nonsense; for, as one has justly observed, "Those who reject the truth
are abandoned by the just judgment of God to credit the most degrading
nonsense." This is remarkably the case with most deists; their creed
often exhibits what is grossly absurd.

[2 Timothy 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ti2 4:5</span></span>

But watch thou in all things - It is possible to be overtaken in a
fault, to neglect one's duty, and to lose one's soul. Watching unto
prayer prevents all these evils.

Endure afflictions - Let no sufferings affright thee; nor let the dread
of them either cause thee to abandon the truth, or relax in thy zeal for
the salvation of men.

Do the work of an evangelist - That is: Preach Christ crucified for the
sins of the whole world; for this, and this alone, is doing the work of
an evangelist, or preacher of the glad tidings of peace and salvation by
Christ. An angel from God was first sent to do the work of an
evangelist, and how did he do it? Behold, said he, I bring you good
tidings of great joy; Ιδου γαρ, ευαγγελιζομαι ὑμιν χαραν μεγαλην, ἡτις
εσται παντι τῳ λαῳ. Behold, I evangelize unto you great joy, which shall
be to all people; to you is born a Savior. Those who do not proclaim
Christ as having tasted death for every man, and who do not implicitly
show that every human soul may be saved, do not perform the work of
evangelists; they, God help them! limit the Holy One of Israel. Yet, as
far as they preach the truth in sincerity, so far God acknowledges and
blesses them and their labors; they do a part of the work, but not the
whole.

Make full proof of thy ministry - Push all thy principles to their
utmost power of activity; carry them on to all their consequences; and
try what God will do for thee, and by thee. Neglect no part of thy
sacred function; perform faithfully all the duties of which it is
composed; and do God's work in his own way and in his own spirit.

[2 Timothy 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ti2 4:6</span></span>

For I am now ready to be offered - Ηδη σπενδομαι· I am already poured
out as a libation. See the note on [Phi
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#017.md). He considers himself as on the
eve of being sacrificed, and looks upon his blood as the libation which
was poured on the sacrificial offering. He could not have spoken thus
positively had not the sentence of death been already passed upon him.

[2 Timothy 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ti2 4:7</span></span>

I have fought a good fight - Every reader will perceive that the
apostle, as was his very frequent custom, alludes to the contests at the
Grecian games: Τον αγυνα τον καλον ηγωνισμαι· I have wrestled that good
wrestling - I have struggled hard, and have over come, in a most
honorable cause.

I have finished my course - I have started for the prize, and have come
up to the goal, outstripping all my competitors, and have gained this
prize also.

I have kept the faith - As the laws of these games must be most
diligently observed and kept, (for though a man overcome, yet is he not
crowned, except he strive lawfully), so I have kept the rules of the
spiritual combat and race; and thus, having contended lawfully, and
conquered in each exercise, I have a right to expect the prize.

[2 Timothy 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ti2 4:8</span></span>

Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown - This I can claim as my due;
but the crown I expect is not one of fading leaves, but a crown of
righteousness; the reward which God, in his kindness, has promised to
them who are faithful to the grace he has bestowed upon them.

The Lord, the righteous Judge - He alludes here to the brabeus, or
umpire in the Grecian games, whose office it was to declare the victor,
and to give the crown.

At that day - The day of judgment; the morning of the resurrection from
the dead.

Unto all them also that love his appearing - All who live in expectation
of the coming of Christ, who anticipate it with joyfulness, having
buried the world and laid up all their hopes above. Here is a reward,
but it is a reward not of debt but of grace; for it is by the grace of
God that even an apostle is fitted for glory. And this reward is common
to the faithful; it is given, not only to apostles, but to all them that
love his appearing. This crown is laid up - it is in view, but not in
possession. We must die first.

I have several times noted the allusions of St. Paul to the Greek poets,
and such as seemed to argue that he quoted immediately from them. There
is a passage in the Alcestis of Euripides, in which the very expressions
used here by the apostle are found, and spoken on the occasion of a wife
laying down her life for her husband, when both his parents had refused
to do it.

Ουκ ηθελησας ουδ' ετολμησας θανειν

Του σου προ παιδος· αλλα την δ' ειασατε

Γυναικ' οθνειαν, ἡν εγω και μητερα

Πατερα τε γ' ενδικως αν ἡγοιμην μονην·

Και τοι καλον γ' αν τανδ' αγων' ηγωνισω,

Του σου προ παιδος κατθανων.

Alcest. v. 644.

"Thou wouldst not, neither darest thou to die for thy son; but hast
suffered this strange woman to do it, whom I justly esteem to be alone
my father and mother: thou wouldst have fought a good fight hadst thou
died for thy son."

See Sophocles and Aeschylus, quoted [Ti1
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#015.md).

The καλος αγων, good fight, was used among the Greeks to express a
contest of the most honorable kind, and in this sense the apostle uses
it.

[2 Timothy 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ti2 4:9</span></span>

Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me - He appears to have wished
Timothy to be present at his death, that he might have his faith
confirmed by seeing how a Christian could die; and, as he had but a
short time to live, he begs Timothy to hasten his visit, and
particularly so as he had scarcely now any companions.

[2 Timothy 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ti2 4:10</span></span>

Demas hath forsaken me - This is another proof of the posteriority of
this epistle: for Demas was with the apostle in his first imprisonment,
and joins in the salutations, see [Col
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#014.md), which were written when Paul was
a prisoner at Rome for the first time.

Having loved this present world - Αγαπησας τον νυν αιωνα Having
preferred Judaism to Christianity; or having loved the Jews, and having
sought their welfare in preference to that of the Gentiles.

The עולם הזה words olam hazzeh, which answer to the Greek τον νυν αιωνα,
are generally to be understood as signifying, either the Jewish people,
or the system of Judaism. It was now become doubly dangerous to be a
Christian; and those who had not religion enough to enable them to burn,
or in any other way to expose life for it, took refuge in that religion
which was exposed to no persecution. This is a light in which the
conduct of Demas may be viewed. It could not have been the love of
secular gain which had induced Demas to abandon St. Paul; he must have
counted this cost before he became a Christian. See below.

Crescens to Galatia - Whether the departure of Crescens was similar to
that of Demas, as intimated above, or whether he went on an evangelical
embassy, we know not. Charity would hope the latter; for we can hardly
suppose that Titus, who is here said to have departed to Dalmatia, had
abandoned his Cretan Churches, his apostolical office, and especially
his aged father and friend, now about to seal the truth with his blood!
It is probable that both these persons had gone on sacred missions, and
perhaps had been gone some time before the apostle was brought into such
imminent danger. Even for Demas, as standing in this connection,
something might be said. It is not intimated that he had denied the
faith, but simply that he had left the apostle and gone into
Thessalonica; for which this reason is given, that he loved the present
world. Now, if αγαπησας, having loved, can be applied to a desire to
save the souls of the Jews, and that he went into Thessalonica, where
they abounded, for this very purpose, then we shall find all three -
Demas, Crescens, and Titus, one at Thessalonica, another at Galatia, and
the third at Dalmatia, doing the work of evangelists, visiting the
Churches, and converting both Jews and Gentiles. This interpretation I
leave to the charitable reader, and must own that, with all the
presumptive evidences against it, it has some fair show of probability.
Demas has received little justice from interpreters and preachers in
general. It is even fashionable to hunt him down.

[2 Timothy 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ti2 4:11</span></span>

Only Luke is with me - This was Luke the evangelist, and writer of the
Acts of the Apostles, who was always much attached to St. Paul, and it
is supposed continued with him even to his martyrdom.

Take Mark, and bring him with thee - This was John Mark, the sister's
son of Barnabas, who, after having wavered a little at first, became a
steady, zealous, and useful man; his name and conduct have been often
before the reader. See the parallel passages.

For he is profitable to me for the ministry - Εις διακονιαν· For
service; that is, he would be very useful to the apostle, to minister to
him in his present close confinement. Some think that the apostle means
his preaching the Gospel; but at this time, I should suppose, there was
very little, if any, public preaching at Rome.

[2 Timothy 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ti2 4:12</span></span>

Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus - For this person, see [Act
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004.md); [Eph
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#021.md); [Col
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#007.md). It is rather strange that the
apostle should say, I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus, if Timothy was at
Ephesus at this time; but it is probable that Tychicus had been sent to
Ephesus some time before this, and therefore the apostle might say,
though writing now to Ephesus, Tychicus have I sent, etc.

[2 Timothy 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ti2 4:13</span></span>

The cloak that I left at Troas - Τον φελονην is by several translated
bag or portmanteau; and it is most likely that it was something of this
kind, in which he might carry his clothes, books, and travelling
necessaries. What the books were we cannot tell, it is most likely they
were his own writings; and as to the parchments, they were probably the
Jewish Scriptures and a copy of the Septuagint. These he must have had
at hand at all times. The books and parchments now sent for could not be
for the apostle's own use, as he was now on the eve of his martyrdom. He
had probably intended to bequeath them to the faithful, that they might
be preserved for the use of the Church.

[2 Timothy 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ti2 4:14</span></span>

Alexander the coppersmith - We are not to understand this of any
tradesman, but of some rabbin; for it was not unusual for the Jews to
apply the name of some trade as an epithet to their rabbins and literary
men. He is, in all probability, the very same mentioned [Act
19:33](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#033) (note.md); and it is not unlikely
that he may have been the same whom the apostle was obliged to
excommunicate, [Ti1 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#020.md).

The Lord reward him - Αποδῳη αυτῳ ὁ Κυριος· But instead of αποδῳη, which
has here the power of a solemn imprecation, αποδωσει, he will reward, is
the reading of the very best MSS., several of the versions, and some of
the chief Greek fathers. This makes the sentence declaratory: The Lord
Will reward him according to his works. This reading is most like the
spirit and temper of this heavenly man. See [Ti2
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#016.md).

[2 Timothy 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ti2 4:15</span></span>

Of whom be thou ware also - It seems that this rabbin traveled about
from place to place for the purpose of opposing the Gospel, the Jews
putting him forward, as it is said, [Act
19:33](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#033.md).

He hath greatly withstood our words - Has been a constant opposer of the
Christian doctrines.

[2 Timothy 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ti2 4:16</span></span>

At my first answer - Εν τῃ τρωτῃ μου απολογιᾳ· At my first apology; this
word properly signifies a defense or vindication. To his is the meaning
of what we call the apologies of the primitive fathers; they were
vindications or defences of Christianity. It is generally allowed that,
when St. Paul had been taken this second time by the Romans, he was
examined immediately, and required to account for his conduct; and that,
so odious was Christianity through the tyranny of Nero, he could procure
no person to plead for him. Nero, who had himself set fire to Rome,
charged it on the Christians, and they were in consequence persecuted in
the most cruel manner; he caused them to be wrapped up in pitched
clothes, and then, chaining them to a stake, he ordered them to be set
on fire to give light in the streets after night! Tormenti genus! To
this Juvenal appears to allude. Sat. i. v. 155.

Pone Tigellinum, taeda lucebis in illa

Qua stantes ardent, qui fixo gulture fumant.

"If into rogues omnipotent you rake,

Death is your doom, impaled upon a stake;

Smear'd o'er with wax, and set on blaze to light

The streets, and make a dreadful fire by night."

Dryden.

I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge - How much more
simple, elegant, and expressive are the apostle's own words: Μη αυτοις
λογισθειη· let it not be placed to their account! Let them not have to
reckon for it with the supreme Judge at the great day!

[2 Timothy 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ti2 4:17</span></span>

The Lord stood with me - When all human help failed, God, in a more
remarkable manner, interposed; and thus the excellency plainly appeared
to be of God, and not of man.

That by me the preaching might be fully known - When called on to make
his defense he took occasion to preach the Gospel, and to show that the
great God of heaven and earth had designed to illuminate the Gentile
world with the rays of his light and glory. This must have endeared him
to some, while others might consider him an opposer of their gods, and
be the more incensed against him.

I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion - I escaped the imminent
danger at that time. Probably he was seized in a tumultuous manner, and
expected to be torn to pieces. The words εκ στοματος or εκ βρυγμου
λεοντος ῥυεσθαι, to be rescued from the mouth or jaws of the lion, are a
proverbial form of speech for deliverance from the most imminent danger.
Several writers think Nero to be intended by the lion, because of his
rage and oppressive cruelty. But Helius Caesarinus was at this time
prefect of the city; Nero being in Greece. He was a bloody tyrant, and
Nero had given him the power of life and death in his absence. The
apostle may mean him, if the words be not proverbial.

[2 Timothy 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ti2 4:18</span></span>

And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work - None of the evil
designs formed against me to make me unfaithful or unsteady, to cause me
to save my life at the expense of faith and a good conscience, shall
succeed; my life may go, but he will preserve me unto his heavenly
kingdom. A continuance on earth the apostle expects not; but he has
glory full in view, and therefore he gives God glory for what he had
done, and for what he had promised to do.

[2 Timothy 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ti2 4:19</span></span>

Salute Prisca and Aquila - Several MSS., versions, and fathers have
Priscilla instead of Prisca: they are probably the same as those
mentioned [Act 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#018.md), [Act
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#026.md).

The household of Onesiphorus - See [Ti2
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#016.md). Onesiphorus was probably at this
time dead: his family still remained at Ephesus.

[2 Timothy 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ti2 4:20</span></span>

Erastus abode at Corinth - He was treasurer of that city, as we learn
from [Rom 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#023) (note.md). The apostle
had sent him and Timothy on a mission to Macedonia, [Act
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#022.md), whence it is probable he
returned to Corinth, and there became finally settled.

Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick - Even the apostles could not work
miracles when they pleased; that power was but rarely given, and that
for very special purposes. Trophimus was an Ephesian. See [Act
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004.md), and the note there.

Miletus was a maritime town of Ionia, not far from Ephesus; but there
was another Miletus, in Crete, which some learned men think to be
intended here. It appears that St. Paul went from Macedonia to Corinth,
where he left Erastus; from Corinth he proceeded to Troas, where he
lodged with Carpus: from Troas he went to Ephesus, where he visited
Timothy; from Ephesus he went to Miletus, where he left Trophimus sick;
and having embarked at Miletus, he went by sea to Rome. See Calmet. It
is most likely, therefore, that the Miletus of Ionia is the place
intended.

[2 Timothy 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ti2 4:21</span></span>

Come before winter -

1\. Because the apostle's time was short and uncertain.

2\. Because sailing in those seas was very dangerous in winter. Whether
Timothy saw the apostle before he was martyred is not known.

Eubulus - This person is nowhere else mentioned in the New Testament.

Pudens - Of this person we have traditions and legends, but nothing
certain. The Catholics make him bishop of Rome.

Linus - He also is made, by the same persons, bishop of Rome; but there
is no sufficient ground for these pretensions.

Claudia - Supposed to be the wife of Pudens. Some think she was a
British lady, converted by St. Paul; and that she was the first that
brought the Gospel to Britain.

All the brethren - All the Christians, of whom there were many at Rome;
though of Paul's companions in travel, only Luke remained there.

[2 Timothy 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ti2 4:22</span></span>

The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit - This is a prayer addressed to
Christ by one of the most eminent of his apostles; another proof of the
untruth of the assertion, that prayer is never offered to Christ in the
New Testament. He prays that Christ may be with his spirit,
enlightening, strengthening, and confirming it to the end.

Grace be with you - These words show that the epistle was addressed to
the whole Church, and that it is not to be considered of a private
nature.

Amen - Omitted by ACFG and some others. See the note on this word at the
end of the preceding epistle (note).

The principal subscriptions, both in the versions and MSS., are the
following: -

The Second Epistle to Timothy was written from Rome. - Syriac.

To the man Timothy. - Aethiopic,

Nothing in the Vulgate.

End of the epistle; it was written from the city of Rome when Timothy
had been constituted bishop over Ephesus; and when Paul had stood the
second time in the presence of Nero Caesar, the Roman emperor. Praise to
the Lord of glory, perpetual, perennial, and eternal! Amen, Amen, Amen.
- Arabic.

The Second Epistle to Timothy is ended, who was the first bishop of the
Church of Ephesus. It was written from Rome when Paul had stood the
second time before Nero, the Roman emperor. - Philoxenian Syriac.

Written from Rome, and sent by Onesimus. - Coptic.

The MSS. are also various: -

The Second Epistle to Timothy is finished; that to Titus begins.

The second to Timothy, written from Laodicea. - Codex Alexandrinus.

The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy, ordained the first
bishop of the Church of the Ephesians, was written from Rome when Paul
was brought the second time before Nero Caesar. - Common Greek Text.

There are other slighter differences in the MSS., but they are unworthy
of note.

That the epistle was written from Rome, about the year 65 or 66, and a
little before St. Paul's martyrdom, is the general opinion of learned
men. See the preface.

The reader has already been apprized that this is most probably the last
epistle the apostle ever wrote; and it is impossible to see him in a
more advantageous point of view than he now appears, standing on the
verge of eternity, full of God, and strongly anticipating an eternity of
glory. For farther observations, see the conclusion of the first
epistle, ([Ti1 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#021) (note).md)
