### [Acts Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001.md)

[Acts](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">act 20:0</span></span>

Paul retires to Macedonia, [Act 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001.md).
He goes into Greece, where he tarries three months and, purposing to
sail to Syria, he returns through Macedonia, [Act
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#002.md), [Act
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#003.md). Several persons accompany him
into Asia, and then go before and tarry for him at Troas, [Act
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004.md), [Act
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#005.md). Paul and Luke sail from
Philippi, and in five days reach Troas, where they meet their brethren
from Asia, and abide there seven days, [Act
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#006.md). On the first day of the week,
the disciples coming together to break bread, Paul preaching to them,
and continuing his speech till midnight, a young man of the name of
Eutychus, being in a deep sleep, fell from the third loft and was
killed, [Act 20:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#007.md). Paul restores him
to life, resumes his discourse, and continuing it till daybreak, then
departs, [Act 20:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#010.md). Luke and his
companions come to Assos, whither Paul comes by land, [Act
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#013.md). He embarks with them at Assos,
comes to Mitylene, [Act 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#014.md). Sails
thence, and passes by Chios, arrives at Samos, tarries at Trogyllium,
and comes to Miletus, [Act 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#015.md).
Purposing to get as soon as possible to Jerusalem, he sends from
Miletus, and calls the elders of the Church of Ephesus, to whom he
preaches a most directing sermon, gives them the most solemn
exhortations, kneels down and prays with them, takes a very affecting
leave of them, and sets sail for Caesarea, in order to go to Jerusalem,
vv. 16-38.

[Acts 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 20:1</span></span>

After the uproar was ceased - The tumult excited by Demetrius apparently
induced Paul to leave Ephesus sooner than he had intended. He had
written to the Corinthians that he should leave that place after
pentecost, [Co1 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#008.md); but it is very
probable that he left it sooner.

[Acts 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 20:2</span></span>

He came into Greece - Εις την Ἑλλαδα, Into Hellas, Greece properly so
called, the regions between Thessaly and Propontis, and the country of
Achaia. He did not, however, go there immediately: he passed through
Macedonia, [Act 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001.md), in which he
informs us, [Co2 7:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#005.md), that he
suffered much, both from believers and infidels; but was greatly
comforted by the arrival of Titus, who gave him a very flattering
account of the prosperous state of the Church at Corinth. A short time
after this, being still in Macedonia, he sent Titus back to Corinth,
[Co2 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#016.md), [Co2
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#017.md), and sent by him the second
epistle which he wrote to that Church, as Theodoret and others suppose.
Some time after, he visited Corinth himself, according to his promise,
[Co1 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#005.md). This was his third voyage
to that city, [Co2 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#014.md); [Co2
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#001.md). What he did there at this time
cannot be distinctly known; but, according to St. Augustin, he ordered
every thing relative to the holy eucharist, and the proper manner in
which it was to be received. See Calmet.

[Acts 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 20:3</span></span>

Abode three months - Partly, as we may suppose, at Corinth, at Athens,
and in Achaia; from which place he is supposed to have sent his epistle
to the Romans, because he continued longer here than at any other place,
and mentions several of the Corinthians in his salutations to the
believers of Rome.

When the Jesus laid wait for him - Paul had determined to go by sea to
Syria, and from thence to Jerusalem. This was the first object of his
journey; and this was the readiest road he could take; but, hearing that
the Jews had laid wait for him, probably to attack his ship on the
voyage, seize his person, sell him for a slave, and take the money which
he was carrying to the poor saints at Jerusalem, he resolved to go as
much of the journey as he conveniently could, by land. Therefore, he
returned through Macedonia, and from thence to Troas, where he embarked
to sail for Syria, on his way to Jerusalem. The whole of his journey is
detailed in this and the following chapter. See also the map.

[Acts 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 20:4</span></span>

And there accompanied him - Rather, says Bishop Pearce, there followed
him as far as to Asia; for they were not in his company till he set sail
from Philippi, and came to them at Troas, in Asia, whither they had gone
before, and where they tarried for him, [Act
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#005.md).

Into Asia - Αχρι της Ασιας; These words are wanting in two MSS., Erpen,
the Ethiopic, Coptic, and Vulgate. Some think that they embarrass this
place; for how these could accompany him into Asia, and go before him,
and tarry for him at Troas, [Act 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#006.md),
is not so very clear; unless we suppose, what I have glanced at in the
table of contents, that they came with him to Asia, but, he tarrying a
short time, they proceeded on their journey, and stopped for him at
Troas, where he shortly after rejoined them. Mr. Wakefield gets rid of
the difficulty by reading the verse thus: Now Sopater of Berea
accompanied him; but Aristarchus and Secundus of Thessalonica, Gaius of
Derbe, Timothy of Lystra, and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia, went
before, and tarried for us at Troas.

Sopater of Berea - Sopater seems to be the same as Sosipater, whom St.
Paul mentions as his kinsman, [Rom
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#021.md). ADE, more than twenty others,
with the Coptic, Armenian, later Syriac in the margin, Vulgate, Itala,
Theophylact, Origen, and Bede, add Πυρῥου, Sopater the Son of Pyrrhus.
Griesbach has received this into his text.

Aristarchus of Thessalonica - This person occurs in [Act
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#029.md), and is mentioned there as a
Macedonian. He attended Paul in his journey to Rome, [Act
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#002.md), and was his fellow laborer, [Plm
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#024.md), and his fellow prisoner, [Col
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010.md), [Col
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#011.md). Secundus is mentioned nowhere
but in this place.

Gaius of Derbe - This is supposed to be the same who is mentioned [Act
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#026.md), and who is there called a man
of Macedonia, of which some suppose he was a native, but descended from
a family that came from Derbe; but as Gaius, or Caius, was a very common
name, these might have been two distinct persons. One of this name was
baptized by St. Paul at Corinth, [Co1
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#014.md), and entertained him as his host
while he abode there, [Rom 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#023.md), and
was probably the same to whom St. John directs his third epistle.

And Timotheus - Of Lystra, is added by the Syriac. This was the same
person of whom mention is made, [Act
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#001.md), and to whom St. Paul wrote the
two epistles which are still extant; and who was a native of Lystra, as
we learn from the above place. It was on this evidence, probably that
the ancient Syriac translator added, of Lystra, to the text. This
reading is not supported by any MSS.

Tychicus - of Asia - This person was high in the confidence of St. Paul.
He styles him a beloved brother, and faithful minister in the Lord, whom
he sent to the Ephesians, that he might know their affairs, and comfort
their hearts, [Eph 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#021.md), [Eph
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#022.md). He sent him for the same
purpose, and with the same commendations, to the Colossians, [Col
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#007.md), [Col
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#008.md). Paul seems also to have designed
him to superintend the Church at Crete in the absence of Titus; see [Tit
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#012.md). He seems to have been the most
intimate and confidential friend that Paul had.

Trophimus - Was an Ephesian; and both he and Tychicus are called
Εφεσιοι, Ephesians, instead of Ασιανοι, Asiatics, in the Codex Bezae,
both Greek and Latin, and in the Sahidic. He accompanied Paul from
Ephesus into Greece, as we see here; and from thence to Jerusalem, [Act
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#029.md). He had, no doubt, traveled with
him on other journeys, for we find, by [Ti2
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#020.md), that he was obliged to leave him
sick at Miletus, being then, as it is likely, on his return to his own
kindred at Ephesus.

[Acts 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 20:5</span></span>

Tarried for us at Troas - See the preceding verse. Troas was a small
town in Phrygia Minor, in the province called the Troad: see [Act
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#008.md).

[Acts 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 20:6</span></span>

Days of unleavened bread - The seven days of the passover, in which they
ate unleavened bread. See the account of this festival in the notes on
Exodus 12:1-51 (note). It is evident, from the manner in which St. Luke
writes here, that he had not been with St. Paul since the time he
accompanied him to Philippi, [Act
16:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#010.md); but he now embarks at
Philippi with the apostle, and accompanies him to Troas, and continues
with him through the rest of his journey.

To Troas in five days - So long they were making this voyage from
Philippi, being obliged to keep always by the coast, and in sight of the
land; for the magnetic needle was not yet known. See the situation of
these places upon the map.

[Acts 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 20:7</span></span>

Upon the first day of the week - What was called κυριακη, the Lord's
day, the Christian Sabbath, in which they commemorated the resurrection
of our Lord; and which, among all Christians, afterwards took the place
of the Jewish Sabbath.

To break bread - To break eucaristia, the eucharist, as the Syriac has
it; intimating, by this, that they were accustomed to receive the holy
sacrament on each Lord's day. It is likely that, besides this, they
received a common meal together. Some think the αγαπη, or love feast, is
intended.

Continued his speech until midnight - At what time he began to preach we
cannot tell, but we hear when he concluded. He preached during the whole
night, for he did not leave off till the break of the next day, [Act
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#011.md), though about midnight his
discourse was interrupted by the fall of Eutychus. As this was about the
time of pentecost, and we may suppose about the beginning of May, as
Troas was in about 40 degrees of north latitude, the sun set there at
seven p.m. and rose at five a.m., so that the night was about eight
hours long; and taking all the interruptions together, and they could
not have amounted to more than two hours, and taking no account of the
preceding day's work, Paul must have preached a sermon not less than six
hours long. But it is likely that a good part of this time was employed
in hearing and answering questions; for διελεγετο, and διαλεγομενου, may
be thus understood.

[Acts 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 20:8</span></span>

Upper chamber - It was in an upper chamber in the temple that the
primitive disciples were accustomed to meet: on that account, they might
have preferred an upper chamber whenever they could meet with it. The
pious Quesnel supposes that the smoke, issuing from the many lamps in
this upper chamber, was the cause of Eutychus falling asleep; and this,
he says, the apostle mentions, in charity, to excuse the young man's
appearing negligent.

[Acts 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 20:9</span></span>

There sat in a window - This was probably an opening in the wall, to let
in light and air, for there was no glazing at that time; and it is
likely that Eutychus fell backward through it, down to the ground, on
the outside; there being nothing to prevent his falling out, when he had
once lost the power to take care of himself, by getting into a deep
sleep.

[Acts 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 20:10</span></span>

And Paul - fell on him - Επεπεσεν αυτῳ, Stretched himself upon him, in
the same manner as Elisha did on the Shunammite's son, [Kg2
4:33-35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#033.md); though the action of lying on
him, in order to communicate warmth to the flesh, might not have been
continued so long as in the above instance; nor indeed was it necessary,
as the natural warmth had not yet left the body of Eutychus; but the son
of the Shunammite had been some time dead.

[Acts 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 20:11</span></span>

Had broken bread - Had taken some refreshment, in order to their
journey.

And talked a long while - Ὁμιλησας, Having familiarly conversed, for
this is the import of the word, which is very different from the
διελεγετο, of the seventh verse, and the διαλεγομενου, of the ninth;
which imply solemn, grave discourse.

[Acts 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 20:13</span></span>

Sailed unto Assos - Assos, according to Pausanias, Eliac. ii. 4, and
Pliny, Hist. Nat. xxxvi. 27, was a maritime town of Asia, in the Troad.
Strabo and Stephanus place it in Mysia. It was also called Apollonia,
according to Pliny, Ib. lib. [Act
20:30](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#030.md). The passage by sea to this
place was much longer than by land; and therefore St. Paul chose to go
by land, while the others went by sea.

Intending to take in Paul - Αναλαμβανειν, To take him in Again; for it
appears he had already been aboard that same vessel: probably the same
that had carried them from Philippi to Troas, [Act
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#006.md).

[Acts 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 20:14</span></span>

Came to Mitylene - This was a seaport town in the isle of Lesbos: see
its place in the map.

[Acts 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 20:15</span></span>

Over against Chios - This was a very celebrated island between Lesbos
and Samos, famous in antiquity for its extraordinary wines. At this
island the apostle did not touch.

Arrived at Samos - This was another island of the Aegean Sea, or
Archipelago. It does not appear that they landed at Samos: they passed
close by it, and anchored at Trogyllium. This was a promontory of Ionia,
which gave name to some small islands in the vicinity of Samos: Της δε
Τρωγιλιου προκειται νησιον ὁμωνυμον: before Trogyllium is situated an
island of the same name. Strabo, lib. xiv. p. 635. Pliny also mentions
this place, Hist. Nat. lib. v. cap. 31. Near this place was the mouth of
the famous river Maeander.

Came to Miletus - A celebrated city in the province of Caria, about
twelve or fifteen leagues from Ephesus, according to Calmet. Miletus is
famous for being the birthplace of Thales, one of the seven wise men of
Greece, and founder of the Ionic sect of philosophers. Anaximander was
also born here, and several other eminent men. The Turks, who lately
possessed it, call it Melas.

[Acts 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 20:16</span></span>

To sail by Ephesus - Not to touch there at this time.

To be at Jerusalem the day of pentecost - That he might have the
opportunity of preaching the kingdom of God to multitudes of Jews from
different places, who would come up to Jerusalem at that feast; and then
he no doubt expected to see there a renewal of that day of pentecost in
which the Spirit was poured out on the disciples, and in consequence of
which so many were converted to God.

[Acts 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 20:17</span></span>

He sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the Church - These are
called επισκοποι, bishops, [Act 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028.md).
By the πρεσβυτεροι, presbyters or elders, here, we are to understand all
that were in authority in the Church, whether they were επισκοποι,
bishops or overseers, or seniors in years, knowledge, and experience.
The πρεσβυτεροι, or elders, were probably the first order in the Church;
an order which was not so properly constituted, but which rose out of
the state of things. From these presbuteroi the episcopoi, overseers or
superintendents, were selected. Those who were eldest in years,
Christian knowledge, and experience, would naturally be preferred to all
others, as overseers of the Church of Christ. From the Greek word
πρεσβυτερος, comes the Latin presbyterus, the English presbyter, the
French prestre, and our own term priest; and all, when traced up to
their original, signify merely an elderly or aged person; though it soon
became the name of an office, rather than of a state of years. Now, as
these elders are called επισκοποι, bishops, in [Act
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028.md), we may take it for granted that
they were the same order; or, rather, that these superintendents of the
Church were indifferently called either presbyters or bishops.

As he had not time to call at Ephesus, he thought it best to have a
general convocation of the heads of that Church, to meet him at Miletus,
that he might give them the instructions mentioned in the succeeding
parts of this chapter.

[Acts 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 20:18</span></span>

After what manner I have been with you - The Codex Bezae adds here, for
three years, and even more, which reading might have been borrowed from
[Act 20:31](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#031.md), though the time assigned
by it is too long.

[Acts 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 20:19</span></span>

Serving the Lord with all humility, etc. - This relates not only to his
zealous and faithful performance of his apostolic functions, but also to
his private walk as a Christian; and shows with what carefulness this
apostle himself was obliged to walk, in order to have his calling and
election, as a Christian, ratified and made firm.

[Acts 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 20:20</span></span>

I kept back nothing - Notwithstanding the dangers to which he was
exposed, and the temptations he must have had to suppress those truths
that were less acceptable to the unrenewed nature of man, or to the
particular prejudices of the Jews and the Gentiles, he fully and
faithfully, at all hazards, declared what he terms, [Act
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#027.md), the whole counsel of God.
"Behold here," says the judicious and pious Calmet, "the model of a good
shepherd - full of doctrine and zeal: he communicates with profusion,
and yet with discretion, without jealousy and without fear, what God had
put in his heart, and what charity inspires. A good shepherd, says St.
Bernard, should always have abundance of bread in his scrip, and his dog
under command. His dog is his zeal, which he must lead, order, and
moderate; his scrip full of bread is his mind full of useful knowledge;
and he should ever be in readiness to give nourishment to his flock." He
who will quarrel with this sentiment, because of the uncouthness of the
simile, needs pity, and deserves censure.

[Acts 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 20:21</span></span>

Testify both to - Jews and - Greeks - He always began with the Jews;
and, in this case, he had preached to them alone for three months, [Act
19:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#008.md), and only left their
synagogues when he found, through their obstinacy, he could do them no
good.

Repentance toward God, etc. - As all had sinned against God, so all
should humble themselves before him against whom they have sinned; but
humiliation is no atonement for sin; therefore repentance is
insufficient, unless faith in our Lord Jesus Christ accompany it.
Repentance disposes and prepares the soul for pardoning mercy; but can
never be considered as making compensation for past acts of
transgression. This repentance and faith were necessary to the salvation
both of Jews and Gentiles; for all had sinned, and come short of God's
glory. The Jews must repent, who had sinned so much, and so long,
against light and knowledge. The Gentiles must repent, whose scandalous
lives were a reproach to man. Faith in Jesus Christ was also
indispensably necessary; for a Jew might repent, be sorry for his sin,
and suppose that, by a proper discharge of his religious duty, and
bringing proper sacrifices, he could conciliate the favor of God: No,
this will not do; nothing but faith in Jesus Christ, as the end of the
law, and the great and only vicarious sacrifice, will do; hence he
testified to them the necessity of faith in this Messiah. The Gentiles
might repent of their profligate lives, turn to the true God, and
renounce all idolatry: this is well, but it is not sufficient: they also
have sinned, and their present amendment and faith can make no atonement
for what is past; therefore, they also must believe on the Lord Jesus,
who died for their sins, and rose again for their justification.

[Acts 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 20:22</span></span>

I go bound in the spirit - Δεδεμενος τῳ πνευματι - Either meaning the
strong influence of the Divine Spirit upon his mind, or the strong
propensity in his own will, wish, and desire, to visit Jerusalem; and in
this sense δεειν, to bind, is sometimes used. But it appears more
consistent with the mind of the apostle, and with that influence under
which we find that he constantly acted, to refer it to the influence of
the Holy Ghost; ὑπο του πνευματος, being under the power of that Spirit;
as if he had said: "I have now no choice - God has not left me either to
the advices of friends, or to my own prudence: the Spirit of God obliges
me to go to Jerusalem, and yet does not intimate to me what peculiar
trials shall befall me there: I have only the general intimation that,
in every city where I proclaim the Gospel, bonds and afflictions await
me." This sense of the word Kypke has largely defended in his note here.

[Acts 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 20:24</span></span>

None of these things move me - Ουδενος λογον ποιουμαι; I consider them
as nothing; I value them not a straw; they weigh not with me.

Neither count I my life dear - I am not my own; my life and being are
the Lord's; he requires me to employ them in his service; I act under
his direction, and am not anxious about the issue.

Finish my course with joy - Τον δρομον μου, My ministerial function. We
have already met with this word in application to the same subject, [Act
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#025.md), where see the note. And the
apostle here adds, by way of explanation, και την διακονιαν, even that
ministry which I have received of the Lord. The words μετα χαρας, with
joy, are omitted by ABD, some others; the Syriac, Erpen, Coptic,
Sahidic, Ethiopic, Vulgate, and some of the fathers. If we consider them
as genuine they may imply thus much: that the apostle wished to fulfill
his ministry in such a way as might meet with the Divine approbation;
for nothing could give him joy that did not please and glorify God.

To testify - Διαμαρτυρασθαι, Earnestly, solemnly, and strenuously to
assert, vindicate, and prove the Gospel of the grace of God, not only to
be in itself what it professes to be, but to be also the power of God
for salvation to every one that believes.

[Acts 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 20:25</span></span>

Ye all - shall see my face no more - This probably refers simply to the
persons who were now present; concerning whom he might have had a Divine
intimation, that they should not be found in life when he should come
that way again. Or it may refer only to Ephesus and Miletus. From the
dangers to which he was exposed, it was, humanly speaking, unlikely that
he should ever return; and this may be all that is implied: but that he
did revisit those parts, though probably not Miletus or Ephesus, appears
likely from [Phi 1:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#025.md); [Phi
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#024.md); [Plm
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#022.md); [Heb
13:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#019.md). But in all these places he
speaks with a measure of uncertainty: he had not an absolute evidence
that he should not return; but, in his own mind, it was a matter of
uncertainty. The Holy Spirit did not think proper to give him a direct
revelation on this point.

[Acts 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 20:26</span></span>

I am pure from the blood of all - If any man, Jew or Gentile, perish in
his sins, his blood shall be upon him; he, alone, shall be accessary to
his own perdition. I am blameless, because I have fully shown to both
the way to escape from every evil.

[Acts 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 20:27</span></span>

I have not shunned to declare - Ου υπεϚιλαμην, I have not suppressed or
concealed any thing, through fear or favor, that might be beneficial to
your souls. This is properly the meaning of the original word. See the
note on [Act 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#020.md).

All the counsel of God - All that God has determined and revealed
concerning the salvation of man - the whole doctrine of Christ
crucified, with repentance towards God, and faith in Jesus as the
Messiah and great atoning Priest. In [Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md), Jesus Christ is called the
wonderful counsellor, פלא יועץ Pele Poets, which the Septuagint
translate μεγαλης βουλης αγγελος· The messenger of the great counsel. To
this the apostle may have referred, as we well know that this version
was constantly under his eye. Declaring therefore to them the whole
counsel of God, πασην την βουλην του Θεου, the whole of that counsel or
design of God, was, in effect, declaring the whole that concerned the
Lord Jesus, who was the messenger of this counsel.

[Acts 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 20:28</span></span>

Made you overseers - Εθετο επισκοπους, Appointed you bishops; for so we
translate the original word in most places where it occurs: but
overseers, or inspectors, is much more proper, from επι, over, and
σκεπτομαι, I look. The persons who examine into the spiritual state of
the flock of God, and take care to lead them in and out, and to find
them pasture, are termed episcopoi, or superintendents. The office of a
bishop is from God; a true pastor only can fulfill this office: it is an
office of most awful responsibility; few there are who can fill it; and,
of those who occupy this high and awful place, perhaps we may say there
are fewer still who discharge the duties of it. There are, however,
through the good providence of God, Christian bishops, who, while they
are honored by the calling, do credit to the sacred function. And the
annals of our Church can boast of at least as many of this class of men,
who have served their God and their generation, as of any other order,
in the proportion which this order bears to others in the Church of
Christ. That bishop and presbyter, or elder, were at this time of the
same order, and that the word was indifferently used of both, see
noticed on [Act 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#017) (note.md).

Feed the Church of God - This verse has been the subject of much
controversy, particularly in reference to the term Θεου, of God, in this
place; and concerning it there is great dissension among the MSS. and
versions. Three readings exist in them, in reference to which critics
and commentators have been much divided; viz. εκκλησιαν του Θεου, the
Church of God; του Κυριου, of the Lord; Κυριου και Θεου, of the Lord and
God. From the collections of Wetstein and Griesbach, it appears that but
few MSS., and none of them very ancient, have the word Θεου, of God;
with these only the Vulgate, and the later Syriac in the text, agree.
Κυριου, of the Lord, is the reading of ACDE, several others, the
Sahidic, Coptic, later Syriac in the margin, Armenian, Ethiopia, and
some of the fathers. Κυριου και Θεου, of the Lord and of God, is the
reading of the great majority; though the most ancient are for Κυριου,
of the Lord: on this ground Griesbach has admitted this reading into the
text, and put Κυριου και Θεου in the margin, as being next in authority.

Mr. Wakefield, who was a professed and conscientious Unitarian, decides
for του Θεου, of God, as the true reading; but, instead of translating
του ιδιου αἱματος, with his own blood, he translates, by his own Son,
and brings some passages from the Greek and Roman writers to show that
αἱμα and sanguis are used to signify son, or near relative; and, were
this the only place where purchasing with his own blood occurred, we
might receive this saying; but, as the redemption of man is, throughout
the New Testament, attributed to the sacrificial death of Christ, it is
not likely that this very unusual meaning should apply here. At all
events, we have here a proof that the Church was purchased by the blood
of Christ; and, as to his Godhead, it is sufficiently established in
many other places. When we grant that the greater evidence appears to be
in favor of του Κυριου, feed the Church of the Lord, which he has
purchased with his own blood, we must maintain that, had not this Lord
been God, his blood could have been no purchase for the souls of a lost
world.

[Acts 20:29](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 20:29</span></span>

After my departing - Referring, most likely, to his death; for few of
these evils took place during his life.

Grievous wolves - Persons professing to be teachers; Judaizing
Christians, who, instead of feeding the flock, would feed themselves,
even to the oppression and ruin of the Church.

[Acts 20:30](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 20:30</span></span>

Also of your own selves, etc. - From out of your own assembly shall men
arise, speaking perverse things, teaching for truth what is erroneous in
itself, and perversive of the genuine doctrine of Christ crucified.

To draw away disciples - To make schisms or rents in the Church, in
order to get a party to themselves. See, here, the cause of divisions in
the Church:

1\. The superintendents lose the life of God, neglect the souls of the
people, become greedy of gain, and, by secular extortions, oppress the
people.

2\. The members of the Church, thus neglected, oppressed, and irritated,
get their minds alienated from their rapacious pastors.

3\. Men of sinister views take advantage of this state of distraction,
foment discord, preach up the necessity of division, and thus the people
become separated from the great body, and associate with those who
profess to care for their souls, and who disclaim all secular views.

In this state of distraction, it is a high proof of God's love to his
heritage, if one be found who, possessing the true apostolic doctrine
and spirit, rises up to call men back to the primitive truth, and
restore the primitive discipline. How soon the grievous wolves and
perverse teachers arose in the Churches of Asia Minor, the first
chapters of the Apocalypse inform us. The Nicolaitans had nearly ruined
the Church of Ephesus, [Rev 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#002.md), [Rev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006.md). The same sect, with other false
teachers, infested the Church of Pergamos, and preached there the
doctrine of Balaam, [Rev 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#014.md), [Rev
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#015.md). A false prophetess seduced the
Church of Thyatira, [Rev 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#020.md). All
these Churches were in Asia Minor, and probably bishops or ministers
from each were present at this convocation.

[Acts 20:31](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 20:31</span></span>

Therefore watch, and remember - The only way to abide in the truth is to
watch against evil, and for good; and to keep in mind the heavenly
doctrines originally received. Unwatchfulness and forgetfulness are two
grand inlets to apostasy.

By the space of three years - Τριετιαν. The Greek word here does not
necessarily mean three whole years: it may be months more or less. In
[Act 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#008.md), [Act
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#010.md), we have an account of his
spending two years and three months among them; probably this is all
that is intended. One MS., perceiving that the time of three years was
not completed, inserts διετιαν, the space of two years.

[Acts 20:32](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">act 20:32</span></span>

I commend you to God - Instead of τῳ Θεῳ, to God, several MSS. have τῳ
Κυριῳ, to the Lord; neither reading makes any difference in the sense.

And to the word of his grace - The doctrine of salvation by Christ
Jesus.

Which is able to build you up - The foundation is Jesus Christ; God is
the great master-builder; the doctrine of his grace, or mercy, points
out the order and manner, as well as the extent, etc., of this building.
Let us observe the order of these things: -

1\. The soul of man, which was formerly the habitation of God, is now in
a state of ruin.

2\. The ruins of this soul must be repaired, that it may again become a
habitation of God through the Spirit.

3\. Jesus Christ is the only foundation on which this house can be
rebuilded.

4\. The doctrine of God's grace is the model, or plan, according to
which the building can be raised.

5\. When re-edified, each is to be a lively temple of the Lord, made
inwardly pure and outwardly righteous, and thus prepared for a state of
bliss.

6\. Being made children of God, by faith in Christ Jesus, and sanctified
by his Spirit, they have a right to the heavenly inheritance; for only
the children of the family can possess the celestial estate.

Thus we find they must be saved by grace, and be made thereby children
of God; be sanctified by his Spirit; and, then, being prepared for, they
are removed, in due time, into the heavenly inheritance.

[Acts 20:33](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 20:33</span></span>

I have coveted no man's silver, etc. - And from this circumstance they
would be able to discover the grievous wolves, and the perverters; for
these had nothing but their own interests in view; whereas the genuine
disciples of Christ neither coveted nor had worldly possessions. St.
Paul's account of his own disinterestedness is very similar to that
given by Samuel of his, [Sa1 12:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#003.md).

[Acts 20:34](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">act 20:34</span></span>

These hands have ministered, etc. - It was neither "sin nor discredit"
for the apostle to work to maintain himself, when the circumstances of
the Church were such that it could not support him. Still many eminent
ministers of God are obliged to support themselves and their families,
at least in part, in the same way, while indefatigably testifying the
Gospel of the grace of God. Whatever it may be to the people, it is no
cause of reproach to the minister, to be obliged thus to employ himself.

[Acts 20:35](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 20:35</span></span>

I have showed you all things - The preposition κατα is to be understood
before παντα; and the clause should be read thus - I have showed you In
all things, etc.

It is more blessed to give than to receive - That is, the giver is more
happy than the receiver. Where, or on what occasion, our Lord spake
these words we know not, as they do not exist in any of the four
evangelists. But that our Lord did speak them, St. Paul's evidence is
quite sufficient to prove. The sentiment is worthy of Christ. A truly
generous mind, in affluence, rejoices in opportunities to do good, and
feels happy in having such opportunities. A man of an independent
spirit, when reduced to poverty, finds it a severe trial to be obliged
to live on the bounty of another, and feels pain in receiving what the
other feels a happiness in communicating. Let, therefore, the man who is
able to give feel himself the obliged person, and think how much pain
the feeling heart of his supplicant must endure, in being obliged to
forego his native independence, in soliciting and receiving the bounty
of another. I am not speaking of common beggars; these have got their
minds already depraved, and their native independence reduced, by sin
and idleness, to servility.

[Acts 20:36](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">act 20:36</span></span>

He kneeled down and prayed - Kneeling is the proper posture of a
supplicant, it argues at once both humility and submission; and he who
prays to God should endeavor to feel the utmost measures of both.

[Acts 20:37](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">act 20:37</span></span>

Fell on Paul's neck - Leaned their heads against his shoulders, and
kissed his neck. This was not an unusual custom in the east.

[Acts 20:38](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">act 20:38</span></span>

That they should see his face no more - This was a most solemn meeting,
and a most affecting parting. The man who had first pointed out to them
the Lord Jesus Christ, by whom they had been brought into so glorious a
state of salvation, is now going away, in all likelihood, to be seen no
more till the day in which the quick and dead shall stand before the
throne of judgment. Such a scene, and its correspondent feelings, are
more easily imagined than described.

1\. As the disciples are stated to have come together on the first day
of the week, we may learn from this that, ever since the apostolic
times, the Lord's day, now the Christian Sabbath, was set apart for
religious exercises; such as the preaching of God's holy word, and
celebrating the sacrament of the Lord's Supper. Besides its being the
day on which our blessed Lord rose from the dead, the practice of the
apostles and the primitive Church is an additional reason why we should
religiously celebrate this first day of the week. They who, professing
the Christian religion, still prefer the Jewish Sabbath, have little to
support them in the New Testament. How prone is man to affect to be wise
above what is written, while he is, in almost every respect, below the
teaching so plainly laid down in the Divine word.

2\. The charge of St. Paul to the pastors of the Church of Christ at
Ephesus and Miletus contains much that is interesting to every Christian
minister:

1\. If he be sent of God at all, he is sent to feed the flock.

2\. But, in order to feed them, he must have the bread of life.

3\. This bread he must distribute in its due season, that each may have
that portion that is suitable to time, place, and state.

4\. While he is feeding others, he should take care to have his own soul
fed: it is possible for a minister to be the instrument of feeding
others, and yet starve himself.

5\. If Jesus Christ intrust to his care the souls he has bought by his
own blood, what an awful account will he have to give in the day of
judgment, if any of them perish through his neglect! Though the sinner,
dying in his sins, has his own blood upon his head, yet, if the watchman
has not faithfully warned him, his blood will be required at the
watchman's hand. Let him who is concerned read Ezekiel, [Eze
33:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#003.md), and think of the account which
he is shortly to give unto God.

3\. Tenderness and sympathy are not inconsistent with the highest state
of grace. Paul warns his hearers day and night with tears. His hearers
now weep sore at the departure of their beloved pastor. They who can
give up a Christian minister with indifference, have either profited
little under that ministry, or they have backslidden from the grace of
God. The pastors should love as fathers, the converts as children; and
all feel themselves one family, under that great head, Christ Jesus.
