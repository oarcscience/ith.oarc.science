### [1 Chronicles Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 28:0</span></span>

David assembles the princes of Israel, and informs them that the temple
was to be built by Solomon; to whom God had given the most gracious
promises, [Ch1 28:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#001.md). He exhorts them
and him to be obedient to God, that they might continue to prosper, [Ch1
28:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#008.md). He gives Solomon a pattern of
the work, [Ch1 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#011.md), [Ch1
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#012.md); directs him concerning the
courses of the priests and Levites, [Ch1
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#013.md); gives also gold, by weight, for
the different utensils of the temple, as God had directed him, [Ch1
28:14-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#014.md); encourages Solomon to
undertake the work, [Ch1 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#020.md), [Ch1
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#021.md).

[1 Chronicles 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 28:1</span></span>

David assembled - This refers to the persons whose names and offices we
have seen in the preceding chapter.

[1 Chronicles 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 28:2</span></span>

David - stood up upon his feet - He was now very old, and chiefly
confined to his bed, (see [Kg1 1:47](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#047).md);
and while he was addressing his son Solomon, he continued on the bed;
but when all the principal nobles of his kingdom came before him he
received strength to arise and address them, standing on his feet.

[1 Chronicles 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 28:3</span></span>

Thou shalt not build a house - See [Sa2
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#006.md), [Sa2
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#013.md), and the observations at the end
of that chapter.

[1 Chronicles 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 28:4</span></span>

Over Israel for ever - The government should have no end, provided they
continued to walk according to the commandments of God; see [Ch1
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#007.md). The government, as referring to
Christ, is, and will be, without end.

[1 Chronicles 28:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 28:8</span></span>

In the audience of our God - "Before the Word of the Lord." - T.

[1 Chronicles 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 28:10</span></span>

The Lord hath chosen thee - "The Word of the Lord hath chosen thee." -
T.

[1 Chronicles 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch1 28:11</span></span>

David gave to Solomon - the pattern - He gave him an ichnograph of the
building, with elevations, sections, and specifications of every part;
and all this he received by inspiration from God himself, (see [Ch1
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#012.md), [Ch1
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#019).md), just as Moses had received the
plan of the tabernacle.

The treasuries thereof - גנזכיו ganzaccaiv. The word גנזך ganzach is not
Hebrew, but is supposed to be Persian, the same word being found in [Ezr
3:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#001.md) :19. In this tongue we have the
word ganj, a granary, a hidden treasure, and gunjoor, and gunjineh, a
treasure, treasury, or barn. Parkhurst supposes that it is compounded of
גנז ganaz, to treasure up, and זך zach, pure; a treasury for the most
precious things.

[1 Chronicles 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch1 28:12</span></span>

All that he had by the Spirit - "By the Spirit of prophecy that was with
him." - T.

[1 Chronicles 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch1 28:14</span></span>

Of gold by weight - The quantity of gold which was to be put in each
article.

[1 Chronicles 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch1 28:15</span></span>

For the candlesticks - There was but one chandelier in the tabernacle;
there were ten in the temple. See [Kg1
7:49](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#049.md).

[1 Chronicles 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 28:18</span></span>

The chariot of the cherubims - "And the figure of the chariot, like to
the figure of the propitiatory, where are the figures of the golden
cherubim, extending their wings and covering the ark of the covenant of
the Lord." - T.

[1 Chronicles 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch1 28:19</span></span>

Understand in writing - In some vision of ecstasy he had seen a
regularly sketched out plan, which had made so deep an impression on his
mind that he could readily describe it to his son.

"That the architecture of the temple," says Dr. Delaney, "was of Divine
origin, I, for my part, am fully satisfied from this passage, and am
confirmed in this opinion by finding from Vilalpandas that the Roman, at
least the Greek, architecture is derived from this, as from its
fountain; and in my humble opinion even an infidel may easily believe
these to be of Divine original, inasmuch as they are, at least the
latter is, found perfect in the earliest models; nor hath the utmost
reach of human wisdom, invention, and industry, been ever able to
improve it, or alter it but to disadvantage, through the course of so
many ages."

[1 Chronicles 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 28:20</span></span>

The Lord God - my God, will be with thee - "The Word of the Lord my God
will be thy assistant." - T.

[1 Chronicles 28:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch1 28:21</span></span>

Behold, the courses of the priests - The priests and the Levites, the
cunning artificers, and the princes of the people, will be at thy
command. Thus David, having assigned him his work, and described the
manner in which it was to be done, shows him who were to be his
assistants in it, and encourages him in the great undertaking.

Here we find piety, good sense, prudence, zeal for the public welfare
and God's glory, the strongest attachments to the worship of Jehovah,
and concern for the ordinances of religion, all united; and Solomon has
his danger, his duty, and his interest placed before him in the truest
and most impressive light by his pious and sensible father.
