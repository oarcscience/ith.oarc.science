Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Acts Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001.md)

St. Luke's prologue, containing a repetition of Christ's history from
his passion till his ascension, [Act
1:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001.md). Remarkable circumstances in the
ascension, [Act 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#010.md), [Act
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#011.md). The return of the disciples to
Jerusalem, and their employment there, [Act
1:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#012.md). Peter's discourse concerning
the death of Judas Iscariot, [Act
1:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#015.md), and the necessity of choosing
another apostle in his place, [Act
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#021.md), [Act
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#022.md). Barnabas and Matthias being set
apart by prayer, the apostles having given their votes, Matthias is
chosen to succeed Judas, [Act 1:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#023.md).

[Acts 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 1:1</span></span>

The former treatise - The Gospel according to Luke, which is here most
evidently intended.

O Theophilus - See the note on [Luk
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#003.md).

To do and teach - These two words comprise his miracles and sermons.
This introduction seems to intimate that, as he had already in his
Gospel given an account of the life and actions of our Lord, so in this
second treatise he was about to give an account of the lives and acts of
some of the chief apostles, such as Peter and Paul.

[Acts 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 1:2</span></span>

After that he, through the Holy Ghost, etc. - This clause has been
variously translated: the simple meaning seems to be this - that Christ
communicated the Holy Spirit to his disciples, after his resurrection,
as he had not done before. In [Luk
24:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#045.md), it is said that he opened their
understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures; and in [Joh
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#022.md), that he breathed on them, and
said, receive ye the Holy Ghost. Previously to this, we may suppose that
the disciples were only on particular occasions made partakers of the
Holy Spirit; but from this time it is probable that they had a measure
of this supernatural light and power constantly resident in them. By
this they were not only able to proclaim the truth, but to discern the
meaning of all the Old Testament Scriptures which referred to Christ;
and to appoint whatever rites or ordinances were necessary for the
establishment of his Church. There were many things which the apostles
said, did, and decreed, for which they had no verbal instructions from
our Lord, at least, none that are recorded in the Gospels; we may
therefore conclude that these were suggested to them by that Holy Spirit
which now became resident in them, and that it is to this that St. Luke
refers in this verse, After that he, through the Holy Ghost, had given
commandments unto the apostles.

[Acts 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 1:3</span></span>

To whom - he showed himself alive - by many infallible proofs - Πολλοις
τεκμηριοις; by many proofs of such a nature, and connected with such
circumstances, as to render them indubitable; for this is the import of
the Greek word τεκμηριον. The proofs were such as these:

1\. Appearing to several different persons at different times.

2\. His eating and drinking with them.

3\. His meeting them in Galilee according to his own appointment.

4\. His subjecting his body to be touched and handled by them.

5\. His instructing them in the nature and doctrines of his kingdom.

6\. His appearing to upwards of five hundred persons at once, [Co1
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#006.md). And,

7\. Continuing these public manifestations of himself for forty days.

The several appearances of Jesus Christ, during the forty days of his
sojourning with his disciples, between his resurrection and ascension,
are thus enumerated by Bishop Pearce:

The first was to Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, [Mat
28:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#001.md).

The second, to the two disciples on their way to Emmaus, [Luk
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#015.md).

The third, to Simon Peter, [Luk 24:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#034.md).

The fourth, to ten of the apostles, Thomas being absent, [Luk
24:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#036.md), and [Joh
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019.md). (All these four appearances
took place on the day of his resurrection.)

The fifth was to the eleven disciples, Thomas being then with them, [Joh
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#026.md).

The sixth, to seven of the apostles in Galilee, at the sea of Tiberias,
[Joh 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#004.md).

The seventh, to James, [Co1 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#007.md), most
probably in Jerusalem, and when Jesus gave an order for all his apostles
to assemble together, as in [Act 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#004.md).

The eighth, when they were assembled together, and when he led them unto
Bethany, [Luk 24:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#050.md), from whence he
ascended to heaven. But see the note on [Joh
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#014.md), for farther particulars.

Pertaining to the kingdom of God - Whatever concerned the doctrine,
discipline, and establishment of the Christian Church.

[Acts 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 1:4</span></span>

And, being assembled together - Instead of συναλιζομενος, being
assembled together, several good MSS. and versions read συναυλιζομενος,
living or eating together, which refers the conversation reported here
to some particular time, when he sat at meat, with his disciples. See
[Mar 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#014.md) : [Luk
24:41-44](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#041.md). But probably the common
reading is to be preferred; and the meeting on a mountain of Galilee is
what is here meant.

The promise of the Father - The Holy Spirit, which indeed was the grand
promise of the New Testament, as Jesus Christ was of the Old. And as
Christ was the grand promise of the Old Testament, during the whole
continuance of the old covenant; so is the Holy Ghost, during the whole
continuance of the new. As every pious soul that believed in the coming
Messiah, through the medium of the sacrifices offered up under the law,
was made a partaker of the merit of his death, so every pious soul that
believes in Christ crucified is made a partaker of the Holy Spirit.
Thus, as the benefit of the death of Christ extended from the foundation
of the world till his coming in the flesh, as well as after, so the
inspiration of the Holy Spirit has been, and will be continued through
the whole lapse of time, till his coming again to judge the world. It is
by this Spirit that sin is made known, and by it the blood of the
covenant is applied; and indeed, without this, the want of salvation
cannot be discovered, nor the value of the blood of the covenant duly
estimated. How properly do we still pray, and how necessary is the
prayer, "Cleanse the thoughts of our hearts by the inspiration of thy
Holy Spirit, that we may perfectly love thee, and worthily magnify thy
name, through Jesus Christ our Lord! Amen." Communion Service.

Ye have heard of me - In his particular conversations with his
disciples, such as those related [Joh
14:16-26](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#016) (note.md); [Joh
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#026) (note.md); [Joh
16:7-15](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#007) (note.md); to which passages, and
the notes on them the reader is requested to refer: but it is likely
that our Lord alludes more particularly to the conversation he had with
them on one of the mountains of Galilee.

[Acts 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 1:5</span></span>

Ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence - This must
refer to some conversation that is not distinctly related by the
evangelists; as these identical words do not occur in any of the
preceding histories. The Codex Bezae reads this passage thus: but ye
shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost, which ye shall receive not many
days hence. John baptized with water, which was a sign of penitence, in
reference to the remission of sin; but Christ baptizes with the Holy
Ghost, for the destruction of sin, the illumination of the mind, and the
consolation of the heart. John's baptism was in reference to the
spiritual kingdom; but Christ's baptism established and maintained that
kingdom. From this passage we may also learn that baptism does not
always mean being plunged or immersed in water; for as this promise most
evidently refers to the communication of the Holy Spirit on the
following pentecost, and then he sat upon each as a cloven tongue of
fire, this certainly has more affinity to sprinkling than to plunging.
However, the mode of administering the sign is of very little
consequence; and which is the best mode is exceedingly dubious: the
stress should be laid on receiving the thing signified - the Holy Ghost,
to illuminate, regenerate, refine, and purify the heart. With this,
sprinkling or immersion are equally efficient: without this, both are
worth nothing.

[Acts 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 1:6</span></span>

When they therefore were come together - It is very likely that this is
to be understood of their assembling on one of the mountains of Galilee,
and there meeting our Lord.

At this time restore again the kingdom - That the disciples, in common
with the Jews, expected the Messiah's kingdom to be at least in part
secular, I have often had occasion to note. In this opinion they
continued less or more till the day of pentecost; when the mighty
outpouring of the Holy Spirit taught them the spiritual nature of the
kingdom of Christ. The kingdom had now for a considerable time been
taken away from Israel; the Romans, not the Israelites, had the
government. The object of the disciples' question seems to have been
this: to gain information, from their all-knowing Master, whether the
time was now fully come, in which the Romans should be thrust out, and
Israel made, as formerly, an independent kingdom. But though the verb
αποκαθιστανειν signifies to reinstate, to renew, to restore to a former
state or master, of which numerous examples occur in the best Greek
writers, yet it has also another meaning, as Schoettgen has here
remarked, viz. of ending, abolishing, blotting out: so Hesychius says,
αποκαταστασις is the same as τελειωσις, finishing, making an end of a
thing. And Hippocrates, Aph. vi. 49, uses it to signify the termination
of a disease. On this interpretation the disciples may be supposed to
ask, having recollected our Lord's prediction of the destruction of
Jerusalem, and the whole Jewish commonwealth, Lord, Wilt thou at this
time destroy the Jewish commonwealth, which opposes thy truth, that thy
kingdom may be set up over all the land? This interpretation agrees well
with all the parts of our Lord's answer, and with all circumstances of
the disciples, of time, and of place; but, still, the first is most
probable.

[Acts 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 1:7</span></span>

The times or the seasons - Χρονους η καιρους. Times here may signify any
large portion of a period, era, or century - such as an Olympiad,
lustrum or year; and seasons, the particular part, season, or
opportunity in that period, etc., in which it might be proper to do any
particular work. God has not only fixed the great periods in which he
will bring about those great revolutions which his wisdom, justice, and
mercy have designed, but he leaves himself at full liberty to choose
those particular portions of such periods as may be best for the
accomplishment of those purposes. Thus God is no necessary agent - every
thing is put in his own power, εν τῃ ιδιᾳ εξουσιᾳ, under his control and
authority; nor will he form decrees of which he must become the
necessary executor. The infinite liberty of acting or not acting, as
wisdom, justice, and goodness shall see best, is essential to God, nor
can there be a point in the whole of his eternity in which he must be
the necessary agent of a fixed and unalterable fate. Infinite, eternal
liberty to act or not to act, to create or not create, to destroy or not
destroy, belongs to God alone, and we must take care how we imagine
decrees, formed even by his own prescience, in reference to futurity,
which his power is from the moment of their conception laid under the
necessity of performing. In every point of time and eternity, God must
be free to act or not to act, as may seem best to his godly wisdom.

[Acts 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 1:8</span></span>

But ye shall receive power - Ληψεσθε δυναμιν. Translating different
terms of the original by the same English word is a source of
misapprehension and error. We must not understand δυναμις which we
translate power in this verse, as we do εξουσια, translated by the same
word in the preceding verse. In the one, God's infinite authority over
all times and seasons, and his uncompellable liberty of acting or not
acting in any given case, are particularly pointed out: in the other,
the energy communicated by him to his disciples, through which they were
enabled to work miracles, is particularly intended; and δυναμις, in
general, signifies such power, and is sometimes put for that of which it
is the cause, viz. a miracle. See [Mat
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#022.md); [Mat
11:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#020.md); [Mat
13:54](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#054.md), [Mat
13:58](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#058.md); [Mar
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#005.md); [Luk
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#013.md); and [Act
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#022.md). The disciples were to be made
instruments in the establishment of the kingdom of Christ; but this must
be by the energy of the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; nevertheless,
this energy would be given in such times and seasons, and in such
measures, as should appear best to the infinite wisdom of God. Christ
does not immediately answer the question of the disciples, as it was a
point savouring too much of mere curiosity; but he gave them such
information as was calculated to bring both their faith and hope into
action. St. Chrysostom has well observed, "that it is the prerogative of
an instructer to teach his disciple, not what he wishes to learn, but
what his master sees best for him:" Διδασκαλου τουτο εστι μη ἁ βουλεται
ὁ μαθητης, αλλ' ἁ συμφερει μαθειν, διδασκειν.

Ye shall be witnesses - in all Judea, etc. - Though the word earth, ἡ
γη, is often used to denote Judea alone, yet here, it is probable, it is
to be taken in its largest extent. All the inhabitants of the globe
might at that period be considered divisible into three classes.

1\. The Jews, who adhered to the law of Moses, and the prophetic
writings, worshipping the true God only, and keeping up the temple
service, as prescribed in their law.

2\. The Samaritans, a mongrel people, who worshipped the God of Israel
in connection with other gods, [Kg2
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#005.md), etc., and who had no kind of
religious connection with the Jews. See on [Mat
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#005) (note.md). And,

3\. The Gentiles, the heathens through all other parts of the world, who
were addicted to idolatry alone, and had no knowledge of the true God.

By the terms in the text we may see the extent to which this commission
of instruction and salvation was designed to reach: to the Jews; to the
Samaritans, and the uttermost part of the earth, i.e. to the Gentile
nations, thus, to the whole human race the Gospel of the kingdom was to
be proclaimed. When the twelve disciples were sent out to preach, [Mat
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#005.md), their commission was very
limited - they were not to go in the way of the Gentiles, nor enter into
any city of the Samaritans, but preach the Gospel to the lost sheep of
the house of Israel: but here their commission is enlarged, for they are
to go into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature. See
[Mat 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018.md).

[Acts 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 1:9</span></span>

He was taken up - He was speaking face to face with them, and while they
beheld he was taken up; he began to ascend to heaven, and they continued
to look after him till a cloud received him out of their sight - till he
had ascended above the region of the clouds, by the density of which all
farther distinct vision was prevented. These circumstances are very
remarkable, and should be carefully noted. They render insupportable the
theory that states, "that our Lord did not ascend to heaven; that his
being taken up signifies his going into some mountain, the top of which
was covered with clouds, or thick vapours; and that the two men in white
garments were two priests, or Levites, who simply informed the disciples
of his revisiting them again at some future time." One would suppose
that an opinion of this kind could hardly ever obtain credit among
people professing Christianity; and yet it is espoused by some men of
considerable learning and ingenuity. But the mere letter of the text
will be ever sufficient for its total confutation. He that believes the
text cannot receive such a miserable comment. Foreign critics and
divines take a most sinful latitude on subjects of this kind.

[Acts 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 1:10</span></span>

Looked steadfastly - Keeping their eyes intensely fixed on their
ascending Lord; continuing to look even after he had ascended above the
region of the inferior clouds.

Two men stood by them - Doubtless, angels in human shape.

In white apparel - As emblematical of their purity, happiness, and
glory.

[Acts 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 1:11</span></span>

Gazing up into heaven - Not to the top of a mountain, to which an
unbridled fancy, influenced by infidelity, would intimate he had
ascended, and not to heaven.

This same Jesus - Clothed in human nature, shall so come in like manner
- with the same body, descending from heaven by his sovereign and
all-controlling power, as ye have seen him go into heaven. Thus shall he
come again to judge the quick and the dead. It was a very ancient
opinion among Christians, that when Christ should come again to judge
the world he would make his appearance on Mount Olivet. Some think that
his coming again to destroy the Jewish nation is what the angels refer
to. See a connected account of the different appearances of Christ at
the end of this chapter.

[Acts 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 1:12</span></span>

A Sabbath day's journey - See the difficulties in this verse explained
in the note on [Luk 24:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#050) (note.md). A
Sabbath day's journey was seven furlongs and a half. Olivet was but five
furlongs from Jerusalem; and Bethany was fifteen. The first region or
tract of Mount Olivet, which was called Bethany, was distant from the
city a Sabbath day's journey, or seven furlongs and a half; and the same
distance did that tract called Bethphage extend from the city. When,
therefore; our Lord came to the place where these two tracts touched
each other, he there ascended, which place was distant from Jerusalem a
Sabbath day's journey, as St. Luke here remarks. See the notes referred
to above.

[Acts 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 1:13</span></span>

They went up into an upper room - This was either a room in the temple,
or in the house of one of the disciples, where this holy company was
accustomed to meet. In [Luk 24:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#053.md), it
is said that, after their return from Mount Olivet, they were
continually in the temple, praising and blessing God: it is probable,
therefore, that the upper room mentioned in this verse is that apartment
of the temple mentioned above. But still it is not certain that this
place should be so understood; as we have the fullest proofs that the
upper rooms in private houses were used for the purpose of reading the
law, and conferring together on religious matters. See several proofs in
Lightfoot. Add to this, that the room here mentioned seems to have been
the place where all the apostles lodged, οὑ ησαν καταμενοντες, and
therefore most probably a private house.

[Acts 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 1:14</span></span>

These - continued - in prayer and supplication - Waiting for the promise
of the Father, according to the direction of our Lord, [Luk
24:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#049.md). The words και τῃ δεησει, and in
supplication, are omitted by ABC\*DE, both the Syriac, the Coptic,
Ethiopic, Armenian, Vulgate, Itala, and some of the primitive fathers.
On this evidence, Griesbach has left them out of the text; and others
contend for the propriety of this omission, because, say they, τῃ
προσευχῃ and τῃ δεησει, prayer and supplication, mean the same thing.
Whether the reading be genuine or spurious, this inference is not just.
Prayer may simply imply any address to God, in the way of petition or
request; supplication, the earnest, affectionate, and continued
application to God for the blessing requested from him by prayer. Prayer
asks, supplication expostulates, entreats, urges and re-urges the
petition.

With the women - Probably those who had been witnesses of his
resurrection, with the immediate relatives of the apostles. Peter we
know was married, [Mat 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#014.md), and so
might others of the disciples; and therefore the wives of the apostles,
as well as of other pious men, may be here intended.

[Acts 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 1:15</span></span>

In the midst of the disciples - Μαθητων; but instead of this, αδελφων,
brethren, is the reading of ABC, a few others, with the Coptic,
Ethiopic, Armenian, and Vulgate. This seems the best reading, because of
what immediately follows; for it was not among the disciples merely that
he stood, but among the whole company, which amounted to one hundred and
twenty. It is remarkable that this was the number which the Jews
required to form a council in any city; and it is likely that in
reference to this the disciples had gathered together, with themselves,
the number of one hundred and twenty, chosen out of the many who had
been already converted by the ministry of our Lord, the twelve
disciples, and the seventy-two whom he had sent forth to preach, [Luk
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001.md), etc., thus they formed a
complete council in presence of which the important business of electing
a person in the place of Judas was to be transacted.

[Acts 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 1:16</span></span>

The Holy Ghost by the mouth of David - Thus is a strong attestation to
the Divine inspiration of the book of Psalms. They were dictated by the
Holy Spirit, and spoken by the mouth of David.

[Acts 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 1:17</span></span>

Obtained part of this ministry - Ελαχε τον κληρον, He obtained the lot
of this ministry - not that he or any of the twelve apostles, was chosen
to this ministry by lot, but as lot signifies the portion a man has in
life, what comes to him in the course of the Divine providence, or as an
especial gift of God's goodness, it is used here, as in many other parts
of the sacred writings, to signify office or station. On this subject
the reader is referred to the notes on [Lev
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#008.md), [Lev
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#009) (note.md); [Jos
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#002) (note.md): see also [Act
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#026) (note.md).

[Acts 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 1:18</span></span>

Purchased a field with the reward of iniquity - Probably Judas did not
purchase the field himself, but the money for which he sold his Lord was
thus applied, see [Mat 27:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#006.md). It is
possible, however, that he might have designed to purchase a field or
piece of ground with this reward of his iniquity, and might have been in
treaty far it, though he did not close the bargain, as his bringing the
money to the treasury proves: the priests, knowing his intentions, might
have completed the purchase, and, as Judas was now dead, applied the
field thus bought for the burial of strangers, i.e. Jews from foreign
parts, or others who, visiting Jerusalem, had died there. Though this
case is possible, yet the passage will bear a very consistent
interpretation without the assistant of this conjecture; for, in
ordinary conversation, we often attribute to a man what is the
consequence of his own actions, though such consequence was never
designed nor wished for by himself: thus we say of a man embarking in a
hazardous enterprise, he is gone to seek his death; of one whose conduct
has been ruinous to his reputation, he has disgraced himself; of another
who has suffered much in consequence of his crimes, he has purchased
repentance at a high price, etc., etc. All these, though undesigned,
were consequences of certain acts, as the buying of the yield was the
consequence of Judas's treason.

And falling headlong, he burst asunder - It is very likely that the 18th
and 19th verses are not the words of Peter, but of the historian, St.
Luke, and should be read in a parenthesis, and then the 17th and 20th
verses will make a connected sense. On the case of Judas, and the manner
of his death, see the observations at the end of this chapter.

[Acts 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 1:19</span></span>

It was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem - The repentance of
Judas, his dying testimony in behalf of our Lord's innocence, and his
tragical death, were publicly known, as was also the transaction about
the purchase of the field, and hence arose the name by which at was
publicly known. These circumstances must have lessened the credit of the
chief priests, and have prepared the public mind to receive the Gospel
of the kingdom, when preached to them after the day of pentecost.

That field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama - This proper
tongue was not the Hebrew; that had long ceased to be the proper tongue
in Palestine: it was a sort of Chaldaio-Syriac which was commonly
spoken. The word in the Syriac version is chacal-demo, and literally
signifies the field of blood; because it was bought by the price of the
life or blood of the Lord Jesus.

[Acts 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#020.md)

For it is written in the book of Psalms - The places usually referred to
are [Psa 69:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#025.md) : Let their habitation
be desolate, and let none dwell in their tents. And [Psa
109:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#008.md) : Let his days be few, and let
another take his office, פקדתו pekudato, his overseership, his charge of
visitation or superintendence, translated by the Septuagint, την
επισκοπην, Vulgate, episcopatum; and We, following both, bishopric, but
not with sufficient propriety, for surely the office or charge of Judas
was widely different from what we call bishopric, the diocess, estate,
and emoluments of a bishop. Επισκοπος, episcopos, which was corrupted by
our Saxon ancestors into biscop, and by us into bishop, signifies
literally an overseer or superintendent, from επι, over, and σκεπτομαι,
I see, a person who had the inspection, overseeing, or superintendence
of others. The ancient επισκοποι were persons who had the care of
different congregations of the Church of Christ; who traveled, preached,
enforced the discipline of the Church, and took care to prevent false
doctrines, heresies, etc. Those who still deserve this title, and it is
an august and noble one, walk by the same rule, and mind the same thing.
Επισκοπος, episcopus, or bishop, is a scriptural and sacred title; was
gloriously supported in the primitive Church; and many to the present
day are not less ornaments to the title, than the title is ornamental to
them. The best defenses of the truth of God, and the Protestant faith,
are in the works of the bishops of the British Churches.

The words quoted from the Psalms were originally spoken against the
enemies of David; and as David, in certain particulars, was a type of
Christ, the words are applied to him in an especial manner who had
sinned against his own soul and the life of his Master.

Which have companied with us - They judged it necessary to fill up this
blank in the apostolate by a person who had been an eye witness of the
acts of our Lord.

Went in and out - A phrase which includes all the actions of life.

[Acts 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 1:22</span></span>

Beginning from the baptism of John - From the time that Christ was
baptized by John in Jordan; for it was at that time that his public
ministry properly began.

Must one be ordained - This translation misleads every reader who cannot
examine the original text. There is no term for ordained in the Greek:
γενεσθαι, to be, is the only word in the verse to which this
interpretation can be applied. The New Testament printed at London, by
Robert Barker, the king's printer, in 1615, renders this and the
preceding verse more faithfully and more clearly than our common
version: Wherefore of these men who have companied with us, all the time
that the Lord Jesus was conversant among us, beginning from the baptism
of John, unto the day he was taken up from us, must one of them Be Made
a witness with us of his resurrection. The word ordained would naturally
lead most readers to suppose that some ecclesiastical rite was used on
the occasion, such as imposition of hands, etc., although nothing of the
kind appears to have been employed.

[Acts 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 1:23</span></span>

They appointed two - These two were probably of the number of the
seventy disciples; and, in this respect, well fitted to fill up the
place. It is likely that the disciples themselves were divided in
opinion which of these two was the most proper person, and therefore
laid the matter before God, that he might decide it by the lot. No more
than two candidates were presented; probably because the attention of
the brethren had been drawn to those two alone, as having been most
intimately acquainted with our Lord, or in being better qualified for
the work than any of the rest; but they knew not which to prefer.

Joseph called Barsabas - Some MSS. read Joses Barnabas, making him the
same with Joses Barnabas, [Act 4:36](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#036.md).
But the person here is distinguished from the person there, by being
called Justus.

[Acts 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 1:24</span></span>

Thou Lord, which knowest the hearts - Συ, κυριε, καρδιογνωστα. The word
καρδιογνωστης, the searcher of hearts, seems to be used here as an
attribute of God; he knows the hearts, the most secret purposes,
intentions, and dispositions of all men; and because he is the knower of
hearts, he knew which of these men he had qualified the best, by natural
and gracious dispositions and powers, for the important work to which
one of them was now to be appointed.

[Acts 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 1:25</span></span>

That he may take part of this ministry, etc. - Instead of τον κληρον,
the lot, which we translate part, τον τοπον, the place, is the reading
of ABC\*, Coptic, Vulgate, and the Itala in the Codex Bezae, and from
them the verse may be read thus, That he may take the place of this
ministry and apostleship, (from which Judas fell) and go to his own
place; but instead of ιδιον, own, the Codex Alexandrinus, and one of
Matthai's MSS., read δικαιον, just - that he might go to his just or
proper place.

This verse has been variously expounded:

1\. Some suppose that the words, that he might go to his own place, are
spoken of Judas, and his punishment in hell, which they say must be the
own place of such a person as Judas.

2\. Others refer them to the purchase of the field, made by the thirty
pieces of silver for which he had sold our Lord. So he abandoned the
ministry and apostolate, that he might go to his own place, viz. that
which he had purchased.

3\. Others, with more seeming propriety, state that his own place means
his own house, or former occupation; he left this ministry and
apostleship that he might resume his former employment in conjunction
with his family, etc. This is primarily the meaning of it in [Num
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#025.md) : And Balaam returned to His Own
Place, i.e. to his own country, friends, and employment.

4\. Others think it simply means the state of the dead in general,
independently of either rewards or punishments; as is probably meant by
[Ecc 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#020.md) : All go unto One Place: all
are of the dust, and all turn to dust again. But,

5\. Some of the best critics assert that the words (as before hinted)
belong to Matthias - his own place being the office to which he was
about to be elected. Should any object, this could not be called his own
place, because he was not yet appointed to it, but hell might be
properly called Judas's own place, because, by treason and covetousness,
he was fully prepared for that place of torment, it may be answered,
that the own or proper place of a man is that for which he is eligible
from being qualified for it, though he may not yet possess such a place:
so St. Paul, Every man shall receive His Own reward, τον ιδιον μισθον,
called there his own, not from his having it already in possession, for
that was not to take place until the resurrection of the just; but from
his being qualified in this life for the state of glory in the other.
See the observations at the end of the chapter.

[Acts 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 1:26</span></span>

They gave forth their lots - In what manner this or any other question
was decided by lot, we cannot precisely say. The most simple form was to
put two stones, pieces of board, metal, or slips of parchment, with the
names of the persons inscribed on them, into an urn; and after prayer,
sacrifice, etc., to put in the hand and draw out one of the lots, and
then the case was decided. I have considered this subject at large on
[Lev 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#008.md), [Lev
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#009.md); and [Jos
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#002.md).

He was numbered with the eleven apostles - The word συγκατεψηφισθη,
comes from συν, together with, κατα, according to, and ψηφος, a pebble
or small stone, used for lots, and as a means of enumeration among the
Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians; hence the words calculate, calculation,
etc., from calculus, a small stone or pebble. From this use of the word,
though it signifies in general to sum up, associate, etc., we may
conjecture that the calculus or pebble was used on this occasion. The
brethren agreed that the matter should be determined by lot; the lots
were cast into the urn; God was entreated to direct the choice; one drew
out a lot; the person whose name was inscribed on it was thereby
declared to be the object of God's choice, and accordingly associated
with the disciples. But it is possible that the whole was decided by
what we commonly call ballot, God inclining the hearts of the majority
to ballot for Matthias. Nothing certain can, however, be stated on this
head. Thus the number twelve was made up, that these might be the
fountains under God of the whole Christian Church, as the twelve sons of
Jacob had been of the Jewish Church. For it has already been remarked
that our Lord formed his Church on the model of the Jewish. See the
notes on [Joh 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#001.md), etc. As the Holy
Ghost, on the day of pentecost, was to descend upon them and endue them
with power from on high, it was necessary that the number twelve should
be filled up previously, that the newly elected person might also be
made partaker of the heavenly gift. How long it was found necessary to
keep up the number twelve, we are not informed: the original number was
soon broken by persecution and death.

On the death of Judas there is a great diversity of opinion among
learned men and divines.

1\. It is supposed, following the bare letter of the text, that Judas
hanged himself, and that, the rope breaking, he fell down, was burst
with the fall, and thus his bowels gushed out.

2\. That, having hanged himself, he was thrown on the dunghill, and, the
carcass becoming putrid, the abdomen, which soonest yields to
putrefaction burst, and the bowels were thus shed from the body, and
possibly torn out by dogs.

3\. That, being filled with horror and despair, he went to the top of
the house, or to some eminences and threw himself down; and thus,
failing headlong, his body was broken by the fall, and his bowels gushed
out.

4\. That Satan, having entered into him, caught him up in the air, and
thence precipitated him to the earth; and thus, his body being broken to
pieces, his bowels gushed out. This is Dr. Lightfoot's opinion, and has
been noticed on [Mat 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#005.md).

5\. Others think that he died or was suffocated through excessive grief;
and that thus the terms in the text, and in [Mat
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#005.md), are to be understood. The late
Mr. Wakefield defends this meaning with great learning and ingenuity.

6\. Others suppose the expressions to be figurative: Judas having been
highly exalted, in being an apostle, and even the purse-bearer to his
Lord and brother disciples, by his treason forfeited this honor, and is
represented as falling from a state of the highest dignity into the
lowest infamy, and then dying through excessive grief. The Rev. John
Jones, in his Illustrations of the four Gospels, sums up this opinion
thus: "So sensible became the traitor of the distinguished rank which he
forfeited, and of the deep disgrace into which he precipitated himself,
by betraying his Master, that he was seized with such violent grief as
occasioned the rupture of his bowels, and ended in suffocation and
death." P. 571.

After the most mature consideration of this subject, on which I
hesitated to form an opinion in the note on [Mat
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#005.md), I think the following
observations may lead to a proper knowledge of the most probable state
of the case.

1\. Judas, like many others, thought that the kingdom of the Messiah
would be a secular kingdom; and that his own secular interests must be
promoted by his attachment to Christ. Of this mind all the disciples
seem to have been, previously to the resurrection of Christ.

2\. From long observation of his Master's conduct, he was now convinced
that he intended to erect no such kingdom; and that consequently the
expectations which he had built on the contrary supposition must be
ultimately disappointed.

3\. Being poor and covetous, and finding there was no likelihood of his
profiting by being a disciple of Christ, he formed the resolution
(probably at the instigation of the chief priests) of betraying him for
a sum of money sufficient to purchase a small inheritance, on which he
had already cast his eye.

4\. Well knowing the uncontrollable power of his Master, he might take
it for granted that, though betrayed, he would extricate himself from
their hands; and that they would not be capable of putting him either to
pain or death.

5\. That having betrayed him, and finding that he did not exert his
power to deliver himself out of the hands of the Jews, and seeing, from
their implacable malice, that the murder of his most innocent Master was
likely to be the consequence, he was struck with deep compunction at his
own conduct, went to the chief priests, confessed his own profligacy,
proclaimed the innocence of his Master, and returned the money for which
he had betrayed him; probably hoping that they might be thus influenced
to proceed no farther in this unprincipled business, and immediately
dismiss Christ.

6\. Finding that this made no impression upon them, from their own
words, What is that to us? See thou to that, and that they were
determined to put Jesus to death, seized with horror at his crime and
its consequences, the remorse and agitation of his mind produced a
violent dysentery, attended with powerful inflammation; (which, in a
great variety of cases, has been brought on by strong mental agitation);
and while the distressful irritation of his bowels obliged him to
withdraw for relief, he was overwhelmed with grief and affliction, and,
having fallen from the seat, his bowels were found to have gushed out,
through the strong spasmodic affections with which the disease was
accompanied. I have known cases of this kind, where the bowels appeared
to come literally away by piece meal.

Now; when we consider that the word απηγξατο, [Mat
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#005.md), which we translate hanged
himself, is by the very best critics thus rendered, was choked, and that
the words of the sacred historian in this place, falling headlong, he
burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out, may be no
other than a delicate mode of expressing the circumstance to which I
have alluded under observation 6, perhaps this way of reconciling and
explaining the evangelist and historian will appear, not only probable,
but the most likely. To strengthen this interpretation, a few facts may
be adduced of deaths brought about in the same way with that in which I
suppose Judas to have perished. The death of Jehoram is thus related,
[Ch2 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#018.md), [Ch2
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#019.md) : And after all this, the Lord
smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease: and it came to pass
that, after the end of two years, His Bowels Fell Out, by reason of his
sickness; so he died of sore diseases; בתחלאים bethachaluim, with
inflammations, or ulcers. The death of Herod was probably of the same
kind, [Act 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#023.md). That of Aristobulus,
as described by Josephus, War, book i. chap. 3, is of a similar nature.
Having murdered his mother and brother, his mind was greatly terrified,
and his bowels being torn with excruciating torments, he voided much
blood, and died in miserable agonies. Again, in his Antiq. book xv.
chap. 10., sect. 3, he thus describes the death of Zenodorus: "His
bowels bursting, and his strength exhausted by the loss of much blood,
he died at Antioch in Syria."

Taking it for granted that the death of Judas was probably such as
related above, collating all the facts and evidences together, can any
hope be formed that he died within the reach of mercy? Let us review the
whole of these transactions.

I. It must be allowed that his crime was one of the most inexcusable
ever committed by man: nevertheless, it has some alleviations.

1\. It is possible that he did not think his Master could be hurt by the
Jews.

2\. When he found that he did not use his power to extricate himself
from their hands, he deeply relented that he had betrayed him.

3\. He gave every evidence of the sincerity of his repentance, by going
openly to the Jewish rulers:

(1.) Confessing his own guilt;

(2.) asserting the innocence of Christ;

(3.) returning the money which he had received from them; and there

(4.) the genuineness of his regret was proved by its being the cause of
his death. But,

II\. Judas might have acted a much worse part than he did:

1\. By persisting in his wickedness.

2\. By slandering the character of our Lord both to the Jewish rulers
and to the Romans; and, had he done so, his testimony would have been
credited, and our Lord would then have been put to death as a
malefactor, on the testimony of one of his own disciples; and thus the
character of Christ and his Gospel must have suffered extremely in the
sight of the world, and these very circumstances would have been pleaded
against the authenticity of the Christian religion by every infidel in
all succeeding ages. And,

3\. Had he persisted in his evil way, he might have lighted such a flame
of persecution against the infant cause of Christianity as must, without
the intervention of God, have ended in its total destruction: now, he
neither did, nor endeavored to do, any of these things. In other cases
these would be powerful pleadings.

Judas was indisputably a bad man; but he might have been worse: we may
plainly see that there were depths of wickedness to which he might have
proceeded, and which were prevented by his repentance. Thus things
appear to stand previously to his end. But is there any room for hope in
his death? In answer to this it must be understood,

1\. That there is presumptive evidence that he did not destroy himself;
and,

2\. That his repentance was sincere.

If so, was it not possible for the mercy of God to extend even to his
case? It did so to the murderers of the Son of God; and they were
certainly worse men (strange as this assertion may appear) than Judas.
Even he gave them the fullest proof of Christ's innocence: their buying
the field with the money Judas threw down was the full proof of it; and
yet, with every convincing evidence before them, they crucified our
Lord. They excited Judas to betray his Master, and crucified him when
they had got him into their power; and therefore St. Stephen calls them
both the betrayers and murderers of that Just One, [Act
7:52](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#052.md) : in these respects they were
more deeply criminal than Judas himself; yet even to those very
betrayers and murderers Peter preaches repentance, with the promise of
remission of sins, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, [Act
3:12-26](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#012.md).

If, then, these were within the reach of mercy, and we are informed that
a great company of the priests became obedient to the faith, [Act
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#007.md), then certainly Judas was not in
such a state as precluded the possibility of his salvation. Surely the
blood of the covenant could wash out even his stain, as it did that more
deeply engrained one of the other betrayers and murderers of the Lord
Jesus.

Should the 25th verse be urged against this possibility, because it is
there said that Judas fell from his ministry and apostleship, that he
might go to his own place, and that this place is hell; I answer,

1\. It remains to be proved that this place means hell; and,

2\. It is not clear that the words are spoken of Judas at all, but of
Matthias: his own place meaning that vacancy in the apostolate to which
he was then elected. See the note on [Act
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#025.md).

To say that the repentance of Judas was merely the effect of his horror;
that it did not spring from compunction of heart; that it was legal, and
not evangelical, etc., etc., is saying what none can with propriety say,
but God himself, who searches the heart. What renders his case most
desperate are the words of our Lord, [Mat
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#024.md) : Wo unto that man by whom the
Son of man is betrayed! It had been good for that man if he had not been
born! I have considered this saying in a general point of view in my
note on [Mat 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#024.md); and, were it not a
proverbial form of speech among the Jews, to express the state of any
flagrant transgressor, I should be led to apply it in all its literal
import to the case of Judas, as I have done, in the above note, to the
case of any damned soul; but when I find that it was a proverbial
saying, and that it has been used in many cases where the fixing of the
irreversible doom of a sinner is not implied, it may be capable of a
more favorable interpretation than what is generally given to it. I
shall produce a few of those examples from Schoettgen, to which I have
referred in my note on [Mat 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#024.md).

In Chagigah, fol. ii. 2, it is said: "Whoever considers these four
things, it would have been better for him had he never come into the
world, viz. That which is above - that which is below - that which is
before - and that which is behind; and whosoever does not attend to the
honor of his Creator, it were better for him had he never been born."

In Shemoth Rabba, sect. 40, fol. 135, 1, 2, it is said: "Whosoever knows
the law, and does not do it, it had been better for him had he never
come into the world."

In Viyikra Rabba, sect. 36, fol. 179, 4, and Midrash Coheleth, fol. 91,
4, it is thus expressed: "It were better for him had he never been
created; and it would have been better for him had he been strangled in
the womb, and never have seen the light of this world."

In Sohar Genes. fol. 71, col. 282, it is said: "If any man be
parsimonious towards the poor, it had been better for him had he never
came into the world." Ibid. fol. 84, col. 333: "If any performs the law,
not for the sake of the law, it were good for that man had he never been
created." These examples sufficiently prove that this was a common
proverb, and is used with a great variety and latitude of meaning, and
seems intended to show that the case of such and such persons was not
only very deplorable, but extremely dangerous; but does not imply the
positive impossibility either of their repentance or salvation.

The utmost that can be said for the case of Judas is this he committed a
heinous act of sin and ingratitude; but he repented, and did what he
could to undo his wicked act: he had committed the sin unto death, i.e.
a sin that involves the death of the body; but who can say (if mercy was
offered to Christ's murderers, and the Gospel was first to be preached
at Jerusalem that these very murderers might have the first offer of
salvation through him whom they had pierced) that the same mercy could
not be extended to the wretched Judas? I contend that the chief priests,
etc., who instigated Judas to deliver up his Master, and who crucified
him - and who crucified him too as a malefactor - having at the same
time the most indubitable evidence of his innocence, were worse men than
Judas Iscariot himself; and that, if mercy was extended to those, the
wretched penitent traitor did not die out of the reach of the yearning
of its bowels. And I contend, farther, that there is no positive
evidence of the final damnation of Judas in the sacred text.

I hope it will not displease the humane reader that I have entered so
deeply into the consideration of this most deplorable case. I would not
set up knowingly any plea against the claims of justice; and God forbid
that a sinner should be found capable of pleading against the cries of
mercy in behalf of a fellow culprit! Daily, innumerable cases occur of
persons who are betraying the cause of God, and selling, in effect,
Christ and their souls for money. Every covetous man, who is living for
this world alone, is of this stamp. And yet, while they live, we do not
despair of their salvation, though they are continually repeating the
sin of Judas, with all its guilt and punishment before their eyes!
Reader! learn from thy Lord this lesson, Blessed are the merciful, for
they shall obtain mercy. The case is before the Judge, and the Judge of
all the earth will do right.
