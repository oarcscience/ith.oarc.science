### [1 Chronicles Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 16:0</span></span>

David brings the ark into its tent; and offers sacrifices,
peace-offerings, and burnt-offerings, [Ch1
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#001), [Ch1
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#002); and gives portions to the people
of Israel, [Ch1 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#003). He appoints
proper ministers and officers for the ark, [Ch1
16:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#004). He delivers a solemn
thanksgiving on the occasion, vv. 7-36. How the different officers
served at the ark, [Ch1 16:37-42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#037). The
people return home, [Ch1 16:43](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#043).

[1 Chronicles 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 16:2</span></span>

He blessed the people - "He blessed the people in the name of the Word
of the Lord." - T.

[1 Chronicles 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 16:3</span></span>

To every one a loaf of bread - A whole cake. A good piece of flesh; "the
sixth part of an ox, and the sixth part of a hin of wine." - T. See [Sa2
6:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#018); see Jarchi also.

[1 Chronicles 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 16:5</span></span>

Asaph - See the preceding chapter, [Ch1
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#017) (note), etc.

[1 Chronicles 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 16:7</span></span>

David delivered first this psalm - I believe the meaning of this place
to be this: David made the psalm on the occasion above specified; and
delivered it to Asaph, who was the musician, and to his brethren, to be
sung by them in honor of what God had done in behalf of his people.

[1 Chronicles 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 16:10</span></span>

That seek the Lord - "That seek the Word of the Lord." - T.

[1 Chronicles 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch1 16:12</span></span>

Remember his marvellous works - The whole of the psalm refers to God's
wondrous actions among the nations in behalf of Israel.

[1 Chronicles 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 16:22</span></span>

Touch not mine anointed - By this title the patriarchs are generally
understood: they had a regal and sacerdotal power in the order of God.
In the behalf of the patriarchs God had often especially interfered: in
behalf of Abraham, [Gen 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#017); [Gen
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#003); and of Jacob, [Gen
31:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#024); [Gen
34:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#026); [Gen
35:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#005). But the title may be applied to
all the Jewish people, who were the anointed, as they were the elect and
peculiar people of God. See on [Heb
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#026) (note).

[1 Chronicles 16:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">ch1 16:31</span></span>

Let the heavens be glad - "Let the supreme angels be glad, and the
inhabitants of the earth rejoice." - T. In this place the Targumist uses
the Greek word αγγελοι, angels, in Hebrew letters thus, אנגלי angeley.

[1 Chronicles 16:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">ch1 16:35</span></span>

Save us, O God of our salvation - As he is the saving God, so we may
pray to him to save us. To pray to God under the attribute the influence
of which we need, serves to inspire much confidence. I am weak; Almighty
God, help me! I am ignorant; O thou Father of lights, teach me! I am
lost; O merciful God, save me; etc. See the notes on [Psa
96:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001) (note) and Psalm 105 (note).

[1 Chronicles 16:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">ch1 16:39</span></span>

Zadok the priest - Both Zadok and Abiathar were high priests at this
time: the former David established at Gibeah, or Gibeon, where the ark
had been all the days of Saul; and the latter he established at
Jerusalem, where the ark now was: so there were two high priests, and
two distinct services; but there was only one ark. How long the service
at Gibeon was continued we cannot tell; the principal functions were no
doubt performed at Jerusalem.

[1 Chronicles 16:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">ch1 16:42</span></span>

Musical instruments of God - Ad canendum Deo, "to sing to God." -
Vulgate. Των ωδων του Θεου, "of the sons of God." - Septuagint. The
Syriac is remarkable: "These were upright men who did not sing unto God
with instruments of music, nor with drums, nor with listra, nor with
straight nor crooked pipes, nor with cymbals; but they sang before the
Lord Almighty with a joyous mouth, and with a pure and holy prayer, and
with innocence and integrity." The Arabic is nearly the same. None of
the versions understand the words כלי שיר האלהים keley shir haelohim as
implying instruments of music of God, but instruments employed in the
song of God, or to praise God; as also the Targum. Query, Did God ever
ordain instruments of music to be used in his worship? Can they be used
in Christian assemblies according to the spirit of Christianity? Has
Jesus Christ, or his apostles, ever commanded or sanctioned the use of
them? Were they ever used any where in the apostolic Church? Does the
use of them at present, in Christian congregations, ever increase the
spirit of devotion? Does it ever appear that bands of musicians, either
in their collective or individual capacity, are more spiritual, or as
spiritual, as the other parts of the Church of Christ? Is there less
pride, self-will, stubbornness, insubordination, lightness, and
frivolity, among such persons, than among the other professors of
Christianity found in the same religious society? Is it ever remarked or
known that musicians in the house of God have attained to any depth of
piety, or superior soundness of understanding, in the things of God? Is
it ever found that those Churches and Christian societies which have and
use instruments of music in Divine worship are more holy, or as holy, as
those societies which do not use them? And is it always found that the
ministers which affect and recommend them to be used in the worship of
Almighty God, are the most spiritual men, and the most spiritual and
useful preachers? Can mere sounds, no matter how melodious, where no
word nor sentiment is or can be uttered, be considered as giving praise
to God? Is it possible that pipes or strings of any kind can give God
praise? Can God be pleased with sounds which are emitted by no sentient
being, and have in themselves no meaning? If these questions cannot be
answered in the affirmative: then, query, Is not the introduction of
such instruments into the worship of God antichristian, and calculated
to debase and ultimately ruin the spirit and influence of the Gospel of
Jesus Christ? And should not all who wish well to the spread and
establishment of pure and undefiled religion, lift up their hand, their
influence, and their voice against them? The argument from their use in
the Jewish service is futile in the extreme when applied to
Christianity.
