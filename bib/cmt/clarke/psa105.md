### [Psalms Chapter 105](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 105:0</span></span>

An exhortation to praise God for his wondrous works, [Psa
105:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#001.md); his goodness to Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob, [Psa 105:6-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#006.md); to
Joseph in Egypt, [Psa 105:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#017.md); to
Israel in Egypt, [Psa 105:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#023.md); to
Moses in the same land, [Psa 105:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#026.md);
the plagues sent on the Egyptians, [Psa
105:27-36](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#027.md); the deliverance of the
Israelites out of Egypt, [Psa 105:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#037.md),
[Psa 105:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#038.md); how he supported them in
the wilderness, [Psa 105:39-43](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#039.md); and
brought them into Canaan, [Psa 105:44](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#044.md),
[Psa 105:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#045.md).

We find several verses of this Psalm in 1 Chronicles 16, from which it
is evident that David was the author of the principal part of it: but it
was probably enlarged and sung at the restoration of the people from the
Babylonish captivity. The hallelujah which terminates the preceding
Psalm, is made the title of this by the Vulgate, Septuagint, Ethiopic,
and Arabic: but it has no title either in the Hebrew or Chaldee. The
Syriac considers it a paraphrase on the words, "Fear not, Jacob, to go
down into Egypt; and teach us spiritually not to fear when we are
obliged to contend with devils; for God is our shield, and will fight
for us." The Psalm is a history of God's dealings with Abraham and his
posterity, till their settlement in the promised land.

[Psalms 105:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 105:1</span></span>

O give thanks - He had been meditating on God's gracious dealings with
their fathers; and he calls upon himself and all others to magnify God
for his mercies.

[Psalms 105:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 105:2</span></span>

Talk ye of all his wondrous works - נפלאתיו niphleothaiv, "of his
miracles." Who have so many of these to boast of as Christians!
Christianity is a tissue of miracles; and every part of the work of
grace on the soul is a miracle. Genuine Christian converts may talk of
miracles from morning to night; and they should talk of them, and
recommend to others their miracle-working God and Savior.

[Psalms 105:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 105:3</span></span>

Glory ye in his holy name - Show the name Jesus: exult in it - praise
it. His name was called Jesus; because he came to save his people from
their sins.

Let the heart of them rejoice - That is, the heart of those shall
rejoice who seek the Lord: therefore it is added: -

[Psalms 105:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 105:4</span></span>

Seek the Lord - Worship the one only Supreme Being, as the only and
all-sufficient good for the soul of man.

And his strength - Man is weak; and needs connection with the strong God
that he may be enabled to avoid evil and do good.

Seek his face - Reconciliation to him. Live not without a sense of his
favor.

Evermore - Let this be thy chief business. In and above all thy seeking,
seek this.

[Psalms 105:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 105:5</span></span>

Remember his marvellous works - Keep up communion with thy Maker, that
thou mayest neither forget him nor his works.

The judgments of his mouth - Whatsoever he has spoken concerning good or
evil. His commands, promises, threatenings; and particularly what he has
foretold, and what he has done.

[Psalms 105:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 105:6</span></span>

O ye seed of Abraham - Ye Jews especially, who have been the peculiar
objects of the Divine favor.

[Psalms 105:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 105:7</span></span>

He is the Lord our God - He is Jehovah, the self-existent and eternal
God. He is our God, he is our portion; has taken us for his people, and
makes us happy in his love.

The following abstract of the history of the Israelites presents but few
difficulties. See the notes on Psalm 78 (note).

[Psalms 105:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 105:12</span></span>

But a few men - When all appearances were against them, and nothing but
the arm of God could have brought them through their difficulties, and
given them a settlement in the promised land.

[Psalms 105:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 105:13</span></span>

When they went from one nation to another - From several circumstances
in the history of the travels of the ancient Hebrews, we find that the
wilderness through which they then passed was well peopled.

[Psalms 105:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 105:15</span></span>

Touch not mine anointed - It is supposed that the patriarchs are here
intended; but the whole people of Israel may be meant. They were a
kingdom of priests and kings unto God; and prophets, priests, and kings
were always anointed.

[Psalms 105:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 105:19</span></span>

Until the time that his word came - This appears to refer to the
completion of Joseph's interpretation of the dreams of the chief butler
and baker.

The Word of the Lord tried him - This seems to refer to the
interpretation of Pharaoh's dreams, called אמרת יהוה imrath Yehovah,
"the oracle of the Lord," because sent by him to Pharaoh. See [Gen
41:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#026.md), and Kennicott in loco.

[Psalms 105:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 105:25</span></span>

He turned their heart - "Their heart was turned." So the Syriac and
Arabic. After befriending the Hebrews on Joseph's account, to whom they
were so deeply indebted, finding them to multiply greatly in the land,
and at last to become more powerful than the Egyptians themselves, they
turned their attention to the adoption of measures, in order to prevent
the Hebrews from possessing themselves of the government of the whole
land; they curtailed them of their privileges, and endeavored to depress
them by all possible means, and by a variety of legal enactments. This
appears to be the sole meaning of the phrase, "He turned their heart;"
or, "their heart was turned."

[Psalms 105:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">psa 105:27</span></span>

They showed his signs - Here is a reference to the plagues with which
God afflicted the Egyptians. See Exodus 7-12 (note), [Psa
78:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#043) (note.md), and the notes on them.

[Psalms 105:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">psa 105:28</span></span>

They rebelled not against his word - Instead of ולא מרו velo maru, "they
rebelled," some think that a ש shin has been lost from before the word,
and that it should be read ולא שמרו velo shamru, "they did not observe
or keep his word." Or the words may be spoken of Moses and Aaron; they
received the commandment of God, and they did not rebel against it. They
believed what he had spoken, and acted according to his orders. It could
not be spoken of the Egyptians; for they rebelled against his words
through the whole course of the transactions.

[Psalms 105:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">psa 105:33</span></span>

He smote their vines also, and their fig trees - This is not mentioned
in Exodus; but we have had it before, [Psa
78:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#047.md).

[Psalms 105:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">psa 105:41</span></span>

He opened the rock, and the waters rushed out - See the note on [Exo
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#006.md), to which I can now add, that a
piece of this rock, broken off by the hand of my nephew, E. S. A.
Clarke, in the course of the present year \[1822,\] now lies before me.
It is fine granite; and so well distinguished as a granite, that the
feldt-spar, the mica, and the quartz, of which granite is composed,
appear very distinctly. It is worthy of remark, that, as granite is
supposed, in the most accredited systems of geology, to be the very
basis of the earth, the original rock, and all other substances to be
superimpositions upon it, and as the decompositions of the feldt-spar
produce pure vegetable earth, this rock should be used for this purpose,
and should be an emblem of Jesus Christ, the Creator and Redeemer of the
human race; and that it should signify him who is the basis of all
things; who upholds all by the word of his power; without whom nothing
is stable, nothing fruitful; from whom alone the water of life proceeds;
and in whose name only is salvation. And that rock (in the wilderness)
was Christ! and it is the only remaining emblem of him in creation.

[Psalms 105:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">psa 105:45</span></span>

That they might observe his statutes - That they might be properly
instructed, and properly disciplined. This is the end proposed by Divine
revelation: men are to be made wise unto salvation, and then to be
brought under the yoke of obedience. He who is not conformed to God's
word shall not enter into Christ's kingdom.
