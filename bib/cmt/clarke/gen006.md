### [Genesis Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 6:0</span></span>

The children of God, among whom the true religion was at first
preserved, corrupt it by forming matrimonial connections with
irreligious women, [Gen 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#001.md), [Gen
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#002.md). God, displeased with these
connections and their consequences, limits the continuance of the old
world to one hundred and twenty years, [Gen
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#003.md). The issue of those improper
connections termed giants, [Gen 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#004.md).
An affecting description of the depravity of the world, [Gen
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#005.md), [Gen
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#006.md). God threatens the destruction of
every living creature, [Gen 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#007.md). Noah
and his family find grace in his sight, [Gen
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#008.md). The character and family of Noah,
[Gen 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#009.md), [Gen
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#010.md). And a farther description of the
corruption of man, [Gen 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#011.md), [Gen
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#012.md). Noah is forewarned of the
approaching destruction of the human race, [Gen
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#013.md); and is ordered to build an ark
for the safety of himself and household, the form and dimensions of
which are particularly described, [Gen
6:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#014.md). The deluge threatened, [Gen
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#017.md). The covenant of God's mercy is
to be established between him and the family of Noah, [Gen
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#018.md). A male and female of all kinds
of animals that could not live in the waters to be brought into the ark,
[Gen 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#019.md), [Gen
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#020.md). Noah is commanded to provide
food for their sustenance, [Gen 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#021.md);
and punctually follows all these directions, [Gen
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#022.md).

[Genesis 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 6:1</span></span>

When men began to multiply - It was not at this time that men began to
multiply, but the inspired penman speaks now of a fact which had taken
place long before. As there is a distinction made here between men and
those called the sons of God, it is generally supposed that the
immediate posterity of Cain and that of Seth are intended. The first
were mere men, such as fallen nature may produce, degenerate sons of a
degenerate father, governed by the desire of the flesh, the desire of
the eye, and the pride of life. The others were sons of God, not angels,
as some have dreamed, but such as were, according to our Lord's
doctrine, born again, born from above, [Joh
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#003.md), [Joh
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#005.md),[Joh
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#006.md), etc., and made children of God by
the influence of the Holy Spirit, [Gal
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#006.md). The former were apostates from
the true religion, the latter were those among whom it was preserved and
cultivated. Dr. Wall supposes the first verses of this chapter should be
paraphrased thus: "When men began to multiply on the earth, the chief
men took wives of all the handsome poor women they chose. There were
tyrants in the earth in those days; and also after the antediluvian days
powerful men had unlawful connections with the inferior women, and the
children which sprang from this illicit commerce were the renowned
heroes of antiquity, of whom the heathens made their gods."

[Genesis 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 6:3</span></span>

My spirit shall not always strive - It is only by the influence of the
Spirit of God that the carnal mind can be subdued and destroyed; but
those who wilfully resist and grieve that Spirit must be ultimately left
to the hardness and blindness of their own hearts, if they do not repent
and turn to God. God delights in mercy, and therefore a gracious warning
is given. Even at this time the earth was ripe for destruction; but God
promised them one hundred and twenty years' respite: if they repented in
that interim, well; if not, they should be destroyed by a flood. See the
note on [Gen 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#005.md)

[Genesis 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 6:4</span></span>

There were giants in the earth - נפלים nephilim, from נפל naphal, "he
fell." Those who had apostatized or fallen from the true religion. The
Septuagint translate the original word by γιγαντες, which literally
signifies earth-born, and which we, following them, term giants, without
having any reference to the meaning of the word, which we generally
conceive to signify persons of enormous stature. But the word when
properly understood makes a very just distinction between the sons of
men and the sons of God; those were the nephilim, the fallen earth-born
men, with the animal and devilish mind. These were the sons of God, who
were born from above; children of the kingdom, because children of God.
Hence we may suppose originated the different appellatives given to
sinners and saints; the former were termed γιγαντες, earth-born, and the
latter, ἁγιοι, i.e. saints, persons not of the earth, or separated from
the earth.

The same became mighty men - men of renown - גברים gibborim, which we
render mighty men, signifies properly conquerors, heroes, from גבר
gabar, "he prevailed, was victorious." and אנשי השם anshey hashshem,
"men of the name," ανθρωποι ονομαστοι, Septuagint; the same as we render
men of renown, renominati, twice named, as the word implies, having one
name which they derived from their fathers, and another which they
acquired by their daring exploits and enterprises.

It may be necessary to remark here that our translators have rendered
seven different Hebrew words by the one term giants, viz., nephilim,
gibborim, enachim, rephaim, emim, and zamzummim; by which appellatives
are probably meant in general persons of great knowledge, piety,
courage, wickedness, etc., and not men of enormous stature, as is
generally conjectured.

[Genesis 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 6:5</span></span>

The wickedness of man was great - What an awful character does God give
of the inhabitants of the antediluvian world! 1. They were flesh, ([Gen
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#003).md), wholly sensual, the desires of
the mind overwhelmed and lost in the desires of the flesh, their souls
no longer discerning their high destiny, but ever minding earthly
things, so that they were sensualized, brutalized, and become flesh;
incarnated so as not to retain God in their knowledge, and they lived,
seeking their portion in this life. 2. They were in a state of
wickedness. All was corrupt within, and all unrighteous without; neither
the science nor practice of religion existed. Piety was gone, and every
form of sound words had disappeared. 3. This wickedness was great רבה
rabbah, "was multiplied;" it was continually increasing and multiplying
increase by increase, so that the whole earth was corrupt before God,
and was filled with violence, ([Gen
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#011).md); profligacy among the lower, and
cruelty and oppression among the higher classes, being only predominant.
4. All the imaginations of their thoughts were evil - the very first
embryo of every idea, the figment of every thought, the very materials
out of which perception, conception, and ideas were formed, were all
evil; the fountain which produced them, with every thought, purpose,
wish, desire, and motive, was incurably poisoned. 5. All these were evil
without any mixture of good - the Spirit of God which strove with them
was continually resisted, so that evil had its sovereign sway. 6. They
were evil continually - there was no interval of good, no moment allowed
for serious reflection, no holy purpose, no righteous act. What a
finished picture of a fallen soul! Such a picture as God alone, who
searches the heart and tries the spirit, could possibly give. 7. To
complete the whole, God represents himself as repenting because he had
made them, and as grieved at the heart because of their iniquities! Had
not these been voluntary transgressions, crimes which they might have
avoided, had they not grieved and quenched the Spirit of God, could he
speak of them in the manner he does here? 8. So incensed is the most
holy and the most merciful God, that he is determined to destroy the
work of his hands: And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have
created; [Gen 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#007.md). How great must the
evil have been, and how provoking the transgressions, which obliged the
most compassionate God, for the vindication of his own glory, to form
this awful purpose! Fools make a mock at sin, but none except fools.

[Genesis 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 6:8</span></span>

Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord - Why? Because he was, 1. A
just man, איש צדיק ish tsaddik, a man who gave to all their due; for
this is the ideal meaning of the original word. 2. He was perfect in his
generation - he was in all things a consistent character, never
departing from the truth in principle or practice. 3. He walked with God
- he was not only righteous in his conduct, but he was pious, and had
continual communion with God. The same word is used here as before in
the case of Enoch. See [Gen 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#022.md).

[Genesis 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 6:11</span></span>

The earth also was corrupt - See the note on [Gen
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#005.md).

[Genesis 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 6:13</span></span>

I will destroy them with the earth - Not only the human race was to he
destroyed, but all terrestrial animals, i.e. those which could not live
in the waters. These must necessarily be destroyed when the whole
surface of the earth was drowned. But destroying the earth may probably
mean the alteration of its constitution. Dr. Woodward, in his natural
history of the earth, has rendered it exceedingly probable that the
whole terrestrial substance was amalgamated with the waters, after which
the different materials of its composition settled in beds or strata
according to their respective gravities. This theory, however, is
disputed by others.

[Genesis 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 6:14</span></span>

Make thee an ark - תבת tebath, a word which is used only to express this
vessel, and that in which Moses was preserved, [Exo
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#003.md), [Exo
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#005.md). It signifies no more than our
word vessel in its common acceptation - a hollow place capable of
containing persons, goods, etc., without any particular reference to
shape or form.

Gopher wood - Some think the cedar is meant; others, the cypress.
Bochart renders this probable, 1. From the appellation, supposing the
Greek word κυπαρισσος, cypress, was formed from the Hebrew גפר, gopher;
for take away the termination ισσος, and then gopher and κυπαρ will have
a near resemblance. 2. Because the cypress is not liable to rot, nor to
be injured by worms. 3. The cypress was anciently used for
ship-building. 4. This wood abounded in Assyria, where it is probable
Noah built the ark. After all, the word is of doubtful signification,
and occurs nowhere else in the Scriptures. The Septuagint render the
place, εκ ξυλων τετραγωνων, "of square timber;" and the Vulgate, de
lignis laevigatis, "of planed timber;" so it is evident that these
translators knew not what kind of wood was intended by the original. The
Syriac and Arabic trifle with the passage, rendering it wicker work, as
if the ark had been a great basket! Both the Targums render it cedar;
and the Persian, pine or fir.

[Genesis 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 6:15</span></span>

Thou shalt make - the length of the ark - three hundred cubits, the
breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits -
Allowing the cubit, which is the length from the elbow to the tip of the
middle finger, to be eighteen inches, the ark must have been four
hundred and fifty feet in length, seventy-five in breadth, and
forty-five in height. But that the ancient cubit was more than eighteen
inches has been demonstrated by Mr. Greaves, who traveled in Greece,
Palestine, and Egypt, in order to be able to ascertain the weights,
moneys, and measures of antiquity. He measured the pyramids in Egypt,
and comparing the accounts which Herodotus, Strabo, and others, give of
their size, he found the length of a cubit to be twenty-one inches and
eight hundred and eighty-eight decimal parts out of a thousand, or
nearly twenty-two inches. Hence the cube of a cubit is evidently ten
thousand four hundred and eighty-six inches. And from this it will
appear that the three hundred cubits of the ark's length make five
hundred and forty-seven feet; the fifty for its breadth, ninety-one feet
two inches; and the thirty for its height, fifty-four feet eight inches.
When these dimensions are examined, the ark will be found to be a vessel
whose capacity was more than sufficient to contain all persons and
animals said to have been in it, with sufficient food for each for more
than twelve months. This vessel Dr. Arbuthnot computes to have been
eighty-one thousand and sixty-two tons in burden.

As many have supposed the capacity of the ark to have been much too
small for the things which were contained in it, it will be necessary to
examine this subject thoroughly, that every difficulty may be removed.
The things contained in the ark, besides the eight persons of Noah's
family, were one pair of all unclean animals, and seven pairs of all
clean animals with provisions for all sufficient for twelve months.

At the first view the number of animals may appear so immense that no
space but the forest could be thought sufficient to contain them. If,
however, we come to a calculation, the number of the different genera or
kinds of animals will be found much less than is generally imagined. It
is a question whether in this account any but the different genera of
animals necessary to be brought into the ark should be included
Naturalists have divided the whole system of zoology into Classes and
Orders, containing genera and species. There are six classes thus
denominated:

1\. Mammalia;

2\. Aves;

3\. Amphibia;

4\. Pisces;

5\. Insectae;

6\. Vermes.

With the three last of these, viz., fishes, insects, and worms, the
question can have little to do.

The first Class, Mammalia, or animals with teats, contains seven orders,
and only forty-three genera if we except the seventh order, cete, i.e.
all the whale kind, which certainly need not come into this account. The
different species in this class amount, the cete excluded, to five
hundred and forty-three.

The second Class, Aves, birds, contains six orders, and only
seventy-four genera, if we exclude the third order, anseres, or
web-footed fowls, all of which could very well live in the water. The
different species in this class, the anseres excepted, amount to two
thousand three hundred and seventy-two.

The third Class, Amphibia, contains only two orders, reptiles and
serpents; these comprehend ten genera, and three hundred and sixty-six
species, but of the reptiles many could live in the water, such as the
tortoise, frog, etc. Of the former there are thirty-three species, of
the latter seventeen, which excluded reduce the number to three hundred
and sixteen. The whole of these would occupy but little room in the ark,
for a small portion of earth, etc., in the hold would be sufficient for
their accommodation.

Bishop Wilkins, who has written largely and with his usual accuracy on
this subject, supposes that quadrupeds do not amount to one hundred
different kinds, nor birds which could not live in the water to two
hundred. Of quadrupeds he shows that only seventy-two species needed a
place in the ark, and the birds he divides into nine classes, including
in the whole one hundred and ninety-five kinds, from which all the
web-footed should be deducted, as these could live in the water.

He computes all the carnivorous animals equivalent, as to the bulk of
their bodies and food, to twenty-seven wolves; and all the rest to one
hundred and eighty oxen. For the former he allows one thousand eight
hundred and twenty-five sheep for their annual consumption; and for the
latter, one hundred and nine thousand five hundred cubits of hay: these
animals and their food will be easily contained In the two first
stories, and much room to spare; as to the third story, no person can
doubt its being sufficient for the fowls, with Noah and his family.

One sheep each day he judges will be sufficient for six wolves; and a
square cubit of hay, which contains forty-one pounds, as ordinarily
pressed in our ricks, will he amply sufficient for one ox in the day.
When the quantum of room which these animals and their provender
required for one year, is compared with the capacity of the ark, we
shall be led to conclude, with the learned bishop, "that of the two it
is more difficult to assign a number and bulk of necessary things to
answer to the capacity of the ark, than to find sufficient room for the
several species of animals and their food already known to have been
there." This he attributes to the imperfection of our lists of animals,
especially those of the unknown parts of the earth; and adds, "that the
most expert mathematicians at this day," and he was one of the first in
Europe, "could not assign the proportion of a vessel better accommodated
to the purpose than is here done;" and concludes thus: "The capacity of
the ark, which has been made an objection against Scripture, ought to be
esteemed a confirmation of its Divine authority; since, in those ruder
ages men, being less versed in arts and philosophy, were more obnoxious
to vulgar prejudices than now, so that had it been a human invention it
would have been contrived, according to those wild apprehensions which
arise from a confused and general view of things, as much too big as it
has been represented too little." See Bishop Wilkins's Essay towards a
Philosophical Character and Language.

[Genesis 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 6:16</span></span>

A window shalt thou make - What this was cannot be absolutely
ascertained. The original word צהר tsohar signifies clear or bright; the
Septuagint translate it by επωυναγων, "collecting, thou shalt make the
ark," which plainly shows they did not understand the word as signifying
any kind of window or light. Symmacbus translates it διαφανες, a
transparency; and Aquila, μεσημβρινον, the noon. Jonathan ben Uzziel
supposes that it was a precious luminous stone which Noah, by Divine
command, brought from the river Pison. It is probably a word which
should be taken in a collective sense, signifying apertures for air and
light.

In a cubit shalt thou finish it above - Probably meaning that the roof
should be left a cubit broad at the apex or top, and that it should not
terminate in a sharp ridge. But this place is variously understood.

[Genesis 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 6:17</span></span>

I-do bring a flood - מבול; mabbul; a word used only to designate the
general deluge, being never applied to signify any other kind of
inundation; and does not the Holy Spirit intend to show by this that no
other flood was ever like this, and that it should continue to be the
sole one of the kind? There have been many partial inundations in
various countries, but never more than One general deluge; and we have
God's promise, [Gen 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#015.md), that there
shall never be another.

[Genesis 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 6:18</span></span>

With thee will I establish my covenant - The word ברית berith, from בר
bar, to purify or cleanse, signifies properly a purification or
purifier, (see on Genesis 15 (note)), because in all covenants made
between God and man, sin and sinfulness were ever supposed to be on
man's side, and that God could not enter into any covenant or engagement
with him without a purifier; hence, in all covenants, a sacrifice was
offered for the removal of offenses, and the reconciliation of God to
the sinner; and hence the word ברית berith signifies not only a
covenant, but also the sacrifice offered on the occasion, [Exo
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#008.md); [Psa
50:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#005.md); and Jesus Christ, the great
atonement and purifier, has the same word for his title, [Isa
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#006.md); [Isa
49:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#008.md); and [Zac
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#011.md).

Almost all nations, in forming alliances, etc., made their covenants or
contracts in the same way. A sacrifice was provided, its throat was cut,
and its blood poured out before God; then the whole carcass was divided
through the spinal marrow from the head to the rump; so as to make
exactly two equal parts; these were placed opposite to each other, and
the contracting parties passed between them, or entering at opposite
ends met in the center, and there took the covenant oath. This is
particularly referred to by Jeremiah, [Jer
34:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#018.md), [Jer
34:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#019.md), [Jer
34:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#020.md) : "I will give the men (into the
hands of their enemies, [Jer 34:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#020).md)
that have transgressed my covenant, which have not performed the words
of the covenant which they made before me, when they cut the calf in
twain, and passed between the parts thereof," etc. See also [Deu
29:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#012.md).

A covenant, says Mr. Ainsworth, is a disposition of good things
faithfully declared, which God here calls his, as arising from his grace
towards Noah ([Gen 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#008).md) and all men;
but implying also conditions on man's part, and therefore is called our
covenant, [Zac 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#011.md). The apostles call
it διαθηκη, a testament or disposition; and it is mixed of the
properties both of covenant and testament, as the apostle shows, [Heb
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#016.md), etc., and of both may be named a
testamental covenant, whereby the disposing of God's favors and good
things to us is declared. The covenant made with Noah signified, on
God's part, that he should save Noah and his family from death by the
ark. On Noah's part, that he should in faith and obedience make and
enter into the ark - Thou shalt come into the ark, etc., so committing
himself to God's preservation, [Heb
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#007.md). And under this the covenant or
testament of eternal salvation by Christ was also implied, the apostle
testifying, [Pe1 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#021.md), that the
antitype, baptism, doth also now save us; for baptism is a seal of our
salvation, [Mar 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#016.md). To provide a
Savior, and the means of salvation, is God's part: to accept this
Savior, laying hold on the hope set before us, is ours. Those who refuse
the way and means of salvation must perish; those who accept of the
great Covenant Sacrifice cannot perish, but shall have eternal life. See
on [Gen 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#010) (note.md), etc.

[Genesis 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gen 6:19</span></span>

To keep them alive - God might have destroyed all the animal creation,
and created others to occupy the new world, but he chose rather to
preserve those already created. The Creator and Preserver of the
universe does nothing but what is essentially necessary to be done.
Nothing should be wantonly wasted; nor should power or skill be lavished
where no necessity exists; and yet it required more means and economy to
preserve the old than to have created new ones. Such respect has God to
the work of his hands, that nothing but what is essential to the credit
of his justice and holiness shall ever induce him to destroy any thing
he has made.

[Genesis 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 6:21</span></span>

Of all food that is eaten - That is, of the food proper for every
species of animals.

[Genesis 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 6:22</span></span>

Thus did Noah - He prepared the ark; and during one hundred and twenty
years preached righteousness to that sinful generation, [Pe2
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#005.md). And this we are informed, [Pe1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#018.md), [Pe1
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#019.md), etc., he did by the Spirit of
Christ; for it was only through him that the doctrine of repentance
could ever be successfully preached. The people in Noah's time are
represented as shut up in prison - arrested and condemned by God's
justice, but graciously allowed the space of one hundred and twenty
years to repent in. This respite was an act of great mercy; and no doubt
thousands who died in the interim availed themselves of it, and believed
to the saving of their souls. But the great majority of the people did
not, else the flood had never come.
