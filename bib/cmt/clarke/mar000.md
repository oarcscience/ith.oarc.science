Preface to the Gospel According to St. MarkWith a Short Account of His
Life

For an explication of the word Gospel, and the title Saint, see the
Preface to Matthew.

Mark. This person, the second in the commonly received order of the four
evangelists, was named John Mark, and was the son of a pious woman
called Mary, who dwelt at Jerusalem: she was an early believer, and the
disciples used to meet at her house. Peter, having been delivered out of
prison by an angel, came to the house of Mary, mother of John, whose
surname was Mark, where many were gathered together praying, [Act
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#012.md). This very first mention of John
Mark assures us of Peter's intimacy in that family: it is almost
universally allowed that Mark, mentioned by Peter, [Pe1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#013.md), is this evangelist, and that he
is the same with him who is called sister's son to Barnabas, [Col
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010.md), and is supposed to have been
converted by Peter to the Christian faith. Mr. W. Whiston supposes him
to have been Peter's own son. See his Primitive New Test. Notes at the
end. He traveled from Jerusalem to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas, [Act
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#025.md), and some short time after he
accompanied them to other countries as their minister, [Act
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#005.md). When they returned to the
continent, and came on shore at Perga in Pamphylia, he departed from
them and returned to Jerusalem, [Act
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#013.md). Afterwards he would have gone
with Paul and Barnabas, but the former refused to take him, because of
his having left them at Pamphylia; Paul and Barnabas then separated, and
Mark accompanied his uncle Barnabas to Cyprus, [Act
15:36-41](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#036.md). Afterwards Paul and he were
fully reconciled, as evidently appears from [Ti2
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#011.md) : Take Mark, and bring him with
thee; for he is profitable to me for the ministry. This appears also
from [Plm 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#024.md), where Mark is styled
Paul's fellow-laborer; and from [Col
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010.md), where we find the apostle
recommending him in a particular manner to the Church of God at that
place. He is generally supposed to have been particularly intimate with
St. Peter, to have written his Gospel at Rome, a.d. 64, and to have died
at Alexandria in Egypt, in the eighth year of the reign of Nero. Dr.
Lardner has fully proved that Mark the evangelist, and John Mark nephew
to Barnabas, were one and the same person. See his Works, vol. vi. p.
77, etc.

How Mark composed his Gospel, is a question not yet decided among
learned men. Many of the primitive fathers, such as Papias, Clemens,
Alexandrinus, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Origen, Eusebius, etc., believed
that he was only the amanuensis of St. Peter; that this apostle, through
modesty, would not put his name to the work, but dictated the whole
account, and Mark wrote it down from his mouth. St. Augustine appears to
have been the first who maintained that Mark abridged St. Matthew's
Gospel; and that it is not to be considered as an original work: - on
this opinion several remarks will be made in the course of these notes.
Others suppose that Mark compiled it, partly out of Matthew's Gospel,
and partly out of the Gospel of Luke. But most of these are conjectures
which appear to have very little foundation. Critics are also divided
concerning the language in which it was written, and the people to whom
it was sent. Some have contended for a Latin original, because of
several Latin words found in it, such as σπεκουλατωρ, [Mar
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#027.md), one of the guard; κεντυριων,
[Mar 15:39](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#039.md), [Mar
15:44](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#044.md), [Mar
15:46](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#046.md), a centurion, a captain of one
hundred men; συσσημον, [Mar 14:44](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#044.md), a
signal, a sign agreed on. But such words are better accounted for by
supposing that his Gospel was written for the use of the Roman people;
and that it is on this account that he wholly passes by the genealogy of
our Lord, as being a point of no consequence to Gentile converts, though
very necessary for the Jews, and especially the Jews of Palestine. That
it was originally written in Greek, is a point now acknowledged by
almost all learned men.

It may be necessary to state the things omitted by Mark in the beginning
of his Gospel which are mentioned by Matthew and Luke.

1\. The Preface, found in Luke and John, [Luk
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md); [Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md).

2\. The Conception of Elizabeth, Luke 1:5-25.

3\. The Salutation of Mary, [Luk
1:26-38](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#026.md).

4\. Mary's Visit to Elizabeth, Luke 1:39-56.

5\. John Baptist's Birth, Luke 1:57-79.

6\. The Angel's Appearance to Joseph, [Mat
1:18-25](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#018.md).

7\. The Birth of Christ, [Mat 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#025.md);
[Luk 2:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001.md).

8\. The Genealogy of Christ, Matthew 1:1-17; Luke 3:23-38.

9\. The Appearance of the Angel to the Shepherds, [Luk
2:8-20](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#008.md).

10\. The Circumcision of Christ, [Mat
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#025.md); [Luk
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#021.md).

11\. The Presentation of Christ in the Temple, Luke 2:22-38.

12\. The Coming of the Magi, [Mat
2:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#001.md).

13\. The Flight into Egypt, [Mat
2:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#013.md).

14\. Herod's Murder of the Innocents, [Mat
2:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#016.md).

15\. The Return of the Holy Family from Egypt, [Mat
2:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#019.md); [Luk
2:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#039.md).

16\. Christ's Journey to Jerusalem when twelve years of age, [Luk
2:40-48](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#040.md).

From the particulars enumerated here, it appears that the things omitted
by Mark are also omitted by John, except the Preface; and that St. Luke
is the most circumstantial.

For other particulars relative to this Gospel, see at the end of the
last chapter.
