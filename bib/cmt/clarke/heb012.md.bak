### [Hebrews Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001.md)

[Hebrews](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">heb 12:0</span></span>

Having so many incitements to holiness, patience, and perseverance, we
should lay aside every hinderance, and run with patience the race that
is set before us, taking our blessed Lord for our example, [Heb
12:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001.md). These sufferings are to be
considered as fatherly chastisements from God, and to be patiently
submitted to on account of the benefits to be derived from them, [Heb
12:5-11](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#005.md). They should take courage and
go forward, [Heb 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#012.md), [Heb
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#013.md). Directions to follow peace with
all men, and to take heed that they fall not from the grace of God, [Heb
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#014.md), [Heb
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#015.md). References to the case of Esau,
[Heb 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#016.md), [Heb
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#017.md). The privileges of Christians,
compared with those of the Jews, by which the superior excellence of
Christianity is shown, [Heb 12:18-24](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#018.md).
They must take care not to reject Jesus, who now addressed them from
heaven, and who was shortly to be their Judge, [Heb
12:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#025.md). As they were called to
receive a kingdom, they should have grace, whereby they might serve God
acceptably, [Heb 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#028.md), [Heb
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#029.md).

[Hebrews 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 12:1</span></span>

Wherefore - This is an inference drawn from the examples produced in the
preceding chapter, and on this account both should be read in
connection.

Compassed about - Here is another allusion to the Olympic games: the
agonistae, or contenders, were often greatly animated by the
consideration that the eyes of the principal men of their country were
fixed upon them; and by this they were induced to make the most
extraordinary exertions.

Cloud of witnesses - Νεφος μαρτυρων. Both the Greeks and Latins
frequently use the term cloud, to express a great number of persons or
things; so in Euripides, Phoeniss. ver. 257: νεφος ασπιδων πυκνον, a
dense cloud of shields; and Statius, Thebiad., lib. ix., ver. 120:
jaculantum nubes, a cloud of spearmen. The same metaphor frequently
occurs.

Let us lay aside every weight - As those who ran in the Olympic races
would throw aside every thing that might impede them in their course; so
Christians, professing to go to heaven, must throw aside every thing
that might hinder them in their Christian race. Whatever weighs down our
hearts or affections to earth and sense is to be carefully avoided; for
no man, with the love of the world in his heart, can ever reach the
kingdom of heaven.

The sin which doth so easily beset - Ευπεριστατον ἁμαρτιαν· The well
circumstanced sin; that which has every thing in its favor, time, and
place, and opportunity; the heart and the object; and a sin in which all
these things frequently occur, and consequently the transgression is
frequently committed. Ευπεριστατος is derived from ευ, well, περι,
about, and ἱστημι, I stand; the sin that stands well, or is favorably
situated, ever surrounding the person and soliciting his acquiescence.
What we term the easily besetting sin is the sin of our constitution,
the sin of our trade, that in which our worldly honor, secular profit,
and sensual gratification are most frequently felt and consulted. Some
understand it of original sin, as that by which we are enveloped in
body, soul, and spirit. Whatever it may be, the word gives us to
understand that it is what meets us at every turn; that it is always
presenting itself to us; that as a pair of compasses describe a circle
by the revolution of one leg, while the other is at rest in the center,
so this, springing from that point of corruption within, called the
carnal mind, surrounds us in every place; we are bounded by it, and
often hemmed in on every side; it is a circular, well fortified wall,
over which we must leap, or through which we must break. The man who is
addicted to a particular species of sin (for every sinner has his way)
is represented as a prisoner in this strong fortress.

In laying aside the weight, there is an allusion to the long garments
worn in the eastern countries, which, if not laid aside or tucked up in
the girdle, would greatly incommode the traveler, and utterly prevent a
man from running a race. The easily besetting sin of the Hebrews was an
aptness to be drawn aside from their attachment to the Gospel, for fear
of persecution.

Let us run with patience the race - Τρεχωμεν τον προκειμενον ἡμιν αγωνα·
Let us start, run on, and continue running, till we get to the goal.
This figure is a favourite among the Greek writers; so Euripides,
Alcest., ver. 489: Ου τον δ' αγωνα πρωτον αν δραμοιμ' εγω· This is not
the first race that I shall run. Id. Iphig. in Aulid., ver. 1456:
Δεινους αγωνας δια σε κεινον δει δραμειν· He must run a hard race for
thee. This is a race which is of infinite moment to us: the prize is
ineffably great; and, if we lose it, it is not a simple loss, for the
whole soul perishes.

[Hebrews 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 12:2</span></span>

Looking unto Jesus - Αφορωντες· Looking off and on, or from and to;
looking off or from the world and all secular concerns to Jesus and all
the spiritual and heavenly things connected with him. This is still an
allusion to the Grecian games: those who ran were to keep their eyes
fixed on the mark of the prize; they must keep the goal in view. The
exhortation implies,

1\. That they should place all their hope and confidence in Christ, as
their sole helper in this race of faith.

2\. That they should consider him their leader in this contest and
imitate his example.

The author and finisher of - faith - Αρχηγος, translated here author,
signifies, in general, captain or leader, or the first inventor of a
thing; see [Heb 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010.md). But the
reference seems to be here to the βραβευς, or judge in the games, whose
business it was to admit the contenders, and to give the prize to the
conqueror. Jesus is here represented as this officer; every Christian is
a contender in this race of life, and for eternal life. The heavenly
course is begun under Jesus; and under him it is completed. He is the
finisher, by awarding the prize to them that are faithful unto death.
Thus he is the author or the judge under whom, and by whose permission
and direction, according to the rules of the heavenly race, they are
permitted to enter the lists, and commence the race, and he is the
finisher, τελειωτης, the perfecter, by awarding and giving the prize
which consummates the combatants at the end of the race.

Who, for the joy that was set before him - The joy of fulfilling the
will of the Father, [Psa 40:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md), etc.,
in tasting death for every man; and having endured the cross and
despised the shame of this ignominious death, He is set down at the
right hand of God, ever appearing in the presence of God for us, and
continuing his exhibition of himself as our Sacrifice, and his
intercession as our Mediator. See the notes on [Heb
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005.md), etc. There are different other
explanations given of this clause, but I think that here offered is the
most natural. It never can, in any sense, be said of Jesus that he
endured the cross, etc., in the prospect of gaining an everlasting
glory; when he had the fullness of that glory with the Father before the
world began; [Joh 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#005.md).

[Hebrews 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 12:3</span></span>

For consider him - Αναλογισασθε - ἱνα μη καμητε, ταις ψυχαις -
εκλυμενοι· Attentively observe and analyze every part of his conduct,
enter into his spirit, examine his motives and object, and remember
that, as he acted, ye are called to act; he will furnish you with the
same Spirit, and will support you with the same strength. He bore a
continual opposition of sinners against himself; but he conquered by
meekness, patience, and perseverance: he has left you an example that ye
should follow his steps. If ye trust in him, ye shall receive strength;
therefore, howsoever great your opposition may be, ye shall not be
weary: if ye confide in and attentively look to him, ye shall have
continual courage to go on, and never faint in your minds.

Here is a continued allusion to the contenders in the Grecian games,
who, when exhausted in bodily strength and courage, yielded the palm to
their opponents, and were said καμνειν, to be weary or exhausted;
εκλυεσθαι, to be dissolved, disheartened, or to have lost all bravery
and courage.

[Hebrews 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 12:4</span></span>

Ye have not yet resisted unto blood - Many of those already mentioned
were martyrs for the truth; they persevered unto death, and lost their
lives in bearing testimony to the truth. Though you have had opposition
and persecution, yet you have not been called, in bearing your testimony
against sin and sinners, to seal the truth with your blood.

Striving against sin - Προς την ἁμαρτιαν ανταγωνι ζομενοι· An allusion
to boxing at the Grecian games. In the former passages the apostle
principally refers to the foot races.

[Hebrews 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 12:5</span></span>

And ye have forgotten - Or, have ye forgotten the exhortation? This
quotation is made from [Pro 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#011.md), [Pro
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#012.md), and shows that the address
there, which at first sight appears to be from Solomon to his son, or
from some fatherly man to a person in affliction, is properly from God
himself to any person in persecution, affliction, or distress.

Despise not thou the chastening - Μη ολιγωρει παιδειας Κυριου· Do not
neglect the correction of the Lord. That man neglects correction, and
profits not by it, who does not see the hand of God in it; or, in other
words, does not fear the rod and him who hath appointed it, and,
consequently, does not humble himself under the mighty hand of God,
deplore his sin, deprecate Divine judgment, and pray for mercy.

Nor faint - Do not be discouraged nor despair, for the reasons
immediately alleged.

[Hebrews 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 12:6</span></span>

For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth - Here is the reason why we
should neither neglect correction, nor faint under it: it is a proof of
the fatherly love of God Almighty, and shows his most gracious designs
towards us; from which we may be fully convinced that the affliction
will prove the means of good to our souls, if we make a proper use of
it.

And scourgeth every son whom he receiveth - Μαστιγοι δε παντα υἱον, ὁν
παραδεχεται. This is a quotation, literatim from the Septuagint, of [Pro
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#012.md), of which place our version is:
Even as the father the son in whom he delighteth. But, howsoever near
this may appear to be the Hebrew, it bears scarcely any affinity to the
apostle's words. The Hebrew text is as follows: וכאב את־בן ירצה uchab
eth-ben yirtseh. Now, וכאב may be a noun, compounded of the conjunction
ו vau, "and," the comparative particle כ ke, "as" or "like;" and אב ab,
"a father:" or it may be the third person preterite kal of כאב caab, "he
spoiled, wasted, marred, ulcerated," compounded with the conjunction ו
vau, "and." And in this sense the Septuagint most evidently understood
it; and it is so understood by the Arabic; and both readings seem to be
combined by the Syriac and Chaldee versions. And as to רצה ratsah, one
of its prime meanings is to accept, to receive graciously, to take into
favor; the translation, therefore, of the Septuagint and apostle is
perfectly consonant to the Hebrew text, and our version of [Pro
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#012.md) is wrong.

[Hebrews 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 12:7</span></span>

If ye endure chastening - If ye submit to his authority, humble
yourselves under his hand, and pray for his blessing, you will find that
he deals with you as beloved children, correcting you that he may make
you partakers of his holiness.

God dealeth with you as with sons - He acknowledges by this that you
belong to the family, and that he, as your Father, has you under proper
discipline. It is a maxim among the Jewish rabbins that "the love which
is not conjoined with reproof is not genuine."

[Hebrews 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 12:8</span></span>

Then are ye bastards - This proceeds on the general fact, that bastards
are neglected in their manners and education; the fathers of such,
feeling little affection for, or obligation to regard, their spurious
issue. But all that are legitimate children are partakers of
chastisement or discipline; for the original word παιδεια does not imply
stripes and punishments, but the whole discipline of a child, both at
home and at school.

[Hebrews 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 12:9</span></span>

We have had fathers of our flesh - The fathers of our flesh, i.e. our
natural parents, were correctors; and we reverenced them,
notwithstanding their corrections often arose from whim or caprice: but
shall we not rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits; to him
from whom we have received both body and soul; who is our Creator,
Preserver, and Supporter; to whom both we and our parents owe our life
and our blessings; and who corrects us only for our profit; that we may
live and be partakers of his holiness? The apostle in asking, Shall we
not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?
alludes to the punishment of the stubborn and rebellious son, [Deu
21:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#018.md) : "If a man have a stubborn
and rebellious son, who will not obey the voice of his father, or the
voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not
hearken unto them; then shall his father and mother lay hold on him and
bring him to the elders of the city, and they shall say, This our son is
stubborn and rebellious; he will not obey our voice: and all the men of
the city shall stone him with stones that he Die." Had he been subject
to his earthly parents, he would have lived; because not subject, he
dies. If we be subject to our heavenly Father, we shall Live, and be
partakers of his holiness; if not, we shall Die, and be treated as
bastards and not sons. This is the sum of the apostle's meaning; and the
fact and the law to which he alludes.

[Hebrews 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 12:10</span></span>

For - a few days - The chastisement of our earthly parents lasted only a
short time; that of our heavenly Father will also be but a short time,
if we submit: and as our parents ceased to correct when we learned
obedience; so will our heavenly Father when the end for which he sent
the chastisement is accomplished. God delights not in the rod; judgment
is his strange work.

[Hebrews 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 12:11</span></span>

No chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous - Neither correction,
wholesome restraint, domestic regulations, nor gymnastic discipline, are
pleasant to them that are thus exercised; but it is by these means that
obedient children, scholars, and great men are made. And it is by God's
discipline that Christians are made. He who does not bear the yoke of
Christ is good for nothing to others, and never gains rest to his own
soul.

The peaceable fruit of righteousness - i.e. The joyous, prosperous
fruits; those fruits by which we gain much, and through which we are
made happy.

Exercised thereby - Γεγυμνασμενοις· To the trained. There is still an
allusion to the Grecian games; and in the word before us to those
gymnastic exercises by which the candidates for the prizes were trained
to the different kinds of exercises in which they were to contend when
the games were publicly opened.

[Hebrews 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 12:12</span></span>

Wherefore lift up the hands - The apostle refers to [Isa
35:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#003.md). The words are an address to
persons almost worn out with sickness and fatigue, whose hands hang
down, whose knees shake, and who are totally discouraged. These are
exhorted to exert themselves, and take courage, with the assurance that
they shall infallibly conquer if they persevere.

[Hebrews 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 12:13</span></span>

Make straight paths for your feet - That is, Take the straight path that
is before you, do not go in crooked or rough ways, where are stones,
briers, and thorns, by which you will be inevitably lamed, and so
totally prevented from proceeding in the way; whereas, if you go in the
even, proper path, though you have been wounded by getting into a wrong
way, that which was wounded will be healed by moderate, equal exercise,
all impediments being removed. The application of all this to a correct,
holy deportment in religious life, is both natural and easy.

[Hebrews 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 12:14</span></span>

Follow peace with all men - Cultivate, as far as you possibly can, a
good understanding, both with Jews and Gentiles. Ειρηνην διωκετε, pursue
peace with the same care, attention, and diligence, as beasts do their
game; follow it through all places; trace it through all winding
circumstances; and have it with all men, if you can with a safe
conscience.

And holiness - Τον ἁγιασμον· That state of continual sanctification,
that life of purity and detachment from the world and all its lusts,
without which detachment and sanctity no man shall see the Lord - shall
never enjoy his presence in the world of blessedness. To see God, in the
Hebrew phrase, is to enjoy him; and without holiness of heart and life
this is impossible. No soul can be fit for heaven that has not suitable
dispositions for the place.

[Hebrews 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">heb 12:15</span></span>

Looking diligently - Επισκοπουντες· Looking about, over, and upon; being
constantly on your guard.

Lest any man fail of the grace of God - Μη τις ὑστερων απο της χαριτος
του Θεου· Lest any person should come behind, or fall off from, this
grace or Gift of God; this state of salvation, viz. the Gospel system or
Christianity; for this is most evidently the meaning of the apostle. It
is not the falling from a work of grace in their own souls, but from the
Gospel, to apostatize from which they had now many temptations; and to
guard them against this, the whole epistle was written.

Lest any root of bitterness springing up - A root of bitterness
signifies a poisonous plant. The Hebrews call every species of poison a
bitter, and with considerable propriety, as most plants are poisonous in
proportion to the quantum of the bitter principle they possess. The root
of bitterness is here used metaphorically for a bad man, or a man
holding unsound doctrines, and endeavoring to spread them in the Church.

Trouble you - This alludes to the effects of poison taken into the body:
the whole animal system is disturbed, sometimes violent retchings, great
disturbances through the whole alimentary canal, together with the most
fatal changes in the whole sanguineous system, are the consequences of
poison taken into the stomach. The blood itself (the principle, under
God, of life) becomes putrescent; and probably to this the intelligent
apostle alludes when he says, and thereby many be defiled, μιανθωσι,
corrupted or contaminated.

Bad example and false teaching have corrupted thousands, and are still
making desolation in the world and in the Church.

[Hebrews 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">heb 12:16</span></span>

Lest there be any fornicator - Any licentious person who would turn the
Gospel of the grace of God into lasciviousness.

Or profane person, as Esau - It is not intimated that Esau was a
fornicator; and the disjunctive η, or, separates the profane person from
the fornicator. And Esau is here termed profane, because he so far
disregarded the spiritual advantages connected with his rights of
primogeniture, that he alienated the whole for a single mess of pottage.
See the note on [Gen 25:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#034.md). The word
βεβηλος, which we translate profane, is compounded of βε, which in
composition has a negative signification, and βηλος, the threshold of a
temple or sacred edifice; and was applied to those who were not
initiated into the sacred mysteries, or who were despisers of sacred
things, and consequently were to be denied admittance to the temple, and
were not permitted to assist at holy rites. Indeed, among the Greeks
βεβηλος signified any thing or person which was not consecrated to the
gods. Hence, in the opening of their worship, they were accustomed to
proclaim,

Procul, O procul, este profani!

Virg.

"Hence! O hence! ye profane."

And,

Odi profanum vulgus, et arceo.

Hor.

"I abominate the profane vulgar, and drive them from the temple."

The Latin profanus, from which we have our word, is compounded of procul
a fano, "far from the temple," properly an irreligious man.

Sold his birthright - The first-born, in patriarchal times,

1\. Had a right to the priesthood, [Exo
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#029.md).

2\. And a double portion of all the father's possessions, [Deu
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#017.md).

3\. And was lord over his brethren, [Gen
27:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#029.md), [Gen
27:37](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#037.md); [Gen
49:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#003.md).

4\. And in the family of Abraham the first-born was the very source
whence the Messiah as the Redeemer of the world, and the Church of God,
were to spring. Farther,

5\. The first-born had the right of conveying especial blessings and
privileges when he came to die. See the case of Isaac and his two sons,
Jacob and Esau, in the history to which the apostle alludes, Genesis 27;
and that of Jacob and his twelve sons, Genesis 49;

In short, the rights of primogeniture were among the most noble,
honorable, and spiritual in the ancient world.

[Hebrews 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">heb 12:17</span></span>

When he would have inherited the blessing - When he wished to have the
lordship over the whole family conveyed to him, and sought it earnestly
with tears, he found no place for a change in his father's mind and
counsel, who now perceived that it was the will of God that Jacob should
be made lord of all.

Repentance - Here μετανοια is not to be taken in a theological sense, as
implying contrition for sin, but merely change of mind or purpose; nor
does the word refer here to Esau at all, but to his father, whom Esau
could not, with all his tears and entreaties, persuade to reverse what
he had done. I have blessed him, said he, yea, and he must be blessed; I
cannot reverse it now. See the whole of this transaction largely
considered and explained, See the notes on [Gen
25:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#029.md), etc., and see [Gen
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#001) (note.md), etc. Nothing spoken here
by the apostle, nor in the history in Genesis to which he refers,
concerns the eternal state of either of the two brothers. The use made
of the transaction by the apostle is of great importance: Take heed
lest, by apostatizing from the Gospel, ye forfeit all right and title to
the heavenly birthright, and never again be able to retrieve it; because
they who reject the Gospel reject the only means of salvation.

[Hebrews 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">heb 12:18</span></span>

For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched - I believe the
words ψηλαφωμενῳ ορει should be translated to a palpable or material
mountain; for that it was not a mountain that on this occasion might be
touched, the history, [Exo 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#012.md), [Exo
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#013.md), shows; and the apostle himself,
in [Heb 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#020.md), confirms. It is called
here a palpable or material mount, to distinguish it from that spiritual
mount Sion, of which the apostle is speaking. Some contend that it
should be translated tacto de caelo, thunder-struck; this sense would
agree well enough with the scope of the place. The apostle's design is
to show that the dispensation of the law engendered terror; that it was
most awful and exclusive; that it belonged only to the Jewish people;
and that, even to them, it was so terrible that they could not endure
that which was commanded, and entreated that God would not communicate
with them in his own person, but by the ministry of Moses: and even to
Moses, who held the highest intimacy with Jehovah, the revealed glories,
the burning fire, the blackness, the darkness, the tempest, the
loud-sounding trumpet, and the voice of words, were so terrible that he
said, I exceedingly fear and tremble.

These were the things which were exhibited on that material mountain;
but the Gospel dispensation is one grand, copious, and interesting
display of the infinite love of God. It is all encouragement; breathes
nothing but mercy; is not an exclusive system; embraces the whole human
race; has Jesus, the sinner's friend, for its mediator; is ratified by
his blood; and is suited, most gloriously suited, to all the wants and
wishes of every soul of man.

[Hebrews 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">heb 12:22</span></span>

But ye are come unto mount Sion - In order to enter fully into the
apostle's meaning, we must observe,

1\. That the Church, which is called here the city of the living God,
the heavenly Jerusalem, and mount Sion, is represented under the notion
of a City.

2\. That the great assembly of believers in Christ is here opposed to
the congregation of the Israelites assembled at Mount Sinai.

3\. That the innumerable company of angels is here opposed to, those
angels by whom the law was ushered in, [Act
7:53](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#053.md); [Gal
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019.md).

4\. That the Gospel first-born, whose names are written in heaven, are
here opposed to the enrolled first-born among the Israelites, [Exo
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#005.md), [Exo
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#022.md).

5\. That the mediator of the new covenant, the Lord Jesus, is here
opposed to Moses, the mediator of the old.

6\. And that the blood of sprinkling, of Christ, our High Priest, refers
to the act of Moses, [Exo 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#008.md) : "And
Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold
the blood of the covenant, which the Lord hath made with you concerning
all these words."

1\. The description in these verses does not refer to a heavenly state;
for the terrible nature of the Mosaic dispensation is never opposed to
heaven or life eternal, but to the economy of the New Testament.

2\. In heaven there is no need of a mediator, or sprinkling of blood;
but these are mentioned in the state which the apostle describes.

The heavenly Jerusalem - This phrase means the Church of the New
Testament, as Schoettgen has amply proved in his dissertation on this
subject.

To an innumerable company of angels - Μυριασιν αγγελων· To myriads, tens
of thousands, of angels. These are represented as the attendants upon
God, when he manifests himself in any external manner to mankind. When
he gave the law at Mount Sinai, it is intimated that myriads of these
holy beings attended him. "The chariots of the Lord are twenty thousand,
even thousands of angels; the Lord is among them as in Sinai, in the
holy place;" [Psa 68:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#017.md). And when he
shall come to judge the world, he will be attended with a similar
company. "Thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times
ten thousand stood before him;" [Dan
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#010.md). In both these cases, as in
several others, these seem to be, speaking after the manner of men, the
body guard of the Almighty. Though angels make a part of the inhabitants
of the New Jerusalem, yet they belong also to the Church below. Christ
has in some sort incorporated them with his followers, for "they are all
ministering spirits, sent forth to minister to them that shall be heirs
of salvation," and they are all ever considered as making a part of
God's subjects.

[Hebrews 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">heb 12:23</span></span>

To the general assembly - Πανηγυρει. This word is joined to the
preceding by some of the best MSS., and is quoted in connection by
several of the fathers: Ye are come - to the general assembly of
innumerable angels; and this is probably the true connection.

The word πανηγυρις is compounded of παν, all, and αγυρις, an assembly;
and means, particularly, an assembly collected on festive occasions. It
is applied to the assembly of the Grecian states at their national
games, Olympic, Isthmian, etc.; and hence a speech pronounced in favor
of any person at such festive assemblies was called πανηγυρικος λογος, a
panegyrical discourse; and hence our word panegyric.

The first-born - Those who first received the Gospel of Christ, and who
are elsewhere termed the first fruits: this is spoken in allusion to the
first-born among the Israelites, who were all considered as the Lord's
property, and were dedicated to him. The Jews gave the title בכור
bechor, first-born, to those who were very eminent or excellent; what we
would term the head or top of his kin. The Church of the first-born is
the assembly of the most excellent.

Which are written in heaven - Who are enrolled as citizens of the New
Jerusalem, and are entitled to all the rights, privileges, and
immunities of the Church here, and of heaven above. This is spoken in
allusion to the custom of enrolling or writing on tables, etc., the
names of all the citizens of a particular city; and all those thus
registered were considered as having a right to live there, and to enjoy
all its privileges. All genuine believers are denizens of heaven. That
is their country, and there they have their rights, etc. And every
member of Christ has a right to, and can demand, every ordinance in the
Church of his Redeemer; and wo to him who attempts to prevent them!

God the Judge of all - The supreme God is ever present in this general
assembly: to him they are all gathered; by him they are admitted to all
those rights, etc.; under his inspection they continue to act; and it is
he alone who erases from the register those who act unworthily of their
citizenship. Judge here is to be taken in the Jewish use of the term,
i.e. one who exercises sovereign rule and authority.

The spirits of just men made perfect - We cannot understand these terms
without the assistance of Jewish phraseology. The Jews divide mankind
into three classes: -

1\. The Just Perfect, צדיקים גמורים tsaddikim gemurim.

2\. The wicked perfect, רשעים גמורים reshaim gemurim.

3\. Those between both, בינוניים beinoniyim.

1\. The just perfect are those,

1\. Who have conquered all brutal appetites and gross passions.

2\. Who have stood in the time of strong temptation.

3\. Who give alms with a sincere heart.

4\. Who worship the true God only.

5\. Who are not invidious.

6\. Those from whom God has taken יצר הרע yetser hara, evil
concupiscence, and given יצר טוב yetser tob, the good principle.

2\. The wicked perfect are those,

1\. Who never repent.

2\. They receive their portion in this life, because they can have none
in the life to come, and are under the influence of יצר הרע yetser hara,
the evil principle.

3\. The intermediate are those who are influenced partly by the evil
principle, and partly by the good. - See Schoettgen.

In several parts of this epistle τελειος, the just man, signifies one
who has a full knowledge of the Christian system, who is justified and
saved by Christ Jesus; and the τετελειωνεμοι are the adult Christians,
who are opposed to the νηπιοι or babes in knowledge and grace. See [Heb
5:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#012.md); [Heb
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#011.md); and [Gal
4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001.md). The spirits of the just men
made perfect, or the righteous perfect, are the full grown Christians;
those who are justified by the blood and sanctified by the Spirit of
Christ. Being come to such, implies that spiritual union which the
disciples of Christ have with each other, and which they possess how far
soever separate; for they are all joined in one spirit, [Eph
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#018.md); they are in the unity of the
spirit, [Eph 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#003.md), [Eph
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#004.md); and of one soul, [Act
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#032.md). This is a unity which was never
possessed even by the Jews themselves in their best state; it is
peculiar to real Christianity: as to nominal Christianity, wars and
desolations between man and his fellows are quite consistent with its
spirit. See at the end of the chapter, (note).

[Hebrews 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">heb 12:24</span></span>

And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant - The old covenant and its
mediator, Moses, are passed away. See [Heb
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#013.md). The new covenant, i.e. the
Gospel, is now in force, and will be to the end of the world; and Jesus,
the Son of God, the brightness of the Father's glory, the Maker and
Preserver of all things, the Savior and the Judge of all men, is its
mediator. Both the covenant and its mediator are infinitely superior to
those of the Jews, and they are very properly set down here among the
superior benefits and glories of Christianity.

To the blood of sprinkling - This is an allusion, as was before
observed, to the sprinkling of the blood of the covenant sacrifice upon
the people, when that covenant was made upon Mount Sinai; to the
sprinkling of the blood of the sin-offerings before the mercy-seat; and
probably to the sprinkling of the blood of the paschal lamb on their
houses, to prevent their destruction by the destroying angel. But all
these sprinklings were partial and inefficacious, and had no meaning but
as they referred to this: the blood of sprinkling under the new covenant
is ever ready; all may have it applied; it continues through ages; and
is the highest glory of Christianity, because by it we draw nigh to God,
and through it get our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience; and, in
a word, have an entrance unto the holiest by the blood of Jesus.

Better things than that of Abel - God accepted Abel's sacrifice, and,
was well pleased with it; for Abel was a righteous man, and offered his
sacrifice by faith in the great promise. But the blood of Christ's
sacrifice was infinitely more precious than the blood of Abel's
sacrifice, as Jesus is infinitely greater than Abel; and the blood of
Christ avails for the sins of the whole world, whereas the blood of
Abel's sacrifice could avail only for himself.

Many have supposed that the blood of Abel means here the blood that was
shed by Cain in the murder of this holy man, and that the blood of Jesus
speaks better things than it does, because the blood of Abel called for
vengeance, but the blood of Christ for pardon; this interpretation
reflects little credit on the understanding of the apostle. To say that
the blood of Christ spoke better things than that of Abel is saying
little indeed; it might speak very little good to any soul of man, and
yet speak better things than that blood of Abel which spoke no kind of
good to any human creature, and only called for vengeance against him
that shed it. The truth is, the sacrifice offered by Abel is that which
is intended; that, as we have already seen, was pleasing in the sight of
God, and was accepted in behalf of him who offered it: but the blood of
Christ is infinitely more acceptable with God; it was shed for the whole
human race, and cleanses all who believe from all unrighteousness.

[Hebrews 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">heb 12:25</span></span>

See - Βλεπετε· Take heed, that ye refuse not him - the Lord Jesus, the
mediator of the new covenant, who now speaketh from heaven, by his
Gospel, to the Jews and to the Gentiles, having in his incarnation come
down from God.

Him that spake on earth - Moses, who spoke on the part of God to the
Hebrews, every transgression of whose word received a just recompense of
reward, none being permitted to escape punishment; consequently, if ye
turn away from Christ, who speaks to you from heaven, you may expect a
much sorer punishment, the offense against God being so much the more
heinous, as the privileges slighted are more important and glorious.

[Hebrews 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">heb 12:26</span></span>

Whose voice then shook the earth - Namely, at the giving of the law on
Mount Sinai; and from this it seems that it was the voice of Jesus that
then shook the earth, and that it was he who came down on the mount. But
others refer this simply to God the Father giving the law.

Not the earth only, but also heaven - Probably referring to the
approaching destruction of Jerusalem, and the total abolition of the
political and ecclesiastical constitution of the Jews; the one being
signified by the earth, the other by heaven; for the Jewish state and
worship are frequently thus termed in the prophetic writings. And this
seems to be the apostle's meaning, as he evidently refers to [Hag
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#006.md), where this event is predicted. It
may also remotely refer to the final dissolution of all things.

[Hebrews 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">heb 12:27</span></span>

The removing of those things that are shaken - The whole of the Jewish
polity, which had been in a shaken state from the time that Judea had
fallen under the power of the Romans.

As of things that are made - That is, subjects intended to last only for
a time. God never designed that the Jewish religion should become
general, nor be permanent.

Those things which cannot be shaken - The whole Gospel system, which
cannot be moved by the power of man.

May remain - Be permanent; God designing that this shall be the last
dispensation of his grace and mercy, and that it shall continue till the
earth and the heavens are no more.

[Hebrews 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">heb 12:28</span></span>

We receiving a kingdom - The Gospel dispensation, frequently termed the
kingdom of God and the kingdom of heaven, because in it God reigns among
men, and he reigns in the hearts of them that believe, and his kingdom
is righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.

Which cannot be moved - Which never can fail, because it is the last
dispensation.

Let us have grace - Εχωμεν χαριν· Let us have, keep, or hold fast, the
benefit or gift, that is, the heavenly kingdom which God has given us.
This is the meaning of the word, [Co2
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#004.md), and is so rendered by our
translators; and it is only by this heavenly gift of the Gospel that we
can serve God acceptably, for he can be pleased with no service that is
not performed according to the Gospel of his Son.

If we prefer the common meaning of the word grace it comes to the same
thing; without the grace - the especial succor and influence of Christ,
we cannot serve, λατρευωμεν, pay religious worship to God; for he
receives no burnt-offering that is not kindled by fire from his own
altar.

Acceptably - Ευαρεστως· In such a way as to please him well. And the
offering, with which he is well pleased, he will graciously accept; and
if he accept our service, his Spirit will testify in our conscience that
our ways please him. When Abel sacrifices, God is well pleased; where
Cain offers, there is no approbation.

Reverence - Αιδους· With shamefacedness or modesty.

Godly fear - Ευλαβειας· Religious fear. We have boldness to enter into
the holiest by the blood of Jesus, but let that boldness be ever
tempered with modesty and religious fear; for we should never forget
that we have sinned, and that God is a consuming fire. Instead of αιδους
και ευλαβειας, modesty and religious fear, ACD\*, several others, with
the Slavonic and Chrysostom, have ευλαβειας και δεους, and others have
φοβου και τρομου, fear and trembling; but the sense is nearly the same.

[Hebrews 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">heb 12:29</span></span>

For our God is a consuming fire - The apostle quotes [Deu
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#024.md), and by doing so he teaches us
this great truth, that sin under the Gospel is as abominable in God's
sight as it was under the law; and that the man who does not labor to
serve God with the principle and in the way already prescribed, will
find that fire to consume him which would otherwise have consumed his
sin.
