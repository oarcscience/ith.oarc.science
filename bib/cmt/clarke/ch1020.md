### [1 Chronicles Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 20:0</span></span>

Joab smites the city of Rabbah; and David puts the crown of its king
upon his own head, and treats the people of the city with great rigour,
[Ch1 20:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#001). First battle with the
Philistines, [Ch1 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#004). Second battle
with the Philistines, [Ch1 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#005). Third
battle with the Philistines, [Ch1
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#006), [Ch1
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#007). In these battles three giants
are slain, [Ch1 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#008).

[1 Chronicles 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 20:1</span></span>

After the year was expired, at the time that kings go out to battle -
About the spring of the year; see the note on [Sa2
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#001).

After this verse the parallel place in Samuel relates the whole story of
David and Bath-sheba, and the murder of Uriah, which the compiler of
these books passes over as he designedly does almost every thing
prejudicial to the character of David. All he states is, but David
tarried at Jerusalem; and, while he thus tarried, and Joab conducted the
war against the Ammonites, the awful transactions above referred to took
place.

[1 Chronicles 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 20:2</span></span>

David took the crown of their king - off his head - See [Sa2
12:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#030).

Precious stones in it - The Targum says, "And there was set in it a
precious stone, worth a talent of gold; this was that magnetic stone
that supported the woven gold in the air." What does he mean?

[1 Chronicles 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 20:3</span></span>

He brought out the people - See this transaction particularly explained
in the notes on the parallel places, [Sa2
12:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#030) (note).

[1 Chronicles 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 20:5</span></span>

Elhanan the son of Jair - See the note on [Sa2
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#019). The Targum says, "David, the
son of Jesse, a pious man, who rose at midnight to sing praises to God,
slew Lachmi, the brother of Goliath, the same day on which he slew
Goliath the Gittite, whose spear-staff was like a weaver's beam."

[1 Chronicles 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 20:6</span></span>

Fingers and toes were four and twenty - See the note on [Sa2
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#020).

[1 Chronicles 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 20:8</span></span>

These were born unto the giant in Gath - "These were born להרפא
leharapha, to that Rapha in Gath, or to Arapha." So the Vulgate,
Septuagint, and Chaldee.

The compiler of these books passes by also the incest of Amnon with his
sister Tamar, and the rebellion of Absalom, and the awful consequences
of all these. These should have preceded the fourth verse. These facts
could not be unknown to him, for they were notorious to all; but he saw
that they were already amply detailed in books which were accredited
among the people, and the relations were such as no friend to piety and
humanity could delight to repeat. On these grounds the reader will give
him credit for the omission. See on [Ch1
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#001) (note).
