### [Numbers Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 32:0</span></span>

The Reubenites and Gadites request Moses to give them their inheritance
on this side of Jordan, [Num 32:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#001.md).
Moses expostulates with and reproves them, [Num
32:6-15](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#006.md). They explain themselves, and
propose conditions, with which Moses is satisfied - they are to build
cities for their wives and children, and folds for their cattle, and go
ever Jordan armed with the other tribes, and fight against their enemies
till the land is subdued; after which they are to return, [Num
32:16-27](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#016.md). Moses proposes the business
to Eleazar, Joshua, and the elders, [Num
32:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#028.md). The Gadites and Reubenites
promise a faithful observance of the conditions, [Num
32:31](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#031.md), [Num
32:32](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#032.md); on which Moses assigns to them,
and the half tribe of Manasseh, the kingdom of Sihon, king of the
Amorites, and the kingdom of Og, king of Bashan, [Num
32:33](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#033.md). The cities built by the
Gadites, [Num 32:34-36](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#034.md). The cities
built by the Reubenites, [Num 32:37](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#037.md),
[Num 32:38](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#038.md). The children of Machir,
the son of Manasseh, expel the Amorites from Gilead, [Num
32:39](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#039.md), which Moses grants to them,
[Num 32:40](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#040.md). Jair, the son of Manasseh,
takes the small towns of Gilead, [Num
32:41](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#041.md). And Nobah takes Kenath and its
villages, [Num 32:42](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#042.md).

[Numbers 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 32:3</span></span>

Ataroth, and Dibon, etc. - The places mentioned here belonged to Sihon,
king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan, which being conquered by
the Israelites, constituted ever after a part of their territories, [Num
32:33](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#033.md).

[Numbers 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 32:5</span></span>

Let this land be given unto thy servants - Because it was good for
pasturage, and they had many flocks, [Num
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#001.md).

[Numbers 32:12](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 32:12</span></span>

Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite - It was Jephunneh that was the
Kenezite, and not Caleb. Kenaz was probably the father of Jephunneh.

[Numbers 32:16](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 32:16</span></span>

We will build - cities for our little ones - It was impossible for
these, numerous as they might be, to build cities and fortify them for
the defense of their families in their absence. Calmet supposes they
meant no more than repairing the cities of the Amorites which they had
lately taken; which work might have been very easily accomplished in the
time which they spent on this side of Jordan, before they went over with
their brethren, to put them in possession of the land.

[Numbers 32:17](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">num 32:17</span></span>

Because of the inhabitants of the land - These were the Ammonites,
Moabites, Idumeans, and the remains of the Midianites and Amorites. But
could the women and children even keep the defenced cities, when placed
in them? This certainly cannot be supposed possible. Many of the men of
war must of course stay behind. In the last census, Numbers 26, the
tribe of Reuben consisted of 43,730 men; the tribe of Gad, 40,500; the
tribe of Manasseh, 52,700; the half of which is 26,350. Add this to the
sum of the other two tribes, and the amount is 110,580. Now from [Jos
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#013.md) we learn that of the tribes of
Reuben and Gad, and the half of the tribe of Manasseh, only 40,000 armed
men passed over Jordan to assist their brethren in the reduction of the
land: consequently the number of 70,580 men were left behind for the
defense of the women, the children, and the flocks. This was more than
sufficient to defend them against a people already panic struck by their
late discomfitures and reverses.

[Numbers 32:34](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">num 32:34</span></span>

The children of Gad built - Aroer - This was situated on the river
Arnon, [Deu 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#036.md); [Kg2
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#033.md). It was formerly inhabited by
the Emim, a warlike and perhaps gigantic people. They were expelled by
the Moabites; the Moabites by the Amorites; and the Amorites by the
Israelites. The Gadites then possessed it till the captivity of their
tribe, with that of Reuben and the half of the tribe of Manasseh, by the
Assyrians, [Kg2 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029.md), after which the
Moabites appear to have repossessed it, as they seem to have occupied it
in the days of Jeremiah, [Jer
48:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#015.md).

[Numbers 32:38](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">num 32:38</span></span>

And Nebo - their names being changed - That is, Those who conquered the
cities called them after their own names. Thus the city Kenath, being
conquered by Nobah, was called after his name, [Num
32:42](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#042.md).

[Numbers 32:41](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">num 32:41</span></span>

Havoth-jair - That is, the villages or habitations of Jair; and thus
they should have been translated. As these two tribes and a half were
the first, says Ainsworth, who had their inheritance assigned to them in
the promised land, so they were the first of all Israel that were
carried captive out of their own land, because of their sins. "For they
transgressed against the God of their fathers, and went a whoring after
other gods. And God delivered them into the hands of Pul and
Tiglath-Pilneser, kings of Assyria, and they brought them to Halah,
Habor, Hara, and Gozan, unto this day." See [Ch1
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#025.md), [Ch1
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#026.md).
