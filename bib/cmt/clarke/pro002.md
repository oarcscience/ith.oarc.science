### [Proverbs Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">pro 2:0</span></span>

The teacher promises his pupil the highest advantages, if he will follow
the dictates of wisdom, [Pro 2:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#001.md). He
shall be happy in its enjoyment, [Pro
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#010.md), [Pro
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#011.md); shall be saved from wicked men,
[Pro 2:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#012.md); and from the snares of
bad women, [Pro 2:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#016.md); be a
companion of the good and upright; and be in safety in the land, when
the wicked shall be rooted out of it, [Pro
2:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#020.md).

[Proverbs 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 2:1</span></span>

My son - Here the tutor still continues to instruct his disciple.

Hide my commandments with theel Treasure them up in thy heart, and then
act from them through the medium of thy affections. He who has the rule
of his duty only in his Bible and in his head, is not likely to be a
steady, consistent character; his heart is not engaged, and his
obedience, in any case, can be only forced, or done from a sense of
duty: it is not the obedience of a loving, dutiful child, to an
affectionate father. But he who has the word of God in his heart, works
from his heart; his heart goes with him in all things, and he delights
to do the will of his heavenly Father, because his law is in his heart.
See [Pro 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#003.md).

[Proverbs 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 2:4</span></span>

If thou seekest her as silver - How do men seek money? What will they
not do to get rich? Reader, seek the salvation of thy soul as earnestly
as the covetous man seeks wealth; and be ashamed of thyself, if thou be
less in earnest after the true riches than he is after perishing wealth.

Hid treasures - The original word signifies property of any kind
concealed in the earth, in caves or such like; and may also mean
treasures, such as the precious metals or precious stones, which are
presumptively known to exist in such and such mines. And how are these
sought? Learn from the following circumstance: In the Brazils slaves are
employed to scrape up the soil from the bed of the Rio Janeiro, and wash
it carefully, in order to find particles of gold and diamonds; and it is
a law of the state, that he who finds a diamond of so many carats shall
have his freedom. This causes the greatest ardor and diligence in
searching, washing out the soil, picking, etc., in order to find such
diamonds, and the greatest anxiety for success; so precious is liberty
to the human heart. This method of searching for gold and precious
stones is alluded to in [Pro 3:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#013.md).
In this way Solomon wishes men to seek for wisdom, knowledge, and
understanding; and he who succeeds finds the liberty of the children of
God, and is saved from the slavery of sin and the empire of death.

[Proverbs 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 2:7</span></span>

He layeth up sound wisdom - תושיה tushiyah. We have met with this word
in Job; see [Job 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#012.md); [Job
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#013.md); [Job
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#006.md); [Job
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#016.md). See especially the note on [Job
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#006) (note.md), where the different
acceptations of the word are given.

Coverdale translates, "He preserveth the welfare of the righteous." It
is difficult to find, in any language, a term proper to express the
original meaning of the word; its seems to mean generally the essence or
substance of a thing, The thing itself - that which is chief of its
kind. He layeth up What Is Essential for the righteous.

[Proverbs 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 2:9</span></span>

Then shalt thou understand - He who is taught of God understands the
whole law of justice, mercy, righteousness, and truth; God has written
this on his heart. He who understands these things by books only is
never likely to practice or profit by them.

[Proverbs 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 2:11</span></span>

Discretion shall preserve thee - מזמה mezimmah. See on [Pro
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#004) (note.md). Here the word is taken in
a good sense, a good device. The man invents purposes of good; and all
his schemes, plans, and devices, have for their object God's glory and
the good of man: he deviseth liberal things, and by liberal things he
shall stand. Coverdale translates, "Then shall Counsel preserve thee." A
very good translation, much better than the present.

[Proverbs 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 2:12</span></span>

The man that speaketh froward things - תהפכות tahpuchoth, things of
subverston; from תפך taphach, to turn or change the course of a thing.
Men who wish to subvert the state of things, whether civil or religious;
who are seditious themselves, and wish to make others so. These speak
much of liberty and oppression, deal greatly in broad assertions, and
endeavor especially to corrupt the minds of youth.

[Proverbs 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 2:16</span></span>

The stranger which flattereth with her words - החליקה hechelikah, she
that smooths with her words. The original intimates the glib, oily
speeches of a prostitute. The English lick is supposed to be derived
from the original word.

[Proverbs 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 2:17</span></span>

Which forsaketh the guide of her youth - Leaves her father's house and
instructions, and abandons herself to the public.

The covenant of her God - Renounces the true religion, and mixes with
idolaters; for among them prostitution was enormous. Or by the covenant
may be meant the matrimonial contract, which is a covenant made in the
presence of God between the contracting parties, in which they bind
themselves to be faithful to each other.

[Proverbs 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 2:18</span></span>

For her house inclineth unto death - It is generally in by and secret
places that such women establish themselves. They go out of the high
road to get a residence; and every step that is taken towards their
house is a step towards death. The path of sin is the path of ruin: the
path of duty is the way of safety. For her paths incline unto the dead,
רפאים repheim, the inhabitants of the invisible world. The woman who
abandons herself to prostitution soon contracts, and generally
communicates, that disease, which, above all others, signs the speediest
and most effectual passport to the invisible world. Therefore it is
said,

[Proverbs 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 2:19</span></span>

None that go unto her return again - There are very few instances of
prostitutes ever returning to the paths of sobriety and truth; perhaps
not one of such as become prostitutes through a natural propensity to
debauchery. Among those who have been deceived, debauched, and
abandoned, many have been reclaimed; and to such alone penitentiaries
may be useful; to the others they may only be incentives to farther
sinning. Rakes and debauchees are sometimes converted: but most of them
never lay hold on the path of life; they have had their health
destroyed, and never recover it. The original, חיים chaiyim, means
lives; not only the health of the body is destroyed, but the soul is
ruined. Thus the unhappy man may be said to be doubly slain.

[Proverbs 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 2:20</span></span>

That thou mayest mark - Therefore thou shalt walk.

[Proverbs 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 2:22</span></span>

Transgressors - בוגדים bogedim. The garment men, the hypocrites; those
who act borrowed characters, who go under a eloak; dissemblers. All such
shall be rooted out of the land; they shall not be blessed with
posterity. In general it is so: and were it not so, one evil offspring
succeeding another, adding their own to their predecessors' vices, the
earth would become so exceedingly corrupt that a second flood, or a
fire, would be necessary to purge it.
