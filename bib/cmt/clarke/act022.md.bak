### [Acts Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#001.md)

[Acts](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">act 22:0</span></span>

Paul, in his address to the people, gives an account of his birth and
education, [Act 21:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#001.md). His prejudices
against Christianity, [Act 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#004.md), [Act
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#005.md). And of his miraculous
conversion, and call to the apostleship, vv. 6-21. The Jews, hearing him
say that God had sent him to preach the Gospel to the Gentiles, become
exceedingly outrageous, and clamor for his life, [Act
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#022.md), [Act
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#023.md). The chief captain orders him to
be examined by scourging; but he, pleading his privilege as a Roman
citizen, escapes the torture, [Act
21:24-29](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#024.md). The next day the chief
captain brings Paul before the chief priests and their council, [Act
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#030.md).

[Acts 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 22:1</span></span>

Men, brethren, and fathers - A Hebrew form of expression for brethren
and fathers: for two classes only are addressed. See the note on [Act
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#002.md).

Hear ye my defense - Μου της απολογιας, This apology of mine; in this
sense the word apology was anciently understood: hence the Apologies of
the primitive fathers, i.e. their defenses of the Christian religion.
And this is as proper literal meaning; but it is now used only as
implying an excuse for improper conduct. That this is an abuse of the
term requires no proof.

[Acts 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 22:2</span></span>

When they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue - He had probably
been traduced by the Jews of Asia as a mere Gentile, distinguished only
by his virulence against the Jewish religion; which virulence proceeded
from his malice and ignorance.

[Acts 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 22:3</span></span>

I am verily a man which am a Jew - A periphrasis for, I am really a Jew:
and his mentioning this adds weight to the conjecture in the preceding
note. He shows that he could not be ignorant of the Jewish religion, as
he had had the best instructer in it which Jerusalem could produce.

Yet brought up, etc. - Bp. Pearce proposes that this verse should be
thus read and translated: but brought up in this city; instructed at the
feet of Gamaliel, according to the most exact manner, being exceedingly
zealous for the law of our fathers, as ye all are this day.

Born in Tarsus - See the notes on [Act
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#011.md); [Act
21:39](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#039.md).

Feet of Gamaliel - See a full account of this man in the note on [Act
5:34](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#034) (note.md).

It has been generally supposed that the phrase, brought up at the feet,
is a reference to the Jewish custom, viz. that the disciples of the
rabbins sat on low seats, or on the ground, whilst the rabbin himself
occupied a lofty chair. But we rather learn, from Jewish authority, that
the disciples of the rabbins stood before their teachers, as Vitringa
has proved in his treatise De Synag. Vet. lib. i. p. 1, cap. 7. Kypke,
therefore, contends that παρα τους ποδας, at the feet, means the same as
πλησιον, near, or before, which is not an unfrequent mode of speech
among both sacred and profane writers. Thus, in [Act
4:35](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#035.md), [Act
4:37](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#037.md); [Act
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#002.md), ετιθουν παρα τους ποδας των
αποϚολων, they laid it at the apostles' feet, means only, they brought
it to the apostles. So in 2 Maccabees 4:7, παρα ποδας ηδη τον ᾁδην
ὁρωντες κειμενον, they saw death already lying at their feet; that is,
as the Syriac translator has properly rendered it, they saw death
immediately before them. So Themistius, Or. 27, p. 341, who adds the
term by which the phrase is explained, εϚι και πλησιον αει τῳ δυναμενω
λαμβανειν, ante pedes id temper et prope est, illi qui accipere potest.
Also Lucian, De Conser. Hist. p. 669, ὡν παρα ποδας οἱ ελεγχοι. The
refutation of which is at hand. The same kind of form occurs in the
Hebrew, [Exo 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#008.md) : All the people
that are at thy feet, ברגליך beragleica, i.e. who are with thee, under
thy command, [Sa2 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#016.md). And the king
went out, and all his household, ברגליו beraglaiv, at his feet; that is,
with him, in his company. See Kypke. The phrase is used in the same
sense among the Hindoos: I learned this at my father's feet - instead
of, I learned it of my father. I was taught at the feet of such a
teacher - my teacher's feet say so; meaning, simply, such and such
persons taught me.

According to the perfect manner - That is, according to that strict
interpretation of the law, and especially the traditions of the elders,
for which the Pharisees were remarkable. That it is Pharisaism that the
apostle has in view, when he says he was taught according to, ακριβειαν,
the most extinct manner, is evident; and hence, in [Act
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#005.md), he calls Pharisaism ακριβεϚατην,
the most exact system; and, under it, he was zealous towards God;
scrupulously exact in every part of his duty, accompanying this with
reverence to the supreme Being, and deep concern for his honor and
glory.

[Acts 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 22:4</span></span>

I persecuted this way - Ταυτην την ὁδον; This doctrine, the way of
worshipping God, and arriving at a state of blessedness. See on [Act
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#002) (note.md).

Binding and delivering into prisons - See on [Act
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#003) (note.md); [Act
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#002) (note.md).

[Acts 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 22:5</span></span>

The high priest doth bear me witness, etc. - He probably referred to the
letters of authority which he had received from the high priest, and the
whole estate of the elders, παν το πρεσβυτεριον, the whole of the
presbytery, that is, the sanhedrin; and it is likely, that he had those
letters to produce. This zeal of his against Christianity was an ample
proof of his sincerity as a Pharisaical Jew.

[Acts 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 22:6</span></span>

As I made my journey, etc. - See the whole of this account, and all the
particular circumstances, considered at large in the notes on [Act
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#001) (note.md), etc., and the observations
at the conclusion of that chapter.

[Acts 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 22:14</span></span>

And see that Just One - The Lord Jesus, called the Just One, in
opposition to the Jews, who crucified him as a malefactor: see the note
on [Act 7:52](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#052.md). This is an additional
proof that Jesus Christ did actually appear unto Saul of Tarsus.

[Acts 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 22:15</span></span>

Thou shalt be his witness unto all - Thou shalt proclaim Christ
crucified, both to Jews and Gentiles.

[Acts 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 22:16</span></span>

Arise, and be baptized - Take now the profession of Christ's faith most
solemnly upon thee, by being baptized in the name of Father, Son, and
Holy Spirit.

Wash away thy sins, etc. - Let this washing of thy body represent to
thee the washing away of thy sins: and know that this washing away of
sin can be received only by invoking the name of the Lord.

[Acts 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 22:17</span></span>

When I was come again to Jerusalem - It is likely that he refers to the
first journey to Jerusalem, about three years after his conversion, [Act
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#025.md), [Act
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#026.md), and [Gal
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#018.md).

I was in a trance - This circumstance is not mentioned any where else,
unless it be that to which himself refers in [Co2
12:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#002.md), when he conceived himself
transported to the third heaven; and, if the case be the same, the
appearance of Jesus Christ to him, and the command given, are
circumstances related only in this place.

[Acts 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 22:19</span></span>

I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue - This shows what an active
instrument Saul of Tarsus was, in the hands of this persecuting
priesthood, and how very generally the followers of Christ were
persecuted, and how difficult it was at this time to profess
Christianity.

[Acts 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 22:20</span></span>

When the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed - See on [Act
7:58](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#058) (note.md); [Act
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#001) (note.md). All these things Paul
alleged as reasons why he could not expect to be received by the
Christians; for how could they suppose that such a persecutor could be
converted?

[Acts 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 22:21</span></span>

I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles - This was the particular
appointment of St. Paul: he was the apostle of the Gentiles; for, though
he preached frequently to the Jews, yet to preach the Gospel to the
Gentiles, and to write for the conversion and establishment of the
Gentile world, were his peculiar destination. Hence we find him and his
companions travelling every where; through Judea, Phoenicia, Arabia,
Syria, Cilicia, Pisidia, Lycaonia, Pamphylia, Galatia, Phrygia,
Macedonia, Greece, Asia, the Isles of the Mediterranean Sea, the Isles
of the Aegean Sea, Italy, and some add Spain and even Britain. This was
the diocess of this primitive bishop: none of the apostles traveled,
none preached, none labored as this man; and, we may add, none was so
greatly owned of God. The epistles of Peter, John, James, and Jude, are
great and excellent; but, when compared with those of Paul, however
glorious they may be, they have no glory comparatively, by reason of
that glory which excelleth. Next to Jesus Christ, St. Paul is the glory
of the Christian Church. Jesus is the foundation; Paul, the
master-builder.

[Acts 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 22:22</span></span>

They gave him audience unto this word - Namely, that God had sent him to
the Gentiles: not that they refused to preach the law to the Gentiles,
and make them proselytes; for this they were fond of doing, so that our
Lord says, they compassed sea and land to make a proselyte; but they
understood the apostle as stating that God had rejected them, and called
the Gentiles to be his peculiar people in their place; and this they
could not bear.

Away with such a fellow - According to the law of Moses, he who
attempted to seduce the people to any strange worship was to be stoned,
[Deu 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#015.md). The Jews wished to
insinuate that the apostle was guilty of this crime, and that therefore
he should be stoned, or put to death.

[Acts 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 22:23</span></span>

Cast off their clothes - Bishop Pearce supposes that shaking their upper
garments is all that is meant here; and that it was an ancient custom
for men to do so when highly pleased or greatly irritated; but it is
likely that some of them were now actually throwing off their clothes,
in order to prepare to stone Paul.

Threw dust into the air - In sign of contempt, and by way of execration.
Shimei acted so, in order to express his contempt of David, [Sa2
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#013.md), where it is said, he cursed him
as he went, and threw stones at him; or, as the margin, he dusted him
with dust. Their throwing dust in the air was also expressive of
extraordinary rage and vindictive malice. The apostle, being guarded by
the Roman soldiers, was out of the power of the mob; and their throwing
dust in the air not only showed their rage, but also their vexation that
they could not get the apostle into their power. It is still used as a
token of hostility and defiance. M. Denon, (Travels in Egypt, vol. iii.
p. 98), on coming down the Nile to Cairo, stopped at the ancient city of
Antinoe, to examine its ruins. "Being desirous of obtaining a view of
the whole of these ruins, we ascended a little hill, and soon perceived
the inhabitants of the modern village assembling behind an opposite
eminence: scarcely had we come over against them than, supposing our
intentions to be hostile, they called out for assistance, and threw dust
into the air, in token of defiance. The alarm spread, and they began
firing upon us."

[Acts 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 22:24</span></span>

Examined by scourging - As the chief captain did not understand the
Hebrew language, he was ignorant of the charge brought against Paul, and
ignorant also of the defense which the apostle had made; and, as he saw
that they grew more and more outrageous, he supposed that Paul must have
given them the highest provocation; and therefore he determined to put
him to the torture, in order to find out the nature of his crime. The
practice of putting people to the rack, in order to make them confess,
has, to the disgrace of human nature, existed in all countries.

[Acts 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 22:25</span></span>

And as they bound him, etc. - They were going to tie him to a post, that
they might scourge him.

Is it lawful, etc. - The Roman law absolutely forbade the binding of a
Roman citizen. See the note on [Act
16:37](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#037.md).

[Acts 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 22:28</span></span>

With a great sum obtained I this freedom - So it appears that the
freedom, even of Rome, might be purchased, and that it was sold at a
very high price.

But I was free born - It has been generally believed that the
inhabitants of Tarsus, born in that city, had the same rights and
privileges as Roman citizens, in consequence of a charter or grant from
Julius Caesar. Calmet disputes this, because Tarsus was a free not a
colonial city; and he supposes that Paul's father might have been
rewarded with the freedom of Rome for some military services, and that
it was in consequence of this that Paul was horn free. But that the city
of Tarsus had such privileges appears extremely probable. In [Act
21:39](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#039.md), Paul says he was born at Tarsus
in Cilicia, and in [Act 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#028.md), he says
he was free born; and, at [Act 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#026.md),
he calls himself a Roman; as he does also [Act
16:37](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#037.md). From whence it has been
concluded, with every show of reason, that Tarsus, though no Roman
colony, yet had this privilege granted to it, that its natives should be
citizens of Rome. Pliny, in Hist. Nat. lib. [Act
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#027.md), tells us that Tarsus was a free
city. And Appian, De Bello Civil. lib. v. p. 1077, edit. Tollii, says
that Antony, Ταρσεας ελευθερους ηφιει, και ατελεις φορων, made the
people of Tarsus free, and discharged them from paying tribute. Dio
Cassius, lib. xlvii. p. 508, edit. Reimar, farther tells us, Adeo
Caesari priori, et ejus gratia etiam posteriori, favebant Tarsenses, ut
urbem suam pro Tarso Juliopolin vocaverint: "that, for the affection
which the people of Tarsus bore to Julius Caesar, and afterwards to
Augustus, the former caused their city to be called Juliopolis." The
Greek text is as follows: - οὑτω προσφιλως τῳ Καισαρι προτερῳ, και δι'
εκεινον τῳ δευτερῳ, οἱ Ταρσεις ειχον, ὡϚε και Ιουλιοπολιν σφας απ' αυτου
μετονομασαι. To which I add, that Philo, de Virt. vol. ii. p. 587, edit.
Mang., makes Agrippa say to Caligula, φιλων ενιων πατριδας ὁλας της
Ῥωμαΐκης ηξιωσας πολιτειας· You have made whole countries, to which your
friends belong, to be citizens of Rome. See the note on [Act
21:39](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#039.md). These testimonies are of weight
sufficient to show that Paul, by being born at Tarsus, might have been
free born, and a Roman. See Bishop Pearce on [Act
16:37](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#037.md).

[Acts 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 22:29</span></span>

After he knew that he was a Roman - He who was going to scourge him
durst not proceed to the torture when Paul declared himself to be a
Roman. A passage from Cicero, Orat. pro Verr. Act. ii. lib. v. 64,
throws the fullest light on this place: Ille, quisquis erat, quem tu in
crucem rapiebas, qui tibi esset ignotus, cum civem se Romanum esse
diceret, apud te Praetorem, si non effugium, ne moram quidem mortis
mentione atque usurpatione civitatis assequi potuit? "Whosoever he might
be whom thou wert hurrying to the rack, were he even unknown to thee, if
he said that he was a Roman citizen, he would necessarily obtain from
thee, the Praetor, by the simple mention of Rome, if not an escape, yet
at least a delay of his punishment." The whole of the sixty-fourth and
sixty-fifth sections of this oration, which speak so pointedly on this
subject, are worthy of consideration. Of this privilege he farther says,
Ib. in cap. lvii., Illa vox et exclamatio, Civis Romanus sum, quae saepe
multis in ultimis terris opem inter barbaros et salutem tulit, etc. That
exclamation, I am a Roman citizen, which often times has brought
assistance and safety, even among barbarians, in the remotest parts of
the earth, etc.

Plutarch likewise, in his Life of Pompey, (vol. iii. p. 445, edit.
Bryan), says, concerning the behavior of the pirates, when they had
taken any Roman prisoner, Εκεινο δε ην ὑβριϚικωτατον κ. τ. λ. what was
the most contumelious was this; when any of those whom they had made
captives cried out, Ῥωμαιος ειναι, That He Was a Roman, and told them
his name, they pretended to be surprised, and be in a fright, and smote
upon their thighs, and fell down (on their knees) to him, beseeching him
to pardon them! It is no wonder then that the torturer desisted, when
Paul cried out that he was a Roman; and that the chief captain was
alarmed, because he had bound him.

[Acts 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 22:30</span></span>

He - commanded - all their council to appear - Instead of ελθειν, to
come, which we translate, to appear, συνελθειν, to assemble, or meet
together, is the reading of ACE, nearly twenty others, the Ethiopic,
Arabic, Vulgate, Chrysostom, and Theophylact: this reading Griesbach has
received into the text; and it is most probably the true one: as the
chief captain wished to know the certainty of the matter, he desired the
Jewish council, or Sanhedrin, to assemble, and examine the business
thoroughly, that he might know of what the apostle was accused; as the
law would not permit him to proceed against a Roman in any judicial way,
but on the clearest evidence; and, as he understood that the cause of
their enmity was something that concerned their religion, he considered
the Sanhedrin to be the most proper judge, and therefore commanded them
to assemble; and there is no doubt that he himself, and a sufficient
number of soldiers, took care to attend, as the person of Paul could not
be safe in the hands of persons so prejudiced, unprincipled, and
enraged.

This chapter should end with the twenty-ninth verse, and the following
should begin with the thirtieth; this is the most natural division, and
is followed by some of the most correct editions of the original text.

1\. In his address to the council, Paul asserts that he is a Jew, born
of and among Jews; and that he had a regular Jewish education; and he
takes care to observe that he had early imbibed all the prejudices
peculiar to his countrymen, and had given the fullest proof of this in
his persecution of the Christians. Thus, his assertions, concerning the
unprofitableness of the legal ceremonies, could neither be attributed to
ignorance nor indifference. Had a Gentile, no matter how learned or
eminent, taught thus, his whole teaching would have been attributed to
ignorance, prejudice, and envy. God, therefore, in his endless mercy,
made use of a most eminent, learned, and bigoted Jew, to demonstrate the
nullity of the whole Jewish system, and show the necessity of the Gospel
of Jesus Christ.

2\. At the close of this chapter, Dr. Dodd has the following judicious
remark: - "As unrighteous as it was in the Roman officer, on this
popular clamor, to attempt putting this holy apostle to the torture, so
reasonable was St. Paul's plea, as a Roman citizen, to decline that
suffering. It is a prudence worthy the imitation of the bravest of men,
not to throw themselves into unnecessary difficulties. True courage
widely differs from rash and heedless temerity; nor are we under any
obligation, as Christians, to give up our civil privileges, which ought
to be esteemed as the gifts of God, to every insolent and turbulent
invader. In a thousand circumstances, gratitude to God, and duty to men,
will oblige us to insist upon them; and a generous concern for those who
may come after us should engage us to labor to transmit them to
posterity improved rather than impaired." This should be an article in
the creed of every genuine Briton.
