### [Psalms Chapter 145](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 145:0</span></span>

God is praised for his unsearchable greatness, [Psa
145:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#001.md), [Psa
145:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#002.md); for his majesty and terrible
acts, [Psa 145:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#003.md), [Psa
145:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#006.md); for his goodness and tender
mercies to all, [Psa 145:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#007.md); for his
power and kingdom, [Psa 145:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#010.md); for
his kindness to the distressed, [Psa
145:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#014.md); for his providence, [Psa
145:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#015.md). He hears and answers
prayer, [Psa 145:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#018.md). All should
praise him, [Psa 145:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#021.md).

This Psalm is attributed to David by the Hebrew and all the Versions. It
is the last of the acrostic Psalms; and should contain twenty-two
verses, as answering to the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet;
but the verse between the thirteenth and fourteenth, beginning with the
letter נ nun, is lost out of the present Hebrew copies; but a
translation of it is found in the Syriac, Septuagint, Vulgate, Ethiopic,
Arabic, and Anglo-Saxon. See below. It is an incomparable Psalm of
praise; and the rabbins have it in such high estimation, that they
assert, if a man with sincerity of heart repeat it three times a-day, he
shall infallibly enjoy the blessings of the world to come. It does not
appear on what particular occasion it was composed; or, indeed, whether
there was any occasion but gratitude to God for his ineffable favors to
mankind.

[Psalms 145:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 145:1</span></span>

I will extol thee - I will raise thee on high, I will lift thee up.

I will bless thy name - לעולם ועד leolam vaed, for ever and onward, in
this and the coming world. This sort of expressions, which are very
difficult to be translated, are on the whole well expressed by those
words, in a hymn of Mr. Addison: -

Through all eternity to theeA joyful song I'll raise

But O, eternity's too shortTo utter all thy praise!

This contains a strong hyperbole; but allowable in such cases.

[Psalms 145:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 145:3</span></span>

His greatness is unsearchable - Literally, To his mightinesses there is
no investigation. All in God is unlimited and eternal.

[Psalms 145:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 145:4</span></span>

One generation - Thy creating and redeeming acts are recorded in thy
word; but thy wondrous providential dealings with mankind must be handed
down by tradition, from generation to generation; for they are in
continual occurrence, and consequently innumerable.

[Psalms 145:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 145:8</span></span>

The Lord is gracious - His holy nature is ever disposed to show favor.

Full of compassion - Wherever he sees misery, his eye affects his heart.

Slow to anger - When there is even the greatest provocation.

Of great mercy - Great in his abundant mercy. These four things give us
a wonderful display of the goodness of the Divine nature.

[Psalms 145:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 145:9</span></span>

The Lord is good to all - There is not a soul out of hell that is not
continually under his most merciful regards; so far is he from willing
or decreeing before their creation the damnation of any man.

His tender mercies - His bowels of compassion are over all his works; he
feels for his intelligent offspring, as the most affectionate mother
does for the child of her own bosom. And through this matchless mercy,
these bowels of compassion, his son Jesus tasted death for every man.
How far is all that is here spoken of the nature of God opposed to the
Molochian doctrine of the eternal decree of reprobation!

"His grace for every soul is free:

For his, who forged the dire decree;

For every reprobate and me."

[Psalms 145:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 145:10</span></span>

All thy works shall praise thee - The God who is good to all.

Thy saints - חסידיך chasideycha, thy compassionate ones; those who are
partakers of thy great mercy, [Psa
145:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#008.md). These shall bless thee, because
they know, they feel, that thou willest the salvation of all. The dark,
the gloomy, the hard-hearted, the narrow-minded bigots, who never have
had thy love shed abroad in their hearts, can unfeelingly deal in the
damnation of their fellows.

[Psalms 145:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 145:12</span></span>

To make known - They delight to recommend their God and Father to
others.

[Psalms 145:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 145:13</span></span>

Thy dominion endureth - There is neither age nor people in and over
which God does not manifest his benignly ruling power. As the above
verse begins with the letter מ mem, the next in the order of the
alphabet shouid begin with נ nun: but that verse is totally wanting. To
say it never was in, is false, because the alphabet is not complete
without it; and it is an unanswerable argument to prove the careless
manner in which the Jews have preserved the Divine records. Though the
Syriac, Septuagint, Vulgate, Ethiopic, Arabic, and Anglo-Saxon, have a
verse, not in the Hebrew text, that answers to the נ nun, which is found
in no printed copy of the Hebrew Bible; yet one MS., now in Trinity
College, Dublin, has it thus, I suppose by correction, in the bottom of
the page: -

נאמן יהוה בכל דבריו וחסיד בכל מעשיו

Neeman Yehovah bechol debaraiv; vechasid bechol maasaiv.

"The Lord is faithful in all his words; and merciful in all his works."

Πιστος Κυριος εν τοις λογοις αυτου· και ὁσιος εν πασι τιος εργοις αυτου.
- Septuagint.

Fidelis Dominus in omnibus verbis suis: et sanctus in omnibus operibus
suis - Vulgate.

These two Versions, the Septuagint and Vulgate, are the same with the
Hebrew given above. The Anglo-Saxon is the same: -

"True Lord in all words his, and holy in all works his."

The Latin text in my old Psalter is the same with the present printed
Vulgate: "Fidelis Dominus in omnibus verbis suis, et sanctus in omnibus
operibus suis."

Thus translated in the same MSS.: Lorde true in all his words: and holy
in al his workes.

It is remarkable that the whole verse is wanting in the Vulgate, as
published in the Complutenstan Polyglot, as also the Antwerp and Paris
Polyglots, which were taken from it. It is wanting also in the Polyglot
Psalter of Porus, because he did not find it in the Hebrew text.

[Psalms 145:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 145:14</span></span>

The Lord upholdeth all that fall - נפלים nophelim, the falling, or those
who are not able to keep their feet; the weak. He shores them up; he is
their prop. No man falls through his own weakness merely; if he rely on
God, the strongest foe cannot shake him.

[Psalms 145:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 145:15</span></span>

The eyes of all wait upon thee - What a fine figure! The young of all
animals look up to their parents for food. God is here represented as
the universal Father, providing food for every living creature.

In due season - The kind of food that is suited to every animal, and to
all the stages of life in each animal. This is a wonderful mystery. It
is a fact that all are thus provided for; but how is it done? All expect
it from God, and not one is dsappointed! For,

[Psalms 145:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 145:16</span></span>

Thou openest thine hand - What a hand is this that holds in it all the
food that meets the desires and necessities of the universe of
creatures! A very large volume might be written upon this: The proper
kinds of food for the various classes of animals.

[Psalms 145:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 145:17</span></span>

The Lord is righteous - It was the similarity of this to the omitted
verse, which should have been the fourteenth, that caused it to be
omitted.

[Psalms 145:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 145:18</span></span>

The Lord is nigh - Whoever calls upon God in truth, with a sincere and
upright heart, one that truly desires his salvation, to that person God
is nigh. The following verse shows he is not only near to praying
people, but

1\. He will hear their cry.

2\. Fulfil their desires.

3\. Save them. Reader, lift up thy soul in prayer to this merciful God.

[Psalms 145:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 145:20</span></span>

The Lord preserveth - He is the keeper of all them that love him.

But all the wicked will he destroy - They call not upon him; they fight
against him, and he will confound and destroy them. There is something
curious in the שומר shomer, the keeper or guardian of the pious; he is
שמיד shamid, the destroyer of the wicked. The first word implies he is
continually keeping them; the second, that he causes the others to be
destroyed.

[Psalms 145:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 145:21</span></span>

Let all flesh bless his holy name - He is good to all, wants to save
all, actually feeds and preserves all. And as near as שמר shamar is to
שמד shamad, so near is he a Savior to those who stand on the brink of
destruction, if they will look to him.

For the application of all this Psalm to the Church of Christ, see the
analysis.
