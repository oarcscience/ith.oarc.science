[4 Kings (2 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg2 25:0</span></span>

Nebuchadnezzar besieges Jerusalem; it is taken, after having been sorely
reduced by famine, etc.; and Zedekiah, endeavoring to make his escape,
is made prisoner, his sons slain before his eyes; then, his eyes being
put out, he is put in chains and carried to Babylon, [Kg2
25:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#001.md). Nebuzar-adan burns the temple,
breaks down the walls of Jerusalem, and carries away the people
captives, leaving only a few to till the ground, [Kg2
25:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#008.md). He takes away all the brass,
and all the vessels of the temple, [Kg2
25:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#013.md). Several of the chief men and
nobles found in the city, he brings to Nebuchadnezzar at Riblah, who
puts them all to death, [Kg2 25:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#018.md).
Nebuchadnezzar makes Gedaliah governor over the poor people that were
left, against whom Ishmael rises, and slays him, and others with him; on
which the people in general, fearing the resentment of the Chaldeans,
flee to Egypt, [Kg2 25:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#022.md).
Evil-merodach, king of Babylon, releases Jehoiachin out of prison,
treats him kindly, and makes him his friend, [Kg2
25:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#027.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 25:5</span></span>

The army of the Chaldeans pursued - Zedekiah was taken, and brought
captive to Riblah in Syria, where Nebuchadnezzar then lay, who ordered
his sons to be slain before his face, and then put out his eyes; and
having loaded him with chains, sent him to Babylon, (see [Jer
39:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#004.md), [Jer
39:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#007.md); [Jer
52:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#007.md), [Jer
52:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#011).md), thus fulfilling the prophetic
declarations, that his eyes should see the eyes of the king of Babylon,
[Jer 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#004.md); [Jer
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#003.md); but Babylon he should not see,
though he was to die there; [Eze
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#013.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 25:8</span></span>

In the fifth month - On the seventh day of the fifth month, (answering
to Wednesday, Aug. 24), Nebuzar-adan made his entry into the city; and
having spent two days in making provision, on the tenth day of the same
month, (Saturday, Aug. 27), he set fire to the temple and the king's
palace, and the houses of the nobility, and burnt them to the ground;
[Jer 52:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#013.md), compared with [Jer
39:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#008.md). Thus the temple was destroyed in
the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the nineteenth of Nebuchadnezzar, the
first of the XLVIIIth Olympiad, in the one hundred and sixtieth current
year of the era of Nabonassar, four hundred and twenty-four years three
months and eight days from the time in which Solomon laid its foundation
stone.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 25:10</span></span>

Brake down the walls - In the same fifth month, [Jer
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#003.md), the walls of Jerusalem being
razed to the ground, all that were left in the city, and all that had
fled over formerly to Nebuchadnezzar, and all the common people of the
city, with all the king's treasures, those of the nobles, and the whole
furniture of the temple, did Nebuzar-adan carry off to Babylon. See [Jer
39:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#008.md), [Jer
39:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#009.md); [Jer
52:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#014.md), [Jer
52:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#023.md). And thus was Judah carried away
out of her own land, four hundred and sixty-eight years after David
began to reign over it; from the division of the ten tribes three
hundred and eighty-eight years; and from the destruction of the kingdom
of Israel, one hundred and thirty-four years; A.M. 3416, and before
Christ five hundred and ninety. And thus ends what is called the fifth
age of the world. See Usher's Annals.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 25:18</span></span>

Seraiah the chief priest - Zephaniah - The person who is here called the
second priest was what the Jews call sagan, a sort of deputy, who
performed the functions of the high priest when he was prevented by any
infirmity from attending the temple service. See on [Kg2
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#004) (note.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 25:19</span></span>

And five men of them that were in the king's presence - These were
principal counselors, and confidential officers.

In [Jer 52:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#025.md), it is said he took
seven men who were near the king's person, and the same number is found
in the Arabic in this place; and the Chaldee has no less than fifty men;
but in Jeremiah this, as well as all the rest of the versions, reads
seven. Probably they were no more than five at first, or, perhaps
Jeremiah reckoned with the five the officer that was set over the men of
war, and the principal scribe of the host mentioned here, as two with
the five; and thus made seven in the whole.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 25:21</span></span>

The king of Babylon smote them - He had, no doubt, found that these had
counselled Zedekiah to revolt.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg2 25:22</span></span>

Made Gedaliah - ruler - This was no regal dignity; he was only a sort of
hind or overseer, appointed to regulate the husbandmen.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 25:23</span></span>

To Mizpah - This is said to have been situated on the east side of the
river Jordan, and most contiguous to Babylon, and therefore the most
proper for the residence of Gedaliah, because nearest to the place from
which he was to receive his instructions. But there were several places
of this name, and we do not exactly know where this was situated.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg2 25:24</span></span>

Gedaliah sware to them - He pledged himself in the most solemn manner to
encourage and protect them.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 25:25</span></span>

Smote Gedaliah - This was at an entertainment which Gedaliah had made
for them; see [Jer 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#001.md), etc. He was
not content with this murder, but slew fourscore more, who were coming
with offerings to the temple, and took several as prisoners, among whom
were some of the king's daughters; and set off to go to the Ammonites:
but Johanan, the son of Careah, hearing of these outrages, raised a
number of men, and pursued Ishmael upon which Ishmael's prisoners
immediately turned and joined Johanan; so that he, and eight of his
accomplices, with difficulty escaped to the Ammonites. See [Jer
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#001.md), etc. Baalis, king of the
Ammonites, had sent Ishmael to murder Gedaliah; and of this he was
informed by Johanan, who offered to prevent it, by taking away the life
of this murderer. But Gedaliah could not believe that he harbored such
foul designs, and therefore took no precaution to save his life. See
[Jer 40:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#013.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 25:27</span></span>

And it came to pass - Nebuchadnezzar was just now dead; and
Evil-merodach, his son, succeeded to the kingdom in the thirty-seventh
year of the captivity of Jehoiachin: and on the seven and twentieth day
\[Jeremiah says five and twentieth\] of the twelfth month of that year,
(Tuesday, April 15, A.M. 3442), he brought the long captivated Jewish
king out of prison; treated him kindly; and ever after, during his life,
reckoned him among the king's friends. This is particularly related in
the four last verses of the book of Jeremiah.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg2 25:30</span></span>

A continual allowance given him of the king - He lived in a regal style,
and had his court even in the city of Babylon, being supplied with every
requisite by the munificence and friendship of the king. In about two
years after this, Evil-merodach was slain in a conspiracy; and it is
supposed that Jehoiachin, then about fifty-eight years of age, fell with
his friend and protector. Thus terminates the catastrophe of the Jewish
kings, people, and state; the consequence of unheard-of rebellions and
provocations against the Majesty of heaven.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 25:1</span></span>

In the ninth year of his reign - Zedekiah, having revolted against the
Chaldeans, Nebuchadnezzar, wearied with his treachery, and the bad faith
of the Jews, determined the total subversion of the Jewish state. Having
assembled a numerous army, he entered Judea on the tenth day of the
tenth month of the ninth year of the reign of Zedekiah; this, according
to the computation of Archbishop Usher, was on Thursday, January 30,
A.M. 3414, which was a sabbatical year: whereon the men of Jerusalem
hearing that the Chaldean army was approaching, proclaimed liberty to
their servants; see [Jer 34:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#008.md),
according to the law, [Exo 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#002.md); [Deu
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#001.md), [Deu
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#002.md), [Deu
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#012.md) : for Nebuchadnezzar, marching
with his army against Zedekiah, having wasted all the country, and taken
their strong holds, except Lachish, Azekah, and Jerusalem, came against
the latter with all his forces. See [Jer
34:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#001.md). On the very day, as the same
author computes, the siege and utter destruction of Jerusalem were
revealed to Ezekiel the prophet, then in Chaldea, under the type of a
seething pot; and his wife died in the evening, and he was charged not
to mourn for her, because of the extraordinary calamity that had fallen
upon the land. See [Eze 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#001.md), [Eze
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#002.md), etc.

Jeremiah, having predicted the same calamities, [Jer
34:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#001.md), was by the command of Zedekiah
shut up in prison, Jeremiah 32:1-16.

Pharaoh Hophra, or Vaphris, hearing how Zedekiah was pressed, and
fearing for the safety of his own dominions should the Chaldeans succeed
against Jerusalem, determined to succor Zedekiah. Finding this, the
Chaldeans raised the siege of Jerusalem, and went to meet the Egyptian
army, which they defeated and put to flight. Joseph. Antiq., lib. 10,
cap. 10. In the interim the Jews, thinking their danger was passed,
reclaimed their servants, and put them again under the yoke; [Jer
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#008.md), etc.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 25:2</span></span>

And the city was besieged, etc. - Nebuchadnezzar, having routed the
Egyptian army, returned to Jerusalem, and besieged it so closely that,
being reduced by famine, and a breach made in the wall, the Chaldeans
entered it on the ninth day of the fourth month, (Wednesday, July 27),
Zedekiah and many others endeavoring to make their escape by night.
