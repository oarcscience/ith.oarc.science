### [Deuteronomy Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 18:0</span></span>

The priests and Levites to have no inheritance, [Deu
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#001.md), [Deu
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#002.md). What is the priest's due, [Deu
18:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#003.md). Of the Levites that come from
any of the other cities, [Deu 18:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#006.md).
The Israelites must not copy the abominations of the former inhabitants,
[Deu 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#009.md). None to cause his son or
daughter to pass through the fire, or use any kind of divination or
enchantment, as the former inhabitants did, [Deu
18:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#010.md). The great prophet which God
promised to raise up, [Deu 18:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015.md).
Of false prophets, [Deu 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#020.md); and how
to discern them, [Deu 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#021.md), [Deu
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#022.md).

[Deuteronomy 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 18:1</span></span>

The priests the Levites - shall have no part - That is, says Rab.
Maimon, they shall have no part in the spoils taken from an enemy.

[Deuteronomy 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 18:2</span></span>

The Lord is their inheritance - He is the portion of their souls; and as
to their bodies, they shall live by the offerings of the Lord made by
fire, i. e., the meat-offering, the sin-offering, and the
trespass-offering; and whatever was the Lord's right, in these or other
offerings, he gave to the priests.

[Deuteronomy 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 18:3</span></span>

Offer a sacrifice - זבחי הזבח zobechey hazzebach. The word זבח zebach is
used to signify, not only an animal sacrificed to the Lord, but also one
killed for common use. See [Gen 46:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#001.md);
[Pro 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#001.md); [Eze
39:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#017.md). And in this latter sense it
probably should be understood here; and, consequently, the command in
this verse relates to what the people were to allow the priests and
Levites from the animals slain for common use. The parts to be given to
the priests were,

1\. The shoulder, probably cut off from the beast with the skin on; so
Maimonides.

2\. The two cheeks, which may include the whole head.

3\. The maw - the whole of those intestines which are commonly used for
food.

[Deuteronomy 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 18:4</span></span>

The first-fruit also of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, etc. -
All these firstfruits and firstlings were the Lord's portion, and these
he gave to the priests.

[Deuteronomy 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 18:8</span></span>

The sale of his patrimony - So we find that, though the Levites might
have no part of the land by lot, yet they were permitted to make
purchases of houses, goods, and cattle, yea, of fields also. See the
case of Abiathar, [Kg1 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#026) (note.md),
and of Jeremiah, [Jer 32:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#007) (note.md).

[Deuteronomy 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 18:10</span></span>

To pass through the fire - Probably in the way of consecration to
Molech, or some other deity. It is not likely that their being burnt to
death is here intended. See on [Lev
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021) (note.md).

Divination - קסם קסמים kosem kesamim, one who endeavors to find out
futurity by auguries, using lots, etc.

Observer of times - מעונן meonen, one who pretends to foretell future
events by present occurrences, and who predicts great political or
physical changes from the aspects of the planets, eclipses, motion of
the clouds, etc., etc. See on [Gen
41:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#008) (note.md).

Enchanter - מנחש menachesh, from נחש nichesh, to view attentively; one
who inspected the entrails of beasts, observed the flight of birds,
etc., etc., and drew auguries thence. Some think divination by serpents
is meant, which was common among the heathen.

A witch - מחשף mechashsheph, probably those who by means of drugs,
herbs, perfumes, etc., pretended to bring certain celestial influences
to their aid. See the note on [Lev
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#026.md).

[Deuteronomy 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 18:11</span></span>

A charmer - חבר חבר chober chaber, one who uses spells; a peculiar
conjunction, as the term implies, of words, or things, tying knots,
etc., for the purposes of divination. This was a custom among the
heathen, as we learn from the following verses: -

Necte Tribus Nodis ternos, Amarylli, colores:

Necte, Amarylli, modo; et Veneris, dic, vincula necto.

Virg. Ecl. viii., ver. 77.

"Knit with three Knots the fillets, knit them straight;

Then say, these Knots to love I consecrate."

Dryden.

A consulter with familiar spirits - שאל אוב shoel ob, a Pythoness, one
who inquires by the means of one spirit to get oracular answers from
another of a superior order. See on [Lev
19:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#031) (note.md).

A wizard - ידעני yiddeoni, a wise one, a knowing one. Wizard was
formerly considered as the masculine of witch, both practising
divination by similar means. See on [Exo
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#013) (note.md), and [Lev
19:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#031) (note.md).

Or a necromancer - דרש אל המתים doresh el hammethim, one who seeks from
or inquires of the dead. Such as the witch at Endor, who professed to
evoke the dead, in order to get them to disclose the secrets of the
spiritual world.

[Deuteronomy 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 18:15</span></span>

The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet - Instead of
diviners, observers of times, etc., God here promises to give them an
infallible guide, who should tell them all things that make for their
peace, so that his declarations should completely answer the end of all
the knowledge that was pretended to be gained by the persons already
specified.

Like unto me - Viz., a prophet, a legislator, a king, a mediator, and
the head or chief of the people of God. This was the very person of whom
Moses was the type, and who should accomplish all the great purposes of
the Divine Being. Such a prophet as had never before appeared, and who
should have no equal till the consummation of the world.

This prophet is the Lord Jesus, who was in the bosom of the Father, and
who came to declare him to mankind. Every word spoken by him is a living
infallible oracle from God himself; and must be received and obeyed as
such, on pain of the eternal displeasure of the Almighty. See [Deu
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#019.md), and [Act
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#022.md), [Act
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#023.md); and see the conclusion of this
chapter, [Deu 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#022) (note.md).

[Deuteronomy 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">deu 18:22</span></span>

If the thing follow not - It is worthy of remark that the prophets in
general predicted those things which were shortly to come to pass, that
the people might have the fullest proof of their Divine mission, and of
the existence of God's providence in the administration of the affairs
of men.

The promise contained in the [Deu
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015.md) and [Deu
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#018.md) verses of this chapter has long
been considered of the first importance in the controversies between the
Christians and Jews. "Christ," says Ainsworth, "was to be a man, and of
the stock of the Jews, by promise, because the people could not endure
to hear the voice of God, [Deu 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#016.md).
And as in respect of his prophecy, so of the priesthood: for every high
priest is taken from among men, [Heb
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#001.md); and also of his kingdom, as in
[Deu 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#015.md) : From among thy brethren
shalt thou set a king over thee like unto me.

"1. Christ alone was like unto Moses as a Prophet; for it is written,
There arose not a prophet in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew
face to face, in all the signs and wonders which the Lord sent him to
do, [Deu 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#010.md), [Deu
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#011.md), [Deu
34:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#012.md). This therefore cannot be
understood of the ordinary prophets which were raised up in Israel, but
of Christ only, as the apostles expound it [Act
2:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#022.md).

2\. Christ was like unto Moses in respect to his office of mediation
between God and his people, [Deu 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#005.md);
[Ti1 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005.md); but greater than Moses as
being the mediator of a better covenant, (or testament), which was
established upon better promises, [Heb
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#006.md).

3\. Christ was like unto Moses in excellency; for as Moses excelled all
the prophets in speaking to God mouth to mouth, [Num
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#006.md), [Num
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#007.md),[Num
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#008.md), so Christ excelled him and all
men in that being in the bosom of the Father, he hath come down from
heaven and declared God unto us, [Joh
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018.md); [Joh
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#013.md).

4\. Christ was like to Moses in faithfulness, but therein also
excelling; for Moses was faithful in God's house as a servant, but
Christ as the son over his own house, [Heb
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#002.md), [Heb
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#005.md), [Heb
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#006.md).

5\. Christ was like to Moses in signs and wonders, wherein he also
excelled Moses, as the history of the Gospel shows; for he was a prophet
mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, [Luk
24:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#019.md). A man approved of God among
them, by miracles, signs, and wonders, which God did by him in the midst
of them, [Act 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#022.md). For he did among
them the works which no other man did, [Joh
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#024.md). Unto him, that is, not unto the
diviners, wizards, or any such like, but unto him, and him only; as Him
thou shalt serve, [Deu 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#013.md), is
expounded, Him only, [Mat 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#010.md). And
though this is principally meant of Christ in person, of whom God said,
Hear him, [Mat 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#005.md); yet it implies
also his ministers, as himself said, He that heareth you heareth me,
[Luk 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#016.md)." To these may be added,

6\. As Moses was king among his people, in this respect Christ is like
to him, but infinitely greater; for he is King of kings and Lord of
lords, [Rev 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#016.md); [Ti1
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#015.md).

7\. He was like to Moses as a legislator. Moses gave laws to Israel by
the authority and commandment of God, which the Jews have ever
acknowledged as coming from the immediate inspiration of the Almighty:
these are contained in the Pentateuch. Christ gave a new law, the Gospel
contained in the four Evangelists and Acts of the Apostles, on which the
Christian Church is founded, and by which all genuine Christians are
governed both in heart and life. To all which may be added,

8\. That God never commissioned any human beings to give laws to mankind
but Moses and Christ; and therefore, as a lawgiver, Christ alone
resembles Moses; for to the present hour none but themselves have given
laws in the name of God, which he has ratified and confirmed by the most
indubitable and infallible signs, proofs, and miracles.

Dr. Jortin, in his Remarks on Ecclesiastical History, has drawn a
parallel between Moses and Christ in a great number of particulars,
which he concludes thus: "Let us search all the records of universal
history, and see if we can find a man who was so like to Moses as Christ
was, and so like to Christ as Moses was. If we cannot find such a one,
then have we found Him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did
write to be Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God." On this subject see
Ainsworth, Calmet, and Dodd, who have all marked this striking
correspondence between Moses and Christ.
