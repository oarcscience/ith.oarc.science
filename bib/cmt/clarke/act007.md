### [Acts Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#001.md)

[Acts](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">act 7:0</span></span>

Stephen, being permitted to answer for himself relative to the charge of
blasphemy brought against him by his accusers, gives a circumstantial
relation of the call of Abraham, when he dwelt in Mesopotamia, in
Charran, etc., [Act 7:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#001.md). The history
of Jacob and Joseph, [Act 7:9-17](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#009.md). The
persecution of their fathers in Egypt, [Act
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#018.md), [Act
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#019.md). The history of Moses and his
acts till the exodus from Egypt, vv. 20-37. The rebellion and idolatry
of the Israelites in the wilderness, [Act
7:38-43](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#038.md) The erection of the tabernacle
of witness, which continued till the time of David, [Act
7:44-46](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#044.md). Of the temple built by
Solomon for that God who cannot be confined to temples built by hands,
[Act 7:47-50](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#047.md). Being probably
interrupted in the prosecution of his discourse, he urges home the
charge of rebellion against God, persecution of his prophets, the murder
of Christ, and neglect of their own law against them, [Act
7:51-53](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#051.md). They are filled with
indignation, and proceed to violence, [Act
7:54](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#054.md). He sees the glory of God, and
Christ at the right hand of the Father; and declares the glorious
vision, [Act 7:55](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#055.md), [Act
7:56](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#056.md). They rush upon him, drag him out
of the city, and stone him, [Act 7:57](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#057.md),
[Act 7:58](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#058.md). He involves the Lord Jesus,
prays for his murderers, and expires, [Act
7:59](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#059.md), [Act
7:60](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#060.md).

[Acts 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 7:1</span></span>

Are these things so? - Hast thou predicted the destruction of the
temple? And hast thou said that Jesus of Nazareth shall change our
customs, abolish our religious rites and temple service? Hast thou
spoken these blasphemous things against Moses, and against God? Here was
some color of justice; for Stephen was permitted to defend himself. And,
in order to do this he thought it best to enter into a detail of their
history from the commencement of their nation; and thus show how kindly
God had dealt with them, and how ungraciously they and their fathers had
requited Him. And all this naturally led him to the conclusion, that God
could no longer bear with a people the cup of whose iniquity had been
long overflowing; and therefore they might expect to find wrath, without
mixture of mercy.

But how could St. Luke get all this circumstantial account? He might
have been present, and heard the whole; or, more probably, he had the
account from St. Paul, whose companion he was, and who was certainly
present when St. Stephen was judged and stoned, for he was consenting to
his death, and kept the clothes of them who stoned him. See [Act
7:58](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#058.md); [Act
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#001.md); [Act
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#020.md).

[Acts 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 7:2</span></span>

Men, brethren, and fathers - Rather, brethren and fathers, for ανδρες
should not be translated separately from αδελφοι. Literally it is
men-brethren, a very usual form in Greek; for every person knows that
ανδρες Αθηναιοι and ανδρες Περσαι should not be translated men-Athenians
and men-Persians, but simply Athenians and Persians. See [Act
17:22](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#022.md). So, in [Luk
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#015.md), ανθρωποι ποιμενες should be
translated shepherds, not men-shepherds. And ανθρωπος βασιλευς [Mat
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#023.md), should not be translated
man-king, but king, simply. By translating as we do, men, brethren, and
fathers, and putting a comma after men, we make Stephen address three
classes, when in fact there were but two: the elders and scribes, whom
he addressed as fathers; and the common people, whom he calls brethren.
See Bp. Pearce, and see [Act 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#027.md).

The God of glory appeared, etc. - As Stephen was now vindicating himself
from the false charges brought against him, he shows that he had uttered
no blasphemy, either against God, Moses, or the temple; but states that
his accusers, and the Jews in general, were guilty of the faults with
which they charged him: that they had from the beginning rejected and
despised Moses, and had always violated his laws. He proceeds to state
that there is no blasphemy in saying that the temple shall be destroyed:
they had been without a temple till the days of David; nor does God ever
confine himself to temples built by hands, seeing he fills both heaven
and earth; that Jesus is the prophet of whom Moses spoke, and whom they
had persecuted, condemned, and at last put to death; that they were
wicked and uncircumcised in heart and in ears, and always resisted the
Holy Ghost as their fathers did. This is the substance of St. Stephen's
defense as far as he was permitted to make it: a defense which they
could not confute; containing charges which they most glaringly
illustrated and confirmed, by adding the murder of this faithful
disciple to that of his all-glorious Master.

Was in Mesopotamia - In that part of it where Ur of the Chaldees was
situated, near to Babel, and among the rivers, (Tigris and Euphrates),
which gave the name of Mesopotamia to the country. See the note on [Gen
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#031.md).

Before he dwelt in Charran - This is called Haran in our translation of
[Gen 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#031.md); this place also belonged
to Mesopotamia, as well as Ur, but is placed west of it on the maps. It
seems most probable that Abraham had two calls, one in Ur, and the other
in Haran. He left Ur at the first call, and came to Haran; he left Haran
at the second call, and came into the promised land. See these things
more particularly stated in the notes on [Gen
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001) (note.md).

[Acts 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 7:4</span></span>

When his father was dead - See the note on [Gen
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#026.md).

[Acts 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 7:5</span></span>

Gave him none inheritance - Both Abraham and Jacob had small parcels of
land in Canaan; but they had them by purchase, not by God's gift; for,
as Abraham was obliged to buy a burying-place in Canaan, Genesis
23:3-18, it is obvious he had no inheritance there.

And to his seed after him - See [Gen
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007) (note.md); [Gen
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#015.md), and the notes there.

[Acts 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 7:6</span></span>

That his seed should sojourn in a strange land - See [Gen
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#013.md), [Gen
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#014.md).

Four hundred years - Moses says, [Exo
12:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#040.md), that the sojourning of the
children of Israel in Egypt - was 430 years. See the note there. St.
Paul has the same number, [Gal 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#017.md);
and so has Josephus, Ant. lib. ii. cap. 1, sect. 9; in Bell. lib. v.
cap. 9, sect. 4. St. Stephen uses the round number of 400, leaving out
the odd tens, a thing very common, not only in the sacred writers, but
in all others, those alone excepted who write professedly on
chronological matters.

[Acts 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 7:7</span></span>

Will I judge - Κρινω εγω, I will punish, for in this sense the Greek
word is frequently taken. "When," says Bp. Pearce, "a malefactor is
brought before a judge, the judge does three things:

1\. he tries or judges him;

2\. he then gives his judgment or sentence; and,

3\. he puts the law in execution, and punishes him.

Hence κρινω, at different times, signifies each of these things; and the
sense of the word is to be determined by the context. Here it signifies
to punish, as κριμα is used for punishment, in [Rom
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#002.md); [Co1
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#029.md), compared with [Co1
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#030.md), [Co1
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#031.md)." The Egyptians, to whom the
Israelites were in bondage, were punished by the ten plagues, described
Exodus 7:19-12:30.

[Acts 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 7:8</span></span>

He gave him the covenant of circumcision - That is, he instituted the
rite of circumcision, as a sign of that covenant which he had made with
him and his posterity. See [Gen 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#010.md),
etc.

And so Abraham begat Isaac - Και οὑτως, And thus, in this covenant, he
begat Isaac; and as a proof that he was born under this covenant, was a
true son of Abraham and inheritor of the promises, he circumcised him
the eighth day; and this rite being observed in the family of Isaac,
Jacob and his twelve sons were born under the covenant; and thus their
descendants, the twelve tribes, being born under the same covenant, and
practising the same rite, were, by the ordinance of Gods legal
inheritors of the promised land, and all the secular and spiritual
advantages connected with it.

[Acts 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 7:9</span></span>

And the patriarchs - The twelve sons of Jacob, thus called because each
was chief or head of his respective family or tribe.

Moved with envy - Ζηλωσαντες. We translate ζηλος variously: zeal or
fervent affection, whether its object be good or bad, is its general
meaning; and ζηλοω signifies to be indignant, envious, etc. See the note
on [Act 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#017.md). The brethren of Joseph,
hearing of his dreams, and understanding them to portend his future
advancement, filled with envy, (with which no ordinary portion of malice
was associated), sold Joseph into the land of Egypt, hoping by this
means to prevent his future grandeur; but God, from whom the portents
came, was with him, and made their envy the direct means of
accomplishing the great design.

[Acts 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 7:10</span></span>

Gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh - God gave him much
wisdom, in consequence of which he had favor with the king of Egypt. See
the whole of this remarkable history explained at large, Genesis
41:1-45:28 (note).

[Acts 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 7:14</span></span>

Threescore and fifteen souls - There are several difficulties here,
which it is hoped the reader will find satisfactorily removed in the
note on [Gen 46:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#020) (note.md). It is well
known that in [Gen 46:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#027.md), and in [Deu
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#022.md), their number is said to be
threescore and ten; but Stephen quotes from the Septuagint, which adds
five persons to the account which are not in the Hebrew text, Machir,
Gilead, Sutelaam, Taham, and Edem; but see the note referred to above.

[Acts 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 7:16</span></span>

And were carried over to Sychem - "It is said, [Gen
50:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#013.md), that Jacob was buried in the
cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre. And in [Jos
24:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#032.md), and [Exo
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#019.md), it is said that the bones of
Joseph were carried out of Egypt by the Israelites, and buried in
Shechem, which Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor the father of
Shechem. As for the eleven brethren of Joseph, we are told by Josephus,
Ant. lib. ii. cap. 8. sect. 2, that they were buried in Hebron, where
their father had been buried. But, since the books of the Old Testament
say nothing about this, the authority of Stephen (or of Luke here) for
their being buried in Sychem is at least as good as that of Josephus for
their being buried in Hebron." - Bp. Pearce.

We have the uniform consent of the Jewish writers that all the
patriarchs were brought out of Egypt, and buried in Canaan, but none,
except Stephen, mentions their being buried in Sychem. As Sychem
belonged to the Samaritans, probably the Jews thought it too great an
honor for that people to possess the bones of the patriarchs; and
therefore have carefully avoided making any mention of it. This is Dr.
Lightfoot's conjecture; and it is as probable as any other.

That Abraham bought for a sum of money - Two accounts seem here to be
confounded:

1\. The purchase made by Abraham of the cave and field of Ephron, which
was in the field of Machpelah: this purchase was made from the children
of Heth, [Gen 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#003.md), [Gen
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#010.md), [Gen
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#017.md).

2\. The purchase made by Jacob, from the sons of Hamor or Emmor, of a
sepulchre in which the bones of Joseph were laid: this was in Sychem or
Shechem, [Gen 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#019.md); [Jos
24:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#032.md).

The word Abraham, therefore, in this place, is certainly a mistake; and
the word Jacob, which some have supplied, is doubtless more proper. Bp.
Pearce supposes that Luke originally wrote, ὁ ωνησατο τιμης αργυριου,
which he bought for a sum of money: i.e. which Jacob bought, who is the
last person, of the singular number, spoken of in the preceding verse.
Those who saw that the word ωνησατο, bought, had no nominative case
joined to it, and did not know where to find the proper one, seem to
have inserted Αβρααμ, Abraham, in the text, for that purpose, without
sufficiently attending to the different circumstances of his purchase
from that of Jacob's.

[Acts 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 7:18</span></span>

Which knew not Joseph - That is, did not approve of him, of his mode of
governing the kingdom, nor of his people, nor of his God. See the note
on [Exo 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#008.md).

[Acts 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 7:19</span></span>

The same dealt subtilty - Οὑτος κατασοφισαμενος, A word borrowed from
the Septuagint, who thus translate the Hebrew נהחכמה לו nithchokmah lo,
let us deal wisely with it, i.e. with cunning and deceit, as the Greek
word implies; and which is evidently intended by the Hebrew. See [Gen
27:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#035.md), Thy brother came with subtilty,
which the Targumist explains by בחוכמא be-chokma, with wisdom, that is,
cunning and deceit. For this the Egyptians were so remarkable that
αιγυπτιαζειν, to Egyptize, signified to act cunningly, and to use wicked
devices. Hence the Jews compared them to foxes; and it is of them that
Canticles, [Sol 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#015.md), is understood by
the rabbins: Take us the little foxes which spoil our vines; destroy the
Egyptians, who, having slain our male children, sought to destroy the
name of Israel from the face of the earth.

To the end they might not live - Might not grow up and propagate, and
thus build up the Hebrew nation.

[Acts 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 7:20</span></span>

Moses - was exceeding fair - ΑϚειος τῳ Θεῳ, Was fair to God, i.e. was
divinely beautiful. See the note on [Exo
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#002.md).

[Acts 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 7:22</span></span>

In all the wisdom of the Egyptians - Who were, at that time, the most
intelligent and best instructed people in the universe. Philo says,
Moses was taught arithmetic, geometry, poetry, music, medicine, and the
knowledge of hieroglyphics. In Sohar Cadash, fol. 46, it is said, "that,
of the ten portions of wisdom which came into the world, the Egyptians
had nine, and that all the inhabitants of the earth had only the
remaining portion." Much of the same nature may be seen in the rabbins,
though they apply the term wisdom here to magic.

Was mighty in words and in deeds - This may refer to the glorious
doctrines he taught, and the miracles he wrought in Egypt. Josephus Ant.
lib. ii. cap. 10, sect. 1, gives an account of his being general of an
Egyptian army, defeating the Ethiopians, who had invaded Egypt, driving
them back into their own country, and taking Saba their capital, which
was afterwards called Meroe. But this, like many other tales of the same
writer, is worthy of little credit.

Phoenix says the same of Achilles: -

Μυθων τε ῥητηρ' εμεναι, πρηκτηρα τε εργων.

Il. ix. v. 443.

Not only an orator of words, but a performer of deeds.

[Acts 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 7:23</span></span>

When he was full forty years old - This was a general tradition among
the Jews: "Moses was forty years in Pharaoh's court, forty years in
Midian, and forty years he served Israel."

To visit his brethren - Probably on the ground of trying to deliver them
from their oppressive bondage. This desire seems to have been early
infused into his mind by the Spirit of God; and the effect of this
desire to deliver his oppressed countrymen was his refusing to be called
the son of Pharaoh's daughter - see [Heb
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#024.md), and thus renouncing all right
to the Egyptian crown, choosing rather to endure addiction with the
people of God than enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.

[Acts 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 7:24</span></span>

Smote the Egyptian - See this explained, [Exo
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#011.md), [Exo
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#012) (note.md).

[Acts 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 7:25</span></span>

He supposed his brethren would have understood, etc. - He probably
imagined that, as he felt from the Divine influence he was appointed to
be their deliverer, they would have his Divine appointment signified to
them in a similar way; and the act of justice which he now did in behalf
of his oppressed countryman would be sufficient to show them that he was
now ready to enter upon his office, if they were willing to concur.

[Acts 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 7:26</span></span>

Unto them as they strove - Two Hebrews, See on [Exo
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#013) (note.md), etc.

[Acts 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 7:30</span></span>

In a flame of fire in a bush - See this and the following verses largely
explained in the notes on [Exo 3:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#001.md)
(note).

[Acts 7:36](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">act 7:36</span></span>

He brought them out, after that he had showed wonders, etc. - Thus the
very person whom they had rejected, and, in effect, delivered up into
the hands of Pharaoh that he might be slain, was the person alone by
whom they were redeemed from their Egyptian bondage. And does not St.
Stephen plainly say by this, that the very person, Jesus Christ, whom
they had rejected and delivered up into the hands of Pilate to be
crucified, was the person alone by whom they could be delivered out of
their spiritual bondage, and made partakers of the inheritance among the
saints in light? No doubt they felt that this was the drift of his
speech.

[Acts 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">act 7:37</span></span>

This is that Moses, which said - A prophet, etc. - This very Moses, so
highly esteemed and honored by God, announced that very prophet whom ye
have lately put to death. See the observations at [Deu
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#022) (note.md).

[Acts 7:38](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">act 7:38</span></span>

With the angel which spake to him - Stephen shows that Moses received
the law by the ministry of angels; and that he was only a mediator
between the angel of God and them.

The lively oracles - Λογια ζωντα, The living oracles. The doctrines of
life, those doctrines - obedience to which entitled them, by the promise
of God, to a long life upon earth, which spoke to them of that spiritual
life which every true believer has in union with his God, and promised
that eternal life which those who are faithful unto death shall enjoy
with him in the realms of glory.

The Greek word λογιον, which we translate oracle, signifies a Divine
revelation, a communication from God himself, and is here applied to the
Mosaic law; to the Old Testament in general, [Rom
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#002.md); [Heb
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#012.md); and to Divine revelation in
general, [Pe1 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#011.md).

[Acts 7:39](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">act 7:39</span></span>

In their hearts turned back again into Egypt - Became idolaters, and
preferred their Egyptian bondage and their idolatry to the promised land
and the pure worship of God. See the whole of these transactions
explained at large in the notes on Exodus 32:1-35 (note).

[Acts 7:42](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">act 7:42</span></span>

Then God turned, and gave them up, etc. - He left them to themselves,
and then they deified and worshipped the sun, moon, planets, and
principal stars.

In the book of the prophets - As this quotation is found in Amos, [Amo
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#025.md), by the book of the prophets is
meant the twelve minor prophets, which, in the ancient Jewish division
of the sacred writings, formed only one book.

Have ye offered to me slain beasts - It is certain that the Israelites
did offer various sacrifices to God, while in the wilderness; and it is
as certain that they scarcely ever did it with an upright heart. They
were idolatrous, either in heart or act, in almost all their religious
services; these were therefore so very imperfect that they were counted
for nothing in the sight of God; for this seems to be strongly implied
in the question here asked, Have ye offered to Me (exclusively and with
an upright heart) slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty
years? On the contrary, these forty years were little else than a tissue
of rebellion and idolatry.

[Acts 7:43](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">act 7:43</span></span>

Ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan,
figures which ye made to worship them - This is a literal translation of
the place, as it stands in the Septuagint; but in the Hebrew text it
stands thus: But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Molech, and Chiun,
your images, the star of your god which ye made to yourselves. This is
the simple version of the place, unless we should translate ונסאתם את
סכות מלככם venasatem eth Siccuth malkekem, ye took Sikuth your king,
(instead of ye took up the tabernacle of your Molek), as some have done.
The place is indeed very obscure, and the two texts do not tend to cast
light on each other. The rabbins say siccuth, which we translate
tabernacle, is the name of an idol. Molech is generally understood to
mean the sun; and several persons of good judgment think that by Remphan
or Raiphan is meant the planet Saturn, which the Copts call Ῥηφαν,
Rephan. It will be seen above that instead of Remphan, or, as some of
the best MSS. have it, Rephan, the Hebrew text has כיון Chiun, which
might possibly be a corruption of ריפן Reiphan, as it would be very easy
to mistake the כ caph for ר resh, and the vau shurek ו for פ pe. This
emendation would bring the Hebrew, Septuagint, and the text of Luke,
nearer together; but there is no authority either from MSS. or versions
for this correction: however, as Chiun is mentioned in no other place,
though Molech often occurs, it is the more likely that there might have
been some very early mistake in the text, and that the Septuagint has
preserved the true reading.

It was customary for the idolaters of all nations to carry images of
their gods about them in their journeys, military expeditions, etc.; and
these, being very small, were enclosed in little boxes, perhaps some of
them in the shape of temples, called tabernacles; or, as we have it,
[Act 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#024.md), shrines. These little gods
were the penates and lares among the Romans, and the tselems or
talismans among the ancient eastern idolaters. The Hebrew text seems to
refer to these when it says, the tabernacle of your Molech, and Chiun,
your images, צלמיכם tsalmeycem, your tselems, τους τυπους, the types or
simulachres of your gods. See the note on [Gen
31:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#019.md). Many of those small portable
images are now in my own collection, all of copper or brass; some of
them the identical penates of the ancient Romans, and others the
offspring of the Hindoo idolatry; they are from an ounce weight to half
a pound. Such images as these I suppose the idolatrous Israelites, in
imitation of their neighbors, the Moabites, Ammonites, etc., to have
carried about with them; and to such the prophet appears to me
unquestionably to allude.

I will carry you away beyond Babylon - You have carried your idolatrous
images about; and I will carry you into captivity, and see if the gods
in whom ye have trusted can deliver you from my hands. Instead of beyond
Babylon, Amos, from whom the quotation is made, says, I will carry you
beyond Damascus. Where they were carried was into Assyria and Media, see
[Kg2 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006.md) : now, this was not only
beyond Damascus, but beyond Babylon itself; and, as Stephen knew this to
be the fact, he states it here, and thus more precisely fixes the place
of their captivity. The Holy Spirit, in his farther revelations, has
undoubted right to extend or illustrate those which he had given before.
This case frequently occurs when a former prophecy is quoted in later
times.

[Acts 7:44](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">act 7:44</span></span>

Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness - That is,
the tabernacle in which the two tables of stone written by the finger of
God were laid up, as a testimony that he had delivered these laws to the
people, and that they had promised to obey them. As one great design of
St. Stephen was to show the Jews that they placed too much dependence on
outward privileges, and had not used the law, the tabernacle, the
temple, nor the temple service, for the purpose of their institution, he
labors to bring them to a due sense of this, that conviction might lead
to repentance and conversion. And he farther shows that God did not
confine his worship to one place, or form. He was worshipped without any
shrine in the times of the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, etc. He
was worshipped with a tabernacle, or portable temple, in the wilderness.
He was worshipped also in the fixed temple projected by David, but built
by Solomon. He asserts farther that his infinite majesty cannot be
confined to temples, made by human hands; and where there is neither
tabernacle nor temple, (in any part of his vast dominions), he may be
worshipped acceptably by the upright in heart. Thus he proves that
neither tabernacle nor temple are essentially requisite for the true
worship of the true God. Concerning the tabernacle to which St. Stephen
here refers, the reader is requested to consult the notes on [Exo
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#008.md), etc., and the subsequent
chapters.

Speaking unto Moses - Ὁ λαλων, Who spake, as in the margin; signifying
the angel of God who spake to Moses, or God himself. See [Exo
25:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#040.md).

[Acts 7:45](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">act 7:45</span></span>

Brought in with Jesus - That is, with Joshua, whom the Greek version,
quoted by St. Stephen, always writes Ιησους, Jesus, but which should
constantly be written Joshua in such cases as the present, in order to
avoid ambiguity and confusion.

Possession of the Gentiles - Των εθνων, of the heathens, whom Joshua
conquered, and gave their land to the children of Israel.

[Acts 7:46](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">act 7:46</span></span>

Desired to find a tabernacle - This was in David's heart, and it met
with the Divine approbation: see [Sa2
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#002.md), etc., and see the purpose, [Psa
132:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#002.md); but, as David had been a man
of war, and had shed much blood, God would not permit him to build the
temple; but he laid the plan and made provision for it, and Solomon
executed the design.

[Acts 7:48](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">act 7:48</span></span>

The Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands - Here St. Stephen
evidently refers to Solomon's speech, [Kg1
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#027.md). But will God indeed dwell on the
earth? Behold, the heaven, and the heaven of heavens cannot contain
thee, how much less this house that I have builded? Both Solomon and St.
Stephen mean that the majesty of God could not be contained, not even in
the whole vortex of nature; much less in any temple which human hands
could erect.

As saith the prophet - The place referred to is [Isa
66:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#001.md), [Isa
66:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#002.md) : Thus saith the Lord, the heaven
is my throne, and the earth my footstool. Where is the house that ye
build unto me? And where is the place of my rest, etc., with which the
quotation by Stephen agrees.

[Acts 7:50](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">act 7:50</span></span>

Hath not my hand made all these things? - Stephen certainly had not
finished his discourse, nor drawn his inferences from the facts already
stated; but it is likely that, as they perceived he was about to draw
conclusions unfavourable to the temple and its ritual, they immediately
raised up a clamor against him, which was the cause of the following
very cutting address.

[Acts 7:51](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">act 7:51</span></span>

Ye stiff-necked - Σκληροτραχηλοι. A metaphor taken from untoward oxen,
who cannot be broken into the yoke; and whose strong necks cannot be
bended to the right or the left.

Uncircumcised in heart and ears - This was a Jewish mode of speech,
often used by the prophets. Circumcision was instituted, not only as a
sign and seal of the covenant into which the Israelites entered with
their Maker, but also as a type of that purity and holiness which the
law of God requires; hence there was an excision of what was deemed not
only superfluous but also injurious; and by this cutting off, the
propensity to that crime which ruins the body, debases the mind, and was
generally the forerunner of idolatry, was happily lessened. It would be
easy to prove this, were not the subject too delicate. Where the spirit
of disobedience was found, where the heart was prone to iniquity, and
the ears impatient of reproof and counsel, the person is represented as
uncircumcised in those parts, because devoted to iniquity, impatient of
reproof, and refusing to obey. In Pirkey Eliezer, chap. 29, "Rabbi Seira
said, There are five species of uncircumcision in the world; four in
man, and one in trees. Those in man are the following: -

"1. Uncircumcision of the Ear. Behold, their Ear is uncircumcised, and
they cannot hearken, [Jer 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#010.md).

"2. The uncircumcision of the Lips. How shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of
uncircumcised Lips? [Exo 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#012.md).

"3. Uncircumcision of Heart. If then their uncircumcised Hearts be
humbled, [Lev 26:41](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#041.md). Circumcise
therefore the Foreskin of Your Heart, [Deu
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#016.md); [Jer
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#004.md). For all the house of Israel are
uncircumcised in the Heart, [Jer 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#026.md).

"4. The uncircumcision of the Flesh. Ye shall circumcise the Flesh of
your Foreskin, etc., [Gen 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#011.md)."

Ye do always resist the Holy Ghost -

1\. Because they were uncircumcised in heart, they always resisted the
influences of the Holy Spirit, bringing light and conviction to their
minds; in consequence of which they became hardened through the
deceitfulness of sin, and neither repented at the preaching of John, nor
credited the glad tidings told them by Christ and the apostles.

2\. Because they were uncircumcised in ears, they would neither hear nor
obey Moses, the prophets, Christ, nor the apostles.

As your fathers did, so do ye - They were disobedient children, of
disobedient parents: in all their generations they had been disobedient
and perverse. This whole people, as well as this text, are fearful
proofs that the Holy Spirit, the almighty energy of the living God, may
be resisted and rendered of none effect. This Spirit is not sent to
stocks, stones, or machines, but to human beings endued with rational
souls; therefore it is not to work on them with that irresistible energy
which it must exert on inert matter, in order to conquer the vis
inertiae or disposition to abide eternally in a motionless state, which
is the state of all inanimate beings; but it works upon understanding,
will, judgment, conscience, etc., in order to enlighten, convince, and
persuade. If, after all, the understanding, the eye of the mind, refuses
to behold the light; the will determines to remain obstinate; the
judgment purposes to draw false inferences; and the conscience hardens
itself against every check and remonstrance, (and all this is possible
to a rational soul, which must be dealt with in a rational way), then
the Spirit of God, being thus resisted, is grieved, and the sinner is
left to reap the fruit of his doings. To force the man to see, feel,
repent, believe, and be saved, would be to alter the essential
principles of his creation and the nature of mind, and reduce him into
the state of a machine, the vis inertiae of which was to be overcome and
conducted by a certain quantum of physical force, superior to that
resistance which would be the natural effect of the certain quantum of
the vis inertiae possessed by the subject on and by which this agent was
to operate. Now, man cannot be operated on in this way, because it is
contrary to the laws of his creation and nature; nor can the Holy Ghost
work on that as a machine which himself has made a free agent. Man
therefore may, and generally does, resist the Holy Ghost; and the whole
revelation of God bears unequivocal testimony to this most dreadful
possibility, and most awful truth. It is trifling with the sacred text
to say that resisting the Holy Ghost here means resisting the laws of
Moses, the exhortations, threatenings, and promises of the prophets,
etc. These, it is true, the uncircumcised ear may resist; but the
uncircumcised heart is that alone to which the Spirit that gave the
laws, exhortations, promises, etc;, speaks; and, as matter resists
matter, so spirit resists spirit. These were not only uncircumcised in
ear, but uncircumcised also in heart; and therefore they resisted the
Holy Ghost, not only in his declarations and institutions, but also in
his actual energetic operations upon their minds.

[Acts 7:52](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">act 7:52</span></span>

Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? - Ye have not
only resisted the Holy Ghost, but ye have persecuted all those who have
spoken to you in his name, and by his influence: thus ye prove your
opposition to the Spirit himself, by your opposition to every thing that
proceeds from him.

They have slain them, etc. - Isaiah, who showed before of the coming of
Christ, the Jews report, was sawn asunder at the command of Manasseh.

The coming of the Just One - Του δικαιου, Meaning Jesus Christ;
emphatically called the just or righteous person, not only because of
the unspotted integrity of his heart and life, but because of his
plenary acquittal, when tried at the tribunal of Pilate: I find no fault
at all in him. The mention of this circumstance served greatly to
aggravate their guilt. The character of Just One is applied to our Lord
in three other places of Scripture: [Act
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#014.md); [Act
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#014.md); and [Jam
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#006.md).

The betrayers and murderers - Ye first delivered him up into the hands
of the Romans, hoping they would have put him to death; but, when they
acquitted him, then, in opposition to the declaration of his innocence,
and in outrage to every form of justice, ye took and murdered him. This
was a most terrible charge; and one against which they could set up no
sort of defense. No wonder, then, that they were instigated by the
spirit of the old destroyer, which they never resisted, to add another
murder to that of which they had been so recently guilty.

[Acts 7:53](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">act 7:53</span></span>

By the disposition of angels - Εις διαταγας αγγελων. After all that has
been said on this difficult passage, perhaps the simple meaning is, that
there were ranks, διαταγαι, of angels attending on the Divine Majesty
when he gave the law: a circumstance which must have added greatly to
the grandeur and solemnity of the occasion; and to this [Psa
68:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#017.md) seems to me most evidently to
allude: The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even many thousands of
angels: the Lord is among them as in Sinai, in the holy place. It was
not then by the mouths nor by the hands of angels, as prime agents, that
Moses, and through him the people, received the law; but God himself
gave it, accompanied with many thousands of those glorious beings. As it
is probable they might be assisting in this most glorious solemnity,
therefore St. Paul might say, [Gal
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019.md), that it was ordained by angels,
διαταγεις δι' αγγελων, in the hand of a Mediator. And as they were the
only persons that could appear, for no man hath seen God at any time,
therefore the apostle might say farther, (if indeed he refers to the
same transaction, see the note there), the word spoken by angels was
steadfast, [Heb 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#002.md). But the
circumstances of this case are not sufficiently plain to lead to the
knowledge of what was done by the angels in this most wonderful
transaction; only we learn, from the use made of this circumstance by
St. Stephen, that it added much to the enormity of their transgression,
that they did not keep a law, in dispensing of which the ministry of
angels had been employed. Some think Moses, Aaron, and Joshua are the
angels here intended; and others think that the fire, light, darkness,
cloud and thick darkness were the angels which Jehovah used on this
occasion, and to which St. Stephen refers; but neither of these senses
appears sufficiently natural, and particularly the latter.

[Acts 7:54](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#054.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">act 7:54</span></span>

They were cut to the heart - Διεπριοντο, They were sawn through. See the
note on [Act 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#033.md).

They gnashed on him with their teeth - They were determined to hear him
no longer; were filled with rage against him, and evidently thirsted for
his blood.

[Acts 7:55](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#055.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">act 7:55</span></span>

Saw the glory of God - The Shekinah, the splendor or manifestation of
the Divine Majesty.

And Jesus standing on the right hand of God - In his official character,
as Mediator between God and man. Stephen had this revelation while in
the Sanhedrin; for as yet he had not been forced out of the city. See
[Act 7:58](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#058.md).

[Acts 7:57](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#057.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">act 7:57</span></span>

They - stopped their ears - As a proof that he had uttered blasphemy,
because he said, He saw Jesus standing at the right hand of God. This
was a fearful proof against them; for if Jesus was at the right hand of
God, then they had murdered an innocent person; and they must infer that
God's justice must speedily avenge his death. They were determined not
to suffer a man to live any longer who could say he saw the heavens
opened and Jesus Christ standing at the right hand of God.

[Acts 7:58](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#058.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">act 7:58</span></span>

Cast him out of the city, and stoned him - They did not however wait for
any sentence to be pronounced upon him; it seems they were determined to
stone him first, and then prove, after it had been done, that it was
done justly. For the manner of stoning among the Jews, see the note on
[Lev 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#023.md).

The witnesses laid down their clothes - To illustrate this whole
transaction, see the observations at the end of this chapter.

[Acts 7:59](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#059.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_059">act 7:59</span></span>

And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God - The word God is not found in
any MS. or version, nor in any of the primitive fathers except
Chrysostom. It is not genuine, and should not be inserted here: the
whole sentence literally reads thus: And they stoned Stephen, invoking
and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit! Here is a most manifest proof
that prayer is offered to Jesus Christ; and that in the most solemn
circumstances in which it could be offered, viz., when a man was
breathing his last. This is, properly speaking, one of the highest acts
of worship which can be offered to God; and, if Stephen had not
conceived Jesus Christ to be God, could he have committed his soul into
his hands?

We may farther observe that this place affords a full proof of the
immateriality of the soul; for he could not have commended his spirit to
Christ, had he believed that he had no spirit, or, in other words, that
his body and soul were one and the same thing. Allowing this most
eminent saint to have had a correct notion of theology, and that, being
full of the Holy Ghost, as he was at this time, he could make no mistake
in matters of such vast weight and importance, then these two points are
satisfactorily stated in this verse:

1\. That Jesus Christ is God; for Stephen died praying to him.

2\. That the soul is immaterial; for Stephen, in dying, commends his
departing spirit into the hand of Christ.

[Acts 7:60](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#060.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_060">act 7:60</span></span>

He kneeled down - That he might die as the subject of his heavenly
Master - acting and suffering in the deepest submission to his Divine
will and permissive providence; and, at the same time, showing the
genuine nature of the religion of his Lord, in pouring out his prayers
with his blood in behalf of his murderers!

Lay not this sin to their charge - That is, do not impute it to them so
as to exact punishment. How much did the servant resemble his Lord,
Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do! This was the cry
of our Lord in behalf of his murderers; and the disciple, closely
copying his Master, in the same spirit, and with the same meaning,
varies the expression, crying with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin
to their charge! What an extent of benevolence! And in what a beautiful
light does this place the spirit of the Christian religion! Christ had
given what some have supposed to be an impossible command; Love your
enemies; pray for them that despitefully use and persecute you. And
Stephen shows here, in his own person, how practicable the grace of his
Master had made this sublime precept.

He fell asleep - This was a common expression among the Jews to signify
death, and especially the death of good men. But this sleep is, properly
speaking, not attributable to the soul, but to the body; for he had
commended his spirit to the Lord Jesus, while his body was overwhelmed
with the shower of stones cast on him by the mob.

After the word εκοιμηθη, fell asleep, one MS. adds, εν ειρηνῃ, in peace;
and the Vulgate has, in Domino, in the Lord. Both these readings are
true, as to the state of St. Stephen; but I believe neither of them was
written by St. Luke.

The first clause of the next chapter should come in here, And Saul was
consenting unto his death: never was there a worse division than that
which separated it from the end of this chapter: this should be
immediately altered, and the amputated member restored to the body to
which it belongs.

1\. Though I have spoken pretty much at large on the punishment of
stoning among the Jews, in the note on [Lev
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#023.md), yet, as the following extracts
will serve to bring the subject more fully into view, in reference to
the case of St. Stephen, the reader will not be displeased to find them
here. Dr. Lightfoot sums up the evidence he has collected on this
subject, in the following particulars: -

"I. The place of stoning was without the sanhedrin, according as it is
said, bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp, [Lev
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#014.md). It is a tradition, the place of
stoning was without three camps. The gloss tells us that the court was
the camp of the Divine Presence; the mountain of the temple, the camp of
the Levites; and Jerusalem, the camp of Israel. Now, in every sanhedrin,
in whatever city, the place of stoning was without the city, as it was
at Jerusalem.

We are told the reason by the Gemarists, why the place of stoning was
without the sanhedrin, and again without three camps: viz. If the
Sanhedrin go forth and sit without the three camps, they make the place
for stoning also distant from the sanhedrin, partly lest the sanhedrin
should seem to kill the man; partly, that by the distance of the place
there may be a little stop and space of time before the criminal come to
the place of execution, if peradventure any one might offer some
testimony that might make for him; for in the expectation of some such
thing: -

"II. There stood one at the door of the sanhedrin having a handkerchief
in his hand, and a horse at such a distance as it was only within sight.
If any one therefore say, I have something to offer in behalf of the
condemned person, he waves the handkerchief, and the horseman rides and
calls back the people. Nay, if the man himself say, I have something to
offer in my own defense, they bring him back four or five times one
after another, if it be any thing of moment that he hath to say." I
doubt they hardly dealt so gently with the innocent Stephen.

"III. If no testimony arise that makes any thing for him, then they go
on to stoning him: the crier proclaiming before him, 'N. the son of N.
comes forth to be stoned for such or such a crime. N. and N. are the
witnesses against him; if any one have any thing to testify in his
behalf, let him come forth and give his evidence.'

"IV. When they come within ten cubits of the place where he must be
stoned, they exhort him to confess, for so it is the custom for the
malefactor to confess, because every one that confesseth hath his part
in the world to come, as we find in the instance of Achan, etc.

"V. When they come within four cubits of the place, they strip off his
clothes, and make him naked.

"VI. The place of execution was twice a man's height. One of the
witnesses throws him down upon his loins; if he roll on his breast, they
turn him on his loins again. If he die so, well. If not, then the other
witness takes up a stone, and lays it upon his heart. If he die so,
well. If not, he is stoned by all Israel.

"VII. All that are stoned, are handed also, etc." These things I thought
fit to transcribe the more largely, that the reader may compare this
present action with this rule and common usage of doing it.

"1. It may be questioned for what crime this person was condemned to
die? You will say for blasphemy for the have heard him speak blasphemous
words against Moses and against God. But no one is condemned as a
blasphemer, unless for abusing the sacred name with four letters, viz.
יהוה YeHoVaH. Hence it is that although they oftentimes accused our
Savior as a blasphemer, yet he was not condemned for this, but because
he used witchcraft and deceived Israel, and seduced them into apostasy.
And those are reckoned among persons that are to be stoned: He that
evilly persuades; and he that draws into apostasy; and he that is a
conjuror.

"2. It may farther be questioned whether our blessed martyr was
condemned by any formal sentence of the sanhedrin, or hurried in a
tumultuary manner by the people; and so murdered: it seems to be the
latter."

2\. The defense of Stephen against the charges produced by his accusers
must be considered as being indirect; as they had a show of truth for
the ground of their accusations, it would have been improper at once to
have roundly denied the charge. There is no doubt that Stephen had
asserted and proved Jesus to be the Christ or Messiah; and that the
whole nation should consider him as such, receive his doctrine, obey
him, or expose themselves to the terrible sentence denounced in the
prophecy of Moses: Whosoever will not hearken unto my words, which he
shall speak in my name, I will require it of him, [Deu
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#019.md); for they well knew that this
word implied that Divine judgments should inevitably fall upon them. To
make proper way for this conclusion, Stephen enters into a detail of
their history, showing that, from the beginning, God had in view the
dispensation which was now opening, and that his designs were uniformly
opposed by their impious forefathers. That, notwithstanding all this,
God carried on his work:

First, by revealing his will to Abraham, and giving him the rite of
circumcision, which was to be preserved among his descendants.

Secondly, to Moses and Aaron in Egypt.

Thirdly, to the whole congregation of Israel at Mount Sinai, and
variously in the wilderness.

Fourthly, by instituting the tabernacle worship, which was completed in
the promised land, and continued till the days of Solomon, when the
temple was builded, and the worship of God became fixed.

Fifthly, by the long race of prophets raised up under that temple, who
had been all variously persecuted by their forefathers, who departed
from the true worship, and frequently became idolatrous; in consequence
of which God gave them up into the hands of their enemies, and they were
carried into captivity.

How far St. Stephen would have proceeded, or to what issue he would have
brought his discourse, we can only conjecture, as the fury of his
persecutors did not permit him to come to a conclusion. But this they
saw most clearly, that, from his statement, they could expect no mercy
at the hand of God, if they persisted in their opposition to Jesus of
Nazareth, and that their temple and political existence must fall a
sacrifice to their persevering obstinacy. Their guilt stung them to the
heart, and they were determined rather to vent their insupportable
feelings by hostile and murderous acts, than in penitential sorrow and
supplication for mercy. The issue was the martyrdom of Stephen; a man of
whom the sacred writings give the highest character, and a man who
illustrated that character in every part of his conduct. Stephen is
generally called the proto-martyr, i.e. the First martyr or witness, as
the word μαρτυρ implies; the person who, at the evident risk and
ultimate loss of his life, bears testimony to Truth. This honor,
however, may be fairly contested, and the palm at least divided between
him and John the Baptist. The martyrdom of Stephen, and the spirit in
which he suffered, have been an honor to the cause for which he
cheerfully gave up his life, for eighteen hundred years. While
Christianity endures, (and it will endure till time is swallowed up in
eternity), the martyrdom of Stephen will be the model, as it has been,
for all martyrs, and a cause of triumph to the Church of God.

3\. I cannot close these observations without making one remark on his
prayer for his murderers. Though this shows most forcibly the amiable,
forgiving spirit of the martyr, yet we must not forget that this, and
all the excellent qualities with which the mind of this blessed man was
endued, proceeded from that Holy Ghost of whose influences his mind was
full. The prayer therefore shows most powerfully the matchless
benevolence of God. Even these most unprincipled, most impious, and most
brutal of all murderers, were not out of the reach of His mercy! His
Spirit influenced the heart of this martyr to pray for his destroyers;
and could such prayers fail? No: Saul of Tarsus, in all probability was
the first fruits of them. St. Augustine has properly remarked, Si
Stephanus non orasset, ecclesia Paulum non haberet. If Stephen had not
prayed, the Church of Christ could not have numbered among her saints
the apostle of the Gentiles. Let this example teach us at once the
spirit that becomes a disciple of Christ, the efficacy of prayer, and
the unbounded philanthropy of God.
