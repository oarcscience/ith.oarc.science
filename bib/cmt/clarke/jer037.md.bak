### [Jeremiah Chapter 37](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 37:0</span></span>

Zedekiah succeeds Coniah, the son of Jehoiakim, in the Jewish throne,
and does that which is evil in the sight of the Lord, [Jer
37:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#001.md), [Jer
37:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#002.md). The king sends a message to
Jeremiah, [Jer 37:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#003.md). God suggests an
answer; and foretells the return of the Chaldean army, who should most
assuredly take and burn the city, [Jer
37:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#006.md). Jeremiah, in attempting to
leave this devoted city, and retire to his possession in the country, is
seized as a deserter, and cast into a dungeon, [Jer
37:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#011.md). The king, after a conference
with him, abates the rigour of his confinement, [Jer
37:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#016.md).

[Jeremiah 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 37:1</span></span>

And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah - Of the siege and taking of
Jerusalem referred to here, and the making of Zedekiah king instead of
Jeconiah, see [Kg2 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001) (note.md), etc.,
and the notes there.

[Jeremiah 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 37:3</span></span>

Zedekiah - to the prophet Jeremiah - He was willing to hear a message
from the Lord, provided it were according to his own mind. He did not
fully trust in his own prophets.

[Jeremiah 37:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 37:4</span></span>

Now Jeremiah came in and went out - After the siege was raised, he had a
measure of liberty; he was not closely confined, as he afterwards was.
See [Jer 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#016.md).

[Jeremiah 37:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 37:5</span></span>

Then Pharaoh's army - This was Pharaoh-hophra or Apries, who then
reigned in Egypt in place of his father Necho. See [Eze
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#006.md), etc. Nebuchadnezzar, hearing
that the Egyptian army, on which the Jews so much depended, was on their
march to relieve the city, suddenly raised the siege, and went to meet
them. In the interim Zedekiah sent to Jeremiah to inquire of the Lord to
know whether they might consider themselves in safety.

[Jeremiah 37:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 37:7</span></span>

Pharaoh's army - shall return to Egypt - They were defeated by the
Chaldeans; and, not being hearty in the cause, returned immediately to
Egypt, leaving Nebuchadnezzar unmolested to recommence the siege.

[Jeremiah 37:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 37:10</span></span>

For though ye had smitten the whole army - Strong words; but they show
how fully God was determined to give up this city to fire and sword, and
how fully he had instructed his prophet on this point.

[Jeremiah 37:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 37:12</span></span>

Jeremiah went forth - At the time that Nebuchadnezzar had raised the
siege, and gone to meet the Egyptian army.

Go into the land of Benjamin - To Anathoth, his native city.

To separate himself thence - "To receive a portion thereof among the
people;" - Blayney: who supposes that Jeremiah went to receive a portion
of the proceeds of his patrimony at Anathoth, which had, previously to
the siege, been in the hands of the Chaldeans. The siege being now
raised, he thought of looking thus after his own affairs. The Chaldee is
to the same sense. "He went that he might divide the inheritance which
he had there among the people." Dahler translates, 'He went to withdraw
himself from the siege, as many others of the inhabitants." I believe he
went to withdraw himself from a city devoted to destruction, and in
which he could no longer do any good.

[Jeremiah 37:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 37:13</span></span>

Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans - Thou art a deserter, and a traitor
to thy country. As he had always declared that the Chaldeans should take
the city, etc., his enemies took occasion from this to say he was in the
interest of the Chaldeans, and that he wished now to go to them, and
betray the place.

[Jeremiah 37:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 37:15</span></span>

And smote him - Without any proof of the alleged treachery, without any
form of justice.

In prison to the house of Jonathan - In Asiatic countries there is an
apartment in the houses of the officers of the law, to confine all the
accused that are brought before them. Jonathan was a scribe or
secretary, and had a prison of this kind in his house.

[Jeremiah 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 37:16</span></span>

Entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins - The dungeon was probably
a deep pit; and the cabins or cells, niches in the sides, where
different malefactors were confined. See Blayney.

[Jeremiah 37:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 37:17</span></span>

Is there any word from the Lord? - Is there any farther revelation?

There is: - thou shalt be delivered - What bold faithfulness! And to a
king, in whose hands his life now lay.

[Jeremiah 37:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 37:19</span></span>

Where are now your prophets - They told you that the Chaldeans should
not come; I told you they would. According to my word the Chaldeans are
come, and are departed only for a short time.

[Jeremiah 37:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 37:20</span></span>

Cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan - He had been ill used
in this man's custody, so as to endanger his life, the place being cold,
and probably unhealthy.

[Jeremiah 37:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 37:21</span></span>

Then Zedekiah - the court of the prison - Was contiguous to the king's
house, where the prisoners could readily see their friends.

Give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers' street - From the
public stores; which he received till all the provisions were spent.
