Preface to the Book of Exodus

The name by which this book is generally distinguished is borrowed from
the Septuagint, in which it is called εξοδος, Exodus, the going out or
departure; and by the Codex Alexandrinus, εξοδος αιγιπτου, the departure
from Egypt, because the departure of the Israelites from Egypt is the
most remarkable fact mentioned in the whole book. In the Hebrew Bibles
it is called ואלה שמות Ve-Elleh Shemoth, these are the names, which are
the words with which it commences. It contains a history of the
transactions of 145 years, beginning at the death of Joseph, where the
book of Genesis ends, and coming down to the erection of the tabernacle
in the wilderness at the foot of Mount Sinai.

In this book Moses details the causes and motives of the persecution
raised up against the Israelites in Egypt, the orders given by Pharaoh
to destroy all the Hebrew male children, and the prevention of the
execution of those orders through the humanity and piety of the midwives
appointed to deliver the Hebrew women. The marriage of Amram and
Jochebed is next related; the birth of Moses; the manner in which he was
exposed on the river Nile, and in which he was discovered by the
daughter of Pharaoh; his being providentially put under the care of his
own mother to be nursed, and educated as the son of the Egyptian
princess; how, when forty years of age, he left the court, visited and
defended his brethren; the danger to which he was in consequence
exposed; his flight to Arabia; his contract with Jethro, priest or
prince of Midian, whose daughter Zipporah he afterwards espoused. While
employed in keeping the flocks of his father-in-law, God appeared to him
in a burning bush, and commissioned him to go and deliver his countrymen
from the oppression under which they groaned. Having given him the most
positive assurances of protection and power to work miracles, and having
associated with him his brother Aaron, he sent them first to the
Israelites to declare the purpose of Jehovah, and afterwards to Pharaoh
to require him, in the name of the Most High, to set the Israelites at
liberty. Pharaoh, far from submitting, made their yoke more grievous;
and Moses, on a second interview with him, to convince him by whose
authority he made the demand, wrought a miracle before him and his
courtiers. This being in a certain way imitated by Pharaoh's magicians,
he hardened his heart, and refused to let the people go, till God, by
ten extraordinary plagues, convinced him of his omnipotence, and obliged
him to consent to dismiss a people over whose persons and properties he
had claimed and exercised a right founded only on the most tyrannical
principles.

The plagues by which God afflicted the whole land of Egypt, Goshen
excepted, where the Israelites dwelt, were the following: -

1\. He turned all the waters of Egypt into blood.

2\. He caused innumerable frogs to come over the whole land.

3\. He afflicted both man and beast with immense swarms of vermin.

4\. Afterwards with a multitude of different kinds of insects.

5\. He sent a grievous pestilence among their cattle.

6\. Smote both man and beast with boils.

7\. Destroyed their crops with grievous storms of hail, accompanied with
the most terrible thunder and lightning.

8\. Desolated the whole land by innumerable swarms of locusts.

9\. He spread a palpable darkness all over Egypt; and,

10\. In one night slew all the first-born, both of man and beast,
through the whole of the Egyptian territories.

What proved the miraculous nature of all these plagues most particularly
was, 1st, Their coming exactly according to the prediction and at the
command of Moses and Aaron. 2dly, Their extending only to the Egyptians,
and leaving the land of Goshen, the Israelites, their cattle and
substance, entirely untouched. After relating all these things in
detail, with their attendant circumstances, Moses describes the
institution, reason, and celebration of the passover; the preparation of
the Israelites for their departure; their leaving Goshen and beginning
their journey to the promised land, by the way of Rameses, Succoth, and
Etham. How Pharaoh, repenting of the permission he had given them to
depart, began to pursue them with an immense army of horse and foot, and
overtook them at their encampment at Baal-zephon, on the borders of the
Red Sea. Their destruction appearing then to be inevitable, Moses
farther relates that having called earnestly upon God, and stretched his
rod over the waters, they became divided, and the Israelites entered
into the bed of the sea, and passed over to the opposite shore. Pharaoh
and his host madly pursuing in the same track, the rear of their army
being fairly entered by the time the last of the Israelites had made
good their landing on the opposite coast. Moses stretching his rod again
over the waters, they returned to their former channel and overwhelmed
the Egyptian army, so that every soul perished.

Moses next gives a circumstantial account of the different encampments
of the Israelites in the wilderness, during the space of nearly forty
years: the miracles wrought in their behalf; the chief of which were the
pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, to direct and
protect them in the wilderness; the bringing water out of a rock for
them and their cattle; feeding them with manna from heaven; bringing
innumerable flocks of quails to their camp; giving them a complete
victory over the Amalekites at the intercession of Moses; and
particularly God's astonishing manifestation of himself on Mount Sinai,
when he delivered to Moses an epitome of his whole law, in what was
called the Ten Words or Ten Commandments.

Moses proceeds to give a circumstantial detail of the different laws,
statutes, and ordinances which he received from God, and particularly
the giving of the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai, and the awful display
of the Divine Majesty on that solemn occasion; the formation of the Ark,
holy Table and Candlestick; the Tabernacle, with its furniture,
covering, courts, etc., the brazen Altar, golden Altar, brazen Laver,
anointing oil, perfume, sacerdotal garments for Aaron and his sons, and
the artificers employed on the work of the Tabernacle, etc. He then
gives an account of Israel's idolatry in the matter of the golden calf,
made under the direction of Aaron; God's displeasure, and the death of
the principal idolaters; the erection and consecration of the
Tabernacle, and its being filled and encompassed with the Divine glory,
with the order and manner of their marches by direction of the
miraculous pillar; with which the book concludes.
