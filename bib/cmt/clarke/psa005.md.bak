### [Psalms Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 5:0</span></span>

David continues instant in prayers [Psa
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#001.md), [Psa
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#002.md); makes early application to God,
[Psa 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#003.md); and shows the hatred which
God bears to the workers of iniquity, [Psa
5:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#004.md). His determination to worship
God, and to implore direction and support, [Psa
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#007.md), [Psa
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#008.md). He points out the wickedness of
his enemies, [Psa 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#009.md), and the
destruction they may expect, [Psa
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#010.md); and then shows the happiness of
those who trust in the Lord, [Psa
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#011.md), [Psa
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#012.md).

This Psalm is inscribed to the chief Musician upon Nehiloth, A Psalm of
David. As neginoth may signify all kinds of instruments struck with a
plectrum, stringed instruments, those like the drum, cymbals, etc.; so
nechiloth, from חל chal, to be hollow, to bore through, may signify any
kind of wind instruments, such as the horn, trumpet, flute, etc. See on
[Psa 4:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001) (note.md). The Septuagint
have, Εις το τελος, ὑπερ της κληρονομουσης, "In favor of her who obtains
the inheritance." The Vulgate and Arabic have a similar reading. The
word נחילות nechiloth they have derived from נחל nachal, to inherit.
This may either refer to the Israelites who obtained the inheritance of
the promised land, or to the Church of Christ which obtains through him,
by faith and prayer, the inheritance among the saints in light. This
Psalm is, especially, for the whole Church of God.

[Psalms 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 5:1</span></span>

Give ear to my words - This is properly a morning hymn, as the preceding
was an evening hymn. We have seen from the conclusion of the last Psalm
that David was very happy, and lay down and slept in the peace and love
of his God. When he opens his eyes on the following morning, he not only
remembers but feels the happiness of which he spoke; and with his first
recollections he meditates on the goodness and mercy of God, and the
glorious state of salvation into which he had been brought. He calls on
God to give ear to his words; probably words of God's promises which he
had been pleading.

[Psalms 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 5:2</span></span>

Hearken unto the voice of my cry - We may easily find the process
through which David's mind was now passing:

1\. We have seen from the preceding Psalm that he lay down in a very
happy frame of mind, and that he had enjoyed profound repose.

2\. As soon as he awakes in the morning, his heart, having a right
direction, resumes its work.

3\. He meditates on God's goodness; and on his own happy state, though
pursued by enemies, and only safe as long as God preserved him by an
almighty hand and especial providence.

4\. This shows him the need he has of the continual protection of the
Most High; and therefore he begins to form his meditation and the
desires of his heart into words, to which he entreats the Lord to give
ear.

5\. As he was accustomed to have answers to his prayers, he feels the
necessity of being importunate! and therefore lifts up his voice.

6\. Seeing the workers of iniquity, liars, and blood-thirsty men strong
to accomplish their own purposes in the destruction of the godly, he
becomes greatly in earnest, and cries unto the Lord: "Hearken unto the
voice of my cry."

7\. He knows that, in order to have a right answer, he must have a
proper disposition of mind. He feels his subjection to the supreme
authority of the Most High, and is ready to do his will and obey his
laws; therefore he prays to God as his lying: "Hearken, my King and my
God." I have not only taken thee for my God, to save, defend, and make
me happy; but I have taken thee for my King, to govern, direct, and rule
over me.

8\. Knowing the necessity and success of prayer, he purposes to continue
in the spirit and practice of it: "Unto thee will I pray." R. S. Jarchi
gives this a pretty and pious turn: "When I have power to pray, and to
ask for the things I need, then, O Lord, give ear to my words; but when
I have no power to plead with thee, and fear seizes on my heart, then, O
Lord, consider my meditation!"

[Psalms 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 5:3</span></span>

My voice shalt thou hear in the morning - We find from this that he had
not prayed in vain. He had received a blessed answer; God had lifted
upon him the light of his countenance, and he therefore determines to be
an early applicant at the throne of grace: "My voice shalt thou hear in
the morning." He finds it good to begin the day with God; to let Divine
things occupy the first place in his waking thoughts; as that which
first occupies the mind on awaking is most likely to keep possession of
the heart all the day through.

In the morning will I direct my prayer - Here seems to be a metaphor
taken from an archer. He sees his mark; puts his arrow in his bow;
directs his shaft to the mark, i.e., takes his aim; lets fly, and then
looks up, to see if he have hit his mark. Prayers that have a right aim,
will have a prompt answer; and he who sends up his petitions to God
through Christ, from a warm, affectionate heart, may confidently look up
for an answer, for it will come. If an immediate answer be not given,
let not the upright heart suppose that the prayer is not heard. It has
found its way to the throne; and there it is registered.

[Psalms 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 5:4</span></span>

Neither shall evil dwell with thee - As thou art holy, so thou hast
pleasure only in holiness; and as to evil men, they shall never enter
into thy glory; לא יגרך רע lo yegurecha ra, "the evil man shall not even
sojourn with thee."

[Psalms 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 5:5</span></span>

The foolish shall not stand - He is a fool and a madman who is running
himself out of breath for no prize, who is fighting against the
Almighty; this every wicked man does; therefore is every wicked man a
fool and a madman.

Thou hatest all workers of iniquity - Some sin now and then, others
generally; some constantly, and some labor in it with all their might.
These are the Workers of iniquity. Such even the God of infinite love
and mercy hates. Alas! what a portion have the workers of iniquity! the
hatred of God Almighty!

[Psalms 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 5:6</span></span>

That speak leasing - Falsity, from the Anglo-Saxon leasunge, a lie,
falsity, deceit; from leas, lie, which is from the verb leasian to lie.
See on [Psa 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#002) (note.md).

The Lord will abhor the bloody and deceitful man - איש דמים ish damim,
the man of bloods; for he who has the spirit of a murderer, will rarely
end with one bloodshedding. So the Jews, who clamored for the blood of
our Lord, added to that, as far and as long as they could, the blood of
his disciples.

[Psalms 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 5:7</span></span>

In the multitude of thy mercy - David considered it an inexpressible
privilege to be permitted to attend public worship; and he knew that it
was only through the multitude of God's mercy that he, or any man else,
could enjoy such a privilege. He knew farther that, from the multitude
of this mercy, he might receive innumerable blessings in his house. In
this spirit, and with this dependence, he went to the house of the Lord.
He who takes David's views of this subject will never, willingly, be
absent from the means of grace.

In thy fear - Duly considering the infinite holiness of thy majesty,
will I worship, אשתחוה eshtachaveh, will I bow and prostrate myself in
the deepest self-abasement and humility.

Toward thy holy temple - If David was the author of this Psalm, as is
generally agreed, the temple was not built at this time: only the
tabernacle then existed; and in the preceding clause he speaks of coming
into the house, by which he must mean the tabernacle. But temple here
may signify the holy of holies, before which David might prostrate
himself while in the house, i.e., the court of the tabernacle. Even in
the house of God, there is the temple of God; the place where the Divine
Shechinah dwells. God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself. In
him dwelt all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. In all ages and
dispensations, Jesus was ever the temple where the Supreme Deity was met
with and worshipped. The human nature of Jesus was the real temple of
the Deity. Nowhere else can God be found.

[Psalms 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 5:8</span></span>

Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness - When entered into the house, and
prostrated before the temple, he knew that, unless God continued to lead
and direct, he was not likely to profit even by such great advantages.
We need God not only to bring us to his house, but to keep our feet
while we are there.

Because of mine enemies - His conduct was marked; his enemies looked
upon and watched him with an evil eye. They would have been glad of his
halting, that they might have brought a reproach on the good cause which
he had espoused. O how cautiously should those walk who make a
profession of living to God, of knowing themselves to be in his favor,
and of being delivered from all sin in this life!

Make thy way straight - Show me that I must go right on; and let thy
light always shine on my path, that I may see how to proceed.

[Psalms 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 5:9</span></span>

No faithfulness in their mouth - They make professions of friendship;
but all is hollow and deceitful: "They flatter with their tongue."

Very wickedness - Their heart is full of all kinds of depravity.

Their throat is an open sepulcher - It is continually gaping for the
dead; and sends forth effluvia destructive to the living. I fear that
this is too true a picture of the whole human race, totally corrupt
within, and abominable without. The heart is the center and spring of
this corruption; and the words and actions of men, which proceed from
this source, will send out incessant streams of various impurity; and
thus they continue till the grace of God changes and purifies the heart.

[Psalms 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 5:10</span></span>

Destroy thou them, O God - All these apparently imprecatory declarations
should be translated in the future tense, to which they belong; and
which shows them to be prophetic. Thou Wilt destroy them; thou Wilt cast
them out, etc.

[Psalms 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 5:11</span></span>

Let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice - Such expressions as
these should be translated in the same way, declaratively and
prophetically: "All those who put their trust in thee Shall rejoice, -
Shall ever shout for joy."

[Psalms 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 5:12</span></span>

For thou, Lord, wilt bless the righteous - A righteous soul is a
peculiar object of God's affectionate regards; and therefore will be a
subject of continual blessing.

With favor - Literally, Like a shield, thy favor will crown him. God
loves such; and this love is their defense. In all places, times and
circumstances, it will preserve them. "Keep yourselves," says the
apostle, "in the love of God." He who abides in this love need not fear
the face of any adversary. Thus ended the morning's devotion of this
excellent man: a model by which every Christian may frame his own.
