[Exodus 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 31:2</span></span>

I have called by name Bezaleel - That is, I have particularly appointed
this person to be the chief superintendent of the whole work. His name
is significant, בצלאל betsal-el, in or under the shadow of God, meaning,
under the especial protection of the Most High. He was the son of Uri,
the son of Hur, the son of Caleb or Chelubai, the son of Esron, the son
of Pharez, the son of Judah. See [Ch1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#005.md), [Ch1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#009.md),[Ch1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#018.md), [Ch1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#019.md), [Ch1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#020.md), and see Clarke's note on [Exo
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#010.md).

[Exodus 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 31:3</span></span>

I have filled him with the spirit of God - See Clarke's note on [Exo
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#003.md).

In wisdom - חכמה, chochmah, from חכם chacham, to be wise, skillful, or
prudent, denoting the compass of mind and strength of capacity necessary
to form a wise man: hence our word wisdom, the power of judging what is
wise or best to be done; from the Saxon, to teach, to advise, and to
judge; hence the doom or judgment of the well taught, wise, or prudent
man.

Understanding - תבונה tebunah, from בן ban or bun, to separate,
distinguish, discern; capacity to comprehend the different parts of a
work, how to connect, arrange, etc., in order to make a complete whole.

Knowledge - דעת daath, denoting particular acquaintance with a person or
thing; practical, experimental knowledge.

[Exodus 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 31:4</span></span>

Cunning works - מחשבת machashaboth, works of invention or genius, in the
goldsmith and silversmith line.

[Exodus 31:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 31:5</span></span>

In cutting of stones, etc. - Every thing that concerned the lapidary's,
jeweler's, and carver's art.

[Exodus 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 31:6</span></span>

In the hearts of all that are wisehearted I have put wisdom - So every
man that had a natural genius, as we term it, had an increase of wisdom
by immediate inspiration from God, so that he knew how to execute the
different works which Divine wisdom designed for the tabernacle and its
furniture. Dark as were the heathens, yet they acknowledged that all
talents, and the seeds of all arts, came from God. Hence Seneca: Insita
nobis omnium artium semina, magisterque ex occulto Deus producit
ingenia. In the same way Homer attributes such curious arts to Minerva,
the goddess of wisdom, and Vulcan, the god of handicrafts.

Ὡς δ' ὁτε τις χρυσον περιχευεται αργυρῳ ανηρ

Ιδρις, ὁν Ἡφαιστος δεδαεν και Παλλας Αθηνη

Τεχνην παντοιην, χαριεντα δε εργα τελειει.

Odyss., 1. vi., ver. 232.

As by some artist, to whom Vulcan gives

His skill divine, a breathing statue lives;

By Pallas taught, he frames the wondrous mould,

And o'er the silver pours the fusile gold.

\- Pope.

And all this the wisest of men long before them declared; when speaking
of the wisdom of God he says, I, Wisdom, dwell with Prudence, and find
out knowledge of witty inventions; [Pro
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#012.md). See Clarke's note on [Exo
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#003.md), to which the reader is
particularly desired to refer. There is something remarkable in the name
of this second superintendent, אהליאב Aholiab, the tabernacle of the
father, or, the father is my tabernacle; a name nearly similar in its
meaning to that of Bezaleel, see Clarke's note on [Exo
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#002.md).

[Exodus 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 31:8</span></span>

The pure candlestick - Called so either because of the pure gold of
which it was made, or the brightness and splendor of its workmanship, or
of the light which it imparted in the tabernacle, as the purest, finest
oil was always burnt in it.

[Exodus 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 31:9</span></span>

The altar of burnt-offering - See Clarke's note on [Exo
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#001.md).

The laver and his foot - The pedestal on which it stood.

[Exodus 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 31:10</span></span>

Clothes of service - Vestments for the ordinary work of their ministry;
the holy garments - those which were peculiar to the high priest.

[Exodus 31:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 31:11</span></span>

The anointing oil - See Clarke's note on [Exo
30:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#023.md).

Sweet incense - See on [Exo 30:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#024.md)
(note).

[Exodus 31:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">exo 31:13</span></span>

My Sabbaths ye shall keep - See Clarke's note on [Gen
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#003.md). See Clarke's note on [Exo
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#008.md).

[Exodus 31:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 31:14</span></span>

Every one that defileth it - By any kind of idolatrous or profane
worship.

Shall surely be put to death - The magistrates shall examine into the
business, and if the accused be found guilty, he shall be stoned to
death.

Shall be cut off - Because that person who could so far contemn the
Sabbath, which was a sign to them of the rest which remained for the
people of God, was of course an infidel, and should be cut off from all
the privileges and expectations of an Israelite.

[Exodus 31:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">exo 31:16</span></span>

A perpetual covenant - Because it is a sign of this future rest and
blessedness, therefore the religious observance of it must be
perpetually kept up. The type must continue in force till the antitype
come.

[Exodus 31:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 31:17</span></span>

Rested, and was refreshed - God, in condescension to human weakness,
applies to himself here what belongs to man. If a man religiously rests
on the Sabbath, both his body and soul shall be refreshed; he shall
acquire new light and life.

[Exodus 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 31:18</span></span>

When he had made an end of communing - When the forty days and forty
nights were ended.

Two tables of testimony - See Clarke's note on [Exo
34:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#001.md). Tables of stone - That the
record might be lasting, because it was a testimony that referred to
future generations, and therefore the materials should be durable.

Written with the finger of God - All the letters cut by God himself. Dr.
Winder, in his History of Knowledge, thinks it probable that this was
the first writing in alphabetical characters ever exhibited to the
world, though there might have been marks or hieroglyphics cut on wood,
stone, etc., before this time; see [Exo
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#014.md). That these tables were written,
not by the commandment but by the power of God himself, the following
passages seem to prove: "And the Lord said unto Moses, Come up to me
into the mountain, and be thou there; and I will give thee tables of
stone Which I Have Written, that thou mayest teach them;" [Exo
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#012.md). "And he gave unto Moses, upon
Mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, Written With The
Finger Of God;" [Exo 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#018.md). "And Moses
went down from the mount, and the two tables of testimony were in his
hand; the tables were Written on both their sides. And the tables were
The Work Of God, and the Writing Was The Writing Of God, graven upon the
tables;" [Exo 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#015.md), [Exo
32:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#016.md). "These words \[the ten
commandments\] the Lord spake in the mount, out of the midst of the
fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice; and
he added no more, But He Wrote Them on two tables of stone;" [Deu
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#022.md). It is evident therefore that
this writing was properly and literally the writing of God himself. God
wrote now on tables of stone what he had originally written on the heart
of man, and in mercy he placed that before his eyes which by sin had
been obliterated from his soul; and by this he shows us what, by the
Spirit of Christ, must be rewritten in the mind, [Co2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#003.md); and this is according to the
covenant which God long before promised to make with mankind, [Jer
31:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#033.md). See also what is said on this
subject, [Exo 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#001) (note.md), [Exo
34:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#001) (note.md), and [Exo
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#014) (note.md).

"No time," says Dr. A. Bayley, "seems so proper from whence to date the
introduction of letters among the Hebrews as this, for after this period
we find continual mention of letters, reading, and writing, in the now
proper sense of those words. See [Deu
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#008.md); [Deu
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#009.md). Moses, it is said, επαιδευθη,
was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians - in all the learning
they possessed; but it is manifest that he had not learned of them any
method of writing, otherwise there had been no want of God's act and
assistance in writing the two tables of the law, no need of a miraculous
writing. Had Moses known this art, the Lord might have said to him, as
he does often afterwards, Write thou these words; [Exo
34:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#027.md). Write on the stones the words
of this law; [Deu 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#003.md). Write you this
song for you; [Deu 31:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#019.md). Perhaps it
may be said, God's writing the law gave it a sanction. True; but why
might it not also teach the first use of letters, unless it can be
proved that they were in use prior to this transaction? It might be
thought too much to assert that letters no more than language were a
natural discovery; that it was impossible for man to have invented
writing, and that he did not invent it: yet this may appear really the
case from the following reflections: -

1\. Reason may show us how near to an impossibility it was that a just
and proper number of convenient characters for the sounds in language
should naturally be hit upon by any man, for whom it was easy to imitate
and vary, but not to invent.

2\. From evidence of the Mosaic history, it appears that the
introduction of writing among the Hebrews was not from man, but God.

3\. There are no evident vestiges of letters subsisting among other
nations till after the delivery of the law at Mount Sinai; nor then,
among some, till very late."
