### [Nahum Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#001.md)

This chapter opens the prophecy against the Assyrians and their
metropolis with a very magnificent description of the infinite justice,
tender compassion, and uncontrollable power of God, [Nah
1:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#001.md). To this succeeds an address to
the Assyrians; with a lively picture of their sudden overthrow, because
of their evil device against Jerusalem, [Nah
1:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#009.md). Then appears Jehovah himself,
proclaiming deliverance to his people from the Assyrian yoke, and the
destruction of the Assyrian idols, [Nah
1:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#012.md); upon which the prophet, with
great emphasis, directs the attention of Judah to the approach of the
messenger who brings such glad tidings; and exultingly bids his people
to celebrate their solemn feasts, and perform their vows, as a merciful
Providence would not suffer these enemies of the Jewish state to prevail
against them, [Nah 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#015.md).

[Nahum 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">nah 1:1</span></span>

The burden of Nineveh - משא massa not only signifies a burden, but also
a thing lifted up, pronounced, or proclaimed; also a message. It is used
by the prophets to signify the revelation which they have received from
God to deliver to any particular people: the oracle - the prophecy. Here
it signifies the declaration from God relative to the overthrow of
Nineveh, and the commission of the prophet to deliver it.

As the Assyrians under Pul, Tiglath-pileser, and Shalmaneser, three of
their kinds, had been employed by a just God for the chastisement of his
disobedient people; the end being now accomplished by them, God is about
to burn the rod wherewith he corrected Israel; and Nineveh, the capital
of the Assyrian empire, is to be destroyed. This prediction appears to
have been accomplished a short time after this by Nebuchadnezzar and
Cyaxares, the Ahasuerus of Scripture.

Nahum, נחום Nachum, signifies comforter. The name was very suitable, as
he was sent to comfort the people, by showing them that God was about to
destroy their adversaries.

[Nahum 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">nah 1:2</span></span>

God is jealous - For his own glory.

And - revengeth - His justice; by the destruction of his enemies.

And is furious - So powerful in the manifestations of his judgments,
that nothing can stand before him.

He reserveth wrath - Though they seem to prosper for a time, and God
appears to have passed by their crimes without notice, yet he reserveth
- treasureth up - wrath for them, which shall burst forth in due time.

[Nahum 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">nah 1:3</span></span>

The Lord is slow to anger - He exercises much longsuffering towards his
enemies, that this may lead them to repentance. And it is because of
this longsuffering that vengeance is not speedily executed on every evil
work.

Great in power - Able at all times to save or to destroy.

The Lord hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm - These are the
effects of his power; and when they appear unusual, they may be
considered as the immediate effects of his power: and although he be in
them to punish and destroy, he is in them to direct their course, to
determine their operations, and to defend his followers from being
injured by their violence. The pestilential wind which slew one hundred
and eighty-five thousand of the Assyrians did not injure one Israelite.
See [Kg2 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035.md).

The clouds are the dust of his feet - This is spoken in allusion to a
chariot and horses going on with extreme rapidity: they are all
enveloped in a cloud of dust. So Jehovah is represented as coming
through the circuit of the heavens as rapidly as lightning; the clouds
surrounding him as the dust does the chariot and horses.

[Nahum 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">nah 1:4</span></span>

He rebuketh the sea - The Red Sea and the rivers: probably an allusion
to the passage of the Red Sea and Jordan.

The description of the coming of Jehovah, from the third to the sixth
verse, is dreadfully majestic. He is represented as controlling
universal nature. The sea and the rivers are dried up, the mountains
tremble, the hills melt, and the earth is burnt at his presence. Bashan,
Carmel, and Lebanon are withered and languish: streams of fire are
poured out, and the rocks are cast down to make him a passage. If then,
the seas, the rivers, the mountains, the hills, the rocks, and the earth
itself, fail before Jehovah, or flee from his presence, how shall
Nineveh and the Assyrian empire stand before him?

[Nahum 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">nah 1:7</span></span>

The Lord is good - In the midst of judgment he remembers mercy; and
among the most dreadful denunciations of wrath he mingles promises of
mercy. None that trust in him need be alarmed at these dreadful
threatenings; they shall be discriminated in the day of wrath, for the
Lord knoweth them that trust in him.

[Nahum 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">nah 1:8</span></span>

But with an overrunning flood - Bishop Newcome thinks this may refer to
the manner in which Nineveh was taken. The Euphrates overflowed its
banks, deluged a part of the city, and overturned twenty stadia of the
wall; in consequence of which the desponding king burnt himself, and his
palace, with his treasures. - Diodor. Sic., Edit. Wessel., p. 140, lib.
ii., s. 27.

Darkness shall pursue - Calamity. All kinds of calamity shall pursue
them till they are destroyed.

[Nahum 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">nah 1:9</span></span>

Affliction shall not rise up the second time - There shall be no need to
repeat the judgment; with one blow God will make a full end of the
business.

[Nahum 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">nah 1:10</span></span>

While they be folden together - However united their counsels may be,
they shall be as drunken men - perplexed and unsteady in all their
resolutions; and before God's judgments they shall be as dry thorns
before a devouring fire.

[Nahum 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">nah 1:11</span></span>

Imagineth evil against the Lord - Such were Pul, [Kg2
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#010.md), Tiglath-pileser, [Kg2
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029.md); Shalmaneser, [Kg2
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006.md); and Sennacherib, [Kg2
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#017.md); [Kg2
19:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#023.md).

A wicked counsellor - Sennacherib and Rabshakeh.

[Nahum 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">nah 1:12</span></span>

Though they be - many - Sennacherib invaded Judea with an army of nearly
two hundred thousand men.

Thus shall they be cut down - The angel of the Lord (a suffocating wind)
slew of them in one night one hundred and eighty-five thousand [Kg2
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035.md).

[Nahum 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">nah 1:13</span></span>

Now will I break his yoke from off thee - This refers to the tribute
which the Jews were obliged to pay to the Assyrians, [Kg2
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#014.md).

[Nahum 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">nah 1:14</span></span>

No more of thy name be sown - No more of you shall be carried away into
captivity.

I will make thy grave; for thou art vile - I think this is an address to
the Assyrians, and especially to Sennacherib. The text is no obscure
intimation of the fact. The house of his gods is to be his grave: and we
know that while he was worshipping in the house of his god Nisroch, his
two sons, Adrammelech and Sharezer, smote him there that he died, [Kg2
19:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#037.md).

[Nahum 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">nah 1:15</span></span>

Behold upon the mountains - Borrowed probably from [Isa
52:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007.md), but applied here to the
messengers who brought the good tidings of the destruction of Nineveh.
Judah might then keep her solemn feasts, for the wicked Assyrian should
pass through the land no more; being entirely cut off, and the imperial
city razed to its foundations.
