### [Leviticus Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lev 25:0</span></span>

The law concerning the Sabbatical or seventh year repeated, [Lev
25:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#001.md). The law relative to the
jubilee, or fiftieth year, and the hallowing of the fiftieth, [Lev
25:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#008.md). In the year of jubilee every
one to return unto his possessions, [Lev
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#013.md). None to oppress another in
buying and selling, [Lev 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#014.md).
Purchases to be rated from jubilee to jubilee, according to the number
of years unexpired, [Lev 25:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#015.md).
Promises to obedience, [Lev 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#018.md),
[Lev 25:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#019.md). Promises relative to the
Sabbatical year, [Lev 25:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#020.md). No
inheritance must be finally alienated, [Lev
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#023.md), [Lev
25:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#024.md). No advantage to be taken of a
man's poverty in buying his land, [Lev
25:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#025.md). Ordinances relative to the
selling of a house in a walled city, [Lev
25:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#029.md), [Lev
25:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#030.md); in a village, [Lev
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#031.md). Houses of the Levites may be
redeemed at any time, [Lev 25:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#032.md), [Lev
25:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#033.md). The fields of the Levites in
the suburbs must not be sold, [Lev
25:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#034.md). No usury to be taken from a
poor brother, [Lev 25:35-38](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#035.md). If an
Israelite be sold to an Israelite, he must not be obliged to serve as a
slave, [Lev 25:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#039.md), but be as a hired
servant or as a sojourner, till the year of jubilee, [Lev
25:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#040.md), when he and his family shall
have liberty to depart, [Lev 25:41](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#041.md);
because God claims all Israelites as his servants, having redeemed them
from bondage in Egypt, [Lev 25:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#042.md),
[Lev 25:43](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#043.md). The Israelites are
permitted to have bond-men and bond-women of the heathens, who, being
bought with their money, shall be considered as their property, [Lev
25:44-46](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#044.md). If an Israelite, grown poor,
be sold to a sojourner who has waxed rich, he may be redeemed by one of
his relatives, an uncle or uncle's son, [Lev
25:47-49](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#047.md). In the interim between the
jubilees, he may be redeemed; but if not redeemed, he shall go free in
the jubilee, [Lev 25:50-54](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#050.md). Obedience
enforced by God's right over them as his servants, [Lev
25:55](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#055.md).

[Leviticus 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 25:2</span></span>

The land keep a Sabbath - See this ordinance explained, [Exo
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#011) (note.md). It may be asked here: if
it required all the annual produce of the field to support the
inhabitants, how could the people be nourished the seventh year, when no
produce was received from the fields? To this it may be answered, that
God sent his blessing in an especial manner on the sixth year, (see [Lev
25:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#021.md), [Lev
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#022).md), and it brought forth fruit for
three years. How astonishing and convincing was this miracle! Could
there possibly be any deception here? No! The miracle speaks for itself,
proves the Divine authenticity of the law, and takes every prop and stay
from the system that wishes to convict the Mosaic ordinances of
imposture. See [Exo 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#011.md). It is
evident from this that the Mosaic law must have had a Divine origin, as
no man in his senses, without God's authority, could have made such an
ordinance as this; for the sixth year, from its promulgation, would have
amply refuted his pretensions to a Divine mission.

[Leviticus 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lev 25:8</span></span>

Thou shalt number seven Sabbaths of years - This seems to state that the
jubilee was to be celebrated on the forty-ninth year; but in [Lev
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#010.md) and [Lev
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#011.md) it is said, Ye shall hallow the
fiftieth year, and, A jubilee shall this fiftieth year be. Probably in
this verse Moses either includes the preceding jubilee, and thus with
the forty-ninth makes up the number fifty; or he speaks of proclaiming
the jubilee on the forty-ninth, and celebrating it on the fiftieth year
current. Some think it was celebrated on the forty-ninth year, as is
stated in [Lev 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#008.md); and this
prevented the Sabbatical year, or seventh year of rest, from being
confounded with the jubilee, which it must otherwise have been, had the
celebration of this great solemnity taken place on the fiftieth year;
but it is most likely that the fiftieth was the real jubilee.

[Leviticus 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lev 25:11</span></span>

A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be - The literal meaning of the word
jubilee, יובל yobel in Hebrew, and יוביל yobil in the Samaritan, has not
been well ascertained. Josephus and the rabbins have caused many to err;
the former says the word signifies liberty; Ελευθεριαν δε σημαινει
τουνομα, Antiq., l. 3, cap. 12, edit. Haverc., vol. 1, p. 184; but the
word liberty signifies rather the intention of the institution, than the
meaning of the Hebrew term. The rabbins say it signifies a ram's horn,
because the trumpets which were used in proclaiming this solemnity were
made out of ram's horns. This meaning is adopted in a few places in our
translation, but none of the ancient versions acknowledge this sense of
the term, the Chaldee excepted. Some derive it from יבל yabal, to bring,
carry away, because the Israelites at this time carried away the right
of repossessing their inheritances which had been forfeited or
alienated. The most natural derivation is from הוביל hobil, to cause to
bring back, or recall, because estates, etc., which had been alienated,
were then brought back to their primitive owners. This was a wise and
excellent institution, but appears to have been little regarded by the
Jews after the Babylonish captivity. Indeed, it is not mentioned under
the second temple, and the observance must have ceased among the Jews
when they were brought under a foreign yoke. The jubilee seems to have
been typical,

1\. Of the great time of release, the Gospel dispensation, when all who
believe in Christ Jesus are redeemed from the bondage of sin - repossess
the favor and image of God, the only inheritance of the human soul,
having all debts cancelled, and the right of inheritance restored. To
this the prophet Isaiah seems to allude, [Isa
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#013.md), and particularly [Isa
61:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md).

2\. Of the general resurrection. "It is," says Mr. Parkhurst, "a lively
prefiguration of the grand consummation of time, which will be
introduced in like manner by the trump of God, [Co1
15:52](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#052.md), when the children and heirs of
God shall be delivered from all their forfeitures, and restored to the
eternal inheritance allotted to them by their Father; and thenceforth
rest from their labors, and be supported in life and happiness by what
the field of God shall supply."

It is worthy of remark that the jubilee was not proclaimed till the
tenth day of the seventh month, on the very day when the great annual
atonement was made for the sins of the people; and does not this prove
that the great liberty or redemption from thraldom, published under the
Gospel, could not take place till the great Atonement, the sacrifice of
the Lord Jesus, had been offered up? See [Lev
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#009.md).

[Leviticus 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 25:14</span></span>

Ye shall not oppress one another - Ye shall take no advantage of each
other's ignorance either in buying or selling; for he that buys an
article at less than it is worth, or sells one for more than it is
worth, taking advantage in both cases of the ignorance of the vender or
buyer, is no better than a thief, as he actually robs his neighbor of as
much property as he has bought the article at below or sold it above its
current value.

[Leviticus 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lev 25:15</span></span>

According to the number of years - The purchases that were to be made of
lands were to be regulated by the number of years unelapsed of the
current jubilee. This was something like buying the unexpired term of a
lease among us; the purchase is always regulated by the number of years
between the time of purchase and the expiration of the term.

[Leviticus 25:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lev 25:20</span></span>

What shall we eat the seventh year? - A very natural question, which
could only be laid at rest by the sovereign promise in the next verse:

I will Command my Blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall
bring forth fruit for Three Years. See on [Lev
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#002) (note.md).

[Leviticus 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">lev 25:23</span></span>

The land shall not be sold for ever - the land is mine - As God in a
miraculous manner gave them possession of this land, they were therefore
to consider themselves merely as tenants to him; and on this ground he,
as the great landholder or lord of the soil, prescribes to them all the
conditions on which they shall hold it. This one circumstance was
peculiarly favorable to their advancement in religion, in righteousness,
and true holiness; for feeling that they had nothing which they could
call their own upon earth, they must frequently, by this, be put in mind
of the necessity of having a permanent dwelling in the heavenly
inheritance, and of that preparation without which it could not be
possessed.

[Leviticus 25:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">lev 25:25</span></span>

Any of his kin come to redeem it - The land that was sold might be
redeemed, in the interim between jubilee and jubilee, by the former
owner or by one of his kinsmen or relatives. This kinsman is called in
the text גאל goel or redeemer; and was not this a lively emblem of the
redemption of man by Christ Jesus? That he might have a right to redeem
man, he took upon him human nature, and thus became a kinsman of the
great family of the human race, and thereby possessed the right of
redeeming that fallen nature of which he took part, and of buying back
to man that inheritance which had been forfeited by transgression.

[Leviticus 25:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">lev 25:29</span></span>

Sell a dwelling house in a walled city - A very proper difference is put
between houses in a city and houses in the country. If a man sold his
house in the city, he might redeem it any time in the course of a year;
but if it were not redeemed within that time, it could no more be
redeemed, nor did it go out even in the jubilee. It was not so with a
house in the country; such a house might be redeemed during any part of
the interim; and if not redeemed, must go out at the jubilee. The reason
in both cases is sufficiently evident; the house in the city might be
built for purposes of trade or traffic merely, the house in the country
was built on or attached to the inheritance which God had divided to the
respective families, and it was therefore absolutely necessary that the
same law should apply to the house as to the inheritance. But the same
necessity did not hold good with respect to the house in the city: and
as we may presume the house in the city was merely for the purpose of
trade, when a man bought such a house, and got his business established
there, it would have been very inconvenient for him to have removed; but
as it was possible that the former owner might have sold the house
rashly, or through the pressure of some very urgent necessity, a year
was allowed him, that during that time he might have leisure to
reconsider his rash act, or so to get through his pressing necessity as
to be able to get back his dwelling. This time was sufficiently long in
either of the above cases; and as such occurrences might have been the
cause of his selling his house, it was necessary that he might have the
opportunity of redeeming his pledge. Again, as the purchaser, having
bought the house merely for the purpose of trade, manufacture, etc.,
must have been at great pains and expense to fit the place for his work,
and establish his business, in which himself, his children, and his
children's children, were to labor and get their bread; hence it was
necessary that he should have some certainty of permanent possession,
without which, we may naturally conjecture, no such purchases ever would
be made. This seems to be the simple reason of the law in both cases.

[Leviticus 25:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">lev 25:32</span></span>

The cities of the Levites - The law in this and the following verses was
also a very wise one. A Levite could not ultimately sell his house: if
sold he could redeem it at any time in the interim between the two
jubilees; but if not redeemed, it must go out at the following jubilee.
And why? "Because Moses framed his laws so much in favor of the
priesthood, that they had peculiar privileges?" etc. Just the reverse:
they were so far from being peculiarly favored that they had no
inheritance in Israel, only their cities, to dwell in: and because their
houses in these cities were the whole that they could call their own,
therefore these houses could not be ultimately alienated. All that they
had to live on besides was from that most precarious source of support,
the freewill-offerings of the people, which depended on the prevalence
of pure religion in the land.

[Leviticus 25:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">lev 25:36</span></span>

Take thou no usury of him - Usury, at present, signifies unlawful
interest for money. Properly, it means the reward or compensation given
for the use of a thing, but is principally spoken of money. For the
definition of the original term, See the note on [Exo
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#025.md).

[Leviticus 25:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">lev 25:42</span></span>

For they are my servants - As God redeemed every Israelite out of
Egyptian bondage, they were therefore to consider themselves as his
property, and that consequently they should not alienate themselves from
him. It was in being his servants, and devoted to his work, that both
their religious and political service consisted. And although their
political liberty might be lost, they knew that their spiritual liberty
never could be forfeited except by an utter alienation from God. God
therefore claims the same right to their persons which he does to their
lands; See the note on [Lev 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#023.md).

[Leviticus 25:43](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">lev 25:43</span></span>

Thou shalt not rule over him with rigor - What is rigorous service?
"Service which is not determined, and service whereof there is no need."
This is the definition given by the Jews; but much more is implied in
this command than is expressed here. Labour beyond the person's
strength, or labor too long continued, or in unhealthy or uncomfortable
places and circumstances, or without sufficient food, etc., is labor
exacted with rigour, and consequently inhuman; and this law is made, not
for the Mosaic dispensation and the Jewish people, but for every
dispensation and for every people under heaven.

[Leviticus 25:50](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">lev 25:50</span></span>

The price of his sale shall be, etc. - This was a very equitable law,
both for the sojourner to whom the man was sold, and to the Israelite
who had been thus sold. The Israelite might redeem himself, or one of
his kindred might redeem him; but this must not be done to the prejudice
of his master, the sojourner. They were therefore to reckon the years he
must have served from that time till the jubilee; and then, taking the
current wages of a servant per year at that time, multiply the remaining
years by that sum, and the aggregate was the sum to be given to his
master for his redemption. The Jews hold that the kindred of such a
person were bound, if in their power, to redeem him, lest he should be
swallowed up among the heathen; and we find, from [Neh
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#008.md), that this was done by the Jews on
their return from the Babylonish captivity: We, after our ability, have
redeemed our brethren the Jews, who were sold unto the heathen.

[Leviticus 25:55](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#055.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">lev 25:55</span></span>

For unto me the children of Israel are servants - The reason of this law
we have already seen, (See on [Lev
25:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#042) (note).md), but we must look
farther to see the great end of it. The Israelites were a typical
people; they represented those under the Gospel dispensation who are
children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. But these last have a
peculiarity of blessing: they are not merely servants, but they are
Sons; though they also serve God, yet it is in the newness of the
spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter. And to this difference of
state the apostle seems evidently to allude, [Gal
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006.md), etc.: And because ye are Sons,
God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying Abba,
Father. Wherefore thou art no more a Servant, but a Son; and if a Son,
then an Heir of God through Christ; genuine believers in Christ not
being heirs of an earthly inheritance, nor merely of a heavenly one, for
they are heirs of God. God himself therefore is their portion, without
whom even heaven itself would not be a state of consummate blessedness
to an immortal spirit. The jubilee was a wonderful institution, and was
of very great service to the religion, freedom, and independence of the
Jewish people. "The motive of this law," says Calmet, "was to prevent
the rich from oppressing the poor, and reducing them to perpetual
slavery; and that they should not get possession of all the lands by way
of purchase, mortgage, or, lastly, usurpation. That debts should not be
multiplied too much, lest thereby the poor should be entirely ruined;
and that slaves should not continue always, they, their wives and
children, in servitude. Besides, Moses intended to preserve, as much as
possible, personal liberty, an equality of property, and the regular
order of families, among the Hebrews. Lastly, he designed that the
people should be strongly attached to their country, lands, and
inheritances; that they should have an affection for them, and consider
them as estates which descended to them from their ancestors which they
were to leave to their posterity, without any fear of their going
ultimately out of their families." But this institution especially
pointed out the redemption of man by Christ Jesus:

1\. Through him, he who was in debt to God's justice had his debt
discharged, and his sin forgiven.

2\. He who sold himself for naught, who was a bondslave of sin and
Satan, regains his liberty and becomes a son of God through faith in his
blood.

3\. He who by transgression had forfeited all right and title to the
kingdom of God, becomes an heir of God, and a joint heir with Christ.
Heaven, his forfeited inheritance, is restored, for the kingdom of
heaven is open to all believers; and thus, redeemed from his debt,
restored to his liberty, united to the heavenly family, and re-entitled
to his inheritance, he goes on his way rejoicing, till he enters the
paradise of his Maker, and is for ever with the Lord.

Reader, hast thou applied for this redemption? Does not the trumpet of
the jubilee, the glad tidings of salvation by Christ Jesus, sound in the
land? Surely it does. Why then continue a bond-slave of sin, a child of
wrath, and an heir of hell, when such a salvation is offered unto thee
without money and without price? O suffer not this provision to be made
ultimately in vain for thee! For what art thou advantaged if thou gain
the whole world and lose thy soul?
