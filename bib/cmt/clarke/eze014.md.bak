### [Ezekiel Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 14:0</span></span>

Here God threatens those hypocrites who pretended to worship him, while
they loved and practiced idolatry, [Eze
14:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#001.md). He declares his irreversible
purpose of punishing so guilty a nation, in behalf of which no
intercession of the people of God shall be of any avail. The gross
idolaters of Jerusalem and Judah shall be visited with God's four sore
judgments, famine, [Eze 14:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#012.md); wild
beasts, [Eze 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#015.md), [Eze
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#016.md); the sword, [Eze
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#017.md), [Eze
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#018.md); and pestilence, [Eze
14:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#019.md). A remnant shall be delivered
from the wrath coming upon the whole land, [Eze
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#022.md), [Eze
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#023.md).

[Ezekiel 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 14:1</span></span>

Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me - These probably came
to tempt him, or get him to say something that would embroil him with
the government. They were bad men, as we shall see in the third verse.

[Ezekiel 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 14:3</span></span>

These men have set up their idols in their heart - Not only in their
houses; in the streets; but they had them in their hearts. These were
stumbling-blocks of iniquity; they fell over them, and broke the neck of
their souls. And should God be inquired of by such miscreants as these?

[Ezekiel 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 14:4</span></span>

According to the multitude of his idols - I will treat him as an
idolater, as a flagrant idolater.

[Ezekiel 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 14:7</span></span>

And cometh to a prophet - Generally supposed to mean a false prophet.

I the Lord will answer him by myself - I shall discover to him, by my
own true prophet, what shall be the fruit of his ways. So, while their
false prophets were assuring them of peace and prosperity, God's
prophets were predicting the calamities that afterwards fell upon them.
Yet they believed the false prophets in preference to the true. Ahab,
about to engage with the Syrians, who had possession of Ramoth-Gilead,
asked Micaiah, the prophet of the Lord, concerning the event; who told
him he should lose the battle. He then inquired of Zedekiah, a false
prophet, who promised him a glorious victory. Ahab believed the latter,
marched against the enemy, was routed, and slain in the battle, [Kg1
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#010.md), etc.

[Ezekiel 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 14:9</span></span>

I the Lord have deceived that prophet - That is, he ran before he was
sent; he willingly became the servant of Satan's illusions; and I
suffered this to take place, because he and his followers refused to
consult and serve me. I have often had occasion to remark that it is
common in the Hebrew language to state a thing as done by the Lord which
he only suffers or permits to be done; for so absolute and universal is
the government of God, that the smallest occurrence cannot take place
without his will or permission.

[Ezekiel 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 14:10</span></span>

The punishment of the prophet - They are both equally guilty; both have
left the Lord, and both shall be equally punished.

[Ezekiel 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 14:13</span></span>

By trespassing grievously - Having been frequently warned, and having
refused to leave their sin, and so filled up the measure of their
iniquity.

[Ezekiel 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 14:14</span></span>

Though - Noah, Daniel, and Job - The intercession even of the holiest of
men shall not avert my judgments. Noah, though a righteous man, could
not by his intercession preserve the old world from being drowned. Job,
though a righteous man, could not preserve his children from being
killed by the fall of their house. Daniel, though a righteous man, could
not prevent the captivity of his country. Daniel must have been
contemporary with Ezekiel. He was taken captive in the third year of
Jehoiakim, [Dan 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001.md). After this
Jehoiakim reigned eight years, [Kg2
23:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#036.md). And this prophecy, as appears
from [Eze 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#001.md), was uttered in the
sixth year of Jehoiachin's captivity, who succeeded Jehoiakim, and
reigned only three months, [Kg2 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#006.md),
[Kg2 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#008.md). Therefore at this time
Daniel had been Fourteen years in captivity. See Newcome. Even at this
time he had gained much public celebrity. From this account we may infer
that Job was as real a person as Noah or Daniel; and of their identity
no man has pretended to doubt. When God, as above, has determined to
punish a nation, no intercession shall avail. Personal holiness alone
can prevent these evils; but the holiness of any man can only avail for
himself.

[Ezekiel 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 14:21</span></span>

My four sore judgments - Sword, war. Famine, occasioned by drought.
Pestilence, epidemic diseases which sweep off a great part of the
inhabitants of a land. The Noisome Beast, the multiplication of wild
beasts in consequence of the general destruction of the inhabitants.

[Ezekiel 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 14:22</span></span>

Behold, they shall come forth unto you - Though there shall be great
desolations in the land of Judea, yet a remnant shall be left that shall
come here also as captives; and their account of the abominations of the
people shall prove to you with what propriety I have acted in abandoning
them to such general destruction. This speech is addressed to those who
were already in captivity; i.e., those who had been led to Babylon with
their king Jeconiah.

[Ezekiel 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 14:23</span></span>

Ye shall know that I have not done without cause - There is no part of
the conduct of God towards man that is not dictated by the purest
principles of justice, equity, and truth. He does nothing but what is
right; and whatever is right to be done, that ought to be done. In God's
justice there is no severity; in God's mercy there is no caprice. He
alone doth all things well; for he is the Fountain of justice and mercy.
