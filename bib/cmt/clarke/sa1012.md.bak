### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 12:0</span></span>

Samuel, grown old, testifies his integrity before the people, which they
confirm, [Sa1 12:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#001.md). He reproves them
for their ingratitude and disobedience; and gives a summary of the
history of their fathers, [Sa1
12:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#006.md). He exhorts them to future
obedience, and calls for a sign from heaven to confirm his authority,
and to show them their disobedience: God sends an extraordinary thunder
and rain, [Sa1 12:13-19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#013.md). He warns them
against idolatry, and exhorts to obedience, and promises to intercede
for them, [Sa1 12:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#020.md). Sums up their
duty, and concludes with a solemn warning, [Sa1
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#024.md), [Sa1
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#025.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 12:1</span></span>

And Samuel said - It is very likely that it was at this public meeting
Samuel delivered the following address; no other time seems to be given
for it, and this is the most proper that could be chosen.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 12:2</span></span>

My sons are with you - It is generally agreed that these words intimate
that Samuel had deprived them of their public employ, and reduced them
to a level with the common people.

Have walked before you from my childhood - He had been a long, steady,
and immaculate servant of the public.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 12:3</span></span>

Witness against me - Did ever a minister of state, in any part of the
world, resign his office with so much self-consciousness of integrity,
backed with the universal approbation of the public? No man was
oppressed under his government, no man defrauded! He had accumulated no
riches for himself; he had procured none for his friends; nor had one
needy dependant been provided for out of the public purse. He might have
pardoned his own sons, who had acted improperly, before he quitted the
government; but though he was the most tender of parents, he would not,
but abandoned them to national justice, with only a tacit solicitation
of mercy: Behold, my sons are with you! They have acted improperly; I
deprived them of their authority; they are amenable to you for their
past conduct; I have walked uprightly and disinterestedly among you;
they have not followed my steps: but can you forgive them for their
father's sake? As a minister of justice, he abandons them to their fate;
as a tender father, he indirectly and modestly pleads for them on the
ground of his own services. Had he not acted thus in both these
relations, he would have been unworthy of that character which he so
deservedly bears.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 12:4</span></span>

They said, Thou hast not defrauded - Of what minister or governor can
any nation under heaven say such things?

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 12:7</span></span>

Now therefore stand still - I have arraigned myself before God and you;
I now arraign you before God.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 12:8</span></span>

The Lord sent Moses and Aaron - He shows them that through all their
history God had ever raised them up deliverers, when their necessities
required such interference.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 12:9</span></span>

The hand of Sisera - See these transactions in the book of Judges, [Jdg
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#002) (note.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 12:11</span></span>

Jerubbaal - That is, Gideon. And Bedan: instead of Bedan, whose name
occurs nowhere else as a judge or deliverer of Israel, the Septuagint
have Barak; the same reading is found in the Syriac and Arabic. The
Targum has Samson. Many commentators are of this opinion; but Calmet
thinks that Jair is intended, who judged Israel twenty-two years, [Jdg
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#003.md). Instead of Samuel the Syriac and
Arabic have Samson; and it is most natural to suppose that Samuel does
not mention himself in this place. St. Paul's authority confirms these
alterations: The time would fail me, says he, to tell of Gideon, of
Barak, of Samson, of Jephthah, of David, etc.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 12:12</span></span>

When ye saw that Nahash - This was not the first time they had demanded
a king; see before, [Sa1 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#005.md). But at
the crisis mentioned here they became more importunate; and it was in
consequence of this that the kingdom was a second time confirmed to
Saul. Saul was elected at Mizpeh, he was confirmed at Gilgal.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 12:14</span></span>

If ye will fear the Lord, etc. - On condition that ye rebel no more, God
will take you and your king under his merciful protection, and he and
his kingdom shall be confirmed and continued.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa1 12:16</span></span>

This great thing - This unusual occurrence.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa1 12:17</span></span>

Is it not wheat harvest to-day? - That is, This is the time of wheat
harvest. According to St. Jerome, who spent several years in the
promised land, this harvest commenced about the end of June or beginning
of July, in which he says he never saw rain in Judea: Nunquam enim in
fine mensis Junii, sive in mense Julio, in his provinciis, maximeque in
Judea, pluvias vidimus. - Hier. in [Amo
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#007.md); where he refers to this very
history. What occurred now hardly ever occurs there but in the winter
months.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa1 12:18</span></span>

The Lord sent thunder and rain that day - This was totally unusual; and,
as it came at the call of Samuel, was a most evident miracle.

Greatly feared the Lord - They dreaded His terrible majesty; and they
feared Samuel, perceiving that he had so much power with God.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 12:19</span></span>

Pray for thy servants - that we die not - As they knew they had rebelled
against God, they saw that they had every thing to fear from his justice
and power.

We have added unto all our sins this evil - It is no sin to have a king;
a good king is one of the greatest blessings of God's providence; but it
is a sin to put a man in the place of God. Is it not strange that they
did not now attempt to repair their fault? They might have done it, but
they did not; they acknowledged their sin, but did not put it away. This
is the general way of mankind. "God help us, we are all sinners!" is the
general language of all people: but though to be a sinner is to be in
the most solemn and awful circumstances, yet they are contented to bear
the character, heedless of the consequences!

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 12:20</span></span>

Ye have done all this wickedness - That is, although ye have done all
this wickedness: what was past God would pass by, provided they would be
obedient in future.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa1 12:21</span></span>

After vain things - That is, idols; which he calls here התהו hattohu,
the same expression found [Gen 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002.md).
The earth was תהו tohu; it was waste, empty, and formless: so idols;
they are confusion, and things of naught, for an idol is nothing in the
world, it is not the representative of any intelligent being.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa1 12:22</span></span>

The Lord will not forsake his people - He will not as yet cast you off,
though you have deserved it. His purpose in preserving them in their
land and religion was not yet accomplished. It was not however for their
sake that he would not cast them off, but for his own great name's sake.
He drew his reasons from himself.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa1 12:23</span></span>

God forbid that I should sin - They had earnestly begged him, [Sa1
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#019.md), to pray to God for them, that
they might not die; and he tells them that he should consider himself a
sinner, should he cease to be their intercessor.

But I will teach you the good and the right way - I will show you, as
long as I am with you, what true religion is; it is the way to happiness
and heaven. It is right - there is no crookedness in it; it is good -
there is no evil in it.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa1 12:24</span></span>

Only fear the Lord - Know, respect, and reverence him.

Serve him - Consider him your Lord and Master; consider yourselves his
servants.

In truth - Be ever honest, ever sincere; with all your heart - have
every affection engaged in the work of obedience; act not merely from a
principle of duty, but also from a pious, affectionate sense of
obligation. Act towards your God as an affectionate child should act
towards a tender and loving parent.

Consider how great things - Review the history of your fathers, review
your own life; see what interpositions of power, mercy, goodness, and
truth, God has displayed in your behalf! Has he not daily loaded you
with his benefits?

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa1 12:25</span></span>

Ye shall be consumed - If ye do wickedly you shall be destroyed, your
kingdom destroyed, and your king destroyed. Here they had set before
them life and good, death and evil. Never was a people more fully
warned, and never did a people profit less by the warning; and they
continue to this day monuments of God's justice and forbearance. Reader,
What art thou? Perhaps a similar monument. Consider therefore what great
things God has done for thee.
