### [Jeremiah Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 25:0</span></span>

This chapter contains a summary of the judgments denounced by Jeremiah
against Judah, Babylon, and many other nations. It begins with reproving
the Jews for disobeying the calls of God to repentance, [Jer
25:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#001.md); on which account their
captivity, with that of her neighboring nations, during seventy years,
is foretold, [Jer 25:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#008.md). At the
expiration of that period, (computing from the invasion of
Nebuchadnezzar in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, to the famous edict of
the first year of Cyrus), an end was to be put to the Babylonian empire,
[Jer 25:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#012.md). All this is again
declared by the emblem of that cup of wrath which the prophet, as it
should seem in a vision, tendered to all the nations which he
enumerates, [Jer 25:15-29](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015.md). And for
farther confirmation, it is a third time repeated in a very beautiful
and elevated strain of poetry, [Jer
25:30-38](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#030.md). The talent of diversifying
the ideas, images, and language, even when the subject is the same, or
nearly so, appears no where in such perfection as among the sacred
poets.

[Jeremiah 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 25:1</span></span>

The word that came to Jeremiah - to the fourth year - This prophecy, we
see, was delivered in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, and the chapter that
contains it is utterly out of its place. It should be between chapters
35 and 36.

The defeat of the Egyptians by Nebuchadnezzar at Carchemish, and the
subsequent taking of Jerusalem, occurred in this year, viz., the fourth
year of Jehoiakim.

The first year of Nebuchadrezzar - This king was associated with his
father two years before the death of the latter. The Jews reckon his
reign from this time, and this was the first of those two years; but the
Chaldeans date the commencement of his reign two years later, viz., at
the death of his father.

[Jeremiah 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 25:7</span></span>

That ye might provoke - Ye would not hearken; but chose to provoke me
with anger.

[Jeremiah 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 25:9</span></span>

Behold, I will send - At this time Nebuchadrezzar had not invaded the
land, according to this Version; but the Hebrew may be translated,
"Behold I am sending, and have taken all the families;" that is, all the
allies of the king of Babylon.

Instead of ואל reel, "and To Nebuchadrezzar," as in the common Hebrew
Bible, seven MSS. of Kennicott's and De Rossi's, and one of my own, have
ואת veeth, "And Nebuchadrezzar," which is undoubtedly the true reading.

[Jeremiah 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 25:10</span></span>

I will take from them - See [Jer 7:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#034.md),
and [Jer 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#009.md).

The sound of the mill-stones, and the light of the candle - These two
are conjoined, because they generally ground the corn before day, by the
light of the candle. Sir J. Chardin has remarked, that every where in
the morning may be heard the noise of the mills; for they generally
grind every day just as much as is necessary for the day's consumption.
Where then the noise of the grill is not heard, nor the light of the
candle seen, there must be desolation; because these things are heard
and seen in every inhabited country.

[Jeremiah 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 25:11</span></span>

Shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years - As this prophecy was
delivered in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, and in the first of
Nebuchadnezzar, and began to be accomplished in the same year, (for then
Nebuchadnezzar invaded Judea, and took Jerusalem), seventy years from
this time will reach down to the first year of Cyrus, when he made his
proclamation for the restoration of the Jews, and the rebuilding of
Jerusalem. See the note on [Isa 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#019.md)
(note), where the subject is farther considered in relation to the reign
of Nebuchadnezzar, and the city of Babylon.

[Jeremiah 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 25:12</span></span>

And that nation - הגוי ההוא haggoi hahu. Dr. Blayney contends that this
should be translated his nation, and that ההוא hahu is the substantive
pronoun used in the genitive case. It is certainly more clear and
definite to read, "I will punish the king of Babylon, and His nation."

Will make it perpetual desolations - See the note on [Isa
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#019.md), where the fulfillment of this
prophecy is distinctly marked.

[Jeremiah 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 25:14</span></span>

Many nations and great kings - The Medes and the Persians, under Cyrus;
and several princes, his vassals or allies.

[Jeremiah 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 25:16</span></span>

Take the wine cup of this fury - For an ample illustration of this
passage and simile, see the note on [Isa
51:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#021.md).

[Jeremiah 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 25:17</span></span>

Then took I the cup - and made all the nations to drink - This cup of
God's wrath is merely symbolical, and simply means that the prophet
should declare to all these people that they shall fall under the
Chaldean yoke, and that this is a punishment inflicted on them by God
for their iniquities. "Then I took the cup;" I declared publicly the
tribulation that God was about to bring on Jerusalem, the cities of
Judah, and all the nations.

[Jeremiah 25:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 25:19</span></span>

Pharaoh king of Egypt - This was Pharaoh-necho, who was the principal
cause of instigating the neighboring nations to form a league against
the Chaldeans.

[Jeremiah 25:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 25:20</span></span>

All the mingled people - The strangers and foreigners; Abyssinians and
others who had settled in Egypt.

Land of Uz - A part of Arabia near to Idumea. See on [Job
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001) (note.md).

[Jeremiah 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 25:22</span></span>

Tyrus and - Zidon - The most ancient of all the cities of the
Phoenicians.

Kings of the isles which are beyond the sea - As the Mediterranean Sea
is most probably meant, and the Phoenicians had numerous colonies on its
coasts, I prefer the marginal reading, the kings of the region by the
sea side.

[Jeremiah 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 25:23</span></span>

Dedan - Was son of Abraham, by Keturah, [Gen
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#003.md).

Tema - Was one of the sons of Ishmael, in the north of Arabia, [Gen
36:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#015.md).

Buz - Brother of Uz, descendants of Nahor, brother of Abraham, settled
in Arabia Deserta, [Gen 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#021.md).

[Jeremiah 25:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 25:24</span></span>

The mingled people - Probably the Scenite Arabians.

[Jeremiah 25:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 25:25</span></span>

Zimri - Descendants of Abraham, by Keturah, [Gen
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#002.md), [Gen
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#006.md).

Elam - Called Elymais by the Greeks, was on the south frontier of Media,
to the north of Susiana, not far from Babylon.

[Jeremiah 25:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 25:26</span></span>

The kings of the north, far and near - The first may mean Syria; the
latter, the Hyrcanians and Bactrians.

And the king of Sheshach shall drink after them - Sheshach was an
ancient king of Babylon, who was deified after his death. Here it means
either Babylon, or Nebuchadnezzar the king of it. After it has been the
occasion of ruin to so many other nations, Babylon itself shall be
destroyed by the Medo-Persians.

[Jeremiah 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 25:27</span></span>

Be drunken, and spue - Why did we not use the word vomit, less offensive
than the other, and yet of the same signification?

[Jeremiah 25:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 25:29</span></span>

given up to the destruction.

[Jeremiah 25:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jer 25:32</span></span>

Evil shall go forth from nation to nation - One nation after another
shall fall before the Chaldeans.

[Jeremiah 25:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jer 25:33</span></span>

From one end of the earth - From one end of the land to the other. All
Palestine shall be desolated by it.

[Jeremiah 25:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jer 25:34</span></span>

Howl, ye shepherds - Ye kings and chiefs of the people.

Ye shall fall like a pleasant tresses - As a fall will break and utterly
ruin a precious vessel of crystal, agate, etc., so your overthrow will
be to you irreparable ruin.

[Jeremiah 25:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">jer 25:38</span></span>
