### [Isaiah Chapter 60](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 60:0</span></span>

The glorious prospect displayed in this chapter seems to have elevated
the prophet even above his usual majesty. The subject is the very
flourishing condition of the Church of Jesus Christ at that period of
the Gospel dispensation when both Jews and Gentiles shall become one
fold under one Shepherd. The imagery employed is of the most consolatory
and magnificent description. This blessed state of the world shall
follow a time of gross darkness, [Isa
60:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#001.md), [Isa
60:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#002.md). The universal diffusion of vital
godliness beautifully set forth by a great variety of images, [Isa
60:3-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#003.md). The everlasting duration and
spotless purity of this kingdom of Christ, [Isa
60:15-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#015.md). A time appointed in the
counsels of Jehovah for the commencement of this happy period; and when
this time arrives, the particulars of the prophecy shall have a speedy
accomplishment, [Isa 60:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#022.md).

The subject of this chapter is the great increase and flourishing state
of the Church of God by the conversion and accession of the heathen
nations to it, which is set forth in such ample and exalted terms, as
plainly show that the full completion of this prophecy is reserved for
future times. This subject is displayed in the most splendid colors
under a great variety of images highly poetical, designed to give a
general idea of the glories of that perfect state of the Church of God
which we are taught to expect in the latter times; when the fullness of
the Gentiles shall come in, and the Jews shall be converted and gathered
from their dispersions, and the kingdoms of this world shall become the
kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ.

Of the use in prophecy of general or common poetical images, in setting
forth the greatness and importance of a future event universally,
without descending to particulars, or too minutely explaining
circumstances, I have already pretty largely treated in the twentieth
prelection on the Hebrew poetry; and have more than once observed in
these notes that such images are not always to he applied particularly
to persons and things, and were never intended to be minutely explained.
I shall add here the opinion of a very learned and judicious person upon
this subject: "It is, I think, a mark of right understanding in the
language of prophecy, and in the design of prophecy too, to keep to what
appears the design and meaning of the prophecy in general, and what the
whole of it laid together points out to us, and not to suffer a warm
imagination to mislead us from the real intention of the spirit of
prophecy, by following uncertain applications of the parts of it."
Lowman on the Revelation, note on [Rev
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#021) (note.md). - L. To this testimony I
must add my own. This is one of the most glorious chapters in the whole
of the Old Testament. The splendor, glory, and excellence of the Church
of Christ are here pointed out in language which the Spirit of God alone
is capable of using. But when shall this state of blessedness take
place? Lord, thou only knowest.

[Isaiah 60:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 60:1</span></span>

Arise - Call upon God through Christ, for his salvation; and,

Shine - אורי ori, be illuminated: for till thou arise and call upon God,
thou wilt never receive true light.

For thy light is come - כי בא אורך ki ba orech, for thy light cometh.
The Messiah is at the door; who, while he is a light to lighten the
Gentiles, will be the glory - the effulgence, of his people Israel.

[Isaiah 60:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 60:2</span></span>

Darkness shall cover the earth - This is the state of the Gentile
people.

[Isaiah 60:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 60:3</span></span>

And the Gentiles shall come - This has been in some sort already
fulfilled. The Gentiles have received the light of the Gospel from the
land of Judea, and the Gentile kings have embraced that Gospel; so that
many nations of the earth are full of the doctrine of Christ.

[Isaiah 60:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 60:4</span></span>

Shall be nursed at thy side "Shall be carried at the side" - For תאמנה
teamanah, shall be nursed, the Septuagint and Chaldee read תנשאנה
tinnasenah, shall be carried. A MS. has על כתף תנשאנה al catheph
tinnasenah, "shall be carried on the shoulder;" instead of על צד תאמנה
al tsad teamanah, "shall be nursed on the side." Another MS. has both
כתף catheph and צד tsad. Another MS. has it thus: תאמנה:תנשאנה
tinnasenah: teamanah, with a line drawn over the first word. Sir John
Chardin says that it is the general custom in the east to carry their
children astride upon the hip with the arm round their body. His MS.
note on this place is as follows: - Coutume en Orient de porter les
enfans sur le coste a; califourchon sur la hanche: cette facon est
generale aux Indes; les enfans se tiennent comme cela, et la personne
qui les porte les embrasse et serre par le corps; parceque sont (ni)
emmaillottes, ni en robes qui les embrassent. "In the east it is the
custom to carry the children on the haunch, with the legs astride. This
is the general custom in India. The children support themselves in this
way, and the arm of the nurse goes round the body and presses the child
close to the side; and this they can easily do, as the children are not
swathed, nor encumbered with clothes." Non brachiis occidentalium more,
sed humeris, divaricatis tibiis, impositos circumferunt. "They carry
them about, not in their arms after the manner of the western nations,
but on their shoulders; the children being placed astride." Cotovic.
Iter. Syr. cap. 14. This last quotation seems to favor the reading על
כתף by al catheph, on the shoulder, as the Septuagint likewise do: but
upon the whole I think that על צד תנשאנה al tsad tinnasenah is the true
reading, which the Chaldee favors; and I have accordingly followed it.
See [Isa 66:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#012.md). - L. This mode of
carrying children is as common in India as carrying them in the arms is
in Europe.

[Isaiah 60:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 60:5</span></span>

Then thou shalt see "Then shalt thou fear" - For תראי tirai, thou shalt
see, as ours and much the greater number of the translators, ancient and
modern, render it, forty MSS. (ten ancient) of Kennicott's, and
twenty-eight of De Rossi's, with one ancient of my own, and the old
edition of 1488, have תיראי tirai, thou shalt fear: the true reading,
confirmed by the perfect parallelism of the sentences: the heart ruffled
and dilated in the second line answering to the fear and joy expressed
in the first. The Prophet Jeremiah, [Jer
33:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#009.md), has the same natural and elegant
sentiment: -

"And this city shall become to me a name of joy;

A praise and an honor for all the nations of the earth;

Which shall hear all the good that I do unto them:

And they shall fear, and they shall tremble, at all the goodness

And at all the prosperity that I procure unto her."

And David: -

"I will praise thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made."

[Psa 139:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#014.md)

His tibi me rebus quaedam divina voluptas

Percipit atque horror.

Lucret. 3:28.

Recenti mens trepidat metu,

Plenoque Bacchi pectore turbidum

Laetatur.

Hor. Carm. 2:19. 50:5.

[Isaiah 60:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 60:6</span></span>

The praises of the Lord "And the praise of Jehovah" - Thirty-three MSS.
and three editions have ותהלת uthehillath, in the singular number; and
so read the ancient versions, and one of my own MSS.

[Isaiah 60:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 60:7</span></span>

The rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee - Vitringa on the place
understands their ministering, and ascending or going up on the altar,
as offering themselves voluntarily: ipsi se, non expectato sacerdote
alto, gloriae et sanctificationi divini nominis ultro ac libenter
oblaturi. "They, waiting for no priest, go and freely offer themselves
to the glory and sanctification of the sacred name." This gives a very
elegant and poetical turn to the image. It was a general notion that
prevailed with sacrificers among the heathen, that the victim's being
brought without reluctance to the altar was a good omen; and the
contrary a bad one. Sabinos petit aliquanto tristior; quod sacrificanti
hostia aufugerat. Sueton. Titus, cap. 10. Accessit dirum omen, profugus
altaribus tauris. "It was an omen of dreadful portent when the victim
fled away from the altar." Tacit. Hist. 3:56. - L.

[Isaiah 60:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 60:8</span></span>

And as the doves to their windows "And like doves upon the wing?" -
Instead of אל el, to, forty-two MSS. of Kennicott's, and one of mine,
have by על, upon. For ארבתיהם arubboteyhem, their windows, read אברתיהם
ebrotheyhem, their wings, transposing a letter. - Houbigant. The
Septuagint render it συν νεοσσοις, "with their young;" they read אפרחיהם
ephrocheyhem, nearer to the latter than to the present reading. - L.

[Isaiah 60:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 60:9</span></span>

The ships of Tarshish first "The ships of Tarshish among the first" -
For בראשנה barishonah twenty-five MSS. and the Syriac read כבראשנה
kebarishonah, "as at the first." The ships of Tarshish AS at the first;
that is, as they brought gold and silver in the days of Solomon.

[Isaiah 60:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 60:13</span></span>

And I will make the place of my feet glorious "And that I may glorify
the place whereon I rest my feet" - The temple of Jerusalem was called
the house of God, and the place of his rest or residence. The visible
symbolical appearance of God, called by the Jews the schechinah, was in
the most holy place, between the wings of the cherubim, above the ark.
This is considered as the throne of God, presiding as King over the
Jewish state; and as a footstool is a necessary appendage to a throne,
(see note on [Isa 52:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#002) (note).md), the
ark is considered as the footstool of God, and is so called, [Psa
99:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#006.md); [Ch1
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#002.md).

The glory of Lebanon - That is, the cedar.

[Isaiah 60:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 60:19</span></span>

Neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee "Nor by night
shall the brightness of the moon enlighten thee" - This line, as it
stands in the present text, seems to be defective. The Septuagint and
Chaldee both express the night, which is almost necessary to answer to
day in the preceding line, as well as to perfect the sense here. I
therefore think that we ought, upon the authority of the Septuagint and
Chaldee, to read either ולילה velailah, and by night, instead of ולנגה
ulenogah, and for brightness; or ולנגה בלילה ulenogah ballailah, adding
the word בלילה ballailah, by night. - L.

[Isaiah 60:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 60:21</span></span>

Of my planting - מטעי mattai; so, with the Keri, read forty-four MSS.
(seven ancient) and six editions; with which agree the Syriac, Chaldee,
and Vulgate.

[Isaiah 60:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 60:22</span></span>

I the Lord will hasten it in his time - There is a time set for the
fulfillment of this prophecy: that time must come before it begins to
take place; but when it does begin, the whole will be performed in a
short space. It is not, therefore, the time determined for the event
that shall be hastened, but all the circumstances of the event; all the
parts of the prediction shall be speedily completed. I the Lorde in hys
tyme sodeynly schal boun thys. - Old MS. Bible. And because it is the
Lord, therefore it will be done: for although it be difficult, he is
almighty.
