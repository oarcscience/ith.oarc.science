### [Numbers Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 13:0</span></span>

Twelve men, one out of every tribe, are sent to examine the nature and
state of the land of Canaan, [Num
13:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#001.md). Their names, [Num
13:4-16](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#004.md). Moses gives them particular
directions, [Num 13:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#017.md). They
proceed on their journey, [Num 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#021.md),
[Num 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#022.md). Come to Eshcol, and cut
down a branch with a cluster of grapes, which they bear between two of
them upon a staff, [Num 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#023.md), [Num
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#024.md). After forty days they return to
Paran, from searching the land, and show to Moses and the people the
fruit they had brought with them, [Num
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#025.md), [Num
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#026.md). Their report - they acknowledge
that the land is good, but that the inhabitants are such as the
Israelites cannot hope to conquer, [Num
13:27-29](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#027.md). Caleb endeavors to do away
the bad impression made, by the report of his fellows, upon the minds of
the people, [Num 13:30](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#030.md). But the others
persist in their former statement, [Num
13:31](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#031.md) : and greatly amplify the
difficulties of conquest, [Num 13:32](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#032.md),
[Num 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#033.md).

[Numbers 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 13:2</span></span>

Send thou men, that they may search - It appears from [Deu
1:19-24](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#019.md) that this was done in
consequence of the request of the people, after the following address of
Moses: "And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great
and terrible wilderness - and we came unto Kadesh-Barnea; and I said
unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the Lord
our God doth give unto us. Behold the Lord thy God hath set the land
before thee: go up and possess it, as the Lord God of thy fathers hath
said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged. And ye came near unto
me every one of you, and said: We Will Send Men Before Us, And They
Shall Search Us Out The Land and bring us word again, by what way we
must go up, and into what cities we shall come. And the saying pleased
me well, and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe," etc., etc.
Nearly the whole of these verses is added here by the Samaritan.

Every one a ruler - Not any of the princes of the people, (see Numbers
1) for these names are different from those; but these now sent were men
of consideration and importance in their respective tribes.

[Numbers 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 13:13</span></span>

Sethur, the son of Michael - It would have been strange had the numerous
searches after the explanation of the mystical number 666, [Rev
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#018.md); [Rev
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#005.md), met with nothing to their
purpose in the name of this son of Michael. סתור Sethur, from סתר
sathar, to hide or conceal, signifies hidden or mysterious, and includes
in it the numerical letters of the No. 666: ס60, + ת400, + ו6, + ר200, =
666. But of what utility can such expositions be to any subject of
history or theology?

[Numbers 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 13:16</span></span>

And Moses called Oshea Jehoshua - Oshea, Heb. הושע should be written
Hoshea: the word signifies saved, or a savior, or salvation; but יהושע,
he shall save, or the salvation of God; a letter, says Calmet, of the
incommunicable name of God, being added to his former name. This was not
the first time in which he had the name Joshua; see [Exo
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#009) (note.md), and the note there. Some
suppose he had this change of name in consequence of his victory over
Amalek; see [Exo 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#013.md), [Exo
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#014.md).

[Numbers 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">num 13:18</span></span>

See the land, what it is - What sort of a Country it is; how situated;
its natural advantages or disadvantages.

And the people - whether they be strong or weak - Healthy, robust, hardy
men; or little, weak, and pusillanimous.

[Numbers 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 13:20</span></span>

The land - whether it be fat or lean - Whether the Soil be rich or poor;
which might be known by its being well wooded, and by the fruits it
produced; and therefore they were desired to examine it as to the trees,
etc., and to bring some of the fruits with them.

[Numbers 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 13:21</span></span>

From the wilderness of Zin - The place called; צן Tsin, here, is
different from that called סין Sin or Seen. [Exo
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#001.md); the latter was nigh to Egypt,
but the former was near Kadesh Barnea, not far from the borders of the
promised land.

"The spies having left Kadesh Barnea, which was in the desert of Paran,
see [Num 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#026.md), they proceeded to the
desert of Tsin, all along the land of Canaan, nearly following the
course of the river Jordan, till they came to Rehob, a city situated
near Mount Libanus, at the northern extremity of the Holy Land, towards
the road that leads to Hamath. Thence they returned through the midst of
the same land by the borders of the Sidonians and Philistines, and
passing by Mount Hebron, rendered famous by the residence of Abraham
formerly, and by the gigantic descendants of Anak at that time, they
passed through the valley of the brook of Eshcol, where they cut down
the bunch of grapes mentioned [Num
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#023.md), and returned to the Israelitish
camp after an absence of forty days," [Num
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#025.md). See Calmet on this place.

[Numbers 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">num 13:22</span></span>

Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt - The Zoan of the
Scriptures is allowed to be the Tanis of the heathen historians, which
was the capital of Lower Egypt. Some think it was to humble the pride of
the Egyptians, who boasted the highest antiquity, that this note
concerning the higher antiquity of Hebron was introduced by Moses. Some
have supposed that it is more likely to have been originally a marginal
note, which in process of time crept into the text; but all the versions
and all the MSS. that have as yet been collated, acknowledge it.

[Numbers 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">num 13:23</span></span>

They bare it between two upon a staff - It would be very easy to produce
a great number of witnesses to prove that grapes in the promised land,
and indeed in various other hot countries, grow to a prodigious size. By
Calmet, Scheuchzer, and Harmer, this subject has been exhausted, and to
these I may refer the reader. Pliny mentions bunches of grapes in Africa
each of which was larger than an infant. Radzvil saw at Rhodes bunches
of grapes three quarters of an ell in length, each grape as large as a
plum. Dandini saw grapes of this size at Mount Libanus; and Paul Lucas
mentions some bunches which he saw at Damascus that weighed above
forty-five pounds. From the most authentic accounts the Egyptian grape
is very small, and this being the only one with which the Israelites
were acquainted, the great size of the grapes of Hebron would appear
still more extraordinary. I myself once cut down a bunch of grapes
nearly twenty pounds in weight. Those who live in cold climates can
scarcely have any conception to what perfection both grapes and other
fruits grow in climates that are warm, and where the soil is suitable to
them.

From what is mentioned [Num 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#020.md), Now
the time was the time of the first-ripe grapes, it is very probable that
the spies received their orders about the beginning of August, and
returned about the middle of September, as in those countries grapes,
pomegranates, and figs, are ripe about this time; see Harmer, vol. i.,
p. 108-110. At Sheeraz, in Persia, I find from a MS. journal, that the
small white grape, askerie, came into season August 6; and pomegranates
September 6; and the large red grape, sahibi, September 10.

The spies' carrying the bunch of grapes on a staff between two men was
probably not rendered necessary by the size of the bunch or cluster; but
to preserve it from being bruised, that the Israelites might have a fair
specimen of the fruit As Joshua and Caleb were the only persons who gave
a favorable account of the land, it is most likely that they were the
persons who had gathered these fruits, and who brought them to the
Israelitish camp. And it is likely they were gathered as short a time as
possible before their return, that they might not be injured by the
length of the time they had been separated from their respective trees.

[Numbers 13:27](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">num 13:27</span></span>

We came unto the land, etc. - It is astonishing that men so dastardly as
these should have had courage enough to risk their persons in searching
the land. But probably though destitute of valor they had a sufficiency
of cunning, and this carried them through. The report they brought was
exceedingly discouraging, and naturally tended to produce the effect
mentioned in the next chapter. The conduct of Joshua and Caleb was alone
magnanimous, and worthy of the cause in which they were embarked.

[Numbers 13:32](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">num 13:32</span></span>

Men of a great stature - אנשי מדות anshey middoth, men of measures - two
men's height; i. e., exceedingly tall men.

[Numbers 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">num 13:33</span></span>

There we saw the giants - נפלים nephilim. It is evident that they had
seen a robust, sturdy, warlike race of men, and of great stature; for
the asserted fact is not denied by Joshua or Caleb.

Tales of gigantic men are frequent in all countries, but they are
generally of such as have lived in times very remote from those in which
such tales are told. That there have been giants at different times, in
various parts of the earth, there can be no doubt; but that there ever
was a nation of men twelve and fourteen feet high, we cannot, should not
believe. Goliath appears to have been at least nine feet high: this was
very extraordinary. I knew three young men in my own neighborhood, two
of them brothers, each of whom was upwards of seven feet, the third was
eight feet six inches, and these men were very well proportioned. Others
I have seen of extraordinary stature, but they were generally
disproportioned, especially in their limbs. These instances serve to
prove the possibility of cases of this nature. The Anakim might appear
to the Israelites as a very tall, robust nation; and in comparison of
the latter it is very probable that they were so, as it is very likely
that the growth of the Israelites had been greatly cramped with their
long and severe servitude in Egypt. And this may in some measure account
for their alarm. On this subject the reader is desired to turn back to
the note on [Gen 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#004) (note.md).

Canaan was a type of the kingdom of God; the wilderness through which
the Israelites passed, of the difficulties and trials to be met with in
the present world. The promise of the kingdom of God is given to every
believer; but how many are discouraged by the difficulties in the way! A
slothful heart sees dangers, lions, and giants, every where; and
therefore refuses to proceed in the heavenly path. Many of the spies
contribute to this by the bad reports they bring of the heavenly
country. Certain preachers allow "that the land is good, that it flows
with milk and honey," and go so far as to show some of its fruits; but
they discourage the people by stating the impossibility of overcoming
their enemies. "Sin," say they, "cannot be destroyed in this life - it
will always dwell in you - the Anakim cannot be conquered - we are but
as grasshoppers against the Anakim," etc., etc. Here and there a Joshua
and a Caleb, trusting alone in the power of God, armed with faith in the
infinite efficacy of that blood which cleanses from all unrighteousness,
boldly stand forth and say: "Their defense is departed from them, and
the Lord is with us; let us go up at once and possess the land, for we
are well able to overcome." We can do all things through Christ
strengthening us: he will purify us unto himself, and give us that rest
from sin here which his death has procured and his word has promised.
Reader, canst thou not take God at his word? He has never yet failed
thee. Surely then thou hast no reason to doubt. Thou hast never yet
tried him to the uttermost. Thou knowest not how far and how fully he
can save. Do not be dispirited: the sons of Anak shall fall before thee,
if thou meet them in the name of the Lord of Hosts.
