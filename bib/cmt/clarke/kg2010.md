### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg2 10:0</span></span>

Jehu sends an ironical letter to the elders of Samaria, telling them to
choose one of the best of their master's sons, and put him on the
throne; to which they return a submissive answer, [Kg2
10:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#001.md). He writes a second letter, and
orders them to send him the heads of Ahab's seventy sons; they do so,
and they are laid in two heaps at the gate of Jezreel, [Kg2
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#007.md), [Kg2
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#008.md). Jehu shows them to the people,
and excuses himself, and states that all is done according to the word
of the Lord, [Kg2 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#009.md), [Kg2
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#010.md). He destroys all the kindred of
Ahab that remained in Jezreel, [Kg2
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#011.md). He also destroys forty-two men,
the brethren of Ahaziah, king of Judah, [Kg2
10:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#012.md). He meets with Jehonadab, and
takes him with him in his chariot, [Kg2
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#015.md), [Kg2
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#016.md). He comes to Samaria, and
destroys all that were of the kindred of Ahab there, [Kg2
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#017.md). He pretends a great zeal for
the worship of Baal, and gathers all his priests together, under the
pretense of a grand sacrifice, and slays them all, [Kg2
10:18-25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#018.md). He burns Baal's images, and
makes his temple a draught house, [Kg2
10:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#026.md). But he does not depart from
the sins of Jeroboam, and does not prosper, [Kg2
10:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#029.md). Hazael vexes Israel, [Kg2
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#032.md), [Kg2
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#033.md). Jehu dies, having reigned over
Israel, in Samaria, twenty-eight years, [Kg2
10:34-36](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#034.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 10:1</span></span>

Ahab had seventy sons - As he had several wives, he might have many
children. The Israelites, from the earliest part of their history, were
remarkably fruitful. How amazingly did they multiply in Egypt, even
under the hand of the severest oppression! And as to the individuals of
whose families we have an account, they are quite remarkable: Rehoboam
had thirty-eight sons; Abdon had forty; Tola had thirty; Ahab, seventy;
and Gideon, seventy-one.

Unto the rulers of Jezreel - It certainly should be, unto the rulers of
Samaria; for to them and to that city the whole context shows us the
letters were sent. See [Kg2 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#006.md).

To them that brought up Ahab's children - It appears that the royal
children of Israel and Judah were intrusted to the care of the nobles,
and were brought up by them, (see [Kg2
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#006).md); and to these, therefore, Jehu's
letters are directed. It is supposed Isaiah ([Isa
49:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#023).md) alludes to this custom: Kings
shall be thy nursing fathers, and queens thy nursing mothers.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 10:2</span></span>

A fenced city also - All here seems to refer to Samaria alone; in it
were the magazines and implements of war, etc. No reader need be told
that these letters were all ironical. It was the same as if he had said,
"Ye have no means of defense; Israel is with me: if you yield not up
yourselves and the city, I will put you all to the sword.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 10:4</span></span>

Two kings stood not before him - That is Joram and Ahaziah.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 10:5</span></span>

He that was over the house, etc. - Thus all the constituted authorities
agreed to submit.

Will do all that thou shalt bid us - They made no conditions, and stood
pledged to commit the horrid murders which this most execrable man
afterwards commanded.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 10:6</span></span>

Come to me to Jezreel - Therefore the letters were not written to
Jezreel, but from Jezreel to Samaria.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 10:7</span></span>

Put their heads in baskets - What cold-blooded wretches were the whole
of these people!

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 10:8</span></span>

Lay ye them in two heaps - It appears that the heads of these princes
had arrived at Jezreel in the night time: Jehu ordered them to be left
at the gate of the city, a place of public resort, that all the people
might see them, and be struck with terror, and conclude that all
resistance to such authority and power would be vain.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 10:9</span></span>

Ye be righteous - Another irony, intended partly to excuse himself, and
to involve them in the odium of this massacre, and at the same time to
justify the conduct of both, by showing that all was done according to
the commandment of the Lord.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 10:11</span></span>

Jehu slew all - So it appears that the great men who had so obsequiously
taken off the heads of Ahab's seventy sons, fell also a sacrifice to the
ambition of this incomparably bad man.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 10:12</span></span>

The shearing house - Probably the place where the shepherds met for the
annual sheep shearing.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 10:13</span></span>

The brethren of Ahaziah - The relatives of his family; for it does not
appear that he had any brethren, properly so called: but we know that
the term brethren among the Jews signified the relatives of the same
family, and especially brothers' and sisters' children: and that these
were such, see [Ch2 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#008.md).

We go down to salute, etc. - So promptly had Jehu executed all his
measures, that even the nearest relatives of the murdered kings had not
heard of their death, and consequently had no time to escape. They were
all taken as in a net.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 10:14</span></span>

The pit of the shearing house - Probably the place where they washed the
sheep previously to shearing, or the fleeces after they were shorn off.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 10:15</span></span>

Jehonadab the son of Rechab - For particulars concerning this man, his
ancestry, and posterity, see the notes on Jeremiah 35 (note).

Is thine heart right - With me, in the prosecution of a reform in
Israel; as my heart is with thy heart in the true religion of Jehovah,
and the destruction of Baal?

It is - I wish a reform in the religion of the country; I am his friend
who shall endeavor to promote it.

Give me thine hand - This has been generally considered as exacting a
promise from Jehonadab; but does it mean any more than his taking him by
the hand, to help him to step into his chariot, in which Jehu was then
sitting? Jehonadab was doubtless a very honorable man in Israel; and by
carrying him about with him in his chariot, Jehu endeavored to acquire
the public esteem. "Jehu must be acting right, for Jehonadab is with
him, and approves his conduct."

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 10:16</span></span>

Come with me, and see my zeal for the Lord - O thou ostentatious and
murderous hypocrite! Thou have zeal for Jehovah and his pure religion!
Witness thy calves at Dan and Bethel, and the general profligacy of thy
conduct. He who can call another to witness his zeal for religion, or
his works of charity, has as much of both as serves his own turn.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 10:18</span></span>

Ahab served Baal a little - Jehu had determined to have no worship in
Israel but that of the golden calves at Dan and Bethel; therefore he
purposes to destroy all the worshippers of Baal: and that he may do it
without suspicion, he proclaims a great sacrifice; and that he may do it
the more easily, he gathers them all together into one place.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 10:19</span></span>

Whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live - Because, as he will
thereby show himself without zeal for the service of his God, he will
justly forfeit his life. All this was done in the very spirit of deceit.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg2 10:22</span></span>

He said unto him that was over the vestry - The word vestry comes from
vestiarium, and that from vestes, garments, from vestio, I clothe; and
signifies properly the place where the sacerdotal robes and pontifical
ornaments are kept. The priests of Baal had their robes as well as the
priests of the Lord; but the garments were such that one could be easily
distinguished from the other.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 10:23</span></span>

None of the servants of the Lord - Though he was not attached to that
service, yet he would tolerate it; and as he was led to suppose that he
was fulfilling the will of Jehovah in what he was doing, he would of
course treat his worship and worshippers with the more respect.

He might have ordered the search to be made on pretense of expelling any
of those whom they would consider the profane, especially as this was "a
solemn assembly for Baal," as was the custom with the heathen when any
extraordinary exhibition of or for their god was expected; thus
Callimachus, (Hymn to Apollo), after imagining the temple and its
suburbs to be shaken by the approach of Apollo, cries out, Εκας, ἑκας,
ὁστις, αλιτρος. To prevent any suspicion of his real design, such might
have been Jehu's plea, else alarm must have been excited, and perhaps
some would have escaped.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 10:25</span></span>

As soon as he had made an end of offering - Had Jehu been a man of any
conscientious principle in religion, he would have finished the tragedy
before he offered the burnt-offering; but to a man of no religion, the
worship of Jehovah and of Baal are alike. If he prefers either, it is
merely as a statesman, for political purposes.

To the guard and to the captains - לרצים ולשלשים leratsim uleshalashim;
to the couriers or runners, and the shalashim, the men of the third
rank, those officers who were next to the nobles, the king and these
being only their superiors. The runners were probably a sort of light
infantry.

The city of the house of Baal - Does not this mean a sort of holy of
holies, where the most sacred images of Baal were kept? A place
separated from the temple of Baal, as the holy of holies in the temple
of Jehovah was separated from what was called the holy place.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 10:27</span></span>

Made it a draught house - A place for human excrement; so all the
versions understand it. Nothing could be more degrading than this; he
made it a public necessary.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg2 10:30</span></span>

Thy children of the fourth generation - These four descendants of Jehu
were Jehoahaz, Jehoash, Jeroboam the second, and Zechariah; see 2 Kings
14 and 15. This was all the compensation Jehu had in either world, as a
recompense of his zeal for the Lord.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg2 10:31</span></span>

Jehu took no heed - He never made it his study; indeed, he never
intended to walk in this way; it neither suited his disposition nor his
politics.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg2 10:32</span></span>

The Lord began to cut Israel short - The marginal reading is best: The
Lord cut off the ends; and this he did by permitting Hazael to seize on
the coasts, to conquer and occupy the frontier towns. This was the
commencement of those miserable ravages which Elisha predicted; see [Kg2
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#012.md). And we find from the next verse
that he seized on all the land of Gilead, and that of Reuben and Gad,
and the half tribe of Manasseh; in a word, whatever Israel possessed on
the east side of Jordan.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg2 10:34</span></span>

Are they not written in the book of the chronicles - We have no
chronicles in which there is any thing farther spoken of this bad man.
His reign was long, twenty-eight years; and yet we know nothing of it
but the commencement.

For barbarity and hypocrisy Jehu has few parallels; and the cowardliness
and baseness of the nobles of Samaria have seldom been equalled. Ahab's
bloody house must be cut off; but did God ever design that it should be
done by these means? The men were, no doubt, profligate and wicked, and
God permitted their iniquity to manifest itself in this way; and thus
the purpose of God, that Ahab's house should no more reign, was
completely accomplished: see [Kg1
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#019.md), [Kg1
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#021.md), [Kg1
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#029.md). And by this conduct Jehu is
said to have executed what was right in God's eyes, [Kg2
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#030.md). The cutting off of Ahab's
family was decreed by the Divine justice; the means by which it was
done, or at least the manner of doing, were not entirely of his
appointing: yet the commission given him by the young prophet, [Kg2
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#007.md), was very extensive. Yet still
many things seem to be attributed to God, as the agent, which he does
not execute, but only permits to be done.
