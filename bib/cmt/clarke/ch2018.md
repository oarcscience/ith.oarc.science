### [2 Chronicles Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 18:0</span></span>

Jehoshaphat joins affinity with Ahab, king of Israel, [Ch2
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#001), [Ch2
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#002); who invites him to assist him in
the war against the Syrians, to which Jehoshaphat agrees, [Ch2
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#003). They consult the prophets
concerning the success of the war; and all, except Micaiah, promise Ahab
victory, [Ch2 18:4-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#004). Micaiah relates
his vision concerning the lying spirit in the mouth of Ahab's prophets,
[Ch2 18:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#018). Zedekiah, a false
prophet, opposes Micaiah; and Micaiah is put in prison, [Ch2
18:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#023). Both the kings go against
the Syrians; the confederate armies are defeated, and the king of Israel
slain, [Ch2 18:28-31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#028).

[2 Chronicles 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 18:1</span></span>

Jehoshaphat had riches and honor - The preceding chapter gives ample
proof of this.

Joined affinity with Ahab - Took his daughter Athalia to be wife to his
son Joram.

[2 Chronicles 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 18:3</span></span>

To Ramoth-gilead - This place belonged to the Israelites, and was now
held by the king of Syria.

The whole of this chapter is circumstantially explained in the notes on
1 Kings 22:1-53.

[2 Chronicles 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 18:9</span></span>

The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat - "Ahab consulted false prophets; but
Jehoshaphat sought instruction from the presence of the Lord, and prayed
at the entering in of Samaria; and before these all the false prophets
prophesied lies." - Targum.

[2 Chronicles 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 18:20</span></span>

Then there came out a spirit - The Targum gives a strange gloss here:
"Then the spirit of Naboth of Jezreel came out from the abode of the
righteous, and stood before the Lord, and said, I will deceive him. And
the Lord said, By what means? To which he answered, I will be a spirit
of false prophecy in the mouth of his prophets. And the Lord said, Thou
mayest then. But although the power of deceiving them is given unto
thee, nevertheless it will not be lawful for thee to sit among the
righteous; for whosoever shall speak falsely cannot have a mansion among
the righteous. Therefore go forth from me, and do as thou hast said." -
Targum.

[2 Chronicles 18:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">ch2 18:29</span></span>

I will disguise myself - See the note on [Kg1
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#030).

[2 Chronicles 18:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">ch2 18:31</span></span>

But Jehoshaphat cried out - "Jehoshaphat cried, and the Word of the Lord
brought him assistance." - Targum.

[2 Chronicles 18:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">ch2 18:33</span></span>

A certain man drew a bow - The Targum tells us who it was. "Now, Naaman,
the captain of the host of the great king of Syria, drew a bow against
him, (that the prophecy of Elijah the Tishbite, and of Micaiah the son
of Imla, might be fulfilled), and smote the king of Israel between the
heart and the caul of the liver, through the place where the coat of
mail is joined." See the note on [Kg2
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#001) for this tradition.

[2 Chronicles 18:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">ch2 18:34</span></span>

Stayed himself up - against the Syrians - There was a great deal of true
personal courage and patriotism in this last act of the king of Israel:
he well knew that if his troops found that he was mortally wounded, they
would immediately give way, and the battle would not only be lost, but
the slaughter would be great in the pursuit; therefore he stayed himself
up till the evening, when the termination of the day must necessarily
bring the battle to a close: and when this was done, the Israelites
found that their king was slain, and so they left the field of battle to
their foes. Thus Israel had a great loss, and the Syrians had got a
great deliverance. Had it not been for this accident, the Syrians had
probably been defeated. See on [Kg1
22:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#036) (note).

In the notes referred to above, the quibbling predictions of false
prophets and lying oracles are mentioned, and several instances given;
and the whole account of the lying spirit going forth from the Lord to
deceive Ahab, particularly considered. See especially the notes as above
on [Ch2 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#019) (note), [Ch2
18:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#023) (note).

The reader should never forget a truth so very frequently occurring in
the Bible, that God is repeatedly represented as doing what, in the
course of his providence, he only permits to be done.
