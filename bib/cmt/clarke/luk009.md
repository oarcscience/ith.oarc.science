### [Luke Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#001)

[Luke](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">luk 9:0</span></span>

Christ sends his apostles to preach and work miracles, [Luk
9:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#001). Herod, hearing of the fame of
Jesus, is perplexed; some suppose that John Baptist is risen from the
dead; others, that Elijah or one of the old prophets was come to life,
[Luk 9:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#007). The apostles return and
relate the success of their mission. He goes to a retired place, and the
people follow him, [Luk 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#010), [Luk
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#011). He feeds five thousand men with
five loaves and two fishes, [Luk
9:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#012). He asks his disciples what
the public think of him, [Luk 9:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#018).
Foretells his passion, [Luk 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#022).
Shows the necessity of self-denial, and the importance of salvation,
[Luk 9:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#023). Threatens those who deny
him before men, [Luk 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#026). The
transfiguration, [Luk 9:27-36](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#027). Cures a
demoniac, [Luk 9:37-43](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#037). Again
foretells his passion, [Luk 9:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#044), [Luk
9:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#045). The disciples contend who shall
be greatest, [Luk 9:46-48](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#046). Of the
person who cast out devils in Christ's name, but did not associate with
the disciples, [Luk 9:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#049), [Luk
9:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#050). Of the Samaritans who would not
receive him, [Luk 9:51-56](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#051). Of the man
who wished to follow Jesus, [Luk 9:57](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#057),
[Luk 9:58](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#058). He calls another disciple
who asks permission first to bury his father, [Luk
9:59](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#059). Our Lord's answer [Luk
9:60-62](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#060).

[Luke 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 9:1</span></span>

Power and authority - Δυναμιν και εξουσιαν. The words properly mean
here, the power to work miracles; and that authority by which the whole
demoniac system was to be subjected to them. The reader will please to
observe:

1\. That Luke mentions both demons and diseases; therefore he was either
mistaken, or demons and diseases are not the same.

2\. The treatment of these two was not the same: - the demons were to be
cast out, the diseases to be healed. See [Mat
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#001).

[Luke 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 9:2</span></span>

To preach the kingdom of God - For an explication of this phrase, see on
[Mat 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001) (note).

[Luke 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 9:3</span></span>

Take nothing - See on [Mar 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#007), [Mar
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#008) (note).

Neither money - See on [Mat 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#009)
(note).

Neither have two coats - Show that in all things ye are ambassadors for
God; and go on his charges.

[Luke 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 9:4</span></span>

There abide, and thence depart - That is, remain in that lodging till ye
depart from that city. Some MSS. and versions add μη, which makes the
following sense: There remain, and depart Not thence. See the note on
[Mat 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#011).

[Luke 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 9:7</span></span>

Herod the tetrarch - See on [Mat 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#001)
(note); [Mat 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#001) (note).

By him - This is omitted by BCDL, two others, the Coptic, Sahidic,
Armenian, and four of the Itala. It is probable that Luke might have
written, Herod, hearing of all the things that were done, etc.; but
Matthew says particularly, that it was the fame of Jesus of which he
heard: [Mat 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#001).

He was perplexed; - He was greatly perplexed διηπορει· from δια emphat.
and απορεω, I am in perplexity. It is a metaphor taken from a traveler,
who in his journey meets with several paths, one only of which leads to
the place whither he would go; and, not knowing which to take, he is
distressed with perplexity and doubt. The verb comes from α, negative,
and πορος, a way or passage. A guilty conscience is a continual pest: -
Herod had murdered John, and he is terribly afraid, lest he should arise
from the dead, and bring his deeds to light, and expose him to that
punishment which he deserved. See [Mar
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#016).

[Luke 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 9:10</span></span>

Told him all - Related distinctly - διηγησαντο, from δια, through, and
ἡγεομαι, I declare: hence the whole of this Gospel, because of its
relating every thing so particularly, is termed διηγησις, [Luk
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001), a particular and circumstantially
detailed narration. See on [Mar 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#030)
(note).

[Luke 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 9:11</span></span>

The people - followed him - Observe here five grand effects of Divine
grace.

1\. The people are drawn to follow him.

2\. He kindly receives them.

3\. He instructs them in the things of God.

4\. He heals all their diseases.

5\. He feeds their bodies and their souls. See Quesnel.

Reader! Jesus is the same to the present moment. Follow him, and he will
receive, instruct, heal, feed, and save thy soul unto eternal life.

[Luke 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 9:12</span></span>

Send the multitude away - See this miracle explained at large, on the
parallel places, [Mat 14:15-21](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#015) (note);
[Mar 6:36-44](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#036) (note).

[Luke 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 9:16</span></span>

Then he took the five loaves - A minister of the Gospel, who is employed
to feed souls, should imitate this conduct of Christ:

1\. He ought to exhort the people to hear with sedate and humble
reverence.

2\. He should first take the bread of life himself, that he may be
strengthened to feed others.

3\. He ought frequently to lift his soul to God, in order to draw down
the Divine blessing on himself and his hearers.

4\. He should break the loaves - divide rightly the word of truth, and
give to all such portions as are suited to their capacities and states.

5\. What he cannot perform himself, he should endeavor to effect by the
ministry of others; employing every promising talent, for the
edification of the whole, which he finds among the members of the Church
of God. Under such a pastor, the flock of Christ will increase and
multiply. See Quesnel.

[Luke 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 9:18</span></span>

Whom say the people - Οἱ οχλοι, the common people, i.e. the mass of the
people. See this question considered on [Mat
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#013) (note), etc.

[Luke 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 9:20</span></span>

But whom say ye that I am? - Whom do ye tell the people that I am? What
do ye preach concerning me? See also on [Mat
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#014) (note); and see the observations
at the end of this chapter, (note).

The Christ of God - The Coptic and later Persic read, Thou art Christ
God. After this comes in Peter's confession of our Lord, as related [Mat
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#016) (note), etc., where see the
notes; and see also the observations of Granville Sharp, Esq., at the
end of this chapter.

[Luke 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 9:23</span></span>

If any man will come after me - See on [Mat
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#024) (note), and on [Mar
8:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#034) (note), where the nature of
proselytism among the Jews is explained.

Daily - Καθ' ἡμεραν is omitted by many reputable MSS., versions, and
fathers. It is not found in the parallel places, [Mat
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#024); [Mar
8:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#034).

[Luke 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 9:24</span></span>

Will save his life - See on [Mat 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#024)
(note), etc.

[Luke 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 9:25</span></span>

Lose himself - That is, his life or soul. See the parallel places, [Mat
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#025) (note); [Mar
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#035) (note), and especially the note
on the former.

Or be cast away? - Or receive spiritual damage η ζημιωθεις. I have added
the word spiritual here, which I conceive to be necessarily implied.
Because, if a man received only temporal damage in some respect or
other, yet gaining the whole world must amply compensate him. But if he
should receive spiritual damage - hurt to his soul in the smallest
degree, the possession of the universe could not indemnify him. Earthly
goods may repair earthly losses, but they cannot repair any breach that
may be made in the peace or holiness of the soul. See on [Mat
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#026) (note).

[Luke 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 9:26</span></span>

Ashamed of me - See on [Mar 8:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#038)
(note).

[Luke 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 9:28</span></span>

About an eight days after - See the whole of this important transaction
explained at large on [Mat 17:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#001)
(note).

[Luke 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 9:31</span></span>

His decease - Την εξοδον αυτον, That going out (or death) of his. That
peculiar kind of death - its nature, circumstances, and necessity being
considered. Instead of εξοδον, thirteen MSS. have δοξαν, glory. They
spoke of that glory of his, which he was about to fill up (πληρουν) at
Jerusalem. The Ethiopic unites both readings. The death of Jesus was his
glory, because, by it, he gained the victory over sin, death, and hell,
and purchased salvation and eternal glory for a lost world.

[Luke 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 9:33</span></span>

It is good for us to be here - Some MSS. add παντοτε, It is good for us
to be Always here.

[Luke 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">luk 9:35</span></span>

This is my beloved Son - Instead of ὁ αγαπητος, the beloved one, some
MSS. and versions have εκλεκτος, the chosen one: and the Ethiopic
translator, as in several other cases, to be sure of the true reading,
retains both.

In whom I am well pleased, or have delighted - is added by some very
ancient MSS. Perhaps this addition is taken from [Mat
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#005).

[Luke 9:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 9:37</span></span>

Much people - See on [Mat 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#014)
(note).

[Luke 9:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">luk 9:39</span></span>

A spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out - Πνευμα λαμβανει αυτον.
This very phrase is used by heathen writers, when they speak of
supernatural influence. The following, from Herodotus, will make the
matter, I hope, quite plain. Speaking of Scyles, king of the Scythians,
who was more fond of Grecian manners and customs than of those of his
countrymen, and who desired to be privately initiated into the Bacchic
mysteries, he adds: "Now because the Scythians reproach the Greeks with
these Bacchanals, and say that to imagine a god driving men into
paroxysms of madness is not agreeable to sound reason, a certain
Borysthenian, while the king was performing the ceremonies of
initiation, went out, and discovered the matter to the Scythian army in
these words: 'Ye Scythians ridicule us because we celebrate the
Bacchanals, και ἡμεας ὁ θεος ΛΑΜΒΑΝΕΙ, and the God Possesses Us: but now
the same demon, οὑτος ὁ δαιμων, has Taken Possession, ΛΕΛΑΒΗΚΕ, of your
king, for he celebrates the Bacchanals, and ὑπο του θεου μαινεται, is
filled with fury by this god." Herodot. l. iv. p. 250, edit. Gale.

This passage is exceedingly remarkable. The very expressions which Luke
uses here are made use of by Herodotus. A demon, δαιμων, is the agent in
the Greek historian, and a demon is the agent in the case mentioned in
the text, [Luk 9:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#042). In both cases it
is said the demon possesses the persons, and the very same word,
λαμβανει is used to express this in both historians. Both historians
show that the possessions were real, by the effects produced in the
persons: the heathen king rages with fury through the influence of the
demon called the god Bacchus; the person in the text screams out,
(κραζει), is greatly convulsed, and foams at the mouth. Here was a real
possession, and such as often took place among those who were
worshippers of demons.

[Luke 9:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">luk 9:42</span></span>

The devil threw him down, and tare him - See this case considered at
large, on [Mat 17:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#015) (note), and on
[Mar 9:14-27](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#014) (note).

[Luke 9:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">luk 9:43</span></span>

The mighty power - This majesty of God, μεγαλειοτητι του Θεου. They
plainly saw that it was a case in which any power inferior to that of
God could be of no avail; and they were deeply struck with the majesty
of God manifested in the conduct of the blessed Jesus.

[Luke 9:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">luk 9:44</span></span>

Let these sayings sink down into your ears - Or, put these words into
your ears. To other words, you may lend occasional attention, but to
what concerns my sufferings and death you must ever listen. Let them
constantly occupy a place in your most serious meditations and
reflections.

[Luke 9:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">luk 9:45</span></span>

But they understood not - See the note on [Mar
9:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#032).

[Luke 9:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">luk 9:46</span></span>

There arose a reasoning - Εισηλθε δε διαλογισμος, A dialogue took place
- one inquired, and another answered, and so on. See this subject
explained on [Mat 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#001) (note), etc.

[Luke 9:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">luk 9:49</span></span>

We forbade him - See this subject considered on [Mar
9:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#038) (note), etc.

[Luke 9:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">luk 9:51</span></span>

That he should be received up - Bishop Pearce says: "I think the word
αναληψεως must signify, of Jesus's retiring or withdrawing himself, and
not of his being received up: because the word συμπληρουσθαι, here used
before it, denotes a time completed, which that of his ascension was not
then. The sense is, that the time was come, when Jesus was no longer to
retire from Judea and the parts about Jerusalem as he had hitherto done;
for he had lived altogether in Galilee, lest the Jews should have laid
hold on him, before the work of his ministry was ended, and full proofs
of his Divine mission given, and some of the prophecies concerning him
accomplished. John says, [Joh 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#001) :
Jesus walked in Galilee; for he would not walk in Jewry, because the
Jews sought to kill him. Let it be observed, that all which follows here
in Luke, to [Luk 19:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#045), is represented
by him as done by Jesus in his last journey from Galilee to Jerusalem."

He steadfastly set his face - That is, after proper and mature
deliberation, he chose now to go up to Jerusalem, and firmly determined
to accomplish his design.

[Luke 9:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#052)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">luk 9:52</span></span>

Sent messengers - Αγγελους, angels, literally; but this proves that the
word angel signifies a messenger of any kind, whether Divine or human.
The messengers in this case were probably James and John.

[Luke 9:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#053)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">luk 9:53</span></span>

His face was - They saw he was going up to Jerusalem to keep the feast;
(it was the feast of tabernacles, [Joh
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#002)); and knowing him thereby to be a
Jew, they would afford nothing for his entertainment; for, in religious
matters, the Samaritans and Jews had no dealings: see [Joh
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#009). The Samaritans were a kind of
mongrel heathens; they feared Jehovah, and served other gods, [Kg2
17:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#034). They apostatized from the true
religion, and persecuted those who were attached to it. See an account
of them, [Mat 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#001) (note). Those only
who have deserted the truth of God, or who are uninfluenced by it, hate
them who embrace and act by it. When a man has once decidedly taken the
road to heaven, he can have but little credit any longer in the world,
[Jo1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#001).

[Luke 9:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#054)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">luk 9:54</span></span>

That we command fire - Vengeance belongs to the Lord. What we suffer for
his sake, should be left to himself to reprove or punish. The insult is
offered to him, not to us. See the note on [Mar
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#017).

[Luke 9:55](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#055)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">luk 9:55</span></span>

Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of - Ye do not consider that
the present is a dispensation of infinite mercy and love; and that the
design of God is not to destroy sinners, but to give them space to
repent, that he may save them unto eternal life. And ye do not consider
that the zeal which you feel springs from an evil principle, being more
concerned for your own honor than for the honor of God. The disciples of
that Christ who died for his enemies should never think of avenging
themselves on their persecutors.

[Luke 9:56](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#056)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">luk 9:56</span></span>

And they went to another village - Which probably did entertain them;
being, perhaps, without the Samaritan borders.

The words, Ye know not of what spirit ye are; for the Son of man is not
come to destroy men's lives, but to save them, are wanting in
ABCEGHLS-V, and in many others. Griesbach leaves the latter clause out
of the text. It is probable that the most ancient MSS. read the passage
thus: But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not of what
spirit ye are. And they went to another village. See the authorities in
Griesbach.

[Luke 9:57](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#057)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">luk 9:57</span></span>

A certain man - He was a scribe. See on [Mat
8:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#019) (note). It is probable that
this took place when Christ was at Capernaum, as Matthew represents it,
and not on the way to Jerusalem through Samaria.

[Luke 9:61](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#061)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_061">luk 9:61</span></span>

Another also said - This circumstance is not mentioned by any of the
other evangelists; and Matthew alone mentions the former case, [Luk
9:57](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#057), [Luk
9:58](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#058).

Let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home - Επιτρεψον μοι
αποταξασθαι τοις εις τον οικον μου - Permit me to set in order my
affairs at home. Those who understand the Greek text will see at once
that it will bear this translation well; and that this is the most
natural. This person seems to have had in view the case of Elisha, who
made a similar request to the Prophet Elijah, [Kg1
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#019), [Kg1
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#020), which request was granted by
the prophet; but our Lord, seeing that this person had too much
attachment to the earth, and that his return to worldly employments,
though for a short time, was likely to become the means of stifling the
good desires which he now felt, refused to grant him that permission.
That which we object to the execution of God's designs is sometimes the
very thing from which we should immediately disengage ourselves.

[Luke 9:62](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#062)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_062">luk 9:62</span></span>

Put his hand to the plough - Can any person properly discharge the work
of the ministry who is engaged in secular employments? A farmer and a
minister of the Gospel are incompatible characters. As a person who
holds the plough cannot keep on a straight furrow if he look behind him;
so he who is employed in the work of the ministry cannot do the work of
an evangelist, if he turn his desires to worldly profits. A good man has
said: "He who thinks it necessary to cultivate the favor of the world is
not far from betraying the interests of God and his Church." Such a
person is not fit, ευθετος, properly disposed, has not his mind properly
directed towards the heavenly inheritance, and is not fit to show the
way to others. In both these verses there is a plain reference to the
call of Elisha. See [Kg1 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#019), etc.

1\. Considering the life of mortification and self-denial which Christ
and his disciples led, it is surprising to find that any one should
voluntarily offer to be his disciple. But there is such an attractive
influence in truth, and such a persuasive eloquence in the consistent
steady conduct of a righteous man, that the first must have admirers,
and the latter, imitators. Christianity, as it is generally exhibited,
has little attractive in it; and it is no wonder that the cross of
Christ is not prized, as the blessings of it are not known; and they can
be known and exhibited by him only who follows Christ fully.

2\. It is natural for man to wish to do the work of God in his own
spirit; hence he is ready to call down fire and brimstone from heaven
against those who do not conform to his own views of things. A spirit of
persecution is abominable. Had man the government of the world, in a
short time, not only sects and parties, but even true religion itself,
would be banished from the face of the earth. Meekness, long-suffering,
and benevolence, become the followers of Christ; and his followers
should ever consider that his work can never be done but in his own
spirit.

Since the notes on Matthew were published, I have received from
Granville Sharp, Esq., a short Treatise, entitled, Remarks on an
important Text, (viz. [Mat 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018)),
which has long been perverted by the Church of Rome, In Support Of Her
Vain And Baneful Pretensions To A Superiority Or Supreme Dominion Over
All Other Episcopal Churches.

As I should feel it an honor to introduce the name of such a veteran in
the cause of religion, liberty, and learning, into my work, so it gives
me pleasure to insert the substance of his tract here, as forming a
strong argument against a most Anti-christian doctrine.

"And I also say unto thee, That thou art Peter; and upon this Rock I
will build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against
it." [Mat 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018).

"The Greek word πετρος (Petros or Peter) does not mean a rock, though it
has, indeed, a relative meaning to the word πετρα, a rock; for it
signifies only a little piece of a rock, or a stone, that has been dug
out of a rock; whereby the dignity of the real foundation intended by
our Lord, which he expressed by the prophetical figure of Petra, (a
rock), must necessarily be understood to bear a proportionable
superiority of dignity and importance above the other preceding word,
Petros; as petra, a real rock, is, comparatively, superior to a mere
stone, or particle from the rock; because a rock is the regular
figurative expression in Holy Scripture for a Divine Protector: יהוה
סלעי Jehovah (is) my rock, ([Sa2 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#002),
and [Psa 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002)). Again, אלהי צורי, my
God (is) my rock; ([Sa2 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#002), and [Psa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002)); and again, ומי צור מבלעדי
אלהינו, and who (is) a rock except our God? [Sa2
22:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#032).

"Many other examples may be found throughout the Holy Scriptures; but
these six alone are surely sufficient to establish the true meaning of
the figurative expression used by our Lord on this occasion; as they
demonstrate that nothing of less importance was to be understood than
that of our Lord's own Divine divinity, as declared by St. Peter in the
preceding context - 'Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God!'

"That our Lord really referred to this declaration of Peter, relating to
his own Divine dignity, as being the true rock, on which he would build
his Church, is established beyond contradiction by our Lord himself, in
the clear distinction which he maintained between the stone (πετρος,
petros) and the rock, (πετρα, petra), by the accurate grammatical terms
in which both these words are expressly recorded. (For whatsoever may
have been the language in which they were really spoken, perhaps in
Chaldee or Syriac, yet in this point the Greek record is our only
authoritative instructer). The first word, πετρος, being a masculine
noun, signifies merely a stone; and the second word, πετρα, though it is
a feminine noun, cannot signify any thing of less magnitude and
importance than a rock, or strong mountain of defense. The true meaning
of the name was at first declared by our Lord to be Cephas, a stone; and
a learned commentator, Edward Leigh, Esq., asserts that πετρος, doth
always signify a Stone, never a rock. Critica Sacra, p. 325.

"With respect to the first. - The word πετρος, petros, in its highest
figurative sense of a stone, when applied to Peter, can represent only
one true believer, or faithful member of Christ's Church, that is, one
out of the great multitude of true believers in Christ, who, as
figurative stones, form altogether the glorious spiritual building of
Christ's Church, and not the foundation on which that Church is built;
because that figurative character cannot, consistently with truth, be
applied to any other person than to God, or to Christ alone, as I have
already demonstrated by several undeniable texts of Holy Scripture. And
though even Christ himself is sometimes, in Holy Scripture, called a
stone, (λιθος, but not πετρος), yet, whenever this figurative expression
is applied to him, it is always with such a clear distinction of
superiority over all other figurative stones as will not admit the least
idea of any vicarial stone to be substituted in his place; as, for
instance: He is called 'the head stone of the corner,' ([Psa
118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022)), 'in Zion a precious corner
stone,' ([Isa 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016)), by whom alone
the other living stones of the spiritual house are rendered 'acceptable
to God;' as St. Peter himself (previous to his citation of that text of
Isaiah) has clearly declared in his address to the Churches dispersed
throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia; wherein he
manifestly explains that very text of Isaiah, as follows: - 'Ye also,'
(says the apostle), 'as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, a
holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices Acceptable To God, By'
(or through) 'Jesus Christ.' ([Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005)). Thus plainly acknowledging the
true foundation, on which the other living stones of the primitive
catholic Church were built, in order to render them 'acceptable to God,'
as 'a holy priesthood.'

And the apostle then proceeds (in the very next verse) to his citation
of the above-mentioned text from Isaiah: - 'Wherefore also,' (says he,
[Pe1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006)), 'it is contained in the
Scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a Chief Corner Stone, elect, precious;
and he that believeth on him' (επ' αυτῳ, on him, that is, on Jesus
Christ, the only Chief Corner Stone) 'shall not be confounded. Unto you,
therefore, which believe' (he) 'Is Precious,' (or, an honor; as rendered
in the margin), 'but unto them which be disobedient' (he is, δε, also)
'the stone which the builders disallowed, the same' (οὑτος, for there is
no other person that can be entitled to this supreme distinction in the
Church) 'is made the Head Of The Corner.'

"From this whole argument of St. Peter, it is manifest that there cannot
be any other true head of the Church than Christ himself; so that the
pretense for setting up a vicarial head on earth, is not only contrary
to St. Peter's instruction to the eastern Churches, long after Christ's
ascent into heaven; but also (with respect to the inexpediency and
impropriety of acknowledging such a vicar on earth as the Roman
pretender) is equally contrary to our Lord's own instruction to his
disciples (and, of course, also contrary to the faith of the true
primitive catholic Church throughout the whole world) when he promised
them, that, 'Where two or three are gathered together in my name' (said
our Lord Jesus, the true rock of the Church) 'there am I in the midst of
them,' [Mat 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#020).

"So that the appointment of any 'vicar on earth,' to represent that rock
or eternal head of the Church whose continual presence, even with the
smallest congregations on earth, is so expressly promised, would be not
only superfluous and vain, but must also be deemed a most ungrateful
affront to the benevolent Promiser of his continual presence; such as
must have been suggested by our spiritual enemies to promote an apostasy
from the only sure foundation, on which the faith, hope, and confidence
of the true catholic Church can be built and supported!

"Thus, I trust that the true sense of the first noun, πετρος, a stone,
is here fairly stated; and also, its relative meaning to the second
noun, πετρα, a rock, as far as it can reasonably be deemed applicable to
the Apostle Peter.

"And a due consideration also of the second noun, πετρα, a rock, will
produce exactly the same effect; that is, it will demonstrate that the
supreme title of the rock, which, in other texts of Holy Scripture, is
applied to Jehovah, or God, alone, (as I have already shown), most
certainly was not intended by our Lord to be understood as applicable to
his disciple Peter; but only to that true testimony which St. Peter had
just before declared, concerning the Divine dignity of the Messiah -
'Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.'

"I have already remarked that πετρα (a rock) is a feminine noun; and a
clear distinction is maintained between πετρος, the masculine noun, in
this text, and the said feminine noun πετρα, the rock, by the
grammatical terms in which the latter, in its relatives and articles, is
expressed, which are all regularly feminine throughout the whole
sentence; and thereby they demonstrate that our Lord did not intend that
the new appellation, or nominal distinction, which he had just before
given to Simon, (viz. πετρος, the masculine noun in the beginning of the
sentence), should be construed as the character of which he spoke in the
next part of the sentence; for, if he had really intended that
construction, the same masculine noun, πετρος, must necessarily have
been repeated in the next part of the sentence with a masculine pronoun,
viz. επι τουτῳ τῳ πετρῳ, instead of επι ταυτῃ τῃ πετρᾳ, the present
text; wherein, on the contrary; not only the gender is changed from the
masculine to the feminine, but also the figurative character itself,
which is as much superior, in dignity, to the Apostle Simon, and also to
his new appellative πετρος, as a rock is superior to a mere stone. For
the word πετρος cannot signify any thing more than a stone; so that the
popish application to Peter, (or πετρος), as the foundation of Christ's
Church, is not only inconsistent with the real meaning of the
appellative which Christ, at that very time, conferred upon him, and
with the necessary grammatical construction of it, but also with the
figurative importance of the other word, πετρα, the rock; επι ταυτῃ τῃ
πετρᾳ, 'upon this rock;' the declared foundation of the Church, a title
of dignity, which (as I have already shown by several texts of
Scripture) is applicable only to God or to Christ.

"And be pleased to observe farther, that the application of this supreme
title (the rock) to Peter, is inconsistent (above all) with the plain
reference to the preceding Context; made by our Lord in the beginning of
this very verse - 'And I Also say unto thee' - which manifestly points
out (both by the copulative 'and,' and the connective adverb 'also') the
inseparable connection of this verse with the previous declaration of
Peter, concerning our Lord's Divine dignity in the preceding sentence -
'Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God;' and thereby
demonstrates that our Lord's immediate reply ('And I Also Say unto thee,
etc). did necessarily include this declaration of Peter, as being the
principal object of the sentence - the true foundation, or rock, on
which alone the catholic Church can be properly built; because our faith
in Christ (that he is truly 'the Son of the living God') is
unquestionably the only security or rock of our salvation.

"And Christ was also the rock even of the primitive Church of Israel;
for St. Paul testifies, that 'they' (i.e. the hosts of Israel) 'did all
drink of that spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock
that followed them, and that Rock was Christ,' [Co1
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#004). And the apostle, in a preceding
chapter, ([Co1 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#011)), says, 'Other
foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.'

"In the margin of our English version of [Co1
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#004), instead of 'followed them,' we
find, 'went with them;' which is not only the literal meaning of the
Greek, 'followed them,' but it is also unquestionably true that Christ
was, in a more particular manner, the Rock of their defense, when he
'followed them,' than when he 'went before them,' as related in [Exo
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021), 'And the Lord' (in the Hebrew,
expressly, Jehovah) 'Went Before Them by day in a pillar of a cloud to
Lead Them the way, and by night in a pillar of fire,' etc. Yet,
afterwards, a necessary change was made by the Protector of the hosts of
Israel, in his military manoeuvres with the two marching armies, as we
are informed in the next chapter, [Exo
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#019). For though, at first, 'he went
Before the camp of Israel,' yet he afterwards 'removed, and went Behind
them; and the pillar of the cloud removed from before them, and stood'
(or rather, was stationed in the order of marching) 'behind them.' Which
is properly expressed by St. Paul (in the above-cited text, [Co1
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#004)) as 'the rock that followed
them.' For Christ was more particularly 'a rock of defense to Israel,'
by this changed manoeuvre in following them; because he thereby
prevented the pursuit of their cruel enemies, the standing armies of the
Egyptian tyrant.

"I must remark, however, that in the text, which is parallel to St.
Paul's testimony that Christ was the Rock which followed, viz. [Exo
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#019), [Exo
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#020), Christ is not mentioned under
the supreme title of Jehovah, (as in the preceding chapter, [Exo
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021)), but only as 'an angel of God.'
But the angel appointed to this most gracious and merciful purpose of
the Almighty was really of a supreme Divine dignity, infinitely superior
to all other angels, For (in another parallel text on the same subject,
wherein the title of angel is also given, viz. [Exo
23:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020)), God declared, saying, 'My
name is in him,' (viz. the name Jehovah, signifying all time, past,
present, and future, or the eternal Being). 'Behold,' (said God to the
hosts of Israel), 'I send An Angel' (or a messenger) 'before thee, to
keep thee in the way,' (the object of intention before described), 'and
to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. Beware of him,' \[or
rather, watch, (thyself), or be respectful before him, לפניך or in his
presence\], 'and obey his Voice,' (i.e. the Word of God, the true
character of Christ, even before the creation); 'provoke him not,' (or
rather, murmur not, against him), 'for he will not pardon your
transgressions, for My Name Is In Him,' (not placed upon him, as the
outward tokens of mere temporary authority are given, to be exhibited
like the insignia of nobility, or robes of magistrates, but really 'in
him,' בקרבו 'within him,' i.e. thoroughly included in his personal
existence). 'But if thou shalt indeed obey His Voice,' (i.e. 'the word
of God,' the true figurative character of the Son of God), 'and shalt do
all that I Speak,' (for it is Jehovah, the Lord God, that speaketh in
Christ), 'then I will be an enemy to thine enemies,' etc. It is
therefore unquestionably evident, from the examination of all these
texts, that Christ, whom St. Paul has declared to be 'the rock that
followed' the Israelites, was also the Lord, or Jehovah, (as he is
expressly called in the first text here cited, [Exo
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021)), that 'went before' the
Israelites 'by day,' in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them in 'the way,
and by night in a pillar of fire,' etc., as expressly declared in the
first text cited in this note; and, therefore, an attempt to set up any
mere mortal man, as the rock or foundation of the true catholic Church,
must be attributed either to extreme ignorance of the Holy Scriptures,
or to extreme wickedness; but certainly, also, to the delusions of
spiritual enemies."

That the power of the keys, or of binding and loosing, belonged equally
to all the apostles, the author goes on to prove.

"But there is a testimony of high authority, which renders it
unquestionable that this declaration of our Lord respecting the power of
'binding and loosing,' related 'to them,' (the other disciples), 'as
well as to him:' - even another declaration, made by our Lord himself,
'to his disciples,' respecting the same identical power, which our Lord
attributed equally to all the disciples then present.

"The particular discourse of our Lord to which I now refer seems to have
been made at Capernaum, after the miracle of the fish (bearing the
tribute money in his mouth) which Peter was sent to catch; as related in
the 17th chapter of St. Matthew. And in the beginning of the very next
chapter we are informed as follows: - 'At the Same Time came the
disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of
heaven?' Our Lord's answer to this question (wherein he urges the
necessity of a humiliation like that of little children, as the proper
disposition to qualify mankind for the kingdom of heaven) is continued
from the 2d verse to the 14th verse of this chapter; which shows that
the disciples, in general, were still present, as they would certainly
wait for the desired answer to their own question; and then our Lord
immediately afterwards proceeded to instruct them (from the 15th to the
17th verse) in the general duty of behavior towards a brother that has
trespassed against us. After which our Lord added, (in the 18th verse),
'Verily I say unto You, (ὑμιν, a plural pronoun, which must refer unto
all the disciples that were then assembled), 'Whatsoever Ye Shall Bind
on earth,' (δησητε, a verb in the second person plural, plainly
including all the disciples that were then present), 'shall be bound in
heaven; and whatsoever Ye Shall Loose on earth,' (λυσητε, another plural
verb), 'shall be loosed in heaven.'

"This is exactly the power of the keys, which the Church of Rome has,
most absurdly, attributed to St. Peter alone, in order to invest the
bishops of Rome (on the vain pretense of their being St. Peter's
successors) with an exclusive claim to all these ecclesiastical
privileges of binding and loosing, which our Lord manifestly, in this
parallel text, attributed to all his faithful apostles, without any
partial distinction.

"But the importance of examining, not only parallel texts, but also more
particularly the context, of any difficult sentence in Holy Scripture,
for a more easy comprehension of the true meaning, is clearly
exemplified in the examination of the first text in question, viz. [Mat
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018), [Mat
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#019); for we are informed in the very
next verse, the 20th, that our Lord 'Then charged his disciples,' (τοτε,
then, that is, immediately after his discourse about the rock and keys),
'that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ;' manifestly
referring to the first circumstance of the context concerning himself,
viz. the declaration of Peter, 'Thou art the Christ,' etc., in answer to
his own question to all the disciples - 'Whom say ye that I am?'

"That this question was not addressed to Peter alone is manifest by the
plural pronoun and verb, (ὑμεις λεγετε), 'Whom say Ye that I am?' And
therefore St. Peter's answer must be considered as intended not merely
for himself, but also for his brethren, the other faithful witnesses of
Christ's miracles and doctrines; so that the substance of this answer -
'Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God' - must necessarily be
understood as the true foundation or rock of the Catholic Church,
revealed to Peter by our heavenly Father, as stated in the 17th and 18th
verses.

"This declaration, therefore, that he was the Christ, was manifestly the
subject of our Lord's charge to the disciples, that 'they should tell no
man;' that is, not until after the time of his sufferings and death,
which were the next topics in the continuation of his discourse. The
declaration of Peter, therefore, demonstrated the true foundation, or
rock, of the Church, which (as Christ himself testified) our heavenly
Father had revealed to Peter. And it is also remarkable, that the very
next discourse of our Lord to his disciples, recorded in the context,
([Mat 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#021)), should produce that
severe censure against Peter, which still farther demonstrated that
Peter could not be the rock on which Christ's Church was to be built.
([Mat 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#021)). 'From that time forth'
(απο τοτε) 'began Jesus to show unto his disciples how that he must go
unto Jerusalem, and Suffer many things of the elders, and chief priests,
and scribes, and Be Killed,' (all the predicted consequences of his
being the Christ, the character which Peter himself had declared), 'and'
(that he should) 'be raised again the third day. Then Peter took him,'
([Mat 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#022)), 'and began to rebuke
him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord,' (or, rather, according to the
Greek original, as rendered in the margin - 'Pity thyself, Lord') -
'this shall not be unto thee. But he' (Christ, [Mat
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#023)) 'turned and said unto Peter,'
\[τῳ πετρῳ, the same appellative (signifying a stone, or a small part of
a rock) which was given to Peter by our Lord, in the 18th verse\] - 'Get
thee behind me, Satan, (said our Lord), thou art an offense unto me; for
thou savourest not the things that be of God; but those that be of men.'

"Thus a fair examination and comparison of the whole context, completely
sets aside the vain supposition of the Romish Church, that Peter was the
rock of Christ's Church. And I sincerely hope that a similar attention
to this whole context may prevent any future attempts, that might
otherwise be prompted by the prejudices of Roman Catholics, to bring
forward again this long-disputed question, on which they have vainly set
up the pretended supremacy of the Romish Church above all other
episcopal Churches; and that it may be silenced, and set at rest, for
ever hereafter."
