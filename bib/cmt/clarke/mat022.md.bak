### [Matthew Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#001.md)

[Matthew](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mat 22:0</span></span>

The parable of the marriage of a king's son, [Mat
22:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#001.md). The Pharisees and Herodians
question him concerning the lawfulness of paying tribute to Caesar, [Mat
22:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#015.md). The Sadducees question him
concerning the resurrection, [Mat
22:23-33](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#023.md). A lawyer questions him
concerning the greatest commandment in the law, [Mat
22:34-40](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#034.md). He asks them their opinion
of the Christ, and confounds them, [Mat
22:41-46](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#041.md).

[Matthew 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 22:2</span></span>

The kingdom of heaven - In Bereshith Rabba, sect. 62. fol. 60, there is
a parable very similar to this, and another still more so in Sohar.
Levit. fol. 40. But these rabbinical parables are vastly ennobled by
passing through the hands of our Lord. It appears from Luke, [Luk
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#015.md); etc., that it was at an
entertainment that this parable was originally spoken. It was a constant
practice of our Lord to take the subjects of his discourses from the
persons present, or from the circumstances of times, persons, and
places. See [Mat 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#006.md); [Joh
4:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#007.md); [Joh
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#026.md), [Joh
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#027.md); [Joh
7:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037.md). A preacher that can do so can
never be at a loss for text or sermon.

A marriage for his son - A marriage feast, so the word γαμους properly
means. Or a feast of inauguration, when his son was put in possession of
the government, and thus he and his new subjects became married
together. See [Kg1 1:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#005.md), [Kg1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#019.md), [Kg1
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#025.md), etc., where such a feast is
mentioned.

From this parable it appears plain,

1\. That the King means the great God.

2\. His Son, the Lord Jesus.

3\. The Marriage, his incarnation, or espousing human nature, by taking
it into union with himself.

4\. The Marriage Feast, the economy of the Gospel, during which men are
invited to partake of the blessings purchased by, and consequent on, the
incarnation and death of our blessed Lord.

5\. By those who Had Been bidden, or invited, [Mat
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#003.md), are meant the Jews in general,
who had this union of Christ with human nature, and his sacrifice for
sin, pointed out by various rites, ceremonies, and sacrifices under the
law; and who, by all the prophets, had been constantly invited to
believe in and receive the promised Messiah.

6\. By the Servants, we are to understand the first preachers of the
Gospel, proclaiming salvation to the Jews. John the Baptist and the
seventy disciples ([Luk 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001).md), may be
here particularly intended.

7\. By the Other Servants, [Mat 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#004.md),
the apostles seem to be meant, who, though they were to preach the
Gospel to the whole world, yet were to begin at Jerusalem ([Luk
24:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#047).md) with the first offers of mercy.

8\. By their making light of it, etc., [Mat
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#005.md), is pointed out their neglect of
this salvation, and their preferring secular enjoyments, etc., to the
kingdom of Christ.

9\. By injuriously using some, and slaying others, of his servants, [Mat
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#006.md), is pointed out the persecution
raised against the apostles by the Jews, in which some of them were
martyred.

10\. By sending forth his troops, [Mat
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#007.md), is meant the commission given to
the Romans against Judea; and, burning up their city, the total
destruction of Jerusalem by Titus, the son of Vespasian, which happened
about forty-one years after.

On this parable it is necessary to remark,

1\. That man was made at first in union with God.

2\. That sin entered in, and separated between God and man.

3\. That as there can be no holiness but in union with God, and no
heaven without holiness, therefore he provided a way to reconcile and
reunite man to himself.

4\. This was effected by Christ's uniting himself to human nature, and
giving his Spirit to those who believe.

5\. That as the marriage union is the closest, the most intimate,
solemn, and excellent, of all the connections formed among mortals, and
that they who are thus united in the Lord are one flesh; so that
mystical union which is formed between God and the soul through Jesus
Christ, by the Eternal Spirit, is the closest, most intimate, solemn,
and excellent, that can be conceived; for he who is thus joined unto the
Lord is one spirit.

6\. This contract is made freely: no man can be forced to it, for it is
a union of will to will, heart to heart; and it is by willing and
consenting that we come unto God through his Son.

7\. That if this marriage do not take place here, an eternal separation
from God, and from the glory of his power, shall be the fearful
consequence.

8\. That there are three states in which men run the risk of living
without God and losing their souls.

1st. That of a soft, idle, voluptuous life, wherein a man thinks of
nothing but quietly to enjoy life, conveniences, riches, private
pleasures, and public diversions. They made light of it.

2dly. That of a man wholly taken up with agricultural or commercial
employments, in which the love of riches, and application to the means
of acquiring them, generally stifle all thoughts of salvation. One went
to his own field, and another to his traffic.

3dly. That of a man who is openly unjust, violent, and outrageously
wicked, who is a sinner by profession, and not only neglects his
salvation, but injuriously treats all those who bring him the Gospel of
reconciliation. Seizing his servants, they treated them injuriously,
etc.

[Matthew 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 22:4</span></span>

Fatlings - Τα σιτιϚα Properly, fatted rams, or wethers. [Sa2
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#013.md); [Ch1
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#026.md).

[Matthew 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 22:7</span></span>

But when the king - Himself or, this very king. I have added εκεινος on
the authority of nine of the most ancient MSS. and nearly one hundred
others; the later Syriac, six copies of the Itala, and some of the
fathers. Several printed editions have it, and Griesbach has received it
into the text.

[Matthew 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 22:8</span></span>

Were not worthy - Because they made light of it, and would not come;
preferring earthly things to heavenly blessings. Among the Mohammedans,
refusal to come to a marriage feast, when invited, is considered a
breach of the law of God. Hedayah, vol. iv. p. 91. Any one that shall be
invited to a dinner, and does not accept the invitation, disobeys God,
and his messenger: and any one who comes uninvited, you may say is a
thief, and returns a plunderer. - Mischat ul Mesabih. It was probably
considered in this light among all the oriental nations. This
observation is necessary, in order to point out more forcibly the
iniquity of the refusal mentioned in the text. A man may be said to be
worthy of, or fit for, this marriage feast, when, feeling his
wretchedness and misery, he comes to God in the way appointed, to get an
entrance into the holiest, by the blood of Jesus.

[Matthew 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 22:9</span></span>

Go ye therefore into the highways - Διεξοδους των οδων, cross or
by-paths; the places where two or more roads met in one, leading into
the city, where people were coming together from various quarters of the
country. St. Luke adds hedges, to point out the people to whom the
apostles were sent, as either miserable vagabonds, or the most indigent
poor, who were wandering about the country, or sitting by the sides of
the ways and hedges, imploring relief. This verse points out the final
rejection of the Jews, and the calling of the Gentiles. It was a custom
among the Jews, when a rich man made a feast, to go out and invite in
all destitute travelers. See in Rab. Beracoth, fol. 43.

As many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage - God sends his salvation
to every soul, that all may believe and be saved.

[Matthew 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 22:10</span></span>

Gathered together all - both bad and good - By the preaching of the
Gospel, multitudes of souls are gathered into what is generally termed
the visible Church of Christ.

This Church is the Floor, where the wheat and the chaff are often
mingled, [Mat 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#012.md).

The Field, where the bastard wheat and the true grain grow together,
[Mat 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#026.md), [Mat
13:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#027.md).

The Net, which collects of all kinds, both good and bad, [Mat
13:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#048.md).

The House in which the wise and foolish are found, [Mat
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#001.md), etc.

And the Fold, in which there are both sheep and goats, [Mat
25:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#033.md); etc.

[Matthew 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 22:11</span></span>

When the king came - When God shall come to judge the world.

Wedding garment - Among the orientals, long white robes were worn at
public festivals; and those who appeared on such occasions with any
other garments were esteemed, not only highly culpable, but worthy of
punishment. Our Lord seems here to allude to [Zep
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#007.md), [Zep
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#008.md), The Lord hath prepared a
Sacrifice, he hath Bidden his guests. And it shall come to pass, in the
day of the Lord's sacrifice, that I will Punish the princes, and the
King's Children, and All Such as are clothed with Strange Apparel. The
person who invited the guests prepared such a garment for each, for the
time being; and with which he was furnished on his application to the
ruler of the feast. It was this which made the conduct of the person
mentioned in the text inexcusable; he might have had a proper marriage
garment, if he had applied for it.

To afford accidental guests clothing suitable to a marriage feast, was a
custom among the ancient Greeks. Homer relates that Telemachus, and the
son of Nestor, arriving at Lacedaemon when Menelaus was making a
marriage feast for his son and daughter, were accommodated with garments
suited to the occasion, after having been bathed and anointed.

Τους δ' επει ουν δρωμαι λουσαν και χρισαν ελαιῳ,

Αμφι δ' αρα χλαινας ουλας βαλον ηδε χιτωνας,

Ες ρα θρονους εζοντο παρ' Ατρειδην Μενελαον

Odyss. l. iv. ver. 49-51

They entered each a bath, and by the hands

Of maidens laved, and oiled, and clothed again

With shaggy mantles and resplendent vests,

Sat both enthroned at Menelaus' side.

Cowper

Among the Asiatics, garments called caftans, great numbers of which each
nobleman has ordinarily ready in his wardrobe, are given to persons whom
he wishes to honor: to refuse to accept or wear such a dress would be
deemed the highest insult.

This marriage feast or dinner (the communication of the graces of the
Gospel in this life) prepares for the marriage supper of the Lamb, [Rev
19:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#007.md), the enjoyment of eternal
blessedness in the kingdom of glory. Now, as without holiness no man can
see the Lord, we may at once perceive what our Lord means by the
marriage garment - it is Holiness of heart and life: the text last
quoted asserts that the fine, white, and clean linen (alluding to the
marriage garment above mentioned) was an emblem of the Righteousness of
the Saints. Mark this expression: the righteousness, the whole external
conduct; regulated according to the will and word of God. Of the Saints,
the holy persons, whose souls were purified by the blood of the Lamb.

[Matthew 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 22:12</span></span>

He saith unto him, Friend - Rather, companion: so εταιρε should be
translated. As this man represents the state of a person in the visible
Church, who neglects to come unto the master of the feast for a marriage
garment, for the salvation which Christ has procured, he cannot be with
any propriety called a friend, but may well be termed a companion, as
being a member of the visible Church, and present at all those
ordinances where Christ's presence and blessing are found, by all those
who sincerely wait upon him for salvation.

How camest thou in hither - Why profess to be called by my name while
living without a preparation for my kingdom?

He was speechless - Εφιμωθη, he was muzzled, or gagged. He had nothing
to say in vindication of his neglect. There was a garment provided, but
he neither put it on, nor applied for it. His conduct, therefore, was in
the highest degree insulting and indecorous. As this man is the emblem,
by general consent, of those who shall perish in the last day, may we
not ask, without offense, Where does the doctrine of absolute
reprobation or preterition appear in his case? If Christ had never died
for him, or if he had applied for the garment, and was refused, might he
not well have alleged this in behalf of his soul? - and would not the
just God have listened to it? But there is not the smallest excuse for
him: Christ died, the sacrifice was offered, for him; the ministers of
the Gospel invited him; the Holy Spirit strove with him; he might have
been saved, but he was not: and the fault lies so absolutely at his own
door that the just God is vindicated in his conduct, while he sends him
to hell, not for the lack of what he could not get, but for the lack of
what he might have had, but either neglected or refused it.

Then said the king to the servants - To the ministering angels,
executors of the Divine will.

Cast him into outer darkness - The Jewish marriages were performed in
the night season, and the hall where the feast was made was superbly
illuminated; the outer darkness means, therefore, the darkness on the
outside of this festal hall; rendered still more gloomy to the person
who was suddenly thrust out into it from such a profusion of light. See
all this largely treated of on [Mat
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#012) (note.md).

[Matthew 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 22:14</span></span>

Many are called, etc. - This verse is wanting in one of Colbert's MSS.,
marked 33 in Griesbach. See the note on [Mat
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#016.md). Many are called by the
preaching of the Gospel into the outward communion of the Church of
Christ; but few, comparatively, are chosen to dwell with God in glory,
because they do not come to the master of the feast for a marriage
garment - for that holiness without which none can see the Lord. This is
an allusion to the Roman custom of raising their militia; all were
mustered, but only those were chosen to serve, who were found proper.
See the note on [Mat 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#016.md). Reader!
examine thy soul, and make sure work for eternity!

[Matthew 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 22:15</span></span>

In his talk - Εν λογῳ, by discourse: intending to ask him subtle and
ensnaring questions; his answers to which might involve him either with
the Roman government, or with the great Sanhedrin.

[Matthew 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 22:16</span></span>

The Herodians - For an account of this sect, see the note on [Mat
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#001.md). The preceding parable had
covered the Pharisees with confusion: when it was ended they went out,
not to humble themselves before God, and deprecate the judgments with
which they were threatened; but to plot afresh the destruction of their
teacher. The depth of their malice appears,

1\. In their mode of attack. They had often questioned our Lord on
matters concerning religion; and his answers only served to increase his
reputation, and their confusion. They now shift their ground, and
question him concerning state affairs, and the question is such as must
be answered; and yet the answer, to all human appearance, can be none
other than what may be construed into a crime against the people, or
against the Roman government.

2\. Their profound malice appears farther in the choice of their
companions in this business, viz. the Herodians. Herod was at this very
time at Jerusalem, whither he had come to hold the passover. Jesus,
being of Nazareth, which was in Herod's jurisdiction, was considered as
his subject. Herod himself was extremely attached to the Roman emperor,
and made a public profession of it: all these considerations engaged the
Pharisees to unite the Herodians, who, as the Syriac intimates, were the
domestics of Herod, in this infernal plot.

3\. Their profound malice appears, farther, in the praises they gave our
Lord. Teacher, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God.
This was indeed the real character of our blessed Lord; and now they
bear testimony to the truth, merely with the design to make it subserve
their bloody purposes. Those whose hearts are influenced by the spirit
of the wicked one never do good, but when they hope to accomplish evil
by it. Men who praise you to your face are ever to be suspected. The
Italians have a very expressive proverb on this subject: -

Che ti fa carezze piu che non suole, O t' ha ingannato, o ingannar ti
vuole

He who caresses thee more than he was wont to do, has either Deceived
thee, or is About To Do It.

I have never known the sentiment in this proverb to fail; and it was
notoriously exemplified in the present instance. Flatterers, though they
speak the truth, ever carry about with them a base or malicious soul.

4\. Their malice appears still farther in the question they propose. Is
it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? - [Mat
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#017.md).

The constitution of the Jewish republic, the expectations which they had
of future glory and excellence, and the diversity of opinions which
divided the Jews on this subject, rendered an answer to this question
extremely difficult: -

1\. In the presence of the people, who professed to have no other king
but God, and looked on their independence as an essential point of their
religion.

2\. In the presence of the Pharisees, who were ready to stir up the
people against him, if his decision could be at all construed to be
contrary to their prejudices, or to their religious rights.

3\. In the presence of the Herodians, who, if the answer should appear
to be against Caesar's rights, were ready to inflame their master to
avenge, by the death of our Lord, the affront offered to his master the
emperor.

4\. The answer was difficult, because of the different sentiments of the
Jews on this subject; some maintaining that they could not lawfully pay
tribute to a heathen governor: while others held that as they were now
under this strange government, and had no power to free themselves from
it, it was lawful for them to pay what they had not power to refuse.

5\. The answer was difficult, when it is considered that multitudes of
the people had begun now to receive Jesus as the promised Messiah, who
was to be the deliverer of their nation from spiritual and temporal
oppression, and therefore had lately sung to him the Hosanna Rabba: see
[Mat 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#009.md). If then he should decide
the question in Caesar's favor, what idea must the people have of him,
either as zealous for the law, or as the expected Messiah? If against
Caesar, he is ruined. Who that loved Jesus, and was not convinced of his
sovereign wisdom, could help trembling for him in these circumstances?

Jesus opposes the depth of his wisdom to the depth of their malice, and
manifests it: -

1\. By unmasking them, and showing that he knew the very secrets of
their hearts. Ye Hypocrites! why tempt ye me? i.e. why do ye try me
thus? This must cover them with confusion, when they saw their motives
thus discovered; and tend much to lessen their influence in the sight of
the people, when it was manifest that they acted not through a desire to
receive information, by which to regulate their conduct, but merely to
ensnare and ruin him.

2\. Christ shows his profound wisdom in not attempting to discuss the
question at large; but settled the business by seizing a maxim that was
common among all people, and acknowledged among the Jews, That the
prince who causes his image and titles to be stamped on the current coin
of a country, is virtually acknowledged thereby as the governor. See
Maimon. Gezel. c. v. in Wetstein. When Sultan Mahmoud, king of
Maveralnahar, Turquestan, and the Indies, wished to seize on the
dominions of Seideh, queen of Persia, who governed in the place of her
young son Megededde-vlet, about a.d. 909, he sent an ambassador to her
with the following order: You must acknowledge me for your King, cause
the kootbah to be read, i.e. pray for me in all the mosques of the
kingdom, and Get Your Money recoined, with the Impression That Is On
Mine: thus denoting that she must become absolutely subject to him. See
Bibliot. Orient. de Galand. p. 453. Esau Afghan carried his conquest
into Bhatty, into the viceroyalty of Bengal, and caused the kootbah to
be read, and coin to be struck in the name of the Emperor Akbar. Ayeen
Akbery, vol. ii p. 5. See also p. 38, 92, 94, 130, 139, 187.

[Matthew 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 22:19</span></span>

They brought unto him a penny - A denarius: probably the ordinary
capitation tax, though the poll tax in the law, [Exo
30:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#013.md), [Exo
30:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#014.md), was half a shekel, about twice
as much as the denarius. The Roman denarius had the emperor's image with
a proper legend stamped on one side of it. It was not therefore the
sacred shekel which was to be paid for the repairs of the temple which
was now demanded, but the regular tribute required by the Roman
government.

[Matthew 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mat 22:20</span></span>

Whose is this image and superscription? - He knew well enough whose they
were; but he showed the excellency of his wisdom, 3dly, in making them
answer to their own confusion. They came to ensnare our Lord in his
discourse, and now they are ensnared in their own. He who digs a pit for
his neighbor ordinarily falls into it himself.

[Matthew 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 22:21</span></span>

They say unto him, Caesars - The image was the head of the emperor; the
superscription, his titles. Julius Caesar was the first who caused his
image to be struck on the Roman coin. Tiberius was emperor at this time.

Render therefore unto Caesar - The conclusion is drawn from their own
premises. You acknowledge this to be Caesar's coin; this coin is
current, in your land; the currency of this coin shows the country to be
under the Roman government; and your acknowledgment that it is Caesar's
proves you have submitted. Don't therefore be unjust; but render to
Caesar the things which you acknowledge to be his; at the same time, be
not impious, but render unto God the thing's which belong to God.

This answer is full of consummate wisdom. It establishes the limits,
regulates the rights, and distinguishes the jurisdiction of the two
empires of heaven and earth. The image of princes stamped on their coin
denotes that temporal things belong all to their government. The image
of God stamped on the soul denotes that all its faculties and powers
belong to the Most High, and should be employed in his service.

But while the earth is agitated and distracted with the question of
political rights and wrongs, the reader will naturally ask, What does a
man owe to Caesar? - to the civil government under which he lives? Our
Lord has answered the question - That which IS Caesar's. But what is it
that is Caesar's? 1. Honour. 2. Obedience. And 3. Tribute.

1\. The civil government under which a man lives, and by which he is
protected, demands his honor and reverence.

2\. The laws which are made for the suppression of evil doers, and the
maintenance of good order, which are calculated to promote the benefit
of the whole, and the comfort of the individual should be religiously
obeyed.

3\. The government that charges itself with the support and defense of
the whole, should have its unavoidable expenses, however great, repaid
by the people, in whose behalf they are incurred; therefore we should
pay tribute.

But remember, if Caesar should intrude into the things of God, coin a
new creed, or broach a new Gospel, and affect to rule the conscience,
while he rules the state, in these things Caesar is not to be obeyed; he
is taking the things of God, and he must not get them. Give not
therefore God's things to Caesar, and give not Caesar's things to God.
That which belongs to the commonwealth should, on no account whatever,
be devoted to religious uses; and let no man think he has pleased God,
by giving that to charitable or sacred uses which he has purloined from
the state. The tribute of half a shekel, which the law, ([Exo
30:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#013.md), [Exo
30:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#014).md), required every person above
twenty years of age to pay to the temple, was, after the destruction of
the temple, in the time of Vespasian, paid into the emperor's exchequer.
This sum, Melancthon supposes, amounted annually to Three Tons Of Gold.

[Matthew 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mat 22:22</span></span>

When they had heard these words, they marvelled - And well they might -
never man spake like this man. By this decision, Caesar is satisfied -
he gets his own to the uttermost farthing. God is glorified - his honor
is in every respect secured. And the People are edified - one of the
most difficult questions that could possibly come before them is
answered in such a way as to relieve their consciences, and direct their
conduct. See L'Evangile Medite, and see my discourse entitled, The
Rights of God and Caesar.

it returns to the charge. Jesus and his Gospel give no quarter to vice;
the vicious will give no quarter to him or it.

Raise up seed unto his brother - This law is mentioned [Deu
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005.md). The meaning of the expression
is, that the children produced by this marriage should be reckoned in
the genealogy of the deceased brother, and enjoy his estates. The word
seed should be always translated children or posterity. There is a law
precisely similar to this among the Hindoos.

Seven brethren - It is very likely that the Sadducees increased the
number, merely to make the question the more difficult.

Whose wife shall she be of the seven? - The rabbins have said, That if a
woman have two husbands in this world, she shall have the first only
restored to her in the world to come. Sohar. Genes. fol. 24. The
question put by these bad men is well suited to the mouth of a
libertine. Those who live without God in the world have no other god
than the world; and those who have not that happiness which comes from
the enjoyment of God have no other pleasure than that which comes from
the gratification of sensual appetites. The stream cannot rise higher
than the spring: these men, and their younger brethren, atheists,
deists, and libertines of all sorts, can form no idea of heaven as a
place of blessedness, unless they can hope to find in it the
gratification of their sensual desires. On this very ground Mohammed
built his paradise.

[Matthew 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#029.md)

Ye do err - Or, Ye are deceived - by your impure passions: not knowing
the scriptures, which assert the resurrection: - nor the miraculous
power of God (την δυναμιν του Θεου) by which it is to be effected. In
Avoda Sara, fol. 18, Sanhedrin, fol. 90, it is said: "These are they
which shall have no part in the world to come: Those who say, the Lord
did not come from heaven; and those who say, the resurrection cannot be
proved out of the law."

Their deception appeared in their supposing, that if there were a
resurrection, men and women were to marry and be given in marriage as in
this life; which our Lord shows is not the case: for men and women there
shall be like the angels of God, immortal, and free from all human
passions, and from those propensities which were to continue with them
only during this present state of existence. There shall be no death;
and consequently no need of marriage to maintain the population of the
spiritual world.

Have ye not read - This quotation is taken from [Exo
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#006.md), [Exo
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#016.md); and as the five books of Moses
were the only part of Scripture which the Sadducees acknowledged as
Divine, our Lord, by confuting them from those books, proved the second
part of his assertion, "Ye are ignorant of those very scriptures which
ye profess to hold sacred."

[Matthew 22:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mat 22:32</span></span>

I am the God of Abraham - Let it be observed, that Abraham was dead
upwards of 300 years before these words were spoken to Moses: yet still
God calls himself the God of Abraham, etc. Now Christ properly observes
that God is not the God of the dead, (that word being equal, in the
sense of the Sadducees, to an eternal annihilation), but of the living;
it therefore follows that, if he be the God of Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, these are not dead, but alive; alive with God, though they had
ceased, for some hundreds of years, to exist among mortals. We may see,
from this, that our Lord combats and confutes another opinion of the
Sadducees, viz. that there is neither angel nor spirit; by showing that
the soul is not only immortal, but lives with God, even while the body
is detained in the dust of the earth, which body is afterwards to be
raised to life, and united with its soul by the miraculous power of God,
of which power they showed themselves to be ignorant when they denied
the possibility of a resurrection.

The multitude were astonished at his doctrine - God uses the infidelity
of some for the edification of others. Had no false doctrine been
broached in the world, we had not seen the full evidence of the true
teaching. The opposition of deists and infidels has only served to raise
up men in behalf of the truth of God, who not only have refuted them,
but shown, at the same time, that the sacred testimonies are infinitely
amiable in themselves, and worthy of all acceptation. Truth always gains
by being opposed.

accord, or, for the same purpose; i.e. of ensnaring him in his

A lawyer - Νομικος, a teacher of the law. What is called lawyer, in the
common translation, conveys a wrong idea to most readers: my old MS.
renders the word in the same way I have done. These teachers of the law
were the same as the scribes, or what Dr. Wotton calls letter-men, whom
he supposes to be the same as the Karaites, a sect of the Jews who
rejected all the traditions of the elders, and admitted nothing but the
written word. See Wotton's Mishna, vol. i. p. 78. These are allowed to
have kept more closely to the spiritual meaning of the law and prophets
than the Pharisees did; and hence the question proposed by the lawyer,
(Mark, [Mar 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#028.md), calls him one of
the scribes), or Karaite, was of a more spiritual or refined nature than
any of the preceding.

Which is the great commandment - We see here three kinds of enemies and
false accusers of Christ and his disciples; and three sorts of
accusations brought against them.

1\. The Herodians, or politicians and courtiers, who form their
questions and accusations on the rights of the prince, and matters of
state, [Mat 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#016.md).

2\. The Sadducees, or libertines, who found theirs upon matters of
religion, and articles of faith, which they did not credit, [Mat
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#023.md).

3\. The Pharisees, lawyers, scribes, or Karaites, hypocritical
pretenders to devotion, who found theirs on that vital and practical
godliness (the love of God and man) of which they wished themselves to
be thought the sole proprietors, [Mat
22:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#036.md).

[Matthew 22:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mat 22:37</span></span>

Thou shalt love the Lord - This is a subject of the greatest importance,
and should be well understood, as our Lord shows that the whole of true
religion is comprised in thus loving God and our neighbor.

It may not be unnecessary to inquire into the literal meaning of the
word love. Αγαπη, from αγαπαω, I love, is supposed to be compounded
either of αγαν and ποιειν, to act vehemently or intensely; or, from
αγειν κατα παν, because love is always active, and will act in every
possible way; for he who loves is, with all his affection and desire,
carried forward to the beloved object, in order to possess and enjoy it.
Some derive it from αγαν and παυεσθαι, to be completely at rest, or, to
be intensely satisfied; because he who loves is supremely contented
with, and rests completely satisfied in, that which he loves. Others,
from αγαν and παω, because a person eagerly embraces, and vigorously
holds fast, that which is the object of his love. Lastly, others suppose
it to be compounded of αγαω, I admire, and παυομαι, I rest, because that
which a man loves intensely he rests in, with fixed admiration and
contemplation. So that genuine love changes not, but always abides
steadily attached to that which is loved.

Whatever may be thought of these etymologies, as being either just or
probable, one thing will be evident to all those who know what love
means, that they throw much light upon the subject, and manifest it in a
variety of striking points of view. The ancient author of a MS. Lexicon
in the late French king's library, under the word αγαπη, has the
following definition: ΑσπαϚος προθεσις επι τη φιλια του φιλουμενου -
Σομψυχια. "A pleasing surrender of friendship to a friend: - an identity
or sameness of soul." A sovereign preference given to one above all
others, present or absent: a concentration of all the thoughts and
desires in a single object, which a man prefers to all others. Apply
this definition to the love which God requires of his creatures, and you
will have the most correct view of the subject. Hence it appears that,
by this love, the soul eagerly cleaves to, affectionately admires, and
constantly rests in God, supremely pleased and satisfied with him as its
portion: that it acts from him, as its author; for him, as its master;
and to him, as its end. That, by it, all the powers and faculties of the
mind are concentrated in the Lord of the universe. That, by it, the
whole man is willingly surrendered to the Most High: and that, through
it, an identity, or sameness of spirit with the Lord is acquired - the
man being made a partaker of the Divine nature, having the mind in him
which was in Christ, and thus dwelling in God, and God in him.

But what is implied in loving God with all the heart, soul, mind,
strength, etc., and when may a man be said to do this?

1\. He loves God with all his heart, who loves nothing in comparison of
him, and nothing but in reference to him: - who is ready to give up, do,
or suffer any thing in order to please and glorify him: - who has in his
heart neither love nor hatred, hope nor fear, inclination, nor aversion,
desire, nor delight, but as they relate to God, and are regulated by
him.

2\. He loves God with all his soul, or rather, εν ολη τη ψυχη, with all
his life, who is ready to give up life for his sake - to endure all
sorts of torments, and to be deprived of all kinds of comforts, rather
than dishonor God: - who employs life with all its comforts, and
conveniences, to glorify God in, by, and through all: - to whom life and
death are nothing, but as they come from and lead to God, From this
Divine principle sprang the blood of the martyrs, which became the seed
of the Church. They overcame through the blood of the Lamb, and loved
not their lives unto the death. See [Rev
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#011.md).

3\. He loves God with all his strength ([Mar
12:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#030.md); [Luk
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#027).md) who exerts all the powers of
his body and soul in the service of God: - who, for the glory of his
Maker, spares neither labor nor cost - who sacrifices his time, body,
health, ease, for the honor of God his Divine Master: - who employs in
his service all his goods, his talents, his power, credit, authority,
and influence.

4\. He loves God with all his mind (intellect - διανοια) who applies
himself only to know God, and his holy will: - who receives with
submission, gratitude, and pleasure, the sacred truths which God has
revealed to man: - who studies no art nor science but as far as it is
necessary for the service of God, and uses it at all times to promote
his glory - who forms no projects nor designs but in reference to God
and the interests of mankind: - who banishes from his understanding and
memory every useless, foolish, and dangerous thought, together with
every idea which has any tendency to defile his soul, or turn it for a
moment from the center of eternal repose. In a word, he who sees God in
all things - thinks of him at all times - having his mind continually
fixed upon God, acknowledging him in all his ways - who begins,
continues, and ends all his thoughts, words, and works, to the glory of
his name: - this is the person who loves God with all his heart, life,
strength, and intellect. He is crucified to the world, and the world to
him: he lives, yet not he, but Christ lives in him. He beholds as in a
glass the glory of the Lord, and is changed into the same image from
glory to glory. Simply and constantly looking unto Jesus, the author and
perfecter of his faith, he receives continual supplies of enlightening
and sanctifying grace, and is thus fitted for every good word and work.
O glorious state! far, far, beyond this description! which comprises an
ineffable communion between the ever-blessed Trinity and the soul of
man!

[Matthew 22:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mat 22:38</span></span>

This is the first and great commandment - It is so,

1\. In its antiquity, being as old as the world, and engraven originally
on our very nature.

2\. In dignity; as directly and immediately proceeding front and
referring to God.

3\. In excellence; being the commandment of the new covenant, and the
very spirit of the Divine adoption.

4\. In justice; because it alone renders to God his due, prefers him
before all things, and secures to him his proper rank in relation to
them.

5\. In sufficiency; being in itself capable of making men holy in this
life, and happy in the other.

6\. In fruitfulness; because it is the root of all commandments, and the
fulfilling of the law.

7\. In virtue and efficacy; because by this alone God reigns in the
heart of man, and man is united to God.

8\. In extent; leaving nothing to the creature, which it does not refer
to the Creator.

9\. In necessity; being absolutely indispensable.

10\. In duration; being ever to be continued on earth, and never to be
discontinued in heaven.

[Matthew 22:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">mat 22:39</span></span>

Thou shalt love thy neighbor - The love of our neighbor springs from the
love of God as its source; is found in the love of God as its principle,
pattern, and end; and the love of God is found in the love of our
neighbor, as its effect, representation, and infallible mark. This love
of our neighbor is a love of equity, charity, succor, and benevolence.
We owe to our neighbor what we have a right to expect from him - "Do
unto all men as ye would they should do unto you," is a positive command
of our blessed Savior. By this rule, therefore, we should speak, think,
and write, concerning every soul of man: - put the best construction
upon all the words and actions of our neighbor that they can possibly
bear. By this rule we are taught to bear with, love, and forgive him; to
rejoice in his felicity, mourn in his adversity, desire and delight in
his prosperity, and promote it to the utmost of our power: instruct his
ignorance, help him in his weakness, and risk even our life for his
sake, and for the public good. In a word, we must do every thing in our
power, through all the possible varieties of circumstances, for our
neighbors, which we would wish them to do for us, were our situations
reversed.

This is the religion of Jesus! How happy would Society be, were these
two plain, rational precepts properly observed! Love Me, and love thy
Fellows! Be unutterably happy in me, and be in perfect peace, unanimity,
and love, among yourselves. Great fountain and dispenser of love! fill
thy creation with this sacred principle, for his sake who died for the
salvation of mankind!

On the nature of self-love, see [Mat
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#019.md).

[Matthew 22:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">mat 22:40</span></span>

On these two - hang all the law and the prophets - They are like the
first and last links of a chain, all the intermediate ones depend on
them. True religion begins and ends in love to God and man. These are
the two grand links that unite God to man, man to his fellows, and men
again to God.

Love is the fulfilling of the law, says St. Paul, [Rom
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#010.md); for he who has the love of God
in him delights to obey the Divine precepts, and to do all manner of
kindness to men for God's sake.

[Matthew 22:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mat 22:41</span></span>

While the Pharisees were gathered together - Jesus asks a question in
his turn, utterly to confound them, and to show the people that the
source of all the captious questions of his opponents was their
ignorance of the prophecies relative to the Messiah.

[Matthew 22:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">mat 22:42</span></span>

What think ye of Christ? - Or, What are your thoughts concerning The
Christ - the Messiah; for to this title the emphatic article should
always be added.

Whose son is he? - From what family is he to spring?

They say unto him, The son of David - This was a thing well known among
the Jews, and universally acknowledged, see [Joh
7:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#042.md); and is a most powerful proof
against them that the Messiah is come. Their families are now so
perfectly confounded that they cannot trace back any of their
genealogies with any degree of certainty: nor have they been capable of
ascertaining the different families of their tribes for more than
sixteen hundred years. Why, then, should the spirit of prophecy assert
so often, and in such express terms, that Jesus was to come from the
family of David; if he should only make his appearance when the public
registers were all demolished, and it would be impossible to ascertain
the family? Is it not evident that God designed that the Messiah should
come at a time when the public genealogies might be inspected, to prove
that it was he who was prophesied of, and that no other was to be
expected? The evangelists, Matthew and Luke, were so fully convinced of
the conclusiveness of this proof that they had recourse to the public
registers; and thus proved to the Jews, from their own records, that
Jesus was born of the family mentioned by the prophets. Nor do we find
that a scribe, Pharisee, or any other, ever attempted to invalidate this
proof, though it would have essentially subserved their cause, could
they have done it. But as this has not been done, we may fairly conclude
it was impossible to do it.

[Matthew 22:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">mat 22:43</span></span>

How then doth David in spirit (or by the Spirit - by the inspiration of
the Spirit of God) call him Lord? saying,

[Matthew 22:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">mat 22:44</span></span>

The Lord (יהוה Yeve or Jehovah) said unto my Lord, אדניע Adni or Adonai,
my prop, stay, master, support), Sit thou on my right hand - Take the
place of the greatest eminence and authority. Till I make thine enemies
thy footstool - till I subdue both Jews and Gentiles under thee, and
cause them to acknowledge thee as their sovereign and Lord. This
quotation is taken from [Psa 110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md);
and, from it, these two points are clear:

1\. That David wrote it by the inspiration of God; and

2\. That it is a prophetic declaration of the Messiah.

[Matthew 22:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">mat 22:45</span></span>

How is he his son? - As the Jews did not attempt to deny the conclusion
of our Lord's question, which was, the Messiah is not only the son of
David according to the flesh, but he is the Lord of David according to
his Divine nature, then it is evident they could not. Indeed, there was
no other way of invalidating the argument, but by denying that the
prophecy in question related to Christ: but it seems the prophecy was so
fully and so generally understood to belong to the Messiah that they did
not attempt to do this; for it is immediately added, No man was able to
answer him a word - they were completely nonplussed and confounded.

[Matthew 22:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">mat 22:46</span></span>

Neither durst any - ask him any more questions - "Thus," says Dr.
Wotton, "our Lord put the four great sects of the Jews to silence, in
one day, successively. The Herodians and Pharisees wanted to know
whether they might lawfully pay tribute to Caesar or not. The Sadducees
were inquisitive to know whose wife the woman should be of the seven
brethren, in the resurrection, who had her to wife. Then comes the
scribe, (or karaite), who owned no authority beyond or besides the
written law, and asked which was the great commandment in the law. This
lawyer deserves to be mentioned here, because he not only acquiesced in,
but commended, what our Lord had said in answer to his question."
Wotton's Miscellaneous Discourses, vol. i. p. 78.

The Pharisees and Herodians were defeated, [Mat
22:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#015.md). The Sadducees were
confounded, [Mat 22:29-33](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#029.md). The lawyers
or karaites nonplussed, [Mat 22:37-40](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#037.md).
And the Pharisees, etc., finally routed, [Mat
22:41-46](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#041.md). Thus did the wisdom of God
triumph over the cunning of men.

From this time, we do not find that our Lord was any more troubled with
their captious questions: their whole stock, it appears, was expended,
and now they coolly deliberate on the most effectual way to get him
murdered. He that resists the truth of God is capable of effecting the
worst purpose of Satan.

The very important subjects of this chapter have been so amply discussed
in the notes, and applied so particularly to their spiritual uses, that
it does not appear necessary to add any thing by way of practical
improvement. The explanation of the great command of the law is
particularly recommended to the reader's notice. See on [Mat
22:36-40](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#036) (note.md).
