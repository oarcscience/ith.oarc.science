### [Jeremiah Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 18:0</span></span>

The type of the potter's vessel, and its signification, [Jer
18:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#001.md). The inhabitants of Judah and
Jerusalem exhorted to repentance, [Jer
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#011.md); but on their refusal, (which is
represented to be as unnatural as if a man should prefer the snowy
Lebanon or barren rock to a fruitful plain, or other waters to the cool
stream of the fountain), their destruction is predicted, [Jer
18:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#012.md). In consequence of these
plain reproofs and warnings of Jeremiah, a conspiracy is formed against
him, [Jer 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#018.md). This leads him to
appeal to God for his integrity, [Jer
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#019.md), [Jer
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#020.md); who puts a most dreadful curse
in the mouth of his prophet, strongly indicative of the terrible fate of
his enemies, [Jer 18:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#021.md).

[Jeremiah 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 18:1</span></span>

The word which came to Jeremiah - This discourse is supposed to have
been delivered some time in the reign of Jehoiakim, probably within the
first three years.

[Jeremiah 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 18:2</span></span>

Go down to the potter's house - By this similitude God shows the
absolute state of dependence on himself in which he has placed mankind.
They are as clay in the hands of the potter; and in reference to every
thing here below, he can shape their destinies as he pleases. Again;
though while under the providential care of God they may go morally
astray, and pervert themselves, yet they can be reclaimed by the
almighty and all-wise Operator, and become such vessels as seemeth good
for him to make. In considering this parable we must take heed that in
running parallels we do not destroy the free agency of man, nor disgrace
the goodness and supremacy of God.

[Jeremiah 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 18:3</span></span>

He wrought a work on the wheels - אל האבנים al haabnayim, upon the
stones, the potter's wheel being usually made of such, the spindle of
the moving stone being placed on a stone below, on which it turned, and
supported the stone above, on which the vessel was manufactured, and
which alone had a rotatory motion. The potter's wheel in the present day
seems to differ very little from that which was in use between two and
three thousand years ago.

[Jeremiah 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 18:4</span></span>

The vessel - was marred in the hands of the potter - It did not stand in
the working; it got out of shape; or some gravel or small stone having
been incorporated with the mass of clay, made a breach in that part
where it was found, so that the potter was obliged to knead up the clay
afresh, place it on the wheel, and form it anew; and then it was such a
vessel as seemed good to the potter to make it.

[Jeremiah 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 18:6</span></span>

Cannot I do with you as this potter? - Have I not a right to do with a
people whom I have created as reason and justice may require? If they do
not answer my intentions, may I not reject and destroy them; and act as
this potter, make a new vessel out of that which at first did not
succeed in his hands?

It is generally supposed that St. Paul has made a very different use of
this similitude from that mentioned above. See [Rom
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#020.md), etc. His words are, "Hath not
the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto
honor, and another unto dishonor?" To this every sensible and pious man
will answer, Undoubtedly he has. But would any potter make an
exceedingly fair and good vessel on purpose to dash it to pieces when he
had done? Surely no! And would or could, the God of infinite perfection
and love make millions of immortal souls on purpose for eternal
perdition, as the horrible decree of reprobation states? No! This is a
lie against all the attributes of God. But does not the text state that
he can, out of the same lump, the same mass of human nature, make one
vessel to honor, and another to dishonor? Yes. But the text does not
say, what the horrible decree says, that he makes one part, and indeed
the greater, for eternal perdition. But what then is the meaning of the
text? Why evidently this: As out of the same mass of clay a potter may
make a flagon for the table and a certain utensil for the chamber, the
one for a more honorable, the other for a less honorable use, though
both equally necessary to the owner; so God, out of the same flesh and
blood, may make the tiller of the field and the prophet of the Most
High; the one in a more honorable, the other in a less honorable employ;
yet both equally necessary in the world, and equally capable of bringing
glory to God in their respective places. But if the vessel be marred in
his hand, under his providential and gracious dealings, he may reject it
as he did the Jews, and make another vessel, such as he is pleased with,
of the Gentiles; yet even these marred vessels, the reprobate Jews, are
not finally rejected; for all Israel shall be saved in (through) the
Lord, i.e., Jesus Christ. And should the Gentiles act as the Jews have
done, then they also shall be cut off, and God will call his Church by
another name. See on [Rom 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#022) (note.md)
and below.

[Jeremiah 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 18:7</span></span>

At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, etc. - If that
nation, against whom, etc. - And at what instant, etc. - If it do evil,
etc. - These verses contain what may be called God's decree by which the
whole of his conduct towards man is regulated. If he purpose destruction
against an offending person, if that person repent and turn to God, he
shall live and not die. If he purpose peace and salvation to him that
walketh uprightly, if he turn from God to the world and sin, he shall
die and not live.

[Jeremiah 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 18:12</span></span>

There is no hope - See [Jer 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#025.md).

[Jeremiah 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 18:13</span></span>

The virgin of Israel - Instead of ישראל Yisrael, three of Kennicott's
and De Rossi's MSS., with the Alexandrian copy of the Septuagint, have
ירושלם Yerushalem, Jerusalem.

[Jeremiah 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 18:14</span></span>

Will a man leave the snow of Lebanon - Lebanon was the highest mountain
in Judea. Would any man in his senses abandon a farm that was always
watered by the melted snows of Lebanon, and take a barren rock in its
place? How stupid therefore and absurd are my people, who abandon the
everlasting God for the worship of idols!

[Jeremiah 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 18:16</span></span>

A perpetual hissing - שריקות sherikoth. a shrieking, hissing; an
expression of contempt.

[Jeremiah 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 18:17</span></span>

I will scatter them as with an east wind - It is the property of this
wind, almost every where, to parch up, blast, and destroy grain and
trees, and even cattle and men suffer from it. Hence the old metrical
proverb: -

"When the wind blows from the east, 'Tis good for neither man nor
beast."

[Jeremiah 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 18:18</span></span>

Come, and let us devise devices - Let us form a conspiracy against him,
accuse him of being a false prophet, and a contradicter of the words of
God, for God has promised us protection, and he says we shall be
destroyed, and that God will forsake his people.

Let us smite him with the tongue - On the tongue; so it should be
rendered. Lying and false testimony are punished in the eastern
countries, to the present day, by smiting the person on the mouth with a
strong piece of leather like the sole of a shoe. Sometimes a bodkin is
run through the tongue. Blasphemy, calumny, and cursing of parents, are
usually punished in that way among the Chinese.

[Jeremiah 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 18:20</span></span>

They have digged a pit for my soul - For my life; this they wish to take
away.

Stood before thee to speak good for them - I was their continual
intercessor.

[Jeremiah 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 18:21</span></span>

Therefore deliver up their children - The execrations in these verses
should be considered as simply prophetic declarations of the judgments
which God was about to pour out on them.

If we consider them in their grammatical meaning, then they are not
directions to us to whom our Lawgiver has said, "Love your enemies."
