### [Nehemiah Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#001.md)

[Nehemiah](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">neh 3:0</span></span>

The names of those who rebuilt the walls of Jerusalem; and the part
assigned to each person, vv. 1-32.

[Nehemiah 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 3:1</span></span>

Eliashib the high priest - It was right that the priests should be first
in this holy work; and perhaps the sheep gate which is mentioned here is
that by which the offerings or sacrifices were brought into the temple.

They sanctified it - As they began with the sacred offering as soon as
they got an altar built, it was proper that the gate by which these
sacrifices entered should be consecrated for this purpose, i. e., set
apart, so that it should be for this use only.

[Nehemiah 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">neh 3:3</span></span>

The fish gate - We really know scarcely any thing about these gates -
what they were, why called by these names, or in what part of the wall
situated. All plans of Jerusalem, its temple, walls, and gates, are mere
works of conjecture; and yet how learnedly have some men written on all
these subjects!

[Nehemiah 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">neh 3:7</span></span>

The throne of the governor - His house, and the place where he dispensed
justice and judgment. Previously to the days of Nehemiah, Jerusalem was
governed by a deputy from the Persian king; (see [Neh
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#015).md); but after this time they were
governed by governors and judges chosen from among themselves.

[Nehemiah 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">neh 3:8</span></span>

Goldsmiths - From the remotest period of the history of the Jews they
had artists in all elegant and ornamental trades; and it is also evident
that goldsmiths, apothecaries, and merchants were formed into companies
in the time of Nehemiah.

Apothecaries - Rather such as dealt in drugs, aromatics, spices, etc.,
for embalming, or for furnishing the temple with the incense consumed
there.

[Nehemiah 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">neh 3:9</span></span>

Ruler of the half part of Jerusalem - Probably the city was divided into
two parts; one for Judah, and the other for Benjamin, each having its
proper governor. Rephaiah mentioned here was one of these governors, and
Shallum, mentioned [Neh 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#012.md), was the
other. There were other rulers or governors of particular country or
village districts.

[Nehemiah 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">neh 3:11</span></span>

Repaired the other piece - That which was left by Jedaiah after he had
repaired the wall opposite to his own house. Probably some of the
principal people were obliged to repair those parts of the wall opposite
to their own dwellings. Perhaps this was the case generally.

[Nehemiah 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">neh 3:12</span></span>

The son of Halohesh - Or, the son of the Enchanter: conjectured to be
thus named from having the art to charm serpents.

The ruler of the half part - See on [Neh
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#009) (note.md).

[Nehemiah 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">neh 3:13</span></span>

The inhabitants of Zanoah - This was a town in the tribe of Judah. [Jos
15:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#034.md).

[Nehemiah 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">neh 3:14</span></span>

Beth-haccerem - A village or town in the tribe of Benjamin. See [Jer
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#001.md).

[Nehemiah 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">neh 3:15</span></span>

The pool of Siloah - This is probably the same as that mentioned by the
evangelists.

The stairs that go down from the city of David - Jerusalem being built
on very uneven ground, and some hills being taken within the walls;
there was a necessity that there should be in different places steps by
which they could ascend and descend: probably similar to what we see in
the city of Bristol.

[Nehemiah 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">neh 3:16</span></span>

The pool that was made - Calmet supposes that this was the reservoir
made by Hezekiah, when besieged by Sennacherib, [Ch2
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#004.md).

The house of the mighty - Probably a place where a band of soldiers was
kept, or the city guard.

[Nehemiah 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">neh 3:19</span></span>

The going up to the armoury - This was either a tower that defended the
angle where the two walls met; or the city arsenal, where shields,
spears, etc., were kept to arm the people in time of danger.

[Nehemiah 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">neh 3:20</span></span>

Earnestly repaired - He distinguished himself by his zeal and activity.

[Nehemiah 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">neh 3:22</span></span>

The priests, the men of the plain - Some of the officers of the temple,
particularly the singers, dwelt in the plain country round about
Jerusalem, [Neh 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#028.md); and it is
likely that several of the priests dwelt in the same place.

[Nehemiah 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">neh 3:28</span></span>

The horse gate - The place through which the horses passed in order to
be watered; It was near the temple. Some rabbins suppose that in order
to go to the temple, a person might go on horseback to the place here
referred to, but then was obliged to alight, as a horse could pass no
farther. Horses were never very plentiful in Jerusalem.

[Nehemiah 3:32](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">neh 3:32</span></span>

The goldsmiths and the merchants - The word הצרפים hatstsorephim may
signify smiths, or persons who worked in metals of any kind; but it is
generally understood to mean those who worked in gold. I have already
observed, that the mention of merchants and goldsmiths shows that these
persons were formed into bodies corporate in those ancient times. But
these terms are differently rendered in the versions. The Vulgate is the
same as ours, which probably our translators copied: aurifices et
negociatores. The Syriac is, goldsmiths and druggists. The Arabic,
smelters of metal and porters. The Septuagint, in some copies,
particularly in the Roman edition, and in the Complutensian, Antwerp,
and Paris Polyglots, have οἱ χαλκεις και οἱ μεταβολι, smiths and
merchants; but in other copies, particularly the London Polyglot, for
μεταβολοι we find ῥωποπωλαι, seller of shields. And here the learned
reader will find a double mistake in the London Polyglot, ῥοποπωλαι for
ῥωποπωλαι, and in the Latin version scruta for scuta, neither of which
conveys any sense.
