### [1 Chronicles Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 12:0</span></span>

The different persons, captains, etc., who joined themselves to David at
Ziklag, vv. 1-22. Those who joined him at Hebron, out of the different
tribes; Judah, Simeon, Levi, the house of Aaron, Benjamin, Ephraim,
Manasseh, Issachar, Zebulun, Naphtali, Dan, Asher, Reuben, etc., to the
amount of a hundred and twenty thousand, [Ch1
12:23-37](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#023.md). Their unanimity, and the
provisions they brought for his support, [Ch1
12:38-40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#038.md).

[1 Chronicles 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 12:1</span></span>

Came to David to Ziklag - Achish, king of Gath, had given Ziklag to
David, as a safe retreat from the wrath of Saul.

[1 Chronicles 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 12:8</span></span>

And were as swift as the roes - That swiftness was considered to be a
grand accomplishment in a warrior, appears from all ancient writings
which treat of military affairs.

[1 Chronicles 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch1 12:15</span></span>

In the first month - Perhaps this was the month Nisan, which answers to
a part of our March and April. This was probably before the snows on the
mountains were melted, just as Jordan began to overflow its banks; or if
we allow that it had already overflowed its banks, it made their attempt
more hazardous, and afforded additional proof of their heroism.

[1 Chronicles 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 12:18</span></span>

The spirit came upon Amasai - "The spirit of fortitude clothed Amasai,
the chief of the mighty men; and he answered, For thy sake, O David, are
we come, that we may be with thee, thou son of Jesse.

Prosperity be to thee by night and by day; and prosperity be to thy
helpers; for the Word of the Lord is thy assistant." - T.

[1 Chronicles 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 12:22</span></span>

Like the host of God - "That is, a very numerous army; like the army of
the angel of God." - T.

[1 Chronicles 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch1 12:23</span></span>

And came to David to Hebron - That is, after the death of Ish-bosheth,
Saul's son. See [Sa2 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#005.md).

[1 Chronicles 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ch1 12:27</span></span>

Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites - Abiathar was then high
priest, and Jehoiada captain over the warriors of the house of Aaron.

[1 Chronicles 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">ch1 12:32</span></span>

Children of Issachar - According to the Targum they were all astronomers
and astrologers: "and the sons of Issachar, who had understanding to
know the times, and were skilled in fixing the beginnings of years, the
commencement of months, and the intercalation of months and years;
skillful in the changes of the moon, and in fixing the lunar solemnities
to their proper times; skillful also in the doctrine of the solar
periods; astrologers in signs and stars, that they might show Israel
what to do; and their teachers were two hundred chiefs of the Sanhedrin:
and all their brethren excelled in the words of the law, and were endued
with wisdom, and were obedient to their command." - T. It appears that
in their wisdom, experience, and skill, their brethren had the fullest
confidence; and nothing was done but by their direction and advice.

[1 Chronicles 12:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">ch1 12:39</span></span>

They were with David three days - These were the deputies of the
different people mentioned here: it is not possible that all the
thousands mentioned above could have feasted with David for three days;
and yet it appears there was even of these a great number, for the men
of Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali, who were nearest to this place of
rendezvous, had brought all the necessaries for such a feast. From the
whole it appears most evident that the great majority of the tribes of
Israel wished to see the kingdom confirmed in the hands of David; nor
was there ever in any country a man more worthy of the public choice. As
a statesman, warrior, hero, poet, and divine, he stands unrivalled in
the annals of the world: by him alone were the Israelites raised to a
pitch of the highest splendor; and their name became a terror to their
enemies, and a praise in the earth. But, alas, how are the mighty now
fallen!
