Preface to the First Epistle of John

As the author of this epistle is the same who wrote the gospel, I need
not detain the reader with any particulars of his life, having taken up
the subject pretty much at large in my preface to his gospel, to which I
must refer for that species of information.

Two questions have been urged relative to this epistle, which are very
difficult to be solved:

1\. When was it written?

2\. To whom was it sent?

The precise year it is impossible to determine; but it was probably
written before the destruction of Jerusalem; and perhaps about the year
68 or 69, though some think not before 80. The second question Michaelis
answers thus: -

"This question is still more difficult to decide than the preceding. In
the Latin version it was formerly called The Epistle of St. John to the
Parthians; and this title was adopted by some of the ancient fathers,
and in modern times has been defended by Grotius. But if St. John had
intended this epistle for the use of the Parthians, he would hardly have
written it in Greek, but would have used either the language of the
country, or, if he was unacquainted with it, would have written at least
in Syriac, which was the language of the learned in the Parthian empire,
and especially of the Christians. We know, from the history of Manes,
that even the learned in that country were for the most part
unacquainted with the Greek language; for to Manes, though he united
literature with genius, his adversaries objected that he understood only
the barbarous Syriac. That a Grecian book would not have been understood
in the Parthian empire, appears from what Josephus says in the preface
to his History of the Jewish War, where he declares that a work intended
for Parthian Jews must be written, not in Greek, but Hebrew. However, it
is worth while to examine whence the superscription 'ad Parthos' took
its rise. Whiston conjectures that an ancient Greek superscription of
this epistle was προς παρθενους, (to virgins), because this epistle is
chiefly addressed to uncorrupted Christians, and that this title was
falsely copied προς Παρθαυς, whence was derived the Latin
superscription, 'ad Parthos.' But this conjecture is without foundation;
for since the faithful are not called in a single instance throughout
the whole epistle by the name of παρθενους, it is very improbable that
the title προς παρθενους was ever affixed to it. I would rather suppose,
therefore, that the frequent use in this epistle of the words 'light'
and 'darkness,' which occur in the Persian philosophy, and on the same
occasions as those on which St. John has used them, gave rise to the
opinion that St. John wrote it with a view of correcting the abuses of
the Persian philosophy; whence it was inferred that he designed it for
the use of the Christians in the Parthian empire. That St. John really
designed his epistle as a warning to those Christians who were in danger
of being infected with Zoroastrian principles, is very probable, though
the language of the epistle will not permit us to place St. John's
readers in a country to the east of the Euphrates.

"Lampe, who appeals to Theodoret, contends that it, was not designed for
any particular community, but that it was written for the use of
Christians of every denomination; and this is really the most probable
opinions since the epistle contains no reference to any individual
Church. The only difficulty attending this opinion lies in the name
'epistle,' because the frequent use in an epistle of the terms 'light
and darkness,' taken in the Persian sense of these words, seems to imply
that it was written to persons of a particular description. But if we
call it a treatise, this difficulty will cease; and in fact, the name
'epistle' is improperly applied to it, since it has nothing which
entitles it to this appellation. It does not begin with the salutation
which is used in Greek epistles, and with which St. John himself begins
his two last epistles; nor does it contain any salutations, though they
are found in almost all the epistles of the apostles. It is true that
St. John addresses his readers in the second person; but this mode of
writing is frequently adopted in books, and especially in prefaces: for
instance, in Wolfe's Elements of Mathematics, the reader is addressed
throughout in the second person, I therefore consider that which is
commonly called the First Epistle of St. John as a book or treatise, in
which the apostle declared to the whole world his disapprobation of the
doctrines maintained by Cerinthus and the Gnostics. However, as I do not
think it worth while to dispute about words, I have retained the usual
title, and have called it the First Epistle of St. John.

"That the design of this epistle was to combat the doctrine delivered by
certain false teachers, appears from [Jo1
2:18-26](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#018.md); [Jo1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#007.md); [Jo1
4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001.md) : and what this false doctrine
was may be inferred from the counter doctrine delivered by St. John,
[Jo1 5:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001.md). The apostle here asserts
that Jesus is the Christ,' and that he was the Christ, 'not by water
only, but by water and blood.' Now these words, which are not in
themselves very intelligible, become perfectly clear if we consider them
as opposed to the doctrine of Cerinthus, who asserted that Jesus was by
birth a mere man; but that the Aeon, Christ, descended on him at his
baptism, and left him before his death. But if what St. John says, [Jo1
5:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001.md), was opposed to Cerinthus, the
Antichrists of whom he speaks, [Jo1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#018.md), [Jo1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#019.md), and who, according to [Jo1
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#022.md), denied that Jesus was the
Christ, as also the false prophets, mentioned [Jo1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001.md), [Jo1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#003.md), must be Cerinthians, or at least
Gnostics. That they were neither Jews nor heathens may be inferred from
[Jo1 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#019.md), where St. John says, 'They
went out from us.' Farther, he describes them, [Jo1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#018.md), as persons who had lately
appeared in the world. But this description suits neither Jews nor
heathens, who, when this epistle was written, had not lately begun to
deny that Jesus was the Christ. Lastly, in the same verse, he describes
them as tokens of the last time, saying, 'As ye have heard that
Antichrist shall come, even now there are many Antichrists, whereby we
know that it is the last time.' But this inference could not be drawn
from the refusal of the Jews to acknowledge that Jesus was the Messiah.
Now, as soon as we perceive that the position, 'Jesus is the Christ,' is
a counter position against Cerinthus, we may infer, as I have already
observed, that the Antichrists who denied that Jesus was the Christ, or
who denied that Christ had appeared in the flesh, were Cerinthians; or
perhaps the latter were Docetes. It is, therefore, highly probable that
the whole epistle, which in various places discovers an opposition to
false teachers, was written against Cerinthians, or at least against
Gnostics and Magi. A proposition can never be completely understood,
unless we know the author's design in delivering it. For instance, 'God
is light, and in him is no darkness,' appears to contain a tautology, if
we consider it as a detached dogma; and if it be considered as an
admonitory proposition, it may be thought to contain a severe reproof;
but if we regard it in a polemical view, it will present itself under a
very different form. This epistle abounds with exhortations; but no man
who wishes to understand it will be satisfied without asking the
following questions: Why did St. John give these admonitions? Why has he
so frequently repeated them? Why has he admonished, if he thought
admonition necessary, merely in general terms, to holiness and brotherly
love? And why has he not sometimes descended to particulars, as other
apostles have done? An answer to these questions will throw great light
on the epistle; and this light I will endeavor to procure for the
reader, by pointing out the several propositions which, in my opinion,
are laid down in opposition to Gnostic errors.

"1. In the first chapter the four first verses are opposed to the
following assertion of the Gnostics: 'That the apostles did not deliver
the doctrine of Jesus as they had received it, but made additions to it,
especially in the commandments which were termed legal; whereof they
themselves (the Gnostics) retained the genuine and uncorrupted mystery.'
St. John therefore says: 'That he declared that which was from the
beginning, which he himself had seen and heard;' that is, that he taught
the doctrine of Christ as it was originally delivered, as he had heard
it from Christ's own mouth, whose person he had seen and felt; and that
he made no additions of his own, but only reported as a faithful
witness. In like manner he appeals, [Jo1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013.md), [Jo1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#014.md), to the elder Christians, whom he
calls fathers, 'because they knew him who was from the beginning;' that
is, because they knew how Christ had taught from the beginning; and [Jo1
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#024.md), he says: 'Let that abide in you
which ye have heard from the beginning.' Farther he says, [Jo1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#007.md) : 'Brethren, I write no new
commandment unto you, but an old commandment, which ye had from the
beginning.' In the next verse he adds: 'Again a new commandment I write
unto you, which thing is true in him and in you, because the darkness is
past, and the light now shineth.' Now Christ himself had given his
disciples a commandment which he called a new commandment, and this was,
'that they should love one another.' The term 'new commandment,'
therefore, St. John borrowed from Christ; but in the present instance he
appears to have applied it to a different subject, because the special
command which Christ gave to his disciples, that they should love one
another, and which he called a new commandment, could not well be called
an old commandment, being very different from the general commandment,
that we should love our neighbor. St. John, therefore, very probably
meant that the commandment of love and sanctification was no new
commandment, as the Gnostics contended, but the old commandment which
the Christians had heard from the beginning. It was, indeed, become a
new commandment, in consequence of the false doctrines which then
prevailed; or rather, it appeared to be so, because the Gnostics had
endeavored to banish it from their system of theology. But whether a new
or an old commandment, St. John thought proper to enforce it.

"2. The Gnostics, who contended that those commandments which were legal
were not given by Christ, but were added by the apostles without his
authority, counteracted, by so doing, the whole doctrine of
sanctification. St. John, therefore, devotes the greatest part of his
epistle to the confirmation and enforcement of this doctrine. In [Jo1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005.md), [Jo1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007.md), he asserts, as a principal part
of the message which he had heard from Christ, that no one who does not
walk in the light has fellowship with God. In the three following verses
he limits this proposition in such a manner as was necessary in arguing
with an adversary; and [Jo1 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001.md), [Jo1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#002.md), he removes the objection, that,
according to his doctrine, a Christian who was guilty of wilful sins
lost thereby all hopes of salvation. He then maintains, [Jo1
2:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#003.md), and apparently in allusion to
the word γνωσις, knowledge, the favourite term of the Gnostics, that he
who boasted of profound knowledge, and at the same time rejected the
commandments of Christ, had not a real but only a pretended knowledge;
and that in him only the love of God is perfected, τετελειωται, who
keeps God's word. The expression τετελειωται is a term which was used in
the schools of the philosophers, and applied to the scholars called
esoterici, who had made a considerable progress in the inner school. Now
the Gnostics were, in their own opinion, scholars of this description;
but since they, whose imaginary system of theology annuls the commands
of God, are so far from being perfect that they are not even beginners
in the science, St. John very properly refuses to admit their
pretensions, and opposes to them others who were perfect in a different
way, and who were more justly entitled to the appellation. With respect
to the expressions, 'keeping the commandments of God,' or 'not keeping
his commandments,' it must be observed that, when used in a polemical
work, they denote, not merely the observance or violation of God's
commands in our own practice, but the teaching of others that they are
to be observed or rejected. What St. John says, [Jo1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#007.md), [Jo1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#008.md), has been already explained in the
preceding paragraph.

"The whole of the third chapter, and part of the fourth, is devoted to
the doctrine of sanctification, on which I have to make the following
remarks. When St. John says, [Jo1 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#007.md),
'Let no man deceive you; he who doeth righteousness is righteous,' he
probably intends, not merely to deliver a precept, but to oppose the
doctrine of those who asserted that a man, though he sinned, might be
righteous in respect to his spiritual soul, because sin proceeded only
from the material body. A similar observation may be applied to [Jo1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#004.md) : 'Whosoever committeth sin
transgresseth also the law;' which, considered by itself, appears to be
an identical proposition; but when considered as an assertion opposed to
the Gnostics, it is far from being superfluous, because, evident as it
appears to be, they virtually denied it. From the passage above quoted
from the works of Irenaeus, we have seen that they rejected the legal
commandments as parts of the Christian religion which were not warranted
by the authority of Christ; consequently, they denied that sin was a
transgression of the law. Farther, it was consistent with their
principles to regard sins as diseases; for they believed in a
metempsychosis, and imagined that the souls of men were confined in
their present bodies as in a prison, and as a punishment for having
offended in the region above. According to this system, the violent and
irregular passions of anger, hatred, etc., were tortures for the soul;
they were diseases, but not punishable transgressions of the law. I will
not assert that all who believed in a transmigration of souls argued in
this manner, but some of them certainly did so; and against these it was
not superfluous to write, 'Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also
the law, for sin is the transgression of the law.'

"The love of the brethren, which St. John enforced as a chief
commandment, is generally understood of that special love which Christ
commanded his disciples to have towards each other. But I rather think
that St. John means the love of our neighbor in general, which Christ
commanded, as comprehending the half of the law; for this general love
St. John might very properly call the love of our brother, since God has
created us all, and is our common Father. Besides, as St. John calls
Cain, Abel's brother, he could not intend to signify by this term a
person of the same religious sentiments. Nor would it have been
consistent with candour to have censured the Gnostics for not having
Christian brotherly love towards St. John and other true believers, for
in this particular sense they were not brethren; and St. John himself,
in his second epistle, [Jo2 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#010.md),
forbids the exercise of Christian brotherly love towards those who teach
false doctrines. I believe, therefore, that the brotherly love of which
St. John speaks in the third chapter of this epistle, is not confined to
that special love which we owe to those who are allied to us by
religion, but denotes the love of our neighbor in general. Nor do I
except even [Jo1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#016.md), where some
think that St. John would require too much, if he meant brotherly love
in general, or charity toward all men. But are there not certain cases
in which it is our duty to hazard and even sacrifice our lives, in order
to rescue our neighbor! Is not this duty performed by the soldier? And
is it not performed by him who visits those who are infected with
contagious diseases? It is true that this is not a duty which every man
owes in all cases to his neighbor; but then, on the other hand, is it
not a duty which every man owes to his spiritual brother? Nor was it St.
John's design so much to enforce this duty, and to recommend the
exercise of it, as to argue from the acknowledgment of this duty in
certain cases, to the necessity of performing the less painful duty of
supporting our brethren in distress, by a participation of our temporal
possessions. But though I believe that in the third chapter St. John
speaks of the love of our neighbor in general, I do not mean to affirm
that he nowhere understands that special love which Christians owe one
to another, of which we meet with an instance in [Jo1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001.md), [Jo1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#002.md).

"3. With respect to the moral conduct of the Gnostics, against whom St.
John wrote, we may infer, therefore, that the apostle found more reason
to censure them for their want of charity toward their neighbors, than
for dissoluteness or debauchery. This want of charity they probably
displayed by a hatred of the true believers.

"What St. John says, [Jo1 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#003.md), that
'God's commandments are not grievous,' appears in the clearest light
when we consider it as opposed to the Gnostics, to whom the Divine
commandments, as delivered by the apostles, appeared to be too legal.

"St. John declares, [Jo1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005.md), as the
message which he had heard from Christ, that 'God is light, and in him
is no darkness at all.' Now if this proposition had been then as
generally admitted as it is at present, there could have been no
necessity for declaring it at the very beginning of the epistle, with so
much energy, to be the grand message of Christ. We may reasonably infer,
therefore, that it was opposed to certain persons who delivered a
contrary doctrine. Farther, the words 'light' and 'darkness,' which are
here applied to the Deity in a manner which is not usual in the Bible,
remind us of the technical terms used by the Persian Magi, and
afterwards by the Manicheans. It is true that in the Bible we meet with
the expressions 'works of the light,' 'children of the light,' 'to walk
in the light,' and others of the same kind; but in these instances the
term 'light' is not synonymous with 'holiness;' works of the light
denoting nothing more than works which no man need be ashamed to perform
openly, and in the face of the whole world. This explanation of the word
'light' is inapplicable in the proposition 'God is light;' because there
would be an impropriety in representing God either as fearing or not
fearing to act in the face of the whole world. St. John, therefore, uses
the term 'light' as equivalent to holiness.

"Now, the Gnostics admitted that the supreme Being was perfectly holy
and pure light; but they denied that the supreme Being was the God whom
the Jews and the Christians worshipped. For the Jews and the Christians
worshipped the Creator of the world; and the Gnostics asserted that the
Creator of the world was either a spirit of darkness, or, if he was a
spirit of light, that he was not free from darkness.

"From [Jo1 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#023.md), where St. John says,
that 'he who denies the Son, rejects also the Father,' it appears that
his adversaries did not deny the Father in positive terms, since the
apostle argues only that they virtually did so by denying the Son. Now,
the Gnostics did not positively deny the Father of Christ, whom they
allowed to be the supreme Being, but then they did not allow that he was
the Creator. The terms, therefore, 'God' and the 'Father of Christ,'
though they denote in reality the same person, must not be considered as
having precisely the same import; since the adversaries of St. John
admitted that the Father of Christ was the supreme Being, and pure
light; but denied that the Creator, who is in fact God, was light
without darkness.

"4. In some places, especially [Jo1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#002.md), [Jo1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#003.md), St. John opposes false teachers
of another description, namely, those who denied that Christ was come in
the flesh. Now they who denied this were not Cerinthians, but another
kind of Gnostics, called Docetes. For as, on the one hand, Cerinthus
maintained that Jesus was a mere and therefore real man, the Docetes on
the other hand contended that he was an incorporeal phantom, in which
the Aeon, Christ, or Divine nature, presented itself to mankind. [Jo1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001.md) : 'Our hands have handled,'
appears likewise to be opposed to this error of the Docetes.

"The doctrines which St. John has delivered in this epistle he has not
supported, either by arguments drawn from reason, or by quotations from
the Old Testament; for neither of them are necessary, since the bare
assertion of an apostle of Christ is sufficient authority. It is true
that, in one respect, this epistle has less energy than St. John's
gospel, because in his gospel he warrants his doctrines by the speeches
of Christ. But then, on the other hand, St. John declares in this
epistle, [Jo1 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#024.md); [Jo1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#004.md); [Jo1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#014.md), [Jo1
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#016.md), that God sent his Spirit to the
apostolic Church, and heard their prayers. And it is evident that St.
John alludes to the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost, and to the
miraculous powers obtained by prayer.

"The close of this epistle, 'Keep yourselves from idols,' has no
immediate connection with the preceding discourse. I am therefore in
doubt whether St; John meant to warn his readers against taking part in
heathen sacrifices, which was allowed by these Gnostics, who are called
Nicolaitans in the Apocalypse; or whether he meant to describe the
system of the Gnostics in general as a system of idolatry, which in fact
it was."

Dr. Macknight has some judicious observations on the authenticity of
this epistle, from the similarity of the style to that of the gospel of
John.

"The authenticity of any ancient writing is established, first, by the
testimony of contemporary and succeeding authors, whose works have come
down to us, and who speak of that writing as known to be the work of the
person whose name it bears. Secondly, by the suitableness of the things
contained in such writing to the character and circumstances of its
supposed author, and by the similarity of its style to the style of the
other acknowledged writings of that author. The former of these proofs
is called the external evidence of the authenticity of a writing; The
latter, its internal evidence. When these two kinds of evidence are
found accompanying any writing, they render its genuineness indubitable.

"The external evidence of the authenticity of John's first epistle has
been amply detailed by Dr. Lardner, who shows that the earliest and best
Christian writers have all, with one consent, and without any
hesitation, ascribed the first epistle to him. And their testimony is
confirmed by this circumstance, that the Syriac translator, who omitted
the Second Epistle of Peter, the Second and Third Epistles of John, and
the Epistle of Jude, because some doubts were entertained concerning
them in the first age, or perhaps because they had not come to his
knowledge, has translated John's first epistle, as an apostolical
writing of which there never was any doubt in that or in any other
Christian Church.

"In this preface, therefore, we shall state the internal evidence of the
authenticity of John's first epistle, by showing, first, that, in
respect of its matter, and, secondly, in respect of its style, it is
perfectly suitable to the character and circumstances of its supposed
author. In respect of the matter or subject of the epistle under
consideration, the writer of it has discovered himself to be John the
apostle, by introducing a number of sentiments and expressions found in
the gospel, which all Christians from the beginning have acknowledged to
be the work of John the apostle.

water and of the Spirit. [Jo1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#001.md).
Behold how great love the Father hath bestowed on us, that we should be
called the sons of God! [Joh 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012.md). To
them he gave power to become the sons of God, even to them who believe
on his name. [Jo1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002.md). We shall be
like him, for we shall see him as he is. [Joh
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#024.md). Be with me where I am, that
they may behold my glory. [Jo1 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#008.md). He
who worketh sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the
beginning. [Joh 8:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044.md). Ye are of your
father the devil; he was a murderer from the beginning. [Jo1
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#013.md). Do not wonder, my brethren, that
the world hateth you. [Joh 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#020.md). If
they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you. [Jo1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#009.md). By this the love of God was
manifested, that God sent his Son, the only begotten, into the world,
that we might live through him. [Joh
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016.md). God so loved the world that he
gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him might not
perish, but have eternal life. [Jo1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#012.md). No man hath seen God at any
time. [Joh 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018.md). No man hath seen God
at any time. [Jo1 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#013.md). These things I
have written to you, who believe on the name of the Son of God, that ye
may know that ye have eternal life; and that ye may believe in the name
of the Son of God. [Joh 20:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#031.md). These
things are written that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the
Son of God, and that believing ye might have life through his name. [Jo1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#014.md). If we ask any thing according to
his will, he heareth us. [Joh 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#014.md).
If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it. [Jo1
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#020.md). The Son of God is come, and hath
given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are
in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God,
and eternal life. [Joh 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#002.md). Thou hast
given him power over all flesh, that he might give eternal life to as
many as thou hast given him.

[Joh 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003.md) : And this is the eternal
life, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ
whom thou hast sent.

"From the above comparison of the first epistle of John with his gospel,
there appears such an exact agreement of sentiment in the two writings,
that no reader who is capable of discerning what is peculiar in an
author's turn of thinking, can entertain the least doubt of their being
the productions of one and the same writer. Farther, since John has not
mentioned his own name in his gospel, the want of his name in the
epistle is no proof that it was not written by him; but rather a
presumption that it is his; especially as he has sufficiently discovered
himself to be an apostle, by affirming, in the beginning of the epistle,
that he was an eye and an ear witness of the things he has written
concerning the living word.

"The style of this epistle being the same with the style of the gospel
of John, it is, by that internal mark likewise, denoted to be his
writing. In his gospel, John does not content himself with simply
affirming or denying a thing; but, to strengthen his affirmation, he
denies the contrary. In like manner, to strengthen his denial of a
thing, he affirms its contrary. See [Joh
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#020.md); [Joh
3:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#036.md); [Joh
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022.md). The same manner of expressing
things strongly, is found in this epistle; for example, [Jo1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#004.md) : 'He who saith, I have known him,
and doth not keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in
him.' [Jo1 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#027.md) : 'The same unction
teacheth you concerning all things, and is truth, and is no lie.' [Jo1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#002.md) : 'Every spirit which confesseth
that Jesus Christ hath come in the flesh, is from God.' [Jo1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#003.md) : 'And every spirit which doth not
confess that Jesus Christ hath come in the flesh, is not from God.'

"In his gospel likewise, John, to express things emphatically,
frequently uses the demonstrative pronoun this. [Joh
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#019.md); Αὑτη· 'This is the testimony.'
[Joh 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019.md); Αὑτη· 'This is the
condemnation, that light,' etc. [Joh
6:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#029.md) : Τουτο· 'This is the work of
God.' [Joh 6:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#040.md) : Τουτο· 'This is the
will of him.' [Joh 6:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#050.md) : Οὑτος· 'This
is the bread which cometh down from heaven.' [Joh
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003.md) : Αὑτη· 'This is the eternal
life.' In the epistle the same emphatical manner of expression is found,
[Jo1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005.md); [Jo1
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#025.md) : 'This is the promise.' [Jo1
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#023.md) : Αὑτη· 'This is the
commandment.' [Jo1 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#003.md) : Αὑτη· 'This
is the love of God.' [Jo1 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004.md) : 'This
is the victory.' [Jo1 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#006.md) : Οὑτος·
'This is he who came by water.' [Jo1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#014.md) : Αὑτη· 'This is the boldness
which we have with him.'

"Such is the internal evidence on which all Christians, from the
beginning, have received the First Epistle of John as really written by
him, and of Divine authority, although his name is not mentioned in the
inscription, nor in any part of the epistle."

On the term epistle, as applied to this work of St. John, it may be
necessary to make a few remarks. There is properly nothing of the
epistolary style in this work: it is addressed neither to any particular
person, nor to any Church.

The writer does not mention himself either in the beginning or ending;
and, although this can be no objection against its authenticity, yet it
is some proof that the work was never intended to be considered in the
light of an epistle.

1\. Is it a tract or dissertation upon the more sublime parts of
Christianity.

2\. Is it a polemical discourse against heretics, particularly the
Gnostics, or some of their teachers, who were disturbing the Churches
where John dwelt.

3\. Is it a sermon, the subject of which is God's love to man in the
mission of Jesus Christ; from which our obligations to love and serve
him are particularly inferred.

4\. Or is it a collection of Christian aphorisms, made by John himself;
and put together as they occurred to his mind, without any intended
order or method. Much might be said on all these heads of inquiry; and
the issue would be, that the idea of its being an epistle of any kind
must be relinquished; and yet epistle is its general denomination
through all antiquity.

It is a matter, however, of little importance what its title may be, or
to what species of literary composition it belongs; while we know that
it is the genuine work of St. John; of the holiest man who ever
breathed; of one who was most intimately acquainted with the doctrine
and mind of his Lord; of one who was admitted to the closest fellowship
with his Savior; and who has treated of the deepest things that can be
experienced or comprehended in the Christian life.

As to distinct heads of discourse, it does not appear to me that any
were intended by the apostle; he wrote just as the subjects occurred to
his mind, or rather as the Holy Spirit gave him utterance; and, although
technical order is not here to be expected, yet nothing like disorder or
confusion can be found in the whole work.

As Professor Michaelis has considered it in the light of a polemical
treatise, written against the Gnostics, and other false teachers of that
time, I have thought it right to give his view of the work considered in
this light; but as I, in general, pursue another plan of interpretation
in the notes, I have inserted his elucidations in the preceding pages of
this preface.

On the controverted text of the three heavenly Witnesses I have said
what truth and a deep and thorough examination of the subject have
obliged me to say. I am satisfied that it is not genuine, though the
doctrine in behalf of which it has been originally introduced into the
epistle is a doctrine of the highest importance, and most positively
revealed in various parts both of the Old and New Testament. The stress
which has been laid on the testimony of this text in behalf of the
doctrine of the Trinity has done much evil; for when its own
authenticity has come to be critically examined, and has been found to
rest on no sure foundation, the adversaries of the doctrine itself have
thought they had full cause for triumph, and have in effect said, "If
this text be to the epistle, and to the doctrine in question, what the
sun is in the world, what the heart is in man, and what the needle is in
the mariner's compass, then the doctrine is spurious, for the text is a
most manifest forgery." I would just observe, that incautious or feeble
defences of any doctrine do not affect the doctrine itself but in the
view of superficial minds. The proof that this text is an interpolation
which, first existing as an illustrative marginal note, has afterwards
been unfortunately introduced into the text, has "demolished no strong
hold of the orthodox, has taken away no pillar from the Christian
faith." The grand defences of the doctrine of the Trinity, brought down
to us from the highest Christian antiquity, stand still in all their
force; not one of them was built upon this text, because the text, as a
supposed part of St. John's work, did not then exist; therefore neither
evidence, prop, nor pillar of the grand doctrine is injured. We have
what we ever had in this respect, and we may make the same illustrating
use of the words in reference to this doctrine which many Latin writers,
since the time of St. Cyprian, made; and which was proper enough in its
own place, but became useless when incorporated with the sure sayings of
God.

No man, it is hoped, will be so obstinate, perverse, or disingenuous, as
to say or insinuate that the man who gives up this text is unsound in
the faith; it would be as reasonable to assert, on the other hand, that
he who understands the mass of evidence that is against the authenticity
of this verse, and who nevertheless will contend for its continuance in
the sacred canon, is a Deist in his heart, and endeavors to discredit
the truth by mixing it with error and falsehood. Those whose doubts are
not removed by the dissertation at the end of his epistle had better
read the late Professor Porson's Answer to Dean Travis, where it is
presumed they will receive the fullest satisfaction.
