### [Genesis Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 24:0</span></span>

Abraham, being solicitous to get his son Isaac property married, calls
his confidential servant, probably Eliezer, and makes him swear that he
will not take a wife for Isaac from among the Canaanites, [Gen
24:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#001.md), but from among his own
kindred, [Gen 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#004.md). The servant
proposes certain difficulties, [Gen
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#005.md), which Abraham removes by giving
him the strongest assurances of God's direction in the business, [Gen
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#006.md), [Gen
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#007.md), and then specifies the
conditions of the oath, [Gen 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#008.md). The
form of the oath itself, [Gen 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#009.md).
The servant makes preparations for his journey, and sets out for
Mesopotamia, the residence of Abraham's kindred, [Gen
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#010.md). Arrives at a well near to the
place, [Gen 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#011.md). His prayer to God,
[Gen 24:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#012.md). Rebekah, the daughter
of Bethuel, son of Nahor, Abraham's brother, comes to the well to draw
water, [Gen 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#015.md). She is described,
[Gen 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#016.md). Conversation between her
and Abraham's servant, in which every thing took place according to his
prayer to God, [Gen 24:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#017.md). He makes
her presents, and learns whose daughter she is, [Gen
24:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#022.md). She invites him to her
father's house, [Gen 24:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#025.md). He returns
thanks to God for having thus far given him a prosperous journey, [Gen
24:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#026.md), [Gen
24:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#027.md). Rebekah runs home and informs
her family, [Gen 24:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#028.md); on which her
brother Laban comes out, and invites the servant home, [Gen
24:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#029.md). His reception, [Gen
24:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#032.md), [Gen
24:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#033.md). Tells his errand, [Gen
24:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#034.md), and how he had proceeded in
executing the trust reposed in him, [Gen
24:35-48](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#035.md). Requests an answer, [Gen
24:49](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#049.md). The family of Rebekah consent
that she should become the wife of Isaac, [Gen
24:50](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#050.md), [Gen
24:51](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#051.md). The servant worships God, [Gen
24:52](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#052.md), and gives presents to Milcah,
Laban, and Rebekah, [Gen 24:53](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#053.md). He
requests to be dismissed, [Gen
24:54-56](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#054.md). Rebekah, being consulted,
consents to go, [Gen 24:57](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#057.md), [Gen
24:58](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#058.md). She is accompanied by her
nurse, [Gen 24:59](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#059.md); and having received
the blessing of her parents and relatives, [Gen
24:60](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#060.md), she departs with the servant of
Abraham, [Gen 24:61](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#061.md). They are met by
Isaac, who was on an evening walk for the purpose of meditation, [Gen
24:62-65](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#062.md). The servant relates to Isaac
all that he had done, [Gen 24:66](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#066.md).
Isaac and Rebekah are married, [Gen
24:67](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#067.md).

[Genesis 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 24:1</span></span>

And Abraham was old - He was now about one hundred and forty years of
age, and consequently Isaac was forty, being born when his father was
one hundred years old. See [Gen 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#005.md);
[Gen 25:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#020.md).

[Genesis 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 24:2</span></span>

Eldest servant - As this eldest servant is stated to have been the ruler
over all that he had, it is very likely that Eliezer is meant. See [Gen
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#002.md), [Gen
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#003.md).

Put, I pray thee, thy hand - See note on [Gen
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#009.md).

[Genesis 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 24:3</span></span>

I will make thee swear - See note on [Gen
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#009.md).

Of the Canaanites - Because these had already been devoted to slavery,
etc., and it would have been utterly inconsistent as well with prudence
as with the design of God to have united the child and heir of the
promise with one who was under a curse, though that curse might be
considered to be only of a political nature. See the curse of Canaan,
[Gen 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#025) (note.md).

[Genesis 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 24:4</span></span>

My country - Mesopotamia, called here Abraham's country, because it was
the place where the family of Haran, his brother, had settled; and where
himself had remained a considerable time with his father Terah. In this
family, as well as in that of Nahor, the true religion had been in some
sort preserved, though afterwards considerably corrupted; see [Gen
31:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#019.md).

And take a wife unto my son - A young man in Bengal is precisely in the
same circumstances as Isaac; he has nothing to do in the choice of a
wife; parents employ others to seek wives for their sons. Those who
leave their homes in search of employment always marry their children in
their own country, and among their acquaintance at home; never among the
people with whom they reside. In Asiatic countries this custom has
prevailed from the infancy of the human race. See Ward's Hindoo Customs.

[Genesis 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 24:5</span></span>

Peradventure the woman will not be willing - We may see, says Calmet, by
this and other passages of Scripture, [Jos
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#018.md), what the sentiments of the
ancients were relative to an oath. They believed they were bound
precisely by what was spoken, and had no liberty to interpret the
intentions of those to whom the oath was made.

[Genesis 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 24:7</span></span>

The Lord God, etc. - He expresses the strongest confidence in God, that
the great designs for which he had brought him from his own kindred to
propagate the true religion in the earth would be accomplished; and that
therefore, when earthly instruments failed, heavenly ones should be
employed. He shall send his angel, probably meaning the Angel of the
Covenant, of whom see [Gen 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#007.md).

[Genesis 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 24:9</span></span>

Put his hand under the thigh of Abraham - This form of swearing has
greatly puzzled the commentators; but it is useless to detail opinions
which I neither believe myself, nor would wish my readers to credit. I
believe the true sense is given in the Targum of Jonathan ben Uzziel,
and that called the Jerusalem Targum. In the former it is said, Put now
thy hand בגזית מהולתי bigzirath mehulathi, in sectione circumcisionis
meoe; in the latter תחות ירך קימי techoth yerech keyami, sub femore
foederis mei. When we put the circumstances mentioned in this and the
third verse together, we shall find that they fully express the ancient
method of binding by oath in such transactions as had a religious
tendency. 1. The rite or ceremony used on the occasion: the person
binding himself put his hand under the thigh of the person to whom he
was to be bound; i.e., he put his hand on the part that bore the mark of
circumcision, the sign of God's covenant, which is tantamount to our
kissing the book, or laying the hand upon the New Testament or covenant
of our Lord Jesus Christ. 2. The form of the oath itself: the person
swore by Jehovah, the God of heaven and the God of the earth. Three
essential attributes of God are here mentioned:

1\. His self-existence and eternity in the name Jehovah.

2\. His dominion of glory and blessedness in the kingdom of heaven.

3\. His providence and bounty in the earth.

The meaning of the oath seems to be this: "As God is unchangeable in his
nature and purposes, so shall I be in this engagement, under the penalty
of forfeiting all expectation of temporal prosperity, the benefits of
the mystical covenant, and future glory." An oath of this kind, taken at
such a time, and on such an occasion, can never be deemed irreligious or
profane. Thou shalt swear by his name - shalt acknowledge and bind
thyself unto the true God, as the just Judge of thy motives and actions,
is a command of the Most High; and such an oath as the above is at once
(on such an occasion) both proper and rational. The person binding
himself proposes for a pattern the unchangeable and just God; and as He
is the avenger of wrong and the punisher of falsehood, and has all power
in the heavens and in the earth, so he can punish perjury by privation
of spiritual and temporal blessings, by the loss of life, and by
inflicting the perdition due to ungodly men, among whom liars and
perjured persons occupy the most distinguished rank. Our ideas of
delicacy may revolt from the rite used on this occasion; but, when the
nature of the covenant is considered, of which circumcision was the
sign, we shall at once perceive that this rite could not be used without
producing sentiments of reverence and godly fear, as the contracting
party must know that the God of this covenant was a consuming fire.

[Genesis 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 24:10</span></span>

Took ten camels - It appears that Abraham had left the whole management
of this business to the discretion of his servant, to take with him what
retinue and what dowry he pleased; for it is added, All the goods of his
master were in his hand; and in those times it was customary to give a
dowry for a wife, and not to receive one with her.

[Genesis 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 24:11</span></span>

He made his camels to kneel down - To rest themselves, or lie down, as
the Septuagint has very properly expressed it, Και εκοιμισε τας
καμηλους.

The time that women go out to draw water - In Bengal it is the universal
practice for the women to go to pools and rivers to fetch water.
Companies of four, six, ten, or more, may be seen in every town daily
going to fetch water, with the pitchers resting upon their sides; and,
on their return from bathing, women frequently bring water home - Ward.

[Genesis 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 24:12</span></span>

And he said, O Lord God, etc. - "The conduct of this servant," says Dr.
Dodd, "appears no less pious than rational. By supplicating for a sign,
he acknowledges God to be the great superintendent and director of the
universe, and of that event in particular; and at the same time, by
asking a natural sign, such as betokened humanity, condescension, and
other qualities which promised a discreet and virtuous wife, he puts his
prayer upon such a discreet, rational footing, as to be a proper example
for all to imitate who would not tempt the providence of God, by
expecting extraordinary signs to be given them for the determination of
cases which they are capable of deciding by a proper use of their
rational faculties." This is all very good; but certainly the case
referred to here is such a one as required especial direction from God;
a case which no use of the rational faculties, without Divine influence,
could be sufficient to determine. It is easy to run into extremes, and
it is very natural so to do. In all things the assistance and blessing
of God are necessary, even where human strength and wisdom have the
fullest and freest sphere of action; but there are numberless cases, of
infinite consequence to man, where his strength and prudence can be of
little or no avail, and where the God of all grace must work all things
according to the counsel of his own will. To expect the accomplishment
of any good end, without a proper use of the means, is the most
reprehensible enthusiasm; and to suppose that any good can be done or
procured without the blessing and mercy of God, merely because proper
means are used, is not less reprehensible. Plan, scheme, and labor like
Eliezer, and then, by earnest faith and prayer, commit the whole to the
direction and blessing of God.

[Genesis 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 24:15</span></span>

Behold, Rebekah came out - How admirably had the providence of God
adapted every circumstance to the necessity of the case, and so as in
the most punctual manner to answer the prayer which his servant had
offered up!

[Genesis 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gen 24:19</span></span>

I will draw water for thy camels also - Had Rebekah done no more than
Eliezer had prayed for, we might have supposed that she acted not as a
free agent, but was impelled to it by the absolutely controlling power
of God; but as she exceeds all that was requested, we see that it sprang
from her native benevolence, and sets her conduct in the most amiable
point of view.

[Genesis 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 24:21</span></span>

The man, wondering at her - And he was so lost in wonder and
astonishment at her simplicity, innocence, and benevolence, that he
permitted this delicate female to draw water for ten camels, without
ever attempting to afford her any kind of assistance! I know not which
to admire most, the benevolence and condescension of Rebekah, or the
cold and apparently stupid indifference of the servant of Abraham.
Surely they are both of an uncommon cast.

[Genesis 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 24:22</span></span>

The man took a golden ear-ring - נזם זהב nezem zahab. That this could
not be an ear-ring is very probable from its being in the singular
number. The margin calls it a jewel for the forehead; but it most likely
means a jewel for the nose, or nose-ring, which is in universal use
through all parts of Arabia and Persia, particularly among young women.
They are generally worn in the left nostril. The word is very properly
translated επιρῥινιον, an ornament for the nose, by Symmachus.

Half a shekel - For the weight of a shekel, See note [Gen
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#016.md).

And two bracelets - ושני צמידים usheney tsemidim. As tsemidim comes from
צמד tsamad, to join or couple together, it may very properly mean
bracelets, or whatever may clasp round the arms or legs; for rings and
ornaments are worn round both by females in India and Persia. The small
part of the leg is generally decorated in this way, and so is the whole
arm from the shoulder to the wrist. As these tsemidim were given to
Rebekah for her hands, it sufficiently distinguishes them from a similar
ornament used for the ankles.

In different parts of the sacred writings there are allusions to
ornaments of various kinds still in use in different Asiatic countries.
They are of seven different sorts. 1. for the forehead; 2. for the nose;
3. for the ears; 4. for the arms; 5. for the fingers; 6. for the neck
and breast; 7. for the ankles. See [Gen
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#022.md), [Gen
24:47](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#047.md); also [Eze
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#012.md); [Pro
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#022.md); [Isa
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#021.md); [Gen
35:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#004.md); [Exo
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#002.md), [Exo
32:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#003.md); [Job
42:11](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#011.md); [Jdg
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#024.md). The principal female ornaments
are enumerated in the third chapter of Isaiah, which are very nearly the
same that are in use in Persia and India to the present time.

[Genesis 24:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gen 24:26</span></span>

Bowed down his head, and worshipped - Two acts of adoration are
mentioned here;

1\. Bowing the head, יקד yikkod; and

2\. Prostration upon the earth, וישתחו vaiyishtaehu.

The bowing of the head was to Rebekah, to return her thanks for her kind
invitation. The prostration was to Jehovah, in gratitude for the success
with which he had favored him.

[Genesis 24:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">gen 24:27</span></span>

The Lord led me - By desire of his master he went out on this journey;
and as he acknowledged God in all his ways, the Lord directed all his
steps.

[Genesis 24:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">gen 24:28</span></span>

Her mother's house - Some have conjectured from this that her father
Bethuel was dead; and the person called Bethuel, [Gen
24:50](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#050.md), was a younger brother. This is
possible, but the mother's house might be mentioned were even the father
alive; for in Asiatic countries the women have apartments entirely
separate from those of the men, in which their little children and
grown-up daughters reside with them. This was probably the case here,
though it is very likely that Bethuel was dead, as the whole business
appears to be conducted by Rebekah's brothers.

[Genesis 24:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">gen 24:31</span></span>

Thou blessed of the Lord - Probably a usual mode of wishing prosperity,
as he that is blessed of the Lord is worthy of all respect; for,
enjoying the Divine favor, he is in possession of the sum of happiness.

[Genesis 24:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">gen 24:32</span></span>

Provender for the camels - These were the first objects of his care; for
a good man is merciful to his beast.

Water to wash his feet - Thus it thus appears that he had servants with
him; and as the fatigues of the journey must have fallen as heavily upon
them as upon himself, so we find no distinction made, but water is
provided to wash their feet also.

[Genesis 24:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">gen 24:33</span></span>

I will not eat until I have told - In Hindoostan it is not unusual for a
Brahmin to enter a house and sit down, and when meat is offered, refuse
to eat till he has obtained the object of his errand. Here is a servant
who had his master's interest more at heart than his own. He refuses to
take even necessary refreshment till he knows whether he is likely to
accomplish the object of his journey. Did not our blessed Lord allude to
the conduct of Abraham's servant, [Joh
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#034.md) : My meat is to do the will of
him that sent me, and to finish his work?

[Genesis 24:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">gen 24:36</span></span>

Unto him hath he given all that he hath - He has made Isaac his sole
heir. These things appear to be spoken to show the relatives of Rebekah
that his master's son was a proper match for her; for even in those
primitive times there was regard had to the suitableness of station and
rank in life, as well as of education, in order to render a match
comfortable. Persons of dissimilar habits, as well as of dissimilar
religious principles, are never likely to be very happy in a married
life. Even the poor and the rich may better meet together in matrimonial
alliances than the religious and the profane, the well-bred and the
vulgar. A person may be unequally yoked in a great variety of ways: Bear
ye one another's burdens is the command of God; but where there is
unsuitableness in the dispositions, education, mental capacity, etc., of
the persons, then one side is obliged to bear the whole burden, and
endless dissatisfaction is the result. See at the end, [Gen
24:67](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#067) (note.md).

[Genesis 24:42](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">gen 24:42</span></span>

O Lord God of my master - As Abraham was the friend of God, Eliezer
makes use of this to give weight and consequence to his petitions.

[Genesis 24:43](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">gen 24:43</span></span>

When the virgin - העלמה haalmah, from עלם alam, to hide, cover, or
conceal; a pure virgin, a woman not uncovered, and in this respect still
concealed from man. The same as בתולה bethulah, [Gen
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#016.md), which, from the explanation
there given, incontestably means a virgin in the proper sense of the
word - a young woman, not that is covered or kept at home, the common
gloss, but who was not uncovered in the delicate sense in which the
Scripture uses this word. See this interpretation vindicated on [Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014) (note.md).

[Genesis 24:45](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">gen 24:45</span></span>

Before I had done speaking in mine heart - So we find that the whole of
this prayer, so circumstantially related [Gen
24:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#012.md), and again [Gen
24:42-44](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#042.md), was mental, and heard only
by that God to whom it was directed. It would have been improper to have
used public prayer on the occasion, as his servants could have felt no
particular interest in the accomplishment of his petitions, because they
were not concerned in them, having none of the responsibility of this
mission.

[Genesis 24:49](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">gen 24:49</span></span>

That I may turn to the right hand or to the left - That is, That I may
go elsewhere and seek a proper match for the son of my master. Some have
imagined that Eliezer intimated by these expressions that if he did not
succeed in obtaining Rebekah, he would go and seek for a wife either
among the descendants of Ishmael or the descendants of Lot. This
interpretation is fanciful.

[Genesis 24:50](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">gen 24:50</span></span>

Laban and Bethuel - These seem both to be brothers, of whom Laban was
the eldest and chief; for the opinion of Josephus appears to be very
correct, viz., that Bethuel, the father, had been some time dead. See
note [Gen 24:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#028.md).

Bad or good - We can neither speak for nor against; it seems to be
entirely the work of God, and we cordially submit: consult Rebekah; if
she be willing, take her and go. See note [Gen
24:58](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#058.md).

[Genesis 24:53](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">gen 24:53</span></span>

Jewels of silver, and jewels of gold - The word כלי keley, which we here
translate jewels signifies properly vessels or instruments; and those
presented by Eliezer might have been of various kinds. What he had given
before, [Gen 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#022.md), was in token of
respect, what he gave now appears to have been in the way of dowry.

Precious things - מגדנת migdanoth. This word is used to express
exquisite fruits or delicacies, [Deu
33:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#013.md); precious plants or flowers,
[Sol 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#016.md); [Sol
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#013.md). But it may mean gifts in
general, though rather of an inferior kind to those mentioned above.

And they did eat and drink - When Eliezer had got a favorable answer,
then he and his servants sat down to meat; this he had refused to do
till he had told his message, [Gen
24:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#033.md).

Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten - The original
is very abrupt and obscure, because we are not acquainted with the
precise meaning of the form of speech which is here used; ימים או עשור
yamim o asor Days or Ten, probably meaning a year or ten months, as the
margin reads it, or a week or ten days. This latter is the most likely
sense, as there would be no propriety after having given their consent
that she should go, in detaining her for a year or ten months. In
matters of simple phraseology, or in those which concern peculiar
customs, the Septuagint translation, especially in the Pentateuch, where
it is most accurate and pure, may be considered a legitimate judge; this
translation renders the words ἡμερας ὡσει δεκα, about ten days.
Houbigant contends strongly that instead of the words ימים או עשור yamim
o asor, days or ten, we should read חדש ימים chodesh yamim, a month of
days, i.e., a full month; without which emendation he asserts, locus
explicari non possit, "the passage cannot be explained." This emendation
is supported by the Syriac version, which reads here yerach yomin, a
month of days, or a full month. The reader may adopt the Syriac or the
Septuagint, as he judges best.

Wilt thou go with this man? - So it appears it was left ultimately to
the choice of Rebekah whether she would accept the proposals now made to
her, unless we suppose that the question meant, Wilt thou go
immediately, or stay with us a month longer? She said, I will go - It
fully appears to be the will of God that it should be so, and I consent.
This at once determined the whole business.

And her nurse - Whose name, we learn from [Gen
35:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#008.md), was Deborah, and who, as a
second mother, was deemed proper to accompany Rebekah. This was a
measure dictated by good sense and prudence. Rebekah had other female
attendants. See [Gen 24:61](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#061.md).

[Genesis 24:60](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#060.md)

Be thou the mother of thousands of millions - לאלפי רבבה lealphey
rebabah, for thousands ten thousand, or for myriads of thousands, a
large family being ever considered, in ancient times, as a proof of the
peculiar blessing and favor of God. Similar addresses to a daughter,
when she is going from her father's house to live with her husband, are
very common among the Hindoos; such as, "Be thou the mother of a son,"
"Be thou the wife of a king," etc. See Ward.

And Isaac came - Concerning this well see [Gen
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#013.md), [Gen
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#014.md), etc. As it appears from [Gen
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#011.md), that Isaac dwelt at the well
Lahai-roi, it has been conjectured that he had now come on a visit to
his aged father at Beersheba, where he waited in expectation of his
bride.

For he dwelt in the south country - The southern part of the land of
Canaan. See [Gen 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#009.md).

Isaac went out to meditate - לשוח lasuach, to bend down the body, or the
mind, or both. He was probably in deep thought, with his eyes fixed upon
the ground. What the subject of his meditation was it is useless to
inquire; he was a pious man, and could not be triflingly employed.

She took a veil - הצעיף hatstsaaif. This is the first time this word
occurs, and it is of doubtful signification; but most agree to render it
a veil or a cloak. The former is the most likely, as it was generally
used by women in the east as a sign of chastity, modesty, and
subjection.

[Genesis 24:67](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#067.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_067">gen 24:67</span></span>

Sarah's tent - Sarah being dead, her tent became now appropriated to the
use of Rebekah.

And took Rebekah, etc. - After what form this was done we are not told;
or whether there was any form used on the occasion, more than solemnly
receiving her as the person whom God had chosen to be his wife; for it
appears from [Gen 24:66](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#066.md) that the
servant told him all the especial providential circumstances which had
marked his journey. The primitive form of marriage we have already seen,
[Gen 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#023.md), [Gen
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#024.md), which, it is likely, as far as
form was attended to, was that which was commonly used in all the
patriarchal times.

In this chapter we have an affecting and edifying display of that
providence by which God disposes and governs the affairs of the
universe, descending to the minutest particulars, and managing the great
whole by directing and influencing all its parts. This particular or
especial providence we see is not confined to work by general laws; it
is wise and intelligent, for it is the mind, the will, and energy of
God; it steps out of common ways, and takes particular directions, as
endlessly varied human necessities may need, or the establishment and
maintenance of godliness in the earth may require. What a history of
providential occurrences, coming all in answer to the prayer and faith
of a simple, humble individual, does this chapter exhibit!

As Abraham's servant has God's glory only in view in the errand on which
he is going, he may well expect the Divine direction. See with what
simplicity and confidence he prays to God! He even prescribes the way in
which the Divine choice and approbation shall be made known; and God
honors the purity of his motives and his pious faith, by giving him
precisely the answer he wished. How honorable in the sight of God is
simplicity of heart! It has nothing to fear, and all good to hope for;
whereas a spirit warped by self-interest and worldly views is always
uncertain and agitated, as it is ever seeking that from its own
counsels, projects, and schemes, which should be sought in God alone. In
every place the upright man meets with his God; his heart acknowledges
his Maker, and his Maker acknowledges him; for such a one the whole
economy of providence and grace is ever at work.

Abraham's solicitude to get a suitable wife for his son is worthy of the
most serious regard. He was well aware that if Isaac formed a
matrimonial alliance with the Canaanites it might be ruinous to his
piety, and prevent the dissemination of the true religion; therefore he
binds his most trusty servant by a solemn oath not to take a wife for
his son from the daughters of Canaan, but from his own kindred, among
whom the knowledge of the true God was best preserved. Others had
different rays of the light of truth, but Abraham's family alone had The
truth; and to the descendants of this family were the promises made.

How careful should parents be to procure alliances for their children
with those who fear God, as so much of the peace and comfort of the
children, and the happiness of their posterity, depend on this
circumstance! But alas! how many sacrifice the comfort and salvation of
their offspring at the shrine of Mammon! If they can procure rich
husbands and wives for their daughters and sons, then all, in their
apprehension, is well. Marriages of this kind may be considered as mere
bargain and sale; for there is scarcely ever any reference to God or
eternity in them. The Divine institution of marriage is left out of
sight; and the persons are united, not properly to each other, in the
love, fear, and according to the ordinance of God, but they are wedded
to so many thousand pounds sterling, and to so many houses, fields, etc.
Thus like goes to like, metal to metal, earth to earth. Marriages formed
on such principles are mere licensed adulteries. Let such contractors
hear these awful words of God: "Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye
not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God?" [Jam
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#004.md). See note on [Gen
24:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#036.md).

Although under the patriarchal dispensation parents had a kind of
absolute authority over their children, and might dispose of them as
they pleased in general cases, yet it appears that in matrimonial
connections they were under no compulsion. The suitable person was
pointed out and recommended; but it does not appear that children were
forced, against the whole tide of their affections, to take those
persons who were the objects of the parent's choice. Wilt thou go with
this man? was, in all likelihood, deemed essential to the completion of
the contract; and by the answer, I will go, was the contract fully
ratified. Thus the persons were ultimately left to their own choice,
though the most prudent and proper means were no doubt used in order to
direct and fix it. Whether this was precisely the plan followed in
primitive times we cannot absolutely say: they were times of great
simplicity; and probably connections on the mere principle of affection,
independently of all other considerations, seldom existed. And it must
be allowed that matches formed on the sole principle of convenience
might as well be formed by the parents as by any others; and in Asiatic
countries it was generally so, for there the female seldom presumes to
have a choice of her own.

In all cases of this kind the child should invariably consult the
experience and wisdom of the parents; and the parents should ever pay
much respect to the feelings of the child, nor oppose an alliance which
may be in all other respects suitable, because there may be a lack of
property on one side of the intended match. If parents would proceed in
this way, God would pour his blessing on their seed, and his Spirit upon
their offspring.
