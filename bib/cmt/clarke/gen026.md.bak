### [Genesis Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 26:0</span></span>

A famine in the land obliges Isaac to leave Beer-sheba and go to Gerar,
v. 1. God appears to him, and warns him not to go to Egypt, v. 2. Renews
the promises to him which he had made to his father Abraham, vv. 3-5.
Isaac dwells at Gerar, v. 6. Being questioned concerning Rebekah, and
fearing to lose his life on her account, he calls her his sister, v. 7.
Abimelech the king discovers, by certain familiarities which he had
noticed between Isaac and Rebekah, that she was his wife, v. 8. Calls
Isaac and reproaches him for his insincerity, vv. 9, 10. He gives a
strict command to all his people not to molest either Isaac or his wife,
v. 11. Isaac applies himself to husbandry and breeding of cattle, and
has a great increase, vv. 12-14. Is envied by the Philistines, who stop
up the wells he had dug, v. 15. Is desired by Abimelech to remove, v.
16. He obeys, and fixes his tent in the valley of Gerar, v. 17. Opens
the wells dug in the days of Abraham, which the Philistines had stopped
up, v. 18. Digs the well, [Eze
19:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#001.md), 20; and the well Sitnah, [Eze
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#021.md); and the well Rehoboth, [Eze
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#022.md). Returns to Beer-sheba, [Eze
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#023.md). God appears to him, and renews
his promises, [Eze 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#024.md). He builds an
altar there, pitches his tent, and digs a well, [Eze
20:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#025.md). Abimelech, Ahuzzath, and
Phichol, visit him, [Eze 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#026.md). Isaac
accuses them of unkindness, [Eze
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#027.md). They beg him to make a covenant
with them, [Eze 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#028.md), [Eze
20:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#029.md). He makes them a feast, and they
bind themselves to each other by an oath, [Eze
20:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#030.md), [Eze
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#031.md). The well dug by Isaac's
servants ([Gen 26:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#025).md) called Shebah,
[Gen 26:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#033.md). Esau, at forty years of
age, marries two wives of the Hittites, [Gen
26:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#034.md), at which Isaac and Rebekah are
grieved, [Gen 26:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#035.md).

[Genesis 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 26:1</span></span>

There was a famine - When this happened we cannot tell; it appears to
have been after the death of Abraham. Concerning the first famine, see
[Gen 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#010.md).

Abimelech - As we know not the time when the famine happened, so we
cannot tell whether this was the same Abimelech, Phichol, etc., which
are mentioned [Gen 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#001.md), [Gen
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#002.md), etc., or the sons or other
descendants of these persons.

[Genesis 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 26:2</span></span>

Go not down into Egypt - As Abraham had taken refuge in that country, it
is probable that Isaac was preparing to go thither also; and God,
foreseeing that he would there meet with trials, etc., which might prove
fatal to his peace or to his piety, warns him not to fulfill his
intention.

[Genesis 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 26:3</span></span>

Sojourn in this land - In Gerar, whither he had gone, [Gen
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#001.md), and where we find he settled,
[Gen 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#006.md), though the land of Canaan
in general might be here intended. That there were serious and important
reasons why Isaac should not go to Egypt, we may be fully assured,
though they be not assigned here; it is probable that even Isaac himself
was not informed why he should not go down to Egypt. I have already
supposed that God saw trials in his way which he might not have been
able to bear. While a man acknowledges God in all his ways, he will
direct all his steps, though he may not choose to give him the reasons
of the workings of his providence. Abraham might go safely to Egypt,
Isaac might not; in firmness and decision of character there was a wide
difference between the two men.

[Genesis 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 26:4</span></span>

I will make thy seed - as the stars of heaven - A promise often repeated
to Abraham, and which has been most amply fulfilled both in its literal
and spiritual sense.

[Genesis 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 26:5</span></span>

Abraham obeyed my voice - מימרי meimeri, my Word. See [Gen
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#001.md).

My charge - משמרתי mishmarti, from שמר shamar, he kept, observed, etc.,
the ordinances or appointments of God. These were always of two kinds:

1\. Such as tended to promote moral improvement, the increase of piety,
the improvement of the age, etc. And

2\. Such as were typical of the promised seed, and the salvation which
was to come by him.

For commandments, statutes, etc., the reader is particularly desired to
refer to [Lev 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#015.md), etc., where these
things are all explained in the alphabetical order of the Hebrew words.

[Genesis 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 26:7</span></span>

He said, She is my sister - It is very strange that in the same place,
and in similar circumstances, Isaac should have denied his wife,
precisely as his father had done before him! It is natural to ask, Did
Abraham never mention this circumstance to his son? Probably be did not,
as he was justly ashamed of his weakness on the occasion - the only blot
in his character; the son, therefore, not being forewarned, was not
armed against the temptation. It may not be well in general for parents
to tell their children of their former failings or vices, as this might
lessen their authority or respect, and the children might make a bad use
of it in extenuation of their own sins. But there are certain cases,
which, from the nature of their circumstances, may often occur, where a
candid acknowledgment, with suitable advice, may prevent those children
from repeating the evil; but this should be done with great delicacy and
caution, lest even the advice itself should serve as an incentive to the
evil. I had not known lust, says St. Paul, if the law had not said, Thou
shalt not covet. Isaac could not say of Rebekah, as Abraham had done of
Sarah, She is my sister; in the case of Abraham this was literally true;
it was not so in the case of Isaac, for Rebekah was only his cousin.
Besides, though relatives, in the Jewish forms of speaking, are often
called brothers and sisters, and the thing may be perfectly proper when
this use of the terms is generally known and allowed, yet nothing of
this kind can be pleaded here in behalf of Isaac; for he intended that
the Gerarites should understand him in the proper sense of the term, and
consequently have no suspicion that she was his wife. We have already
seen that the proper definition of a lie is any word spoken with the
intention to deceive. See [Gen 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#012.md).

[Genesis 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 26:8</span></span>

Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife - Whatever may be the precise
meaning of the word, it evidently implies that there were liberties
taken and freedom used on the occasion, which were not lawful but
between man and wife.

[Genesis 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 26:10</span></span>

Thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us - It is likely that
Abimelech might have had some knowledge of God's intentions concerning
the family of Abraham, and that it must be kept free from all impure and
alien mixtures; and that consequently, had he or any of his people taken
Rebekah, the Divine judgment might have fallen upon the land. Abimelech
was a good and holy man; and he appears to have considered adultery as a
grievous and destructive crime.

[Genesis 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 26:11</span></span>

He that toucheth - He who injures Isaac or defiles Rebekah shall
certainly die for it. Death was the punishment for adultery among the
Canaanites, Philistines, and Hebrews. See [Gen
38:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#024.md).

[Genesis 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 26:12</span></span>

Isaac sowed in that land - Being now perfectly free from the fear of
evil, he betakes himself to agricultural and pastoral pursuits, in which
he has the especial blessing of God, so that his property becomes
greatly increased.

A hundred-fold - מאה שערים, meah shearim, literally, "A hundred-fold of
barley;" and so the Septuagint, ἑκατοστευουσαν κριθην. Perhaps such a
crop of this grain was a rare occurrence in Gerar. The words, however,
may be taken in a general way, as signifying a very great increase; so
they are used by our Lord in the parable of the sower.

[Genesis 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 26:13</span></span>

The man waxed great - There is a strange and observable recurrence of
the same term in the original: ויגדל האיש וילך הלוך וגדל עד כי גדל מאד
vaiyigdal haish vaiyelech haloch vegadel ad ki gadal meod, And the man
was Great; and he went, going on, and was Great, until that he was
exceeding Great. How simple is this language, and yet how forcible!

[Genesis 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 26:14</span></span>

He had possession of flocks - He who blessed him in the increase of his
fields blessed him also in the increase of his flocks; and as he had
extensive possessions, so he must have many hands to manage such
concerns: therefore it is added, he had great store of servants - he had
many domestics, some born in his house, and others purchased by his
money.

[Genesis 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 26:15</span></span>

For all the wells - the Philistines had stopped them - In such countries
a good well was a great acquisition; and hence in predatory wars it was
usual for either party to fill the wells with earth or sand, in order to
distress the enemy. The filling up the wells in this case was a most
unprincipled transaction, as they had pledged themselves to Abraham, by
a solemn oath, not to injure each other in this or any other respect.
See [Gen 21:25-31](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#025.md).

[Genesis 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 26:16</span></span>

Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we - This is the first
instance on record of what was termed among the Greeks ostracism; i.e.,
the banishment of a person from the state, of whose power, influence, or
riches, the people were jealous. There is a remarkable saying of Bacon
on this subject, which seems to intimate that he had this very
circumstance under his eye: "Public envy is an ostracism that eclipseth
men when they grow too great." On this same principle Pharaoh oppressed
the Israelites. The Philistines appear to have been jealous of Isaac's
growing prosperity, and to have considered it, not as a due reward of
his industry and holiness, but as their individual loss, as though his
gain was at their expense; therefore they resolved to drive him out, and
take his well-cultivated ground, etc., to themselves, and compelled
Abimelech to dismiss him, who gave this reason for it, עצמת ממנו atsamta
mimmennu, Thou hast obtained much wealth among us, and my people are
envious of thee. Is not this the better translation? for it can hardly
be supposed that Isaac was "mightier" than the king of whole tribes.

[Genesis 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 26:18</span></span>

In the days of Abraham - Instead of בימי bimey, in the days, Houbigant
contends we should read עבדי abdey, servants. Isaac dug again the wells
which the servants of Abraham his father had dug. This reading is
supported by the Samaritan, Septuagint, Syriac, and Vulgate; and it is
probably the true one.

[Genesis 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gen 26:19</span></span>

A well of springing water - באר מים חיים beer mayim chaiyim, A well of
living waters. This is the oriental phrase for a spring, and this is its
meaning both in the Old and New Testaments: [Lev
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#005.md), [Lev
14:50](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#050.md); [Lev
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#030.md); [Num
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#017.md); [Sol
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#015.md). See also [Joh
4:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#010.md); [Joh
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#038.md); [Rev
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#006.md); [Rev
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#001.md). And by these scriptures we find
that an unfailing spring was an emblem of the graces and influences of
the Spirit of God.

[Genesis 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 26:21</span></span>

They dug another well - Never did any man more implicitly follow the
Divine command, Resist not evil, than Isaac; whenever he found that his
work was likely to be a subject of strife and contention, he gave place,
and rather chose to suffer wrong than to have his own peace of mind
disturbed. Thus he overcame evil with good.

[Genesis 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gen 26:24</span></span>

The Lord appeared unto him - He needed especial encouragement when
insulted and outraged by the Philistines; for having returned to the
place where his noble father had lately died, the remembrance of his
wrongs, and the remembrance of his loss, could not fail to afflict his
mind; and God immediately appears to comfort and support him in his
trials, by a renewal of all his promises.

[Genesis 26:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">gen 26:25</span></span>

Builded an altar there - That he might have a place for God's worship,
as well as a place for himself and family to dwell in.

And called upon the name of the Lord - And invoked in the name of
Jehovah. See note on [Gen 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#008.md); See
note on [Gen 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#015.md).

[Genesis 26:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gen 26:26</span></span>

Abimelech went to him - When a man's ways please God, he makes even his
enemies to be at peace with him; so Isaac experienced on this occasion.
Whether this was the same Abimelech and Phichol mentioned [Gen
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#022.md), we cannot tell, it is possible
both might have been now alive, provided we suppose them young in the
days of Abraham; but it is more likely that Abimelech was a general name
of the Gerarite kings, and that Phichol was a name of office.

Ahuzzath - The Targum translates this word a company, not considering it
as a proper name: "Abimelech and Phichol came with a company of their
friends." The Septuagint calls him Οχοζαθ ὁ νυμφαγωγος, Ochozath, the
paranymph, he who conducts the bride to the bridegroom's house. Could we
depend on the correctness of this version, we might draw the following
curious conclusions from it:

1\. That this was the son of that Abimelech the friend of Abraham.

2\. That he had been lately married, and on this journey brings with him
his confidential friend, to whom he had lately entrusted the care of his
spouse.

[Genesis 26:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">gen 26:27</span></span>

Seeing ye hate me - He was justified in thinking thus, because if they
did not injure him, they had connived at their servants doing it.

[Genesis 26:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">gen 26:28</span></span>

Let there be now an oath betwixt us - Let us make a covenant by which we
shall be mutually bound, and let it be ratified in the most solemn
manner.

[Genesis 26:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">gen 26:30</span></span>

He made them a feast - Probably on the sacrifice that was offered on the
occasion of making this covenant. This was a common custom.

[Genesis 26:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">gen 26:31</span></span>

They rose up be times - Early rising was general among the primitive
inhabitants of the world, and this was one cause which contributed
greatly to their health and longevity.

[Genesis 26:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">gen 26:33</span></span>

He called it Shebah - This was probably the same well which was called
Beersheba in the time of Abraham, which the Philistines had filled up,
and which the servants of Isaac had reopened. The same name is therefore
given to it which it had before, with the addition of the emphatic
letter ה he, by which its signification became extended, so that now it
signified not merely an oath or full, but satisfaction and abundance.

The name of the city is Beer-sheba - This name was given to it a hundred
years before this time; but as the well from which it had this name
originally was closed up by the Philistines, probably the name of the
place was abolished with the well; when therefore Isaac reopened the
well, he restored the ancient name of the place.

[Genesis 26:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">gen 26:34</span></span>

He took to wife - the daughter, etc. - It is very likely that the wives
taken by Esau were daughters of chiefs among the Hittites, and by this
union he sought to increase and strengthen his secular power and
influence.

[Genesis 26:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">gen 26:35</span></span>

Which were a grief of mind - Not the marriage, though that was improper,
but the persons; they, by their perverse and evil ways, brought
bitterness into the hearts of Isaac and Rebekah. The Targum of Jonathan
ben Uzziel, and that of Jerusalem, say they were addicted to idol
worship, and rebelled against and would not hearken to the instructions
either of Isaac or Rebekah. From Canaanites a different conduct could
not be reasonably expected. Esau was far from being spiritual, and his
wives were wholly carnal.

The same reflections which were suggested by Abraham's conduct in
denying his wife in Egypt and Gerar, will apply to that of Isaac; but
the case of Isaac was much less excusable than that of Abraham. The
latter told no falsity; he only through fear suppressed a part of the
truth.

1\. A good man has a right to expect God's blessing on his honest
industry. Isaac sowed, and received a hundred-fold, and he had
possession of flocks, etc., for the Lord blessed him. Worldly men, if
they pray at all, ask for temporal things: "What shall we eat? what
shall we drink? and wherewithal shall we be clothed?" Most of the truly
religious people go into another extreme; they forget the body, and ask
only for the soul! and yet there are "things requisite and necessary as
well for the body as the soul," and things which are only at God's
disposal. The body lives for the soul's sake; its life and comfort are
in many respects essentially requisite to the salvation of the soul; and
therefore the things necessary for its support should be earnestly asked
from the God of all grace, the Father of bounty and providence. Ye have
not because ye ask not, may be said to many poor, afflicted religious
people; and they are afraid to ask lest it should appear mercenary, or
that they sought their portion in this life. They should be better
taught. Surely to none of these will God give a stone if they ask bread:
he who is so liberal of his heavenly blessings will not withhold earthly
ones, which are of infinitely less consequence. Reader, expect God's
blessing on thy honest industry; pray for it, and believe that God does
not love thee less, who hast taken refuge in the same hope, than he
loved Isaac. Plead not only his promises, but plead on the precedents he
has set before thee. "Lord, thou didst so and so to Abraham, to Isaac,
to Jacob, and to others who trusted in thee; bless my field, bless my
flocks, prosper my labor, that I may be able to provide things honest in
the sight of all men, and have something to dispense to those who are in
want." And will not God hear such prayers? Yea, and answer them too, for
he does not willingly afflict the children of men. And we may rest
assured that there is more affliction and poverty in the world than
either the justice or providence of God requires. There are, however,
many who owe their poverty to their want of diligence and economy; they
sink down into indolence, and forget that word, Whatsoever thy hand
findeth to do, do it with thy might; nor do they consider that by
idleness a man is clothed with rags. Be diligent in business and fervent
in spirit, and God will withhold from thee no manner of thing that is
good.

2\. From many examples we find that the wealth of the primitive
inhabitants of the world did not consist in gold, silver, or precious
stones, but principally in flocks of useful cattle, and the produce of
the field. With precious metals and precious stones they were not
unacquainted, and the former were sometimes used in purchases, as we
have already seen in the case of Abraham buying a field from the
children of Heth. But the blessings which God promises are such as
spring from the soil. Isaac sowed in the land, and had possessions of
flocks and herds, and great store of servants, [Gen
26:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#012.md). Commerce, by which nations
and individuals so suddenly rise and as suddenly fall, had not been then
invented; every man was obliged to acquire property by honest and
persevering labor, or be destitute. Lucky hits, fortunate speculations,
and adventurous risks, could then have no place; the field must be
tilled, the herds watched and fed, and the proper seasons for ploughing,
sowing, reaping, and laying up, be carefully regarded and improved. No
man, therefore, could grow rich by accident. Isaac waxed great and went
forward, and grew until he became very great, [Gen
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#013.md). Speculation was of no use, for
it could have no object; and consequently many incitements to knavery
and to idleness, that bane of the physical and moral health of the body
and soul of man, could not show themselves. Happy times! when every man
wrought with his hands, and God particularly blessed his honest
industry. As he had no luxuries, he had no unnatural and factitious
wants, few diseases, and a long life.

O fortunatos nimium, sua si bona norint, Agricolas!

O thrice happy husbandmen! did they but know their own mercies.

But has not what is termed commerce produced the reverse of all this? A
few are speculators, and the many are comparatively slaves; and slaves,
not to enrich themselves, (this is impossible), but to enrich the
speculators and adventurers by whom they are employed. Even the farmers
become, at least partially, commercial men; and the soil, the fruitful
parent of natural wealth, is comparatively disregarded: the consequence
is, that the misery of the many, and the luxury of the few, increase;
and from both these spring, on the one hand, pride, insolence, contempt
of the poor, contempt of God's holy word and commandments, with the long
catalogue of crimes which proceed from pampered appetites and unsubdued
passions: and on the other, murmuring, repining, discontent, and often
insubordination and revolt, the most fell and most destructive of all
the evils that can degrade and curse civil society. Hence wars,
fightings, and revolutions of states, and public calamities of all
kinds. Bad as the world and the times are, men have made them much worse
by their unnatural methods of providing for the support of life. When
shall men learn that even this is but a subordinate pursuit; and that
the cultivator. of the soul in the knowledge, love, and obedience of
God, is essentially necessary, not only to future glory, but to present
happiness?
