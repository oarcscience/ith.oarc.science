### [Isaiah Chapter 64](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 64:0</span></span>

The whole of this chapter, which is very pathetic and tender, may be
considered as a formulary of prayer and humiliation intended for the
Jews in order to their conversion, [Isa
64:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001.md).

[Isaiah 64:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 64:1</span></span>

O that thou wouldest rend the heavens - This seems to allude to the
wonderful manifestation of God upon Mount Sinai.

[Isaiah 64:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 64:2</span></span>

As when the melting fire burneth "As the fire kindleth the dry fuel" -
המסים hamasim. "It means dry stubble, and the root is המס hamas, "says
Rabbi Jonah, apud Sal ben Belec in loc. Which is approved by Schultens,
Orig. Hebrews p. 30.

"The fire kindling the stubble does not seem like enough to the melting
of the mountains to be brought as a simile to it. What if thus? -

'That the mountains might flow down at thy presence!

As the fire of things smelted burneth,

As the fire causeth the waters to boil - '

There is no doubt of the Hebrew words of the second line bearing that
version." - Dr. Jubb.

I submit these different interpretations to the reader's judgment. For
my own part I am inclined to think that the text is much corrupted in
this place. The ancient Versions have not the least traces of either of
the above interpretations. The Septuagint and Syriac agree exactly
together in rendering this line by, "As the wax melted before the fire,"
which can by no means be reconciled with the present text. The Vulgate,
for המסים hamasim, read ימסו yemasu.

That the nations - For גוים goyim, the nations, four MSS. (one of them
ancient) have הרים harim, the mountains. - L.

[Isaiah 64:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 64:4</span></span>

For since the beginning of the world men have not heard "For never have
men heard" - St. Paul is generally supposed to have quoted this passage
of Isaiah, [Co1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009.md); and Clemens
Romanus in his first epistle has made the same quotation, very nearly in
the same words with the apostle. But the citation is so very different
both from the Hebrew text and the version of the Septuagint, that it
seems very difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile them by any
literal emendation, without going beyond the bounds of temperate
criticism. One clause, "neither hath it entered into the heart of man,"
(which, by the way, is a phrase purely Hebrew, עלה על לב alah al leb,
and should seem to belong to the prophet), is wholly left out; and
another is repeated without force or propriety; viz., "nor perceived by
the ear," after, "never have heard:" and the sense and expression of the
apostle is far preferable to that of the Hebrew text. Under these
difficulties I am at a loss what to do better, than to offer to the
reader this, perhaps disagreeable, alternative: either to consider the
Hebrew text and Septuagint in this place as wilfully disguised and
corrupted by the Jews; of which practice in regard to other quotations
in the New Testament from the Old, they lie under strong suspicions,
(see Dr. Owen on the version of the Septuagint, sect. vi.-ix.); or to
look upon St. Paul's quotation as not made from Isaiah, but from one or
other of the two apocryphal books, entitled, The Ascension of Esaiah,
and the Apocalypse of Elias, in both of which this passage was found;
and the apostle is by some supposed in other places to have quoted such
apocryphal writings. As the first of these conclusions will perhaps not
easily be admitted by many, so I must fairly warn my readers that the
second is treated by Jerome as little better than heresy. See his
comment on this place of Isaiah. - L. I would read the whole verse thus;
"Yea, from the time of old they have not heard, they have not hearkened
to, an eye hath not seen a God besides thee. He shall work for that one
that waiteth for him." This I really think on the whole to be the best
translation of the original.

The variations on this place are as follows: for שמעו shameu, they have
heard, a MS. and the Septuagint read שמענו shamanu, we have heard: for
the second לא lo, not, sixty-nine MSS. and four editions have ולא velo,
and not, and the Syriac, Chaldee, and Vulgate. And so ועין veayin, and
eye, Septuagint and Syriac. את eth, the, (emphatic), is added before
אלהים Elohim, God, in MS. Bodleian. למחכי limechakkey, to them that
wait, plural, two MSS. and all the ancient Versions. - L.

[Isaiah 64:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 64:5</span></span>

Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness "Thou meetest
with joy those who work righteousness" - The Syriac reads פוגע אתה שש
בעשי poga attah shesh baashi, as above.

In those is continuance, and we shall be saved "Because of our deeds,
for we have been rebellious" - בהם עולם ונושע bahem olam venivvashea. I
am fully persuaded that these words as they stand in the present Hebrew
text are utterly unintelligible; there is no doubt of the meaning of
each word separately; but put together they make no sense at all. I
conclude, therefore, that the copy has suffered by mistakes of
transcribers in this place. The corruption is of long standing, for the
ancient interpreters were as much at a loss for the meaning as the
moderns, and give nothing satisfactory. The Septuagint render these
words by δια τουτο επλανηθημεν, therefore we have erred: they seem to
have read עליהם נפשע aleyhem niphsha, without helping the sense. In this
difficulty what remains but to have recourse to conjecture? Archbishop
Secker was dissatisfied with the present reading: he proposed הבט עלינו
ונושע hebet aleynu venivvashea; "look upon us, and we shall, or that we
may, be saved:" which gives a very good sense, but seems to have no
sufficient foundation. Besides, the word ונושע venivvashea, which is
attended with great difficulties, seems to be corrupted as well as the
two preceding; and the true reading of it is, I think, given by the
Septuagint, ונפשע veniphsha, επλανηθημεν, we have erred, (so they render
the verb פשע pasha, [Isa 46:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#008.md), and
[Eze 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#012).md), parallel to ונחטא
vannecheta, ἡμαρτομεν, we have sinned. For בהם עולם bahem olam, which
means nothing, I would propose המעללינו hammaaleleynu, "because of our
deeds;" which I presume was first altered to במעלליהם bemaaleleyhem, an
easy and common mistake of the third person plural of the pronoun for
the first, (see note on [Isa 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#002).md),
and then with some farther alteration to בהם עולם behem olam. The עליהם
aleyhem, which the Septuagint probably found in their copy, seems to be
a remnant of במעלליהם bemaaleleyhem.

This, it may be said, is imposing your sense upon the prophet. It may be
so; for perhaps these may not be the very words of the prophet: but
however it is better than to impose upon him what makes no sense at all;
as they generally do, who pretend to render such corrupted passages. For
instance, our own translators:" in those is continuance, and we shall be
saved:" in those in whom, or what? There is no antecedent to the
relative. "In the ways of God," say some: "with our fathers," says
Vitringa, joining it in construction with the verb, קעפת katsaphta,
"thou hast been angry with them, our fathers;" and putting ונחטא
vannecheta, "for we have sinned," in a parenthesis. But there has not
been any mention of our fathers: and the whole sentence, thus disposed,
is utterly discordant from the Hebrew idiom and construction. In those
is continuance; עולם olam means a destined but hidden and unknown
portion of time; but cannot mean continuation of time, or continuance,
as it is here rendered. Such forced interpretations are equally
conjectural with the boldest critical emendation; and generally have
this farther disadvantage, that they are altogether unworthy of the
sacred writers. - L.

Coverdale renders the passage thus: -

But lo, thou art angrie, for we offende, and have been ever in synne;
and there is not one whole.

This is, I am afraid, making a sense.

After all that this very learned prelate has done to reduce these words
to sense and meaning, I am afraid we are still far from the prophet's
mind. Probably בהם bahem, in them, refers to דרכיך deracheycha, thy
ways, above. עולם olam may be rendered of old, or during the whole of
the Jewish economy; and ונושע venivvashea, "and shall we be saved?"
Thus: - Thou art wroth, for we have sinned in them (thy ways) of old;
and can we be saved? For we are all as an unclean thing, etc.

[Isaiah 64:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 64:6</span></span>

As filthy rags - עדים iddim. Rab. Mosheh ben Maimon interpretatur עדים
iddim, vestes quibus mulier se abstergit post congressum cum marito suo.
Alii pannus menstruatus. Alii panni mulieris parientis. - And we ben
made as unclene alle we: and as the cloth of the woman rooten blode
flowing, all our rigtwisnesses. - Old MS. Bible. If preachers knew
properly the meaning of this word, would they make such a liberal use of
it in their public ministry? And why should any use a word, the meaning
of which he does not understand? How many in the congregation blush for
the incautious man and his "filthy rags!"

[Isaiah 64:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 64:7</span></span>

There is none - Twelve MSS. have אין ein, without the conjunction ו vau
prefixed; and so read the Chaldee and Vulgate.

And hast consumed us because of our iniquities "And hast delivered us up
into the hands of our iniquities" - For ותמוגנו vattemugenu, "hast
dissolved us," the Septuagint, Syriac, and Chaldee had in their copies
תמגננו temaggenenu, "hast delivered us up." Houbigant. Secker.

[Isaiah 64:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 64:8</span></span>

But, now, O Lord, thou art our Father "But thou, O Jehovah, thou art our
Father" - For ועתה veattah, and now, five MSS., one of them ancient, and
the two oldest editions, 1486 and 1488, have ואתה veattah, and thou, and
so the Chaldee seems to have read. The repetition has great force. The
other word may be well spared. "But now, O Lord, thou art our Father."
How very affectionate is the complaint in this and the following verses!
But how does the distress increase, when they recollect the desolations
of the temple, and ruin of public worship, [Isa
64:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#011.md) : "Our holy and beautiful house,
where our fathers praised thee, is burnt up with fire," etc.

We all are the work of thy hand - Three MSS. (two of them ancient) and
the Septuagint read מעשה maaseh, the work, without the conjunction ו vau
prefixed. And for ידך yadecha, thy hand, the Bodleian, and two others
MSS., the Septuagint, Syriac, and Vulgate read ידיך yadeycha, thy hands,
in the plural number. - L.

[Isaiah 64:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 64:9</span></span>

Neither remember iniquity - For לעד תזכר laad tizcor, one of my MSS. has
לעד תקצף laad tiktsoph, "be not angry," as in the preceding clause. This
has been partially obliterated, and תזכר tizcor, written in the margin
by a later hand: but this MS. abounds with words of this kind, all
altered by later hands.
