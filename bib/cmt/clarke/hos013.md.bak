### [Hosea Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#001.md)

[Hosea](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">hos 13:0</span></span>

Thus chapter begins with observing that the fear of God leads to
prosperity, but sin to ruin; a truth most visibly exemplified in the sin
and punishment of Ephraim, [Hos
13:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#001.md). As an aggravation of their
guilt, God reminds them of his former favors, [Hos
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#004.md), [Hos
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#005.md); which they had shamefully
abused, [Hos 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#006.md); and which now
expose them to dreadful punishments, [Hos
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#007.md), [Hos
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#008.md). He, however, tempers these awful
threatenings with gracious promises; and, on their repentance, engages
to save them, when no other could protect them, [Hos
13:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#009.md). But, alas! instead of
repenting, Ephraim is filling up the measure of his iniquity, [Hos
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#012.md), [Hos
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#013.md). Notwithstanding this, God
promises to put forth has almighty power in behalf of his people, and,
as it were, raise them from the dead, [Hos
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014.md); although, in the meantime, they
must be visited with great national calamities, compared first to the
noxious and parching east wind, [Hos
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#015.md), and described immediately after
in the plainest terms, [Hos 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#016.md).

[Hosea 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 13:1</span></span>

When Ephraim spake trembling - When he was meek and humble, of a broken
heart and contrite spirit.

He exalted himself in Israel - He became great in God's sight; he rose
in the Divine esteem in proportion as he sank in his own. But this did
not continue.

He offended in Baal - He became an idolater.

He died - The sentence of death from the Divine justice went out against
him.

This has been differently understood: "As soon as Ephraim spake (To your
tents, O Israel!) There was a trembling or commotion: then the kingdom
was exalted in Israel." Thus taken, it refers to the division of the ten
tribes from Rehoboam, son of Solomon, [Kg1
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#016.md), etc., and the establishment of
the kingdom of Israel under Jeroboam in opposition to that of Judah;
which breach was never healed.

[Hosea 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 13:2</span></span>

And now they sin more and more - They increase in every kind of vice,
having abandoned the great Inspirer of virtue.

Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves - This was the test. If there
be a Jew that pretends to sacrifice, and whose conversion is dubious,
let him come openly and kiss the calves. This will show what he is; no
real Jew will do this. If he be an idolater, he will not scruple. This
was the ancient method of adoration.

1\. They kissed the idol.

2\. When the statue was too high or too far off, they presented the
hand, in token of alliance.

3\. They brought that hand respectfully to their mouths, and kissed it.

This was the genuine act of adoration; from ad, to, and os, oris, the
mouth. So Pliny, Hist. Nat., lib. xxviii., c. 1. Adorando, dexteram ad
oscula referimus.

And Apuleius, Asin., lib. iv:

Admoventes oribus suis dexteram, ut ipsam prorsus deam religiosis
adorationibus venerabantur.

See Calmet, and see the note on [Job
31:17](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#017.md).

[Hosea 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 13:3</span></span>

Therefore they shall be as the morning Cloud - as the early Dew - as the
Chaff - as the Smoke - Four things, most easy to be driven about and
dissipated, are employed here to show how they should be scattered among
the nations, and dissipated by captivity.

[Hosea 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 13:4</span></span>

I am the Lord thy God - This was the first discovery I made of myself to
you, and the first commandment I gave; and I showed you that besides me
there was no Savior. There is a remarkable addition in the Septuagint
here: "But I am Jehovah thy God, who stretched out the heavens and
created the earth. And I showed them not to thee, that thou shouldest
walk after them. And I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt," etc.
This might have been once in the Hebrew text.

[Hosea 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 13:5</span></span>

I did know thee - I approved of thee; I loved thee; and by miraculously
providing for thee in that land of drought, I demonstrated my love.

[Hosea 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 13:6</span></span>

According to their pasture - They had a rich pasture, and were amply
supplied with every good. They became exalted in their heart, forgat
their God, and became a prey to their enemies. "He that exalteth himself
shall be abased."

[Hosea 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 13:7</span></span>

I will be unto them as a lion - שחל shachal is supposed to mean here the
black lion, frequent in Ethiopia.

As a leopard - נמר namar, so termed from its spotted skin, for to be
spotted is the signification of the root.

Will I observe them - The leopard, tiger, and panther will hide
themselves in thick bushwood, near where they expect any prey to pass;
and as soon as it comes near, spring suddenly upon it. To this is the
allusion in the text: "By the way will I observe them;" watch for them
as the leopard does. They shall be greatly harassed even on their way to
Assyria, when going into captivity.

[Hosea 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 13:8</span></span>

As a bear - bereaved - This is a figure to denote excessive ferocity.
See the note on [Sa2 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#008) (note.md),
where a remarkable instance is given.

And will rend the caul of their heart - Every savage beast goes first to
the seat of the blood when it has seized its prey; as in this fluid they
delight more than in the most delicate parts of the flesh.

There will I devour them like a lion - לביא labi, the old strong lion;
drinking the blood, tearing the flesh, and breaking the bones to extract
the marrow.

The wild beast shall tear them - Probably this refers to the chakal or
jackal, who frequently hunts down the prey, which the lion takes the
liberty to devour, while the jackal stands by, and afterwards picks the
bones. Hence he has been called the lion's Provider, and the lion's
waiting-man.

[Hosea 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 13:9</span></span>

O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself - These evils come not by my
immediate infliction; they are the consequences of thy own crimes. In
the above terrifying figures of the ferocious beasts, the prophet only
shows what they would meet with from the hand of the Assyrians in the
war, the famine, and the captivity; God being represented as doing what
he only permits to be done.

But in me is thine help - "Though thou hast destroyed thyself, yet in me
alone can thy help be found" - Newcome. And others read, And who will
help thee? reading מי mi, who, for בי bi, in me. Though this is
countenanced by the Syriac, yet there is no evidence of it in any of the
MSS. yet collated, nor do I think it to be the true reading.

[Hosea 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 13:10</span></span>

Give me a king and princes? - Referring to the time in which they cast
off the Divine theocracy and chose Saul in the place of Jehovah.

[Hosea 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 13:11</span></span>

I gave thee a king in mine anger - Such was Saul; for they highly
offended God when they clamoured to have a king like the heathen nations
that were around them.

Took him away in my wrath - Permitted him and the Israelites to fall
before the Philistines. Others think that Shalmaneser was the king thus
given, and Hoshea the king thus taken away.

[Hosea 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hos 13:12</span></span>

The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up - It is registered in my court of
justice; the death warrant is in store, and will be produced in due
time. Though there be not at present the judgment inflicted which such
glaring transgressions demand, yet it will surely come. Such crimes
cannot go unpunished.

[Hosea 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hos 13:13</span></span>

The sorrows of a travailing woman - These judgments shall come suddenly
and unavoidably.

The place of the breaking forth of children - As there is a critical
time in parturition in which the mother in hard labor may by skillful
assistants be eased of her burden, which, if neglected, may endanger the
life both of parent and child, so there was a time in which Ephraim
might have returned to God, but they would not; therefore they are now
in danger of being finally destroyed. And, speaking after the manner of
men, he must be deemed an unwise son, who if he had power and
consideration, would prolong his stay in the porch of life, where he
must necessarily be suffocated; so is Ephraim, who, though warned of his
danger, having yet power to escape, continued in his sin, and is now
come to destruction. I could illustrate the allusion in the text
farther, and show the accurate propriety of the original; but the
subject forbids it.

[Hosea 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hos 13:14</span></span>

I will ransom them from the power of the grave - In their captivity they
are represented as dead and buried, which is a similar view to that
taken of the Jews in the Babylonish captivity by Ezekiel in his vision
of the valley of dry bones. They are now lost as to the purpose for
which they were made, for which God had wrought so many miracles for
them and for their ancestors; but the gracious purpose of God shall not
be utterly defeated. He will bring them out of that grave, and ransom
them from that death; for as they have deserved that death and
disgraceful burial, they must be redeemed and ransomed from it, or still
lie under it. And who can do this but God himself? And he will do it. In
the prospect of this the prophet exclaims, in the person of the
universal Redeemer, "O death, I will be thy plagues;" I will bring into
thy reign the principle of its destruction. The Prince of life shall lie
for a time under thy power, that he may destroy that power.

O grave, I will be thy destruction - I will put an end to thy dreary
domination by rising from the dead, and bringing life and immortality to
life by my Gospel, and by finally raising from the death the whole human
race in the day of the general resurrection.

שאול sheol, which we translate grave, is the state of the dead. מות
maveth, which we translate death, is the principle of corruption that
renders the body unfit to be longer the tenement of the soul, and
finally decomposes it. Sheol shall be destroyed, for it must deliver up
all its dead. Maveth shall be annihilated, for the body shall be raised
incorruptible. See the use which the apostle makes of this passage, [Co1
15:54](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#054.md), [Co1
15:55](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#055.md); but he does not quote from the
Hebrew, nor from any of the ancient versions. He had to apply the
subject anew; and the Spirit, which had originally given the words,
chose to adapt them to the subject then in hand, which was the
resurrection of the dead in the last day. Instead of דבריך debareycha,
thy plagues, one of my oldest MSS., ninety-six of Kennicott's and
thirty-two of De Rossi's, have דברך debarcha, thy plague, that which
shall carry thee off, as the plague does them who are affected by it. To
carry off, carry away, is one of the regular meanings of the verb דבר
dabar.

Repentance shall be hid from mine eyes - On these points I will not
change my purpose; this is the signification of repentance when
attributed to God.

[Hosea 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">hos 13:15</span></span>

Though he be fruitful - יפריא yaphri; a paronomasia on the word אפרים
ephrayim, which comes from the same root פרה parah, to be fruitful, to
sprout, to bud.

An east wind shall come - As the east wind parches and blasts all
vegetation, so shall Shalmaneser blast and destroy the Israelitish
state.

[Hosea 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">hos 13:16</span></span>

Samaria shall become desolate - This was the capital of the Israelitish
kingdom. What follows is a simple prophetic declaration of the cruelties
which should be exercised upon this hapless people by the Assyrians in
the sackage of the city.
