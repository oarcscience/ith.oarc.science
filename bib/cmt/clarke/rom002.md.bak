### [Romans Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#001.md)

[Romans](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">rom 2:0</span></span>

The apostle shows that the Jew, who condemns the Gentiles, and considers
them utterly unworthy of the blessings of the Gospel, is inexcusable,
because he is guilty of the same crimes; and therefore shalt not escape
the righteous judgment of God, [Rom
2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#001.md). It is an awful thing to despise
the goodness and long-suffering of God, which lead to repentance, [Rom
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#004.md), [Rom
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#005.md). God, the impartial judge, will
render to every man according to his works, [Rom
2:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#006.md). The Jews and the Gentiles will
be judged according to their respective advantages and disadvantages,
[Rom 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#012.md), [Rom
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#013.md). In some cases, the Gentiles, who
had no law, have shown a better disposition than the Jews, [Rom
2:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#014.md). The Jews, by their
unfaithfulness, have been a stumbling-block to the Gentiles, [Rom
2:17-24](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#017.md). Jewish rites and ceremonies
of no advantage, unless productive of change of heart and conduct, [Rom
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#025.md). The Gentiles, who attend to the
small light which they have received from God, are in a better state
than the unfaithful Jews, with all their superior privileges, [Rom
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#026.md), [Rom
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#027.md). What constitutes a real Jew in
the sight of God, [Rom 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#028.md), [Rom
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029.md).

Dr. Taylor makes the following sensible observations at the commencement
of this chapter.

"The representation of the moral state of the heathen world, in the
foregoing chapter, is a demonstration of the necessity of the Gospel for
the reformation and salvation of man. And how rich is the favor
wherewith God has visited the world! To have destroyed a race of
apostate rebels, who had abused their understandings and every gift of a
bountiful Creator, would have been justice; to have spared them would
have been lenity and goodness; but to send his only begotten Son from
heaven to redeem us from all iniquity and ungodliness by his own blood;
to grant us a free pardon for all our sins; to put us in a state of
mercy and salvation; to take us into his kingdom and family; to give us
an inheritance among his saints; to bless us with immortality and all
spiritual blessings in heavenly places; - this is most wonderful and
exuberant favor. Rightly is the doctrine which teaches it called the
Gospel, or glad tidings. One would think it could not possibly have met
with opposition from any part of mankind. But the Jew opposed it! He
abhorred the Gentile, and contradicted the grace that honored and saved
him. The apostle pleads and defends our cause. His business is to
confound the Jew, and to prove that we have as good a right as he to all
the blessings of the Messiah's kingdom. And, by his description of the
vicious state of the Gentiles, in the former chapter, he has wisely made
his advantage of the prejudices of the Jew; for nothing could please him
more than the preceding discourse, in which the Gentiles are reduced to
so vile and abject a state. Thus the apostle gives him an opportunity to
condemn the Gentiles; but he does this that he may the more effectually
humble him in this chapter; in which he proves that the Jews, having in
an aggravated manner despised the goodness and broken the law of God,
were as obnoxious to his wrath as the Gentiles; and if so, how could
they, with any conscience or modesty, arrogate all the Divine mercy to
themselves, or pretend that others were unworthy of it, when they had
done as much or more to forfeit it! Must they not exclude themselves
from being the people of God under the Gospel, by the same reason that
they would have the Gentiles excluded! But this was an argument highly
ungrateful to the Jew; and it would be very difficult to fix any
conviction upon his mind. Therefore the apostle addresses him in a
covert way: - Thou art therefore inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art
that judgest; not giving out expressly that he meant the Jew, that the
Jew might more calmly attend to his reasoning, while he was not
apprehensive that he was the man. This point secured, the apostle, very
judiciously and with great force of reasoning, turns his thoughts from
his present superior advantages to the awful day of judgment, [Rom
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#005.md), [Rom
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#006.md), when God, in the most impartial
equity, will render to all mankind, without exception, according to
their works. Thus the apostle grounds his following argument, very
methodically and solidly, in God's equal regards to all men, in all
nations, who uprightly practice truth and godliness; and his
disapproving, and at last condemning, all men, in any nation, however
privileged, who live wickedly. This was a blow at the root, and
demolished, in the most effectual manner, the Jew's prejudices in favor
of his own nation, and the unkind thoughts he had entertained of the
Gentiles. For, if a Jew could be convinced that a sober, upright heathen
might be blessed with eternal salvation, he must be persuaded that it
was no absurd matter that believing Gentiles should now be pardoned, and
taken into the visible Church. Thus the apostle advances with great
skill, insinuating himself, by degrees, into the Jew's conscience. It is
reasoning is well adapted to encourage the Gentile, humbled by the
dismal representation in the preceding chapter; for he would here see
that he was not utterly abandoned of God, but might, upon good grounds,
hope for his mercy and kindness."

[Romans 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 2:1</span></span>

That judgest - Ὁ κρινων, the judger; thou assumest the character of a
judge, and in that character condemnest others who are less guilty than
thyself.

[Romans 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 2:2</span></span>

We are sure that the judgment of God, etc. - God is impartial, and will
punish sin wheresoever he finds it. Transgression in a Jew is not less
criminal than iniquity in a Gentile.

[Romans 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 2:4</span></span>

Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness - Wilt thou render of none
effect that marked benevolence of God towards thee which has given so
many superior advantages, and that forbearance which has tolerated thy
many miscarriages, and that long-suffering which, after repeated
provocations, still continues to bear with thee?

Not knowing - Αγνοων, not acknowledging that this goodness of God, which
has so long manifested itself in forbearance and long-suffering, leadeth
thee to repentance - was designed to accomplish this blessed end; which
thy want of consideration and acknowledgment has rendered, hitherto,
ineffectual. This was a maxim among the Jews themselves; for, in
Synopsis Sohar, it is said: - The holy blessed God delays his anger
against the wicked, to the end that they may repent and be converted.

[Romans 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 2:5</span></span>

But after thy hardness - Occasioned by thy long course of iniquity. And
impenitent heart-produced by thy hardness, through which thou art
callous to the calls and expostulations of conscience. Treasurest up -
continuest to increase thy debt to the Divine justice, which will
infallibly inflict wrath - punishment in the day of wrath - the judgment
day, in which he will render to every man according to his works. The
word treasure the Hebrew uses to express any kind of store or
collection: - Treasure or plenty of rain. [Deu
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#012.md) : The Lord shall open unto thee
his good Treasure, to give the Rain unto thy land. Treasure of
punishment. [Deu 32:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#034.md), [Deu
32:35](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#035.md) : Is not this sealed up among my
Treasures? To me belongeth Vengeance and Recompense. Treasures of mines,
i.e. abundance of minerals. [Deu 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#019.md)
: They shall suck of the Abundance of the seas, and of Treasures hid in
the sand. So treasures of gold, silver, corn, wine, oil, etc., mean
collections or an abundance of such things: the word is used by the
Greek writers precisely in the same sense. By wrath we are to understand
punishment, as in [Rom 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018.md); and it is
used so by the very best Greek writers. See Kypke.

The treasure of wrath, in this verse, is opposed to the riches of
goodness, in the preceding. As surely as thou despisest, or neglectest
to improve the Riches of God's Goodness, so surely thou shalt share in
the Treasures of his Wrath. The punishment shall be proportioned to the
mercy thou hast abused.

[Romans 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 2:6</span></span>

Who will render - Who, in the day of judgment, will reward and punish
every man according as his life and conversation have been.

[Romans 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 2:7</span></span>

To them, etc. - In this manner will God, in the great day, dispense
punishments and rewards:

1\. He will give eternal life to them who, in all the trials and
difficulties of the present state, have persevered in well doing -
seeking for and expecting glory, honor, and immortality.

[Romans 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rom 2:8</span></span>

But unto them, etc. -

2\. He will manifest his indignation, and inflict wrath - punishment, on
all who are contentious - who obstinately dispute against the truth, and
obey unrighteousness - who act under the influence of the principle of
sin, and not under the influence of the Spirit of God.

[Romans 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rom 2:9</span></span>

Tribulation and anguish - Misery of all descriptions, without the
possibility of escape, will this righteous Judge inflict upon every
impenitent sinner. The Jew first, as possessing greater privileges, and
having abused greater mercies; and also on the Gentile, who, though he
had not the same advantages, had what God saw was sufficient for his
state; and, having sinned against them, shall have punishment
proportioned to his demerit.

[Romans 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rom 2:10</span></span>

But glory, honor, and peace - While the finally impenitent Jew and
Gentile shall experience the fullest effects of the righteous
indignation of the supreme Judge, even man that worketh good - that
lives in a conscientious obedience to the known will of God, whether he
be Jew or Gentile, shall have glory, honor, and peace; i.e. eternal
blessedness.

[Romans 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rom 2:11</span></span>

For there is no respect of persons with God - The righteous Judge will
not act according to any principle of partiality; the character and
conduct, alone of the persons shall weigh with him. He will take no
wicked man to glory, let his nation or advantages be what they may; and
he will send no righteous man to perdition, though brought up in the
very bosom of Gentilism. And as he will judge in that day according to
character and conduct, so his judgment will proceed on the ground of the
graces, privileges, and blessings which they had received, improved or
abused. And as there is no respect of persons with God in judgment, so
there can be none in the previous administration of his saving
blessings. He that will be condemned for his unrighteousness, will be
condemned on the ground that he had sufficient grace afforded him for
the salvation of his soul; and his condemnation will rest on the simple
principle, that he abused the grace which was sufficient to save him, by
acting in opposition to its dictates and influence. No man, in that
great day, shall be brought to heaven through any partiality of the
Judge; and no man sent to hell because God did not afford him sufficient
grace, or because he had made a decree which rendered even his use of it
ineffectual to his salvation. In reference to the great design of God,
in the salvation of man, it shall be said, - in time, at the day of
judgment, and throughout eternity, - There Is No Respect of Persons with
God.

[Romans 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rom 2:12</span></span>

For as many as have sinned without law, etc. - They, viz. the Gentiles,
who shall be found to have transgressed against the mere light of
nature, or rather, that true light that lighteth every man that cometh
into the world, [Joh 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009.md), shall not
come under the same rule with those, the Jews, who have in addition to
this enjoyed an extraordinary revelation; but they shall be dealt with
according to the inferior dispensation, under which they lived: while
those, the Jews, who have sinned against the law - the positive Divine
revelation granted to them, shall be judged by that law, and punished
proportionably to the abuse of such an extraordinary advantage.

[Romans 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rom 2:13</span></span>

For not the hearers of the law, etc. - It does not follow, because one
people are favored with a Divine revelation, that therefore they shall
be saved; while the others who have not had that revelation, shall
finally perish: this is not God's procedure; where he has given a law -
a Divine revelation, he requires obedience to that law; and only those
who have been doers of that law - who have lived according to the light
and privileges granted in that revelation, shall be justified - shall be
finally acknowledged to be such as are fit for the kingdom of God.

[Romans 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rom 2:14</span></span>

For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, etc. - Nor does it follow
that the Gentiles who have not had a Divine revelation, shall either
perish, because they had it not; or their unrighteous conduct pass
unpunished, because not having this revelation might be considered as an
excuse for their sins.

Do by nature the things contained in the law - Do, without this Divine
revelation, through that light which God imparts to every man, the
things contained in the law - act according to justice, mercy,
temperance and truth, the practice of which the revealed law so
powerfully enjoins; these are a law unto themselves - they are not
accountable to any other law, and are not to be judged by any
dispensation different from that under which they live.

Rabbi Tanchum brings in the Supreme Being as saying: When I decreed any
thing against the Gentiles, to whom I have not given laws and statutes,
and they know what I have decreed; immediately they repent; but the
Israelites do not so. Tanchum, fol. 43. 2.

[Romans 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rom 2:15</span></span>

Which show the work of the law - In acting according to justice, mercy,
temperance, and truth, they show that the great object of the law, which
was to bring men from injustice, cruelty, intemperance, and falsity, is
accomplished so far in them: their conscience also bearing witness -
that faculty of the soul, where that Divine light dwells and works,
shows them that they are right; and thus they have a comfortable
testimony in their own souls of their own integrity: their thoughts, the
mean while, accusing, or else excusing one another; or rather, their
reasonings between one another accusing or answering for themselves. As
if the apostle had said: - And this point, that they have a law and act
according to it, is farther proved from their conduct in civil affairs;
and from that correct sense which they have of natural justice in their
debates, either in their courts of law, or in their treatises on
morality. All these are ample proofs that God has not left them without
light; and that, seeing they have such correct notions of right and
wrong, they are accountable to God for their conduct in reference to
these notions and principles. These seems to be the true meaning of this
difficult clause. See below.

[Romans 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 2:16</span></span>

In the day when God shall judge - And all this shall be farther
exemplified and proved in the day when God shall judge the secrets of
men by Jesus Christ; which judgment shall be according to my Gospel -
according to what I am now laying down before you, relative to the
impartiality of God, and his righteous procedure in judging men, not
according to their opinions or prejudices, not according to revelations
which they never possessed, but according to the various advantages or
disadvantages of their political, religious, or domestic situation in
life.

Much stress has been laid on the word, φυσει, by nature, in [Rom
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#014.md), as if the apostle designed to
intimate that nature, independently of the influence of Divine grace,
possessed such principles as were sufficient to guide a man to glory.
But certainly the term cannot be so understood here. I rather think that
the sense given to it in Suicer's Thesaurus, vol ii. col. 1475, reipsa,
revera, Certainly, Truly, is its sense here: for when the Gentiles,
which have not the law, φυσει ποιῃ, Truly, or in effect, Do the things
contained in the law, etc. This seems to be its sense in [Gal
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#008.md) : When ye knew not God, ye did
service to them which φυσει, Certainly are no gods; i.e. are false gods.
Suicer quotes Cyril of Alexandria, (sub Anathematismo iii. in Actis
Ephesinis, p. 212), speaking of the union of the two natures in Christ;
he calls this union φυσικην, natural; that is, says he, αληθη, true, or
real. He adds, that the word should be thus understood in [Eph
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#003.md) : We were by nature, φυσει,
children of wrath; and says, φυσει αντι του αληθως· φυσει is here used
for αληθως, Truly; We were Truly, Incontestably, the children of wrath,
even as others. That is, like the rest of mankind, we have all sinned
and come short of the glory of God, and, consequently are exposed to
punishment. Some think that this text refers to the natural corruption
of man; but, although it is true that man comes into the world corrupt,
and that all men, since the fall, are very far gone from original
righteousness, yet it is not clear that the text in [Eph
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#003.md), speaks of any other thing than
the effects of this degeneracy.

I prefer this sense, in the passage in question, to that which says the
light of nature, or natural instinct, is here meant; for I know of no
light in nature that is not kindled there by the grace of God. But I
have no objection to this sense: "When the Gentiles, which have not the
law, do, by the influence of God upon their hearts, the things contained
in the law, they are a law unto themselves; that light and influence
serving instead of a Divine revelation." That the Gentiles did really do
the things contained in the law, in reference to what is termed natural
justice, and made the wisest distinctions relative to the great
principles of the doctrine of civil Rights and Wrongs, every man
conversant with their writings will admit. And in reference to this the
word φυσει may be legitimately understood thus - they incontestably did
the things contained in the law, etc.

The passage in [Rom 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#015.md), Their
thoughts - accusing or excusing one another, certainly does not refer to
any expostulations or operations of conscience; for this is referred to
in the preceding clause. The words accusing, κατηγορουντων, and
excusing, απολογουμενων, answering or defending one another, μεταζυ
αλληλων, among themselves, are all forensic or law terms, and refer to
the mode of conducting suits of law in courts of justice, where one is
plaintiff, who produces his accusation; another is defendant, who rebuts
the charge and defends himself; and then the business is argued before
the judges. This process shows that they have a law of their own, and
that to this law it belongs to adjust differences - to right those who
have suffered wrong, and to punish the guilty.

As to the phrase written in their hearts, it is here opposed to the
Jewish laws, which were written on tables of stone. The Jews drew the
maxims by which their conduct was regulated from a Divine revelation:
the Gentiles theirs from what God, in the course of his providence and
gracious influence, had shown them to be right, useful, and necessary.
And with them this law was well known and affectionately regarded; for
this is one meaning of the phrase, written in the heart. It was from
this true light, enlightening the Gentiles, that they had so many wise
and wholesome laws; laws which had been among them from time immemorial,
and of which they did not know the origin. Thus Sophocles, in the noble
speech which he puts in the mouth of Antigone: -

Ου γαρ τι νυν γε κὐχθες, αλλ' αει ποτε

Ζη ταυτα, κοὑδεις οιδεν εξ ὁτου φανη

"Not now, nor yesterday, but evermore

These laws have lived: nor know we whence they came."

Antig. ver. 463-4.

These are the laws, νομινα, which the Spirit of God wrote originally on
their hearts; and which, in different forms, they had committed to
writing.

[Romans 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 2:17</span></span>

Behold, thou art called a Jew - What the apostle had said in the
preceding verses being sufficient to enforce conviction on the
conscience of the Jew, he now throws off the cover, and openly argues
with him in the most plain and nervous manner; asserting that his
superior knowledge, privileges, and profession, served only to aggravate
his condemnation. And that, in fact, he who, under all his greater
advantages, transgressed the law of God, stood condemned by the honest
Gentile, who, to the best of his knowledge obeyed it. Dr. Taylor.

And restest in the law - Thou trustest in it for thy endless salvation.
The word επαναπαυη, implies the strongest confidence of safety and
security. Thou reposest thy whole trust and confidence in this law.

And makest thy boast of God - That thou knowest his nature and
attributes, which are not known to the Gentiles. The word, καυχασαι,
implies the idea of exulting in any thing, as being a proper object of
hope and dependence: and, when referred to God, it points out that He is
the sure cause of hope, dependence, joy, and happiness; and that it is
the highest honor to be called to know his name, and be employed in his
service. As if the apostle had said: You rejoice in God as the object of
your hope and dependence; you praise and magnify him; you account it
your greatest honor that He is your God, and that you worship him.

[Romans 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rom 2:18</span></span>

Knowest his will - Hast been favored with a revelation of his own will,
immediately from himself.

The things that are more excellent - τα δισφεροντα, The things that
differ - that revelation which God has given of himself makes the nicest
distinctions between right and wrong; between vice and virtue; showing
how you should walk so as to please God, and, consequently, acquire the
most excellent portion that human spirits can have on this side heaven:
for all these blessings ye acknowledge to receive from your law, being
instructed, κατηχουμενος, being catechized, from your infancy, in the
knowledge of Divine things.

[Romans 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rom 2:19</span></span>

And art confident, etc. - In consequence of all these religious
advantages, ye believe that ye are able to teach others, and to be
guides and lights to the bewildered, darkened Gentiles, who may become
proselytes to your religion.

[Romans 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 2:20</span></span>

An instructer of the foolish, etc. - Ye believe the Gentiles to be babes
and fools when compared with yourselves; that ye alone possess the only
true knowledge; that ye are the only favourites of Heaven; and that all
nations must look up to you as possessing the only form of knowledge,
μορφωσιν της γνωσεως, the grand scheme and draught of all true science,
of every thing that is worthy to be learned: the system of eternal
truth, derived from the law. If, therefore, ye act not as becomes those
who have such eminent advantages, it must be to your endless disgrace
and infamy.

[Romans 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 2:21</span></span>

Thou therefore - Dr. Taylor has paraphrased this and the three following
verses thus: "What signify your pretensions to knowledge, and the office
of teaching others, if you have no regard to your own doctrine? What are
you the better for preaching against theft, if you are a thief yourself?
Or for declaring adultery unlawful, if you live in the practice of it?
Or for representing idolatry abominable, if you are guilty of sacrilege?
What honors or singular favors do you deserve, if, while you glory in
the law and your religious privileges, you dishonor God, and discredit
his religion, by transgressing his law, and living in open contradiction
to your profession? And this is more than supposition; notorious
instances might be produced of the forementioned crimes, whereby the
Jews of the present age have brought a reproach upon religion among the
Gentiles; as well as those Jews of former times, of whom the Prophet
Ezekiel speaks, [Eze 36:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#023.md) : And I
will sanctify my great name, which was Profaned among the Heathen, which
ye have Profaned in the midst of them."

That the Jewish priesthood was exceedingly corrupt in the time of the
apostle, and that they were so long before, is fully evident from the
sacred writings and from Josephus. The high-priesthood was a matter of
commerce, and was bought and sold like other commodities. Of this
Josephus gives many instances. The rapine of Eli's sons descended to
several generations. Dr. Whitby well observes that of all these things
mentioned by the apostle the Jewish doctors were notoriously guilty; and
of most of them they were accused by our Lord.

1\. They said and did not; and laid heavy burdens upon others, which
they would not touch with their own fingers, [Mat
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#003.md), [Mat
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#004.md).

2\. They made the house of God a den of thieves, [Mat
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#013.md); [Joh
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#016.md).

3\. They were guilty of adultery by unjust divorces, [Mat
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#009.md).

4\. Their polygamy was scandalous: even their rabbins, when they came to
any place, would exclaim, Who will be my wife for a day?

As to idolatry, they were perfectly saved from it ever since the
Babylonish captivity but to this succeeded sacrilege, as is most evident
in the profanation of the temple, by their commerce transacted even
within its courts; and their teaching the people that even their aged
parents might be left to starve, provided the children made a present to
the temple of that which should have gone for their support. According
to Josephus, Bell. Jud. l. vi. c. 26, They were guilty of theft,
treachery, adultery, sacrilege, rapine, and murder. And he adds, that
new ways of wickedness were invented by them; and that of all their
abominations the temple was the receptacle. In his Antiquities of the
Jews, lib. xx. c. 8, he says: The servants of the high priests took
away, by violence, the tithes of the priests, so that many of them
perished for want of food. Even their own writers acknowledge that there
were great irregularities and abominations among the rabbins.

So Bereshith rabba, sect. 55, fol. 54:

"Rabbi Abun proposed a parable concerning a master who taught his
disciples not to pervert justice, and yet did it himself; not to show
respect of persons, and yet did it himself; not to receive bribes, and
yet received them himself; not to take usury, and yet took it himself.
The disciple replied: - Rabbi, thou teachest me not to take usury, and
yet thou takest it thyself! Can that be lawful to thee which is
forbidden to me?"

[Romans 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">rom 2:24</span></span>

For the name of God is blasphemed, etc. - In Debarim rabba, sect. 2,
fol. 251, it is said: - "The rulers destroy the influence of their own
words among the people; and this is done when a rabbin, sitting and
teaching in the academy, says, Do not take usury, and himself takes it;
do not commit rapine, and himself commits it; do not steal, and himself
steals." That they were exceedingly lax in their morals, the following
fact proves: - "Rabbi Ilai said, If a man see that his evil propensities
are likely to prevail against him, let him go to some place where he is
not known, and let him put on black clothes, and cover his head with a
black veil; and then let him do whatsoever he pleases, lest the name of
God should be publicly profaned." Moed katon, fol. 17. 1. In Sohar
Levit. fol. 31, col. 122, it is said: - "On three accounts the Jews are
obliged to remain in captivity -

1\. Because they openly reproach the Shechinah -

2\. Because they profane themselves before the Shechinah -

3\. Because they turn away their faces from the Shechinah."

But it would be endless to collect from their history the proofs of the
charges brought here against them by the apostle. See Whitby,
Schoettgen, and others.

[Romans 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">rom 2:25</span></span>

For circumcision verily profiteth - It is a blessing to belong to the
Church of God and wear the sign of the covenant, provided the terms of
the covenant are complied with.

But if thou be a breaker of the law - If thou do not observe the
conditions of the covenant, the outward sign is both without meaning and
without effect. This was a maxim of the rabbins themselves; for they
allowed that an apostate or ungodly Israelite must go to hell,
notwithstanding his circumcision.

[Romans 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">rom 2:26</span></span>

Therefore if the uncircumcision, etc. - If the Gentile be found to act
according to the spirit and design of the law, his acting thus
uprightly, according to the light which God has afforded him, will be
reckoned to him as if he were circumcised and walked agreeably to the
law.

[Romans 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">rom 2:27</span></span>

And shall not uncircumcision, which is by nature - And shall not the
Gentile, who is εκ φυσεως, according to the custom of his country - who
is, by birth, not obliged to be circumcised.

If it fulfill the law - If such a person act according to the spirit and
design of the law; judge κρινει condemn thee, who, whilst thou dost
enjoy the letter, the written law, and bearest in thy body the proof of
the circumcision which it requires, dost transgress that law?

[Romans 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">rom 2:28</span></span>

For he is not a Jew - A genuine member of the Church of God, who has
only an outward profession.

Neither is that circumcision - Circumcision is a rite which represents a
spiritual thing, viz. the change and purification of the heart, as may
be seen, [Jer 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#004.md), [Jer
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#006.md), [Jer
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#010.md); [Jer
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#026.md); [Eze
44:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#007.md), [Eze
44:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#009.md).

[Romans 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">rom 2:29</span></span>

But he is a Jew - A true member of the Church of God.

Which is one inwardly - Who has his heart purified, according to what
God has uniformly prescribed by his prophets; see above: for
circumcision is of the heart, in the spirit, εν πνευματι by the Spirit
of God, who is the author of all spiritual affections and holy purposes:
or, every thing here is to be understood spiritually, and not literally;
for without holiness none can please God, and without holiness none can
see him.

Whose praise is not of men - It has, with great probability, been
conjectured that the apostle may here refer to the signification of the
name Jew, or Judah, יהודה Yehudah, Praise, from ידה Yadah, he Praised.
Such a one is a true Israelite, who walks in a conformity to the spirit
of his religion: his countrymen may praise him because he is a steady
professor of the Jewish faith; but God praises him, because he has
entered into the spirit and design of the covenant made with Abraham,
and has got the end of his faith, the salvation of his soul. Sentiments
like these, on the same subject, may be found in the ancient Jewish
writers. Rabbi Lipman gives the opinion of their most ancient and pure
writers in these words: - "A certain Christian mocked us, saying,
'Women, who cannot be circumcised, cannot be reckoned among Jews.' Such
persons are ignorant that faith does not consist in circumcision, but in
the heart. He who has not genuine faith is not a partaker of the Jewish
circumcision; but he who has genuine faith is a Jew, although not
circumcised." Nizzachon, Num. 21, p. 19. It is a curious maxim of the
Talmudists, That the Jews sit in the inmost recesses of the heart.
Nidda, fol. 20, 2. This is exactly the sentiment of St. Paul:
Circumcision is of the heart, in the spirit. In short, common sense, as
well as their law and their prophets, taught every considerate man among
them that God could be pleased with their rites and external
performances no farther than they led to holiness of heart and
righteousness of life.

1\. What the apostle says, in the preceding chapter, concerning the
Gentiles doing by nature the things contained in the law, if properly
considered, would lead certain persons from forming erroneous judgments
concerning the Divine dispensations. We are not to suppose that God is
not to be found where his written word does not appear; nor that the
salvation of the nations yet unblessed with the light of the Gospel is
impossible. God has never confined himself to any one particular way of
communicating his salvation, any more than he has confined his saving
grace to one people. His word is an indescribable blessing; but that
word becomes effectual to salvation when accompanied by the power of the
Holy Spirit. It was that Spirit which gave the word originally; and that
same Spirit can speak without this word. It is through his influence
alone that the Gentiles do the things contained in his own law; and it
is not to be wondered at that the work is the same, both in the law and
in the heart, when it has proceeded from the same Spirit.

2\. God therefore will judge all nations according to the use and abuse
they have made of this word, whether it was written in the heart, or
written on tables of stone.

3\. As he is no respecter of persons, all nations are equally dear to
him; and he has granted and will grant to them such discoveries of
himself as have been and will be sufficient for their salvation.

4\. His Word is an infinite blessing; and he has given it to one people
that they may be the means of conveying it to another. Europe, and
especially Christian Europe, has got the Bible; and God requires Europe
to send the Bible throughout the earth. If this be not done, through
their neglect, the Gentile nations will not be destroyed by a merciful
God; yet the Europeans will have a most solemn and awful account to
render to their Judge, that they have hidden the heavenly light under
their own bushel. Britain is shaking herself from the dust, and, by
means of the British and Foreign Bible Society, is sending the holy
Scriptures to every kingdom, and nation, and people, and tongue. The
Gentiles are now learning from the written law more fully and savingly
what the Spirit of God had before written on their hearts; and it seems
as if the kingdom of God were now about to come with all-conquering
power.
