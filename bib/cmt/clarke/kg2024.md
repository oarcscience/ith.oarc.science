### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001)

[4 Kings (2 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg2 24:0</span></span>

Nebuchadnezzar brings Jehoiakim under subjection; who, after three
years, rebels, [Kg2 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001). Bands of
Chaldeans, Syrians, Moabites, and Ammonites, invade the land, [Kg2
24:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#002). Jehoiakim dies, and Jehoiachin
his son reigns in his stead, [Kg2
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#005), [Kg2
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#006). The Babylonians overcome the
Egyptians, [Kg2 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#007). Nebuchadnezzar
takes Jehoiachin and his family, and all his treasures, and those of the
temple, and all the chief people and artificers, and carries them to
Babylon, [Kg2 24:8-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#008); and makes
Mattaniah, brother of Jehoiakim, king, who reigns wickedly, and rebels
against the king of Babylon, [Kg2
24:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#017).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 24:1</span></span>

Nebuchadnezzar - This man, so famous in the writings of the prophets,
was son of Nabopolassar. He was sent by his father against the rulers of
several provinces that had revolted; and he took Carchemish, and all
that belonged to the Egyptians, from the Euphrates to the Nile.
Jehoiakim, who was tributary to Nechoh king of Egypt, he attacked and
reduced; and obliged to become tributary to Babylon. At the end of three
years he revolted; and then a mixed army, of Chaldeans, Syrians,
Moabites, and Ammonites, was sent against him, who ravaged the country,
and took three thousand and twenty-three prisoners, whom they brought to
Babylon, [Jer 52:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#028).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 24:2</span></span>

According to the word of the Lord - See what Huldah predicted, [Kg2
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#016), and see chap. 14, 15, and 16 of
Jeremiah.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 24:6</span></span>

Jehoiachin his son - As this man reigned only three months and was a
mere vassal to the Babylonians, his reign is scarcely to be reckoned;
and therefore Jeremiah says of Jehoiakim, He shall have none to sit upon
the throne of David, [Jer 36:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#030), for
at that time it belonged to the king of Babylon, and Jehoiachin was a
mere viceroy or governor. Jehoiachin is called Jechonias in [Mat
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#011).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 24:7</span></span>

The king of Egypt came not again - He was so crushed by the Babylonians
that he was obliged to confine himself within the limits of his own
states, and could no more attempt any conquests. The text tells us how
much he had lost by the Babylonians. See on [Kg2
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001) (note).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 24:8</span></span>

Jehoiachin was eighteen years old - He is called Jeconiah, [Ch1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#016), and Coniah, [Jer
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#024). In [Ch2
36:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#009), be is said to be only eight
years of age, but this must be a mistake; for we find that, having
reigned only three months, he was carried captive to Babylon, and there
he had wives; and it is very improbable that a child between eight and
nine years of age could have wives; and of such a tender age, it can
scarcely be said that, as a king, he did that which was evil in the
sight of the Lord. The place in Chronicles must be corrupted.

That he was a grievous offender against God, we learn from [Jer
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#024), which the reader may consult;
and in the man's punishment, see his crimes.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 24:12</span></span>

Jehoiachin - went out - He saw that it was useless to attempt to defend
himself any longer; and he therefore surrendered himself, hoping to
obtain better terms.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 24:13</span></span>

He carried out thence all the treasures - It has been remarked that
Nebuchadnezzar spoiled the temple three times. -

1\. He took away the greater part of those treasures when he took
Jerusalem under Jehoiakim: and the vessels that he took then he placed
in the temple of his god, [Dan 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#002).
And these were the vessels which Belshazzar profaned, [Dan
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#002); and which Cyrus restored to Ezra,
when he went up to Jerusalem, [Ezr
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#002). It was at this time that he took
Daniel and his companions.

2\. He took the remaining part of those vessels, and broke them or cut
them in pieces, when he came the second tine against Jerusalem under
Jeconiah; as is mentioned here, [Kg2
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#013).

3\. He pillaged the temple, took away all the brass, the brazen pillars,
brazen vessels, and vessels of gold and silver, which he found there
when he besieged Jerusalem under Zedekiah, [Kg2
25:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#013).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 24:14</span></span>

He carried away all Jerusalem - That is, all the chief men, the nobles,
and artificers. Among these there were of mighty men seven thousand; of
craftsmen and smiths, one thousand.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 24:17</span></span>

Made Mattaniah his father's brother king in his stead - He was the son
of Josiah, and brother to Jehoiakim.

Changed his name to Zedekiah - See the note on [Kg2
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#034).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 24:19</span></span>

He did - evil - How astonishing is this! not one of them takes warning
by the judgments of God, which fell on their sinful predecessors.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 24:20</span></span>

Zedekiah rebelled - This was in the eighth year of his reign: and he is
strongly reproved for having violated the oath he took to the king of
Babylon: see [Ch2 36:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#013). This was the
filling up of the measure of iniquity; and now the wrath of God descends
upon this devoted king, city, and people, to the uttermost. See the
catastrophe in the next chapter.
