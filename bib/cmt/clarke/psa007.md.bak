### [Psalms Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 7:0</span></span>

The psalmist prays against the malice of his enemies, [Psa
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#001.md), [Psa
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#002.md); protests his own innocence, [Psa
7:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#003.md); prays to God that he would
vindicate him, for the edification of his people, [Psa
7:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#006.md); prays against the wickedness of
his enemies, [Psa 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#009.md); expresses
strong confidence in God, [Psa 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#010.md);
threatens transgressors with God's judgments, [Psa
7:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#011.md); shows the conduct and end of
the ungodly, [Psa 7:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#014.md); and exults
in the mercy and lovingkindness of his Maker, [Psa
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#017.md).

This Psalm is entitled, Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the Lord,
concerning the words of Cush the Benjamite. The word שגיון shiggayon
comes from שגה shagah, to wander, a wandering song; i.e., a Psalm
composed by David in his wanderings, when he was obliged to hide himself
from the fury of Saul.

Bishop Horsley thinks it may have its name, a wandering ode, from its
being in different parts, taking up different subjects, in different
styles of composition. But he has sometimes thought that shiggaion might
be an unpremeditated song; an improviso.

As to Cush the Benjamite, he is a person unknown in the Jewish history;
the name is probably a name of disguise; and by it he may covertly mean
Saul himself, the son of Kish, who was of the tribe of Benjamin. The
subject of the Psalm will better answer to Saul's unjust persecution and
David's innocence, than to any other subject in the history of David.

[Psalms 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 7:1</span></span>

O Lord my God - יהוה אלהי Yehovah Elohai, words expressive of the
strongest confidence the soul can have in the Supreme Being. Thou
self-existent, incomprehensible, almighty, and eternal Being, who
neither needest nor hatest any thing that thou hast made; thou art my
God: God in covenant with thy creature man; and my God and portion
particularly. Therefore, in thee do I put thy trust - I repose all my
confidence in thee, and expect all my good from thee.

Save me - Shield me from my persecutors; abate their pride, assuage
their malice, and confound their devices!

Deliver me - From the counsels which they have devised, and from the
snares and gins they have laid in my path.

[Psalms 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 7:2</span></span>

Lest he tear my soul like a lion - These words seem to answer well to
Saul. As the lion is king in the forest; so was Saul king over the land.
As the lion, in his fierceness, seizes at once, and tears his prey in
pieces; so David expected to be seized and suddenly destroyed by Saul.
He had already, in his rage, thrown his javelin at him, intending to
have pierced him to the wall with it. As from the power of the lion no
beast in the forest could deliver any thing; so David knew that Saul's
power was irresistible, and that none of his friends or well-wishers
could save or deliver him out of such hands. "Lest he tear my soul (my
life) like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to
deliver." All this answers to Saul, and to none else.

[Psalms 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 7:3</span></span>

If I have done this - David was accused by Saul of affecting the
kingdom; and of waiting for an opportunity to take away the life of his
king, his patron, and his friend. In his application to God he refers to
these charges; meets them with indignation; and clears himself of them
by a strong appeal to his Judge; and an imprecation that, if he had
meditated or designed any such thing, he might meet with nothing but
curse and calamity either from God or man.

[Psalms 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 7:4</span></span>

Yea, I have delivered him - When, in the course of thy providence, thou
didst put his life in my hand in the cave, I contented myself with
cutting off his skirt, merely to show him the danger he had been in, and
the spirit of the man whom he accused of designs against his life; and
yet even for this my heart smote me, because it appeared to be an
indignity offered to him who was the Lord 's anointed. This fact, and my
venturing my life frequently for his good and the safety of the state,
sufficiently show the falsity of such accusations, and the innocence of
my life.

[Psalms 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 7:5</span></span>

Let the enemy persecute my soul - If I have been guilty of the things
laid to my charge, let the worst evils fall upon me.

[Psalms 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 7:6</span></span>

Arise, O Lord, in thine anger - To thee I commit my cause; arise, and
sit on the throne of thy judgment in my behalf.

[Psalms 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 7:7</span></span>

For their sakes therefore return thou on high - Thy own people who
compass thy altar, the faithful of the land, are full of gloomy
apprehensions. They hear the charges against me; and see how I am
persecuted. Their minds are divided; they know not what to think. For
their sakes, return thou on high - ascend the judgment-seat; and let
them see, by the dispensations of thy providence, who is innocent and
who is guilty. David feared not to make this appeal to God; for the
consciousness of his innocence showed him at once how the discrimination
would be made.

[Psalms 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 7:8</span></span>

The Lord shall judge the people - He will execute justice and maintain
truth among them. They shall not be as sheep without a shepherd.

Judge me, O Lord - Let my innocence be brought to the light, and my just
dealing made clear as the noonday.

[Psalms 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 7:9</span></span>

The wickedness of the wicked - The iniquity of Saul's conduct.

But establish the just - Show the people my uprightness.

[Psalms 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 7:10</span></span>

My defense is of God - I now leave my cause in the hands of my Judge. I
have no uneasy or fearful apprehensions, because I know God will save
the upright in heart.

[Psalms 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 7:11</span></span>

God is angry with the wicked every day - The Hebrew for this sentence is
the following: ועל זעם בכל יום veel zoem becol yom; which, according to
the points, is, And God is angry every day. Our translation seems to
have been borrowed from the Chaldee, where the whole verse is as
follows: אלהא דינא זכאה ובתקוף רגיז אל רשיעי כל יומא elaha daiyana
zaccaah ubithkoph rageiz al reshiey col yoma: "God is a righteous Judge;
and in strength he is angry against the wicked every day."

The Vulgate: Deus Judex justus, fortis, et patiens; numquid irascitur
per sinpulos dies? "God is a Judge righteous, strong, and patient; will
he be angry every day?"

The Septuagint: Ὁ Θεος Κριτης δικαιος, και ισχυρος, και μακροθυμος, μη
οργην επαγων καθ' ἑκαστην ἡμεραν; "God is a righteous Judge, strong and
longsuffering; not bringing forth his anger every day."

Syriac: "God is the Judge of righteousness; he is not angry every day."

The Arabic is the same as the Septuagint.

The Aethiopic: "God is a just Judge, and strong and longsuffering; he
will not bring forth tribulation daily."

Coverdale: God is a righteous judge, and Gob is ever threateninge.

King Edward's Bible by Becke 1549, follows this reading.

Cardmarden: God is a righteous judge, \[strong and patient\] and God is
provoked every day. Cardmarden has borrowed strong and patient from the
Vulgate or Septuagint, but as he found nothing in the Hebrew to express
them, he put the words in a smaller letter, and included them in
brackets. This is followed by the prose version in our Prayer Book.

The Genevan version, printed by Barker, the king's printer, 1615,
translates thus: "God judgeth the righteous, and him that contemneth God
every day." On which there is this marginal note: "He doth continually
call the wicked to repentance, by some signs of his judgments." My
ancient Scotico - English MS. Psalter only begins with the conclusion of
this Psalm.

I have judged it of consequence to trace this verse through all the
ancient versions in order to be able to ascertain what is the true
reading, where the evidence on one side amounts to a positive
affirmation, "God is angry every day;" and, on the other side, to as
positive a negation, "He is Not angry every day." The mass of evidence
supports the latter reading. The Chaldee first corrupted the text by
making the addition, with the wicked, which our translators have
followed, though they have put the words into italics, as not being in
the Hebrew text. In the MSS. collated by Kennicott and De Rossi there is
no various reading on this text.

The true sense may be restored thus: -

אל el, with the vowel point tsere, signifies God: אל al, the same
letters, with the point pathach, signifies not. Several of the versions
have read it in this way: "God judgeth the righteous, and is Not angry
every day." He is not always chiding, nor is he daily punishing,
notwithstanding the continual wickedness of men: hence, the ideas of
patience and longsufferiny which several of the versions introduce. Were
I to take any of the translations in preference to the above, I should
feel most inclined to adopt that of Coverdale.

[Psalms 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 7:12</span></span>

If he turn not - This clause the Syriac adds to the preceding verse.
Most of the versions read, "If ye return not." Some contend, and not
without a great show of probability, that the two verses should be read
in connection, thus: "God is a just Judge; a God who is provoked every
day. If (the sinner) turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his
bow, and made it ready." This, no doubt, gives the sense of both.

[Psalms 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 7:13</span></span>

He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death - This appears to
be all a prophecy of the tragical death of Saul. He was wounded by the
arrows of the Philistines; and his own keen sword, on which he fell,
terminated his woful days!

[Psalms 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 7:14</span></span>

He travaileth with iniquity - All these terms show the pitch of envy,
wrath, and malevolence, to which Saul had carried his opposition against
David. He conceived mischief; he travailed with iniquity; he brought
forth falsehood - all his expectations were blasted.

[Psalms 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 7:15</span></span>

He made a pit - He determined the destruction of David. He laid his
plans with much artifice; he executed them with zeal and diligence; and
when he had, as he supposed, the grave of David digged, he fell into it
himself! The metaphor is taken from pits dug in the earth, and slightly
covered over with reeds &c. so as not to be discerned from the solid
ground; but the animal steps on them, the surface breaks, and he falls
into the pit and is taken. "All the world agrees to acknowledge the
equity of that sentence, which inflicts upon the guilty the punishment
intended by them for the innocent." - Horne.

[Psalms 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 7:16</span></span>

Shall come down upon his own pate - Upon his scalp, קדקד kodkod, the top
of the head. It may refer to knocking the criminal on the head, in order
to deprive him of life. Had scalping been known in those days, I should
have thought the reference might be to that barbarous custom.

[Psalms 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 7:17</span></span>

I will praise the Lord according to his righteousness - I shall
celebrate both his justice and his mercy. I will sing praise to the name
of the Lord Most High. The name of God is often put for his perfections.
So here, שם יהוה עלין shem Yehovah Elyon; "The perfections of Jehovah,
who is above all." My old Scotico - English MS., mentioned at the
conclusion of the introduction, begins at this verse, where are the
following words by way of paraphrase: Sang falles til ioy; and he that
synges well that name, his ioy es mare than i kan tell. Those who are
happy may sing; and he who can duly celebrate the name of God, who knows
it to be a strong tower into which he can run and find safety, has
inexpressible happiness. That is the sense of the above.
