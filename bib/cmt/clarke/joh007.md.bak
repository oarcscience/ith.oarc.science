### [John Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#001.md)

[John](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">joh 7:0</span></span>

Jesus continues in Galilee, [Joh 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#001.md).
He is desired to go to the feast of tabernacles, [Joh
7:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#002.md). His answer, [Joh
7:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#006.md). He goes up, and the Jews seek
him at the feast, [Joh 7:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#010.md). He
teaches in the temple, [Joh 7:14-24](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#014.md).
The Jews are confounded by his preaching, [Joh
7:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#025.md). He continues to teach; they
wish to slay him, [Joh 7:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#028.md). Many
of the people believe on him, [Joh
7:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#031.md). The Pharisees murmur, and our
Lord reasons with them, [Joh 7:32-36](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#032.md).
His preaching on the last day of the feast, [Joh
7:37-39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037.md). The people are greatly
divided in their opinions concerning him, [Joh
7:40-44](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#040.md). The officers, who were sent
by the Pharisees to take him, return, and because they did not bring
him, their employers are offended, [Joh
7:45-49](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#045.md). Nicodemus reasons with them,
[Joh 7:50-53](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#050.md).

[John 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 7:1</span></span>

After these things - St. John passes from the preceding discourse of our
Lord, which he delivered a little before the passover, [Joh
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#004.md), to the Feast of Tabernacles,
which happened six months after, and thus omits many things mentioned by
the other evangelists, which our blessed Lord said and did during that
time. He had already gone over Galilee four or five times; and he
continued there, because he found that the hatred of the Jews was such
that they would kill him if they could meet with him in Judea; and his
time to suffer was not yet come.

For he would not walk in Jewry - Instead of this, some MSS., versions,
and fathers read, ουγαρ ειχεν εξουσιαν, he had not authority, or liberty
to walk, etc. That is, he was no longer tolerated, and could not preach
publicly in Judea, but at the risk of his life. He found greater scope
for the exercise of his important ministry in Galilee than in Judea, as
the chief priests, etc., were continually plotting his death.

[John 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 7:2</span></span>

Feast of tabernacles - This feast was celebrated on the fifteenth day of
the month Tisri, answering to the last half of our September, and the
first half of October. This month was the seventh of the ecclesiastical,
and first of the civil, year. The feast took its name from the tents
which were erected about the temple, in public places, in courts, and on
the flat roofs of their houses, and in gardens; in which the Jews dwelt
for eight days, in commemoration of the forty years during which their
fathers dwelt in the wilderness. It was one of the three solemn annual
feasts in which all the males were obliged, by the law, to appear at
Jerusalem.

This feast was celebrated in the following manner. All the people cut
down branches of palm trees, willows, and myrtles, (and tied them
together with gold and silver cords, or with ribbons), which they
carried with them all day, took them into their synagogues, and kept
them by them while at prayers. On the other days of the feast they
carried them with them into the temple and walked round the altar with
them in their hands, singing, Hosanna! i.e. Save, we beseech thee! - the
trumpets sounding on all sides. To this feast St. John seems to refer,
[Rev 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009.md), [Rev
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#010.md), where he represents the saints
standing before the throne, with palm branches in their hands, singing,
Salvation to God, etc. On the seventh day of the feast, they went seven
times round the altar, and this was called Hosanna rabba, the great
Hosanna. See the notes on [Mat 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#009.md).
But the ceremony at which the Jews testified most joy was that of
pouring out the water, which was done on the eighth day of the feast. A
priest drew some water out of the pool Siloam, in a golden vessel, and
brought it into the temple; and at the time of the morning sacrifice,
while the members of the sacrifice were on the altar, he went up and
poured this water mingled with wine upon it, the people all the while
singing, with transports of joy, [Isa
12:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#001.md), especially [Isa
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#006.md) : With joy shall ye draw water
out of the wells of salvation. To this part of the ceremony, our Lord
appears to allude in [Joh 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037.md), of
this chapter.

During this feast many sacrifices were offered. On the first day,
besides the ordinary sacrifices, they offered, as a burnt-offering,
thirteen calves, two rams, and fourteen lambs with the offerings of
flour and the libations of wine that were to accompany them. They
offered also a goat for a sin-offering. On all the succeeding days they
offered the same sacrifices, only abating one of the calves each day, so
that when the seventh day came, they had but seven calves to offer. On
the eighth day, which was kept with greater solemnity than the rest,
they offered but one calf, one ram, and seven lambs, for a
burnt-offering, and one goat for a sin-offering, with the usual
offerings and libations. On this day, they also offered in the temple
the first fruits of their latter crops, or of those things which come
latest to maturity. During the feast, the 113th, 114th, 115th, 116th,
117th, 118th, and 119th Psalms were sung. Leo of Modena says that,
though Moses appointed but eight days, yet custom and the devotion of
the people have added a ninth to it, which is called the joy of the law,
because that on it they complete the reading of the Pentateuch. See
Calmet's Com. and Dict., and father Lamy. For the law relative to this
institution, see [Lev 23:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#039.md), [Lev
23:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#040) (note.md), etc., and the notes
there; and [Num 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#016.md), etc.

[John 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 7:3</span></span>

His brethren - said - It is generally supposed that these were the
children of the sisters of his mother Mary; but some of the ancients
have stated that Joseph had several children by a former wife. See the
account of the evangelist prefixed to this Gospel. No solid proof can be
alleged against this; nor can we pretend to say that these were not the
children of Joseph and Mary. Our blessed Lord, it is true, was her first
born, while she was yet a virgin; but no man can prove that he was her
last. It is an article of faith, in the Popish Church, to believe in the
perpetual virginity of Mary; and in this respect, without any reason,
several Protestants seem to be Papists. However this may be, it is
certain that the Hebrews gave the name of brethren to all the relatives
of a particular family. See [Gen
31:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#032.md), [Gen
31:46](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#046.md).

That thy disciples also may see - That is, the disciples which he had
made two years and six months before, at the Passover: [Joh
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#023.md).

[John 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 7:4</span></span>

No man that doeth any thing in secret, etc. - They took it for granted
that Christ was influenced by the same spirit which themselves felt; and
that therefore he should use every opportunity of exhibiting himself to
the public, that he might get into repute; and they hoped that a part of
his honor would be reflected back upon themselves, as being his near
relations. They seem to have said: "It is too little to employ thyself
in working miracles in Galilee, in the country, and in small villages,
among an ignorant and credulous people, from whom thou canst not get
much credit: go to Jerusalem, the capital, and among the learned
doctors, in the presence of the whole nation assembled at this feast,
work thy miracles, and get thyself a name."

[John 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 7:5</span></span>

Neither did his brethren believe in him - They did not receive him as
the promised Messiah; but, having seen so many of his miracles, they
could not but consider him as an eminent prophet. They supposed that, if
he were the Messiah, he would wish to manifest himself as such to the
world; and, because he did not do so, they did not believe that he was
the salvation of Israel.

[John 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 7:6</span></span>

My time is not yet come - It is probable our Lord meant no more than
this, that he had some business to transact before he could go to
Jerusalem; but his brethren, having nothing to hinder them might set off
immediately. Others think he speaks of his passion: My time of suffering
is not yet come: as ye are still in friendship with the world, ye need
not be under any apprehension of danger: ye may go when ye please. The
first sense I think is the best.

[John 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 7:7</span></span>

The world cannot hate you - The Jews will not persecute you, because ye
are in their sentiments and interests. Ye also expect a worldly Messiah.

But me it hateth - Because I condemn its injustice, its pride, its
ambition, and its maxims, by my life and doctrine. It is very likely
that the term world means here the Jewish people only: this is an
acceptation in which ὑ κοσμος frequently occurs in this Gospel. See on
John 17 (note).

[John 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 7:8</span></span>

I go not up yet unto this feast - Porphyry accuses our blessed Lord of
falsehood, because he said here, I will not go to this feast, and yet
afterwards he went; and some interpreters have made more ado than was
necessary, in order to reconcile this seeming contradiction. To me the
whole seems very simple and plain. Our Lord did not say, I will not go
to this feast; but merely, I go not yet, ουπω, or am not going, i.e. at
present; because, as he said [Joh 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#006.md),
and repeats here, his time was not yet come - he had other business to
transact before he could go. And it is very likely that his business
detained him in Galilee till the feast was half over: for we do not find
him at Jerusalem till the middle of the feast, [Joh
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#014.md), i.e. till the feast had been
begun four days. He might also be unwilling to go at that time, there
being such a great concourse of people on the road to Jerusalem, and his
enemies might say that he had availed himself of this time and multitude
in order to excite sedition.

[John 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 7:10</span></span>

But when his brethren were gone up - Having despatched his business, and
the concourse of people being now past, he went up also.

[John 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 7:11</span></span>

Then the Jews sought him - By Jews here are to be understood the
scribes, Pharisees, and rulers of the people, and not the inhabitants of
the province of Judea. It appears, from the following verses, that many
of the people were prejudiced in his favor, but they dared not to own it
publicly for fear of the Jews, i.e. for fear of the rulers of the
people.

[John 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 7:12</span></span>

Some said, He is a good man - The multitude were divided in their
opinions concerning him: those who knew him best said, He is a good man.
Those who spoke according to the character given him by the priests,
etc., said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people. Those who spoke evil of
him spoke out, because they had the rulers on their side; but those who
spoke good of him were obliged to do it in private, because they feared
these rulers. Calumny and slander are among the privileged orders; they
stalk abroad with their thousand brazen mouths, and blast the reputation
of the followers of God. Benevolence and candor are only on sufferance;
and a whisper in secret is the most they are permitted to give in behalf
of Christ and his followers, whose laws and maxims condemn a vicious
world, and goad it to revenge.

[John 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 7:14</span></span>

The midst of the feast - Though the canons required him to be there on
the first day, for the performance of a great variety of rites, yet, as
these were in general the invention of their doctors, he might think it
very proper neither to attend nor perform them.

[John 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 7:15</span></span>

How knoweth this man letters, having never learned? - The Jewish
learning consisted in the knowledge of their own scriptures, and the
traditions of their elders. In this learning our blessed Lord excelled.
No person ever spoke with more grace and dignity, or knew better how to
make a more proper use, or a happier application, of Jewish allegories
and parables; because none ever penetrated the sense of the Scriptures
as he did; none ever cited them more successfully, or ever showed their
accomplishment in so complete and satisfactory a manner. As these
branches of learning were taught at the Jewish schools, and our Lord had
never attended there, they were astonished to find him excelling in that
sort of learning, of which they themselves professed to be the sole
teachers.

[John 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 7:16</span></span>

My doctrine is not mine - Our blessed Lord, in the character of Messiah,
might as well say, My doctrine is not mine, as an ambassador might say,
I speak not my own words, but his who sent me: and he speaks these words
to draw the attention of the Jews from the teaching of man to the
teaching of God; and to show them that he was the promised Messiah, the
very person on whom, according to the prophet, ([Isa
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002).md), the Spirit of Jehovah - the
Spirit of wisdom, counsel, understanding, might, and knowledge, should
rest.

[John 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 7:17</span></span>

If any man wilt do his will, etc. - I will give you a sure rule by which
ye may judge of my doctrine: If you really wish to do the will of God,
begin the practice of it; and take my doctrine, and apply it to all that
you know God requires of man; and if you find one of my precepts
contrary to the nature, perfections, and glory of God, or to the present
or eternal welfare of men, then ye shall be at liberty to assert that my
doctrine is human and erroneous, and God has not sent me. But if, on the
contrary, ye find that the sum and substance of my preaching is, That
men shall love God with all their heart, soul, mind, and strength, and
their neighbor as themselves; and that this doctrine must bring glory to
God in the highest, while it produces peace and good will among men;
then acknowledge that God has visited you, and receive me as the Messiah
promised to your fathers.

[John 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 7:18</span></span>

He that speaketh of himself, etc. - I will give you another rule,
whereby you shall know whether I am from God or not: If I speak so as to
procure my own glory, to gratify vanity, or to secure and promote my
secular interests, then reject me as a deceiver and as a false prophet.
But if I act only to promote the glory of God, to induce all men to love
and obey him; if I propose nothing but what leads to the perfection of
his law, and the accomplishment of its ordinances, you cannot help
acknowledging me at least for a true prophet; and, if you add to this
the proofs which I have given of my mission and power, you must
acknowledge me as the mighty power of God, and the promised Messiah.

And no unrighteousness is in him - Or, there is no falsehood in him: so
the word αδικια should be translated here; and it is frequently used by
the Septuagint for שקר sheker, a lie, falsehood, etc. See in [Psa
52:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#003.md); [Psa
119:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#029.md), [Psa
119:69](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#069.md), [Psa
119:104](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#104.md), [Psa
119:163](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#163.md); [Psa
144:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#008.md). This is its meaning in [Rom
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#008.md); where αδικια, falsehood, is put
in opposition to αληθεια, truth.

[John 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 7:19</span></span>

Did not Moses give you the law, etc. - The scribes and Pharisees
announced our Lord to the multitude as a deceiver; and they grounded
their calumny on this, that he was not an exact observer of the law, for
he had healed a man on the Sabbath day, [Joh
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#009.md), [Joh
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#010.md); and consequently must be a false
prophet. Now they insinuated, that the interests of religion required
him to be put to death:

1\. As a violator of the law; and,

2\. as a false prophet and deceiver of the people.

To destroy this evil reasoning, our Lord speaks in this wise: If I
deserve death for curing a man on the Sabbath, and desiring him to carry
home his bed, which you consider a violation of the law, you are more
culpable than I am, for you circumcise a child on the Sabbath, which
requires much more bustle, and is of so much less use than what I have
done to the infirm man. But, if you think you do not violate the law by
circumcising a child on the Sabbath, how can you condemn me for having
cured one of yourselves, who has been afflicted thirty and eight years?
If you consider my conduct with the same eye with which you view your
own, far from finding any thing criminal in it, you will see much reason
to give glory to God. Why, therefore, go ye about to kill me, as a
transgressor of the law, when not one of yourselves keeps it?

[John 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 7:20</span></span>

Thou hast a devil - The crowd, who made this answer, were not in the
secret of the chief priests. They could not suppose that any person
desired to put him to death for healing a diseased man; and therefore,
in their brutish manner, they say, Thou hast a demon - thou art beside
thyself, and slanderest the people, for none of them desires to put thee
to death. The Codex Cyprius (K), four others, and the margin of the
later Syriac, attribute this answer to the Jews, i.e. those who were
seeking his life. If the reading, therefore, of οἱ Ιουδαιοι, the Jews,
be received instead of ὁ οχλος, the multitude, it serves to show the
malice of his enemies in a still stronger light: for, fearing lest their
wish to put him to death might not be gratified, and that his teaching
should prevail among the common people; to ruin his credit, and prevent
his usefulness, they give out that he was possessed by a demon; and
that, though he might be pitied as a miserable man, yet he must not be
attended to as a teacher of righteousness. Malice and envy are ever
active and indefatigable, leaving no stone unturned, no mean unused,
that they may win the object of their resentment. See the note on [Joh
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#026.md).

[John 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 7:21</span></span>

I have done one work - That of curing the impotent man, already referred
to. See [Joh 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#009.md).

And ye all marvel - or, ye all marvel because of this. Some have δια
τουτο, in connection with θαυμαζετε, which the common pointing makes the
beginning of the next verse, and which, in our common version, is
translated therefore; but this word conveys no meaning at all, in the
connection in which it is thus placed. Proof of this construction Kypke
gives from Themistius, Strabo, and Aelian. All the eminent critics are
on the side of this arrangement of the words.

[John 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 7:22</span></span>

But of the fathers - That is, it came from the patriarchs. Circumcision
was not, properly speaking, one of the laws of the Mosaic institution,
it having been given at first to Abraham, and continued among his
posterity till the giving of the law: [Gen
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#009.md), [Gen
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#010.md), etc.

Ye - circumcise a man - That is, a male child: for every male child was
circumcised when eight days old; and if the eighth day after its birth
happened to be a Sabbath, it was nevertheless circumcised, that the law
might not be broken, which had enjoined the circumcision to take place
at that time, [Lev 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#003.md). From this and
several other circumstances it is evident that the keeping of the
Sabbath, even in the strictest sense of the word, ever admitted of the
works of necessity and mercy to be done on it; and that those who did
not perform such works on that day, when they had opportunity, were
properly violators of every law founded on the principles of mercy and
justice. If the Jews had said, Why didst thou not defer the healing of
the sick man till the ensuing day? He might have well answered, Why do
ye not defer the circumcising of your children to the ensuing day, when
the eighth day happens to be a Sabbath? - which is a matter of
infinitely less consequence than the restoration of this long-afflicted
man.

[John 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 7:23</span></span>

Every whit whole - The law of circumcision required the removal of a
small portion of flesh, which was considered a blot and reproach among
the Hebrews, because it confounded them with the nations who were not in
covenant with God. Christ, to this, opposes the complete cure of the
infirm man, who was diseased throughout his whole body: if the one was
permitted on the Sabbath day, for the reason already alleged, surely the
other had stronger reasons to recommend it.

Some think that the original words, ὁλον ανθρωπον, should be translated,
the whole man; and that the meaning is, that the blessed Savior made him
whole both in body and soul. This makes the miracle the greater, and
shows still more forcibly the necessity of doing it without delay.

Battier ap. Wets. supposes that, instead of ὁλον, χωλον should be read -
I have made a Maimed man whole; but there is no countenance for this
reading in any of the MSS., versions, or fathers.

[John 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 7:24</span></span>

Judge not according to the appearance - Attend to the law, not merely in
the letter, but in its spirit and design. Learn that the law which
commands men to rest on the Sabbath day is subordinate to the law of
mercy and love, which requires them to be ever active to promote God's
glory in the comfort and salvation of their fellow creatures; and
endeavor to judge of the merit or demerit of an action, not from the
first impression it may make upon your prejudices but from its tendency,
and the motives of the person, as far as it is possible for you to
acquaint yourselves with them; still believing the best, where you have
no certain proof to the contrary.

[John 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 7:26</span></span>

That this is the very Christ? - In most of the common printed editions
αληθως is found, the Very Christ; but the word is wanting in BDKLTX,
twenty-two others, several editions; all the Arabic, Wheelock's Persic,
the Coptic, Sahidic, Armenian, Slavonic, Vulgate, and all the Itala but
one, Origen, Epiphanius, Cyril, Isidore, Pelusian, and Nonnus. Grotius,
Mill, Bengel, and Griesbach, decide against it. Bishop Pearce says, I am
of opinion that this second αληθως, in this verse, should be omitted, it
seeming quite unnecessary, if not inaccurate, when the words αληθως
εγνωσαν, had just preceded it.

Calmet observes that the multitude which heard our Lord at this time was
composed of three different classes of persons:

1\. The rulers, priests, and Pharisees, declared enemies of Christ.

2\. The inhabitants of Jerusalem, who knew the sentiments of their
rulers concerning him.

3\. The strangers, who from different quarters had come up to Jerusalem
to the feast, and who heard Christ attentively, being ignorant of the
designs of the rulers, etc., against him.

Our Lord addresses himself in this discourse principally to his enemies.
The strange Jews were those who were astonished when Christ said, [Joh
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#020.md), that they sought to kill him,
having no such design themselves, and not knowing that others had. And
the Jews of Jerusalem were those who, knowing the disposition of the
rulers, and seeing Christ speak openly, no man attempting to seize him,
addressed each other in the foregoing words, Do the rulers know indeed
that this is the Christ? imagining that the chief priests, etc., had at
last been convinced that Jesus was the Messiah.

[John 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 7:27</span></span>

No man knoweth whence he is - The generality of the people knew very
well that the Messiah was to be born in Bethlehem, in the city, and of
the family, of David; see [Joh 7:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#042.md).
But, from [Isa 53:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#008.md), Who shall declare
his generation? they probably thought that there should be something so
peculiarly mysterious in his birth, or in the manner of his appearing,
that no person could fully understand. Had they considered his
miraculous conception, they would have felt their minds relieved on this
point. The Jews thought that the Messiah, after his birth, would hide
himself for some considerable time; and that when he began to preach no
man should know where he had been hidden, and whence he had come. The
rabbins have the following proverb: Three things come unexpectedly:

1\. A thing found by chance.

2\. The sting of a scorpion: and,

3\. The Messiah.

It was probably in reference to the above that the people said, No man
knoweth whence he is. However, they might have spoken this of his
parents. We know that the Messiah is to be born in Bethlehem, of the
family of David; but no man can know his parents: therefore they
rejected him: [Joh 6:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#042.md), Is not this
Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know?

[John 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 7:28</span></span>

Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am - Perhaps they should be read
interrogatively: Do ye both know me, and know whence I am? Our Lord
takes them up on their own profession, and argues from it. Since you
have got so much information concerning me, add this to it, to make it
complete; viz. that I am not come of myself; am no self-created or
self-authorized prophet; I came from God: - the testimony of John the
Baptist, the descent of the Holy Ghost, the voice from heaven, the
purity and excellence of my doctrine, and the multitude of my miracles,
sufficiently attest this. Now, God is true who has borne testimony to
me; but ye know him not, therefore it is that this testimony is
disregarded.

[John 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 7:29</span></span>

But I know him: for I am from him - Instead of εἰμὶ, I am, some
editions, the Syriac Hieros. read εἷμι, I came, according to the Attics.
Nonnus confirms this reading by paraphrasing the word by εληλυθα, I
came. As the difference between the two words lies only in the accents,
and as these are not found in ancient MSS., it is uncertain which way
the word was understood by them: nor is the matter of much moment; both
words amount nearly to the same meaning and εἷμι, I came, seems too
refined.

[John 7:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 7:31</span></span>

Will he do more miracles - It was the belief of the Jews, and they
founded it upon [Isa 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#005.md), that, when
the Messiah came, he would do all kinds of miracles; and, in order that
they might have the fullest proof of the Divine mission of Christ, it
had pleased God to cause miracles to cease for between four and five
hundred years, and that John the Baptist himself had not wrought any.
His miracles, therefore, were a full proof of his Divine mission.

[John 7:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joh 7:32</span></span>

The people murmured such things - The people began to be convinced that
he was the Messiah; and this being generally whispered about, the
Pharisees, etc., thought it high time to put him to death, lest the
people should believe on him; therefore they sent officers to take him.

[John 7:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 7:33</span></span>

Yet a little while am I with you - As he knew that the Pharisees had
designed to take and put him to death, and that in about six months from
this time, as some conjecture, he should be crucified, he took the
present opportunity of giving this information to the common people, who
were best disposed towards him, that they might lay their hearts to his
teaching, and profit by it, while they had the privilege of enjoying it.

The word αυτοις, to them, in the beginning of this verse, is wanting in
BDEGHLMS, more than eighty others, both the Syriac, later Persic,
Coptic, Sahidic, Armenian, Gothic, Slavonic, Saxon, most copies of the
Vulgate and the Itala. It is omitted also by Euthymius, Theophylact,
Augustin, and Bede. Our Lord did not speak these words to the officers
who came to apprehend him, as αυτοις here implies, but to the common
people, merely to show that he was not ignorant of the designs of the
Pharisees, though they had not yet been able to put them into practice.

[John 7:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">joh 7:34</span></span>

Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me - When the Roman armies come
against you, you will vainly seek for a deliverer. But ye shall be cut
off in your sins, because ye did not believe in me; and where I am - in
the kingdom of glory, ye cannot come; for nothing that is unholy shall
enter into the new Jerusalem. In this, and the thirty-sixth verse, εἰμὶ,
I am, is read by several εἷμι, I came, as in the twenty-ninth verse; and
in these two last places the Ethiopic, Arabic, three copies of the
Itala, Nonnus, and Theophylact, agree. See the note on [Joh
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#029.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 7:35</span></span>

The dispersed among the Gentiles - Or Greeks. By the dispersed, are
meant here the Jews who were scattered through various parts of that
empire which Alexander the Great had founded, in Greece, Syria, Egypt,
and Asia Minor, where the Greek language was used, and where the Jewish
Scriptures in the Greek version of the Septuagint were read. Others
suppose that the Gentiles themselves are meant - others, that the ten
tribes which had been long lost are here intended.

[John 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 7:37</span></span>

In the last day, that great day of the feast - This was the eighth day,
and was called the great day, because of certain traditional
observances, and not on account of any excellence which it derived from
the original institution. On the seven days they professed to offer
sacrifices for the seventy nations of the earth, but on the eighth day
they offered sacrifices for Israel; therefore the eighth day was more
highly esteemed than any of the others. It is probably to this that the
evangelist refers when he calls the last day the great day of the feast.
See the account of the feast of tabernacles, in the note on [Joh
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#002) (note.md). It was probably when they
went to draw water from the pool Siloam, and while they were pouring it
out at the foot of the altar, that our Lord spoke these words; for, as
that ceremony pointed out the gracious influences of the Holy Spirit,
our Lord, who was the fountain whence it was to proceed, called the
people to himself, that, by believing on him, they might be made
partakers of that inestimable benefit.

[John 7:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">joh 7:38</span></span>

He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath said - He who receives me
as the Messiah, according to what the Scripture has said concerning me;
my person, birth, conduct, preaching, and miracles, being compared with
what is written there as ascertaining the true Messiah. Out of his belly
- from his heart and soul; for in his soul shall this Spirit dwell.

Living water - As a true spring is ever supplied with water from the
great deep, with which it has communication, so shall the soul of the
genuine believer be supplied with light, life, love, and liberty, and
all the other graces of the indwelling Spirit, from the indwelling
Christ. The Jews frequently compare the gifts and influences of the Holy
Spirit to water in general - to rain, fountains, wells, rivers, etc.,
etc. The Scriptures abound in this metaphor. [Psa
36:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#008.md), [Psa
36:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#009.md); [Isa
44:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#003.md), [Isa

Was not yet given - Δεδομενον, given is added by the Codex Vaticanus,
(B.) the Syriac, all the Persic, later Syriac with an asterisk, three
copies of the Slavonic, Vulgate, and all the Itala but three; and
several of the primitive fathers. The word seems necessary to the
completion of the sense.

Certain measures of the Holy Spirit had been vouchsafed from the
beginning of the world to believers and unbelievers: but that abundant
effusion of his graces spoken of by Joel, [Joe
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#028.md), which peculiarly characterized
the Gospel times, was not granted till after the ascension of Christ:

1\. Because this Spirit in its plenitude was to come in consequence of
his atonement; and therefore could not come till after his crucifixion.

2\. It was to supply the place of Christ to his disciples and to all
true believers; and therefore it was not necessary till after the
removal of his bodily presence from among them. See our Lord's own
words, [Joh 14:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#016.md), [Joh
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#026.md); [Joh

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">joh 7:40</span></span>

Of a truth this is the Prophet - The great prophet, or teacher, spoken
of by Moses, [Deu 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015.md), which they
improperly distinguished from the Messiah, [Joh
7:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#041.md). Some no doubt knew that by the
prophet, the Messiah was meant; but others seem to have thought that one
of the ancient prophets should be raised from the dead, and precede the
appearing of the Messiah.

[John 7:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">joh 7:41</span></span>

Shalt Christ come out of Galilee? - As the prophets had declared that
the Messiah was to come from the tribe of Judah, and from the family of
David, and should be born in the city of Bethlehem, these Jews,
imagining that Christ had been born in Galilee, concluded that he could
not be the Messiah. Had they examined the matter a little farther, they
would have found that he had his birth exactly as the prophets had
foretold; but, for want of this necessary examination, they continued in
unbelief, and rejected the Lord that bought them. Many still lose their
souls nearly in the same way. They suffer themselves to be led away by
common report, and become prejudiced against the truth, refuse to give
it a fair hearing, or to examine for themselves. It is on this ground
that deism and irreligion have established themselves, and still
maintain their posts.

[John 7:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">joh 7:42</span></span>

Where David was? - That is, where he was born, [Sa1
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#001.md), [Sa1
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#004.md), and where he was before he
became king in Israel.

There was a division - Σχισμα, a schism; they were divided in sentiment,
and separated into parties. This is the true notion of schism.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">joh 7:44</span></span>

Would have taken him - Or, they wished to seize him. And this they would
have done, and destroyed him too at that time, had they been unanimous;
but their being divided in opinion, [Joh
7:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#043.md), was the cause, under God, why
his life was at that time preserved. How true are the words of the
prophet: The wrath of man shall praise thee; and the remainder thereof
thou wilt restrain! [Psa 76:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#010.md).

[John 7:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">joh 7:45</span></span>

Then came the officers - They had followed him for several days, seeking
for a proper opportunity to seize on him, when they might fix some
charge of sedition, etc., upon him; but the more they listened, the more
they were convinced of his innocence, purity, and consummate wisdom.

[John 7:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">joh 7:46</span></span>

Never man spake like this man - Though these officers had gone on the
errand of their masters, they had not entered into their spirit. They
were sent to apprehend a seditious man, and a false prophet. They came
where Jesus taught; they found him to be a different person to the
description they received from their masters, and therefore did not
attempt to touch or molest him. No doubt they expected when they told
their employers the truth, that they would have commended them, and
acknowledged their own mistake: but these simple people were not in the
secret of their masters' malice. They heard, they felt, that no man ever
spoke with so much grace, power, majesty, and eloquence. They had never
heard a discourse so affecting and persuasive. So Jesus still speaks to
all who are simple of heart. He speaks pardon - he speaks holiness - he
speaks salvation to all who have ears to hear. No man ever did or can
speak as he does. He teaches The Truth, the whole Truth, and nothing but
the Truth.

[John 7:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">joh 7:48</span></span>

Have any of the rulers - believed on him? - Very few. But is this a
proof that he is not of God? No, truly. If he were of the world, the
world would love its own. The religion of Christ has been in general
rejected by the rulers of this world. A life of mortification,
self-denial, and humility, does not comport with the views of those who
will have their portion in this life. It has ever been a mark of the
truth of God that the great, the mighty, and the wise have in general
rejected it. They are too much occupied with this world to attend to the
concerns of the next.

[John 7:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">joh 7:49</span></span>

This people - Ὁ οχλος, This rabble. The common people were treated by
the Pharisees with the most sovereign contempt: they were termed עם הארץ
am ha-arets, people of the earth; and were not thought worthy to have a
resurrection to eternal life. Wagenseil and Schoettgen have given many
proofs of the contempt in which the common people were held by the
Pharisees. Those who were disciples of any of the rabbins were
considered as being in a much better state. When they paid well, they
purchased their masters' good opinion.

[John 7:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">joh 7:50</span></span>

Nicodemus - being one of them - That is, a Pharisee, and a ruler of the
Jews: see on [Joh 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#001) (note.md).

[John 7:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">joh 7:51</span></span>

Doth our law judge any man - Τον ανθρωπον, the man, i.e. who is accused.
Perhaps Nicodemus did not refer so much to any thing in the law of
Moses, as to what was commonly practiced among them. Josephus says, Ant.
b. xiv. c. 9. s. 3, That the law has forbidden any man to be put to
death, though wicked, unless he be first condemned to die by the
Sanhedrin. It was probably to this law, which is not expressly mentioned
in the five books of Moses, that Nicodemus here alludes. See laws
relative to this point, [Deu 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#008.md),
etc.; [Deu 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#015.md).

[John 7:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">joh 7:52</span></span>

Art thou also of Galilee? - They knew very well that he was not; but
they spoke this by way of reproach. As if they had said, thou art no
better than he is, as thou takest his part. Many of the Galileans had
believed on him, Which the Jews considered to be a reproach. Art thou
his disciple, as the Galileans are?

Search, and look - Examine the Scriptures, search the public registers,
and thou wilt see that out of Galilee there ariseth no prophet. Neither
the Messiah, nor any other prophet, has ever proceeded from Galilee, nor
ever can. This conclusion, says Calmet, was false and impertinent:
false, because Jonah was of Gathheper, in Galilee: see [Kg2
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025.md), compared with [Jos
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#013.md). The Prophet Nahum was also a
Galilean, for he was of the tribe of Simeon; and some suppose that
Malachi was of the same place. The conclusion was false, because there
not having been a prophet from any particular place was no argument that
there never could be one, as the place had not been proscribed.

[John 7:53](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">joh 7:53</span></span>

And every man went, etc. - The authority and influence of Nicodemus, in
this case, was so great that the Sanhedrin broke up without being able
to conclude any thing. As the feast was now ended, they were not obliged
to continue any longer in or about Jerusalem; and therefore all returned
to their respective dwellings.

This verse and the first eleven verses of the following chapter are
wanting in several MSS. Some of those which retain the paragraph mark it
with obelisks, as a proof of spuriousness. Those which do retain it have
it with such a variety of reading as is no where else found in the
sacred writings. Professor Griesbach leaves the whole paragraph in the
text with notes of doubtfulness. Most of the modern critics consider it
as resting on no solid authority.
