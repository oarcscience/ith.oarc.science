### [Joshua Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#001.md)

[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jos 16:0</span></span>

Borders of the children of Joseph, [Jos
16:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#001.md). The borders of the
Ephraimites, [Jos 16:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#005.md). The
Canaanites dwell tributary among them, [Jos
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#010.md).

[Joshua 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 16:1</span></span>

The children of Joseph - Ephraim and Manasseh, and their descendants.
The limits of the tribe of Ephraim extended along the borders of
Benjamin and Dan, from Jordan on the east to the Mediterranean on the
west.

[Joshua 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 16:2</span></span>

From Bethel to Luz - From [Gen 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#019.md)
(note) it appears that the place which Jacob called Beth-el was formerly
called Luz; see the note there: but here they seem to be two distinct
places. It is very likely that the place where Jacob had the vision was
not in Luz, but in some place within a small distance of that city or
village, (see the note on [Gen 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#012).md),
and that sometimes the whole place was called Beth-el, at other times
Luz, and sometimes, as in the case above, the two places were
distinguished. As we find the term London comprises, not only London,
but also the city of Westminster and the borough of Southwark; though at
other times all three are distinctly mentioned.

Archi to Ataroth - Archi was the country of Hushai, the friend of David,
[Sa2 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#032.md), who is called Hushai the
Archite. Ataroth, called Ataroth-addar, Ataroth the illustrious, [Jos
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#005.md), and simply Ataroth, [Jos
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#007.md), is supposed to have been about
fifteen miles from Jerusalem.

[Joshua 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 16:3</span></span>

Beth-horon the nether - This city was about twelve miles from Jerusalem,
on the side of Nicopolis, formerly Emmaus. - Calmet. See the note on
[Jos 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#010.md).

[Joshua 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 16:5</span></span>

Ataroth-addar - See the note on [Jos
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#002.md).

Beth-horon the upper - The situation of this town is little known. It
was eastward of Beth-horon the nether, and consequently not far from it.

[Joshua 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jos 16:8</span></span>

Tappuah - This was a city in the tribe of Manasseh, and gave name to a
certain district called the land of Tappuah. See [Jos
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#008.md).

The sea - The Mediterranean, as before.

[Joshua 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 16:9</span></span>

And the separate cities - That is, the cities that were separated from
the tribe of Manasseh to be given to Ephraim; see [Jos
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#009.md).

[Joshua 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 16:10</span></span>

The Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer - It appears that the Canaanites were
not expelled from this city till the days of Solomon, when it was taken
by the king of Egypt his father-in-law, who made it a present to his
daughter, Solomon's queen. See [Kg1
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#016.md). And see the note on [Jos
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#033.md). The Ephraimites, however, had
so far succeeded in subjecting these people as to oblige them to pay
tribute, though they could not, or at least did not, totally expel them.

Of the names and places in this chapter, we may say the same as of
others already mentioned. See the note on [Jos
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#001.md). Many of those towns were small,
and, we may rationally conclude, slightly built, and consequently have
perished perhaps more than a thousand years ago. It would be therefore
useless to look for such places now. Several of the towns in England, a
land not exposed to such revolutions as that of Palestine has ever been,
mentioned by Caesar and other ancient writers, are no longer
discernible. Several have changed their names, and not a few their
situation. Tradition states that the city of Norwich anciently stood
some miles from its present situation; and we have the fullest proof
that this was the case with the city of Salisbury. Such changes do not
affect the truth of the ancient geography of our own country; nor can
they impeach that of the sacred historian before us.
