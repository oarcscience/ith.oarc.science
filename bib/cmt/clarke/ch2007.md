### [2 Chronicles Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 7:0</span></span>

Solomon having ended his prayer, the fire of the Lord comes down from
heaven and consumes the offerings, [Ch2
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#001). The people and the priests see
this, and glorify God, and offer sacrifices, [Ch2
7:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#002). Solomon offers twenty-two
thousand oxen, and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep; and the
priests and Levites attend in their offices, [Ch2
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#005), [Ch2
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#006). He keeps the feast seven days,
and the dedication of the altar seven days, and dismisses the people,
[Ch2 7:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#007). The Lord appears unto him
by night, and assures him that he has heard his prayer, [Ch2
7:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#012); promises him and his
posterity a perpetual government, if they be obedient, [Ch2
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#017), [Ch2
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#018); but utter destruction should
they disobey, and become idolaters, [Ch2
7:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#019).

[2 Chronicles 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 7:1</span></span>

The fire came down - The cloud had come down before, now the fire
consumes the sacrifice, showing that both the house and the sacrifices
were accepted by the Lord.

[2 Chronicles 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 7:4</span></span>

The king and all the people offered sacrifices - They presented the
victims to the priests, and they and the Levites slew them, and
sprinkled the blood: or perhaps the people themselves slew them; and,
having caught the blood, collected the fat, etc., presented them to the
priests to be offered as the law required.

[2 Chronicles 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 7:5</span></span>

Twenty and two thousand oxen, etc. - The amount of all the victims that
had been offered during the seven days of the feast of tabernacles, and
the seven days of the feast of the dedication.

[2 Chronicles 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 7:8</span></span>

The entering in of Hamath - "From the entrance of Antioch to the Nile of
Egypt." - Targum.

[2 Chronicles 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 7:10</span></span>

On the three and twentieth day - This was the ninth day of the
dedication of the temple; but in [Kg1
8:66](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#066) it is called the eighth day. "The
meaning is this," says Jarchi: "he gave them liberty to return on the
eighth day, and many of them did then return: and he dismissed the
remainder on the ninth, what is called here the twenty-third, reckoning
the fourteen days for the duration of the two feasts; in all,
twenty-three."

The Targum paraphrases this verse thus: "The people departed with a glad
heart, for all the good which God had done to David his servant, on
whose account the doors of the sanctuary were open and for Solomon his
son, because God had heard his prayer, and the majesty of the Lord had
rested on the house of the sanctuary and for Israel, his people, because
God had favourably accepted their oblations, and the heavenly fire had
descended, and, burning on the altar, had devoured their sacrifices."

[2 Chronicles 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 7:12</span></span>

The Lord appeared to Solomon - This was a second manifestation; see [Kg1
9:2-9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#002) (note), and the notes there. The
Targum says, "The Word of the Lord appeared to Solomon."

[2 Chronicles 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 7:13</span></span>

Or if I send pestilence - "The angel of death." - Targum.

[2 Chronicles 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 7:15</span></span>

Now mine eyes shall be open - It shall be pleasing to me in the sight of
my Word, that I should incline mine ear," etc. - Targum.

[2 Chronicles 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 7:18</span></span>

There shall not fail thee a man - This promise was not fulfilled,
because the condition was not fulfilled; they forsook God, and he cut
them off, and the throne also.

[2 Chronicles 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 7:20</span></span>

Then will I pluck them up by the roots - How completely has this been
fulfilled! not only all the branches of the Jewish political tree have
been cut off, but the very roots have been plucked up; so that the day
of the Lord's anger has left them neither root nor branch.

[2 Chronicles 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 7:21</span></span>

Shall be an astonishment - The manner in which these disobedient people
have been destroyed is truly astonishing: no nation was ever so highly
favored, and none ever so severely and signally punished.

[2 Chronicles 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch2 7:22</span></span>

Because they forsook the Lord - While they cleaved to God, the most
powerful enemy could make no impression on them; but when they forsook
him, then the weakest and most inconsiderable of their foes harassed,
oppressed, and reduced them to bondage and misery. It was by no personal
prowess, genuine heroism, or supereminent military tactics, that the
Jews were enabled to resist and overcome their enemies; it was by the
Divine power alone; for, destitute of this, they were even worse than
other men.
