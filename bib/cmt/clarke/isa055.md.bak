### [Isaiah Chapter 55](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 55:0</span></span>

This chapter first displays the fullness, freeness, excellence, and
everlasting nature of the blessings of the Gospel, and foretells again
the enlargement of Messiah's kingdom, [Isa
55:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001.md). This view leads the prophet to
exhort all to seize the precious opportunity of sharing in such
blessings, which were not, however, to be expected without repentance
and reformation, [Isa 55:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#006.md), [Isa
55:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#007.md). And as the things now and
formerly predicted were so great as to appear incredible, the prophet
points to the omnipotence of God, who would infallibly accomplish his
word, and bring about those glorious deliverances which he had promised;
the happy effects of which are again set forth by images beautiful and
poetical in the highest degree, [Isa
55:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#008.md).

[Isaiah 55:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 55:1</span></span>

Ho, every one that thirsteth - "Water," says Zimchi, "is a metaphor for
the law and wisdom: as the world cannot subsist without water, so it is
impossible that it can subsist without wisdom. The law is also compared
to wine and milk: to wine because wine rejoiceth the heart, as it is
written: 'The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart,' [Psa
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#008.md). It is compared also to milk,
because milk is the subsistence of the child; so are the words of the
law the nourishment of his soul who walks in the Divine teaching, and
grows up under it."

Come, buy wine and milk - In ancient times our forefathers used what is
now called the old third person singular, ending in eth, for the
imperative mood. We have a fine example of His in the first verses of
this chapter. I shall present them as they stand in my old MS. Bible: -
Alle gee thirstinge cummeth to wateris: and gee that han not sylver,
goth forth and bieth, and etith. Cummeth, bieth without silver, and
without eny chaungyng, wyn and mylc. Heerith gee, heering me and etith
gode thinge, and deliten schal in fattnesse your soule. Bowith in your
eie and cummeth to mee, heerith and liven schal your soule. And I shall
smyten with gou, everlastynge covenant, the faithful mercies of David.

[Isaiah 55:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 55:2</span></span>

Wherefore do ye spend - Why should ye be so zealously attached to a
doctrine from which your souls derive neither comfort nor nourishment?

[Isaiah 55:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 55:3</span></span>

I will make an everlasting covenant - Hebrews אכרתה לכם ברית עולם
echrethah lachem berith olam, "I will cut the old or everlasting
covenant sacrifice with you." That covenant sacrifice which was pointed
out of old from the very beginning; and which is to last to the
consummation of ages; viz., the Lamb of God that was slain from the
foundation of the world.

The sure mercies of David - That is, says Kimchi, "The Messiah," called
here David; as it is written, "David my servant shall be a prince over
you."

[Isaiah 55:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 55:6</span></span>

Seek ye the Lord while he may be found - Rab. David Kimchi gives the
true sense of this passage: "Seek ye the Lord, because he may be found:
call upon him, because he is near. Repent before ye die, for after death
there is no conversion of the soul."

[Isaiah 55:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 55:9</span></span>

For as the heavens are higher - I am persuaded that כ caph, the particle
of comparison, is lost in this place, from the likeness of the particle
כי ki, immediately preceding it. So Houbigant and Secker. And their
remark is confirmed by all the ancient Versions, which express it; and
by the following passage of [Psa
103:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#011.md), which is almost the same: -

הארץ על שמים כגבה כי haarets al shamayim chigboah ki יראיו על חסדו גבר
yereaiv al chasdo gabar

"For as the heavens are high above the earth,

So high is his goodness over them that fear him."

Where, by the nature of the sentence, the verb in the second line ought
to be the same with that in the first; גבה gabah, not גבר gabar: so
Archbishop Secker conjectured; referring however to [Psa
117:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa117.htm#002.md).

[Isaiah 55:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 55:12</span></span>

The mountains and the hills - These are highly poetical images to
express a happy state attended with joy and exultation.

Ipsi laetitia voces ad sidera jactant

Intonsi montes: ipsae jam carmina rupes,

Ipsa sonant arbusta.

Virg. Ecl. 5:61.

"The mountain tops unshorn, the rocks rejoice;

The lowly shrubs partake of human voice."

Dryden.

[Isaiah 55:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 55:13</span></span>

Instead of the thorn "Instead of the thorny bushes" - These likewise
(see note on [Isa 55:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#012.md), and on [Isa
54:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#011) (note).md) are general poetical
images, expressing a great and happy change for the better. The
wilderness turned into a paradise, Lebanon into Carmel: the desert of
the Gentiles watered with the heavenly snow and rain, which fail not to
have their due effect, and becoming fruitful in piety and righteousness:
or, as the Chaldee gives the moral sense of the emblem, "instead of the
wicked shall arise the just; and instead of sinners, such as fear to
sin." Compare [Isa 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001.md), [Isa
35:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#002.md); [Isa
41:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#019.md).

And instead of - The conjunction ו vau is added, ותחת vetachath, in
forty-five MSS. of Kennicott's several of De Rossi's, and five editions;
and it is acknowledged by all the ancient Versions. The Masoretes
therefore might have safely received it into the text, and not have
referred us for it to the margin. But this is no uncommon case with
them. Even in our own Version the best reading is very often found in
the margin.
