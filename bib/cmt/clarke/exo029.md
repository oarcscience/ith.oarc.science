### [Exodus Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#001)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 29:0</span></span>

Ceremonies to be used in consecrating Aaron and his sons, [Exo
29:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#001). They are to be washed, [Exo
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#004). Aaron is to be clothed with the
holy vestments, [Exo 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#005), [Exo
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#006); to be anointed, [Exo
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#007). His sons to be clothed and
girded, [Exo 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#008), [Exo
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#009). They are to offer a bullock for
a sin-offering, [Exo 29:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#010); and a
ram for a burnt-offering, [Exo
29:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#015); and a second ram for a
consecration-offering, [Exo 29:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#019).
A loaf, a cake, and a wafer or thin cake, for a wave-offering, [Exo
29:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#023). The breast of the
wave-offering and the shoulder of the heave-offering to be sanctified,
[Exo 29:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#026). Aaron's vestments to
descend to his son, who shall succeed him, [Exo
29:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#029), [Exo
29:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#030). Aaron and his sons to eat the
flesh of the ram of consecration, [Exo
29:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#031), [Exo
29:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#032). No stranger to eat of it, [Exo
29:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#033). Nothing of it to be left till
the morning, but to be burnt with fire, [Exo
29:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#034). Seven days to be employed in
consecrating Aaron and his sons, [Exo
29:35-37](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#035). Two lambs, one for the
morning and the other for the evening sacrifice, to be offered
continually, [Exo 29:38-42](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#038). God
promises to sanctify Israel with his glory, and to dwell among them,
[Exo 29:43-46](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#043).

[Exodus 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 29:1</span></span>

Take one young bullock - This consecration did not take place till after
the erection of the tabernacle. See [Lev
8:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#009).

[Exodus 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 29:2</span></span>

Unleavened bread - Three kinds of bread as to its form are mentioned
here, but all unleavened:

1\. מצות matstsoth, unleavened bread, no matter in what shape. See [Exo
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#008).

2\. חלת challoth, cakes, pricked or perforated, as the root implies.

3\. רקיקי rekikey, an exceeding thin cake, from רק rak, to be
attenuated, properly enough translated wafer. The manner in which these
were prepared is sufficiently plain from the text, and probably these
were the principal forms in which flour was prepared for household use
during their stay in the wilderness.

These were all waved before the Lord, [Exo
29:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#024), as an acknowledgment that the
bread that sustains the body, as well as the mercy which saves the soul,
comes from God alone.

[Exodus 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 29:4</span></span>

Thou - shalt wash them - This was done emblematically, to signify that
they were to put away all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, and
perfect holiness in the fear of God; [Co2
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#001).

[Exodus 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 29:5</span></span>

Thou shalt take the garments - As most offices of spiritual and secular
dignity had appropriate habits and insignia, hence, when a person was
appointed to an office and habited for the purpose, he was said to be
invested with that office, from in, used intensively, and vestio, I
clothe, because he was then clothed with the vestments peculiar to that
office.

[Exodus 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 29:7</span></span>

Then shalt thou take the anointing oil - It appears, from [Isa
61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001), that anointing with oil, in
consecrating a person to any important office, whether civil or
religious, was considered as an emblem of the communication of the gifts
and graces of the Holy Spirit. This ceremony was used on three
occasions, viz., the installation of prophets, priests, and kings, into
their respective offices. But why should such an anointing be deemed
necessary? Because the common sense of men taught them that all good,
whether spiritual or secular, must come from God, its origin and cause.
Hence it was taken for granted,

1\. That no man could foretell events unless inspired by the Spirit of
God. And therefore the prophet was anointed, to signify the
communication of the Spirit of wisdom and knowledge.

2\. That no person could offer an acceptable sacrifice to God for the
sins of men, or profitably minister in holy things, unless enlightened,
influenced, and directed by the Spirit of grace and holiness. Hence the
priest was anointed, to signify his being Divinely qualified for the due
performance of his sacred functions.

3\. That no man could enact just and equitable laws, which should have
the prosperity of the community and the welfare of the individual
continually in view, or could use the power confided to him only for the
suppression of vice and the encouragement of virtue, but that man who
was ever under the inspiration of the Almighty.

Hence kings were inaugurated by anointing with oil. Two of these
officers only exist in all civilized nations, the sacerdotal and regal;
and in some countries the priest and king are still consecrated by
anointing. In the Hebrew language משח mashach signifies to anoint, and
משיח mashiach, the anointed person. But as no man was ever dignified by
holding the three offices, so no person ever had the title mashiach, the
anointed one, but Jesus the Christ. He alone is King of kings and Lord
of lords: the king who governs the universe, and rules in the hearts of
his followers; the prophet, to instruct men in the way wherein they
should go; and the great high priest, to make atonement for their sins.
Hence he is called the Messias, a corruption of the word המשיח
hammashiach, The anointed One, in Hebrew; which gave birth to ὁ Χριστος,
ho Christos, which has precisely the same signification in Greek. Of
him, Melchizedek, Abraham, Aaron, David, and others were illustrious
types. But none of these had the title of The Messiah, or The Anointed
of God. This does, and ever will, belong exclusively to Jesus the
Christ.

[Exodus 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 29:10</span></span>

Shall put their hands upon the head of the bullock - By this rite the
animal was consecrated to God, and was then proper to be offered in
sacrifice. Imposition of hands also signified that they offered the life
of this animal as an atonement for their sins, and to redeem their lives
from that death which, through their sinfulness, they had deserved. In
the case of the sin-offering and trespass-offering, the person who
brought the sacrifice placed his hands on the head of the animal between
the horns, and confessed his sin over the sin-offering, and his trespass
over the trespass-offering, saying, "I have sinned, I have done
iniquity; I have trespassed, and have done thus and thus; and do return
by repentance before thee, and with this I make atonement." Then the
animal was considered as vicariously bearing the sins of the person who
brought it - [Exo 29:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#014)

[Exodus 29:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 29:14</span></span>

It is a sin-offering - See Clarke's note on [Gen
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#007); See Clarke's note on [Gen
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#013); See Clarke's note on [Lev
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#001), etc.

[Exodus 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 29:18</span></span>

It is a burnt-offering - See Clarke's note on [Lev
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#001), etc.

[Exodus 29:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">exo 29:19</span></span>

The other ram - There were two rams brought on this occasion: one was
for a burnt-offering, and was to be entirely consumed; the other was the
ram of consecration, [Exo 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#022), איל
מלאים eil milluim, the ram of filling up, because when a person was
dedicated or consecrated to God, his hands were filled with some
particular offering proper for the occasion, which he presented to God.
Hence the word consecration signifies the filling up or filling the
hands, some part of the sacrifice being put into the hands of such
persons, denoting thereby that they had now a right to offer sacrifices
and oblations to God. It seems in reference to this ancient mode of
consecration, that in the Church of England, when a person is ordained
priest, a Bible is put into his hands with these words, "Take thou
authority to preach the word of God, etc. The filling the hands refers
also to the presents which, in the eastern countries, every inferior was
obliged to bring when brought into the presence of a superior. Thus the
sacrifice was considered, not only as an atonement for sin, but also as
a means of approach and as a present to Jehovah.

[Exodus 29:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 29:20</span></span>

Take of his blood - The putting the blood of the sacrifice on the tip of
the right ear, the thumb of the right hand, and the great toe of the
right foot, was doubtless intended to signify that they should dedicate
all their faculties and powers to the service of God; their ears to the
hearing and study of his law, their hands to diligence in the sacred
ministry and to all acts of obedience, and their feet to walking in the
way of God's precepts. And this sprinkling appears to have been used to
teach them that they could neither hear, work, nor walk profitably,
uprightly, and well-pleasing in the sight of God, without this
application of the blood of the sacrifice. And as the blood of rams,
bulls, and goats, could never take away sin, does not this prove to us
that something infinitely better is shadowed out, and that we can do
nothing holy and pure in the sight of a just and holy God, but through
the blood of atonement? See Clarke's note on [Exo
30:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#020).

[Exodus 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 29:22</span></span>

The fat and the rump - The rump or tail of some of the eastern sheep is
the best part of the animal, and is counted a great delicacy. They are
also very large, some of them weighing from twelve to forty pounds'
weight; "so that the owners," says Mr. Ludolf, in his History of
Ethiopia, "are obliged to tie a little cart behind them, whereon they
put the tail of the sheep, as well for the convenience of carriage, and
to ease the poor creature, as to preserve the wool from dirt, and the
tail from being torn among the bushes and stones." An engraving of this
kind of sheep, his tall, cart, etc., may be seen at p. 53 of the above
work.

[Exodus 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">exo 29:23</span></span>

And one loaf of bread - The bread of different kinds, (see Clarke on
[Exo 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#002) (note)), in this offering,
seems to have been intended as a minchah, or offering of grateful
acknowledgment for providential blessings. The essence of worship
consisted in acknowledging God,

1\. As the Creator, Governor, and Preserver of all things, and the
Dispenser of every good and perfect gift.

2\. As the Judge of men, the Punisher of sin, and he who alone could
pardon it.

The minchahs, heave-offerings, wave-offerings, and thank-offerings,
referred to the first point. The burnt-offerings, sin-offerings, and
sacrifices in general, referred to the second.

[Exodus 29:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">exo 29:24</span></span>

For a wave-offering - See Clarke's note on [Lev
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#001) etc., where an ample account of
all the offerings, sacrifices, etc., under the Mosaic dispensation, and
the reference they bore to the great sacrifice offered by Christ, is
given in detail.

[Exodus 29:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">exo 29:25</span></span>

Thou shalt receive them of their hands - Aaron and his sons are here
considered merely as any common persons bringing an offering to God, and
not having, as yet, any authority to present it themselves, but through
the medium of a priest. Moses, therefore, was now to Aaron and his sons
what they were afterwards to the children of Israel; and as the minister
of God he now consecrates them to the sacred office, and presents their
offerings to Jehovah.

[Exodus 29:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">exo 29:27</span></span>

The breast of the wave-offering, and the shoulder of the heave-offering
- As the wave-offering was agitated to and fro, and the heave-offering
up and down, some have conceived that this twofold action represented
the figure of the cross, on which the great Peace-offering between God
and man was offered in the personal sacrifice of our blessed Redeemer.
Had we authority for this conjecture, it would certainly cast much light
on the meaning and intention of these offerings; and when the
intelligent reader is informed that one of the most judicious critics in
the whole republic of letters is the author of this conjecture, viz.,
Houbigant, he will treat it with respect. I shall here produce his own
words on this verse:

Hic distinguuntur, תנופה et תרומה, ut ejusdem oblationis caeremoniae
duae. In תנופה significatur, moveri oblatam victimam huc et illuc, ad
dextram et ad sinistram. In תרומה sursum tolli, et sublatam rursus
deprimi; nam pluribus vicibus id fiebat. Rem sic interpretantur Judaei;
et Christianos docent, quanquam id non agentes, sic adumbrari eam
crucem, in quam generis humani victima illa pacifica sublata est, quam
veteres victimae omnes praenunciabant.

"The heave-offering and wave-offering, as two ceremonies in the same
oblation, are here distinguished. The wave-offering implies that the
victim was moved hither and thither, to the right hand and to the left;
the heave-offering was lifted up and down, and this was done several
times. In this way the Jews explain these things, and teach the
Christians, that by these acts the cross was adumbrated, upon which that
Peace-offering of the human race was lifted up which was prefigured by
all the ancient victims."

The breast and the shoulder, thus waved and heaved, were by this
consecration appointed to be the priests' portion for ever; and this, as
Mr. Ainsworth piously remarks, "taught the priests how, with all their
heart and all their strength, they should give themselves unto the
service of the Lord in his Church." Moses, as priest, received on this
occasion the breast and the shoulder, which became afterwards the
portion of the priests; see [Exo
29:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#028), and [Lev
7:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#034). It is worthy of remark, that
although Moses himself had no consecration to the sacerdotal office, yet
he acts here as high priest, consecrates a high priest, and receives the
breast and the shoulder, which were the priests' portion! But Moses was
an extraordinary messenger, and derived his authority, without the
medium of rites or ceremonies, immediately from God himself. It does not
appear that Christ either baptized the twelve apostles, or ordained them
by imposition of hands; yet, from his own infinite sufficiency, he gave
them authority both to baptize, and to lay on hands, in appointing
others to the work of the sacred ministry. [Exo
29:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#029)

[Exodus 29:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">exo 29:29</span></span>

The holy garments - shall be his son's after him - These garments were
to descend from father to son, and no new garments were to be made.

[Exodus 29:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">exo 29:30</span></span>

Seven days - The priest in his consecration was to abide seven days and
nights at the door of the tabernacle, keeping the Lord's watch. See [Lev
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#033), etc. The number seven is what is
called among the Hebrews a number of perfection; and it is often used to
denote the completion, accomplishment, fullness, or perfection of a
thing, as this period contained the whole course of that time in which
God created the world, and appointed the day of rest. As this act of
consecration lasted seven days, it signified a perfect consecration: and
intimated to the priest that his whole body and soul, his time and
talents, should be devoted to the service of God and his people.

The number seven, which was a sacred number among the Hebrews, was
conveyed from them down to the Greeks by means of the Egyptian
philosophy, from which they borrowed most of their mysteries; and it is
most likely that the opinion which the Greeks give is the same that the
original framers of the idea had. That there was some mystical idea
attached to it, is evident from its being made the number of perfection
among the Hebrews. Philo and Josephus say that the Essenes, an ancient
sect of the Jews, held it sacred "because it results from the side of a
square added to those of a triangle." But what meaning does this convey?
A triangle, or triad, according to the Pythagoreans, who borrowed their
systems from the Egyptians, who borrowed from the Jews, was the emblem
of wisdom, as consisting of beginning (Monad), middle (Duad), and end
(Triad itself); so wisdom consists of three parts - experience of the
past, attention to the present, and judgment of the future. It is also
the most penetrating of all forms, as being the shape of the wedge; and
indestructibility is essential to it, as a triangle can never be
destroyed. From those three properties it was the emblem of spirit. The
square, solid, and tetrad, by the same system were interchangeable
signs. Now a square is the representation of a solid or matter, and thus
the number seven contains within itself the properties of both the
triangle or solid, and the square or tetrad, i.e., is all emblem of body
and spirit; comprehends both the intellectual and natural world;
embraces the idea of God, the chief of spirits or essences; and all
nature, the result of his power; thus a very fit emblem of perfection.
It is perhaps in this way that we must explain what Cicero, Tusc.
Quest., lib. i., cap. 10, says of the number seven, where he calls it
the knot and cement of all things; as being that by which the natural
and spiritual world are comprehended in one idea. Thus the ancient
philosophers spoke of numbers, themselves being the best judges of their
own meaning.

[Exodus 29:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">exo 29:33</span></span>

But a stranger shall not eat thereof - That is, no person who was not of
the family of Aaron - no Israelite, and not even a Levite.

[Exodus 29:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">exo 29:34</span></span>

Burn the remainder with fire - Common, voluntary, and peace-offerings,
might be eaten even on the second day; see [Lev
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#016); [Lev
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#005), [Lev
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#006). But this being a peculiar
consecration, in order to qualify a person to offer sacrifices for sin,
like that great sacrifice, the paschal lamb, that typified the atonement
made by Christ, none of it was to be left till the morning lest
putrefaction should commence, which would be utterly improper in a
sacrifice that was to make expiation for sin, and bring the soul into a
state of holiness and perfection with God. See Clarke's note on [Exo
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#010).

[Exodus 29:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">exo 29:36</span></span>

Thou shalt cleanse the altar - The altar was to be sanctified for seven
days; and it is likely that on each day, previously to the consecration
service, the altar was wiped clean, and the former day's ashes, etc.,
removed.

[Exodus 29:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">exo 29:37</span></span>

Whatsoever touches the altar shall be holy - To this our Lord refers
[Mat 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#019), where he says the altar
sanctifies the gift; and this may be understood as implying that
whatever was laid on the altar became the Lord's property, and must be
wholly devoted to sacred uses, for in no other sense could such things
be sanctified by touching the altar.

[Exodus 29:39](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">exo 29:39</span></span>

One lamb thou shalt offer in the morning - These two lambs, one in the
morning, and the other in the evening, were generally termed the morning
and evening daily sacrifices, and were offered from the time of their
settlement in the promised land to the destruction of Jerusalem by the
Romans. The use of these sacrifices according to the Jews was this: "The
morning sacrifice made atonement for the sins committed in the night,
and the evening sacrifice expiated the sins committed during the day."

[Exodus 29:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">exo 29:40</span></span>

A tenth deal of flour - Deal signifies a part, from the Anglo-Saxon
word, to divide; hence, a part, a portion taken from the whole. From
[Num 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#005) we learn that this tenth
deal was the tenth part of an ephah, which constituted what is called an
omer. See [Exo 16:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#036); and see Clarke's
note on [Exo 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#016) of the same
chapter, where an account is given of different measures of capacity
among the Hebrews. The omer contained about three quarts English.

The fourth part of a hin - The hin contained one gallon and two pints.
The fourth part of this was about one quart and a half of a pint.

Drink-offering - A libation poured out before the Lord. See its meaning,
[Lev 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#001), etc.

[Exodus 29:43](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">exo 29:43</span></span>

There I will meet with the children of Israel - See Clarke's note on
[Exo 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022).

[Exodus 29:44](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">exo 29:44</span></span>

I will sanctify - both Aaron and his sons - So we find the
sanctification by Moses according to the Divine institution was only
symbolical; and that Aaron and his sons must be sanctified, i.e., made
holy, by God himself before they could officiate in holy things. From
this, as well as from many other things mentioned in the sacred
writings, we may safely infer that no designation by man only is
sufficient to qualify any person to fill the office of a minister of the
sanctuary. The approbation and consecration of man have both their
propriety and use, but must never be made substitutes for the unction
and inspiration of the Almighty. Let holy men ordain, but let God
sanctify; then we may expect that his Church shall be built up on its
most holy faith.

[Exodus 29:45](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">exo 29:45</span></span>

I will dwell among the children of Israel - This is the great charter of
the people of God, both under the Old and New Testaments; see [Exo
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#008); [Lev
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#011), [Lev
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#012); [Co2
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#016); [Rev
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#003). God dwells Among them: he is
ever to be found in his Church to enlighten, quicken, comfort, and
support it; to dispense the light of life by the preaching of his word,
and the influences of his Spirit for the conviction and conversion of
sinners. And he dwells In those who believe; and this is the very tenor
of the New Covenant which God promised to make with the house of Israel;
see [Jer 31:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031); [Eze
37:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#024); [Heb
8:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#007); and [Co2
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#016). And because God had promised to
dwell in all his genuine followers, hence the frequent reference to this
covenant and its privileges in the New Testament. And hence it is so
frequently and strongly asserted that every believer is a habitation of
God through the Spirit, [Eph 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#022).
That the Spirit of God witnesses with their spirits that they are the
children of God, [Rom 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#016). That the
Spirit of Christ in their hearts enables them to call God their Father,
[Gal 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006). And that if any man have not
this Spirit, he is none of his, [Rom
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#009), etc. And hence St. Paul states
this to be the sum and substance of apostolical preaching, and the
riches of the glory of the mystery of the Gospel among the Gentiles,
viz., Christ In you the hope of glory; whom, says he, we preach, warning
every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present
every man perfect In Christ Jesus; [Col
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#027), [Col
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#028).

[Exodus 29:46](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">exo 29:46</span></span>

And they shall know that I am the Lord their God - That is, They shall
acknowledge God, and their infinite obligations to him. In a multitude
of places in Scripture the word know should be thus understood.

That I may dwell among them - For without this acknowledgment and
consequent dependence on and gratitude and obedience to God, they could
not expect him to dwell among them.

By dwelling among the people God shows that he would be a continual
resident in their houses and in their hearts; that he would be their God
- the sole object of their religious worship, to whom they should turn
and on whom they should trust in all difficulties and distresses; and
that he would be to them all that the Creator could be to his creatures.
That in consequence they should have a full conviction of his presence
and blessing, and a consciousness that He was their God, and that they
were his people. Thus then God dwells among men that they may know him;
and they must know him that he may continue to dwell among them. He who
does not experimentally know God, cannot have him as an indwelling
Savior; and he who does not continue to know - to acknowledge, love, and
obey him, cannot retain him as his Preserver and Sanctifier. From the
beginning of the world, the salvation of the souls of men necessarily
implied the indwelling influences of God. Reader, hast thou this
salvation? This alone will support thee in all thy travels in this
wilderness, comfort thee in death, and give thee boldness in the day of
judgment. "He," says an old writer, "who has pardon may look his judge
in the face."
