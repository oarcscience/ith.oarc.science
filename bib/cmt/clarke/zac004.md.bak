### [Zechariah Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#001.md)

[Zechariah](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">zac 4:0</span></span>

The prophet, overpowered by his last vision, is roused by the angel to
behold another, [Zac 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#001.md); intended
also to assure the Jews of the success of Joshua and Zerubbabel in
building the temple, and surmounting every obstacle in the way; till at
length, by the good providence of God, it should be finished, amidst the
joyful acclamations of the spectators, [Zac
4:2-10](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#002.md). The angel's explanation of the
golden candlestick, and of the two olive trees, [Zac
4:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#011.md).

[Zechariah 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 4:7</span></span>

O great mountain? - The hinderances which were thrown in the way; the
regal prohibition to discontinue the building of the temple.

Before Zerubbabel - a plain - The sovereign power of God shall remove
them. March on, Zerubbabel; all shall be made plain and smooth before
thee. I have given thee the work to do, and I will remove all
hinderances out of thy way.

He shall bring forth the headstone - As he has laid the foundation
stone, so shall he put on the headstone: as he has begun the building,
so shall he finish it!

With shoutings - The universal acclamation of the people.

Grace, grace unto it - How beautiful is this structure! May the favor of
God ever rest upon it, and be manifested in it!

[Zechariah 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zac 4:10</span></span>

Who hath despised the day of small things? - The poverty, weakness, and
unbefriended state of the Jews. It was said, "What do these feeble
Jews?" "Will they build," etc.? No. But God will build by them, and
perfect his building too.

And shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel - He is master
builder under God, the grand architect.

Those seven - are the eyes of the Lord - Either referring to his
particular and especial providence; or to those ministering spirits,
whom he has employed in behalf of the Jews, to dispense the blessings of
that providence. See [Ch2 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#009) (note.md);
[Pro 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#003) (note.md); [Zac
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#009) (note.md).

[Zechariah 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zac 4:11</span></span>

What are these two olive trees - See on [Zac
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#002) (note.md).

[Zechariah 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">zac 4:12</span></span>

What be these two olive branches - That is, two boughs laden with
branches of olive berries.

[Zechariah 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">zac 4:14</span></span>

These are the two anointed ones - Joshua, the high priest; and
Zerubbabel the governor. These are anointed - appointed by the Lord; and
stand by him, the one to minister in the ecclesiastical, the other in
the civil state.

Probably we may not be able to comprehend the whole of this
hieroglyphical vision; for even the interpreting angel does not choose
to answer the questions relative to this, which were put to him by the
prophet. See [Zac 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#004.md), [Zac
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#011.md). But though the particulars are
hard to be understood; yet the general meaning has, I hope, been given.

[Zechariah 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 4:1</span></span>

The angel - came again, and waked me - Abp. Newcome considers this
vision as represented on the same night, [Zac
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#008.md), with the preceding ones. See the
latter part of [Zac 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#010.md), compared
with [Zac 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#009.md). After some interval the
prophet, overpowered with the vision which had been presented to him,
was awakened from his prophetic trance as from a sleep.

[Zechariah 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 4:2</span></span>

A candlestick all of gold - This candlestick is formed in some measure
after that of the sanctuary, [Exo
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#031.md), [Exo
25:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#032.md) : but in that of the sanctuary
there was no bowl, nor seven pipes, nor seven lamps, nor the two olive
trees. The two olive trees were to supply the bowl with oil; the bowl
was to communicate the oil to the seven pipes; and the seven pipes were
to supply the seven lamps. In general, the candlestick, its bowl, pipes,
lamps, and olive trees, are emblems of the pure service of God, and the
grace and salvation to be enjoyed by his true worshippers. The
candlestick may, however, represent the whole Jewish state,
ecclesiastical and civil; the oil, producing the light, the grace and
mercy of God; and the two olive trees, the source of infinite love,
whence that grace proceeds. The pipes may signify all means of grace;
and the seven lamps, the perfection and abundance of the light and
salvation provided. Some may take them in the following way: -

1\. The olive trees, the Divine goodness, yield the oil from the olive
berry, which is its fruit.

2\. From each comes a pipe to convey the oil to the bowl.

3\. This oil is collected in the bowl, which is supposed to represent
Jesus, the great Mediator, through whom alone all grace and mercy
descend to man.

4\. The seven pipes, the various means of grace - reading, hearing,
prayer, sacraments, etc. - through which Christ dispenses his grace and
blessing to his followers.

5\. The seven lamps - the Spirit of God in its plentitude of graces,
gifts, and light, dispensed to the Christian Church.

[Zechariah 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 4:6</span></span>

This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel - This prince was in a
trying situation, and he needed especial encouragement from God; and
here it is: Not by might, (of thy own), nor by power, (authority from
others), but by my Spirit - the providence, authority, power, and energy
of the Most High. In this way shall my temple be built; in this way
shall my Church be raised and preserved. No secular arm, no human
prudence, no earthly policy, no suits at law, shall ever be used for the
founding, extension, and preservation of my Church. But the spirit of
the world says, "These are all means to which as we must have recourse;
otherwise the cause of God may be ruined." Satan, thou liest!
