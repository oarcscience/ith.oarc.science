### [Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#001.md)

The bride's love to her spouse, [Sol
1:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#001.md). She conffieuses her
unworthiness; desires to be directed to the flock, [Sol
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#006.md), [Sol
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#007.md); and she is directed to the
shepherds' tents, [Sol 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#008.md). The
bridegroom describes his bride, and shows how he will provide for her,
and how comfortably they are accommodated, [Sol
1:9-17](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#009.md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sol 1:1</span></span>

The song of songs - A song of peculiar excellence. See the Introduction.
The rabbins consider this superior to all songs. Ten songs, says the
Tarpon, have been sung; but this excels them all.

1\. The first was sung by Adam when his sin was pardoned.

2\. The second was sung by Moses and the Israelites at the Red Sea.

3\. The third was sung by the Israelites when they drank of the rock in
the wilderness.

4\. The fourth was sung by Moses when summoned to depart from this
world.

5\. The fifth was sung by Joshua when the sun and moon stood still.

6\. The sixth was sung by Deborah and Barak after the defeat of Sisera.

7\. The seventh was sung by Hannah when the Lord promised her a son.

8\. The eighth was sung by David for all the mercies given him by God.

9\. The ninth is the present, sung in the spirit of prophecy by Solomon.

10\. The tenth is that which shall be sung by the children of Israel
when restored from their captivities. See the Targum.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sol 1:2</span></span>

Let him kiss me, etc. - She speaks of the bridegroom in the third
person, to testify her own modesty, and to show him the greater respect.

Thy love is better than wine - The versions in general translate דדיך
dodeyca, thy breasts; and they are said to represent, spiritually, the
Old and New Testaments.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sol 1:3</span></span>

Thy name is as ointment poured forth - Ointments and perfumes were, and
still are, in great request among the Asiatics. They occur constantly in
their entertainments. Thy name is as refreshing to my heart, as the best
perfumes diffused through a chamber are to the senses of the guests.

Therefore do the virgins love thee - She means herself; but uses this
periphrasis through modesty.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sol 1:4</span></span>

Draw me - Let me have the full assurance of thy affection.

We will run after thee - Speaking in the plural through modesty, while
still herself is meant.

The king hath brought me - My spouse is a potentate, a mighty king, no
ordinary person.

Into his chambers - He has favored me with his utmost confidence.

The upright love thee - The most perfect and accomplished find thee
worthy of their highest esteem.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sol 1:5</span></span>

I am black, but comely - This is literally true of many of the Asiatic
women; though black or brown, they are exquisitely beautiful. Many of
the Egyptian women are still fine; but their complexion is much inferior
to that of the Palestine females. Though black or swarthy in my
complexion, yet am I comely - well proportioned in every part.

As the tents of Kedar - I am tawny, like the tents of the Arabians, and
like the pavilions of Solomon, probably covered by a kind of tanned
cloth. The daughters of Jerusalem are said to represent the synagogue;
the bride, the Church of Christ. It is easy to find spiritual meanings:
every creed will furnish them.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sol 1:6</span></span>

Because the sun hath looked upon me - The bride gives here certain
reasons why she was dark complexioned. "The sun hath looked upon me." I
am sunburnt, tanned by the sun; being obliged, perhaps, through some
domestic jealously or uneasiness, to keep much without: "My mother's
children were angry; they made me keeper of the vineyards." Here the
brown complexion of the Egyptians is attributed to the influence of the
sun or climate.

My mother's children were angry with me - Acted severely. The bringing
of a foreigner to the throne would no doubt excite jealousy among the
Jewish females; who, from their own superior complexion, national and
religious advantages, might well suppose that Solomon should not have
gone to Egypt for a wife and queen, while Judea could have furnished him
with every kind of superior excellence.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sol 1:7</span></span>

Tell me - where thou feedest - This is spoken as if the parties were
shepherds, or employed in the pastoral life. But how this would apply
either to Solomon, or the princes of Egypt, is not easy to ascertain.
Probably in the marriage festival there was something like our masks, in
which persons of quality assumed rural characters and their employments.
See that fine one composed by Milton, called Comus.

To rest at noon - In hot countries the shepherds and their flocks are
obliged to retire to shelter during the burning heats of the noon-day
sun. This is common in all countries, in the summer heats, where shelter
can be had.

One that turneth aside - As a wanderer; one who, not knowing where to
find her companions, wanders fruitlessly in seeking them. It was
customary for shepherds to drive their flocks together for the purpose
of conversing, playing on the pipe, or having trials of skill in poetry
or music. So Virgil: -

Forte sub arguta consederat ilice Daphnis

Compulerantque greges Corydon et Thyrsis in unum:

Thyrsis oves, Corydon distentas lacte capellas;

Ambo florentes aetatibus, Arcades ambo,

Et cantare pares, et respondere parati.

[Ecc 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#001.md).

"Beneath a holm repair'd two jolly swains:

Their sheep and goats together grazed the plains;

Both young Arcadians, both alike inspired

To sing and answer as the song required."

Dryden.

This does not express the sense of the original: from the different
pastures in which they had been accustomed to feed their flocks, they
drove their sheep and goats together for the purpose mentioned in the
pastoral; and, in course, returned to their respective pasturages, when
their business was over.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sol 1:8</span></span>

If thou know not - This appears to be the reply of the virgins.

They know not exactly; and therefore direct the bride to the shepherds,
who would give information.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sol 1:9</span></span>

I have compared thee - to a company of horses - This may be translated,
more literally, "I have compared thee, to my mare, in the chariots or
courses of Pharaoh;" and so the versions understood it. Mares, in
preference to horses, were used both for riding and for chariots in the
East. They are much swifter, endure more hardship. and will go longer
without food, than either the stallion or the gelding.

There is perhaps no brute creature in the world so beautiful as a fine
well-bred horse or mare; and the finest woman in the universe, Helen,
has been compared to a horse in a Thessalian chariot, by Theocritus.
Idyl. 18: ver. 28: -

Ὡδε και ἁ χρυσεα Ἑλενα διαφαινετ' εν ἡμιν,

Πιειρη, μεγαλη, ἁτ' ανεδραμεν ογμος αρουρᾳ,

Η καπῳ κυπαρισσος, η ἁρματι Θεσσαλος ἱππος.

"The golden Helen, tall and graceful, appears as distinguished among us
as the furrow in the field, the cypress in the garden, or the Thessalian
horse in the chariot."

This passage amply justifies the Hebrew bard, in the simile before us.
See [Jer 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#002.md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sol 1:10</span></span>

Thy cheeks are comely - D'Arvieux has remarked that "the Arabian ladies
wear a great many pearls about their necks and caps. They have golds
chains about their necks which hang down upon their bosoms with strings
of coloured gauze; the gauze itself bordered with zechins and other
pieces of gold coin, which hang upon their foreheods and both cheeks.
The ordinary women wear small silver coins, with which they cover their
forehead-piece like fish scales, as this is one of the principal
ornaments of their faces." I have seen their essence bottles ornamented
with festoons of aspers, and small pieces of silver pearls, beads, etc.
One of these is now before me.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sol 1:11</span></span>

Borders of gold - I have observed several of the handkerchiefs, shawls,
and head attire of the Eastern women, curiously and expensively worked
in the borders with gold and silver, and variously coloured silk, which
has a splendid effect.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sol 1:12</span></span>

While the king sitteth at his table - במסבו bimsibbo, in his circle,
probably meaning the circle of his friends at the marriage festivals, or
a round table.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sol 1:13</span></span>

He shall lie all night betwixt my breasts - Mr. Harmer contends that it
is the bundle of myrrh which the bride says shall lie all night betwixt
her breasts, to which she compares the bridegroom, his name being as
pleasing and refreshing to her mind, as the myrrh or stacte was to her
senses, by its continual fragrance.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sol 1:14</span></span>

A cluster of camphire - Mr. Hasselquist supposes this to mean a bunch of
the Cyprus grape; but this is supposed to mean a shrub so called, not
any production of the isle of Cypress; the best kinds of which were
found at En-gedi. This place belonged to the tribe of Judah.

Perhaps the poet alludes to the dark color of the hair, which by the
Greeks was not unfrequently compared to the bunches of grapes; by no
means an unfit similitude for thick black clustering curls. The
following lines represent the same idea: -

"The dark black locks that ornament her neck

Hang thick and clustering like the branchy palm."

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sol 1:15</span></span>

Thou hast doves' eyes - The large and beautiful dove of Syria is
supposed to be here referred to, the eyes of which are remarkably fine.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sol 1:16</span></span>

Also our bed is green - ערס eres, from its use in several places of the
Hebrew Bible, generally signifies a mattress; and here probably a green
bank is meant, on which they sat down, being now on a walk in the
country. Or it may mean a bower in a garden, or the nuptial bed.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sol 1:17</span></span>

The beams of our house are cedar - Perhaps it was under a cedar tree
whose vast limbs were interwoven with the ברות beroth, a tree of the
cypress kind, where they now sat. And this natural bower recommended
itself to the poet's attention by its strength, loftiness, and its
affording them a shady cover and cool retreat. How natural to break out
into the praise of a bower, by whose branches and foliage we are
shielded from the intense heat of the sun! Even the shelter of a great
rock to a weary land is celebrated by the pen of the first of prophets
and greatest of poets, [Isa 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#002.md).

With this chapter the first day of the marriage ceremonies is supposed
to end.
