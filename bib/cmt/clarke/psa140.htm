<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001">Psalms</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_000">psa 140:0</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The psalmist prays against his enemies, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#001">Psa 140:1-6</A>; returns thanks for help, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#007">Psa 140:7</A>; describes his enemies, and prays farther against them, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#008">Psa 140:8-11</A>. His confidence in God, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#012">Psa 140:12</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#013">Psa 140:13</A>.
<p>The Hebrew, and all the Versions, attribute this Psalm to David; and it is supposed to contain his complaint when persecuted by Saul. The Syriac determines it to the time when Saul endeavored to transfix David with his spear. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#001">Psalms 140:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 140:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>From the evil man - Saul, who was full of envy, jealousy, and cruelty against David, to whom both himself and his kingdom were under the highest obligations, endeavored by every means to destroy him. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#002">Psalms 140:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 140:2</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>They gathered together - He and his courtiers form plots and cabals against my life. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#003">Psalms 140:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 140:3</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>They have sharpened their tongues - They employ their time in forging lies and calumnies against me; and those of the most virulent nature. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#004">Psalms 140:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 140:4</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Preserve me from the violent man - Saul again; who was as headstrong and violent in all his measures, as he was cruel, and inflexibly bent on the destruction of David. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#005">Psalms 140:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 140:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Have hid a snare for me - They hunted David as they would a dangerous wild beast: one while striving to pierce him with the spear; another to entangle him in their snares, so as to take and sacrifice him before the people, on pretense of his being an enemy to the state.
<p>Selah - This is the truth. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#007">Psalms 140:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">psa 140:7</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Thou hast covered my head - Not only when I fought with the proud blaspheming Philistine; but in the various attempts made against my life by my sworn enemies. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#008">Psalms 140:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 140:8</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Further not his wicked device - He knew his enemies still desired his death, and were plotting to accomplish it; and here he prays that God may disappoint and confound them. The Chaldee understands this of Doeg. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#010">Psalms 140:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 140:10</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Let burning coals - The Chaldee considers this as spoken against Ahithophel, who was head of a conspiracy against David; and translates this verse thus: "Let coals from heaven fall upon them, precipitate them into the fire of hell, and into miry pits, from which they shall not have a resurrection to eternal life." This is a proof that the Jews did believe in a resurrection of the body, and an eternal life for that body, in the case of the righteous. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#011">Psalms 140:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">psa 140:11</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Let not an evil speaker be established - &#1488;&#1497;&#1513; &#1500;&#1513;&#1493;&#1503;  ish lashon, "a man of tongue." There is much force in the rendering of this clause in the Chaldee &#1490;&#1489;&#1512; &#1491;&#1502;&#1513;&#1514;&#1506;&#1497; &#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1503; &#1514;&#1500;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;  gebar demishtai lishan telithai, "The man of detraction, or inflammation, with the three-forked tongue." He whose tongue is set on fire from hell; the tale-bearer, slanderer, and dealer in scandal: with the three-forked tongue; wounding three at once: his neiphbour whom he slanders; the person who receives the slander; and himself who deals in it. What a just description of a character which God, angels, and good men must detest! Let not such a one be established in the land; let him be unmasked; let no person trust him; and let all join together to hoot him out of society. "He shall be hunted by the angel of death, and thrust into hell." - Chaldee. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#012">Psalms 140:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">psa 140:12</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The cause of the afflicted - Every person who is persecuted for righteousness' sake has God for his peculiar help and refuge; and the persecutor has the same God for his especial enemy. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#013">Psalms 140:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">psa 140:13</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The righteous shall give thanks - For thou wilt support and deliver him.
<p>The upright shall dwell in thy presence - Shall be admitted to the most intimate intercourse with God.
<p>The persecuted have ever been dear to God Almighty; and the martyrs were, in an especial manner, his delight; and in proportion as he loved those, so must he hate and detest these.
