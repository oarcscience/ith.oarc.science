### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 7:0</span></span>

The men of Kirjah-jearim bring the ark from Beth-shemesh, and consecrate
Eleazar, the son of Abinadab, to keep it; and there it continued twenty
years, [Sa1 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#001.md), [Sa1
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#002.md). Samuel reproves and exhorts the
people, and gathers them together at Mizpeh, where they fast and pray,
and confess their sins, [Sa1 7:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#003.md).
The Philistines go up against them; the Israelites cry unto the Lord for
help; Samuel offers sacrifices; and the Lord confounds the Philistines
with thunder; Israel discomfits and pursues them to Beth-car, [Sa1
7:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#007.md). Samuel erects a stone for a
memorial, and calls it Eben-ezer, [Sa1
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#012.md). The Philistines are totally
subdued, and Israel recovers all its lost cities, [Sa1
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#013.md), [Sa1
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#014.md). Samuel acts as an itinerant
judge in Israel, [Sa1 7:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#015.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 7:1</span></span>

Fetched up the ark - When these people received the message of the
Beth-shemites, they probably consulted Samuel, with whom was the counsel
of the Lord, and he had encouraged them to go and bring it up, else they
might have expected such destruction as happened to the Beth-shemites.

Sanctified Eleazar - Perhaps this sanctifying signifies no more than
setting this man apart, simply to take care of the ark.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 7:2</span></span>

It was twenty years - This chapter contains the transactions of at least
twenty years, but we know not the date of each event.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 7:3</span></span>

And Samuel spake - We have heard nothing of this judge since he served
in the tabernacle. He was now grown up, and established for a prophet in
the land of Israel.

If ye do return - From your backsliding and idolatry.

With all your hearts - For outward services and professions will avail
nothing.

Put away the strange gods - Destroy their images, altars, and groves:
they are strange; you do not know them as helpers, saviours, or
defenders.

Prepare your hearts - Let your hearts be straight and steady.

And serve him only - Have no other religious service but his, and obey
his laws.

He will deliver you - Vain are your own exertions; he will deliver you
in such a way as to show that the excellence of the power is of himself
alone.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 7:4</span></span>

Put away Baalim and Ashtaroth - These were not two particular deities,
but two genera of idols; the one masculine, Baalim; the other feminine,
Ashtaroth; both the words are in the plural number, and signify all
their gods and goddesses.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 7:5</span></span>

Gather all Israel to Mizpeh - This appears to have been an armed
assembly, though probably collected principally for religious and
political purposes; but Samuel knew that an unarmed multitude could not
safely be convened in the vicinity of the Philistines.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 7:6</span></span>

Drew water, and poured it out - It is not easy to know what is meant by
this; it is true that pouring out water, in the way of libation, was a
religious ordinance among the Hebrews, ([Isa
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#003).md), and among most other nations,
particularly the Greeks and Romans, who used, not only water, but wine,
milk, honey, and blood, as we find by Homer, Virgil, Euripides,
Sophocles, Porphyry, and Lucian. Our Lord seems to allude to this
ceremony, [Joh 7:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037) (note.md), where
see the note.

The Chaldee Paraphrast understands the place differently, for he
translates: "And they poured out their hearts in penitence, as Waters,
before the Lord." That deep penitential sorrow was represented under the
notion of pouring out water, we have a direct proof in the case of
David, who says, [Psa 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#014.md), I am
Poured Out like Water, my heart is like wax; it is Melted in the midst
of my bowels. And to repentance, under this very similitude, the prophet
exhorts fallen Jerusalem: Arise, cry out in the night; in the beginning
of the watches Pour Out thine Heart Like Water before the face of the
Lord; [Lam 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#019.md). David uses the same
image, [Psa 62:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#008.md) : Trust in him at all
times, ye people; Pour Out your hearts before him. The same figure is
used by Hannah in [Sa1 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#015.md) of this
book; I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit; I have Poured Out my soul
before the Lord. Perhaps the drawing and pouring out of water mentioned
in the text was done emblematically, to represent the contrition of
their hearts.

And Samuel judged - He gave them ordinances, heard and redressed
grievances, and taught them how to get reconciled to God. The assembly,
therefore, was held for religio-politico-military purposes.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 7:7</span></span>

The Philistines went up against Israel - They went to give them battle
before that, by continual accessions of numbers, they should become too
powerful.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 7:8</span></span>

Cease not to cry unto the Lord - They had strong confidence in the
intercession of Samuel, because they knew he was a holy man of God.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 7:9</span></span>

Samuel took a sucking lamb - This sucking lamb must have been eight days
under its mother before it could be offered, as the law says, [Lev
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#027.md).

Though Samuel was not a priest, yet he offered this sacrifice; or he
might have ordered Eleazar to offer it, and still be said to have done
it himself: Qui facit per alterum, facit per se; "He who procures a
thing to be done, may be said to do it himself." His not sacrificing at
the tabernacle was justified by the necessity of the case; neither
tabernacle nor ark was at hand.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 7:10</span></span>

The Lord thundered with a great thunder - Literally, The Lord thundered
with a great voice - he confounded them with a mighty tempest of thunder
and lightning, and no doubt slew many by the lightning.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 7:11</span></span>

Under Beth-car - We know not where this place was; the Septuagint have
Beth-chor; the Targum, Beth-saron; and the Syriac and Arabic,
Beth-jasan.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 7:12</span></span>

Called the name of it Eben-ezer - אבן העזר Eben haezer, "The Stone of
Help;" perhaps a pillar is meant by the word stone.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 7:13</span></span>

They came no more into the coast of Israel - Perhaps a more signal
victory was never gained by Israel; the Lord had brought them low,
almost to extermination; and now, by his miraculous interference, he
lifts them completely up, and humbles to the dust their proud
oppressors. God often suffers nations and individuals to be brought to
the lowest extremity, that he may show his mercy and goodness by
suddenly rescuing them from destruction, when all human help has most
evidently failed.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 7:14</span></span>

The cities which the Philistines had taken - We are not informed of the
particulars of these reprisals, but we may rest assured all this was not
done in one day: perhaps the retaking of the cities was by slow degrees,
through the space of several years.

There was peace between Israel and the Amorites - That is, all the
remaining Canaanites kept quiet, and did not attempt to molest the
Israelites, when they found the Philistines, the most powerful of the
ancient inhabitants of the land, broken and subdued before them.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 7:15</span></span>

Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life - Samuel is supposed to
have lived one hundred years; he did not begin to judge Israel till he
was about forty years of age; and if he was one hundred years of age
when he died, he must have been a judge sixty years, and consequently
filled that office during the whole of Saul's reign. But that he had
been dead before Saul's last battle, is evident from the transactions of
that king with the witch of En-dor, and probably not long before. Samuel
was the prophet of that time; declared the will of the Lord, and
frequently directed both the civil and military transactions of the
kingdom. Samuel seems, in many respects, to have been considered the
governor of the people, while Saul was only looked on as the general of
the armies.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa1 7:16</span></span>

He went from year to year in circuit - When he was at Beth-el, the tribe
of Ephraim, and all the northern parts of the country, could attend him;
when at Gilgal, the tribe of Benjamin, and those beyond Jordan, might
have easy access to him; and when at Mizpeh, he was within reach of
Judah, Simeon, and Gad; but Ramah was the place of his ordinary abode;
and there he held his court, for there he judged Israel; and, as it is
probable that Shiloh was destroyed, it is said, [Sa1
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#017), that there (viz., at Ramah.md) he
built an altar unto the Lord. This altar, being duly consecrated, the
worship performed at it was strictly legal. Ramah, which is said to be
about six miles from Jerusalem, was the seat of prophecy during the life
of Samuel; and there it is probable all Israel came to consult him on
matters of a spiritual nature, as there was the only altar of God in the
land of Israel.
