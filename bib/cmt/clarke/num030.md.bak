### [Numbers Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 30:0</span></span>

The law concerning vows of men, [Num
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#001.md), [Num
30:2](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#002.md). Of women under age, and in what
cases the father may annul them, [Num
30:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#003.md). The vows of a wife, and in
what cases the husband may annul them, [Num
30:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#006.md). The vows of a widow, or
divorced woman, in what cases they may be considered either as confirmed
or annulled, [Num 30:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#009.md).
Recapitulation of these ordinances, [Num
30:16](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#016.md).

[Numbers 30:2](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 30:2</span></span>

If a man vow a vow - A vow is a religious promise made to God. Vows were
of several kinds: -

1\. Of abstinence or humiliation, see [Num
30:13](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#013.md);

2\. Of the Nazarite, see Numbers 6;

3\. Of giving certain things or sacrifices to the Lord, [Lev
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#016.md);

4\. Of alms given to the poor, see [Deu
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#021.md).

The law in this chapter must have been very useful, as it both prevented
and annulled rash vows, and provided a proper sanction for the support
and performance of those that were rationally and piously made. Besides,
this law must have acted as a great preventive of lying and hypocrisy.
If a vow was properly made, a man or woman was bound, under penalty of
the displeasure of God, to fulfill it.

[Numbers 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 30:3</span></span>

In her youth - That is, say the rabbins, under twelve years of age; and
under thirteen in case of a young man. Young persons of this age were
considered to be under the authority of their parents, and had
consequently no power to vow away the property of another. A married
woman was in the same circumstances, because she was under the authority
of her husband. If however the parents or the husband heard of the vow,
and objected to it in the same day in which they heard of it, ([Num
30:5](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#005).md), then the vow was annulled; or,
if having heard of it, they held their peace, this was considered a
ratification of the vow.

A rash vow was never to be kept; "for," says Philo, and common sense and
justice say the same, "he who commits an unjust action because of his
vow adds one crime to another,

1\. By making an unlawful vow;

2\. By doing an unlawful action."

[Numbers 30:12](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 30:12</span></span>

Concerning the bond of her soul - Her life is at stake if she fulfill
not the obligation under which she has laid herself.

[Numbers 30:16](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 30:16</span></span>

These are the statutes - It is very probable that this law, like that
concerning the succession of daughters, (Numbers 27)., rose from the
exigency of some particular case that had just then occurred.

Making vows, in almost any case, is a dangerous business; they seldom do
any good, and often much evil. He who does not feel himself bound to do
what is fit, right, and just, from the standing testimony of God's word,
is not likely to do it from any obligation he may lay upon his own
conscience. If God's word lack weight with him, his own will prove
lighter than vanity. Every man who professes the Christian religion is
under the most solemn obligation to devote body, soul, and spirit to
God, not only to the utmost extent of his powers, but also as long as he
exists. Being baptized, and receiving the sacrament of the Lord's
Supper, are additional ratifications of the great, general, Christian
vow; but every true follower of Christ should always remember, and
frequently renew, his covenant with God.
