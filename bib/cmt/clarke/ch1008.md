### [1 Chronicles Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 8:0</span></span>

The genealogy of Benjamin down to Saul, vv. 1-32. The children and
descendants of Saul, [Ch1 8:33-40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#033.md).

[1 Chronicles 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 8:1</span></span>

Now Benjamin begat, etc. - See what has been said on the preceding
chapter, [Ch1 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#006) (note.md).

[1 Chronicles 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch1 8:9</span></span>

He begat of Hodesh his wife - In the preceding verse it is said that
Hushim and Baara were his wives; and here it is said he begat of Hodesh
his wife, etc. And then his children by Hushim are mentioned, but not a
word of Baara! It is likely therefore that Hodesh was another name for
Baara, and this is asserted by the Targum: And he begot of Baara, that
is Chodesh, his wife; so called because he espoused her anew. It is
supposed that he had put her away before, and now remarried her.

[1 Chronicles 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch1 8:12</span></span>

Who built Ono, and Lod - The Targum adds, "Which the children of Israel
ravaged and burnt with fire, when they made war on the tribe of Benjamin
in Gibeah."

[1 Chronicles 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">ch1 8:28</span></span>

These were heads of the fathers - On the following verses Dr. Kennicott
has labored hard to restore the true reading. See his detailed
comparison of these and their parallel passages in his Hebrew Bible,
vol. ii., p. 667.

[1 Chronicles 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">ch1 8:29</span></span>

And at Gibeon - This passage to the end of the 38th verse is found with
a little variety in the names, [Ch1
9:35-44](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#035.md).

The rabbins say that Ezra, having found two books that had these
passages with a variety in the names, as they agreed in general, he
thought best to insert them both, not being able to discern which was
the best.

His general plan was to collate all the copies he had, and to follow the
greater number when he found them to agree; those which disagreed from
the majority were thrown aside as spurious; and yet, in many cases,
probably the rejected copies contained the true text.

If Ezra proceeded as R. Sol. Jarchi says, he had a very imperfect notion
of the rules of true criticism; and it is no wonder that he has left so
many faults in his text.

[1 Chronicles 8:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">ch1 8:34</span></span>

Merib-baal - The same as Mephibosheth, for, as the Israelites detested
Baal, which signifies lord, they changed it into bosheth, which
signifies shame or reproach.

[1 Chronicles 8:40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">ch1 8:40</span></span>

The sons of Ulam were mighty men of valor - The Targum speaks honourably
of them: "The sons of Ulam were mighty and strong men, subduing by
wisdom their evil concupiscence, as men bend a bow; therefore they had
many sons and grandsons." Of the six sons of Azel, mentioned [Ch1
8:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#038.md), R. S. Jarchi says that their
allegorical expositions were sufficient to load thirteen thousand
camels! No doubt these were reputed to be deeply learned men. There was
a time when the allegorizers and metaphor-men ranked very high among
theologians, even in our own enlightened and critical country. At
present they are almost totally out of fashion. May they never recover
their footing! But what a shameful hyperbole is that of Jarchi! The
writings of six men a load for thirteen thousand camels!
