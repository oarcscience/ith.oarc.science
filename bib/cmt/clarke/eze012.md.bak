### [Ezekiel Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 12:0</span></span>

The prophet proceeds, by a variety of types and parables, to convince
those of the captivity that their brethren who were left behind to
sustain the miseries of a siege and the insults of a conqueror, would be
in a much worse condition than they who were already settled in a
foreign land. In the beginning of this chapter he foretells the
approaching captivity of Judah by action instead of words, [Eze
12:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#001.md). He predicts particularly the
flight, capture, captivity, and sufferings of Zedekiah and his
followers, [Eze 12:8-16](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#008.md), compared with
[Jer 52:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#011.md). He is to eat his food with
trembling and signs of terror, as an emblem of the consternation of the
Jews when surrounded by their enemies, [Eze
12:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#017.md); and then he answers the
objections and bywords of scoffers and infidels, who either disbelieved
his threatening or supposed the accomplishment of them very distant,
[Eze 12:21-28](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#021). Josephus (Antiq. 11:10.md)
tells us that Zedekiah thought the prophecy of Ezekiel in the thirteenth
verse inconsistent with that of Jeremiah, ([Jer
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#003).md), and resolved to believe
neither. Both, however, were literary fulfilled; and the event convinced
him that they were not irreconcilable. Thus, blinded by infidelity,
sinners rush on to that destruction against which they are sufficiently
warned.

[Ezekiel 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 12:2</span></span>

Which have eyes to see, and see not - It is not want of grace that
brings them to destruction. They have eyes to see, but they will not use
them. No man is lost because he had not sufficient grace to save him,
but because he abused that grace.

[Ezekiel 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 12:3</span></span>

Prepare thee stuff for removing - Get carriages to transport thy goods
to another place; signifying by this the captivity that was at hand.

[Ezekiel 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 12:5</span></span>

Dig thou through the wall - This refers to the manner in which Zedekiah
and his family would escape from the city. They escaped by night through
a breach in the wall. See [Jer 39:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#002.md);
and [Kg2 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#004.md).

[Ezekiel 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 12:6</span></span>

Thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not the ground - Referring to
the blinding of Zedekiah: even the covering of the face might be
intended to signify that in this way Zedekiah should be carried to
Babylon on men's shoulders in some sort of palanquin, with a cloth tied
over his eyes, because of the recent wounds made by extracting them. All
the prophecies from this to the twentieth chapter are supposed to have
been delivered in the sixth year of Zedekiah, five years before the
taking of Jerusalem. How accurate the prediction! and how exactly
fulfilled!

[Ezekiel 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 12:10</span></span>

This burden - This prediction concerning the prince. By this I point out
the capture, misery, and ruin of Zedekiah.

[Ezekiel 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 12:13</span></span>

I will bring - him to Babylon - yet shall he not see it - Because
Nebuchadnezzar caused him to have his eyes put out at Riblah. To Babylon
he was carried in his blind state, and there he died. In saying, My net
also will I spread upon him, there is probably a reference to an ancient
manner of fighting. One, who was called the retiarius, had a small
casting net, which if he could throw over his antagonist's head, he then
dispatched him with his sword; if he missed his throw, he was obliged to
run in order to get his net once more adjusted for another throw. In the
mean time the other pursued him with all his speed to prevent this, and
to dispatch him; hence he was called secutor: the first the netman, the
second the pursuer.

[Ezekiel 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 12:18</span></span>

Eat thy bread with quaking - Assume the manner of a person who is every
moment afraid of his life, who has nothing but a morsel of bread to eat,
and a little water to drink. Thus signifying the siege, and the straits
to which they should be reduced. See this explained, [Eze
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#019) (note.md).

[Ezekiel 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 12:22</span></span>

The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth? - These are the words
of the infidels and scoffers, who, because vengeance was not speedily
executed on an evil work, set their heart to do iniquity. "These
predictions either will not come in our days, or will wholly fail; why
then should we disquiet ourselves about them?" Strange, that the very
means used by the most gracious God to bring sinners to repentance,
should be made by them the very instruments of their own destruction!
See [Pe2 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#004.md).

[Ezekiel 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 12:23</span></span>

The days are at hand - Far from failing or being prolonged, time is
posting on, and the destruction threatened is at the door.

[Ezekiel 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eze 12:26</span></span>

In your days - will I say the word, and will perform it - Even these
mockers shall live to see and feel this desolation. This is more
particularly intimated in the following verses.

[Ezekiel 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">eze 12:28</span></span>

There shall none of my words be prolonged any more - He had waited to be
gracious; they abused his mercy; and at last the protracted wrath rushed
upon them with irresistible force.
