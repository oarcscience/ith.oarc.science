### [Exodus Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#001)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 25:0</span></span>

The Lord addresses Moses out of the Divine glory, and commands him to
speak unto the Israelites, that they may give him free-will offerings,
[Exo 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#001), [Exo
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#002). The different kinds of

[Exodus 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 25:2</span></span>

That they bring me an offering - The offering here mentioned is the
תרומה terumah, a kind of free-will offering, consisting of any thing
that was necessary for the occasion. It signifies properly any thing
that was lifted up, the heave-offering, because in presenting it to God
it was lifted up to be laid on his altar; but see Clarke on [Exo
29:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#027) (note). God requires that they
should build him a tent, suited in some sort to his dignity and
eminence, because he was to act as their king, and to dwell among them;
and they were to consider themselves as his subjects, and in this
character to bring him presents, which was considered to be the duty of
every subject appearing before his prince. See [Exo
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#015).

[Exodus 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 25:3</span></span>

This is the offering - There were three kinds of metals:

1\. Gold, זהב zahab, which may properly signify wrought gold; what was
bright and resplendent, as the word implies. In [Job
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#015), [Job
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#016), [Job
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#017), [Job
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#019), gold is mentioned five times,
and four of the words are different in the original.

1\. סגור Segor, from סגר sagar, to shut up; gold in the mine, or shut up
in its ore.

2\. כתם Kethem, from כתם catham, to sign, seal, or stamp; gold made
current by being coined; standard or sterling gold, exhibiting the stamp
expressive of its value.

3\. זהב Zahab, wrought gold, pure, highly polished gold; probably what
was used for overlaying or gilding.

4\. פז Paz, denoting solidity, compactness, and strength; probably gold
formed into different kinds of plate, as it is joined in [Exo
25:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#017) of the above chapter with כלי
keley, vessels. The zahab, or pure gold, is here mentioned, because it
was in a state that rendered it capable of being variously manufactured
for the service of the sanctuary.

2\. Silver, כסף keseph, from casaph, to be pale, wan, or white; so
called from its well-known color.

3\. Brass, נחשת nechosheth, copper; unless we suppose that the
factitious metal commonly called brass is intended: this is formed by a
combination of the oxide or ore of zinc, called lapis calaminaris, with
copper. Brass seems to have been very anciently in use, as we find it
mentioned [Gen 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#022); and the
preparation of copper, to transform it into this factitious metal, seems
to be very pointedly referred to [Job
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#002) : Iron is taken out of the earth,
and brass is molten out of the stone; אבן יצוק נחושה eben yatsuk
nechushah, translated by the Vulgate, Lapis, solutus calore, in aes
vertitur, "The stone, liquefied by heat, is turned into brass." Is it
going too far to say that the stone here may refer to the lapis
calaminaris, which was used to turn the copper into brass? Because brass
was capable of so fine a polish as to become exceedingly bright, and
keep its lustre a considerable time, hence it was used for all weapons
of war and defensive armor among ancient nations; and copper seems to
have been in no repute, but for its use in making brass.

[Exodus 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 25:4</span></span>

Blue - תכלת techeleth, generally supposed to mean an azure or sky color;
rendered by the Septuagint ὑακινθον, and by the Vulgate hyacinthum, a
sky-blue or deep violet.

Purple - ארגמן argaman, a very precious color, extracted from the
purpura or murex, a species of shell-fish, from which it is supposed the
famous Tyrian purple came, so costly, and so much celebrated in
antiquity. See this largely described, and the manner of dyeing it, in
Pliny, Hist. Nat., lib. ix., c. 60-65, edit. Bipont.

Scarlet - תולעת tolaath, signifies a worm, of which this colouring
matter was made; and, joined with שני shani, which signifies to repeat
or double, implies that to strike this color the wool or cloth was twice
dipped: hence the Vulgate renders the original coccum bis tinctum,
"scarlet twice dyed;" and to this Horace refers, Odar., lib. ii., od.
16, v. 35:

\- Te Bis Afro Murice

Tinctae Vestiunt Lanae -

"Thy robes the twice dyed purple stains."

It is the same color which the Arabs call al kermez, whence the French
cramoisi, and the English crimson. On this subject much may be seen in
Bochart, Calmet, and Scheuchzer.

Fine linen - שש shesh; whether this means linen, cotton, or silk, is not
agreed on among interpreters. Because שש shesh signifies six, the
rabbins suppose that it always signifies the fine linen of Egypt, in
which six folds constituted one thread; and that when a single fold was
meant, בד bad is the term used. See Clarke's note on [Gen
41:42](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#042).

Goats' hair - עזים izzim, goats, but used here elliptically for goats'
hair. In different parts of Asia Minor, Syria, Cilicia, and Phrygia, the
goats have long, fine, and beautiful hair, in some cases almost as fine
as silk, which they shear at proper times, and manufacture into
garments. From Virgil, Georg. iii., v. 305-311, we learn that goats'
hair manufactured into cloth was nearly of equal value with that formed
from wool.

Hae quoque non cura nobis leviore tuendae

Nec minor usus erit: quamvis Milesia magno

Vellera mutentur, Tyrios incocta rubores.

Nec minus interea barbas incanaque menta

Cinyphii tondent hirci, setasque comantes,

Usum in castrorum, et miseris velamina nautis.

"For hairy goats of equal profit are

With woolly sheep, and ask an equal care.

'Tis true the fleece when drunk with Tyrian juice

Is dearly sold, but not for needful use:

Meanwhile the pastor shears their hoary beards

And eases of their hair the loaden herds.

Their camelots, warm in tents, the soldier hold,

And shield the shivering mariner from the cold."

Dryden.

[Exodus 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 25:5</span></span>

Rams' skins dyed red - ערת אילם מאדמים oroth eylim meoddamim, literally,
the skins of red rams. It is a fact attested by many respectable
travelers, that in the Levant sheep are often to be met with that have
red or violet-coloured fleeces. And almost all ancient writers speak of
the same thing. Homer describes the rams of Polyphemus as having a
violet-coloured fleece.

Αρσενες οΐες ησαν εΰτρεφεες, δασυμαλλοι,

Καλοι τε, μεγαλοι τε, ιοδνεφες ειρος εχοντες.

Odyss., lib. ix., ver. 425.

"Strong were the rams, with native purple fair,

Well fed, and largest of the fleecy care."

Pope.

Pliny, Aristotle, and others mention the same. And from facts of this
kind it is very probable that the fable of the golden fleece had its
origin. In the Zetland Isles I have seen sheep with variously coloured
fleeces, some white, some black, some black and white, some of a very
fine chocolate color. Beholding those animals brought to my recollection
those words of Virgil:

\- Ipse sed in pratis Aries jam suave rubenti

Murice, jam croceo mutabit vellera luto.

Eclog. iv., ver. 43.

"No wool shall in dissembled colors shine;

But the luxurious father of the fold,

With native purple or unborrow'd gold,

Beneath his pompous fleece shall proudly sweat,

And under Tyrian robes the lamb shall bleat."

Dryden.

Badgers' skins - ערת תחשים oroth techashim. Few terms have afforded
greater perplexity to critics and commentators than this. Bochart has
exhausted the subject, and seems to have proved that no kind of animal
is here intended, but a color. None of the ancient versions acknowledge
an animal of any kind except the Chaldee, which seems to think the
badger is intended, and from it we have borrowed our translation of the
word. The Septuagint and Vulgate have skins dyed a violet color; the
Syriac, azure; the Arabic, black; the Coptic, violet; the modern Persic,
ram-skins, etc. The color contended for by Bochart is the hysginus,
which is a very deep blue. So Pliny, Coccoque tinctum Tyrio tingere, ut
fieret hysginum. "They dip crimson in purple to make the color called
hysginus." - Hist. Nat., lib. ix., c. 65, edit. Bipont.

Shittim wood - By some supposed to be the finest species of the cedar;
by others, the acacia Nilotica, a species of thorn, solid, light, and
very beautiful. This acacia is known to have been plentiful in Egypt,
and it abounds in Arabia Deserta, the very place in which Moses was when
he built the tabernacle; and hence it is reasonable to suppose that he
built it of that wood, which was every way proper for his purpose.

[Exodus 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 25:6</span></span>

Oil for the light - This they must have brought with them from Egypt,
for they could not get any in the wilderness where there were no olives;
but it is likely that this and some other directions refer more to what
was to be done when in their fixed and settled residence, than while
wandering in the wilderness.

Spices - To make a confection for sweet incense, abounded in different
parts of these countries.

[Exodus 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 25:7</span></span>

Onyx stones - We have already met with the stone called שהם shoham, [Gen
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#012), and acknowledged the difficulty
of ascertaining what is meant by it. Some think the onyx, some the
sardine, and some the emerald, is meant. We cannot say precisely what it
was; possibly it might have been that fine pale pebble, called the
Egyptian pebble, several specimens of which now lie before me, which
were brought from the coast of the Red Sea, and other parts in Egypt, by
a particular friend of mine, on purpose to add to my collection of
minerals. Stones to be set in the ephod - אבני מלאים abney milluim,
stones of filling up. Stones so cut as to be proper to be set in the
gold work of the breastplate.

The אפד ephod - It is very difficult to tell what this was, or in what
form it was made. It was a garment of some kind peculiar to the priests,
and ever considered essential to all the parts of Divine worship, for
without it no person attempted to inquire of God. As the word itself
comes from the root אפד aphad, he tied or bound close, Calmet supposes
that it was a kind of girdle, which, brought from behind the neck and
over the shoulders, and so hanging down before, was put cross upon the
stomach, and then carried round the waist, and thus made a girdle to the
tunic. Where the ephod crossed on the breast there was a square ornament
called חשן choshen, the breastplate, in which twelve precious stones
were set, each bearing one of the names of the twelve sons of Jacob
engraven on it. There were two sorts of ephods, one of plain linen for
the priests, the other very much embroidered for the high priest. As
there was nothing singular in this common sort, no particular
description is given; but that of the high priest is described very much
in detail [Exo 28:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#006). It was
distinguished from the common ephod by being composed of gold, blue,
purple, scarlet, fine twisted linen, and cunning work, i.e., superbly
ornamented and embroidered. This ephod was fastened on the shoulders
with two precious stones, on which the twelve names of the twelve tribes
of Israel were engraved, six names on each stone. These two stones, thus
engraved, were different from those on the breastplate, with which they
have been confounded. From Calmet's description the ephod seems to have
been a series of belts, fastened to a collar, which were intended to
keep the garments of the priest closely attached to his body: but there
is some reason to believe that it was a sort of garment like that worn
by our heralds; it covered the back, breast, and belly, and was open at
the sides. A piece of the same kind of stuff with itself united it on
the shoulders, where the two stones, already mentioned, were placed, and
it was probably without sleeves. See Clarke on [Exo
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#002) (note), etc.

[Exodus 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 25:8</span></span>

Let them make me a sanctuary - מקדש mikdash, a holy place, such as God
might dwell in; this was that part of the tabernacle that was called the
most holy place, into which the high priest entered only once a year, on
the great day of atonement.

That I may dwell among them - "This," says Mr. Ainsworth, "was the main
end of all; and to this all the particulars are to be referred, and by
this they are to be opened. For this sanctuary, as Solomon's temple
afterwards, was the place of prayer, and of the public service of God,
[Lev 17:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#004); [Mat
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#013); and it signified the Church
which is the habitation of God through the Spirit, [Co2
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#016); [Eph
2:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#019); [Rev
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002), [Rev
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#003); and was a visible sign of God's
presence and protection, [Lev 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#011),
[Lev 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#012); [Eze
37:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#027), [Eze
37:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#028); [Kg1
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#012), [Kg1
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#013); and of his leading them to his
heavenly glory. For as the high priest entered into the tabernacle, and
through the veil into the most holy place where God dwelt; so Christ
entered into the holy of holies, and we also enter through the veil,
that is to say his flesh. See the use made of this by the apostle,
Hebrews 9 and 10. Thus the sanctuary is to be applied as a type,

1\. To Christ's person, [Heb 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#002); [Heb
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#011), [Heb
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012); [Joh
2:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019).

2\. To every Christian, [Co1 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#019).

3\. To the Church; both particular, [Heb
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#006); [Ti1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015); and universal, [Heb
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#021) : and it was because of the very
extensive signification of this building, that the different things
concerning this sanctuary are particularly set down by Moses, and so
variously applied by the prophets and by the apostles." - See Ainsworth.

As the dwelling in this tabernacle was the highest proof of God's grace
and mercy towards the Israelites, so it typified Christ's dwelling by
faith in the hearts of believers, and thus giving them the highest and
surest proof of their reconciliation to God, and of his love and favor
to them; see [Eph 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#022); [Eph
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#017).

[Exodus 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 25:9</span></span>

After the pattern of the tabernacle - It has been supposed that there
had been a tabernacle before that erected by Moses, though it probably
did not now exist; but the tabernacle which Moses is ordered to make was
to be formed exactly on the model of this ancient one, the pattern of
which God showed him in the mount, [Exo
25:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#040). The word משכן mishcan signifies
literally the dwelling or habitation; and this was so called because it
was the dwelling place of God; and the only place on the earth in which
he made himself manifest. See Clarke's note on [Exo
25:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#040), and on [Exo
33:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#007).

[Exodus 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 25:10</span></span>

They shall make an ark - ארון aron signifies an ark, chest, coffer, or
coffin. It is used particularly to designate that chest or coffer in
which the testimony or two tables of the covenant was laid up, on the
top of which was the propitiatory or mercy-seat, (see on [Exo
25:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#017)), and at the end of which were
the cherubim of gold, ([Exo 25:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#018)),
between whom the visible sign of the presence of the supreme God
appeared as seated upon his throne. The ark was the most excellent of
all the holy things which belonged to the Mosaic economy, and for its
sake the tabernacle and the temple were built, [Exo
26:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#033); [Exo
40:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#018), [Exo
40:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#021). It was considered as conferring
a sanctity wherever it was fixed, 2 Chronicles 8;11; [Sa2
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#012).

Two cubits and a half shall be the length, etc. - About four feet five
inches in length, taking the cubit as twenty-one inches, and two feet
six inches in breadth and in depth. As this ark was chiefly intended to
deposit the two tables of stone in, which had been written by the finger
of God, we may very reasonably conjecture that the length of those
tables was not less than four feet and their breadth not less than two.
As to their thickness we can say nothing, as the depth of the ark was
intended for other matters besides the two tables, such as Aaron's rod,
the pot of manna, etc., etc., though probably these were laid up beside,
not in, the ark.

[Exodus 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 25:11</span></span>

A crown of gold round about - A border, or, as the Septuagint have it,
κυματια χρυσα στεπτα κυκλω, waves of gold wreathed round about.

[Exodus 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 25:15</span></span>

The staves - shall not be taken from it - Because it should ever be
considered as in readiness to be removed, God not having told them at
what hour he should command them to strike their tents. If the staves
were never to be taken out, how can it be said, as in [Num
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#006), that when the camp should set
forward, they should put in the staves thereof, which intimates that
when they encamped, they took out the staves, which appears to be
contrary to what is here said? To reconcile these two places, it has
been supposed, with great show of probability, that besides the staves
which passed through the rings of the ark, and by which it was carried,
there were two other staves or poles in the form of a bier or
handbarrow, on which the ark was laid in order to be transported in
their journeyings, when it and its own staves, still in their rings, had
been wrapped up in the covering of what is called badgers' skins and
blue cloth. The staves of the ark itself, which might be considered as
its handles simply to lift it by, were never taken out of their rings;
but the staves or poles which served as a bier were taken from under it
when they encamped.

[Exodus 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">exo 25:16</span></span>

The testimony - The two tables of stone which were not yet given; these
tables were called עדת eduth, from עד forward, onward, to bear witness
to or of a person or thing. Not only the tables of stone, but all the
contents of the ark, Aaron's rod, the pot of manna, the holy anointing
oil, etc., bore testimony to the Messiah in his prophetic, sacerdotal,
and regal offices.

[Exodus 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 25:17</span></span>

A mercy-seat - כפרת capporeth, from כפר caphar, to cover or overspread;
because by an act of pardon sins are represented as being covered, so
that they no longer appear in the eye of Divine justice to displease,
irritate, and call for punishment; and the person of the offender is
covered or protected from the stroke of the broken law. In the Greek
version of the Septuagint the word ιλαστηριον, hilasterion, is used,
which signifies a propitiatory, and is the name used by the apostle,
[Heb 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#005). This mercy-seat or
propitiatory was made of pure gold; it was properly the lid or covering
of that vessel so well known by the name of the ark and ark of the
covenant. On and before this, the high priest was to sprinkle the blood
of the expiatory sacrifices on the great day of atonement: and it was in
this place that God promised to meet the people, (see [Exo
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022)); for there he dwelt, and there
was the symbol of the Divine presence. At each end of this propitiatory
was a cherub, between whom this glory was manifested; hence in Scripture
it is so often said that he dwelleth between the cherubim. As the word
ιλαστηριον, propitiatory or mercy-seat, is applied to Christ, [Rom
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025), whom God hath set forth to be a
Propitiation (ιλαστηριον) through faith in his blood - for the remission
of sins that are past; hence we learn that Christ was the true
mercy-seat, the thing signified by the capporeth, to the ancient
believers. And we learn farther that it was by his blood that an
atonement was to be made for the sins of the world. And as God showed
himself between the cherubim over this propitiatory or mercy-seat, so it
is said, God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself; [Co2
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019), etc. See on Leviticus 7 (note).

[Exodus 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 25:18</span></span>

Thou shalt make two cherubims - What these were we cannot distinctly
say. It is generally supposed that a cherub was a creature with four
heads and one body: and the animals, of which these emblematical forms
consisted, were the noblest of their kinds; the lion among the wild
beasts, the bull among the tame ones, the eagle among the birds, and man
at the head of all; so that they might be, says Dr. Priestley, the
representatives of all nature. Concerning their forms and design there
is much difference of opinion among divines. It is probable that the
term often means a figure of any kind, such as was ordinarily sculptured
on stone, engraved on metal, carved on wood, or embroidered on cloth.
See on [Exo 35:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#008) (note). It may be
only necessary to add, that cherub is the singular number; cherubim, not
cherubims, the plural. See what has been said on this subject in the
note on [Gen 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#024) (note).

[Exodus 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 25:22</span></span>

And there I will meet with thee - That is, over the mercy-seat, between
the cherubim. In this place God chose to give the most especial
manifestations of himself; here the Divine glory was to be seen; and
here Moses was to come in order to consult Jehovah, relative to the
management of the people.

Ainsworth has remarked that the rabbins say, "The heart of man may be
likened to God's sanctuary; for as, in the sanctuary, the shechinah or
Divine glory dwelt, because there were the ark, the tables, and the
cherubim; so, in the heart of man, it is meet that a place be made for
the Divine Majesty to dwell in, and that it be the holy of holies." This
is a doctrine most implicitly taught by the apostles; and the absolute
necessity of having the heart made a habitation of God through the
Spirit, is strongly and frequently insisted on through the whole of the
New Testament. See the note on [Exo
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#023).

[Exodus 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">exo 25:23</span></span>

Thou shalt also make a table of shittim wood - The same wood, the
acacia, of which the arkstaves, etc., were made. On the subject of the
ark, table of shew-bread, etc., Dr. Cudworth, in his very learned and
excellent treatise on the Lord's Supper, has the following remarks: -

"When God had brought the children of Israel out of Egypt, resolving to
manifest himself in a peculiar manner present among them, he thought
good to dwell amongst them in a visible and external manner; and
therefore, while they were in the wilderness, and sojourned in tents, he
would have a tent or tabernacle built to sojourn with them also. This
mystery of the tabernacle was fully understood by the learned
Nachmanides, who, in few words, but pregnant, expresseth himself to this
purpose: 'The mystery of the tabernacle was this, that it was to be a
place for the shechinah, or habitation of Divinity, to be fixed in;' and
this, no doubt, as a special type of God's future dwelling in Christ's
human nature, which was the True Shechinah: but when the Jews were come
into their land, and had there built them houses, God intended to have a
fixed dwelling-house also; and therefore his movable tabernacle was to
be turned into a standing temple. Now the tabernacle or temple, being
thus as a house for God to dwell in visibly, to make up the notion of
dwelling or habitation complete there must be all things suitable to a
house belonging to it; hence, in the holy place, there must be a table,
and a candlestick, because this was the ordinary furniture of a room, as
the fore-commended Nachmanides observes. The table must have its dishes,
and spoons, and bowls, and covers belonging to it, though they were
never used; and always be furnished with bread upon it. The candlestick
must have its lamps continually burning. Hence also there must be a
continual fire kept in this house of God upon the altar, as the focus of
it; to which notion I conceive the Prophet Isaiah doth allude, [Isa
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#009) : Whose fire is in Zion, and his
furnace in Jerusalem; and besides all this, to carry the notion still
farther, there must be some constant meat and provision brought into
this house; which was done in the sacrifices that were partly consumed
by fire upon God's own altar, and partly eaten by the priests, who were
God's family, and therefore to be maintained by him. That which was
consumed upon God's altar was accounted God's mess, as appeareth from
[Mal 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#012), where the altar is called
God's table, and the sacrifice upon it, God's meat: Ye say, The table of
the Lord is polluted; and the fruit thereof, even His Meat, is
contemptible. And often, in the law, the sacrifice is called God's לחם
lechem, i.e., his bread or food. Wherefore it is farther observable,
that besides the flesh of the beast offered up in sacrifice, there was a
minchah, i.e., a meat-offering, or rather bread-offering, made of flour
and oil; and a libamen or drink-offering, which was always joined with
the daily sacrifice, as the bread and drink which was to go along with
God's meat. It was also strictly commanded that there should be salt in
every sacrifice and oblation, because all meat is unsavoury without
salt, as Nachmanides hath here also well observed; 'because it was not
honorable that God's meat should be unsavoury, without salt.' Lastly,
all these things were to be consumed on the altar only by the holy fire
which came down from heaven, because they were God's portion, and
therefore to be eaten or consumed by himself in an extraordinary
manner." See Clarke on [Exo 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022)
(note).

[Exodus 25:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">exo 25:29</span></span>

The dishes thereof - קערתיו kearothaiv, probably the deep bowls in which
they kneaded the mass out of which they made the shew-bread.

And spoons thereof - כפתיו cappothaiu, probably censers, on which they
put up the incense; as seems pretty evident from [Num
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#014), [Num
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#020), [Num
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#026), [Num
7:32](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#032), [Num

7:62](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#062), [Num
7:68](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#068), [Num
7:74](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#074), [Num
7:80](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#080), [Num
7:86](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#086), where the same word is used, and
the instrument, whatever it was, is always represented as being filled
with incense.

Covers thereof - קשותיו kesothaiv, supposed to be a large cup or
tankard, in which pure wine was kept on the table along with the
shewbread for libations, which were poured out before the Lord every
Sabbath, when the old bread was removed, and the new bread laid on the
table.

Bowls thereof - מנקיתיו menakkiyothaiv, from נקה nakah, to clear away,
remove, empty, etc.; supposed by Calmet to mean, either the sieves by
which the Levites cleansed the wheat they made into bread, (for it is
asserted that the grain, out of which the shew-bread was made, was
sowed, reaped, ground, sifted, kneaded, baked, etc., by the Levites
themselves), or the ovens in which the bread was baked. Others suppose
they were vessels which they dipped into the kesoth, to take out the
wine for libations.

[Exodus 25:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">exo 25:30</span></span>

Shew-bread - לחם פנים lechem panim literally, bread of faces; so called,
either because they were placed before the presence or face of God in
the sanctuary, or because they were made square, as the Jews will have
it. It is probable that they were in the form of cubes or hexaedrons,
each side presenting the same appearance; and hence the Jews might
suppose they were called the bread or loaves of faces: but the Hebrew
text seems to intimate that they were called the bread of faces, פנים
panim, because, as the Lord says, they were set לפני lephanai, before my
Face. These loaves or cakes were twelve, representing, as is generally
supposed, the twelve tribes of Israel. They were in two rows of six
each. On the top of each row there was a golden dish with frankincense,
which was burned before the Lord, as a memorial, at the end of the week,
when the old loaves were removed and replaced by new ones, the priests
taking the former for their domestic use.

It is more difficult to ascertain the use of these, or what they
represented, than almost any other emblem in the whole Jewish economy.
Many have conjectured their meaning, and I feel no disposition to
increase their number by any addition of my own. The note on [Exo
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#023), from Dr. Cudworth, appears to
me more rational than any thing else I have met with. The tabernacle was
God's house, and in it he had his table, his bread, his wine,
candlestick, etc., to show them that he had taken up his dwelling among
them. See Clarke's note on [Exo 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#023).

[Exodus 25:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">exo 25:31</span></span>

A candlestick of pure gold - This candlestick or chandelier is generally
described as having one shaft or stock, with six branches proceeding
from it, adorned at equal distances with six flowers like lilies, with
as many bowls and knops placed alternately. On each of the branches
there was a lamp, and one on the top of the shaft which occupied the
center; thus there were seven lamps in all, [Exo
25:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#037). These seven lamps were lighted
every evening and extinguished every morning.

We are not so certain of the precise form of any instrument or utensil
of the tabernacle or temple, as we are of this, the golden table, and
the two silver trumpets.

Titus, after the overthrow of Jerusalem, a.d. 70, had the golden
candlestick and the golden table of the shew-bread, the silver trumpets,
and the book of the law, taken out of the temple and carried in triumph
to Rome; and Vespasian lodged them in the temple which he had
consecrated to the goddess of Peace. Some plants also of the balm of
Jericho are said to have been carried in the procession. At the foot of
Mount Palatine there are the ruins of an arch, on which the triumph of
Titus for his conquest of the Jews is represented, and on which the
several monuments which were carried in the procession are sculptured,
and particularly the golden candlestick, the table of the shew-bread and
the two silver trumpets. A correct Model of this arch, taken on the
spot, now stands before me; and the spoils of the temple, the
candlestick, the golden table, and the two trumpets, are represented on
the panel on the left hand, in the inside of the arch, in basso-relievo.
The candlestick is not so ornamented as it appears in many prints; at
the same time it looks much better than it does in the engraving of this
arch given by Montfaucon, Antiq. Expliq., vol. iv., pl. 32. It is likely
that on the real arch this candlestick is less in size than the
original, as it scarcely measures three feet in height. See the Diarium
Italicum, p. 129. To see these sacred articles given up by that God who
ordered them to be made according to a pattern exhibited by himself,
gracing the triumph of a heathen emperor, and at last consecrated to an
idol, affords melancholy reflections to a pious mind. But these things
had accomplished the end for which they were instituted, and were now of
no farther use. The glorious personage typified by all this ancient
apparatus, had about seventy years before this made his appearance. The
true light was come, and the Holy Spirit poured out from on high; and
therefore the golden candlestick, by which they were typified, was given
up. The ever-during bread had been sent from heaven; and therefore the
golden table, which bore its representative, the shew-bread, was now no
longer needful. The joyful sound of the everlasting Gospel was then
published in the world; and therefore the silver trumpets that typified
this were carried into captivity, and their sound was no more to be
heard. Strange providence but unutterable mercy of God! The Jews lost
both the sign and the thing signified; and that very people, who
destroyed the holy city, carried away the spoils of the temple, and
dedicated them to the objects of their idolatry, were the first in the
universe to receive the preaching of the Gospel, the light of salvation,
and the bread of life! There is a sort of coincidence or association
here, which is worthy of the most serious observation. The Jews had
these significant emblems to lead them to, and prepare them for, the
things signified. They trusted in the former, and rejected the latter!
God therefore deprived them of both, and gave up their temple to the
spoilers, their land to desolation, and themselves to captivity and to
the sword. The heathens then carried away the emblems of their
salvation, and God shortly gave unto those heathens that very salvation
of which these things were the emblems! Thus because of their unbelief
and rebellion, the kingdom of heaven, according to the prediction of our
blessed Lord, was taken from the Jews, and given to a nation (the
Gentiles) that brought forth the fruits thereof; [Mat
21:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#043). Behold the Goodness and
Severity of God!

[Exodus 25:39](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">exo 25:39</span></span>

Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these vessels - That
is, a talent of gold in weight was used in making the candlestick, and
the different vessels and instruments which belonged to it. According to
Bishop Cumberland, a talent was three thousand shekels. As the
Israelites brought each half a shekel, [Exo
38:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#026), so that one hundred talents,
one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five shekels, were contributed by
six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty persons; by
halving the number of the Israelites, he finds they contributed three
hundred and one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five shekels in all.
Now, as we find that this number of shekels made one hundred talents,
and one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five shekels over, if we
subtract one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, the odd shekels,
from three hundred and one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, we
shall have for a remainder three hundred thousand, the number of shekels
in one hundred talents: and if this remainder be divided by one hundred,
the number of talents, it quotes three thousand, the number of shekels
in each talent. A silver shekel of the sanctuary, being equal, according
to Dr. Prideaux, to three shillings English, three thousand such shekels
will amount to four hundred and fifty pounds sterling; and, reckoning
gold to silver as fifteen to one, a talent of gold will amount to six
thousand seven hundred and fifty pounds sterling: to which add two
hundred and sixty-three pounds for the one thousand seven hundred and
seventy-five shekels, at three shillings each, and it makes a total of
seven thousand and thirteen pounds, which immense sum was expended on
the candlestick and its furniture. It is no wonder, then, (if the
candlestick in the second temple was equal in value to that in the
ancient tabernacle), that Titus should think it of sufficient
consequence to be one of the articles, with the golden table, and silver
trumpets, that should be employed to grace his triumph. Their intrinsic
worth was a matter of no consequence to Him whose are the silver and
gold, the earth and its fullness; they had accomplished their design,
and were of no farther use, either in the kingdom of providence, or the
kingdom of grace. See Clarke's note on [Exo
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#031), and see Clarke's note on [Exo
38:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#024).

[Exodus 25:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">exo 25:40</span></span>

And look that thou make, etc. - This verse should be understood as an
order to Moses after the tabernacle, etc., had been described to him; as
if he had said: "When thou comest to make all the things that I have
already described to thee, with the other matters of which I shall
afterwards treat, see that thou make every thing according to the
pattern which thou didst see in the mount." The Septuagint have it, κατα
τον τυτον τον δεδειγμενον σοι· according to the Type-form or fashion,
which was shown thee. It appears to me that St. Paul had this command
particularly in view when he gave that to his son Timothy which we find
in the second epistle, [Ti2 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#013) :
Ὑποτυπωσιν εχε ὑγιαινοντων λογων, ὡν παρ' εμου ηκουσας. "Hold fast the
Form of sound words which thou hast heard of me." The tabernacle was a
type of the Church of God; that Church is built upon the foundation of
the prophets and apostles, Jesus Christ being the chief cornerstone,
[Eph 2:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020) : the doctrines,
therefore, delivered by the prophets, Jesus Christ, and his apostles,
are essential to the constitution of this church. As God, therefore,
gave the plan or form according to which the tabernacle must be
constructed, so he gives the doctrines according to which the Christian
Church is to be modeled; and apostles, and subordinate builders, are to
have and hold fast that Form of sound words, and construct this heavenly
building according to that form or pattern which has come through the
express revelation of God.

In different parts of this work we have had occasion to remark that the
heathens borrowed their best things from Divine revelation, both as it
refers to what was pure in their doctrines, and significant in their
religious rites. Indeed, they seem in many cases to have studied the
closest imitation possible, consistent with the adaptation of all to
their preposterous and idolatrous worship. They had their Iao or Jove,
in imitation of the true Jehovah; and from different attributes of the
Divine Nature they formed an innumerable group of gods and goddesses.
They had also their temples in imitation of the temple of God; and in
these they had their holy and more holy places, in imitation of the
courts of the Lord's house. The heathen temples consisted of several
parts or divisions:

1\. The area or porch;

2\. The ναος or temple, similar to the nave of our churches;

3\. The adytum or holy place, called also penetrale and sacrarium; and,

4\. The οπισθοδομος or the inner temple, the most secret recess, where
they had their mysteria, and which answered to the holy of holies in the
tabernacle.

And as there is no evidence whatever that there was any temple among the
heathens prior to the tabernacle, it is reasonable to conclude that it
served as a model for all that they afterwards built. They had even
their portable temples, to imitate the tabernacle; and the shrines for
Diana, mentioned [Act 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#024), were of
this kind. They had even their arks or sacred coffers, where they kept
their most holy things, and the mysterious emblems of their religion;
together with candlesticks or lamps, to illuminate their temples, which
had few windows, to imitate the golden candlestick in the Mosaic
tabernacle. They had even their processions, in imitation of the
carrying about of the ark in the wilderness, accompanied by such
ceremonies as sufficiently show, to an unprejudiced mind, that they
borrowed them from this sacred original. Dr. Dodd has a good note on
this subject, which I shall take the liberty to extract.

Speaking of the ark, he says, "We meet with imitations of this Divinely
instituted emblem among several heathen nations. Thus Tacitus, De
Moribus Germanorum, cap. 40, informs us that the inhabitants of the
north of Germany, our Saxon ancestors, in general worshipped Herthum or
Hertham, i.e., the mother earth: Hertham being plainly derived from ארץ
arets, earth, and אם am, mother: and they believed her to interpose in
the affairs of men, and to visit nations: that to her, in a sacred grove
in a certain island of the ocean, a vehicle covered with a vestment was
consecrated, and allowed to be touched by the priests only, (compare
[Sa2 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#006), [Sa2
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#007); [Ch1
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#009), [Ch1
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#010)), who perceived when the goddess
entered into her secret place, penetrale, and with profound veneration
attended her vehicle, which was drawn by cows; see [Sa1
6:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#007). While the goddess was on her
progress, days of rejoicing were kept in every place which she
vouchsafed to visit; they engaged in no war, they handled no weapons;
peace and quietness were then only known, only relished, till the same
priest reconducted the goddess to her temple. Then the vehicle and
vestment, and, if you can believe it, the goddess herself, were washed
in a sacred lake."

Apuleius, De Aur. Asin., lib. ii., describing a solemn idolatrous
procession, after the Egyptian mode, says, "A chest, or ark, was carried
by another, containing their secret things, entirely concealing the
mysteries of religion."

And Plutarch, in his treatise De Iside, etc., describing the rites of
Osiris, says, "On the tenth day of the month, at night, they go down to
the sea; and the stolists, together with the priest, carry forth the
sacred chest, in which is a small boat or vessel of gold."

Pausanius likewise testifies, lib. vii., c. 19, that the ancient Trojans
had a sacred ark, wherein was the image of Bacchus, made by Vulcan,
which had been given to Dardanus by Jupiter. As the ark was deposited in
the holy of holies, so the heathens had in the inmost part of their
temples an adytum or penetrale, to which none had access but the
priests. And it is remarkable that, among the Mexicans, Vitzliputzli,
their supreme god, was represented under a human shape, sitting on a
throne, supported by an azure globe which they called heaven; four poles
or sticks came out from two sides of this globe, at the end of which
serpents' heads were carved, the whole making a litter which the priests
carried on their shoulders whenever the idol was shown in public -
Religious Ceremonies, vol. iii., p. 146.

Calmet remarks that the ancients used to dedicate candlesticks in the
temples of their gods, bearing a great number of lamps.

Pliny, Hist. Nat., lib. xxxiv., c. 3, mentions one made in the form of a
tree, with lamps in the likeness of apples, which Alexander the Great
consecrated in the temple of Apollo.

And Athenaeus, lib. xv., c. 19, 20, mentions one that supported three
hundred and sixty-five lamps, which Dionysius the younger, king of
Syracuse, dedicated in the Prytaneum at Athens. As the Egyptians,
according to the testimony of Clemens Alexandrinus, Strom., lib. i.,
were the first who used lamps in their temples, they probably borrowed
the use from the golden candlestick in the tabernacle and temple.

From the solemn and very particular charge, Look that thou make them
after their pattern, which was showed thee in the mount, it appears
plainly that God showed Moses a model of the tabernacle and all its
furniture; and to receive instructions relative to this was one part of
his employment while on the mount forty days with God. As God designed
that this building, and all that belonged to it, should be patterns or
representations of good things to come, it was indispensably necessary
that Moses should receive a model and specification of the whole,
according to which he might direct the different artificers in their
constructing the work.

1\. We may observe that the whole tabernacle and its furniture resembled
a dwelling-house and its furniture.

2\. That this tabernacle was the house of God, not merely for the
performance of his worship, but for his residence.

3\. That God had promised to dwell among this people, and this was the
habitation which he appointed for his glory.

4\. That the tabernacle, as well as the temple, was a type of the
incarnation of Jesus Christ. See [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014), and [Joh
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019), [Joh
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#021).

5\. That as the glory of God was manifested between the cherubim, above
the mercy-seat, in this tabernacle, so God was in Christ, and in him
dwelt all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.

6\. As in the tabernacle were found bread, light, etc., probably all
these were emblematical of the ample provision made in Christ for the
direction, support, and salvation of the soul of man. Of these, and many
other things in the law and the prophets, we shall know more when
mortality is swallowed up of life.
