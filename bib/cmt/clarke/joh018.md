### [John Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#001.md)

[John](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">joh 18:0</span></span>

Jesus passes the brook Cedron, and goes to the garden of Gethsemane,
[Joh 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#001.md). Judas, having betrayed him,
comes to the place with a troop of men to take him, [Joh
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#002.md), [Joh
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#003.md). Jesus addresses them, and they
fall to the ground, [Joh 18:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#004.md). He
addresses them again, and Peter smites Malchus, [Joh
18:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#007.md). They seize him and lead him
away to Caiaphas, [Joh 18:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#012.md). Peter
follows to the palace of the high priest, [Joh
18:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#015.md). The high priest questions
Christ concerning his doctrine, and Jesus answers, and is smitten, [Joh
18:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#019.md). Peter denies his Lord twice,
[Joh 18:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#024.md). Jesus is led to the
judgment hall, and Pilate and the Jews converse about him, [Joh
18:28-32](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#028.md). Pilate converses with Jesus,
who informs him of the spiritual nature of his kingdom, [Joh
18:33-37](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#033.md). Pilate returns to the Jews,
and declares Christ to be innocent, [Joh
18:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#038.md). He seeks to discharge him, and
the Jews clamor for his condemnation, [Joh
18:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#039.md), [Joh
18:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#040.md).

[John 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 18:1</span></span>

Over the brook Cedron - Having finished the prayer related in the
preceding chapter, our Lord went straight to the garden of Gethsemane,
[Mat 26:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#036.md), which was in the mount of
Olives, eastward of Jerusalem. This mount was separated from the city by
a very narrow valley, through the midst of which the brook Cedron ran:
see 1 Maccabees 12:37; Joseph. War, b. v. c. 2, s. 3. xii. 2. Cedron is
a very small rivulet, about six or seven feet broad, nor is it
constantly supplied with water, being dry all the year, except during
the rains. It is mentioned in the Old Testament: [Sa2
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#023.md); [Kg1
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#013.md); [Kg2
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#004.md). And it appears the evangelist
only mentions it here to call to remembrance what happened to David,
when he was driven from Jerusalem by his son Absalom, and he and his
followers obliged to pass the brook Cedron on foot: see [Sa2
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#023.md). All this was a very expressive
figure of what happened now to this second David, by the treachery of
one of his own disciples. This brook had its name probably from קדר
Kadar, he was black; it being the place into which the blood of the
sacrifices, and other filth of the city, ran. It was rather, says
Lightfoot, the sink, or the common sewer, of the city, than a brook.
Some copyists, mistaking Κεδρων for Greek, have changed του into των,
and thus have written των Κεδρων, of cedars, instead of του Κεδρων, the
brook of Cedron: but this last is undoubtedly the genuine reading.

A garden - Gethsemane: see on [Mat
26:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#036) (note.md).

The Jewish grandees had their gardens and pleasure grounds without the
city even in the mount of Olives. This is still a common custom among
the Asiatics.

St. John mentions nothing of the agony in the garden; probably because
he found it so amply related by all the other evangelists. As that
account should come in here, the reader is desired to consult the notes
on [Mat 26:36-47](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#036) (note.md). See also [Mar
14:30-36](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#030) (note.md), and [Luk
22:40-44](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#040) (note.md).

[John 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 18:2</span></span>

Judas - knew the place - As many had come from different quarters to
celebrate the passover at Jerusalem, it could not be an easy matter to
find lodging in the city: Jesus therefore chose to pass the night in the
garden with his disciples which, from this verse, and from [Luk
22:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#039.md), we find was his frequent
custom, though he often lodged in Bethany. But, as he had supped in the
city this evening, Judas took it for granted that he had not gone to
Bethany, and therefore was to be met with in the garden; and, having
given this information to the priests, they gave him some soldiers and
others that he might be the better enabled to seize and bring him away.

[John 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 18:3</span></span>

A band - Την σπειραν, The band or troop. Some think that the spira was
the same as the Roman cohort, and was the tenth part of a legion, which
consisted sometimes of 4200, and sometimes of 5000 foot. But Raphelius,
on [Mat 27:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#027.md), has clearly proved,
from Polybius, that the spira was no more than a tenth of the fourth
part of a legion. And as the number of the legion was uncertain, and
their divisions not at all equal, no person can tell how many the band
or spira contained. See many curious particulars in Raphelius on this
point, vol. i. p. 351, edit. 1747. This band was probably those Roman
soldiers given by the governor for the defense of the temple; and the
officers were those who belonged to the Sanhedrin.

With lanterns and torches - With these they had intended to search the
corners and caverns, provided Christ had hidden himself; for they could
not have needed them for any other purpose, it being now the fourteenth
day of the moon's age, in the month Nisan, and consequently she appeared
full and bright. The weapons mentioned here were probably no other than
clubs, staves, and instruments of that kind, as we may gather from [Mat
26:55](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#055.md); [Mar
14:48](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#048.md); [Luk
22:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#052.md). The swords mentioned by the
other evangelists were probably those of the Roman soldiers; the clubs
and staves belonged to the chief priest's officers.

[John 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 18:4</span></span>

Jesus knowing all things, etc. - He had gone through all his preaching,
working of miracles, and passion, and had nothing to do now but to offer
up himself on the cross; he therefore went forth to meet them, to
deliver himself up to death.

[John 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 18:5</span></span>

Jesus of Nazareth - They did not say this till after Judas kissed
Christ, which was the sign which he had agreed with the soldiers, etc.,
to give them, that they might know whom they were to seize: see [Mat
26:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#048.md). Though some harmonists place
the kiss after what is spoken in the ninth verse.

[John 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 18:6</span></span>

They went backward, and fell to the ground - None of the other
evangelists mentions this very important circumstance. Our Lord chose to
give them this proof of his infinite power, that they might know that
their power could not prevail against him if he chose to exert his
might, seeing that the very breath of his mouth confounded, drove back,
and struck them down to the earth. Thus by the blast of God they might
have perished, and by the breath of his nostrils they might have been
consumed: [Job 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#009.md).

[John 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 18:8</span></span>

Let these go their way - These words are rather words of authority, than
words of entreaty. I voluntarily give myself up to you, but you must not
molest one of these my disciples. At your peril injure them. Let them go
about their business. I have already given you a sufficient proof of my
power: I will not exert it in my own behalf, for I will lay down my life
for the sheep; but I will not permit you to injure the least of these.
It was certainly the supreme power of Christ that kept the soldiers and
the mob from destroying all the disciples present, when Peter had given
them such provocation, in cutting off the ear of Malchus. There were
probably no other disciples with Christ than Peter, James, and John, at
this time. see [Mat 26:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#037.md); [Mar
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#033.md).

[John 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 18:10</span></span>

Having a sword - See the note on [Luk
22:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#036.md).

Cut off his right ear - He probably designed to have cloven his scull in
two, but God turned it aside, and only permitted the ear to be taken
off; and this he would not have suffered, but only that he might have
the opportunity of giving them a most striking proof of his Divinity in
working an astonishing miracle on the occasion: see the notes on [Mat
26:51-56](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#051) (note.md).

The other three evangelists mention this transaction; but neither give
the name of Peter nor of Malchus, probably because both persons were
alive when they wrote; but it is likely both had been long dead before
St. John published his history.

[John 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 18:11</span></span>

The cup which my Father hath given me - The cup signifies, sometimes the
lot of life, whether prosperous or adverse: here it signifies the final
sufferings of Christ.

[John 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 18:12</span></span>

The captain - Χιλιαρχος, The chiliarch, or chief over one thousand men -
answering nearly to a colonel with us. See the note on [Luk
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#004.md). He was probably the prefect or
captain of the temple guard.

[John 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 18:13</span></span>

To Annas - This man must have had great authority in his nation:

1\. Because he had been a long time high priest;

2\. Because he had no less than five sons who successively enjoyed the
dignity of the high priesthood; and,

3\. Because his son-in-law Caiaphas was at this time in possession of
that office.

It is likely that Annas was chief of the Sanhedrin, and that it was to
him in that office that Christ was first brought. Some think that Annas
was still high priest, and that Caiaphas was only his deputy, though he
did the principal part of the business, and that it as because of this
that he is called high priest. But see the notes on [Mat
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#004.md), and [Luk
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#002.md).

That same year - The office was now no longer during life as formerly.
See the note on [Joh 11:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#049.md).

What is related in the 24th verse, Now Annas had sent him bound to
Caiaphas, comes properly in after the 13th verse. One of the Vienna MSS.
adds this verse here; the later Syriac has it in the margin, and St.
Cyril in the text.

[John 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 18:14</span></span>

Caiaphas was he which gave counsel, etc. - Therefore he was an improper
person to sit in judgment on Christ, whom he had prejudged and
precondemned: see on [Joh 11:50-52](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#050.md)
(note). But Christ must not be treated according to the rules of
justice: if he had, he could not have been put to death.

[John 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 18:15</span></span>

And - another disciple - Not That other disciple, for the article is
omitted by AD, two others; some editions; Syriac, Persic, Gothic, and
Nonnus. So the Vulgate is to be understood. There are many conjectures
who this disciple was: Jerome, Chrysostom, Theophylact, Nonnus, Lyra,
Erasmus, Piscator, and others, say it was John. It is true John
frequently mentions himself in the third person; but then he has always,
whom Jesus loved, as in [Joh 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#023.md);
[Joh 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#026.md); [Joh
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#007.md), [Joh
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#020.md), except in [Joh
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#035.md), where he has plainly pointed
out himself as writer of this Gospel; but, in the place before us, he
has mentioned no circumstance by which that disciple may be known to be
John. To this may be added that John being not only a Galilean, but a
fisherman by trade, it is not likely that he should have been known to
the high priest, as it is here said of that disciple who followed Jesus
with Peter. See Bishop Pearce and Calmet. The conjecture of Grotius is
the most likely: viz. that it was the person at whose house Jesus had
supped. St. Augustin, Tract. 113, speaks like a man of sound sense: We
should not decide hastily, says he, on a subject concerning which the
Scripture is silent.

[John 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 18:17</span></span>

The damsel that kept the door - Caezarius, a writer quoted by Calmet,
says this portress was named Ballila. It is worthy of remark that women,
especially old women, were employed by the ancients as porters. In [Sa2
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#006.md), both the Septuagint and Vulgate
make a woman porter to Ishbosheth. Aristophanes, in Vespis, v. 765,
mentions them in the same office and calls them Σηκις, Sekis, which
seems to signify a common maid-servant: -

Ὁτι την θυραν ανεῳξεν ἡ Σηκις λαθρα.

And Euripides, Troad. brings in Hecuba, complaining that she, who was
wont to sit upon a throne, is now reduced to the miserable necessity of
becoming a porter, or a nurse, in order to get a morsel of bread. And
Plautus, Curcul. Act. i. sc. 1, mentions an old woman who was keeper of
the gate: -

Anus hic solet cubitare custos janitrix.

Why they, in preference to men, should be pitched upon for this office,
I cannot conceive; but we find the usage was common in all ancient
nations. See the notes on [Mat 26:69](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#069.md).

[John 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 18:18</span></span>

Servants and officers - These belonged to the chief priests, etc.; the
Roman soldiers had probably been dismissed after having conducted Christ
to Annas.

[John 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 18:19</span></span>

Asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine - He probably asked
him by what authority, or in virtue of what right, he collected
disciples, formed a different sect, preached a new doctrine, and set
himself up for a public reformer? As religion was interested in these
things, the high priest was considered as being the proper judge. But
all this, with what follows, was transacted by night, and this was
contrary to established laws. For the Talmud states, Sanhed. c. iv. s.
1, that - "Criminal processes can neither commence not terminate, but
during the course of the day. If the person be acquitted, the sentence
may be pronounced during that day; but, if he be condemned, the sentence
cannot be pronounced till the next day. But no kind of judgment is to be
executed, either on the eve of the Sabbath, or the eve of any festival."
Nevertheless, to the lasting infamy of this people, Christ was
judicially interrogated and condemned during the night; and on the night
too of the passover, or, according to others, on the eve of that feast.
Thus, as I have remarked before, all the forms of justice were insulted
and outraged in the case of our Lord. In this his humiliation his
judgment was taken away. See [Act
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#033.md).

[John 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 18:20</span></span>

I spake openly to the world - To every person in the land
indiscriminately - to the people at large: the τῳ κοσμῳ, here, is
tantamount to the French tout le monde, all the world, i.e. every person
within reach. This is another proof that St. John uses the term world to
mean the Jewish people only; for it is certain our Lord did not preach
to the Gentiles. The answer of our Lord, mentioned in this and the
following verse, is such as became a person conscious of his own
innocence, and confident in the righteousness of his cause. I have
taught in the temple, in the synagogues, in all the principal cities,
towns, and villages, and through all the country. I have had no secret
school. You and your emissaries have watched me every where. No doctrine
has ever proceeded from my lips, but what was agreeable to the
righteousness of the law and the purity of God. My disciples, when they
have taught, have taught in the same way, and had the same witnesses.
Ask those who have attended our public ministrations, and hear whether
they can prove that I or my disciples have preached any false doctrines,
have ever troubled society, or disturbed the state. Attend to the
ordinary course of justice, call witnesses, let them make their
depositions, and then proceed to judge according to the evidence brought
before you.

[John 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 18:22</span></span>

One of the officers - struck Jesus - This was an outrage to all justice:
for a prisoner, before he is condemned, is ever considered to be under
the especial protection of justice; nor has any one a right to touch
him, but according to the direction of the law. But it has been observed
before that, if justice had been done to Christ, he could neither have
suffered nor died.

[John 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 18:24</span></span>

Now Annas had sent him, etc. - It has been observed before that the
proper place of this verse is immediately after the 13th; and, if it be
allowed to stand here, it should be read in a parenthesis, and
considered as a recapitulation of what had been before done.

[John 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 18:27</span></span>

And - the cock crew - Peter denied our Lord three times: -

Peter's First Denial.

I. This took place, when he was without, or beneath, in the hall of
Caiaphas's house. He was not in the higher part where Christ stood
before the high priest; but without that division of the hall, and in
the lower part with the servants and officers, at the fire kindled in
the midst of the hall, [Joh 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#016.md),
[Joh 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#018.md); and the girl who kept the
door had entered into the hall, where she charged Peter.

Peter's Second Denial.

II\. This was in a short time after the first, [Luk
22:58](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#058.md). Having once denied his Master,
he naturally retired from the place where his accuser was to the
vestibule of the hall, [Mat 26:71](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#071.md), and
it was the time of the first cock-crowing, or soon after midnight. After
remaining here a short time, perhaps an hour, another girl sees him, and
says to them who were standing by in the vestibule, that he was one of
them. Peter, to avoid this charge, withdraws into the hall, and warms
himself. The girl, and those to whom she had spoken, follow him; the
communication between the two places being immediate. Here a man
enforces the charge of the girl, according to Luke; and others urge it,
according to St. John; and Peter denies Jesus vehemently.

Peter's Third Denial.

III\. He was now in the hall, and also within sight of Jesus, though at
such a distance from him that Jesus could not know what passed, but in a
supernatural way. And, about an hour after his second denial, those who
stood by founded a third charge against him, on his being a Galilean,
which St. Luke says, [Luk 22:59](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#059.md), one
in particular strongly affirmed; and which, according to John, [Joh
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#026.md), was supported by one of
Malchus's relations. This occasioned a more vehement denial than before,
and immediately the cock crew the second time, which is eminently called
αλεκτοροφωνια. The first denial may have been between our twelve and
one; and the second between our two and three.

At the time of the third denial, [Luk
22:61](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#061.md) proves that Jesus was in the
same room with Peter. We must farther observe that Matthew, [Mat
26:57](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#057.md), lays the scene of Peter's
denials in the house of Caiaphas: whereas John, [Joh
18:15-23](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#015.md), seems to intimate that these
transactions took place in the house of Annas; but this difficulty
arises from the injudicious insertion of the particle ουν, therefore, in
[Joh 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#024.md), which should be omitted,
on the authority of ADES, Mt. BH, many others; besides some versions,
and some of the primitive fathers. Griesbach has left it out of the
text. See Bishop Newcome's Harm. notes, p. 48.

The time of Peter's denials happened during the space of the third Roman
watch, or that division of the night, between twelve and three, which is
called αλεκτοροφωνια, or cock-crowing, [Mar
13:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#035.md). Concerning the nature and
progress of Peter's denial, see the notes on [Mat
26:58](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#058.md), [Mat
26:69-75](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#069.md).

[John 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 18:28</span></span>

The hall of judgment - Εις το πραιτωριον, To the praetorium. This was
the house where Pilate lodged; hence called in our margin, Pilate's
house. The praetorium is so called from being the dwelling-place of the
praetor, or chief of the province. It was also the place where he held
his court, and tried causes.

St. John has omitted all that passed in the house of Caiaphas - the
accusations brought against Christ - the false witnesses - the insults
which he received in the house of the high priest - and the assembling
of the grand council, or Sanhedrin. These he found amply detailed by the
other three evangelists; and for this reason it appears that he omitted
them. John's is properly a supplementary Gospel.

Lest they should be defiled - The Jews considered even the touch of a
Gentile as a legal defilement; and therefore would not venture into the
praetorium, for fear of contracting some impurity, which would have
obliged them to separate themselves from all religious ordinances till
the evening, [Lev 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#010.md), [Lev
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#011.md), [Lev
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#019.md), [Lev
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#020.md).

That they might eat the passover - Some maintain that το πασχα here does
not mean the paschal lamb, but the other sacrifices which were offered
during the paschal solemnity - for this had been eaten the evening
before; and that our Lord was crucified the day after the passover.
Others have maintained that the paschal lamb is here meant; that this
was the proper day for sacrificing it; that it was on the very hour in
which it was offered that Christ expired on the cross; and that
therefore our Lord did not eat the Paschal lamb this year, or that he
ate it some hours before the common time. Bishop Pearce supposes that it
was lawful for the Jews to eat the paschal lamb any time between the
evening of Thursday and that of Friday. He conjectures too that this
permission was necessary on account of the immense number of lambs which
were to be killed for that purpose. When Cestius desired to know the
number of the Jews, he asked the priests how he might accomplish his
wish? They informed him that this might be known by the number of the
lambs slain at the passover, as never less than ten partook of one lamb,
though twenty might feast on it. On this mode of computation he found
the lambs to be 256,500; εικοσι πεντε μυριαδας ηριθμησαν, προς δε
ἑξακισχιλια και πεντακοσια. See Josephus, War, b. vi. c. 9. s. 3.

That Jesus ate a passover this last year of his life is sufficiently
evident from [Mat 26:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#017.md); [Mar
14:12-18](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#012.md); [Luk
22:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#008.md); and that he ate this passover
some hours before the ordinary time, and was himself slain at that hour
in which the paschal lamb was ordered by the law to be sacrificed, is
highly probable, if not absolutely certain. See the note on [Mat
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#020.md), and at the conclusion of the
chapter, where the subject, and the different opinions on it, are
largely considered.

Pilate then went out - This was an act of condescension; but, as the
Romans had confirmed to the Jews the free use of all their rites and
ceremonies, the governor could not do less than comply with them in this
matter. He went out to them, that they might not be obliged to come into
the hall, and thus run the risk of being defiled.

[John 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 18:30</span></span>

If he were not a malefactor - So they did not wish to make Pilate the
judge, but the executor of the sentence which they had already illegally
passed.

[John 18:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 18:31</span></span>

It is not lawful for us to put any man to death - They might have judged
Jesus according to their law, as Pilate bade them do; but they could
only excommunicate or scourge him. They might have voted him worthy of
death; but they could not put him to death, if any thing of a secular
nature were charged against him. The power of life and death was in all
probability taken from the Jews when Archelaus, king of Judea, was
banished to Vienna, and Judea was made a Roman province; and this
happened more than fifty years before the destruction of Jerusalem. But
the Romans suffered Herod, mentioned [Act
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#001.md), etc., to exercise the power of
life and death during his reign. See much on this point in Calmet and
Pearce. After all, I think it probable that, though the power of life
and death was taken away from the Jews, as far as it concerned affairs
of state, yet it was continued to them in matters which were wholly of
an ecclesiastical nature; and that they only applied thus to Pilate to
persuade him that they were proceeding against Christ as an enemy of the
state, and not as a transgressor of their own peculiar laws and customs.
Hence, though they assert that he should die according to their law,
because he made himself the Son of God, [Joh
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#007.md), yet they lay peculiar stress on
his being an enemy to the Roman government; and, when they found Pilate
disposed to let him go, they asserted that if he did he was not Caesar's
friend, [Joh 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#012.md). It was this that
intimidated Pilate, and induced him to give him up, that they might
crucify him. How they came to lose this power is accounted for in a
different manner by Dr. Lightfoot. His observations are very curious,
and are subjoined to the end of this chapter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joh 18:32</span></span>

That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled - Or, thus the word was
fulfilled. God permitted the Jews to lose the power of life and death,
in the sense before stated, that according to the Roman laws, which
punished sedition, etc., with the cross, Christ might be crucified,
according to his own prediction: [Joh
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#032.md), [Joh
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#014.md).

Art thou the king of the Jews? - St. Luke says, expressly, [Luk
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#002.md), that when the Jews brought him
to Pilate they began to accuse him as a rebel, who said he was king of
the Jews, and forbade the people to pay tribute to Caesar. It was in
consequence of this accusation that Pilate asked the question mentioned
in the text.

[John 18:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">joh 18:34</span></span>

Sayest thou this thing of thyself - That is, Is it because my enemies
thus accuse me, or because thou hast any suspicion of me, that thou
askest this question?

[John 18:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 18:35</span></span>

Am I a Jew? - That is, I am not a Jew, and cannot judge whether thou art
what is called the Christ, the king of the Jews. It is thy own
countrymen, and their spiritual rulers, who delivered thee up to me with
the above accusation.

What hast thou done? - If thou dost not profess thyself king over this
people, and an enemy to Caesar, what is it that thou hast done, for
which they desire thy condemnation?

[John 18:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">joh 18:36</span></span>

My kingdom is not of this world - It is purely spiritual and Divine. If
it had been of a secular nature, then my servants would have contended -
they would have opposed force with force, as the kingdoms of this world
do in their wars; but as my kingdom as not of this world, therefore no
resistance has been made. Eusebius relates, Hist. Eccles. lib. iii. c.
20, that "The relatives of our Lord were brought before Domitian, and
interrogated whether they were of the family of David; and what sort the
kingdom of Christ was, and where it would appear? They answered, that
this kingdom was neither of this world, nor of an earthly nature; that
it was altogether heavenly and angelical; and that it would not take
place till the end of the world."

[John 18:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 18:37</span></span>

Thou sayest - A common form of expression for, yes, it is so. I was born
into the world that I might set up and maintain a spiritual government:
but this government is established in and by truth. All that love truth,
hear my voice and attend to the spiritual doctrines I preach. It is by
truth alone that I influence the minds and govern the manners of my
subjects.

[John 18:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">joh 18:38</span></span>

What is truth - Among the sages of that time there were many opinions
concerning truth; and some had even supposed that it was a thing utterly
out of the reach of men. Pilate perhaps might have asked the question in
a mocking way; and his not staying to get an answer indicated that he
either despaired of getting a satisfactory one, or that he was
indifferent about it. This is the case with thousands: they appear
desirous of knowing the truth, but have not patience to wait in a proper
way to receive an answer to their question.

I find in him no fault - Having asked the above question, and being
convinced of our Lord's innocence, he went out to the Jews to testify
his convictions and to deliver him, if possible, out of their hands.

[John 18:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">joh 18:39</span></span>

But ye have a custom - Nothing relative to the origin or reason of this
custom is known. Commentators have swam in an ocean of conjecture on
this point. They have lost their labor, and made nothing out: see the
notes on [Mat 27:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#015.md); [Luk
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#017.md).

[John 18:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">joh 18:40</span></span>

Barabbas was a robber - See [Mat
27:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#016.md). The later Syriac has in the
margin, αρχιλῃστης, a chief robber, a captain of banditti, and it is
probable that this was the case. He was not only a person who lived by
plunder, but shed the blood of many of those whom he and his gang
robbed, and rose up against the Roman government, as we learn from [Luk
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#019.md). There never existed a more
perfidious, cruel, and murderous people than these Jews; and no wonder
they preferred a murderer to the Prince of peace. Christ himself had
said, If ye were of the world, the world would love its own. Like
cleaves to like: hence we need not be surprised to find the vilest
things still preferred to Christ, his kingdom, and his salvation.

1\. It is not easy to give the character of Pilate. From the manner of
his conduct, we scarcely can tell when he is in jest or in earnest. He
appears to have been fully convinced of the innocence of Christ; and
that the Jews, through envy and malice, desired his destruction. On this
ground he should have released him; but he was afraid to offend the
Jews. He knew they were an uneasy, factious, and seditious people; and
he was afraid to irritate them. Fiat justitia, ruat caelum! was no motto
of his. For fear of the clamors of this bad people, he permitted all the
forms and requisitions of justice to be outraged, and abandoned the most
innocent Jesus to their rage and malice. In this case he knew what was
truth, but did not follow its dictates; and he as hastily abandoned the
author of it as he did the question he had asked concerning it. Pilate,
it is true, was disposed to pity - the Jews were full of malice and
cruelty. They both, however, joined in the murder of our Lord. The most
that we can say for Pilate is, that he was disposed to justice, but was
not inclined to hazard his comfort or safety in doing it. He was an
easy, pliable man, who had no objection to do a right thing if it should
cost him no trouble; but he felt no disposition to make any sacrifice,
even in behalf of innocence, righteousness, and truth. In all the
business Pilate showed that he was not a good man; and the Jews proved
that they were of their father, the devil. See [Joh
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#008.md).

2\. As Dr. Lightfoot has entered into a regular examination of when and
how the Jews lost the power of life and death in criminal cases, it may
be necessary to lay before the reader a copious abstract of his
researches on this subject, founded on [Joh
18:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#031.md).

"It cannot be denied that all capital judgment, or sentence upon life,
had been taken from the Jews for above forty years before the
destruction of Jerusalem, as they oftentimes themselves confess. But how
came this to pass? It is commonly received that the Romans, at this time
the Jews' lords and masters, had taken from all their courts a power and
capacity of judging the capital matters. Let us superadd a few things
here. Rabh Cahna saith, When R. Ismael bar Jose lay sick, they sent to
him, saying, Pray, sir, tell us two or three things which thou didst
once tell us in the name of thy Father. He saith to them, A hundred and
fourscore years before the destruction of the temple, the wicked kingdom
(the Roman empire) reigned over Israel, fourscore years before the
destruction of the temple, they (the fathers of the Sanhedrin)
determined about the uncleanness of the heathen land, and about glass
vessels. Forty years before the destruction of the temple, the Sanhedrin
removed and sat in the Taberne. What is the meaning of this tradition?
Rabbi Isaac bar Abdimi saith, They did not judge judgments of mulcts.
The gloss is, Those are the judgments about fining any that offered
violence, that entice a maid, and the price of a servant. When,
therefore, they did not sit in the room Gazith, they did not judge about
these things, and so those judgments about mulcts or fines ceased.
Avodoh Zarah. fol. 82. Here we have one part of their judiciary power
lost; not taken away from them by the Romans, but falling of itself, as
it were, out of the hands of the Sanhedrin. Nor did the Romans indeed
take away their power of judging in capital matters; but they, by their
own oscitancy, supine and unreasonable lenity, lost it themselves, for
so the Gemara goes on: Rabh Hachman bar Isaac saith, Let him not say
that they did not judge judgments of mulcts, for they did not judge
capital judgments either. And whence comes this? When they saw that so
many murders and homicides multiplied upon them that they could not well
judge and call them to account, they said, It is better for us that we
remove from place to place; for how can we otherwise (sitting here and
not punishing them) not contract guilt upon ourselves?

"They thought themselves obliged to punish murderers while they sat in
the room Gazith, for the place itself engaged them to it. They are the
words of the Gemarists, upon which the gloss. The room Gazith was half
of it within, and half of it without, the holy place. The reason of
which was, that it was requisite that the council should sit near the
Divine Majesty. Hence it is that they say, Whoever constitutes an unfit
judge is as if he planted a grove by the altar of the Lord, as it is
written, Judges and officers shalt thou make thee; and it follows
presently after, Thou shalt not plant thee a grove near the altar of the
Lord thy God, [Deu 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#018.md), [Deu
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#021.md). They removed therefore from
Gazith, and sat in the Taberne; now though the Taberne were upon the
mountain of the temple, yet they did not sit so near the Divine Majesty
there as they did when they sat in the room Gazith.

"Let us now in order put the whole matter together.

"I. The Sanhedrin were most stupidly and unreasonably remiss in their
punishment of capital offenders; going upon this reason especially, that
they counted it so horrible a thing to put an Israelite to death.
Forsooth, he is of the seed of Abraham, of the blood and stock of
Israel, and you must have a care how you touch such a one!

"R. Eliezer bar Simeon had laid hold on some thieves. R. Joshua bar
Korchah sent to him, saying, O thou vinegar, the son of good wine! (i.e.
O thou wicked son of a good father!) how long wilt thou deliver the
people of God to the slaughter! He answered and said, I root the thorns
out of the vineyard. To whom the other: Let the Lord of the vineyard
come and root them out himself. Bava Meziah, fol. 83, 2. It is worth
noting, that the very thieves of Israel are the people of God; and they
must not be touched by any man, but referred to the judgment of God
himself!

"When R. Ismael bar R. Jose was constituted a magistrate by the king,
there happened some such thing to him; for Elias himself rebuked him,
saying, How long wilt thou deliver over the people of God to slaughter!
Ibid. fol. 64, 1. Hence that which we alleged elsewhere: The Sanhedrin
that happens to sentence any one to death within the space of seven
years, is termed a destroyer. R. Eliezer ben Azariah saith it is so, if
they should but condemn one within seventy years. Maccoth, fol. 7, 1.

"II. It is obvious to any one how this foolish remissness, and letting
loose the reins of judgment, would soon increase the numbers of robbers,
murderers, and all kinds of wickedness; and indeed they did so
abundantly multiply that the Sanhedrin neither could nor durst, as it
ought, call the criminals to account. The law slept, while wickedness
was in the height of its revels; and punitive justice was so out of
countenance that as to uncertain murders they made no search, and
against certain ones they framed no judgement. Since the time that
homicides multiplied, the beheading the heifer ceased. Sotoh, fol. 47,
1. And in the place before quoted in Avodah: When they saw the numbers
of murderers so greatly increase that they could not sit in judgment
upon them, they said, Let us remove, etc., fol. 8, 2. So in the case of
adultery, which we also observed in our notes on [Joh
8:3-11](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#003.md). Since the time that adultery
so openly advanced, under the second temple, they left off trying the
adultress by the bitter water, etc. Mainaon. in Sotoh, cap. 3.

"So that, we see, the liberty of judging in capital matters was no more
taken from the Jews by the Romans than the beheading of the heifer, or
the trial of the suspected wife by the bitter waters, was taken away by
them, which no one will affirm. It is a tradition of R. Chaia, from the
day wherein the temple was destroyed, though the Sanhedrin ceased, yet
the four kinds of death (which were wont to be inflicted by the
Sanhedrin) did not cease. For he that had deserved to be stoned to
death, either fell off from some house, or some wild beast tore and
devoured him. He that had deserved burning, either fell into some fire,
or some serpent bit him. He that had deserved to be slain (i.e. with the
sword) was either delivered into the hands of some heathen king, or was
murdered by robbers. He that had deserved strangling, was either drowned
in some river, or choked by a squinancy.

"This must be observed from the evangelists, that when they had Christ
in examination in the palace of the high priest all night, in the
morning the whole Sanhedrin met that they might pass sentence of death
upon him. Where then was this that they met? Questionless in the room
Gazith - at least if they adhered to their own rules and constitutions:
Thither they betook themselves sometimes upon urgent necessity. The
gloss before quoted excepts only the case of murder, with which, amongst
all their false accusations, they never charged Christ.

"But, however, suppose it were granted that the great council met either
in the Taberne, or some other place, (which yet agreed by no means with
their own tradition), did they deal truly, and as the matter really and
indeed was, with Pilate, when they tell him, It is not lawful for us to
put any man to death? He had said to them, Take ye him and judge him
according to your laws. We have indeed judged and condemned him, but we
cannot put any one to death. Was this that they said in fact true? How
came they then to stone the proto-martyr Stephen? How came they to stone
Ben Sarda at Lydda? Hieros. Sanhed. fol. 25, 4. How came they to burn
the priest's daughter alive that was taken in adultery? Bab. Sanhed.
fol. 52, 1, and 51, 1. It is probable that they had not put any one to
death as yet, since the time that they had removed out of Gazith, and so
might the easier persuade Pilate in that case. But their great design
was to throw off the odium of Christ's death from themselves; at least
among the vulgar crowd; fearing them, if the council should have decreed
his execution. They seek this evasion, therefore, which did not
altogether want some color and pretext of truth; and it succeeded
according to what they desired. Divine Providence so ordering it as the
evangelist intimates, [Joh 18:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#032.md), That
the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake signifying what
death he should die: that is, be crucified according to the custom of
the Romans. While I am upon this thought, I cannot but reflect upon that
passage, than which nothing is more worthy observation in the whole
description of the Roman beast in the Revelation, [Rev
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#004.md). The dragon which gave power to
the beast. We cannot say this of the Assyrian, Babylonish, or any other
monarchy; for the Holy Scriptures do not say it. But reason dictates,
and the event itself tells us, that there was something acted by the
Roman empire in behalf of the dragon, which was not compatible with any
other, that is, the putting of the Son of God to death. Which thing we
must remember as often as we recite that article of our creed, 'He
suffered under Pontius Pilate,' that is, was put to death by the Roman
empire,"
