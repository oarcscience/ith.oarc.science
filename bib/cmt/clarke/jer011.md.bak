### [Jeremiah Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 11:0</span></span>

The prophet proclaims the tenor of God's covenant with the Jews of old,
[Jer 11:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#001.md); and then reproves them
for their hereditary disobedience, [Jer
11:6-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#006.md). In consequence of this the
Almighty is introduced, declaring he will show them no pity, [Jer
11:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#011.md); forbidding Jeremiah to
intercede, [Jer 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#014.md); rejecting their
sacrifices, [Jer 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#015.md); and in a word,
condemning this fair but unfruitful tree to the fire, [Jer
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#016.md), [Jer
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#017.md). In what remains of the chapter
the prophet predicts evil to his neighbors of Anathoth, who had
conspired against him, [Jer 11:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#018.md).
"Let us," said they, "destroy this tree, with the fruit thereof," etc.,
alluding to what Jeremiah had said in the sixteenth verse.

[Jeremiah 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 11:1</span></span>

The word that came to Jeremiah - This discourse is supposed to have been
delivered in the first year of the reign of Zedekiah. See Dahler.

[Jeremiah 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 11:2</span></span>

Hear ye the words of this covenant - It is possible that the prophet
caused the words of the covenant made with their fathers in the desert
([Exo 24:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#004).md) to be read to them on
this occasion; or, at least, the blessings and the cursings which Moses
caused to be pronounced to the people as soon as they had set foot in
Canaan, Deuteronomy 27, 28.

[Jeremiah 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 11:3</span></span>

Cursed be the man that obeyeth not - After the reading, the prophet
appears to sum up the things contained in what was read to them; as if
he had said, "Ye hear what the Lord saith unto you: remember, the sum of
it is this: The man is cursed who obeyeth not; and he is blessed who
obeys. From these declarations God will not depart."

[Jeremiah 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 11:5</span></span>

So be it, O Lord - Let thy promises be fulfilled; and let the
incorrigible beware of thy threatenings!

[Jeremiah 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 11:6</span></span>

Proclaim all these words - Let the same covenant, with the blessings and
cursings, be read in every city of Judah, and in all the streets of
Jerusalem, that all the people may know their duty, their privileges,
and their danger.

[Jeremiah 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 11:9</span></span>

A conspiracy is found - They were all fratres conjurati, sworn brothers,
determined to cast off the Divine yoke, and no longer to have God to
reign over them.

[Jeremiah 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 11:10</span></span>

They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers - A great
reformation had taken place under the reign of Josiah, and the public
worship of idols had been abolished, and most of the high places
destroyed; but under the reign of his son and his successors, they had
turned back again to idolatry, and were become worse than ever. It
required a captivity to cure them of this propensity: and God sent one:
after that, there was no idolatry among the Jews.

[Jeremiah 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 11:12</span></span>

Go, and cry unto the gods - See [Jer
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#028.md).

[Jeremiah 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 11:14</span></span>

Therefore pray not thou for this people - I am determined to give them
up into the hands of their enemies; I will neither hear thy
intercession, nor regard their prayers. Their measure is full.

[Jeremiah 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 11:15</span></span>

What hath my beloved to do in mine house - This has been supposed to
refer to Abraham, Moses, or such eminent servants of God, whose
intercession was very powerful. Were even they to appear as
intercessors, their prayer should not be regarded. Others think that
this is an endearing expression which properly belonged to the
Israelites. When God took them into covenant with himself, they were
espoused to him, and therefore his beloved; but now that they have
forsaken him, and joined themselves to another, what have they to do
with his house or its ordinances, which they wish now to frequent with
vows and sacrifices, when they see the evil fast coming upon them? This
is probably the sense of this very obscure passage. Dr. Blayney
translates, "What hath my beloved to do in my house whilst she
practiseth wickedness? Shall vows and holy flesh (sacrifices) be allowed
to come from thee? When thou art malignant, shalt thou rejoice?"

[Jeremiah 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 11:16</span></span>

The Lord called thy name, A green olive tree - That is, he made thee
like a green olive - fair, flourishing, and fruitful; but thou art
degenerated, and God hath given the Chaldeans permission to burn thee
up.

[Jeremiah 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 11:18</span></span>

The Lord hath given me knowledge of it - The men of Anathoth had
conspired against his life, because he reproved them for their sins, and
denounced the judgments of God against them. Of this God had given him a
secret warning, that he might be on his guard.

[Jeremiah 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 11:19</span></span>

I was like a lamb or an ox - Dahler translates, "I was like a fattened
lamb that is led to the slaughter." Blayney, "I was like a tame lamb
that is led to slaughter." The word אלוף alluph, which we translate ox,
is taken by both as an adjective, qualifying the noun כבש kebes, a lamb.
It may probably signify a lamb brought up in the house-fed at home,
(אלוף alluph), instructed or nourished at home; perfectly innocent and
unsuspecting, while leading to the slaughter. This meaning the word will
bear in Arabic, for alaf signifies accustomed, familiar, (to or with any
person or thing); a companion, a comrade, an intimate friend. I
therefore think that ככבש אלוף kechebes alluph signifies, like the
familiar lamb - the lamb bred up in the house, in a state of friendship
with the family. The people of Anathoth were Jeremiah's townsmen; he was
born and bred among them; they were his familiar friends; and now they
lay wait for his life! All the Versions understood אלוף alluph as an
epithet of כבש kebes, a chosen, simple, innocent lamb.

Let us destroy the tree with the fruit - Let us slay the prophet, and
his prophecies will come to an end. The Targum has, Let us put mortal
poison in his food; and all the Versions understand it something in the
same way.

[Jeremiah 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 11:20</span></span>

Let me see thy vengeance on them - Rather, I shall see (אראה ereh) thy
punishment indicted on them.

[Jeremiah 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 11:22</span></span>

Behold, I will punish them - And the punishment is, Their young men
shall die by the sword of the Chaldeans; and their sons and daughters
shall die by the famine that shall come on the land through the
desolations occasioned by the Chaldean army.

[Jeremiah 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 11:23</span></span>

The year of their visitation - This punishment shall come in that year
in which I shall visit their iniquities upon them.
