### [Exodus Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#001)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 36:0</span></span>

Moses appoints Bezaleel, Aholiab, and their associates, to the work, and
delivers to them the free-will offerings of the people, [Exo
36:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#001). The people bring offerings
more than are needed for the work, and are only restrained by the
proclamation of Moses, [Exo 36:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#004).
The curtains, their loops, taches, etc., for the tabernacle, [Exo
36:8-18](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#008). The covering for the tent,
[Exo 36:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#019). The boards, [Exo
36:20-30](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#020). The bars, [Exo
36:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#031). The veil and its pillars,
[Exo 36:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#035), [Exo
36:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#036). The hangings and their pillars,
[Exo 36:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#037), [Exo
36:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#038).

[Exodus 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 36:1</span></span>

Then wrought, etc. - The first verse of this chapter should end the
preceding chapter, and this should begin with verse the second; as it
now stands, it does not make a very consistent sense. By reading the
first word ועשה veasah, then wrought, in the future tense instead of the
past, the proper connection will be preserved: for all grammarians know
that the conjunction ו vau is often conversive, i.e., it turns the
preterite tense of those verbs to which it is prefixed into the future,
and the future into the preterite: this power it evidently has here; and
joined with the last verse of the preceding chapter the connection will
appear thus, [Exo 36:30-35](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#030), etc.: The
Lord hath called by name Bezaleel and Aholiab; them hath he filled with
wisdom of heart to work all manner of work. [Exo
36:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#001) : And Bezaleel and Aholiab Shall
Work, and every wise-hearted man, in whom the Lord put wisdom.

[Exodus 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 36:5</span></span>

The people bring much more than enough - With what a liberal spirit do
these people bring their free-will offerings unto the Lords! Moses is
obliged to make a proclamation to prevent them from bringing any more,
as there was at present more than enough! Had Moses been intent upon
gain, and had he not been perfectly disinterested, he would have
encouraged them to continue their contributions, as thereby he might
have multiplied to himself gold, silver, and precious stones. But he was
doing the Lord's work, under the inspiration of the Divine Spirit, and
therefore he sought no secular gain. Indeed, this one circumstance is an
ample proof of it. Every thing necessary for the worship of God will be
cheerfully provided by a people whose hearts are in that worship. In a
state where all forms of religion and modes of worship are tolerated by
the laws, it would be well to find out some less exceptionable way of
providing for the national clergy than by tithes. Let them by all means
have the provision allowed them by the law; but let them not be
needlessly exposed to the resentment of the people by the mode in which
this provision is made, as this often alienates the affections of their
flocks from them, and exceedingly injures their usefulness. See Clarke's
note on [Gen 28:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#022), in fine, where the
subject is viewed on all sides.

[Exodus 36:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 36:8</span></span>

Cherubims of cunning work - See on [Exo
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#018) (note). Probably the word means
no more than figures of any kind wrought in the diaper fashion in the
loom, or by the needle in embroidery, or by the chisel or graving tool
in wood, stone, or metal; see Clarke on [Exo
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#018) (note). This meaning Houbigant
and other excellent critics contend for. In some places the word seems
to be restricted to express a particular figure then well known; but in
many other places it seems to imply any kind of figure commonly formed
by sculpture on stone, by carving on wood, by engraving upon brass, and
by weaving in the loom, etc.

[Exodus 36:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 36:9</span></span>

The length of one curtain - Concerning these curtains, see Clarke on
[Exo 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001) (note), etc.

[Exodus 36:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 36:20</span></span>

And he made boards - See Clarke's note on [Exo
26:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#015), etc.

[Exodus 36:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">exo 36:31</span></span>

He made bars - See on [Exo 26:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#026)
(note), etc.

[Exodus 36:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">exo 36:35</span></span>

He made a veil - See Clarke on [Exo
26:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#031) (note), etc.

[Exodus 36:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">exo 36:37</span></span>

Hanging for the - door - See Clarke on [Exo
26:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#036) (note), etc.

[Exodus 36:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">exo 36:38</span></span>

The five pillars of it with their hooks - Their capitals. See Clarke on
[Exo 26:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#032) (note), etc.

There is scarcely any thing particular in this chapter that has not been
touched on before; both it and the following to the end of the book
being in general a repetition of what we have already met in detail in
the preceding chapters from Exodus 25 to 31 inclusive, and to those the
reader is requested to refer. God had before commanded this work to be
done, and it was necessary to record the execution of it to show that
all was done according to the pattern shown to Moses; without this
detailed account we should not have known whether the work had ever been
executed according to the directions given.

At the commencement of this chapter the reader will observe that I have
advanced the dates a. m. and b.c. one year, without altering the year of
the exodus, which at first view may appear an error; the reason is, that
the above dates commenced at Tisri, but the years of the exodus are
dated from Abib.
