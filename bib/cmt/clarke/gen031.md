### [Genesis Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 31:0</span></span>

Laban and his sons envy Jacob, [Gen
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#001.md), [Gen
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#002.md); on which he is commanded by the
Lord to return to his own country, [Gen
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#003.md). Having called his wives
together, he lays before them a detailed statement of his situation in
reference to their father, [Gen
31:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#004.md); the services he had rendered
him, [Gen 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#006.md); the various attempts
made by Laban to defraud him of his hire, [Gen
31:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#007.md); how, by God's providence, his
evil designs had been counteracted, [Gen
31:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#008.md); and then informs them that he
is now called to return to his own country, [Gen
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#013.md). To the proposal of an immediate
departure, Leah and Rachel agree; and strengthen the propriety of the
measure by additional reasons, [Gen
31:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#014.md); on which Jacob collects all
his family, his flocks and his goods, and prepares for his departure,
[Gen 31:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#017.md), [Gen
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#018.md). Laban having gone to shear his
sheep, Rachel secretes his images, [Gen
31:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#019.md). Jacob and his family, unknown
to Laban, take their departure, [Gen
31:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#020.md), [Gen
31:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#021.md). On the third day Laban is
informed of their flight, [Gen 31:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#022.md);
and pursues them to Mount Gilead, [Gen
31:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#023.md). God appears to Laban in a
dream, and warns him not to molest Jacob, [Gen
31:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#024.md). He comes up with Jacob at Mount
Gilead, [Gen 31:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#025.md); reproaches him
with his clandestine departure, [Gen
31:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#026.md); and charges him with having
stolen his gods, [Gen 31:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#030.md). Jacob
vindicates himself, and protests his innocence in the matter of the
theft, [Gen 31:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#031.md), [Gen
31:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#032.md). Laban makes a general search
for his images in Jacob's, Leah's, Bilhah's, and Zilpah's tents; and not
finding them, proceeds to examine Rachel's, [Gen
31:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#033.md). Rachel, having hidden them
among the camel's furniture, sat upon them, [Gen
31:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#034.md); and making a delicate excuse
for not rising up, Laban desists from farther search, [Gen
31:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#035.md). Jacob, ignorant of Rachel's
theft, reproaches Laban for his suspicions, [Gen
31:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#036.md), [Gen
31:37](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#037.md); enumerates his long and
faithful services, his fatigues, and Laban's injustice, [Gen
31:38-41](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#038.md); and shows that it was owing
to God's goodness alone that he had any property, [Gen
31:42](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#042.md). Laban is moderated, and
proposes a covenant, [Gen 31:43](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#043.md), [Gen
31:44](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#044.md). Jacob sets up a stone, and the
rest bring stones and make a heap, which Laban calleth Jegar-Sahadutha,
and Jacob Galeed, [Gen 31:45-47](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#045.md). They
make a covenant, and confirm it by an oath, [Gen
31:48-53](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#048.md). Jacob offers a sacrifice;
they eat together; and Laban and his companions, having lodged in the
mount all night, take a friendly leave of Jacob and his family next
morning, and depart, [Gen 31:54](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#054.md), [Gen
31:55](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#055.md).

[Genesis 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 31:1</span></span>

And he heard the words of Laban's sons - The multiplication of Jacob's
cattle, and the decrease and degeneracy of those of Laban, were
sufficient to arouse the jealousy of Laban's sons. This, with Laban's
unfair treatment, and the direction he received from God, determined him
to return to his own country.

Hath he gotten all this glory - All these riches, this wealth, or
property. The original word כבד signifies both to be rich and to be
heavy; and perhaps for this simple reason, that riches ever bring with
them heavy weight and burden of cares and anxieties.

[Genesis 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 31:3</span></span>

And the Lord said unto Jacob, Return - and I will be with thee - I will
take the same care of thee in thy return, as I took of thee on thy way
to this place. The Targum reads, My Word shall be for thy help, see [Gen
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#001.md). A promise of this kind was
essentially necessary for the encouragement of Jacob, especially at this
time; and no doubt it was a powerful means of support to him through the
whole journey; and it was particularly so when he heard that his brother
was coming to meet him, with four hundred men in his retinue, [Gen
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#006.md). At that time he went and pleaded
the very words of this promise with God, [Gen
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#009.md).

[Genesis 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 31:4</span></span>

Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah - He had probably been at some
considerable distance with the flocks; and for the greater secrecy, he
rather sends for them to the field, to consult them on this most
momentous affair, than visit them in their tents, where probably some of
the family of Laban might overhear their conversation, though Laban
himself was at the time three days' journey off. It is possible that
Jacob shore his sheep at the same time; and that he sent for his wives
and household furniture to erect tents on the spot, that they might
partake of the festivities usual on such occasions. Thus they might all
depart without being suspected.

[Genesis 31:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 31:7</span></span>

Changed my wages ten times - There is a strange diversity among the
ancient versions, and ancient and modern interpreters, on the meaning of
these words. The Hebrew is עשרת מנים asereth monim, which Aquila
translates δεκα αριθμους ten numbers; Symmachus, δεκακις αριτμῳ, ten
times in number; the Septuagint δεκα αμνων, ten lambs, with which Origen
appears to agree. St. Augustine thinks that by ten lambs five years'
wages is meant: that Laban had withheld from him all the party-coloured
lambs which had been brought forth for five years, and because the ewes
brought forth lambs twice in the year, bis gravidae pecudes, therefore
the number ten is used, Jacob having been defrauded of his part of the
produce of ten births. It is supposed that the Septuagint use lambs for
years, as Virgil does aristas.

En unquam patrios longo post tempore fines,

Pauperis et tuguri congestum cespite culmen,

Post aliquot mea regna videns mirabor aristas?

Virg. Ec. i., ver. 68.

Thus inadequately translated by Dryden:

O must the wretched exiles ever mourn;

Nor, after length of rolling years, return?

Are we condemn'd by Fate's unjust decree,

No more our harvests and our homes to see?

Or shall we mount again the rural throng,

And rule the country, kingdoms once our own?

Here aristas, which signifies ears of corn, is put for harvest, harvest
for autumn, and autumn for years. After all, it is most natural to
suppose that Jacob uses the word ten times for an indefinite number,
which we might safely translate frequently; and that it means an
indefinite number in other parts of the sacred writings, is evident from
[Lev 26:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#026.md) : Ten women shall bake your
bread in one oven. [Ecc 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#019.md) : Wisdom
strengtheneth the wise more than Ten mighty men the city. [Num
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#022.md) : Because all these men have
tempted me now these Ten times. [Job
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#003.md) : These Ten times have ye
reproached me. [Zac 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#023.md) : In those
days - Ten men shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew. [Rev
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#010.md) : Ye shall have tribulation Ten
days.

[Genesis 31:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 31:11</span></span>

The angel of God spake unto me in a dream - It is strange that we had
not heard of this dream before; and yet it seems to have taken place
before the cattle brought forth, immediately after the bargain between
him and Laban. If we follow the Samaritan the difficulty is at once
removed, for it gives us the whole of this dream after [Gen
30:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#036.md) of the preceding chapter,

[Genesis 31:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 31:12</span></span>

Grisled - ברדים beruddim; ברד barad signifies hail, and the meaning must
be, they had white spots on them similar to hail. Our word grisled comes
from the old French, gresl, hail, now written grle; hence gresl,
grisled, spotted with white upon a dark ground.

[Genesis 31:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 31:15</span></span>

Are we not counted of him strangers? - Rachel and Leah, who well knew
the disposition of their father, gave him here his true character. He
has treated us as strangers - as slaves whom he had a right to dispose
of as he pleased; in consequence, he hath sold us - disposed of us on
the mere principle of gaining by the sale.

And hath quite devoured also our money - Has applied to his own use the
profits of the sale, and has allowed us neither portion nor inheritance.

[Genesis 31:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gen 31:19</span></span>

Laban went to shear his sheep - Laban had gone; and this was a favorable
time not only to take his images, but to return to Canaan without being
perceived.

Rachel had stolen the images - תרפים teraphim. What the teraphim were is
utterly unknown. In [Gen 31:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#030.md) they
are termed אלהי elohai, gods; and to some it appears very likely that
they were a sort of images devoted to superstitious purposes, not
considered as gods, but as representatives of certain Divine attributes,
Dr. Shuckford supposes them to be a sort of tiles, on which the names or
figures of their ancestors were engraven. Theodoret, in his 89th
question, calls them idols; and says that Rachel, who was a type of the
true Church, stole them from her father that he might be delivered from
idolatry. R. S. Jarchi gives nearly the same reason.

The Targum of Jonathan ben Uzziel gives a strange turn to the whole
passage. "And Rachel stole the images of her father: for they had
murdered a man, who was a first-born son; and having cut off his head,
they embalmed it with salt and spices, and they wrote divinations upon a
plate of gold, and put it under his tongue; and placed it against the
wall, and it conversed with them, and Laban worshipped it. And Jacob
stole the science of Laban the Syrian, that it might not discover his
departure." If the word be derived from רפא mo rapha, to heal or
restore, then the teraphim may be considered as a sort of talismans,
kept for the purpose of averting and curing diseases; and probably were
kept by Laban for the same purpose that the Romans kept their lares and
penates. It is however possible that תרפים teraphim is the same as שרפים
seraphim, the ת tau and ש sin being changed, which is very frequent in
the Syrian or Chaldee language; and we know that Laban was an Aramean or
Syrian. Fire has been considered from the earliest ages as a symbol of
the Deity; and as the word seraphim comes from שרף saraph, to burn, it
has been conjectured that the teraphim of Laban were luminous forms,
prepared of burnished brass, etc., which he might imagine a proper
medium of communication between God and his worshippers. Mr. Parkhurst
has observed that the teraphim were in use among believers and
unbelievers. Among the former, see this chapter; for he denies that
Laban was an idolater. See also [Jdg
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#005.md);[Jdg
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#014.md), [Jdg
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#018.md), [Jdg
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#020.md); [Sa1
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#013.md), [Sa1
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#016.md). Among the latter, see [Kg2
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#024.md); [Eze
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#021.md); [Zac
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#002.md). Compare [Sa1
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#023.md), and [Hos
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#004.md). These are all the places in which
the original word is found.

The Persian translator seems to have considered these teraphim as tables
or instruments that served for purposes of judicial astrology, and hence
translates the word asterlabha, astrolabes. As the astrolabe was an
instrument with which they took the altitude of the pole-star, the sun,
etc., it might, in the notion of the Persian translator, imply tables,
etc., by which the culminating of particular stars might be determined,
and the whole serve for purposes of judicial astrology. Now as many who
have professed themselves to be believers in Christianity, have
nevertheless addicted themselves to judicial astrology, we might suppose
such a thing in this case, and still consider Laban as no idolater. If
the Persian translator has not hit on the true meaning, he has formed
the most likely conjecture.

[Genesis 31:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 31:21</span></span>

Passed over the river - The Euphrates, as the Targum properly notices.
But how could he pass such a river with his flocks, etc.? This
difficulty does not seem to have struck critics in general. The rabbins
felt it, and assert that God wrought a miracle for Jacob on this
occasion, and that he passed over dry shod. As we know not in what other
way he could pass, it is prudent to refer it to the power of God, which
accompanied him through the whole of his journey. There might, however,
have been fords well known to both Jacob and Laban, by which they might
readily pass.

The mount Gilead - What the ancient name of this mountain was, we know
not; but it is likely that it had not the name of Gilead till after the
transaction mentioned [Gen 31:47](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#047.md). The
mountains of Gilead were eastward of the country possessed by the tribes
of Reuben and Gad; and extended from Mount Hermon to the mountains of
Moab - Calmet. It is joined to Mount Libanus, and includes the
mountainous region called in the New Testament Trachonitis - Dodd.

[Genesis 31:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gen 31:24</span></span>

And God came to Laban - God's caution to Laban was of high importance to
Jacob - Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad; or
rather, as is the literal meaning of the Hebrew, מטוב עד רע mittob ad
ra, from good to evil; for had he neither spoken good nor evil to Jacob,
they could have had no intercourse at all. The original is, therefore,
peculiarly appropriate; for when people meet, the language at first is
the language of friendship; the command therefore implies, "Do not begin
with Peace be unto thee, and then proceed to injurious language and acts
of violence." If this Divine direction were attended to, how many of
those affairs of honor, so termed, which commence with, "I hope you are
well" - "I am infinitely glad to see you" - "I am happy to see you
well," etc., and end with small swords and pistol bullets, would be
prevented! Where God and true religion act, all is fair, kind, honest,
and upright; but where these are not consulted, all is hollow,
deceitful, or malicious. Beware of unmeaning compliments, and
particularly of saying what thy heart feels not. God hates a hypocrite
and a deceiver.

[Genesis 31:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">gen 31:27</span></span>

I might have sent thee away with mirth - בשמחה, besimchah, with
rejoicing, making a feast or entertainment on the occasion; and with
songs, בשרים beshirim, odes either in the praise of God, or to
commemorate the splendid acts of their ancestors; with tabret, בתף
bethoph, the tympanum used in the east to the present day, and there
called diff, a thin broad wooden hoop, with parchment extended over one
end of it, to which are attached small pieces of brass, tin, etc., which
make a jingling noise; it is held in the air with one hand, and beat on
with the fingers of the other. It appears to have been precisely the
same with that which is called the tambourine and which is frequently to
be met with in our streets. And with harp, בכנור bekinnor, a sort of
stringed instrument, a lute or harp; probably the same as the Greek
κινυρα kinura, a harp; the name being evidently borrowed from the
Hebrew. These four things seem to include all that was used in those
primitive times, as expressive of gladness and satisfaction on the most
joyous occasions.

[Genesis 31:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 31:29</span></span>

It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt - Literally, My hand is
unto God to do you evil, i.e., I have vowed to God that I will punish
thee for thy flight, and the stealing of my teraphim; but the God of
Your father has prevented me from doing it. It is a singular instance
that the plural pronoun, when addressing an individual, should be twice
used in this place - the God of your father, אביכם abichem, for אביך
abicha, thy father.

[Genesis 31:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">gen 31:32</span></span>

Let him not live - It appears that anciently theft was punished by
death; and we know that the patriarchs had the power of life and death
in their hands. But previously to the law, the punishment of death was
scarcely ever inflicted but for murder. The rabbins consider that this
was an imprecation used by Jacob, as if he had said, Let God take away
the life of the person who has stolen them! And that this was answered
shortly after in the death of Rachel, [Gen
35:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#016.md).

[Genesis 31:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">gen 31:35</span></span>

The custom of women is upon me - This she knew must be a satisfactory
reason to her father; for if the teraphim were used to any religious
purpose, and they seem to have been used in this way, as Laban calls
them his gods, he therefore could not suspect that a woman in such a
situation, whose touch was considered as defiling, would have sat upon
articles that were either the objects of his adoration, or used for any
sacred purpose. The stratagem succeeded to her wish, and Laban departed
without suspicion. It seems very natural to suppose that Rachel did
believe that by the use of these teraphim Laban could find out their
flight, and the direction they took, and therefore she stole them; and
having stolen them she was afraid to acknowledge the theft, and probably
might think that they might be of some use to herself. Therefore, for
these reasons, she brought them away.

[Genesis 31:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">gen 31:36</span></span>

And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban - The expostulation of Jacob
with Laban, and their consequent agreement, are told in this place with
great spirit and dignity. Jacob was conscious that though he had made
use of cunning to increase his flocks, yet Laban had been on the whole a
great gainer by his services. He had served him at least twenty years,
fourteen for Rachel and Leah, and six for the cattle; and some suppose
he had served him twenty years besides the above, which is not unlikely:
see the remarks at the conclusion of this chapter. (See Clarke at [Gen
31:55](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#055) (note).md) Forty or even twenty
years of a man's life, devoted to incessant labor and constantly exposed
to all the inclemencies of the weather, (see [Gen
31:40](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#040).md), deserve more than an ordinary
reward. Laban's constitutional sin was covetousness, and it was an
easily besetting sin; for it appears to have governed all his conduct,
and to have rendered him regardless of the interests of his children, so
long as he could secure his own. That he had frequently falsified his
agreement with Jacob, though the particulars are not specified, we have
already had reason to conjecture from [Gen
31:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#007.md), and with this Jacob charges his
father-in-law, in the most positive manner, [Gen
31:41](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#041.md). Perhaps some previous unfair
transactions of this kind were the cause why Jacob was led to adopt the
expedient of outwitting Laban in the case of the spotted, spangled,
ring-streaked, and grisled cattle. This if it did take place, though it
cannot justify the measure, is some palliation of it; and almost the
whole of Jacob's conduct, as far as relates to Laban, can be better
excused than his injuring Laban's breed, by leaving him none but the
weak, unhealthy, and degenerated cattle.

[Genesis 31:39](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">gen 31:39</span></span>

That which was torn - of my hand didst thou require it - This more
particularly marks the covetous and rigorous disposition of Laban; for
the law of God required that what had been torn by beasts the shepherd
should not be obliged to make good, [Exo
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#010.md), [Exo
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#013.md). And it is very likely that this
law was in force from the earliest times.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">gen 31:40</span></span>

In the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night - The being
exposed to the heat by day, and frost by night, is made part of the
heaviest punishment of Promethus by Aeschylus.

Σταθευτος δ' ἡλιου φοιβῃ φλογι, Χροιας αμευψεις· ασμενῳ δε σοι

Opposed to the sun's most fervid beam, The hue of beauty changed; till

[Genesis 31:41](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">gen 31:41</span></span>

Twenty years - See the remarks at the end, [Gen

[Genesis 31:42](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">gen 31:42</span></span>

The fear of Isaac - It is strange that Jacob should say, the God of
Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, when both words are meant of the same
Being. The reason perhaps was this; Abraham was long since dead, and God
was his unalienable portion for ever. Isaac was yet alive in a state of
probation, living in the fear of God, not exempt from the danger of
falling; therefore God is said to be his fear, not only the object of
his religious worship in a general way, but that holy and just God
before whom he was still working out his salvation with fear and
trembling, fear lest he should fall, and trembling lest he should
offend.

[Genesis 31:46](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#046.md)

Made a heap - גל gal, translated heap, signifies properly a round heap;
and this heap was probably made for the double purpose of an altar and a
table, and Jacob's stone or pillar was set on it for the purpose of a
memorial.

[Genesis 31:47](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">gen 31:47</span></span>

Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha - יגר שהדותא yegar sahadutha, the heap
or round heap of witness; but Jacob called it גלעד galed, which
signifies the same thing. The first is pure Chaldee, the second pure
Hebrew. אגר agar signifies to collect, hence יגר yegar and אוגר ogar, a
collection or heap made up of gathered stones; and hence also אגורא
egora, an altar, used frequently by the Chaldee paraphrast. See [Kg1
12:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#033.md); [Jdg
6:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#031.md); [Kg2
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#003.md); [Jer
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#001.md). See Castel's Lexicon. From this
example we may infer that the Chaldee language was nearly coequal with
the Hebrew. A gloss made by St. Jerome, and which was probably only
entered by him in his margin as a note, has crept into the text of the
Vulgate. It is found in every copy of this version, and is as follows:
Uterque juxta proprietatem linguae suae, Each according to the idiom of
his own tongue.

[Genesis 31:48](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">gen 31:48</span></span>

I think these two verses are badly divided, and should be read thus:

[Gen 31:48](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#048.md) - And Laban said, This heap
is a witness between me and thee this day.

[Gen 31:49](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#049.md) - Therefore was the name of
it called Galeed and Mizpah; for he said, The Lord watch between me and
thee, when we are absent one from another.

Mizpah - מעפה mitspah signifies a watch-tower; and Laban supposes that
in consequence of the consecration of the place, and the covenant now
solemnly made and ratified, that God would take possession of this heap,
and stand on it as on a watch-tower, to prevent either of them from
trenching on the conditions of their covenant.

[Genesis 31:50](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">gen 31:50</span></span>

No man is with us - Though all were present at the sacrifice offered,
yet it appears that in making the contract Jacob and Laban withdrew, and
transacted the business in private, calling on God to witness it.

Jacob had already four wives; but Laban feared that he might take
others, whose children would naturally come in for a share of the
inheritance to the prejudice of his daughters and grandchildren. Though
the Koran allows a man to have four wives if he can maintain them, yet
we learn that in many cases where a man takes a wife, the parents or
relatives of the woman stipulate that the man is not to take another
during the lifetime of that one whom he now espouses; and
notwithstanding the permission of the Koran, he is obliged to fulfill
this agreement.

[Genesis 31:51](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">gen 31:51</span></span>

And Laban said to Jacob - behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt
me and thee - But this pillar, not cast but set up, was certainly set up
by Jacob; for in [Gen 31:45](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#045.md) we read,
And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar: it is therefore for
the honor of one Hebrew and one Samaritan MS. that they have preserved
the true reading in [Gen 31:51](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#051.md), ירית
yaritha, Thou hast set up - Kennicott. Instead of either of the above
readings the Samaritan text has yarata, The pillar which thou Seest
betwixt me and thee.

[Genesis 31:53](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">gen 31:53</span></span>

The God of their father - As Laban certainly speaks of the true God
here, with what propriety can he say that this God was the God of Terah,
the father of Abraham and Nahor? It is certain that Terah was an
idolater; of this we have the most positive proof, [Jos
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#002.md). Because the clause is not in the
Septuagint, and is besides wanting in some MSS., Dr. Kennicott considers
it an interpolation. But there is no need of having recourse to this
expedient if we adopt the reading אביכם abichem, Your father, for אביהם
abihem, Their father, which is supported by several of Kennicott's and
De Rossi's MSS., and is precisely the same form made use of by Laban,
[Gen 31:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#029.md), when addressing Jacob, and
appears to me to be used here in the same way; for he there most
manifestly uses the plural pronoun, when speaking only to Jacob himself.

It is therefore to be considered as a form of speech peculiar to Laban;
at least we have two instances of his use of it in this chapter.

Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac - See Clarke on [Gen
31:42](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#042) (note.md).

[Genesis 31:54](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#054.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">gen 31:54</span></span>

Offered sacrifice upon the mount - It is very likely that Laban joined
in this solemn religious rite, and that, having offered the blood and
fat to God, they feasted upon the sacrifice.

[Genesis 31:55](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#055.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">gen 31:55</span></span>

Kissed his sons and his daughters - That is, his grandchildren, Jacob's
eleven sons with Dinah their sister, and their mothers Leah and Rachel.
All these he calls his children, [Gen
31:43](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#043.md). And blessed them - prayed
heartily for their prosperity, though we find from [Gen
31:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#029.md) that he came having bound
himself by a vow to God to do them some injury. Thus God turned his
intended curse into a blessing.

The most important topics in this chapter have already been considered
in the notes, and to those the reader is referred. Jacob's character we
have already seen, and hitherto have met in it little to admire; but we
shall soon find a blessed change both in his mind and in his conduct.
Laban's character appears in almost every instance to disadvantage; he
does not seem to be what we commonly term a wicked man, but he was
certainly both weak and covetous; and covetousness extinguished in him,
as it does in all its votaries, the principles of righteousness and
benevolence, and the very charities of human life. Provided he could get
an increase of property, he regarded not who was wronged or who
suffered. In this case he hid himself even from his own bowels, and
cared not that his own children should lack even the necessaries of
life, provided he could increase his own store! How watchful should we
be against this destructive, unnatural, and degrading vice! It is
impossible for a man who loves money to love either God or man; and
consequently he must be in the broad way that leads to destruction.

For the difficulties in the chronology of Jacob's sojourning in
Padan-aram, I beg leave to refer to the following remarks.

Remarks upon [Gen 31:38](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#038.md), etc.,
relative to the time spent by Jacob in the service of his father-in-law
Laban, in Mesopotamia; from Dr. Kennicott. "If every reading which
introduces but a single difficulty demands our attention, much greater
must that demand be when several difficulties are caused by any one
mistake, or any one mistranslation. Of this nature is the passage before
us, which therefore shall be here considered more fully, especially as I
have not already submitted to the learned any remarks upon this subject.
Jacob's age at the time of his going to Laban, has (till very lately)
been fixed, perhaps universally, at seventy-seven years. But I think it
has been shown by the learned Mr. Skinner, in an excellent dissertation,
(4th. 1765), that the number seventy-seven cannot here be right.

"Jacob was one hundred and thirty when he went down (with sixty-six
persons) into Egypt. Joseph had then been governor ten years; and when
made governor was thirty; therefore Jacob could not be more than ninety
at the birth of Joseph. Now, upon supposition that Jacob was
seventy-seven at going to Laban, and that he had no son till he was
eighty-five, and that he, with eleven sons, left Laban at ninety-seven,
there will follow these amongst other strange consequences which are
enumerated by Mr. Skinner page 11, etc.:

1\. Though Isaac and Esau married at forty, Jacob goes at seventy-seven
to look for a wife, and agrees to marry her seven years after.

2\. Issachar is born after the affair of the mandrakes, which Reuben
finds and brings home when he (Reuben) was about four years old; that
is, if Issachar was born before Joseph, agreeably to [Gen
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#018.md), [Gen
30:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#025.md).

3\. Judah begets Er at thirteen; for in the first of the following
tables Judah is born in Jacob's year eighty-eight, and Er in one hundred
and two.

4\. Er marries at nine, and is destroyed for profligacy. Er, born one
hundred and two, marries in one hundred and eleven. See also [Gen
38:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#007.md).

5\. Onan marries at eight; for Onan, born in one hundred and three,
marries in one hundred and eleven.

6\. Shelah, being grown at ten, ought to be married; for Shelah, born in
one hundred and four, is marriageable, but not married to Tamar in one
hundred and fourteen. See [Gen 38:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#014.md).

7\. Pharez kept from marrying while young, yet has a son at thirteen;
for Pharez, born in one hundred and fifteen, had two sons at going to
Egypt in one hundred and thirty.

8\. Esau goes to Ishmael and marries his daughter, after Jacob went to
Laban at seventy-seven; though Ishmael died when Jacob was sixty-three.

9\. If Jacob had no son till he was eighty-five, and if Joseph was born
when his father was ninety, then the eleven sons and Dinah were born in
five years.

Lastly, if Jacob had no son till eighty-five, and he went to Egypt at
one hundred and thirty, with sixty-six persons, only forty-five years
are allowed for his family; whereas the larger sum of sixty-five years
seems necessary for the births of so many children and grandchildren. On
this subject Le Clerc has pronounced, Hisce in rebus occurrunt nodi,
quos nemo hactenus solvit; neque porro, ut opinor, solvet. There are
difficulties here which have never been explained, and in my opinion
never can be explained. But upon the single principle of Mr. Skinner,
that Jacob went to Laban at fifty-seven, (instead of seventy-seven),
these difficulties are solved. And it only remains to wish that some
authority may be found to support this conjecture, thus strongly founded
on the exigentia loci. The common opinion is formed by reckoning back
from the age of Joseph, when governor of Egypt, to the time of his
birth, and from the twenty years which Jacob was with Laban. This
number, Mr. Skinner thinks, was originally forty; and I think that the
Hebrew text as it now stands confirms the conjecture, and furnishes the
very authority which is so much wanted.

"After Jacob had served Laban fourteen years for his two wives, where
was Jacob to reside? Esau was still living; and Jacob might well be
afraid of returning to him, till more years of absence had disarmed his
resentment; and had the death of Esau happened, Jacob would then have
been secure. But let us also remember that Isaac was still alive, and
that Esau had determined to kill Jacob whenever their father should die.
It would therefore be no wonder if Jacob should have desired to continue
longer in Haran. And to carry this point more effectually, he might
offer to take care of Laban's cattle, and to live in his neighborhood,
upon such terms of advantage to Laban as could not easily be withstood.
Lastly, when the good effects to Laban from this connection had been
experienced, without profit, nay with some losses, to Jacob, for twenty
years, Jacob might naturally grow tired of thus assisting Laban without
providing for his own growing family. Accordingly we find that Jacob
covenants with Laban for six years of more close attendance and service
in Laban's own house, for which the wages were expressly settled.
Agreeable to the preceding possibilities seems to have been the fact,
Jacob living in Haran forty years, and in this manner: -

14 years in Laban's house, a covenant servant for his wives. 20 in
Laban's neighborhood, as a friend. 6 in Laban's house, a covenant
servant for cattle. 40 "Now the twenty concurrent years of neighbourly
assistance, and the disjointed twenty of covenant service, seem both of
them distinguished in the history itself. For upon Laban's pursuit of
Jacob he mentions twenty years twice; which two sets of twenty, if
really different, make forty. Each mention of the twenty years is
introduced with the word זה zeh, which word, when repeated, is used by
way of distinction; as when we say, this and that, the one or the other.
Thus, [Exo 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#020.md) : So that the one
came not near the other. [Ecc 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#005.md) :
This hath more rest than the other. And with the two words at a great
distance, [Job 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#023.md) : One dieth; [Job
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#025.md); and another dieth, etc. So
here, in [Gen 31:38](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#038.md), Jacob says to
Laban, זה עשרים שנה אנכי עמך zeh esrim shanah anochi immach, during the
One set of twenty years I was with thee, etc.; meaning the time in which
he lived, not in Laban's house, but in his neighborhood; not as a
servant, but a friend; after he had served in Laban's house fourteen
years for his daughters, and before he served six years for his cattle.
But then, as to the other twenty, he tells Laban, at [Gen
31:41](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#041.md), varying the phrase very
remarkably זה לי עשרים שנה בביתך עבדתיך zeh li esrim shanah bebeithecha
abadticha, during the other twenty years (ל li) For Myself (for my own
benefit) In Thy House; I served thee fourteen years, and six years, etc.
And during this last period, though only six years, he charges Laban
with changing his wages ten times. So that Jacob insists upon having
well earned his wages through the twenty years when he served for hire;
but he makes a far greater merit of having, for another twenty years,
assisted him without wages, and even with some losses; and therefore,
with particular propriety, he reminds Laban of that set of twenty years
in the first place.

The following Tables, taken chiefly from Mr. Skinner, will greatly
elucidate the true chronology of Jacob:

Genesis 38.(57-71 = 14 years' service; 72-91 = 20 years' assistance)

"Our translation now is, [Gen 31:38](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#038.md) :
This Twenty Years Have I Been With Thee; thy ewes and thy she-goats have
not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten. [Gen
31:39](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#039.md). That which was torn of beasts I
brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou
require it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night. [Gen
31:40](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#040.md). Thus I was; in the day the
drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from
mine eyes. [Gen 31:41](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#041.md). Thus Have I
Been Twenty Years In Thy House: I served thee fourteen years for thy two
daughters, and six years for thy cattle; and thou hast changed my wages
ten times.

"The alteration here recommended is this, [Gen
31:38](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#038.md) : During The One Twenty Years I
Was With Thee; thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young, and
the rams, etc., etc. [Gen 31:41](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#041.md).
During The Other Twenty Years For Myself, In Thy House, I served, etc.
The same distinction is expressed in [Gen
30:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#029.md) : Thou knowest how I have served
thee, and how thy cattle was with me; i.e., how I behaved during the
time I was with thee as thy servant, and how thy cattle fared during the
time they were with me as thy friend.

"It must not be omitted that Archbishop Usher and Bishop Lloyd ascribe
sons to Jacob very soon after his coming to Laban; nay, assert that he
was married almost as soon as he came to Haran, instead of waiting seven
years, as he most evidently did. And Mr. Jackson allows that some of the
sons of Benjamin, who are expressly numbered as going into Egypt with
Jacob, might be born in Egypt! From such distresses, and such
contradictions, does the distinction of two sets of twenty years happily
deliver us,"

Hoc temporis intervallo nemo concipere

poterit tot res contingere potuisse.

Spinosa.

In such a short space of time, it is impossible

that so many transactions could have taken place.

I shall leave this subject with chronologers and critics, and shall not
attempt to decide on either opinion. That of Dr. Kennicott I think the
most likely, and to it I have adapted the chronology in those cases to
which it relates; but there are difficulties in both cases. See Clarke
on [Gen 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#001) (note.md).
