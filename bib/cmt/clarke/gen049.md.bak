[Genesis 49:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 49:1</span></span>

That which shall befall you in the last days - It is evident from this,
and indeed from the whole complexion of these important prophecies, that
the twelve sons of Jacob had very little concern in them, personally
considered, as they were to be fulfilled in the last days, i. e., in
times remote from that period, and consequently to their posterity, and
not to themselves, or to their immediate families. The whole of these
prophetic declarations, from Genesis 49:2-27 inclusive, is delivered in
strongly figurative language, and in the poetic form, which, in every
translation, should be preserved as nearly as possible, rendering the
version line for line with the original. This order I shall pursue in
the succeeding notes, always proposing the verse first, in as literal a
translation as possible, line for line with the Hebrew after the
hemistich form, from which the sense will more readily appear; but to
the Hebrew text and the common version the reader is ultimately
referred.

2\. Come together and hear, O sons of Jacob! And hearken unto Israel
your father.

Bishop Newton has justly observed that Jacob had received a double
blessing, spiritual and temporal; the promise of being progenitor of the
Messiah, and the promise of the land of Canaan. The promised land he
might divide among his children as he pleased, but the other must be
confined to one of his sons; he therefore assigns to each son a portion
in the land of Canaan, but limits the descent of the blessed seed to the
tribe of Judah. Some have put themselves to a great deal of trouble and
learned labor to show that it was a general opinion of the ancients that
the soul, a short time previous to its departure from the body, becomes
endued with a certain measure of the prophetic gift or foresight; and
that this was probably the case with Jacob. But it would be derogatory
to the dignity of the prophecies delivered in this chapter, to suppose
that they came by any other means than direct inspiration, as to their
main matter, though certain circumstances appear to be left to the
patriarch himself, in which he might express his own feelings both as a
father and as a judge. This is strikingly evident, 1. In the case of
Reuben, from whom he had received the grossest insult, however the
passage relative to him may be understood; and, 2. In the case of
Joseph, the tenderly beloved son of his most beloved wife Rachel, in the
prophecy concerning whom he gives full vent to all those tender and
affectionate emotions which, as a father and a husband, do him endless
credit.

3\. Reuben, my first-born art thou! My might, and the prime of my
strength, Excelling in eminence, and excelling in power:

4\. Pouring out like the waters: - thou shalt not excel, For thou
wentest up to the bed of thy father, - Then thou didst defile: to my
couch he went up!

[Genesis 49:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 49:3</span></span>

Reuben as the first-born had a right to a double portion of all that the
father had; see [Deu 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#017.md)

The eminence or dignity mentioned here may refer to the priesthood; the
power, to the regal government or kingdom - In this sense it has been
understood by all the ancient Targumists. The Targum of Onkelos
paraphrases it thus: "Thou shouldst have received three portions, the
birthright, the priesthood, and the kingdom:" and to this the Targums of
Jonathan ben Uzziel and Jerusalem add: "But because thou hast sinned,
the birthright is given to Joseph, the kingdom to Judah, and the
priesthood to Levi." That the birthright was given to the sons of Joseph
we have the fullest proof from [Ch1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#001.md).

[Genesis 49:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 49:4</span></span>

Pouring out like the waters - This is an obscure sentence because
unfinished. It evidently relates to the defilement of his father's
couch; and the word פחז pachaz, here translated pouring out, and in our
Version unstable, has a bad meaning in other places of the Scripture,
being applied to dissolute, debauched, and licentious conduct. See [Jdg
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#004.md); [Zep
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#004.md); [Jer
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#014.md), [Jer
23:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#032.md); [Jer
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#023.md).

Thou shalt not excel - This tribe never rose to any eminence in Israel;
was not so numerous by one third as either Judah, Joseph, or Dan, when
Moses took the sum of them in the wilderness, [Num
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#021.md); and was among the first that
were carried into captivity, [Ch1
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#026.md).

Then thou didst defile - Another unfinished sentence, similar to the
former, and upon the same subject, passing over a transaction covertly,
which delicacy forbade Jacob to enlarge on. For the crime of Reuben, see
Clarke on [Gen 35:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#022) (note.md).

5\. Simeon and Levi, brethren: They have accomplished their fraudulent
purposes.

6\. Into their secret council my soul did not come; In their confederacy
my honor was not united: For in their anger they slew a man, (איש ish, a
noble), And in their pleasure they murdered a prince.

7\. Cursed was their anger, for it was fierce! And their excessive
wrath, for it was inflexible! I will divide them out in Jacob, And I
will disperse them in Israel.

[Genesis 49:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 49:5</span></span>

Simeon and Levi are brethren - Not only springing from the same parents,
but they have the same kind or disposition, head-strong, deceitful,
vindictive, and cruel.

They have accomplished, etc. - Our margin has it, Their swords are
weapons of violence, i. e., Their swords, which they should have used in
defense of their persons or the honorable protection of their families,
they have employed in the base and dastardly murder of an innocent
people.

The Septuagint gives a different turn to this line from our translation,
and confirms the translation given above: Συνετελεσαν αδικια εξαιρεσεως
αυτων· They have accomplished the iniquity of their purpose; with which
the Samaritan Version agrees. In the Samaritan text we read calu, they
have accomplished, instead of the Hebrew כלי keley, weapons or
instruments, which reading most critics prefer: and as to מכרתיהם
mecherotheyhem, translated above their fraudulent purposes, and which
our translation on almost no authority renders their habitations, it
must either come from the Ethiopic מכר macar, he counselled, devised
stratagems, etc., (see Castel), or from the Arabic macara, he deceived,
practiced deceit, plotted, etc., which is nearly of the same import.
This gives not only a consistent but evidently the true sense.

[Genesis 49:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 49:6</span></span>

Into their secret council, etc. - Jacob here exculpates himself from all
participation in the guilt of Simeon and Levi in the murder of the
Shechemites. He most solemnly declares that he knew nothing of the
confederacy by which it was executed, nor of the secret council in which
it was plotted.

If it should be said that the words תבא tabo and תחד techad should be
translated in the future tense or in the imperative, as in our
translation, I shall not contend; though it is well known that the
preterite is often used for the future in Hebrew, and vice versa. Taken
thus, the words mark the strong detestation which this holy man's soul
felt for the villany of his sons: "My soul shall not come into their
secret council. My honor shall not be united to their confederacy.

For in their anger they slew a man - איש ish, a noble, an honorable man,
viz., Shechem.

And in their pleasure - This marks the highest degree of wickedness and
settled malice, they were delighted with their deed. A similar spirit
Saul of Tarsus possessed previously to his conversion; speaking of the
martyrdom of St. Stephen, St. Luke says, [Act
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#001.md) : Σαυλος δε ην συνευδοκων τῃ
αναιρεσει αυτου· And Saul was gladly consenting to his death. He was
with the others highly delighted with it; and thus the prediction of our
Lord was fulfilled, [Joh 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#002.md) : Yea,
the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God
service. And it is represented as the highest pitch of profligacy and
wickedness, not only to sin, but to delight in it; see [Rom
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#032.md). As the original word רצון ratson
signifies, in general, pleasure, benevolence, delight, etc., it should
neither be translated self-will nor willfulness, as some have done, but
simply as above; and the reasons appear sufficiently obvious. They
murdered a prince - Hamor, the father of Shechem. Instead of שור shor,
which we have translated a wall, and others an ox, I read שר sar, a
prince, which makes a consistent sense; (see Kennicott's first
Dissertation, p. 56, etc.); as there is no evidence whatever that Simeon
and Levi either dug down a wall or houghed the oxen, as some have
translated the passage; Or houghed oxen; on the contrary, the text, [Gen
34:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#028.md), [Gen
34:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#029.md), proves that they had taken for
their own use the sheep, oxen, asses, all their wealth, their wives, and
their little ones.

[Genesis 49:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 49:7</span></span>

Cursed was their anger - The first motions of their violence were
savage; and their excessive or overflowing wrath, עברה ebrah, for it was
inflexible - neither the supplications of the males, nor the entreaties,
tears, cries, and shrieks of the helpless females, could deter them from
their murderous purpose; for this, [Gen
49:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#005.md), they are said to have
accomplished.

I will divide them out, אחלקם achallekem, I will make them into lots,
giving a portion of them to one tribe, and a portion to another; but
they shall never attain to any political consequence. This appears to
have been literally fulfilled. Levi had no inheritance except
forty-eight cities, scattered through different parts of the land of
Canaan: and as to the tribe of Simeon, it is generally believed among
the Jews that they became schoolmasters to the other tribes; and when
they entered Canaan they had only a small portion, a few towns and
villages in the worst part of Judah's lot, [Jos
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#001.md), which afterwards finding too
little, they formed different colonies in districts which they conquered
from the Idumeans and Amalekites, [Ch1
4:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#039.md), etc. Thus these two tribes were
not only separated from each other, but even divided from themselves,
according to this prediction of Jacob.

8\. Judah! thou! Thy brethren shall praise thee. Thy hand, in the neck
of thine enemies: The sons of thy father shall bow themselves to thee.

9\. A lion's whelp is Judah: From the prey, my son, thou hast ascended,
He couched, lying down like a strong lion And like a lioness; who shall
arouse him?

10\. From Judah the scepter shall not depart, Nor a teacher from his
offspring, Until that Shiloh shall come, And to him shall be assembled
the peoples.

11\. Binding his colt to the vine, And to the choice vine the foals of
his ass, He washed his garments in wine, His clothes in the blood of the
grape.

12\. With wine shall his eyes be red, And his teeth shall be white with
milk.

[Genesis 49:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 49:8</span></span>

Thy brethren shall praise thee - As the name Judah signifies praise,
Jacob takes occasion from its meaning to show that this tribe should be
so eminent and glorious, that the rest of the tribes should praise it;
that is, they should acknowledge its superior dignity, as in its
privileges it should be distinguished beyond all the others. On the
prophecy relative to Judah, Dr. Hales has several judicious remarks, and
has left very little to be farther desired on the subject. Every reader
will be glad to meet with them here.

"The prophecy begins with his name Judah, signifying the praise of the
Lord, which was given to him at his birth by his mother Leah, [Gen
29:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#035.md). It then describes the warlike
character of this tribe, to which, by the Divine appointment, was
assigned the first lot of the promised land, which was conquered
accordingly by the pious and heroic Caleb; the first who laid hands on
the necks of his enemies, and routed and subdued them, [Jos
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#011.md); 15;1; [Jdg
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001.md), [Jdg
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#002.md); and led the way for their total
subjugation under David; who, in allusion to this prediction, praises
God, and says: Thou hast given me the necks of mine enemies, that I
might destroy them that hate me, [Psa
18:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#040.md). In the different stages of its
strength, this tribe is compared to a lion's whelp, to a full grown
lion, and to a nursing lioness, the fiercest of all. Hence a lion was
the standard of Judah; compare [Num
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#003.md), [Eze
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#010.md). The city of David, where he
reposed himself after his conquests, secure in the terror of his name,
[Ch1 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#017.md), was called Ariel, the lion
of God, [Isa 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001.md); and our Lord
himself, his most illustrious descendant, the Lion of the tribe of
Judah, [Rev 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#005.md).

"The duration of the power of this famous tribe is next determined: 'the
scepter of dominion,' as it is understood [Est
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#004.md); [Isa
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#005.md), etc., or its civil government,
was not to cease or depart from Judah until the birth or coming of
Shiloh, signifying the Apostle, as Christ is styled, [Heb
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001.md); nor was the native lawgiver, or
expounder of the law, teacher, or scribe, intimating their
ecclesiastical polity, to cease, until Shiloh should have a congregation
of peoples, or religious followers, attached to him. And how accurately
was this fulfilled in both these respects!

"1. Shortly before the birth of Christ a decree was issued by Augustus
Caesar that all the land of Judea and Galilee should be enrolled, or a
registry of persons taken, in which Christ was included, [Luk
2:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001.md); whence Julian the apostate
unwittingly objected to his title of Christ or King, that he was born a
subject of Caesar!' About eleven years after Judea was made a Roman
province, attached to Syria on the deposal and banishment of Archelaus,
the son of Herod the Great, for maladministration; and an assessment of
properties or taxing was carried into effect by Cyrenius, then governor
of Syria, the same who before, as the emperor's procurator, had made the
enrolment, [Luk 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#002.md); [Act
5:37](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#037.md); and thenceforth Judea was
governed by a Roman deputy, and the judicial power of life and death
taken away from the Jews, [Joh 18:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#031.md).

"2. Their ecclesiastical polity ceased with the destruction of their
city and temple by the Romans, a. d. 70; at which time the Gospel had
been preached through the known world by the apostles, 'his witnesses in
Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost
parts of the earth;' [Act 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#008.md); [Rom
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#018.md).

"Our Lord's triumphant entry into Jerusalem, before his crucifixion,
'riding on an ass, even a colt the foal of an ass,' which by his
direction his disciples brought to him for this purpose, 'Go into the
village over against you, and presently ye shall find an ass tied, and a
colt with her; loose them, and bring them to me,' [Mat
21:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#002.md), remarkably fulfilling the
prophecy of Zechariah, ([Zac 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009).md) is
no less a fulfillment of this prophecy of Shiloh, 'binding or tying his
foal to the vine, even his ass's colt to the choice vine.' In ancient
times to ride upon white asses or ass-colts was the privilege of persons
of high rank, princes, judges, and prophets, [Jdg
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#010.md); [Jdg
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#004.md); [Num
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#022.md). And as the children of Israel
were symbolized by the vine, [Psa
80:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#008.md); [Hos
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#001.md), and the men of Judah by 'a
(choice) vine of Sorek,' in the original, both here and in the beautiful
allegory of Isaiah, [Isa 5:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001.md),
adopted by Jeremiah, [Jer 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#021.md), and by
our Lord, [Mat 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033.md), who styled
himself the true vine, [Joh 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001.md); so
the union of both these images signified our Lord's assumption, as the
promised Shiloh, of the dignity of the king of the Jews, not in a
temporal but in a spiritual sense, as he declared to Pilate, [Joh
18:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#036.md), as a prelude to his second
coming in glory 'to restore again the kingdom to Israel.'

"The vengeance to be then inflicted on all the enemies of his Church, or
congregation of faithful Christians, is expressed by the symbolical
imagery of 'washing his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood
of grapes;' which to understand literally, would be incongruous and
unusual any where, while it aptly represents his garments crimsoned in
the blood of his foes, and their immense slaughter; and imagery
frequently adopted in the prophetic scriptures.

"The strength and wholesomeness of Shiloh's doctrine are next
represented by having 'his eyes red with wine, and his teeth white with
milk.' And thus the evangelical prophet, in similar strains, invites the
world to embrace the Gospel: -

Ho, every one that thirsteth, come to the waters, And he that hath no
money; come, buy and eat: Yea, come, buy wine and milk, Without money
and without price. [Isa 55:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001.md).

"On the last day of the feast of tabernacles it was customary among the
Jews for the people to bring water from the fountain of Siloah or
Siloam, which they poured on the altar, singing the words of Isaiah,
[Isa 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#003.md) : With joy shall ye draw
water from the fountain of salvation; which the Targum interprets, 'With
joy shall ye receive a new doctrine from the Elect of the Just One;' and
the feast itself was also called Hosannah, Save, we beseech thee. And
Isaiah has also described the apostasy of the Jews from their tutelar
God Immanuel, under the corresponding imagery of their 'rejecting the
gently-flowing waters of Siloah,' [Isa
8:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#006.md).

"Hence our Lord, on the last day of the feast, significantly invited the
Jews to come unto him as the true and living Fountain of waters, [Jer
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#013.md). 'If any man thirst, let him come
to Me and drink;' [Joh 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037.md). He also
compared his doctrine to new wine, which required to be put into new
bottles, made of skins strong enough to contain it, [Mat
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#017.md); while the Gospel is repeatedly
represented as affording milk for babes, or the first principles of the
oracles of God for novices in the faith, as well as strong meat \[and
strong wine\] for masters in Christ or adepts, [Mat
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#011.md); [Heb
5:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#012.md).

"And our Lord's most significant miracle was wrought at this fountain,
when he gave sight to a man forty years old, who had been blind from his
birth, by sending him, after he had anointed his eyes with moistened
clay, to wash in the pool of Siloam, which is the Greek pronunciation of
the Hebrew שלה Siloah or Siloh, [Isa
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#006.md), where the Septuagint version
reads Σιλωαμ, signifying, according to the evangelist, απεσταλμενος,
sent forth, and consequently derived from שלח shalach, to send, [Joh
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#007.md). Our Lord thus assuming to himself
his two leading titles of Messiah, signifying anointed, and Shiloh, sent
forth or delegated from God; as he had done before at the opening of his
mission: 'The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me
to preach the Gospel to the poor; he hath sent me forth (απεσταλκε) to
heal the broken-hearted,' etc.; [Luk
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018.md).

"And in the course of it he declared, I was not sent forth (απεσταλην)
but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel, [Mat
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#024.md), by a two-fold reference to his
character in Jacob's prophecy of Shiloh and Shepherd Of Israel, [Gen
49:10-24](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md). 'This is life eternal, to
know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou sentest forth,'
(απεστειλας), to instruct and save mankind, [Joh
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003.md); and he thus distinguishes his
own superior mission from his commission to his apostles: 'As The Father
hath sent Me, (απεσταλκε με), so I send you,' πεμπω ὑμας, [Joh
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#021.md). Whence St. Paul expressly
styles Jesus Christ 'the Apostle (Ὁ Αποστολος) and High Priest of our
profession,' [Heb 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001.md); and by an
elaborate argument shows the superiority of his mission above that of
Moses, and of his priesthood above that of Aaron, in the sequel of the
epistle. His priesthood was foretold by David to be a royal priesthood,
after the order of Melchizedek, [Psa
110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004.md). But where shall we find his
mission or apostleship foretold, except in Jacob's prophecy of Shiloh?
which was evidently so understood by Moses when God offered to send him
as his ambassador to Pharaoh, and he declined at first the arduous
mission: 'O my Lord, send I pray thee by the hand of Him whom thou wilt
send,' or by the promised Shiloh, [Exo
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#010.md); [Exo
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#013.md); by whom in his last blessing to
the Israelites, parallel to that of Jacob, he prayed that 'God would
bring back Judah to his people,' from captivity, [Deu
33:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#007.md). "Here then we find the true
meaning and derivation of the much disputed term Shiloh in this prophecy
of Jacob, which is fortunately preserved by the Vulgate, rendering qui
mittendus est, he that is to be sent, and also by a rabbinical comment
on [Deu 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#007.md) : 'If you keep this
precept, you hasten the coming of the Messiah, who is called Sent.'
"This important prophecy concerning Judah intimates, 1. The warlike
character and conquests of this tribe; 2. The cessation of their civil
and religious polity at the first coming of Shiloh; 3. His meek and
lowly inauguration at that time, as spiritual King of the Jews, riding
on an ass like the ancient judges and prophets; 4. His second coming as
a warrior to trample on all his foes; and, 5. To save and instruct his
faithful people." - Hales' Anal., vol. ii., p. 167, etc.

[Genesis 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 49:10</span></span>

From Judah the scepter shall not depart - The Jews have a quibble on the
word שבט shebet, which we translate scepter; they say it signifies a
staff or rod, and that the meaning of it is, that "afflictions shall not
depart from the Jews till the Messiah comes;" that they are still under
affliction and therefore the Messiah is not come. This is a miserable
shift to save a lost cause. Their chief Targumist, Onkelos, understood
and translated the word nearly as we do; and the same meaning is adopted
by the Jerusalem Targum, and by all the ancient versions, the Arabic
excepted, which has kazeeb, a rod; but in a very ancient MS. of the
Pentateuch in my own possession the word sebet is used, which signifies
a tribe. Judah shall continue a distinct tribe till the Messiah shall
come; and it did so; and after his coming it was confounded with the
others, so that all distinction has been ever since lost.

Nor a teacher from his offspring - I am sufficiently aware that the
literal meaning of the original מבין רגליו mibbeyn raglaiv is from
between his feet, and I am as fully satisfied that it should never be so
translated; from between the feet and out of the thigh simply mean
progeny, natural offspring, for reasons which surely need not be
mentioned. The Targum of Jonathan ben Uzziel, and the Jerusalem Targum,
apply the whole of this prophecy, in a variety of very minute
particulars, to the Messiah, and give no kind of countenance to the
fictions of the modern Jews.

13\. At the haven of the seas shall Zebulun dwell, And he shall be a
haven for ships.And his border shall extend unto Sidon.

[Genesis 49:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 49:13</span></span>

Zebulun's lot or portion in the division of the Promised Land extended
from the Mediterranean Sea on the west, to the lake of Gennesareth on
the east; see his division, [Jos
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#010.md), etc. The Targum of Jonathan ben
Uzziel paraphrases the passage thus: "Zebulun shall be on the coasts of
the sea, and he shall rule over the havens; he shall subdue the
provinces of the sea with his, ships, and his border shall extend unto
Sidon.

14\. Issachar is a strong ass Couching between two burdens.

15\. And he saw the resting place that it was good, And the land that it
was pleasant; And he inclined his shoulder to the load, And he became a
servant unto tribute.

[Genesis 49:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 49:14</span></span>

Issachar is a strong ass - חמר גרם chamor garem is properly a
strong-limbed ass; couching between two burdens - bearing patiently, as
most understand it, the fatigues of agriculture, and submitting to
exorbitant taxes rather that exert themselves to drive out the old
inhabitants.

The two burdens literally mean the two sacks or panniers, one on each
side of the animal's body; and couching down between these refers to the
well-known propensity of the ass, whenever wearied or overloaded, to lie
down even with its burden on its back.

[Genesis 49:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 49:15</span></span>

He saw that rest - The inland portion that was assigned to him between
the other tribes. He inclined his shoulder to the load; the Chaldee
paraphrase gives this a widely different turn to that given it by most
commentators: "He saw his portion that it was good, and the land that it
was fruitful; and he shall subdue the provinces of the people, and drive
out their inhabitants, and those who are left shall be his servants, and
his tributaries." Grotius understands it nearly in the same way. The
pusillanimity which is generally attributed to this tribe certainly does
not agree with the view in which they are exhibited in Scripture. In the
song of Deborah this tribe is praised for the powerful assistance which
it then afforded, [Jdg 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#015.md). And in
[Ch1 7:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#001.md), they are expressly said to
have been valiant men of might in all their families, and in all their
generations; i. e., through every period of their history. It appears
they were a laborious, hardy, valiant tribe, patient in labor and
invincible in war; bearing both these burdens with great constancy
whenever it was necessary. When Tola of this tribe judged Israel, the
land had rest twenty-three years, [Jdg
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#001.md).

16\. Dan shall judge his people, As one of the tribes of Israel.

17\. Dan shall be a serpent on the way, A cerastes upon the track,
Biting the heels of the horse, And his rider shall fall backwards.

[Genesis 49:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 49:16</span></span>

Dan shall judge - Dan, whose name signifies judgment, was the eldest of
Jacob's sons by Bilhah, Rachel's maid, and he is here promised an equal
rule with those tribes that sprang from either Leah or Rachel, the legal
wives of Jacob. Some Jewish and some Christian writers understand this
prophecy of Samson, who sprang from this tribe, and judged, or as the
word might be translated avenged, the people of Israel twenty years. See
[Jdg 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#002.md); [Jdg
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#020.md).

[Genesis 49:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 49:17</span></span>

Dan shall be a serpent - The original word is נחש nachash, and we have
seen on Genesis 3 that this has a great variety of significations. It is
probable that a serpent is here intended, but of what kind we know not;
yet as the principal reference in the text is to guile, cunning, etc.,
the same creature may be intended as in Genesis 3.

A cerastes upon the track - The word שפיפון shephiphon, which is nowhere
else to be found in the Bible, is thus translated by the Vulgate, and
Bochart approves of the translation. The cerastes has its name from two
little horns upon its head, and is remarkable for the property here
ascribed to the shephiphon. The word ארח orach, which we translate path,
signifies the track or rut made in the ground by the wheel of a cart,
wagon, etc. And the description that Nicander gives of this serpent in
his Theriaca perfectly agrees with what is here said of the shephiphon.

εν δ' αμαθοισιν

Η και ἁματροχιῃσι παρα στιβον ενδυκες ανει.

v\. 262.

It lies under the sand, or in some cart rut by the way.

It is intimated that this tribe should gain the principal part of its
conquests more by cunning and stratagem, than by valor; and this is seen
particularly in their conquest of Laish, Judges 18, and even in some of
the transactions of Samson, such as burning the corn of the Philistines,
and at last pulling down their temple, and destroying three thousand at
one time, see [Jdg 16:26-30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#026.md).

18\. For thy salvation have I waited, O Lord!

This is a remarkable ejaculation, and seems to stand perfectly
unconnected with all that went before and all that follows; though it is
probable that certain prophetic views which Jacob now had, and which he
does not explain, gave rise to it; and by this he at once expressed both
his faith and hope in God. Both Jewish and Christian commentators have
endeavored to find out the connection in which these words existed in
the mind of the patriarch. The Targum of Jonathan expresses the whole
thus: "When Jacob saw Gideon the son of Joash, and Samson the son of
Manoah, which were to be saviors in a future age, he said: I do not wait
for the salvation of Gideon, I do not expect the salvation of Samson,
because their salvation is a temporal salvation; but I wait for and
expect thy salvation, O Lord, because thy salvation is eternal." And the
Jerusalem Targum much to the same purpose: "Our father Jacob said: Wait
not, my soul, for the redemption of Gideon the son of Joash which is
temporal, nor the redemption of Samson which is a created salvation; but
for the salvation which thou hast said by Thy Word should come to thy
people the children of Israel: my soul waits for this thy salvation."
Indeed these Targums understand almost the whole of these prophecies of
the Messiah, and especially what is said about Judah, every word of
which they refer to him. Thus the ancient Jews convict the moderns of
both false interpretations and vain expectations. As the tribe of Dan
was the first that appears to have been seduced from the true worship of
God, (see [Jdg 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#030).md), some have
thought that Jacob refers particularly to this, and sees the end of the
general apostasy only in the redemption by Jesus Christ, considering the
nachash above as the seducer, and the Messiah the promised seed.

19\. Gad, an army shall attack him, And he shall attack in return.

This is one of the most obscure prophecies in the whole chapter; and no
two interpreters agree in the translation of the original words, which
exhibit a most singular alliteration: - גד גדוד יגודנו gad gedud
yegudennu; והוא יגד עקב vehu yagud akeb.

The prophecy seems to refer generally to the frequent disturbances to
which this tribe should be exposed, and their hostile, warlike
disposition, that would always lead them to repel every aggression. It
is likely that the prophecy had an especial fulfillment when this tribe,
in conjunction with that of Reuben and the half tribe of Manasseh, got a
great victory over the Hagarites, taking captive one hundred thousand
men, two thousand asses, fifty thousand camels, and two hundred and
fifty thousand sheep; see [Ch1
5:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#018.md). Dr. Durell and others
translate the last word עקב akeb, rear - "He shall invade their rear;"
which contains almost no meaning, as it only seems to state that though
the army that invaded Gad should be successful, yet the Gadites would
harass their rear as they returned: but this could never be a subject
sufficient consequence for a prophecy. The word עיב d ekeb is frequently
used as a particle, signifying in consequence, because of, on account
of. After the Gadites had obtained the victory above mentioned, they
continued to possess the land of their enemies till they were carried
away captive. The Chaldee paraphrasts apply this to the Gadites going
armed over Jordan before their brethren, discomfiting their enemies, and
returning back with much spoil. See [Jos
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#012.md), [Jos
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#013.md), and [Jos
22:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#001.md), [Jos
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#008.md).

20\. From Asher his bread shall be fat, And he shall produce royal
dainties.

This refers to the great fertility of the lot that fell to Asher, and
which appears to have corresponded with the name, which signifies happy
or blessed. His great prosperity is described by Moses in this
figurative way: "Let Asher be blessed with children, let him be
acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil;" [Deu
33:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#024.md).

21\. Naphtali is a spreading oak, Producing beautiful branches.

This is Bochart's translation; and perhaps no man who understands the
genius of the Hebrew language will attempt to dispute its propriety; it
is as literal as it is correct. Our own translation scarcely gives any
sense. The fruitfulness of this tribe in children may be here intended.
From his four sons Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem, which he took down
into Egypt, [Gen 46:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#024.md), in the course
of two hundred and fifteen years there sprang of effective men 53,400:
but as great increase in this way was not an uncommon case in the
descendants of Jacob, this may refer particularly to the fruitfulness of
their soil, and the especial providential care and blessing of the
Almighty; to which indeed Moses seems particularly to refer, [Deu
33:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#023.md) : O Naphtali, satisfied with
favor, and full with the blessing of the Lord. So that he may be
represented under the notion of a tree planted in a rich soil, growing
to a prodigious size, extending its branches in all directions, and
becoming a shade for men and cattle, and a harbour for the fowls of
heaven.

22\. The son of a fruitful (vine) is Joseph; The son of a fruitful
(vine) by the fountain: The daughters (branches) shoot over the wall.

23\. They sorely afflicted him and contended with him; The chief archers
had him in hatred.

24\. But his bow remained in strength, And the arms of his hands were
made strong By the hand of the Mighty One of Jacob: By the name of the
Shepherd, the Rock of Israel.

25\. By the God of thy father, for he helped thee; And God
All-sufficient, he blessed thee, The blessing of the heavens from above,
And the blessings lying in the deep beneath, The blessings of the
breasts and of the womb

26\. The blessings of thy father have prevailed Over the blessings of
the eternal mountains, And the desirable things of the everlasting
hills. These shall be on the head of Joseph, And on his crown who was
separated from his brethren.

[Genesis 49:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 49:22</span></span>

The sum of a fruitful vine - This appears to me to refer to Jacob
himself, who was blessed with such a numerous posterity that in two
hundred and fifteen years after this his own descendants amounted to
upwards of 600,000 effective men; and the figures here are intended to
point out the continual growth and increase of his posterity. Jacob was
a fruitful tree planted by a fountain, which because it was good would
yield good fruit; and because it was planted near a fountain, from being
continually watered, would be perpetually fruitful. The same is used and
applied to Jacob, [Deu 33:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#028.md) : The
Fountain Of Jacob shall be upon a land of corn, and wine, etc.

The daughters, בנות banoth, put here for branches, shoot over or run
upon the wall - Alluding probably to the case of the vine, which
requires to be supported by a wall, trees, etc. Some commentators have
understood this literally, and have applied it to the Egyptian women,
who were so struck with the beauty of Joseph as to get upon walls, the
tops of houses, etc., to see him as he passed by. This is agreeable to
the view taken of the subject by the Koran. See Clarke on [Gen
39:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#006) (note.md).

[Genesis 49:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">gen 49:23</span></span>

The chief archers - בעלי חצים baaley chitstsim, the masters of arrows -
Joseph's brethren, who either used such weapons, while feeding their
flocks in the deserts, for the protection of themselves and cattle, or
for the purpose of hunting; and who probably excelled in archery. It may
however refer to the bitter speeches and harsh words that they spoke to
and of him, for they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him,
[Gen 37:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#004.md). Thus they sorely afflicted
him, and were incessantly scolding or finding fault.

[Genesis 49:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gen 49:24</span></span>

But his bow remained in strength - The more he was persecuted, either by
his brethren or in Egypt, the more resplendent his uprightness and
virtues shone: and the arms his extended power and influence, of his
hands plans, designs, and particular operations of his prudence,
judgment, discretion, etc., were all rendered successful by the hand -
the powerful succor and protection, of the Mighty One of Jacob that God
who blessed and protected all the counsels and plans of Jacob, and
protected and increased him also when he was in a strange land, and
often under the power of those who sought opportunities to oppress and
defraud him.

By the name of the Shepherd; the Rock of Israel - Jehovah, and El-Elohey
Israel; see [Gen 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#020.md). This appears
to me to refer to the subject of the thirty-second chapter, where Jacob
wrestled with God, had God's name revealed to him, and his own name
changed from Jacob to Israel, in consequence of which he built an altar,
and dedicated it to God, who had appeared to him under the name of
Elohey-Israel, the strong God of Israel; which circumstance led him to
use the term Rock, which, as an emblem of power, is frequently given to
God in the sacred writings, and may here refer to the stone which Jacob
set up. It is very probable that the word shepherd is intended to apply
to our blessed Lord, who is the Shepherd of Israel, the good Shepherd,
[Joh 10:11-17](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#011.md); and who, beyond all
controversy, was the person with whom Jacob wrestled. See Clarke on [Gen
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#007) (note.md) and [Gen
32:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#024) (note.md).

[Genesis 49:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">gen 49:25</span></span>

The God of thy father - How frequently God is called the God of Jacob
none needs be told who reads the Bible.

God All-sufficient - Instead of את שדי Eth Shaddai, The Almighty or
All-sufficient; I read אל שדי El Shaddai, God All-sufficient; which is
the reading of the Samaritan, Septuagint, Syriac, and Coptic, and of
three reputable MSS. In the collections of Kennicott and De Rossi. The
copies used by those ancient versions had evidently אל El, God, and not
את eth, The, a mistake produced in later times. On the word אל שדי El
Shaddai, See Clarke on [Gen 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#001.md)
(note).

The blessing of the heavens from above - A generally pure, clear, serene
sky, frequently dropping down fertilizing showers and dews, so as to
make a very fruitful soil and salubrious atmosphere.

Blessings lying in the deep beneath - Whatever riches could be gained
from the sea or rivers, from mines and minerals in the bowels of the
earth, and from abundant springs in different parts of his inheritance.
Our translation of this line is excessively obscure: Blessings of the
deep that lieth under. What is it that lies under the deep: By
connecting ברכת bircoth, blessings, with רבצת robetseth, lying, all
ambiguity is avoided, and the text speaks a plain and consistent sense.

The blessings of the breasts and of the womb - A numerous offspring, and
an abundance of cattle. The progeny of Joseph, by Ephraim and Manasseh,
amounted at the first census or enumeration (Numbers 1). to 75,900 men,
which exceeded the sum of any one tribe; Judah, the greatest of the
others, amounting to no more than 74,600. Indeed, Ephraim and Manasseh
had multiplied so greatly in the days of Joshua, that a common lot was
not sufficient for them. See their complaint, [Jos
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#014.md).

[Genesis 49:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gen 49:26</span></span>

The blessing of thy father, etc. - The blessings which thy father now
prays for and pronounces are neither temporal nor transitory; they shall
exceed in their duration the eternal mountains, and in their value and
spiritual nature all the conveniences, comforts, and delicacies which
the everlasting hills can produce. They shall last when the heavens and
the earth are no more, and shall extend throughout eternity. They are
the blessings which shall be communicated to the world by means of the
Messiah.

The Jerusalem Targum paraphrases the place thus: "The blessing of this
father shall be added unto the blessings wherewith thy fathers Abraham
and Isaac, who are likened to mountains, have blessed thee; and they
shall exceed the blessings of the four mothers, Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel,
and Leah, who are likened to the hills: all these blessings shall be a
crown of magnificence on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the
head of him who was a prince and governor in the land of Egypt."

27\. Benjamin is a ravenous wolf: In the morning he shall devour the
prey, And in the evening he shall divide the spoil.

This tribe is very fitly compared to a ravenous wolf, because of the
rude courage and ferocity which they have invariably displayed,
particularly in their war with the other tribes, in which they killed
more men than the whole of their own numbers amounted to.

"This last tribe," says Dr. Hales, "is compared to a wolf for its
ferocious and martial disposition, such as was evinced by their contests
with the other tribes, in which, after two victories, they were almost
exterminated, Judges 19, 20." Its union with the tribe of Judah seems to
be intimated in their joint conquests, expressed nearly in the same
terms: "Judah went up from the prey;" "Benjamin devoured the prey."
Moses in his parallel prophecy, [Deu
33:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#012.md), confirms this by signifying
that the sanctuary should be fixed in his lot, and that he should
continue as long as the existence of the temple itself: -

The Beloved Of The Lord shall dwell with him in safety,

And shall cover him all the day long,

And shall dwell between his shoulders.

[Deu 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#012.md).

In the morning, etc. - These expressions have been variously understood.
The sense given above is that in which the principal interpreters agree;
but Houbigant protests against the prophecy signifying the continuance
of this tribe, as the words, "in the morning devouring the prey," and
"in the evening dividing the spoil," are supposed to imply; "because,"
he observes, "after the return from the Babylonish captivity, this tribe
is no more mentioned." But this may be accounted for from the
circumstance of its being associated with that of Judah, (see [Kg1
12:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#021).md), after which it is scarcely
ever mentioned but in that union. Being thus absorbed in the tribe of
Judah, it continued from the morning till the evening of the Jewish
dispensation, and consequently till the Lion of the tribe of Judah was
seen in the wilderness of Israel. In the morning, according to Mr.
Ainsworth, "signifies the first times; for Ehud of Benjamin was the
second judge that saved the Israelites from the hands of the Moabites,
[Jdg 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#015.md), etc. Saul of Benjamin was
the first king of Israel; he and his son were great warriors, making a
prey of many enemies, [Sa1 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#006.md), [Sa1
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#007.md), [Sa1
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#011.md); [Sa1
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#013.md), [Sa1
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#015.md), [Sa1
14:47](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#047.md), [Sa1
14:48](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#048.md). And the evening, the latter
times; for Mordecai and Esther of Benjamin delivered the Jews from a
great destruction, and slew their enemies, [Est
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#007.md), [Est
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#009.md), [Est
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#011.md); [Est
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#005.md), [Est
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#006.md), [Est
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#015.md), [Est
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#016.md)."

[Genesis 49:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">gen 49:28</span></span>

Every one according to his blessing - That is, guided by the unerring
Spirit of prophecy, Jacob now foretold to each of his sons all the
important events which should take place during their successive
generations, and the predominant characteristic of each tribe; and, at
the same time, made some comparatively obscure references to the advent
of the Messiah, and the redemption of the world by him.

[Genesis 49:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 49:29</span></span>

Bury me with my fathers, etc. - From this it appears that the cave at
Machpelah was a common burying-place for Hebrews of distinction; and
indeed the first public burying-place mentioned in history. From [Gen
49:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#031.md) we find that Abraham, Sarah,
Isaac, Rebekah, and Leah, had been already deposited there, and among
them Jacob wished to have his bones laid; and he left his dying charge
with his children to bury him in this place, and this they
conscientiously performed. See [Gen
50:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#013.md).

[Genesis 49:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">gen 49:33</span></span>

He gathered up his feet into the bed - It is very probable that while
delivering these prophetic blessings Jacob sat upon the side of his bed,
leaning upon his staff; and having finished, he lifted up his feet into
the bed, stretched himself upon it, and expired!

And was gathered unto his people - The testimony that this place bears
to the immortality of the soul, and to its existence separate from the
body, should not be lightly regarded. In the same moment in which Jacob
is said to have gathered up his feet into the bed, and to have expired,
it is added, and was gathered unto his people. It is certain that his
body was not then gathered to his people, nor till seven weeks after;
and it is not likely that a circumstance, so distant in point both of
time and place, would have been thus anticipated, and associated with
facts that took place in that moment. I cannot help therefore
considering this an additional evidence for the immateriality of the
soul, and that it was intended by the Holy Spirit to convey this grand
and consolatory sentiment, that when a holy man ceases to live among his
fellows, his soul becomes an inhabitant of another world, and is joined
to the spirits of just men made perfect.

1\. It has been conjectured (See Clarke [Gen
37:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#009) (note).md) that the eleven stars
that bowed down to Joseph might probably refer to the signs of the
Zodiac, which were very anciently known in Egypt, and are supposed to
have had their origin in Chaldea. On this supposition Joseph's eleven
brethren answered to eleven of these signs, and himself to the twelfth.
General Vallancy has endeavored, in his Collectanea de Rebus Hibernicis,
vol. vi., part. ii., p. 343, to trace out the analogy between the twelve
sons of Jacob and the twelve signs of the Zodiac, which Dr. Hales
(Analysis, vol. ii., p. 165) has altered a little, and placed in a form
in which it becomes more generally applicable. As this scheme is
curious, many readers who may not have the opportunity of consulting the
above works will be pleased to find it here. That there is an allusion
to the twelve signs of the Zodiac, and probably to their ancient
asterisms, may be readily credited; but how far the peculiar
characteristics of the sons of Jacob were expressed by the animals in
the Zodiac, is a widely different question.

1\. Reuben - "Unstable (rather pouring out) as waters" - the sign
Aquarius, represented as a man pouring out waters from an urn.

2\. Simeon and Levi - "The united brethren" the sign Gemini or the
Twins.

3\. Judah - "The strong lion" - the sign Leo.

4\. Asher - "His bread shall be fat" - the sign Virgo or the Virgin,
generally represented as holding a full ear of corn.

5\. Issachar - "A strong ass" or ox, both used in husbandry - the sign
Taurus or the Bull.

6\. and

7\. Dan - "A serpent biting the horse's heels" - Scorpio, the Scorpion.
On the celestial sphere the Scorpion is actually represented as biting
the heel of the horse of the archer Sagittarius; and Chelae, "his
claws," originally occupied the space of Libra.

8\. Joseph - "His bow remained in strength" - the sign Sagittarius, the
archer or bowman; commonly represented, even on the Asiatic Zodiacs,
with his bow bent, and the arrow drawn up to the head - the bow in full
strength.

9\. Naphtali - by a play on his name, טלה taleh, the ram - the sign
Aries, according to the rabbins.

10\. Zebulun - "A haven for ships" - denoted by Cancer, the crab.

11\. Gad - "A troop or army" - reversed, dag, a fish - the sign Pisces.

12\. Benjamin - "A ravening wolf" - Capricorn, which on the Egyptian
sphere was represented by a goat led by Pan, with a wolf's head.

What likelihood the reader may see in all this, I cannot pretend to say;
but that the twelve signs were at that time known in Egypt and Chaldea,
there can be little doubt.

2\. We have now seen the life of Jacob brought to a close; and have
carefully traced it through all its various fortunes, as the facts
presented themselves in the preceding chapters. Isaac his father was
what might properly be called a good man; but in strength of mind he
appears to have fallen far short of his father Abraham, and his son
Jacob. Having left the management of his domestic concerns to Rebekah
his wife, who was an artful and comparatively irreligious woman, the
education of his sons was either neglected or perverted. The unhappy
influence which the precepts and example of his mother had on the mind
of her son we have seen and deplored. Through the mercy of God Jacob
outlived the shady part of his own character, and his last days were his
brightest and his best. He had many troubles and difficulties in life,
under which an inferior mind must have necessarily sunk; but being a
worker together with the providence of God, his difficulties only served
in general to whet his invention, and draw out the immense resources of
his own mind. He had to do with an avaricious, procrastinating relative,
as destitute of humanity as he was of justice. Let this plead something
in his excuse. He certainly did outwit his father-in-law; and yet,
probably, had no more than the just recompense of his faithful services
in the successful issue of all his devices. From the time in which God
favored him with that wonderful manifestation of grace at Peniel,
Genesis 32, he became a new man. He had frequent discoveries of God
before, to encourage him in journeys, secular affairs, etc.; but none in
which the heart-changing power of Divine grace was so abundantly
revealed. Happy he whose last days are his best! We can scarcely
conceive a scene more noble or dignified than that exhibited at the
deathbed of Jacob. This great man was now one hundred and forty-seven
years of age; though his body, by the waste of time, was greatly
enfeebled, yet with a mind in perfect vigor, and a hope full of
immortality, he calls his numerous family together, all of them in their
utmost state of prosperity, and gives them his last counsels, and his
dying blessing. His declarations show that the secret of the Lord was
with him, and that his candle shone bright upon his tabernacle. Having
finished his work, with perfect possession of all his faculties, and
being determined that while he was able to help himself none should be
called in to assist, (which was one of the grand characteristics of his
life), he, with that dignity which became a great man and a man of God
stretched himself upon his bed, and rather appears to have conquered
death than to have suffered it. Who, seeing the end of this illustrious
patriarch, can help exclaiming, There is none like the God of Jeshurun!
Let Jacob's God be my God! Let me die the death of the righteous, and
let my last end be like his! Reader, God is still the same: and though
he may not make thee as great as was Jacob, yet he is ready to make thee
as good; and, whatever thy past life may have been, to crown thee with
loving-kindness and tender mercies, that thy end also may be peace.
