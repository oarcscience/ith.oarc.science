### [Amos Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#001.md)

[Amos](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">amo 5:0</span></span>

This chapter opens with a tender and pathetic lamentation, in the style
of a funeral song, over the house of Israel, [Amo
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#001.md), [Amo
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#002.md). The prophet then glances at the
awful threatening denounced against them, [Amo
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#003.md); earnestly exhorting them to
renounce their idols, and seek Jehovah, of whom he gives a very
magnificent description, [Amo 5:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#004.md).
He then reproves their injustice and oppression with great warmth and
indignation; exhorts them again to repentance; and enforces his
exhortation with the most awful threatenings, delivered with great
majesty and authority, and in images full of beauty and grandeur, [Amo
5:10-24](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#010.md). The chapter concludes with
observing that their idolatry was of long standing, that they increased
the national guilt, by adding to the sins of their fathers; and that
their punishment, therefore, should be great in proportion, [Amo
5:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#025.md). Formerly numbers of them were
brought captive to Damascus, [Kg2
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#032.md), [Kg2
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#033.md); but now they must go beyond it
to Assyria, [Kg2 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029.md); [Kg2
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006.md).

[Amos 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 5:1</span></span>

Hear ye this word - Attend to this doleful song which I make for the
house of Israel.

[Amos 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">amo 5:2</span></span>

The virgin of Israel - The kingdom of Israel, or the ten tribes, which
were carried into captivity; and are now totally lost in the nations of
the earth.

[Amos 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">amo 5:3</span></span>

The city that went out by a thousand - The city that could easily have
furnished, on any emergency, a thousand fighting men, can now produce
scarcely one hundred - one in ten of the former number; and now of the
hundred scarcely ten remain: so reduced was Israel when Shalmaneser
besieged and took Samaria, and carried the residue into captivity.

[Amos 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">amo 5:4</span></span>

Seek ye me, and ye shall live - Cease your rebellion against me; return
to me with all your heart; and though consigned to death, ye shall be
rescued and live. Deplorable as your case is, it is not utterly
desperate.

[Amos 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">amo 5:5</span></span>

But seek not Beth-el - There was one of Jeroboam's golden calves, and at
Gilgal were carved images; both were places in which idolatry was
triumphant. The prophet shows them that all hope from those quarters is
utterly vain; for Gilgal shall go into captivity, and Beth-el be brought
to naught. There is a play or paronomasia on the letters and words in
this clause: הגלגל גלה יגלה ובית אל יהיה לאון haggilgal galoh yigleh,
ubeith el yiheyeh leaven. "This Gilgal shall go captive into captivity;
and Beth-el (the house of God) shall be for Beth-aven," (the house of
iniquity.)

[Amos 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">amo 5:6</span></span>

Seek the Lord, and ye shall live - Repeated from [Amo
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#004.md).

In the house of Joseph - The Israelites of the ten tribes, of whom
Ephraim and Manasseh, sons of Joseph, were the chief.

[Amos 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">amo 5:7</span></span>

Ye who turn judgment to wormwood - Who pervert judgment; causing him who
obtains his suit to mourn sorely over the expenses he has incurred in
gaining his right.

[Amos 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">amo 5:8</span></span>

That maketh the seven stars and Orion - Or, Hyades and Arcturus, Kimah
and Kesil. See my notes on [Job 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#009.md);
[Job 38:32](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#032.md), where the subject of this
verse is largely considered.

Turneth the shadow of death into the morning - Who makes day and night,
light and darkness.

Calleth for the waters of the sea - Raising them up by evaporation, and
collecting them into clouds.

And poureth them out - Causing them to drop down in showers upon the
face of the earth. Who has done this? Jehovah is his name.

[Amos 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">amo 5:9</span></span>

That strengtheneth the spoiled - Who takes the part of the poor and
oppressed against the oppressor; and, in the course of his providence,
sets up the former, and depresses the latter.

[Amos 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">amo 5:10</span></span>

They hate him that rebuketh in the gate - They cannot bear an upright
magistrate, and will not have righteous laws executed.

[Amos 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">amo 5:11</span></span>

Your treading is upon the poor - You tread them under your feet; they
form the road on which ye walk; and yet it was by oppressing and
impoverishing them that ye gained your riches.

Ye take from him burdens of wheat - Ye will have his bread for doing him
justice.

[Amos 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">amo 5:12</span></span>

I know your manifold transgressions - I have marked the multitude of
your smaller crimes, as well as your mighty offenses. Among their
greater offenses were,

1\. Their afflicting the righteous.

2\. Taking bribes to blind their eyes in judgment. And,

3\. Refusing to hear the poor, who had no money to give them.

[Amos 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">amo 5:13</span></span>

The prudent shall keep silence - A wise man will consider that it is
useless to complain. He can have no justice without bribes; and he has
no money to give: consequently, in such an evil time, it is best to keep
silence.

[Amos 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">amo 5:14</span></span>

Seek good, and not evil - Is there a greater mystery in the world, than
that a mall, instead of seeking good, will seek evil, knowing that it is
evil?

And so the Lord - As God is the Fountain of good, so they who seek the
supreme good seek him: and they who seek shall find him; For the Lord,
the God of hosts, shall be with him.

[Amos 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">amo 5:15</span></span>

Hate the evil, and love the good - What ruins you, avoid; what helps
you, cleave to. And as a proof that you take this advice, purify the
seats of justice, and then expect God to be gracious to the remnant of
Joseph - to the posterity of the ten tribes.

[Amos 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">amo 5:16</span></span>

They shall call the husbandman to mourning - Because the crops have
failed, and the ground has been tilled in vain.

Such as are skillful of lamentation - See the note on [Jer
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#017.md).

[Amos 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">amo 5:17</span></span>

And in all vineyards shall be wailing - The places where festivity
especially used to prevail.

I will pass through thee - As I passed, by the ministry of the
destroying angel, through Egypt, not to spare, but to destroy.

[Amos 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">amo 5:18</span></span>

Wo unto you that desire the day of the Lord - The prophet had often
denounced the coming of God's day, that is, of a time of judgment; and
the unbelievers had said, "Let his day come, that we may see it." Now
the prophet tells them that that day would be to them darkness -
calamity, and not light - not prosperity.

[Amos 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">amo 5:19</span></span>

As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him - They shall go
from one evil to another. He who escapes from the lion's mouth shall
fall into the bear's paws: -

Incidit in Scyllam, cupiens vitare Charybdim.

The Israelites, under their king Menahem, wishing to avoid a civil war,
called in Pul, king of Assyria, to help them. This led to a series of
evils inflicted by the Syrian and Assyrian kings, till at last Israel
was ravaged by Shalmaneser, and carried into captivity. Thus, in
avoiding one evil they fell into another still more grievous.

Leaned his hands on a wall, and a serpent bit him - Snakes and venomous
animals are fond of taking up their lodging in walls of houses, where
they can either find or make holes; and it is dangerous to sit near them
or lean against them. In the East Indies they keep the faithful mongose,
a species of ichneumon, in their houses, for the purpose of destroying
the snakes that infest them.

[Amos 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">amo 5:21</span></span>

I hate, I despise your feast days - I abominate those sacrificial
festivals where there is no piety, and I despise them because they
pretend to be what they are not. This may refer to the three annual
festivals which were still observed in a certain way among the
Israelites.

[Amos 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">amo 5:22</span></span>

The peace-offerings of your fat beasts - מריאיכם merieychem probably
means buffaloes; and so Bochart.

[Amos 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">amo 5:23</span></span>

The noise of thy songs - the melody of thy viols - They had both vocal
and instrumental music in those sacrificial festivals; and God hated the
noise of the one and shut his ears against the melody of the other. In
the first there was nothing but noise, because their hearts were not
right with God; and in the latter there could be nothing but (זמרת
zimrath) cutting and scraping, because there was no heart - no religious
sense in the thing, and nearly as little in them that used it. See on
[Amo 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#005) (note.md).

[Amos 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">amo 5:24</span></span>

Let judgment run down - Let the execution of justice be everywhere like
the showers that fall upon the land to render it fertile; and let
righteousness in heart and life be like a mighty river, or the Jordan,
that shall wind its course through the whole nation, and carry every
abomination into the Dead Sea. Let justice and righteousness prevail
everywhere, and sweep their contraries out of the land.

[Amos 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">amo 5:25</span></span>

Have ye offered unto me sacrifices - Some have been led to think that
"during the forty years which the Israelites spent in the wilderness,
between Egypt and the promised land, they did not offer any sacrifices,
as in their circumstances it was impossible; they offered none because
they had none." But such people must have forgotten that when the
covenant was made at Sinai, there were burnt-offerings and
peace-offerings of oxen sacrificed to the Lord, [Exo
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#005.md); and at the setting up of the
tabernacle the twelve princes of the twelve tribes offered each a young
bullock, a ram, and a lamb, for a burnt-offering; a kid for a
sin-offering; two oxen, five rams, five he-goats, and five lambs, for a
peace-offering, [Num 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#012.md), etc.; which
amounted to an immense number of victims offered in the course of the
twelve days during which this feast of the dedication lasted. At the
consecration of priests, bullocks and rams to a considerable number were
offered, see [Lev 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#001.md), etc.; but they
were not offered so regularly, nor in such abundance, as they were after
the settlement in the promised land. Learned men, therefore, have
considered this verse as speaking thus: Did ye offer to me, during forty
years in the wilderness, sacrifices in such a way as was pleasing to me?
Ye did not; for your hearts were divided, and ye were generally in a
spirit of insurrection or murmuring.

[Amos 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">amo 5:26</span></span>

But ye have borne - The preceding verse spoke of their fathers; the
present verse speaks of the Israelites then existing, who were so
grievously addicted to idolatry, that they not only worshipped at stated
public places the idols set up by public authority, but they carried
their gods about with them everywhere.

The tabernacle of your Moloch - Probably a small portable shrine, with
an image of their god in it, such as Moloch; and the star or
representative of their god Chiun. For an ample exposition of this
verse, see the note on [Act 7:42](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#042.md); to
which let me add, that from Picart's Religious Ceremonies, vol. 3 p.
199, we find that there was an idol named Choun worshipped among the
Peruvians from the remotest antiquity.

[Amos 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">amo 5:27</span></span>

Will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus - That is, into
Assyria, the way to which, from Judea, was by Damascus.

But St. Stephen says, [Act 7:43](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#043.md),
beyond Babylon; because the Holy Spirit that was in him chose to extend
the meaning of the original text to that great and final captivity of
the Jews in general, when Zedekiah, their last king, and the people of
Judea, were carried into Mesopotamia, Armenia, and Media; see [Kg2
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#007.md), [Kg2
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#024.md). This captivity happened after
the time of Amos.
