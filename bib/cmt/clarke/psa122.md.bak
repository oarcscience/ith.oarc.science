### [Psalms Chapter 122](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 122:0</span></span>

The satisfaction of a gracious soul in the use of God's ordinances, [Psa
122:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#001.md), [Psa
122:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#002.md). Description of the internal
governmentof Jerusalem, [Psa 122:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#003.md).
Prayers for its peace and prosperity, [Psa
122:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#006.md).

In the preceding Psalms we find the poor captives crying to God for
deliverance; here they are returning thanks that they find they are
permitted to return to their own land and to the ordinances of their
God.

[Psalms 122:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 122:1</span></span>

I was glad when they said - When Cyrus published an edict for their
return, the very first object of their thanksgiving was the kindness of
God in permitting them to return to his ordinances.

[Psalms 122:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 122:2</span></span>

Our feet shad stand - For seventy years we have been exiled from our own
land; our heart was in Jerusalem, but our feet were in Chaldea. Now God
has turned our captivity, and our feet shall shortly stand within the
gates of Jerusalem. What a transition from misery to happiness! and what
a subject for rejoicing!

[Psalms 122:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 122:3</span></span>

Jerusalem - compact together - It is now well rebuilt, every part
contributing to the strength of the whole. It is also a state of great
political and spiritual union. It is the center of union to all the
tribes, for each tribe has an equal interest in that God who is
worshipped there.

[Psalms 122:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 122:4</span></span>

The testimony of Israel - There is the ark, where the presence of God is
manifested; there is the holy of holies; and there all the tribes
assembled to worship Jehovah. He no doubt alludes to the assembling of
the tribes annually at each of the three grand national festivals.

[Psalms 122:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 122:5</span></span>

There are set thrones of judgment - There were the public courts, and
thither the people went to obtain justice; and while the thrones of the
house of David were there, they had justice.

[Psalms 122:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 122:6</span></span>

Pray for the peace of Jerusalem - שלום shalom signifies both peace and
prosperity. Let her unanimity never be disturbed; let her prosperity
ever be on the increase!

They shall prosper that love thee - In the peace and prosperity of the
city, they shall find their peace and their prosperity; and even on this
ground they should love the city, and labor to promote its best
interests. There is a remarkable alliteration in this verse, the letter
ש shin frequently recurring.

שאלו שלום ירושלם ישליו אהביך

Shaalu shelom yerushalam yishlayu ohabeycha.

"Ask ye the prosperity of Jerusalem; they shall be quiet that love
thee."

There are remarkable specimens of similar alliteration to be found in
all poets, ancient and modern. This formed the chief feature of our
ancient poetry. Thus in Peter the plouphman: -

"In a somers seysoun whan sete was the sonne

I schoop me in a shrowde as I a sheep were."

And the same manner often appears, even in Milton himself. See the II
Penseroso: -

"Oft, on a plat of rising ground,

I hear the far-off curfew sound

Over some wide-watered shore,

Swinging slow with sullen roar."

[Psalms 122:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 122:7</span></span>

Peace be within thy walls - This is the form of prayer that they are to
use: "May prosperity ever reside within thy walls, on all the people
that dwell there; and tranquillity within thy palaces or high places,
among the rulers and governors of the people."

[Psalms 122:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 122:8</span></span>

For any brethren and companions' sakes - Because this city is the abode
of my kinsfolk and countrymen, I will wish it prosperity. I will promote
its peace and tranquillity by all means in my power. I will
affectionately say, May peace be within thee!

[Psalms 122:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 122:9</span></span>

Because of the house of the Lord our God - Particularly will I wish thee
well, because thou art the seat of religion, the place where our
merciful God has condescended to dwell.

To the captives in Babylon the Prophet Jeremiah had given this charge,
[Jer 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#007.md) : "And seek שלום shalom, the
prosperity of the city, whither I have caused you to be carried
captives, and pray unto the Lord for it; for in the prosperity thereof
ye shall have prosperity."

Was this a duty for the captives? Yes. And is it the duty of every man
for his own country! God, nature, common sense, and self-interest say,
Yes! And what must we think of the wretches who not only do not thus
pray, but labor to destroy the public peace, to subvert the government
of their country, to raise seditions, and to destroy all its civil and
religious institutions? Think of them! Why, that hemp would be disgraced
by hanging them.

There is a fine picture given us here of the state of Jerusalem after
the restoration of the Jews. The walls were finished, the city rebuilt,
beautiful, strong, and regular, the temple and its worship were
restored, the courts of justice were re-established, the constituted
authorities in Church and state were doing their duty; and God was
pouring out his blessing upon all. Who could see this without praying,
May God increase thy peace, and establish thy prosperity for ever!
