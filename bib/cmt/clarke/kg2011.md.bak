[4 Kings (2 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg2 11:0</span></span>

Athaliah destroys all that remain of the seed royal of Judah, [Kg2
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#001.md). Jehosheba hides Joash the son of
Ahaziah, and he remains hidden in the house of the Lord six years; and
Athaliah reigns over the land, [Kg2
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#002.md), [Kg2
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#003.md). Jehoiada, the high priest, calls
the nobles privately together into the temple, shows them the kings son,
takes an oath of them, arms them, places guards around the temple, and
around the young king's person; they anoint and proclaim him, [Kg2
11:4-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#004.md). Athaliah is alarmed, comes
into the temple, is seized, carried forth, and slain, [Kg2
11:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#013.md). Jehoiada causes the people
to enter into a covenant with the Lord; they destroy Baal's house,
priest, and images, [Kg2 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#017.md), [Kg2
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#018.md). Joash is brought to the king's
house, reigns, and all the land rejoices, [Kg2
11:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#019.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 11:1</span></span>

Athaliah - This woman was the daughter of Ahab, and grand-daughter of
Omri, and wife of Joram king of Judah, and mother of Ahaziah.

Destroyed all the seed royal - All that she could lay her hands on whom
Jehu had left; in order that she might get undisturbed possession of the
kingdom.

How dreadful is the lust of reigning! it destroys all the charities of
life; and turns fathers, mothers, brothers, and children, into the most
ferocious savages! Who, that has it in his power, makes any conscience

"To swim to sovereign rule through seas of blood?"

In what a dreadful state is that land that is exposed to political
revolutions, and where the succession to the throne is not most
positively settled by the clearest and most decisive law! Reader, beware
of revolutions; there have been some useful ones, but they are in
general the heaviest curse of God.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 11:2</span></span>

Daughter of - Joram, sister of Ahaziah - It is not likely that Jehosheba
was the daughter of Athaliah; she was sister, we find, to Ahaziah the
son of Athaliah, but probably by a different mother. The mother of
Jehoash was Zibiah of Beer-sheba; see [Kg2
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#001.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 11:3</span></span>

He was - hid in the house of the Lord - This might be readily done,
because none had access to the temple but the priests; and the high
priest himself was the chief manager of this business.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 11:4</span></span>

And the seventh year Jehoiada sent - He had certainly sounded them all,
and brought them into the interests of the young king, before this time;
the plot having been laid, and now ripe for execution, he brings the
chief officers of the army and those of the body guard into the temple,
and there binds them by an oath of secrecy, and shows them the king's
son, in whose behalf they are to rise.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 11:5</span></span>

That enter in on the Sabbath - It appears that Jehoiada chose the
Sabbath day to proclaim the young king, because as that was a day of
public concourse, the gathering together of the people who were in this
secret would not be noticed; and it is likely that they all came
unarmed, and were supplied by Jehoiada with the spears and shields which
David had laid up in the temple, [Kg2
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#010.md).

The priests and Levites were divided into twenty-four classes by David,
and each served a week by turns in the temple, and it was on the Sabbath
that they began the weekly service, all this favored Jehoiada's design.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 11:10</span></span>

King David's spears and shields - Josephus expressly says that David had
provided an arsenal for the temple, out of which Jehoiada took those
arms. His words are; Ανοιξας δε Ιωαδος την εν τῳ ἱερῳ ὁπλοθηκην, ἡν
Δαβιδης κατεσκευασε, διεμερισε τοις ἑκατονταρχαις ἁμα και ἱεροισι και
Λευιταις ἁπανθ' ὁσα εὑρεν εν αυτῃ δορατα τε και φαρετρας, και ει τι
ἑτερον ειδος ὁπλου κατελαβε. "And Jehoiada having opened the arsenal in
the temple, which David had prepared, he divided among the centurions,
priests, and Levites, the spears, (arrows), and quivers, and all other
kinds of weapons which he found there." - Ant. lib. ix., c. 7, s. 8.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 11:12</span></span>

Put the crown upon him - This was a diadem or golden band that went
round the head.

And - the testimony - Probably the book of the law, written on a roll of
vellum. This was his scepter. Some think that it was placed upon his
head, as well as the diadem. The diadem, the testimony, and the
anointing oil, were essential to his consecration.

They clapped their hands - This I believe is the first instance on
record of clapping the hands as a testimony of joy.

God save the king - יחי המלך yechi hannmelech; May the king live! So the
words should be translated wherever they occur.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 11:14</span></span>

The king stood by a pillar - Stood On a pillar or tribunal; the place or
throne on which they were accustomed to put the kings when they
proclaimed them.

Treason, Treason - קשר קשר kesher, kasher; A conspiracy, A conspiracy!
from kashar, to bind, unite together.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 11:15</span></span>

Have her forth - She had pressed in among the guards into the temple.

And him that followeth - The person who takes her part, let him
instantly be slain.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 11:16</span></span>

By the way - which the horses came - They probably brought her out near
the king's stables. It has been supposed, from [Eze
46:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#001.md), [Eze
46:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#002.md), that the east gate of the inner
court was that by which the king entered on the Sabbath day, whereas on
all other days he entered by the south gate.

And there was another gate, called the horse gate, in the wall of the
city, ([Jer 31:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#040).md), for the king's
horses to go out at from the stables at Millo, which is therefore
called, [Ch2 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#015.md), the horse gate
toward the king's house.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 11:17</span></span>

Jehoiada made a covenant - A general covenant was first made between the
Lord, the Supreme King, the king his viceroy, and the people, that they
should all be the Lord's people; each being equally bound to live
according to the Divine law.

Then, secondly, a particular covenant was made between the king and the
people, by which the king was bound to rule according to the laws and
constitution of the kingdom, and to watch and live for the safety of the
public. And the people were bound on their part, to love, honor, succor,
and obey the king. Where these mutual and just agreements are made and
maintained, there can be nothing else than prosperity in the Church and
the state.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 11:18</span></span>

His altars and images brake they in pieces - It is probable that
Athaliah had set up the worship of Baal in Judah, as Jezebel had done in
Israel; or probably it had never been removed since the days of Solomon.
It was no wonder that Jehoiada began his reform with this act, when we
learn from [Ch2 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#007.md), that the sons of
Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also
all the dedicated things of the house of the Lord did they bestow upon
Baalim.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 11:20</span></span>

The people - rejoiced - They were glad to get rid of the tyranny of
Athaliah.

And the city was in quiet - She had no partisans to rise up and disturb
the king's reign.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 11:21</span></span>

Seven years old was Jehoash - The first instance on record of making a
child seven years old the king of any nation, and especially of such a
nation as the Jews, who were at all times very difficult to be governed.
