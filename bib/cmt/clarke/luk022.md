### [Luke Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#001)

[Luke](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">luk 22:0</span></span>

The chief priests and scribes plot our Lord's destruction, [Luk
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#001), [Luk
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#002). Judas, at the instigation of the
devil, betrays him, [Luk 22:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#003). He
eats his last supper with his disciples, [Luk
22:7-18](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#007). Institutes the eucharist,
[Luk 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#019), [Luk
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#020). Announces one of his disciples
as the traitor, [Luk 22:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#021) : The
contention which should be greatest, [Luk
22:24-30](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#024). Warns Peter against Satan's
devices, [Luk 22:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#031), [Luk
22:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#032). Peter's resolution, [Luk
22:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#033). His denial foretold, [Luk
22:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#034). Tells his disciples to make
prudent provision for their own support, [Luk
22:35-37](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#035). The two swords, [Luk
22:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#038). He goes to the Mount of Olives,
and has his agony in the garden, [Luk
22:39-46](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#039). Judas comes with a mob, [Luk
22:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#047), [Luk
22:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#048). Peter cuts off the ear of the
high priest's servant, which Christ heals by a touch, [Luk
22:49-51](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#049). He addresses the chief
priests and captains of the temple, [Luk
22:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#052), [Luk
22:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#053). They lead him to the high
priest's house, and Peter follows and denies his Master, [Luk
22:54-60](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#054). Christ looks upon him, he is
stung with remorse, and weeps bitterly, [Luk
22:61](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#061), [Luk
22:62](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#062). Jesus is mocked, and variously
insulted, [Luk 22:63-65](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#063). The next
morning he is questioned before the council, [Luk
22:66](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#066), [Luk
22:67](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#067). He acknowledges himself to be
the Son of God, [Luk 22:68-70](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#068). They
condemn him, [Luk 22:71](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#071).

[Luke 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 22:1</span></span>

The feast of unleavened bread, etc. - See this largely explained, [Exo
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#014) (note); Leviticus 23:2-40
(note), and on [Mat 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#002) (note).

[Luke 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 22:2</span></span>

They feared the people - The great mass of the people seem to have been
convinced that Christ was at least a prophet sent from God; and it is
likely they kept steady in their attachment to him. The multitude, who
are represented as clamouring for his blood at the crucifixion, appear
to have been a mere mob, formed out of the creatures of the chief
priests and Pharisees.

[Luke 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 22:3</span></span>

Then entered Satan into Judas - The devil filled the heart of Judas with
avarice; and that infamous passion led him to commit the crime here
specified. This at once accounts for the whole of this most unprincipled
and unnatural transaction. None but a devil, or he who is possessed by
one, could have been guilty of it: - let the living lay this to heart. A
minister of the Gospel, who is a lover of money, is constantly betraying
the interests of Christ. He cannot serve two masters; and while his
heart is possessed with the love of self, the love of God and zeal for
perishing souls cannot dwell in him. What Satan could not do by the envy
and malice of the high priests and Pharisees, he effects by Judas, a
false and fallen minister of the Gospel of God. None are so dangerous to
the interests of Christianity as persons of this stamp.

[Luke 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 22:4</span></span>

And captains - Among the priests who were in waiting at the temple, some
were appointed φυλακες, for a guard to the temple; and over these were
Ϛρατηγοι commanding officers: both sorts are mentioned by Josephus, War,
b. vi. c. 5. s. 3. Bp. Pearce, See another sense of captains, in the
note on [Mat 27:65](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#065) (note). Dr.
Lightfoot supposes these to have been the captains over the watches; for
in three places the priests kept watch and ward in the temple, viz. in
Beth Abtenes, in Beth Nitsots, and in Beth Mokad. The Levites also in
twenty-one places more, Middoth, chap. i. Though these watches consisted
of several persons in each, there was one set over them, as the captain
or head of that watch. He thinks that Matthew, [Mat
27:65](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#065), refers to one of these: Ye have
a watch of your own; let some of them be sent to guard the sepulchre.
The captain of the temple, he supposes to have been the chief or head of
all these watches; and thus he was captain of the captains. In the same
Talmudical tract it is said, The ruler of the mountain of the temple
(i.e. captain of the temple) takes his walks through every watch with
torches lighted before him: if he found any upon the watch, that was not
standing on his feet, he said, Peace be with thee: but if he found him
sleeping, he struck him with a stick, and he might also burn his
clothes. And when it was said by others, What noise is that in the
court? the answer was, It is the noise of a Levite under correction,
whose garments they are burning, because he slept upon his watch. This
custom casts light on [Rev 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#015) :
Behold, I come as a thief: blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his
garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame. It is easy to
distinguish this captain of the mountain of the temple from the ruler of
the temple, or sagan: the former presided over the guards; the latter
over the whole service of the temple. We have them both distinguished,
[Act 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#001) : there is the captain of the
temple; and Annas, who was the sagan. See Lightfoot.

[Luke 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 22:5</span></span>

They - covenanted to give him money - Matthew says thirty pieces, or
staters, of silver, about 4. 10s. English, the common price of the
meanest slave. See the note on [Mat
26:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#015).

[Luke 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 22:6</span></span>

And he promised - That is, to do it - εξωμολογησε: or, He accepted the
proposal. See Wakefield.

[Luke 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 22:7</span></span>

The passover - Πασχα, [Luk 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#001), is
the name of the festival; το πασχα here is supposed to be the name of
that on which they feasted, viz. the sacrificed paschal lamb. But see
the notes on Matthew 26 (note), and especially the observations at the
end of that chapter, ([Mat 26:75](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#075)
(note)).

[Luke 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 22:8</span></span>

He sent Peter and John, etc. - See the subject of these verses largely
explained on [Mat 26:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#017) (note), and
[Mar 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#013), [Mar
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#015) (note).

[Luke 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 22:14</span></span>

And when the hour was come - That is, the evening. See [Mat
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#020), and [Mar
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#017).

[Luke 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 22:15</span></span>

With desire I have desired - A Hebraism for, I have desired most
earnestly. Our Lord's meaning seems to be, that, having purposed to
redeem a lost world by his blood, he ardently longed for the time in
which he was to offer himself up. Such love did the holy Jesus bear to
the human race. This eucharistic passover was celebrated once, by way of
anticipation, before the bloody sacrifice of the victim of salvation,
and before the deliverance it was appointed to commemorate; as the
figurative passover had been likewise once celebrated before the going
out of Egypt, and the deliverance of God's chosen people. Quesnel.

[Luke 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 22:16</span></span>

Until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God - That is, until that of
which the passover is a type is fulfilled in my death, through which the
kingdom of God, or of heaven, (See [Mat
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002)), shall be established among men.

[Luke 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 22:17</span></span>

He took the cup - This was not the sacramental cup, for that was taken
after supper, [Luk 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#020), but was the
cup which was ordinarily taken before supper.

Divide it among yourselves - Pass the cup from one to another; thus the
cup which Christ gave to the first person on his right hand continued to
be handed from one to another, till it came to the last person on his
left.

[Luke 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 22:18</span></span>

I will not drink of the fruit of the vine - That is, before the time of
another passover, the Holy Ghost shall descend, the Gospel of the
kingdom be established, and the sacramental supper shall take place of
the paschal lamb; for in a few hours his crucifixion was to take place.
See on [Mat 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#029) (note).

[Luke 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 22:19</span></span>

Took bread - See the nature and design of the Lord's Supper explained in
the notes on [Mat 26:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#026) (note).

This do in remembrance of me - That the Jews, in eating the passover,
did it to represent the sufferings of the Messiah, as evident from the
tract Pesachim, fol. 119, quoted by Schoettgen.

Why do we call this the great hallel? (i.e. the hymn composed of several
psalms, which they sung after the paschal supper). Ans. Because in it
these five things are contained:

1\. The exodus from Egypt.

2\. The dividing of the Red Sea.

3\. The promulgation of the law.

4\. The resurrection of the dead. And,

5\. The sufferings of the Messiah.

The first is referred to, [Psa 114:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#001),
When Israel went out of Egypt, etc.

The second in [Psa 114:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#003), The sea saw
it and fled.

The third in [Psa 114:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#004), The mountains
skipped like rams, etc.

The fourth in [Psa 116:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#009), I will walk
before the Lord in the land of the living.

The fifth in [Psa 115:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#001), Not unto us,
O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory; for thy mercy and thy
truth's sake. See the note on [Mat
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#030).

[Luke 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 22:20</span></span>

This cup is the new testament in my blood - Perhaps it might be better
to paraphrase the passage thus: This cup which is poured out for you,
signifies the blood of the new covenant, which is shortly to be ratified
in (or by) the shedding of my blood. Or, This cup is the new covenant,
poured out for you with my blood: - that is, the paschal sacrifice and
my sacrifice happen together. But see Kypke.

It does not appear that our Lord handed either the bread or the cup to
each person; he gave it to him who was next to him, and, by handing it
from one to another, they shared it among themselves, [Luk
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#017). In this respect the present
mode of administering the Lord's Supper is not strictly according to the
original institution.

[Luke 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 22:21</span></span>

The hand of him that betrayeth me, etc. - What can be desired more, says
Dr. Lightfoot, as a demonstration that Judas was present at the
eucharist? And, whereas the contrary is endeavored to be proved out of
John 13, nothing is made out of nothing; for there is not one syllable
throughout that whole chapter of the paschal supper, but of a supper
before the feast of the passover.

[Luke 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 22:22</span></span>

The Son of man goeth - That is, he is about to die, Απερχεσθαι,
οιχεσθαι, abire, going, going away, and departing, are used, by the best
Greek and Latin writers, for death and dying. See Rosenmuller.

[Luke 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 22:23</span></span>

They began to inquire among themselves - See the notes on [Mat
26:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#023), [Mat
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#024).

[Luke 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 22:24</span></span>

There was also a strife among them - There are two different instances
of this sort of contention or strife mentioned by the evangelists, each
of which was accompanied with very different circumstances; one by
Matthew, in [Mat 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#001), etc., by Mark,
[Mar 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#033), etc.; and by Luke, in [Luk
9:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#046), etc. That contention cannot have
been the same with this which is mentioned here. The other, related in
[Mat 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#020), etc., and [Mar
10:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#035), etc., must be what Luke
intended here to record; and this strife or contention was occasioned by
the request which Zebedee's wife made to our Lord in favor of her sons,
James and John; but, then, Luke has mentioned this very much out of the
order of time, it having happened while our Lord and his disciples were
on their way to Jerusalem: [Mat 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#017);
[Mar 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#032). See Bp. Pearce.

[Luke 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 22:25</span></span>

Are called benefactors - The very Greek word used by the evangelist,
ευεργεται, was the surname of some of the Ptolemies of Egypt; Ptolemy
Euergetes, i.e. the Benefactor. It was a custom among the ancient Romans
to distribute part of the lands which they had conquered on the
frontiers of the empire to their soldiers; those who enjoyed such lands
were called beneficiarii, beneficed persons; and the lands themselves
were termed beneficia, benefices, as being held on the beneficence of
the sovereign; and it is no wonder that such sovereigns, however
tyrannical or oppressive they might have been in other respects, were
termed benefactors by those who were thus dependent on their bounty.

[Luke 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 22:26</span></span>

Let him be as the younger - Dr. Lightfoot justly conjectures that Peter
was the eldest of all the disciples; and he supposes that the strife was
kindled between him and the sons of Zebedee, James and John. These three
disciples were those whom Christ had distinguished by peculiar marks of
his favor; and therefore it is natural to conclude that the strife lay
between these three, the two brothers and Peter. Shall we or Peter be at
the head? Neither, says our Lord. Let him, Peter, who is chief (ὁ
μειζων, the eldest) among you, be as, John, ὁ νεωτερος, the younger. The
younger part of the disciples do not appear to have taken any part in
this contention; and our Lord shows Peter, and the sons of Zebedee, that
they must be as unambitious as the younger in order to be acknowledged
as his disciples. Dr. Lightfoot thinks that Peter was the mover of this
strife, and therefore our Lord rebukes him by name.

[Luke 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 22:29</span></span>

I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me - The
Codex Alexandrinus, with some other MSS., the later Syriac, and Origen,
read in the first clause, διαθηκην, a covenant. I appoint unto you a
Covenant, as my Father hath appointed unto me a kingdom: - Ye shall be
ministers of the new covenant, as I am king in that spiritual kingdom to
which it relates. This is a curious reading: but our Lord is probably to
be understood as promising that they should get a kingdom - a state of
blessedness, as he should get it - they must go through much tribulation
in order to enter into the kingdom of God. So the Son of man suffered
that he might enter into his glory: for the joy that was set before him,
he endured the cross, and despised the shame, and is set down on the
right hand of God.

[Luke 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">luk 22:30</span></span>

Sit on thrones - See on [Mat 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028)
(note). Marcion left the whole of this verse out, according to
Epiphanius: probably because he did not understand it.

[Luke 22:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 22:31</span></span>

Simon, Simon - When a name is thus repeated in the sacred writings, it
appears to be always intended as an expression of love, manifested by a
warning voice. As if he had said, While thou and the others are
contending for supremacy, Satan is endeavoring to destroy you all: but I
have prayed for thee, as being in most danger.

Satan hath desired - you - That is, all the apostles, but particularly
the three contenders: the plural pronoun, ὑμας, sufficiently proves that
these words were not addressed to Peter alone. Satan had already got
one, Judas; he had nearly got another, Peter; and he wished to have all.
But we see by this that the devil cannot even tempt a man unless he
receive permission. He desires to do all evil; he is permitted only to
do some.

[Luke 22:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">luk 22:32</span></span>

I have prayed for thee - From the natural forwardness and impetuosity of
thy own spirit, thou wilt be brought into the most imminent danger; but
I have supplicated for thee, that thy faith may not utterly fail -
εκλειπῃ, from εκ, out, and λειπω, I fail, to fall utterly or entirely
off. Peter's faith did fail, but not utterly: he did fall, but he did
not fall off, apostatize, or forsake his Master and his cause finally,
as Judas did. Every body sees, from Peter's denial of his Lord, that his
faith did fail, and his great courage too; and yet they read, in the
common translation, that Christ prayed that it might not fail: can they
then conceive that our Lord's prayer was heard? The translation which I
have given above removes this embarrassment and apparent contradiction.
It was certainly Peter's advantage that our Lord did pray for him; but
it was not so much for his honor that he should stand in need of such a
prayer, beyond all others. Lightfoot.

When thou art converted - Restored to a sense of thy folly and sin, and
to me and my cause - establish these thy brethren. All the disciples
forsook Jesus and fled, merely through fear of losing their lives;
Peter, who continued for a while near him, denied his Master with oaths,
and repeated this thrice: our Lord seems to intimate that, after this
fall, Peter would become more cautious and circumspect than ever; and
that he should become uncommonly strong in the faith, which was the
case; and that, notwithstanding the baseness of his past conduct, he
should be a proper instrument for strengthening the feeble minded, and
supporting the weak. His two epistles to the persecuted Christians show
how well he was qualified for this important work.

[Luke 22:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 22:34</span></span>

The cock shall not crow this day - [Mat
26:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#034), and [Mar
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#030), say, this night; both
expressions are right, because the Jewish day, of twenty-four hours,
began with the evening, and ended at the evening of the following day.
On Peter's denial, see the notes on [Mat
26:31-35](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#031) (note).

[Luke 22:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">luk 22:35</span></span>

When I sent you without purse - See the notes on [Mat
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#009), [Mat
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#010).

[Luke 22:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 22:36</span></span>

He that hath no sword - Bishop Pearce supposes that the word μαχαιραν,
sword, has been inserted here from what is said in [Luk
22:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#038), as it is evident our Lord never
intended to make any resistance, or to suffer a sword to be used on the
occasion; see [Mat 26:52](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#052). The word
stands rather oddly in the passage: the verse, translated in the order
in which it stands, is as follows: And he who hath none, let him sell
his garment and buy - a sword. Now it is plain that the verb πωλησατω,
let him buy, may be referred to πηραν a scrip, in the former part of the
verse: therefore if, according to the bishop's opinion, the word sword
be omitted, the passage may be understood thus: "When I sent you out
before, [Luk 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001), etc., I intended
you to continue itinerants only for a few days, and to preach the Gospel
only to your country-men; therefore you had but little need of a staff,
purse, or scrip, as your journey was neither long, nor expensive; but
now I am about to send you into all the world, to preach the Gospel to
every creature; and, as ye shall be generally hated and persecuted for
my sake, ye shall have need to make every prudent provision for your
journey; and so necessary will it be for you to provide yourselves
victuals, etc., for your passage through your inhospitable country,
that, if any of you have no scrip or wallet, he should sell even his
upper garment to provide one." Others, who are for retaining the word
sword, think that it was a proverbial expression, intimating a time of
great difficulty and danger, and that now the disciples had need to look
to themselves, for his murderers were at hand. The reader will observe
that these words were spoken to the disciples just before he went to the
garden of Gethsemane, and that the danger was now so very near that
there could be no time for any of them to go and sell his garment in
order to purchase a sword to defend himself and his Master from the
attack of the Jewish mob.

Judea was at this time, as we have already noticed, much infested by
robbers: while our Lord was with his disciples, they were perfectly
safe, being shielded by his miraculous power. Shortly they must go into
every part of the land, and will need weapons to defend themselves
against wild beasts, and to intimidate wicked men, who, if they found
them totally defenceless, would not hesitate to make them their prey, or
take away their life. However the matter may be understood, we may rest
satisfied that these swords were neither to be considered as offensive
weapons, nor instruments to propagate the truth. The genius and spirit
of the Christian religion is equally against both. Perhaps, in this
counsel of our Lord, he refers to the contention about supremacy: as if
he had said, Instead of contending among yourselves about who shall be
the greatest, ye have more need to unite yourselves against the common
enemy, who are now at hand: this counsel was calculated to show them the
necessity of union among themselves, as their enemies were both numerous
and powerful.

Must yet be accomplished - Probably meaning that, though this prophecy
did refer to some particular matter in the time of the prophet, yet it
farther (ετι) related to Christ, and could not have its complete
accomplishment but in his crucifixion as a criminal.

For the things concerning me have an end - As if he had said, My work is
now almost done; yours is only beginning; I am now about to be crucified
and numbered with the transgressors; think what will be done to you, and
what ought to be done by you; and then think if this be a time for you
to be contending with each other. Lightfoot.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">luk 22:38</span></span>

Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough -
These words cannot be well understood as being an answer to the supposed
command of Christ, for every one who had no sword to go and sell his
garment and buy one; for, in this case, they were not enough, or
sufficient, as nine of the disciples must be without any instrument of
defense; but they may be understood as pointing out the readiness and
determination of Peter, and perhaps some others, to defend our Lord:
Thou shalt not be treated as a transgressor; here are two swords, and we
will fight for thee. In [Luk 22:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#033),
Peter had said, he was ready to go with Christ either to prison or
death; which showed his strong resolution to stand by and defend his
Master, even at the expense of his life. But, alas, he depended too much
on himself!

It is enough. The meaning probably is, there is enough said on the
subject; as immediately after this he entered into his agony.

I must here confess that the matter about the swords appear to me very
obscure. I am afraid I do not understand it, and I know of none who
does. Schoettgen and Lightfoot have said much on the subject; others
have endeavored to get rid of the difficulty by translating μαχαιραν a
knife, which was necessary on long journeys for providing forage and
fuel; as they were to depend wholly on their own industry, under God,
for all the necessaries of life, while going through the nations of the
earth, preaching the Gospel to Jews and Gentiles. I cannot say which
sense the reader should prefer.

There appeared an angel - from heaven - It was as necessary that the
fullest evidence should be given, not only of our Lord's Divinity, but
also of his humanity: his miracles sufficiently attested the former; his
hunger, weariness, and agony in the garden, as well as his death and
burial, were proofs of the latter. As man, he needs the assistance of an
angel to support his body, worn down by fatigue and suffering. See at
the end of [Luk 22:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#044) (note).

[Luke 22:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">luk 22:44</span></span>

Prayed more earnestly - With greater emphasis and earnestness than
usual, with strong crying and tears, [Heb
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007); the reason given for which is,
that he was in an agony. Kypke well observes, Vox αγωνια summum animi
angorem et dolorem indicat; et idem est, quod αδημονειν, [Mat
26:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#037); [Mar
14:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#034). "The word αγωνια (agony) points
out the utmost anguish and grief of soul, and is of the same import with
αδημονειν in Matthew and Mark." See the note on [Mat
26:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#037).

Drops of blood - See the note on [Mat
26:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#038). Some have thought that the
meaning of the words is, that the sweat was so profuse that every drop
was as large as a drop of blood, not that the sweat was blood itself:
but this does not appear likely. There have been cases in which persons
in a debilitated state of body, or through horror of soul, have had
their sweat tinged with blood. Dr. Mead from Galen observes, Contingere
interdum, poros ex multo aut fervido spiritu adeo dilatari, ut etiam
exeat sanguis per eos, fiatque sudor sanguineus. "Cases sometimes happen
in which, through mental pressure, the pores may be so dilated that the
blood may issue from them; so that there may be a bloody sweat." And
Bishop Pearce gives an instance from Thuanus (De Thou) of an Italian
gentleman being so distressed with the fear of death that his body was
covered with a bloody sweat. But it is fully evident that the fear of
death could have no place in the mind of our blessed Lord. He was in the
bloom of life, in perfect health, and had never suffered any thing from
disease of any kind; this sweat was most assuredly produced by a
preternatural cause. See at the end of the chapter.

[Luke 22:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#048)

Betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss? - Dost thou attempt to kiss
me as a friend, while thou art delivering me up into the hands of my
enemies? We need not wonder at all this, as Satan himself had entered
into the heart of this traitor, see [Luk
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#003); consequently we can expect
nothing from him but what is fell, deceitful, and cruel.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">luk 22:51</span></span>

Suffer ye thus far - Or, Suffer me to go thus far. As they had now a
firm hold of Christ, [Mat 26:50](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#050), he
wished them to permit him to go as far as Malchus, whose ear was cut
off, that he might heal it. See the objections brought against this
interpretation answered by Kypke; and see the examples he produces.
However, the words may be understood as an address to his disciples: Let
them proceed; make no resistance; for in this way only are the
Scriptures to be fulfilled.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">luk 22:53</span></span>

I was daily with you in the temple - Alluding to the four preceding
days, during the whole of which he taught in the temple, see [Luk
21:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#037), and [Mat
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#017).

This is your hour, and the power of darkness - That is, the time in
which you are permitted to unrein your malice; which ye could not do
before, because God did not permit you; and so perfectly are ye under
his control that neither you nor the prince of darkness can proceed a
hair's breadth against me but through this permission: see at the end of
the chapter. What a comfortable thought is it to the followers of
Christ, that neither men nor demons can act against them but by the
permission of their heavenly Father, and that he will not suffer any of
those who trust in him to be tried above what they are able to bear, and
will make the trial issue in their greater salvation, and in his glory!

26:68](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#068) (note).

Art thou then the Son of God? - They all insisted on an answer to this
question, and the high priest particularly put it to him, [Mat
26:63](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#063).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_071">luk 22:71</span></span>

We ourselves have heard - We have heard him profess himself the Son of
God; he is therefore guilty of blasphemy, and, as an impious pretender
to a Divine mission, we must proceed against and condemn him to death.
See the note on [Mat 26:66](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#066). Thus they
proceeded as far as they could; he must now be brought before Pilate, as
the Jews had no power to put him to death. His trial before Pilate is
related in the subsequent chapter.

On our Lord's agony in the garden, related in the 43d and 44th verses,
much has been written, but to little purpose. The cause of this agony
seems not to have been well understood; and there have been many wild
conjectures concerning it. Some think it was occasioned by "the Divine
wrath pressing in upon him; for, as he was bearing the sin of the world,
God looked on and treated him as if he were a sinner." There is
something very shocking in this supposition; and yet it is truly
astonishing how general it is. The ministry of the angel, in this case,
is a sufficient refutation of this opinion; for what sort of strength
could an angel give Christ against God's indignation? Angelic strength
could not enable him to bear either the sin of the world or God's wrath.
If an angel could have succoured him in this, an angel might have made
the whole atonement. Indeed, the ministry of the angel, who must have
been sent from God, and sent in love too, is a full proof that God's
wrath was not poured out on our blessed Redeemer at this time. Dr.
Lightfoot conjectures that his conflict in the garden was with a devil,
who appeared to him in a bodily shape, most horrible; and that it was
through this apparition that he began to be sore amazed, and very heavy,
[Mar 14:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#033); for, as Satan assaulted
the first Adam in a garden in a bodily shape, it is not unreasonable to
conclude that in the same way he assaulted the second Adam in a garden.
St. Luke tells us, [Luk 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#013), that
when the devil had finished all his temptations, he departed from him
for a season: this season in the garden, probably, was the season, or
fit opportunity, for him to return - the prince of this world came and
found nothing in him, [Joh 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#030). But,
though there was nothing in the immaculate Jesus on which Satan could
work, yet he might, as the doctor supposes, assume some horrible shape,
in order to appal his mind, and shake his firmness; and the evangelist
seems to intimate that he had desired to be permitted to try or sift the
disciples in this way, see [Luk 22:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#031);
and it is probable that it is to some personal, horrid appearance, that
the apostle alludes when he speaks of the messenger of Satan that
buffeted him, [Co2 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007). The angel,
therefore, from heaven, may be supposed to come against this angel from
hell; and, as the one appeared to terrify, the other appeared to
strengthen him. It was not necessary to exert the Divine power to crush
this devil, and therefore an angel from heaven is sent to counteract his
influence. This is the sum of Dr. Lightfoot's reasonings upon this very
difficult subject.

Others suppose that, while our Lord was praying intensely in the garden,
the extreme fervor of his application to God in the behalf of the poor
deluded Jews, and in behalf of the world, was too much for his human
nature to support; that he, in consequence, fell into a swoon, in which
he had a Vision of an angel coming from heaven to strengthen him. Let
these sentiments stand on their respective merits.

What renders this circumstance more difficult is, that there is no
mention of it in any of the other evangelists: and it is worthy of
remark that, among many of the ancients, the authenticity of these two
verses, the 43d and 44th, has been doubted, and in consequence they are
omitted in several MSS., and in some versions and fathers. The Codex
Alexandrinus and the Codex Vaticanus, the two oldest MSS. in the world,
omit both verses; in some other very ancient MSS. they stand with an
asterisk before them, as a mark of dubiousness; and they are both
wanting in the Coptic Fragments published by Dr. Ford. They are however
extant in such a vast number of MSS., versions, and fathers, as to leave
no doubt with most critics of their authenticity. After all that has
been said, or perhaps can be said on this subject, there will remain
mysteries which only the bright light of the eternal world can
sufficiently illustrate. That Christ was now suffering, the just for the
unjust, that he might bring us to God, and that he was bearing in his
body the punishment due to their sins, I have no doubt: and that the
agony of his mind, in these vicarious sufferings, caused the effusion
from his body, of the bloody sweat, may be easily credited without
supposing him to be at all under the displeasure of his heavenly Father;
for, as God can see nothing but as it is, he could not see him as a
sinner who was purity itself. In every act, Jesus was that beloved Son
in whom the Father was ever well pleased.

As to the angel strengthening him, probably no more is meant by it than
a friendly sympathizing of one of those heavenly beings with their Lord
in distress: this circumstance is the most difficult in the whole
relation; but, understood thus, the difficulty is removed; for what
strength could the highest angel in heaven afford to our blessed Lord in
his atoning acts? Surely, none. The bare supposition is insupportable.
But, if we allow that the angel came to sympathize with him during his
passions the whole account will appear plain and consistent.
