### [Deuteronomy Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 2:0</span></span>

Moses continues to relate how they compassed Mount Seir, [Deu
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#001.md). And the commands they received
not to meddle with the descendants of Esau, [Deu
2:2-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#002.md); nor to distress the Moabites,
[Deu 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#009.md). Of the Emims, [Deu
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#010.md), [Deu
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#011.md); the Horims, [Deu
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#012.md). Their passage of the brook
Zered, [Deu 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#013.md). The time they spent
between Kadesh-barnea and Zered, [Deu
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#014.md); during which all the men of war
that came out of Egypt were consumed, [Deu
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#015.md), [Deu
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#016.md). The command not to distress the
Ammonites, [Deu 2:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#017.md). Of the
Zamzummims, [Deu 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#020.md), the Anakims,
[Deu 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#021.md), the Horims, [Deu
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#022.md), the Avims and Caphtorims, all
destroyed by the Ammonites, [Deu 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#023.md).
They are commanded to cross the river Arnon, and are promised the land
of Sihon, king of the Amorites, [Deu
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#024.md), [Deu
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#025.md). Of the message sent to Sihon, to
request a passage through his territories, [Deu
2:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#026.md). His refusal, [Deu
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#030.md).The consequent war, [Deu
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#031.md), [Deu
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#032.md). His total overthrow, [Deu
2:33](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#033.md); and extermination of his people,
[Deu 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#034.md). The spoils that were taken,
[Deu 2:35](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#035.md). And his land possessed from
Aroer to Arnon by the Israelites, [Deu
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#036.md); who took care, according to the
command of God, not to invade any part of the territories of the
Ammonites, [Deu 2:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#037.md).

[Deuteronomy 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 2:3</span></span>

Turn you northward - From Mount Seir, in order to get to Canaan. This
was not the way they went before, viz., by Kadesh-barnea, but they were
to proceed between Edom on the one hand, and Moab and Ammon on the
other, so as to enter into Canaan through the land of the Amorites.

[Deuteronomy 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 2:5</span></span>

Meddle not with them - That is, the Edomites. See on [Num
20:14-21](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#014) (note.md).

[Deuteronomy 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 2:7</span></span>

The Lord - hath blessed thee, etc. - God had given them much property,
and therefore they had no need of plunder; they had gold and silver to
buy the provender they needed, and therefore God would not permit them
to take any thing by violence.

[Deuteronomy 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 2:10</span></span>

The Emims dwelt therein - Calmet supposes that these people were
destroyed in the war made against them by Chedorlaomer and his allies,
[Gen 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#005.md). Lot possessed their country
after the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. They are generally esteemed
as giants; probably they were a hardy, fierce, and terrible people, who
lived, like the wandering Arabs, on the plunder of others. This was
sufficient to gain them the appellation of giants, or men of prodigious
stature. See next verse, [Deu 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#011.md)
(note).

[Deuteronomy 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 2:11</span></span>

Which also were accounted giants - This is not a fortunate version. The
word is not giants, but רפאים Rephaim, the name of a people. It appears
that the Emim, the Anakim, and the Rephaim, were probably the same
people, called by different names in the different countries where they
dwelt; for they appear originally to have been a kind of wandering
free-booters, who lived by plunder. (See on [Deu
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#010) (note).md). It must be granted,
however, that there were several men of this race of extraordinary
stature. And hence all gigantic men have been called Rephaim. (See on
[Gen 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#004) (note.md), and [Gen
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#005) (note).md). But we well know that
fear and public report have often added whole cubits to men's height. It
was under this influence that the spies acted, when they brought the
disheartening report mentioned [Num
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#033.md).

[Deuteronomy 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 2:12</span></span>

The Horims also dwelt in Seir - The whole of this verse was probably
added by Joshua or Ezra.

[Deuteronomy 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">deu 2:20</span></span>

That also was accounted a land of giants - That was accounted the land
or territory of the Rephaim.

Zamzummims - Supposed to be the same as the Zuzim, [Gen
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#005.md). Of these ancient people we know
very little; they were probably inconsiderable tribes or clans,
"pursuing and pursued, each other's prey," till at length a stronger
totally destroyed or subdued them, and their name became either extinct
or absorbed in that of their conquerors. From the 10th to the 12th, and
from the 20th to the 23d verse inclusive ([Deu
2:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#010.md), [Deu
2:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#020).md), we have certain historical
remarks introduced which do not seem to have been made by Moses, but
rather by Joshua or Ezra. By the introduction of these verses the thread
of the narrative suffers considerable interruption. Dr. Kennicott
considers both these passages to be interpolations. That they could not
have made a part of the speech of Moses originally, needs little proof.

[Deuteronomy 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">deu 2:29</span></span>

As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir - See the note on [Num
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#021.md).

[Deuteronomy 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">deu 2:30</span></span>

The Lord - hardened his spirit - See the notes on [Exo
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#021.md), and [Exo
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#015) (note.md), etc.

[Deuteronomy 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">deu 2:36</span></span>

From Aroer - by the brink of the river of Arnon - See on [Num
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#013) (note.md), etc.

[Deuteronomy 2:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">deu 2:37</span></span>

Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not - God gave
them their commission; and those only were to be cut off, the cup of
whose iniquity was full. Though the Moabites and Ammonites were thus
spared, they requited good with evil, for they fought against the
Israelites, and cast them out of their possessions, [Jdg
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#004.md), [Jdg
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#005.md); [Ch2
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#001.md), etc., and committed the most
shocking cruelties; see [Amo 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#013.md).
Hence God enacted a law, that none of these people should enter into the
congregation of the Lord even to their tenth generation: see [Deu
23:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#003.md).
