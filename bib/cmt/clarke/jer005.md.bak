### [Jeremiah Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 5:0</span></span>

The prophet, having described the judgments impending over his
countrymen, enlarges on the corruptions which prevailed among them.
Their profession of religion was all false and hypocritical, [Jer
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#001.md), [Jer
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#002.md). Though corrected, they were not
amended, but persisted in their guilt, [Jer
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#003.md). This was not the case with the
low and ignorant only, [Jer 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#004.md); but
more egregiously so with those of the higher order, from whose knowledge
and opportunities better things might have been expected, [Jer
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#005.md). God therefore threatens them with
the most cruel enemies, [Jer 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#006.md); and
appeals to themselves if they should be permitted to practice such sins
unpunished, [Jer 5:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#007.md). He then
commands their enemies to raze the walls of Jerusalem, [Jer
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#010.md); that devoted city whose
inhabitants added to all their other sins the highest contempt of God's
word and prophets, [Jer 5:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#011.md).
Wherefore his word, in the mouth of his prophet, shall be as fire to
consume them, [Jer 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#014.md); the Chaldean
forces shall cruelly addict them, [Jer
5:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#015.md); and farther judgments await
then as the consequence of their apostasy and idolatry, [Jer
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#018.md), [Jer
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#019.md). The chapter closes with a most
melancholy picture of the moral condition of the Jewish people at that
period which immediately preceded the Babylonish captivity, [Jer
5:20-31](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#020.md).

[Jeremiah 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 5:1</span></span>

Broad places - Market-places, and those where there was most public
resort.

If ye can find a man - A certain philosopher went through the streets of
Athens with a lighted lamp in his hand; and being asked what he sought,
answered, "I am seeking to find a Man." So in Jerusalem none was found,
on the most diligent search, who acted worthy the character of a
rational being.

I will pardon it - I will spare the city for the sake of one righteous
person. So at the intercession of Abraham, God would have spared Sodom
if there had been ten righteous persons found in it; [Gen
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#026.md).

[Jeremiah 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 5:2</span></span>

The Lord liveth - Though they profess to bind themselves by Jehovah, as
if they acknowledged him their God and only Lord, yet they swore
falsely; for not believing in him, they took a false oath; one by which
they did not believe themselves bound, not acknowledging him as their
Lord. See on [Jer 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#002) (note.md).

[Jeremiah 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 5:4</span></span>

These are poor - They are ignorant; they have no education; they know no
better.

[Jeremiah 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 5:5</span></span>

I will get me unto the great men - Those whose circumstances and rank in
life gave them opportunities of information which the others could not
have, for the reasons already given.

These have altogether broken the yoke - These have cast aside all
restraint, have acted above law, and have trampled all moral obligations
under their feet, and into their vortex the lower classes of the people
have been swept away. Solon said, "The laws are like cobwebs; they
entangle the small fry, but the great ones go through them, and carry
all away with them."

[Jeremiah 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 5:6</span></span>

Wherefore a lion - Nebuchadnezzar, according to the general opinion; who
is called here a lion for his courage and violence, a bear for his
rapaciousness, and a leopard for his activity. Dahler supposes the
Scythians to be intended, both here and in [Jer
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#007.md).

[Jeremiah 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 5:7</span></span>

In the harlots' houses - In places consecrated to idolatry. In the
language of the prophets, adultery generally signifies idolatry. This we
have often seen.

[Jeremiah 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 5:8</span></span>

After his neighbor's wife - This may have been literally true, as the
abominations of idolatry, in which they were so deeply practiced, would
necessarily produce such a state of things as that here mentioned.

[Jeremiah 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 5:10</span></span>

Go ye up upon her walls - This is the permission and authority given to
the Chaldeans to pillage Jerusalem.

Take away her battlements - Some translate נטישות netishoth, branches;
others, vines. Destroy the branches, cut down the stem; but do not
damage the root. Leave so many of the people that the state may be
regenerated. The Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic, read, "Leave her
foundations, for they are the Lord's;" and this agrees with "Destroy,
but make not a full end."

[Jeremiah 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 5:12</span></span>

They have belied the Lord - כחשו kichashu. They have denied or disavowed
the Lord.

It is not he - לוא הוא lo hu, he is not; there is no such being;
therefore this evil shall not come upon us. On their premises, this
conclusion was just. There is no judge; therefore there shall be no
judgment. Thus they denied the Lord. They were atheists at heart.

[Jeremiah 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 5:13</span></span>

And the prophets shall become wind - What are the prophets?

Empty persons. Their words are wind; we hear the sound of their
threatening but of the matter of the threatenings we shall hear no more.

And the word is not in them - There is no inspirer, but may their own
predictions fall on their own heads! This seems the natural sense of
this passage.

[Jeremiah 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 5:14</span></span>

Because ye speak this word - Because ye thus treat my message, "I will
make my words in thy mouth fire." They have said they are but air; but I
will make them fire, and a fire too that shall devour them. And how this
was to be done, and by whom, is mentioned in the next verse.

[Jeremiah 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 5:15</span></span>

I will bring a nation - The Scythians, says Dahler; the Babylonians,
whose antiquity was great, that empire being founded by Nimrod.

Whose language thou knowest not - The Chaldee, which, though a dialect
of the Hebrew, is so very different in its words and construction that
in hearing it spoken they could not possibly collect the meaning of what
was said.

[Jeremiah 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 5:16</span></span>

Their quiver is an open sepulcher - They are such exact archers as never
to miss their mark; every arrow is sure to slay one man.

[Jeremiah 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 5:18</span></span>

I will not make a full end - There are more evils in store for you. You
shall not only be spoiled, and all your property destroyed, but ye shall
be carried into captivity; and ye shall serve strangers in a land that
is not yours, [Jer 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#019.md).

[Jeremiah 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 5:22</span></span>

Which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea - What can I not do,
who confine the sea, that enormous mass of waters, and prevent it from
overflowing the earth; not by immense mountains and rocks, but by the
sand, no particle of which is in cohesion with another? The most
tremendous waves cannot displace nor pass over this simple barrier.

[Jeremiah 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 5:23</span></span>

They are revolted and gone - They have abandoned me, and are gone
farther and farther into transgression. They are gone entirely away from
truth and righteousness.

[Jeremiah 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 5:24</span></span>

Giveth rain, both the former and the latter - See the note on [Jer
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#003.md).

The appointed weeks of the harvest - As the early rains fell in the
northern parts of Judea about the end of September, in the civil year of
the Hebrews, so the latter rains fell before harvest, in the months of
March and April. The appointed weeks of the harvest were those which
fell between the passover and pentecost. In the southern parts the
harvest was earlier than in the northern. Dr. Blayney translates, "A
sufficiency of the appointed things of harvest he secureth to us."

If the word שבעת weeks, be read with a ש sin instead of a ש shin, it
will signify fullness or sufficiency; and thus the Septuagint and
Vulgate have read it. I think the present reading is much to be
preferred. God appoints a harvest time, and in his good providence he
generally gives harvest weather.

[Jeremiah 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 5:25</span></span>

Your iniquities have turned away these things - When these appointed
weeks of harvest do not come, should we not examine and see whether this
be not in God's judgments? Have not our iniquities turned away these
good things from us?

[Jeremiah 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 5:26</span></span>

They lay wait, as he that setteth snares - A metaphor taken from
fowlers, who, having fixed their nets, lie down and keep out of sight,
that when birds come, they may be ready to draw and entangle them.

[Jeremiah 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 5:27</span></span>

As a cage is full of birds - There is no doubt that the reference here
is to a decoy or trap-cage, as Dr. Blayney has rendered it; in these the
fowlers put several tame birds, which when the wild ones see, they come
and light on the cage, and fall into the snare.

[Jeremiah 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jer 5:28</span></span>

They judge not the cause, yet they prosper - Perhaps we might be
justified in translating, "And shall they prosper?"

[Jeremiah 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 5:30</span></span>

A wonderful and horrible thing is committed on the land - Dahler
translates: "Strange crimes and horrible trespasses have been committed
in the land." These have been already detailed; but this may refer to
what follows.

[Jeremiah 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jer 5:31</span></span>

The prophets prophesy falsely - The false prophets predict favorable
things, that they may please both the princes and the people.

The priests bear rule by their means - The false prophets affording them
all that their influence and power can procure, to enable them to keep
their places, and feed on the riches of the Lord's house.

And my people love to have it so - Are perfectly satisfied with this
state of things, because they are permitted to continue in their sins
without reproof or restraint. The prophets and the priests united to
deceive and ruin the people. The prophets gave out false predictions; by
their means the priests got the government of the people into their own
hands; and so infatuated were the people that they willingly abandoned
themselves to those blind guides, and would not hearken to the voice of
any reformer. In my Old Bible the words stand thus: - Stonyng and
mervailis ben made in the erthe, prophets prophecieden lesing; and
prestis flappiden with joye with ther bondes, and my peple lovid siche
thingis. False prophets and worldly priests have been in all ages the
bane of religion, and the ruin of many souls. When profligate people
stand up on behalf of profligate priests, corruption must then be at its
height.
