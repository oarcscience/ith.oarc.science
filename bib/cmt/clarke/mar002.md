### [Mark Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#001.md)

[Mark](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mar 2:0</span></span>

Christ preaches in Capernaum, [Mar
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#001.md), [Mar
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#002.md). A paralytic person is brought to
him, whose sins are pronounced forgiven, [Mar
2:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#003.md). The scribes accuse him of
blasphemy, [Mar 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#006.md), [Mar
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#007.md). He vindicates himself, and proves
his power to forgive sins, by healing the man's disease, [Mar
2:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#008.md). The people are astonished and
edified, [Mar 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#012.md). He calls Levi from
the receipt of custom, [Mar 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#013.md), [Mar
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#014.md). Eats in his house with publicans
and sinners, at which the Pharisees murmur, [Mar
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#015.md), [Mar
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#016.md). He vindicates his conduct, [Mar
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#017.md). Vindicates his disciples, who
are accused of not fasting, [Mar
2:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#018.md); and for plucking the ears of
corn on the Sabbath day, [Mar 2:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#023.md);
and teaches the right use of the Sabbath, [Mar
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#027.md), [Mar
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#028.md).

[Mark 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 2:1</span></span>

In the house - The house of Peter, with whom Christ lodged when at
Capernaum. See the notes on [Mat 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#013.md);
[Mat 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#013.md).

[Mark 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 2:2</span></span>

So much as about the door - Meaning the yard or court before the house.

Preached The Word - Τον λογον. The doctrine of the kingdom of God; for
so ὁ λογος is repeatedly used.

[Mark 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 2:3</span></span>

One sick of the palsy - A paralytic person. See on [Mat
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#002) (note.md), etc.

Borne of four - Four men, one at each corner of the sofa or couch on
which he lay: this sick man appears to have been too feeble to come
himself, and too weak to be carried in any other way.

[Mark 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mar 2:4</span></span>

They uncovered the roof - The houses in the east are generally made
flat-roofed, that the inhabitants may have the benefit of taking the air
on them; they are also furnished with battlements round about, [Deu
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#008.md); [Jdg
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#027.md); and [Sa2
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#002.md), to prevent persons from falling
off; and have a trap door by which they descend into the house. This
door, it appears, was too narrow to let down the sick man and his couch;
so they uncovered the roof, removed a part of the tiles; and having
broken it up, taken away the laths or timber, to which the tiles had
been attached, they then had room to let down the afflicted man. See
[Luk 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#019.md), and on [Mat
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#027) (note.md); [Mat
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#017) (note.md).

[Mark 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 2:7</span></span>

Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? - See this explained [Mat
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#003) (note.md), etc.

[Mark 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 2:12</span></span>

He - took up the bed - The words of Prosper, on this place, are worthy
of notice: -

"What is sin but a deplorable fall, a grovelling on the earth, a repose
in the creature, often followed by a universal palsy of the soul;
namely, an utter inability to help itself, to break off its evil habits,
to walk in the ways of God, to rise or to take one good step towards
him? Grace can repair all in a moment: because it is nothing but the
almighty will of God, who commands and does whatever he commands."

[Mark 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 2:14</span></span>

Levi - The same as Matthew; he appears to have been a Jew, though
employed in the odious office of a tax-gatherer. For an account of his
call, see his Gospel, [Mat 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#009.md), etc.

[Mark 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mar 2:16</span></span>

Sinners - By ἁμαρτωλοι, the Gentiles or heathens are generally to be
understood in the Gospels, for this was a term the Jews never applied to
any of themselves, See the note on [Mat
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#010.md).

How is it that he eateth - Some very good MSS., several versions, with
Chrysostom and Augustin, read, Why doth Your Master eat?

[Mark 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mar 2:17</span></span>

To repentance - This is omitted by ABDKL, twenty-seven others; both the
Syriac, Persic, Coptic, Ethiopic, Armenian, Gothic, Vulgate; six copies
of the Itala; Euthymius and Augustin. Griesbach has left it out of the
text; Grotius, Mill, and Bengel approve of the omission. See on [Mat
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#013) (note.md). I leave it as in the
parallel place above quoted. Properly speaking, the righteous cannot be
called to repentance. They have already forsaken sin, mourned for it,
and turned to God. In the other parallel place, [Luk
5:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#032.md), all the MSS. and versions retain
μετανοιαν, repentance.

[Mark 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mar 2:18</span></span>

Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast - See this
largely explained on [Mat 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#014) (note.md),
etc. The following vices are very common to Pharisees.

1\. They are more busied in censuring the conduct of others than in
rectifying their own.

2\. They desire that every one should regulate his piety by theirs; and
embrace their particular customs and forms of devotion.

3\. They speak of and compare themselves with other people, only that
they may have an opportunity of distinguishing and exalting themselves.

On the nature, times, and duration of fasting, see [Mat
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#016.md); [Mat
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#015.md).

[Mark 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mar 2:19</span></span>

Can the children of the bride-chamber fast while the bridegroom is with
them? - Among the Hindoos, large parties of friends, belonging both to
the bride and bridegroom, attend on both during the wedding day; on the
following day, when the bridegroom leaves the house of his
father-in-law, the attendants are filled with sorrow, especially the
near relations. - Ward's Customs.

[Mark 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mar 2:20</span></span>

In those days - But instead of εν εκειναις ταις ἡμεραις, many of the
best MSS. and versions read, εν εκεινῃ τῃ ἡμερᾳ, in that day; viz. the
day in which Jesus Christ should be delivered up to the Jews and
Gentiles. Mill and Bengel approve of this reading, and Griesbach adopts
it. The former part of the verse seems to vindicate the common reading.

[Mark 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mar 2:21</span></span>

No man - seweth - See [Mat 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#016.md). No
man seweth a piece of unscoured cloth upon an old garment. In the common
editions this verse begins with και, and, but this is omitted by almost
every MS. and version of note. The construction of the whole verse is
various in the MSS. The translation given here, and in [Mat
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#016.md), is intelligible, and speaks for
itself.

[Mark 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mar 2:23</span></span>

Went through the corn fields - See on [Mat
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001) (note.md).

[Mark 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 2:26</span></span>

The days of Abiathar the high priest - It appears from [Sa1
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#001.md), which is the place referred to
here, that Ahimelech was then high priest at Nob: and from [Sa1
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#020.md); [Sa1
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#006.md), and [Ch1
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#016.md), it appears that Abiathar was
the son of Ahimelech. The Persic reads Abimelech instead of Abiathar.
Theophylact supposes that Abiathar was the priest, and Ahimelech or
Abimelech the high priest, and thus endeavors to reconcile both the
sacred historians. Others reconcile the accounts thus: Ahimelech was
called Ahimelech Abiathar, אב ab, father, understood; and Abiathar was
called Abiathar Ahimelech, בן ben, son, understood. Probably they both
officiated in the high priesthood; and the name of the office was
indifferently applied to either.

Shew-bread - See [Mat 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#004.md).

[Mark 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 2:27</span></span>

The Sabbath was made for man - That he might have the seventh part of
his whole time to devote to the purposes of bodily rest and spiritual
exercises. And in these respects it is of infinite use to mankind. Where
no Sabbath is observed, there disease, poverty, and profligacy,
generally prevail. Had we no Sabbath, we should soon have no religion.
This whole verse is wanting in the Codex Bezae, and in five of the
Itala.

[Mark 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mar 2:28</span></span>

The Son of man is Lord - See on [Mat
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#007.md), [Mat
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#008) (note.md). Some have understood this
as applying to men in general, and not to Christ. The Son of man, any
man is Lord of the Sabbath; i.e. it was made for him, for his ease,
comfort, and use, and to these purposes he is to apply it. But this is a
very harsh, and at the same time a very lax, mode of interpretation; for
it seems to say that a man may make what use he pleases of the Sabbath;
and, were this true, the moral obligation of the Sabbath would soon be
annihilated.

God ordained the Sabbath not only to be a type of that rest which
remains for the people of God, but to be also a mean of promoting the
welfare of men in general.

The ordinances of religion should be regulated according to their end,
which is the honor of God, and the salvation of men. It is the property
of the true religion to contain nothing in it but what is beneficial to
man. Hereby God plainly shows that it is neither out of indigence or
interest that he requires men to worship and obey him; but only out of
goodness, and to make them happy. God prohibited work on the Sabbath
day, lest servants should be oppressed by their masters, that the
laboring beasts might have necessary rest, and that men might have a
proper opportunity to attend upon his ordinances, and get their souls
saved. To the Sabbath, under God, we owe much of what is requisite and
necessary as well for the body as the soul.
