### [John Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#001)

[John](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">joh 20:0</span></span>

Mary Magdalene, coming early to the sepulchre, finds it empty, and runs
and tells Peter, [Joh 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#001), [Joh
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#002). Peter and John run to the tomb,
and find all as Mary had reported, [Joh
20:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#003). Mary sees a vision of angels
in the tomb, [Joh 20:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#011). Jesus
himself appears to her, and sends her with a message to the disciples,
[Joh 20:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#014). He appears to the
disciples, gives the fullest proof of the reality of his resurrection,
and communicates to them a measure of the Holy Spirit, [Joh
20:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019). The determined incredulity
of Thomas, [Joh 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#024), [Joh
20:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#025). Eight days after, Jesus appears
again to the disciples, Thomas being present, to whom he gives the
proofs he had desired, [Joh 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#026),
[Joh 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#027). Thomas is convinced, and
makes a noble confession, [Joh 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#028).
Our Lord's reflections on his case, [Joh
20:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#029). Various signs done by Christ,
not circumstantially related, [Joh
20:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#030). Why others are recorded, [Joh
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#031).

All that John relates concerning the resurrection of our Lord he has
collected partly from the account given by Mary Magdalene, and partly
from his own observations. From Mary he derived the information given,
[Joh 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#001), [Joh
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#002), and from [Joh
20:11-18](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#011). From his own actual
knowledge, what he relates, [Joh
3:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#003), [Joh
3:19-29](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019), and the whole of John
21:1-25. It is supposed that he details the account given by Mary,
without altering any circumstance, and without either addition or
retrenchment. See Rosenmuller.

[John 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 20:1</span></span>

The first day of the week - On what we call Sunday morning, the morning
after the Jewish Sabbath. As Christ had been buried in haste, these holy
women had bought aromatics, [Mar 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#001);
[Luk 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#001), to embalm him afresh, and
in a more complete manner than it could have been done by Joseph and
Nicodemus. John only mentions Mary of Magdala, because he appears to
wish to give a more detailed history of her conduct than of any of the
rest; but the other evangelists speak of three persons who went together
to the tomb, viz. Mary of Magdala, Mary the mother of James, and Salome:
[Mat 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#001); [Mar
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#001).

[John 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 20:2</span></span>

Then she runneth - This was after the women had seen the angels, who
said he was risen from the dead, [Luk
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#004). She told, not only Peter and
John, but the other apostles also, [Mat
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#008); but only the two disciples above
mentioned went to the tomb to see whether what she had said was true.

They have taken away the Lord - She mentions nothing of what the angels
had said, in her hurry and confusion; she speaks things only by halves;
and probably the vision of angels might have appeared to her only as an
illusion of her own fancy, and not to be any farther regarded.

[John 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 20:4</span></span>

Outrun Peter - Not because he had a greater desire to see into the truth
of these things; but because he was younger, and lighter of foot.

[John 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 20:5</span></span>

Went he not in - Why? Because he was fully satisfied that the body was
not there. But why did he not seize upon the linen clothes, and keep
them as a most precious relic? Because he had too much religion and too
much sense; and the time of superstition and nonsense was not yet
arrived, in which bits of rotten wood, rags of rotten cloth, decayed
bones (to whom originally belonging no one knows) and bramble bushes,
should become objects of religious adoration.

[John 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 20:6</span></span>

Seeth the linen clothes lie - Θεωπει: from θεαομαι, to behold, and ὁραω,
to see - to look steadily at any thing, so as to discover what it is,
and to be satisfied with viewing it.

[John 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 20:7</span></span>

Wrapped together in a place by itself - The providence of God ordered
these very little matters, so that they became the fullest proofs
against the lie of the chief priests, that the body had been stolen away
by the disciples. If the body had been stolen away, those who took it
would not have stopped to strip the clothes from it, and to wrap them
up, and lay them by in separate places.

[John 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 20:8</span></span>

That other disciple - John.

Saw - That the body was not there.

And believed - That it had been taken away, as Mary had said; but he did
not believe that he was risen from the dead. See what follows.

[John 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 20:9</span></span>

They knew not the scripture - Viz. [Psa
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#009), [Psa
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010) : Thou wilt not leave my soul in
hell - כי לא תעזב נפשי לשאול ki lo taazob naphshi l'sheol - For thou
wilt not abandon my life to the grave, nor suffer thy Holy One to see
corruption. It was certainly a reproach to the disciples that they had
not understood this prophecy, when our Lord had given them often the
most direct information concerning it. Christ had referred to the
history of Jonah, [Mat 12:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#040), which
was at once the type and the proof of his own resurrection. However,
this ingenuous confession of John, in a matter so dishonorable to
himself, is a full proof of his sincerity, and of the truth of his
narration.

[John 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 20:10</span></span>

Unto their own home - Either to their own houses, if they still had any;
or to those of their friends, or to those where they had a hired
lodging, and where they met together for religious purposes. See [Joh
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019).

[John 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 20:11</span></span>

But Mary stood without - She remained some time after Peter and John had
returned to their own homes.

[John 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 20:12</span></span>

Seeth two angels - See on [Joh 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#006)
(note). She knew these to be angels by their white and glistening robes.
Matthew and Mark mention but one angel - probably that one only that
spoke, [Joh 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#013).

One at the head, and the other at the feet - So were the cherubim placed
at each end of the mercy-seat: [Exo
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#018), [Exo
25:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#019). Lightfoot.

[John 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 20:13</span></span>

They have taken away my Lord - It was conjectured, on [Joh
19:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#042), that the body of our Lord was
only put here for the time being, that, after the Sabbath, they might
carry it to a more proper place. Mary seems to refer to this: They have
taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him. This
removal she probably attributed to some of our Lord's disciples, or to
some of his friends.

[John 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 20:14</span></span>

She turned herself back - Or, εστραφη εις τα οπισω, she was turned back,
i.e. to go again with the other women to Jerusalem, who had already
departed; but she had not as yet gone so far as to be out of the garden.

Knew not that it was Jesus - John has here omitted what the angels said
to the women, about Christ's being risen; probably because it was so
particularly related by the other evangelists: [Mat
28:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#005); [Mar
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#006), [Mar
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#007); [Luk
24:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#005). Mary was so absorbed in grief
that she paid but little attention to the person of our Lord, and
therefore did not at first discern it to be him; nor could she imagine
such an appearance possible, as she had no conception of his
resurrection from the dead. She was therefore every way unprepared to
recognize the person of our Lord.

[John 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 20:15</span></span>

Supposing him to be the gardener - Κηπουρος, the inspector or overseer
of the garden, from κηπος, a garden, and ουρος, an inspector - the
person who had the charge of the workmen, and the care of the produce of
the garden; and who rendered account to the owner.

And I will take him away - How true is the proverb, Love feels no load!
Jesus was in the prime of life when he was crucified, and had a hundred
pounds weight of spices added to his body; and yet Mary thinks of
nothing less than carrying him away with her, if she can but find where
he is laid!

[John 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 20:16</span></span>

Mary - This word was no doubt spoken with uncommon emphasis; and the
usual sound of Christ's voice accompanied it, so as immediately to prove
that it must be Jesus. What transports of joy must have filled this
woman's heart! Let it be remarked that Mary Magdalene sought Jesus more
fervently, and continued more affectionately attached to him than any of
the rest: therefore to her first, Jesus is pleased to show himself, and
she is made the first herald of the Gospel of a risen Savior.

After Mary's exclamation of Rabboni, and its interpretation by the
evangelist, one MS., the later Syriac, Syriac Hieros., and three copies
of the Itala, add και προσεδραμεν ἁψασθαι αυτου, And she ran to embrace,
or cling to him. Then our Lord's words come in with the reason for them.

[John 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 20:17</span></span>

Touch me not - Μη μου ἁπτου, Cling not to me. Ἁπτομαι has this sense in
[Job 31:7](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#007), where the Septuagint use it
for the Hebrew דבק dabak, which signifies to cleave, cling, stick, or be
glued to. From [Mat 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#009), it appears
that some of the women held him by the feet and worshipped him. This
probably Mary did; and our Lord seems to have spoken to her to this
effect: "Spend no longer time with me now: I am not going immediately to
heaven - you will have several opportunities of seeing me again: but go
and tell my disciples, that I am, by and by, to ascend to my Father and
God, who is your Father and God also. Therefore, let them take courage."

[John 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 20:18</span></span>

Told the disciples - that he had spoken these things - St. Mark says,
[Mar 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#011), that the afflicted
apostles could not believe what she had said. They seem to have
considered it as an effect of her troubled imagination.

[John 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 20:19</span></span>

The doors were shut - for fear of the Jews - We do not find that the
Jews designed to molest the disciples: that word of authority which
Christ spoke, [Joh 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#008), Let these go
away - had prevented the Jews from offering them any injury; but, as
they had proceeded so far as to put Christ to death, the faith of the
disciples not being very strong, they were led to think that they should
be the next victims if found. Some think, therefore, that they had the
doors not only shut, but barricadoed: nevertheless Jesus came in, the
doors being shut, i.e. while they continued shut. But how? By his
almighty power: and farther we know not. Yet it is quite possible that
no miraculous influence is here intended. The doors might be shut for
fear of the Jews; and Jesus might open them, and enter in the ordinary
way. Where there is no need for a miracle, a miracle is never wrought.
See on [Joh 20:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#030) (note).

The evangelist has omitted the appearing of our Lord to the other women
who came from the tomb, [Mat 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#009), and
that to the two disciples who were going to Emmaus, [Luk
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#013), etc., which all happened in the
course of this same day.

Peace be unto you - His usual salutation and benediction. May every
blessing of heaven and earth which you need be granted unto you!

[John 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 20:20</span></span>

He showed unto them his hands and his side - So it appears that his body
bore the marks of the nails and the spear; and these marks were
preserved that the disciples might be the more fully convinced of the
reality of his resurrection.

[John 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 20:21</span></span>

Even so send I you - As I was sent to proclaim the truth of the Most
High, and to convert sinners to God, I send you for the very same
purpose, clothed with the very same authority, and influenced by the
very same Spirit.

[John 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 20:22</span></span>

He breathed on them - Intimating, by this, that they were to be made new
men, in order to be properly qualified for the work to which he had
called them; for in this breathing he evidently alluded to the first
creation of man, when God breathed into him the breath of lives, and he
became a living soul: the breath or Spirit of God (רוח אלהים ruach
Elohim) being the grand principle and cause of his spiritual and Divine
life.

Receive ye the Holy Ghost - From this act of our Lord, the influences of
the Holy Spirit on the souls of men have been termed his inspiration;
from in, into, and spiro, I breathe. Every word of Christ which is
received in the heart by faith comes accompanied by this Divine
breathing; and, without this, there is neither light nor life. Just as
Adam was before God breathed the quickening spirit into him, so is every
human soul till it receives this inspiration. Nothing is seen, known,
discerned, or felt of God, but through this. To every private Christian
this is essentially requisite; and no man ever did or ever can preach
the Gospel of God, so as to convince and convert sinners, without it.
"There are many (says pious Quesnel) who extol the dignity of the
apostolic mission, and compare that of bishops and pastors with that of
Christ; but with what shame and fear ought they to be filled, if they do
but compare the life and deportment of Christ with the lives and
conversation of those who glory in being made partakers of his mission.
They may depend on it that, if sent at all, they are only sent on the
same conditions, and for the same end, namely - to preach the truth, and
to establish the kingdom of God, by opposing the corruption of the
world; and by acting and suffering to the end, for the advancement of
the glory of God. That person is no other than a monster in the Church
who, by his sacred office, should be a dispenser of the Spirit, and who,
by the corruption of his own heart, and by a disorderly, worldly,
voluptuous, and scandalous life, is, at the same time, a member and
instrument of the devil."

[John 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 20:23</span></span>

Whose soever sins ye remit - See the notes on [Mat
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#019); [Mat
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#018). It is certain God alone can
forgive sins; and it would not only be blasphemous, but grossly absurd,
to say that any creature could remit the guilt of a transgression which
had been committed against the Creator. The apostles received from the
Lord the doctrine of reconciliation, and the doctrine of condemnation.
They who believed on the Son of God, in consequence of their preaching,
had their sins remitted; and they who would not believe were declared to
lie under condemnation. The reader is desired to consult the note
referred to above, where the custom to which our Lord alludes is
particularly considered. Dr. Lightfoot supposes that the power of life
and death, and the power of delivering over to Satan, which was granted
to the apostles, is here referred to. This was a power which the
primitive apostles exclusively possessed.

[John 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 20:24</span></span>

Thomas - called Didymus - See this name explained, [Joh
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#016) (note).

Was not with them - And, by absenting himself from the company of the
disciples, he lost this precious opportunity of seeing and hearing
Christ; and of receiving (at this time) the inestimable blessing of the
Holy Ghost. Where two or three are assembled in the name of Christ, he
is in the midst of them. Christ had said this before: Thomas should have
remembered it, and not have forsaken the company of the disciples. What
is the consequence? - His unbelief becomes

1st. Utterly unreasonable. Ten of his brethren witnessed that they had
seen Christ, [Joh 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#025); but he
rejected their testimony.

2dly. His unbelief became obstinate: he was determined not to believe on
any evidence that it might please God to give him: he would believe
according to his own prejudices, or not at all.

3dly. His unbelief became presumptuous and insolent: a view of the
person of Christ will not suffice: he will not believe that it is he,
unless he can put his finger into the holes made by the nails in his
Lord's hand, and thrust his hand into the wound made by the spear in his
side.

Thomas had lost much good, and gained much evil, and yet was insensible
of his state. Behold the consequences of forsaking the assemblies of
God's people! Jesus comes to the meeting - a disciple is found out of
his place, who might have been there; and he is not only not blessed,
but his heart becomes hardened and darkened through the deceitfulness of
sin. It was through God's mere mercy that ever Thomas had another
opportunity of being convinced of his error. Reader! take warning.

[John 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 20:26</span></span>

After eight days - It seems likely that this was precisely on that day
se'nnight, on which Christ had appeared to them before; and from this we
may learn that this was the weekly meeting of the apostles; and, though
Thomas was not found at the former meeting, he was determined not to be
absent from this. According to his custom, Jesus came again; for he
cannot forget his promise - two or three are assembled in his name; and
he has engaged to be among them.

[John 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 20:27</span></span>

Then saith he to Thomas - Through his infinite compassion, he addressed
him in a particular manner; condescending in this case to accommodate
himself to the prejudices of an obstinate, though sincere, disciple.

Reach hither thy finger, etc. - And it is very probable that Thomas did
so; for his unbelief was too deeply rooted to be easily cured.

[John 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 20:28</span></span>

Thomas answered, etc. - Those who deny the Godhead of Christ would have
us to believe that these words are an exclamation of Thomas, made
through surprise, and that they were addressed to the Father and not to
Christ. Theodore of Mopsuestia was the first, I believe, who gave the
words this turn; and the fifth Ecumenic council, held at Constantinople,
anathematized him for it. This was not according to the spirit of the
Gospel of God. However, a man must do violence to every rule of
construction who can apply the address here to any but Christ. The text
is plain: Jesus comes in - sees Thomas, and addresses him; desiring him
to come to him, and put his finger into the print of the nails, etc.
Thomas, perfectly satisfied of the reality of our Lord's resurrection,
says unto him, - My Lord! and My God! i.e. Thou art indeed the very same
person, - my Lord whose disciple I have so long been; and thou art my
God, henceforth the object of my religious adoration. Thomas was the
first who gave the title of God to Jesus; and, by this glorious
confession, made some amends for his former obstinate incredulity. It is
worthy of remark, that from this time forward the whole of the disciples
treated our Lord with the most supreme respect, never using that
familiarity towards him which they had often used before. The
resurrection from the dead gave them the fullest proof of the divinity
of Christ. And this, indeed, is the use which St. John makes of this
manifestation of Christ. See [Joh
20:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#030), [Joh
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#031). Bishop Pearce says here:
"Observe that Thomas calls Jesus his God, and that Jesus does not
reprove him for it, though probably it was the first time he was called
so." And, I would ask, could Jesus be jealous of the honor of the true
God - could he be a prophet - could he be even an honest man, to permit
his disciple to indulge in a mistake so monstrous and destructive, if it
had been one?

[John 20:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 20:29</span></span>

Thomas - This word is omitted by almost every MS., version, and ancient
commentator of importance.

Blessed are they, etc. - Thou hast seen, and therefore thou hast
believed, and now thou art blessed; thou art now happy - fully convinced
of my resurrection; yet no less blessed shall all those be who believe
in my resurrection, without the evidence thou hast had. From this we
learn that to believe in Jesus, on the testimony of his apostles, will
put a man into the possession of the very same blessedness which they
themselves enjoyed. And so has God constituted the whole economy of
grace that a believer, at eighteen hundred years' distance from the time
of the resurrection, suffers no loss because he has not seen Christ in
the flesh. The importance and excellence of implicit faith in the
testimony of God is thus stated by Rab. Tanchum: "Rab. Simeon ben
Lachesh saith, The proselyte is more beloved by the holy blessed God
than that whole crowd that stood before Mount Sinai; for unless they had
heard the thundering, and seen the flames and lightning, the hills
trembling, and the trumpets sounding, they had not received the law. But
the proselyte hath seen nothing of all this, and yet he hath come in,
devoting himself to the holy blessed God, and hath taken upon him (the
yoke of) the kingdom of heaven."

Reader! Christ died for thee! - believe, and thou shalt be saved, and
become as blessed and as happy as an apostle.

[John 20:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 20:30</span></span>

Many other signs truly did Jesus, etc. - That is, besides the two
mentioned here. [Joh 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019), [Joh
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#026), viz. Christ's entering into the
house in a miraculous manner twice, notwithstanding the doors were fast
shut: see on [Joh 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019) (note). The
other miracles which our Lord did, and which are not related here, were
such as were necessary to the disciples only, and therefore not revealed
to mankind at large. There is nothing in the whole revelation of God but
what is for some important purpose, and there is nothing left out that
could have been of any real use.

[John 20:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#031)

That ye might believe - What is here recorded is to give a full proof of
the Divinity of Christ; that he is the promised Messiah; that he really
suffered and rose again from the dead; and that through him every
believer might have eternal life.

Life - Several MSS., versions, and fathers read eternal life, and this
is undoubtedly the meaning of the word, whether the various reading be
admitted or not.

Grotius has conjectured that the Gospel, as written by St. John, ended
with this chapter, and that the following chapter was added by the
Church of Ephesus. This conjecture is supported by nothing in antiquity.
It is possible that these two last verses might have formerly been at
the conclusion of the last chapter, as they bear a very great similarity
to those that are found there; and it is likely that their true place is
between the 24th and 25th verses of the succeeding chapter; with the
latter of which they in every respect correspond, and with it form a
proper conclusion to the book. Except this correspondence, there is no
authority for changing their present position.

After reading the Gospel of John, his first Epistle should be next taken
up: it is written exactly in the same spirit, and keeps the same object
steadily in view. As John's Gospel may be considered a supplement to the
other evangelists, so his first Epistle may be considered a supplement
and continuation to his own Gospel. In some MSS. the epistles follow
this Gospel, not merely because the transcribers wished to have all the
works of the same writer together, but because there was such an evident
connection between them. The first Epistle is to the Gospel as a pointed
and forcible application is to an interesting and impressive sermon.
