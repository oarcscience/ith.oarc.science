### [Mark Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#001.md)

[Mark](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mar 6:0</span></span>

Our Lord's countrymen are astonished at his wisdom and mighty works, and
are offended at him, [Mar 6:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#001.md). He
works few miracles there, because of their unbelief, [Mar
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#005.md), [Mar
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#006.md). He sends forth his disciples by
two and two to preach, etc., [Mar
6:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#007.md). They depart, preach, and work
miracles, [Mar 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#012.md), [Mar
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#013.md). Different opinions of Christ,
[Mar 6:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#014.md). Account of the beheading
of John Baptist, [Mar 6:17-29](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#017.md). The
disciples return, and give an account of their mission, [Mar
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#030.md). He departs with them to a place
of privacy, but the people follow him, [Mar
6:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#031.md). He has compassion on them,
and miraculously feeds five thousand with five loaves and two fishes,
[Mar 6:34-44](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#034.md). He sends the disciples
by sea to Bethsaida, and himself goes into a mountain to pray, [Mar
6:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#045.md), [Mar
6:46](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#046.md). The disciples meet with a storm,
and he comes to them walking upon the water, and appeases the winds and
the sea, [Mar 6:47-52](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#047.md). They come into
the land of Gennesaret, and he works many miracles, [Mar
6:53-56](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#053.md).

[Mark 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 6:1</span></span>

And he went out from thence - That is, from Capernaum. See on [Mat
13:54](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#054) (note.md).

[Mark 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 6:2</span></span>

Were astonished - επι τῃ διδαχῃ αυτου, at his doctrine, or teaching.
This is added by the Codex Bezae and eight others, later Syriac,
Armenian, Vulgate, and all the Itala.

[Mark 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 6:3</span></span>

Is not this the carpenter - Among the ancient Jews, every father was
bound to do four things for his son.

1\. To circumcise him.

2\. To redeem him.

3\. To teach him the law.

4\. To teach him a trade.

And this was founded on the following just maxim: "He who teaches not
his son to do some work, is as if he taught him robbery!" It is
therefore likely that Joseph brought up our Lord to his own trade.

Joses - Several good MSS. read Ιωσητος, Joset, and one, with several
versions, reads Joseph.

[Mark 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mar 6:4</span></span>

See this curious subject explained, [Mat
13:55-58](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#055) (note.md).

[Mark 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 6:7</span></span>

By two and two - That they might encourage and support each other; and
to show that union among the ministers of the Gospel is essential to the
promotion of the cause of truth. See on [Luk
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001) (note.md).

[Mark 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mar 6:8</span></span>

A staff only - It is likely he desired them to take only one with every
two, merely for the purpose of carrying any part of their clothes on,
when they should be obliged to strip them off by reason of the heat; for
walking staves, or things of this kind, were forbidden, see [Mat
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#010.md). But, probably, no more is
designed than simply to state that they must not wait to make any
provision for the journey, but go off just as they were, leaving the
provision necessary in the present case to the care of Divine
Providence. St. James is represented in ancient paintings, as carrying a
gourd bottle on a Staff across his shoulder.

[Mark 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 6:9</span></span>

Shod with sandals - The sandal seems to have been similar to the Roman
solea, which covered only the sole of the foot, and was fastened about
the foot and ankle with straps. The sandal was originally a part of the
woman's dress; ancient authors represent them as worn only by women. In
[Mat 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#010.md), the disciples are
commanded to take no shoes, ὑποδηματα, which word is nearly of the same
import with σανδαλια, sandals; but, as our Lord intimates to them that
they should be free from all useless incumbrances, that they might
fulfill his orders with the utmost diligence and despatch, so we may
suppose that the sandal was a lighter kind of wear than the shoe: and
indeed the word sandal, which is mere Chaldee, סנדל might be properly
translated a light shoe; as it is compounded of סין sin, a shoe, (see
Targum, [Deu 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#009.md), [Deu
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#010).md), and דל dal, thin, slender, or
mean, as being made, not only lighter than the hypodema or shoe, but
(probably) also of meaner materials. See many excellent observations on
this subject in Martinius's Etymolog. Lexicon, under the word Sandalium.

[Mark 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 6:11</span></span>

And whosoever shall not receive you - Ὁς αν τοπος μη δεξηται, whatsoever
Place will not receive you: this is the reading of BL, four others, and
the later Syriac in the margin.

Verily, etc. - All this clause is omitted in BCDL, two others, one
Arabic, one Persic, Coptic, Armenian, Vulgate, and all the Itala but
three. Mill and Beza approve of the omission, and Griesbach leaves it
out of the text. It has probably been transferred here from [Mat
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#015.md). See this subject, from [Mar
6:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#007.md), explained at large on [Mat
10:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#001) (note.md).

[Mark 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 6:13</span></span>

Anointed with oil many that were sick - This is only spoken of here, and
in [Jam 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#014.md). This ceremony was in
great use among the Jews; and in certain cases it might be profitable.
But in the cases mentioned here, which were merely miraculous, it could
avail no more of itself than the imposition of hands. It was used
symbolically, as an emblem of that ease, comfort, and joy, which they
prayed God to impart to the sick. For various examples of its use among
the Jews, see Lightfoot and Wetstein on this place.

[Mark 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 6:14</span></span>

And king Herod heard? - Την ακοην αοτου, his fame, is added by KM,
fifteen others, and in the margin of several. It seems necessary to
complete the sense.

[Mark 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 6:15</span></span>

Or, as one of the prophets - η, or, is omitted by ABCEGHKLMS - BHV, and
one hundred others, Syriac, all the Arabic, all the Persic, Coptic,
Ethiopic, Gothic, Slavonic, Vulgate, two Itala, Origen, Victor, and
Theophylact. Bengel, Wetstein, and Griesbach leave it out of the text:
the omission of it mends the sense much.

[Mark 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mar 6:19</span></span>

Would have killed - Εζητει, Sought to kill him. C and five of the Itala.

See the whole of this account, from [Mar
6:17-29](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#017.md), explained on [Mat
14:2-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#002) (note.md).

[Mark 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mar 6:21</span></span>

Lords - Μεγιστασιν, probably governors of particular districts.

High captains - Χιλιαρχοις; literally, chiefs or captains over a
thousand men, military chiefs.

Chief estates - Πρωτοις; probably such as might be called nobles by
title only, having no office civil or military; probably magistrates.
See Kypke an the place.

[Mark 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mar 6:23</span></span>

Unto the half of my kingdom - A noble price for a dance! This
extravagance in favor of female dancers has the fullest scope in the
east, even to the present day. M. Anquetil du Perron, in the preliminary
discourse to his Zend Avesta, p. 344 and 345, gives a particular account
of the dancers at Surat. This account cannot be transcribed in a comment
on the Gospel of God, however illustrative it might be of the conduct of
Herodias and her daughter Salome: it is too abominable for a place here.
He observes, that the rich vie with each other in the presents they make
to the dancing girls of money and jewels; and that persons of opulence
have even ruined themselves by the presents they made to those victims
of debauch. He mentions a remarkable case, which may throw light on this
passage: "That the dancer Laal-koner gained such a complete ascendancy
over the Mogul Emperor Maaz-eddin, that he made her joint governess of
the empire with himself."

[Mark 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 6:26</span></span>

For their sakes which sat with him - Probably these persons joined in
with the request, and were glad of this opportunity to get this light of
Israel extinguished; he being a public reprover of all their vices.

[Mark 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mar 6:30</span></span>

The apostles gathered themselves together - For they went different ways
before, by two and two, [Mar 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#007.md); and
now they return and meet Christ at Capernaum.

[Mark 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mar 6:31</span></span>

Rest a while - Rest is necessary for those who labor; and a zealous
preacher of the Gospel will as often stand in need of it as a galley
slave.

[Mark 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mar 6:33</span></span>

The people - Or, οχλοι, the multitudes. This is wanting in many MSS.,
but it seems necessary to make the sense clear. There is scarcely a
verse in the whole New Testament that has suffered so much from
transcribers as this verse. Amidst the abundance of various readings,
one can scarcely tell what its original state was. The various readings
may be seen in Griesbach.

[Mark 6:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mar 6:34</span></span>

Much people, etc. - See this miracle explained on [Mat
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#014) (note.md), etc.

[Mark 6:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">mar 6:40</span></span>

By hundreds, and by fifties - "That is," says Mr. Wesley, "fifty in a
rank, and a hundred in file. So, a hundred multiplied by fifty, made
just five thousand." But if they sat fifty deep, how could the disciples
conveniently serve them with the bread and fish?

[Mark 6:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mar 6:41</span></span>

And blessed - I think the word God should be inserted here, as in [Mat
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#019.md). See the note there. The food we
receive from God is already blessed, and does not stand in need of being
blessed by man; but God, who gives it, deserves our warmest
thanksgivings, as frequently as we are called to partake of his bounty.

[Mark 6:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">mar 6:43</span></span>

Twelve baskets - These were either the baskets used by the disciples,
see [Mat 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#020.md), or baskets belonging
to some of the multitude, who might have brought some with them to carry
provisions, or other things necessary for the sick, whom they brought to
Christ to be healed.

[Mark 6:44](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">mar 6:44</span></span>

Were about five thousand - ὡσει, about, is omitted by a great majority
of the best MSS. and by the principal versions. It is wanting in several
editions: Bengel, Wetstein, and Griesbach, leave it out of the text. It
is omitted by some in the parallel place, [Mat
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#021.md), but it stands without any
variation in [Luk 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#014.md), and [Joh
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#010.md). This miracle is mentioned by all
the four evangelists. It is one of the most astonishing that Christ has
wrought. It is a miracle which could not be counterfeited, and a full
proof of the divinity of Christ.

[Mark 6:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">mar 6:45</span></span>

To the other side before unto Bethsaida - John says, [Joh
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#017.md), to Capernaum. It is probable our
Lord ordered them to steer to one or other of these two places, which
were about four miles distant, and on the same side of the sea of
Galilee.

[Mark 6:47](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">mar 6:47</span></span>

The ship was in the midst of the sea - See all the parts of this
wonderful transaction considered, on [Mat
14:22-33](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#022) (note.md).

[Mark 6:49](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">mar 6:49</span></span>

They supposed it had been a spirit - That is, by whom the storm had been
raised.

[Mark 6:52](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">mar 6:52</span></span>

Their heart was hardened - See this explained [Mat
14:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#033) (note.md).

[Mark 6:53](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">mar 6:53</span></span>

The land of Gennesaret - This country lay on the coast of the sea of
Galilee: it is described by Josephus as being exceedingly pleasant and
fertile. It had its name of Gennesaret from גן, gen, a garden, and סר
sar, a prince, either because the king had a garden there, or because of
its great fertility.

[Mark 6:54](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#054.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">mar 6:54</span></span>

They knew him - Επιγνοντες, They recollected him; for he had before
preached and wrought miracles in different places of the same country.

[Mark 6:56](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#056.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">mar 6:56</span></span>

Villages - Probably small towns near cities.

Country - Villages at a distance from cities and large public towns. See
the notes on [Mat 14:34-36](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#034) (note.md).

Christ went about doing good - he confined his ministry and miracles to
no place - wherever he went, they stood in need of his help; and
whenever they required his assistance, they had it granted immediately.
Our Lord's conduct, in these respects, is a perfect pattern for every
preacher of his Gospel.
