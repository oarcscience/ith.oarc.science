### [Genesis Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 22:0</span></span>

The faith and obedience of Abraham put to a most extraordinary test,
[Gen 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#001.md). He is commanded to offer
his beloved son Isaac for a burnt-offering, [Gen
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#002.md). He prepares, with the utmost
promptitude, to accomplish the will of God, [Gen
22:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#003.md). Affecting speech of Isaac,
[Gen 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#007.md); and Abraham's answer, [Gen
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#008.md). Having arrived at mount Moriah
he prepares to sacrifice his son, [Gen
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#009.md), [Gen
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#010.md); and is prevented by an angel of
the Lord, [Gen 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#011.md), [Gen
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#012.md). A ram is offered in the stead
of Isaac, [Gen 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#013.md); and the place is
named Jehovah-jireh, [Gen 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#014.md). The
angel of the Lord calls to Abraham a second time, [Gen
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#015.md); and, in the most solemn manner,
he is assured of innumerable blessings in the multiplication and
prosperity of his seed, [Gen 22:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#016.md).
Abraham returns and dwells at Beer-sheba, [Gen
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#019.md); hears that his brother Nahor
has eight children by his wife Milcah, [Gen
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#020.md); their names, [Gen
22:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#021.md); and four by his concubine
Reumah, [Gen 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#024.md).

[Genesis 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 22:1</span></span>

God did tempt Abraham - The original here is very emphatic: והאלהים נסה
את אברהם vehaelohim nissah eth Abraham, "And the Elohim he tried this
Abraham;" God brought him into such circumstances as exercised and
discovered his faith, love, and obedience. Though the word tempt, from
tento, signifies no more than to prove or try, yet as it is now
generally used to imply a solicitation to evil, in which way God never
tempts any man, it would be well to avoid it here. The Septuagint used
the word επειρασε, which signifies tried, pierced through; and Symmachus
translates the Hebrew נסה nissah by εδοξαζεν, God glorified Abraham, or
rendered him illustrious, supposing the word to be the same with נס nas,
which signifies to glister with light, whence נס nes, an ensign or
banner displayed. Thus then, according to him, the words should be
understood: "God put great honor on Abraham by giving him this
opportunity of showing to all successive ages the nature and efficacy of
an unshaken faith in the power, goodness, and truth of God." The Targum
of Jonathan ben Uzziel paraphrases the place thus: "And it happened that
Isaac and Ishmael contended, and Ishmael said, I ought to be my father's
heir, because I am his first-born; but Isaac said, It is more proper
that I should be my father's heir, because I am the son of Sarah his
wife, and thou art only the son of Hagar, my mother's slave. Then
Ishmael answered, I am more righteous than thou, because I was
circumcised when I was thirteen years of age, and if I had chosen, I
could have prevented my circumcision; but thou wert circumcised when
thou wert but eight days old, and if thou hadst had knowledge, thou
wouldst probably not have suffered thyself to be circumcised. Then Isaac
answered and said, Behold, I am now thirty-six years old, and if the
holy and blessed God should require all my members, I would freely
surrender them. These words were immediately heard before the Lord of
the universe, and מימרא דיי meimera daiya, the Word of the Lord, did try
Abraham." I wish once for all to remark, though the subject has been
referred to before, that the Chaldee term מימרא meimera, which we
translate word, is taken personally in some hundreds of places in the
Targums. When the author, Jonathan, speaks of the Divine Being as doing
or saying any thing, he generally represents him as performing the whole
by his meimera, which he appears to consider, not as a speech or word
spoken, but as a person quite distinct from the Most High. St. John uses
the word λογος in precisely the same sense with the Targumists, [Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001) (note.md); see the notes there, and
see before on [Gen 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#022) (note.md), and
[Gen 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#001) (note.md).

[Genesis 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 22:2</span></span>

Take now thy son - Bishop Warburton's observations on this passage are
weighty and important. "The order in which the words are placed in the
original gradually increases the sense, and raises the passions higher
and higher: Take now thy son, (rather, take I beseech thee נא na), thine
only son whom thou lovest, even Isaac. Jarchi imagines this minuteness
was to preclude any doubt in Abraham. Abraham desired earnestly to be
let into the mystery of redemption; and God, to instruct him in the
infinite extent of the Divine goodness to mankind, who spared not his
own Son, but delivered him up for us all, let Abraham feel by experience
what it was to lose a beloved son, the son born miraculously when Sarah
was past child-bearing, as Jesus was miraculously born of a virgin. The
duration, too, of the action, [Gen
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#004.md), was the same as that between
Christ's death and resurrection, both which are designed to be
represented in it; and still farther not only the final archetypical
sacrifice of the Son of God was figured in the command to offer Isaac,
but the intermediate typical sacrifice in the Mosaic economy was
represented by the permitted sacrifice of the ram offered up, [Gen
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#013.md), instead of Isaac." See Dodd.

Only son - All that he had by Sarah his legal wife.

The land of Moriah - This is supposed to mean all the mountains of
Jerusalem, comprehending Mount Gihon or Calvary, the mount of Sion and
of Acra. As Mount Calvary is the highest ground to the west, and the
mount of the temple is the lowest of the mounts, Mr. Mann conjectures
that it was upon this mount Abraham offered up Isaac, which is well
known to be the same mount on which our blessed Lord was crucified.
Beer-sheba, where Abraham dwelt, is about forty-two miles distant from
Jerusalem, and it is not to be wondered at that Abraham, Isaac, the two
servants, and the ass laden with wood for the burnt-offering, did not
reach this place till the third day; see [Gen
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#004.md).

[Genesis 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 22:3</span></span>

Two of his young men - Eliezer and Ishmael, according to the Targum.

Clave the wood - Small wood, fig and palm, proper for a burnt-offering -
Targum.

[Genesis 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 22:4</span></span>

The third day - "As the number Seven," says Mr. Ainsworth, "is of
especial use in Scripture because of the Sabbath day, [Gen
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#002.md), so Three is a mystical number
because of Christ's rising from the dead the third day, [Mat
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#023.md); [Co1
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#004.md); as he was crucified the third
hour after noon, [Mar 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#025.md) : and
Isaac, as he was a figure of Christ, in being the only son of his
father, and not spared but offered for a sacrifice, [Rom
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#032.md), so in sundry particulars he
resembled our Lord: the third day Isaac was to be offered up, so it was
the third day in which Christ also was to be perfected, [Luk
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#032.md); Isaac carried the wood for the
burnt-offering, [Gen 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#006.md), so Christ
carried the tree whereon he died, [Joh
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#017.md); the binding of Isaac, [Gen
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#009.md), was also typical, so Christ was
bound, [Mat 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#002.md).

"In the following remarkable cases this number also occurs. Moses
desired to go three days' journey in the wilderness to sacrifice, [Exo
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#003.md); and they traveled three days in
it before they found water, [Exo
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#022.md); and three days' journey the ark
of the covenant went before them, to search out a resting place, [Num
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#033.md); by the third day the people
were to be ready to receive God's law, [Exo
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#011.md); and after three days to pass
over Jordan into Canaan, [Jos 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#014.md);
the third day Esther put on the apparel of the kingdom, [Est
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#001.md); on the third day Hezekiah, being
recovered from his illness, went up to the house of the Lord, [Kg2
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#005.md); on the third day, the prophet
said, God will raise us up and we shall live before him, [Hos
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#002.md); and on the third day, as well as
on the seventh, the unclean person was to purify himself, [Num
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#012.md) : with many other memorable
things which the Scripture speaks concerning the third day, and not
without mystery. See [Gen 40:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#012.md), [Gen
40:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#013.md); [Gen
42:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#017.md), [Gen
42:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#018.md); [Jon
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#017.md); [Jos
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#016.md); unto which we may add a Jew's
testimony in Bereshith Rabba, in a comment on this place: There are many
Three Days mentioned in the Holy Scripture, of which one is the
resurrection of the Messiah." - Ainsworth.

Saw the place afar off - He knew the place by seeing the cloud of glory
smoking on the top of the mountain - Targum.

[Genesis 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 22:5</span></span>

I and the lad will go and come again - How could Abraham consistently
with truth say this, when he knew he was going to make his son a
burnt-offering? The apostle answers for him: By faith Abraham, when he
was tried, offered up Isaac - accounting that God was able to raise him
up even from the dead, from whence also he received him in a figure,
[Heb 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#017.md), [Heb
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#019.md). He knew that previously to the
birth of Isaac both he and his wife were dead to all the purposes of
procreation; that his birth was a kind of life from the dead; that the
promise of God was most positive, In Isaac shall thy seed be called,
[Gen 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#012.md); that this promise could
not fail; that it was his duty to obey the command of his Maker; and
that it was as easy for God to restore him to life after he had been a
burnt-offering, as it was for him to give him life in the beginning.
Therefore he went fully purposed to offer his son, and yet confidently
expecting to have him restored to life again. We will go yonder and
worship - perform a solemn act of devotion which God requires, and come
again to you.

[Genesis 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 22:6</span></span>

Took the wood - and laid it upon Isaac - Probably the mountain-top to
which they were going was too difficult to be ascended by the ass;
therefore either the father or the son must carry the wood, and it was
most becoming in the latter.

[Genesis 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 22:7</span></span>

Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb - Nothing can be
conceived more tender, affectionate, and affecting, than the question of
the son and the reply of the father on this occasion. A paraphrase would
spoil it; nothing can be added without injuring those expressions of
affectionate submission on the one hand, and dignified tenderness and
simplicity on the other.

[Genesis 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 22:8</span></span>

My son, God will provide himself a lamb - Here we find the same obedient
unshaken faith for which this pattern of practical piety was ever
remarkable. But we must not suppose that this was the language merely of
faith and obedience; the patriarch spoke prophetically, and referred to
that Lamb of God which He had provided for himself, who in the fullness
of time should take away the sin of the world, and of whom Isaac was a
most expressive type. All the other lambs which had been offered from
the foundation of the world had been such as Men chose and Men offered;
but This was the Lamb which God had provided - emphatically, The Lamb Of
God.

[Genesis 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 22:9</span></span>

And bound Isaac his son - If the patriarch had not been upheld by the
conviction that he was doing the will of God, and had he not felt the
most perfect confidence that his son should be restored even from the
dead, what agony must his heart have felt at every step of the journey,
and through all the circumstances of this extraordinary business? What
must his affectionate heart have felt at the questions asked by his
innocent and amiable son? What must he have suffered while building the
altar, laying on the wood, binding his lovely son, placing him on the
wood, taking the knife, and stretching out his hand to slay the child of
his hopes? Every view we take of the subject interests the heart, and
exalts the character of this father of the faithful. But has the
character of Isaac been duly considered? Is not the consideration of his
excellence lost in the supposition that he was too young to enter
particularly into a sense of his danger, and too feeble to have made any
resistance, had he been unwilling to submit? Josephus supposes that
Isaac was now twenty-five, (see the chronology on [Gen
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#001) (note).md); some rabbins that he was
thirty-six; but it is more probable that he was now about thirty-three,
the age at which his great Antitype was offered up; and on this medium I
have ventured to construct the chronology, of which I think it necessary
to give this notice to the reader. Allowing him to be only twenty-five,
he might have easily resisted; for can it be supposed that an old man of
at least one hundred and twenty-five years of age could have bound,
without his consent, a young man in the very prime and vigor of life? In
this case we cannot say that the superior strength of the father
prevailed, but the piety, filial affection, and obedience of the son
yielded. All this was most illustriously typical of Christ. In both
cases the father himself offers up his only-begotten son, and the father
himself binds him on the wood or to the cross; in neither case is the
son forced to yield, but yields of his own accord; in neither case is
the life taken away by the hand of violence; Isaac yields himself to the
knife, Jesus lays down his life for the sheep.

[Genesis 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 22:11</span></span>

The angel of the Lord - The very person who was represented by this
offering; the Lord Jesus, who calls himself Jehovah, [Gen
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#016.md), and on his own authority renews
the promises of the covenant. He was ever the great Mediator between God
and man. See this point proved, [Gen
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#007) (note.md).

[Genesis 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 22:12</span></span>

Lay not thine hand upon the lad - As Isaac was to be the representative
of Jesus Christ's real sacrifice, it was sufficient for this purpose
that in his own will, and the will of his father, the purpose of the
immolation was complete. Isaac was now fully offered both by his father
and by himself. The father yields up the son, the son gives up his life;
on both sides, as far as will and purpose could go, the sacrifice was
complete. God simply spares the father the torture of putting the knife
to his son's throat. Now was the time when it might properly be said,
"Sacrifice, and offering, and burnt-offering, and sacrifice for sin thou
wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure in them: then said the Angel of the
Covenant, Lo! I come to do thy will, O God." Lay not thy hand upon the
lad; an irrational creature will serve for the purpose of a
representative sacrifice, from this till the fullness of time. But
without this most expressive representation of the father offering his
beloved, only-begotten son, what reference can such sacrifices be
considered to have to the great event of the incarnation and crucifixion
of Christ? Abraham, the most dignified, the most immaculate of all the
patriarchs; Isaac, the true pattern of piety to God and filial
obedience, may well represent God the Father so loving the world as to
give his only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ, to die for the sin of man. But
the grand circumstances necessary to prefigure these important points
could not be exhibited through the means of any or of the whole brute
creation. The whole sacrificial system of the Mosaic economy had a
retrospective and prospective view, referring From the sacrifice of
Isaac To the sacrifice of Christ; in the first the dawning of the Sun of
righteousness was seen; in the latter, his meridian splendor and glory.
Taken in this light (and this is the only light in which it should be
viewed) Abraham offering his son Isaac is one of the most important
facts and most instructive histories in the whole Old Testament. See
farther on this subject, [Gen 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#002.md)
(note).

[Genesis 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 22:14</span></span>

Jehovah - jireh - יהוה יראה Yehovah-yireh, literally interpreted in the
margin, The Lord will see; that is, God will take care that every thing
shall be done that is necessary for the comfort and support of them who
trust in him: hence the words are usually translated, The Lord will
provide; so our translators, [Gen
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#008.md), אלהים יראה Elohim yireh, God
will provide; because his eye ever affects his heart, and the wants he
sees his hand is ever ready to supply. But all this seems to have been
done under a Divine Impulse, and the words to have been spoken
prophetically; hence Houbigant and some others render the words thus:
Dominus videbitur, the Lord shall be seen; and this translation the
following clause seems to require, As it is said to this day, בהר יהוה
יראה behar Yehovah yeraeh, On This Mount The Lord Shall Be Seen. From
this it appears that the sacrifice offered by Abraham was understood to
be a representative one, and a tradition was kept up that Jehovah should
be seen in a sacrificial way on this mount. And this renders the opinion
stated on [Gen 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#001.md) more than
probable, viz., that Abraham offered Isaac on that very mountain on
which, in the fullness of time, Jesus suffered. See Bishop Warburton.

[Genesis 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 22:16</span></span>

By myself have I sworn - So we find that the person who was called the
angel of the Lord is here called Jehovah; See note on [Gen
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#002.md). An oath or an appeal to God is,
among men, an end to strife; as God could swear by no greater, he sware
by himself: being willing more abundantly, says the apostle, to show
unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, he confirmed
it by an oath, that two immutable things, (his Promise and his Oath), in
which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong
consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before
us. See [Heb 6:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#013.md).

[Genesis 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 22:17</span></span>

Shall possess the gate of his enemies - Instead of gate the Septuagint
have πολεις, cities; but as there is a very near resemblance between
πολεις, cities, and πυλας, gates, the latter might have been the
original reading in the Septuagint, though none of the MSS. now
acknowledge it. By the gates may be meant all the strength, whether
troops, counsels, or fortified cities of their enemies. So [Mat
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018.md) : On this rock I will build my
Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it - the
counsels, stratagems, and powers of darkness shall not be able to
prevail against or overthrow the true Church of Christ; and possibly our
Lord had this promise to Abraham and his spiritual posterity in view,
when he spoke these words.

[Genesis 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 22:18</span></span>

And in thy seed, etc. - We have the authority of St. Paul, [Gal
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#008.md), [Gal
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016.md), [Gal
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#018.md), to restrain this to our blessed
Lord, who was The Seed through whom alone all God's blessings of
providence, mercy, grace, and glory, should be conveyed to the nations
of the earth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 22:20</span></span>

Behold, Milcah, she hath also borne children unto thy brother - This
short history seems introduced solely for the purpose of preparing the
reader for the transactions related Genesis 24, and to show that the
providence of God was preparing, in one of the branches of the family of
Abraham, a suitable spouse for his son Isaac.

[Genesis 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 22:21</span></span>

Huz - He is supposed to have peopled the land of Uz or Ausitis, in
Arabia Deserta, the country of Job.

Buz his brother - From this person Elihu the Buzite, one of the friends
of Job, is thought to have descended.

Kemuel the father of Aram - Kamouel πατερα Συρων, the father of the
Syrians, according to the Septuagint. Probably the Kamiletes, a Syrian
tribe to the westward of the Euphrates are meant; they are mentioned by
Strabo.

His concubine - We borrow this word from the Latin compound concubina,
from con, together, and cubo, to lie, and apply it solely to a woman
cohabiting with a man without being legally married. The Hebrew word is
פילגש pilegesh, which is also a compound term, contracted, according to
Parkhurst, from פלג palag, to divide or share, and נגש nagash, to
approach; because the husband, in the delicate phrase of the Hebrew
tongue, approaches the concubine, and shares the bed, etc., of the real
wife with her. The pilegesh or concubine, (from which comes the Greek
παλλακη pallake, and also the Latin pellex), in Scripture, is a kind of
secondary wife, not unlawful in the patriarchal times; though the
progeny of such could not inherit. The word is not used in the
Scriptures in that disagreeable sense in which we commonly understand
it. Hagar was properly the concubine or pilegesh of Abraham, and thus
annuente Deo, and with his wife's consent. Keturah, his second wife, is
called a concubine, [Gen 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#015.md); [Ch1
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#032.md); and Pilhah and Zilhah were
concubines to Jacob, [Gen 35:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#022.md). After
the patriarchal times many eminent men had concubines, viz., Caleb, [Ch1
2:46](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#046.md), [Ch1
2:48](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#048.md); Manasses, [Ch1
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#014.md); Gideon, [Jdg
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#031.md); Saul, [Sa2
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#007.md); David, [Sa2
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#013.md); Solomon,[Kg2
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#003.md); and Rehoboam, [Ch2
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#021.md). The pilegesh, therefore,
differed widely from a prostitute; and however unlawful under the New
Testament, was not so under the Old.

From this chapter a pious mind may collect much useful instruction. From
the trial of Abraham we again see, 1. That God may bring his followers
into severe straits and difficulties, that they may have the better
opportunity of both knowing and showing their own faith and obedience;
and that he may seize on those occasions to show them the abundance of
his mercy, and thus confirm them in righteousness all their days. There
is a foolish saying among some religious people, which cannot be too
severely reprobated: Untried grace is no grace. On the contrary, there
may be much grace, though God, for good reasons, does not think proper
for a time to put it to any severe trial or proof. But grace is
certainly not fully known but in being called to trials of severe and
painful obedience. But as all the gifts of God should be used, (and they
are increased and strengthened by exercise), it would be unjust to deny
trials and exercises to grace, as this would be to preclude it from the
opportunities of being strengthened and increased. 2. The offering up of
Isaac is used by several religious people in a sort of metaphorical way,
to signify their easily-besetting sins, beloved idols, etc. But this is
a most reprehensible abuse of the Scripture. It is both insolent and
wicked to compare some abominable lust or unholy affection to the
amiable and pious youth who, for his purity and excellence, was deemed
worthy to prefigure the sacrifice of the Son of God. To call our vile
passions and unlawful attachments by the name of our Isaac is
unpardonable; and to talk of sacrificing such to God is downright
blasphemy. Such sayings as these appear to be legitimated by long use;
but we should be deeply and scrupulously careful not to use any of the
words of God in any sense in which he has not spoken them. If, in the
course of God's providence, a parent is called to give up to death an
amiable, only son, then there is a parallel in the case; and it may be
justly said, if pious resignation fill the parent's mind, such a person,
like Abraham, has been called to give his Isaac back to God.

Independently of the typical reference to this transaction, there are
two points which seem to be recommended particularly to our notice. 1.
The astonishing faith and prompt obedience of the father. 2. The
innocence, filial respect, and passive submission of the son. Such a
father and such a son were alone worthy of each other.
