### [Isaiah Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 5:0</span></span>

This chapter begins with representing, in a beautiful parable, the
tender care of God for his people, and their unworthy returns for his
goodness, [Isa 5:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001.md). The parable or
allegory is then dropped; and the prophet, in plain terms, reproves and
threatens them for their wickedness; particularly for their
covetousness, [Isa 5:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#008.md);
intemperance, [Isa 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#011.md); and
inattention to the warnings of Providence, [Isa
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#012.md). Then follows an enumeration of
judgments as the necessary consequence. Captivity and famine appear with
all their horrors, [Isa 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#013.md). Hades,
or the grave, like a ravenous monster, opens wide its jaws, and swallows
down its myriads, [Isa 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#014.md). Distress
lays hold on all ranks, [Isa 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#015.md); and
God is glorified in the execution of his judgments, [Isa
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#016.md); till the whole place is left
desolate, a place for the flocks to range in, [Isa
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#017.md). The prophet then pauses; and
again resumes his subject, reproving them for several other sins, and
threatening them with woes and vengeance, [Isa
5:18-24](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#018.md); after which he sums up the
whole of his awful denunciation in a very lofty and spirited epiphonema
or conclusion. The God of armies, having hitherto corrected to no
purpose, is represented with inimitable majesty, as only giving a hist,
and a swarm of nations hasten to his standard, [Isa
5:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#025.md). Upon a guilty race, unpitied
by heaven or by earth, they execute their commission; and leave the land
desolate and dark, without one ray of comfort to cheer the horrid gloom,
[Isa 5:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#028.md).

This chapter likewise stands single and alone, unconnected with the
preceding or following. The subject of it is nearly the same with that
of the first chapter. It is a general reproof of the Jews for their
wickedness; but it exceeds that chapter in force, in severity, in
variety, and elegance; and it adds a more express declaration of
vengeance by the Babylonian invasion.

[Isaiah 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 5:1</span></span>

Now will I sing to my well-beloved a song of my beloved "Let me sing now
a song," etc. - A MS., respectable for its antiquity, adds the word שיר
shir, a song, after נא na; which gives so elegant a turn to the sentence
by the repetition of it in the next member, and by distinguishing the
members so exactly in the style and manner in the Hebrew poetical
composition, that I am much inclined to think it genuine.

A song of my beloved "A song of loves" - דודי dodey, for דודים dodim:
status constructus pro absoluto, as the grammarians say, as [Mic
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#016.md); [Lam
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#014.md), [Lam
3:66](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#066.md), so Archbishop Secker. Or rather,
in all these and the like cases, a mistake of the transcribers, by not
observing a small stroke, which in many MSS., is made to supply the מ
mem, of the plural, thus, דודי dodi. שירת דודים shirath dodim is the
same with שיר ידידת shir yedidoth, [Psa
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#001.md). In this way of understanding it
we avoid the great impropriety of making the author of the song, and the
person to whom it is addressed, to be the same.

In a very fruitful hill "On a high and fruitful hill" - Hebrew בקרן בן
שמן bekeren ben shamen, "on a horn the son of oil." The expression is
highly descriptive and poetical. "He calls the land of Israel a horn,
because it is higher than all lands; as the horn is higher than the
whole body; and the son of oil, because it is said to be a land flowing
with milk and honey." - Kimchi on the place. The parts of animals are,
by an easy metaphor, applied to parts of the earth, both in common and
poetical language. A promontory is called a cape or head; the Turks call
it a nose. "Dorsum immane mari summo;" Virgil, a back, or ridge of
rocks: -

"Hanc latus angustum jam se cogentis in arctum

Hesperiae tenuem producit in aequora linguam,

Adriacas flexis claudit quae cornibus undas."

Lucan, 2:612, of Brundusium, i.e., Βρεντεσιον, which, in the ancient
language of that country, signifies stag's head, says Strabo. A horn is
a proper and obvious image for a mountain or mountainous country.
Solinus, cap. viii., says, "Italiam, ubi longius processerit, in cornua
duo scindi;" that is, the high ridge of the Alps, which runs through the
whole length of it, divides at last into two ridges, one going through
Calabria, the other through the country of the Brutii. "Cornwall is
called by the inhabitants in the British tongue Kernaw, as lessening by
degrees like a horn, running out into promontories like so many horns.
For the Britons call a horn corn, in the plural kern." - Camden. "And
Sammes is of opinion, that the country had this name originally from the
Phoenicians, who traded hither for tin; keren, in their language, being
a horn." - Gibson.

Here the precise idea seems to be that of a high mountain standing by
itself; "vertex montis, aut pars montis ad aliis divisa;" which
signification, says I. H. Michaelis, Bibl. Hallens., Not. in loc., the
word has in Arabic.

Judea was in general a mountainous country, whence Moses sometimes calls
it The Mountain, "Thou shalt plant them in the mountain of thine
inheritance;" [Exo 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#017.md). "I pray
thee, let me go over, and see the good land beyond Jordan; that goodly
mountain, and Lebanon;" [Deu 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#025.md). And
in a political and religious view it was detached and separated from all
the nations round it. Whoever has considered the descriptions given of
Mount Tabor, (see Reland, Palaestin.; Eugene Roger, Terre Sainte, p.
64), and the views of it which are to be seen in books of travels,
(Maundrell, p. 114; Egmont and Heyman, vol. ii., p. 25; Thevenot, vol.
i., p. 429), its regular conic form rising singly in a plain to a great
height, from a base small in proportion, and its beauty and fertility to
the very top, will have a good idea of "a horn the son of oil;" and will
perhaps be induced to think that the prophet took his image from that
mountain.

[Isaiah 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 5:2</span></span>

And gathered out the stones "And he cleared it from the stones" - This
was agreeable to the husbandry: "Saxa, summa parte terrae, et vites et
arbores laeduct; ima parte refrigerant;" Columell. de arb. 3: "Saxosum
facile est expedire lectione lapidum;" Id. 2:2. "Lapides, qui supersunt,
\[al. insuper sunt\], hieme rigent, aestate fervescunt; idcirco satis,
arbustis, et vitibus nocent;" Pallad. 1:6. A piece of ground thus
cleared of the stones Persius, in his hard way of metaphor, calls
"exossatus ager," an unboned field; Sat. 6:52.

The choicest vine "Sorek" - Many of the ancient interpreters, the
Septuagint, Aquila, and Theod., have retained this word as a proper
name; I think very rightly. Sorek was a valley lying between Ascalon and
Gaza, and running far up eastward in the tribe of Judah. Both Ascalon
and Gaza were anciently famous for wine; the former is mentioned as such
by Alexander Trallianus; the latter by several authors, quoted by
Reland, Palaest., p. 589 and 986. And it seems that the upper part of
the valley of Sorek, and that of Eshcol, where the spies gathered the
single cluster of grapes, which they were obliged to bear between two
upon a staff, being both near to Hebron were in the same neighborhood,
and that all this part of the country abounded with rich vineyards.
Compare [Num 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#022.md), [Num
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#023.md); [Jdg
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#003.md), [Jdg
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#004.md). P. Nau supposes Eshcol and Sorek
to be only different names for the same valley. Voyage Noveau de la
Terre Sainte, lib. iv., chap. 18. See likewise De Lisle's posthumous map
of the Holy Land. Paris, 1763. See Bochart, Hieroz. ii., Colossians 725.
Thevenot, i, p. 406. Michaelis (note on [Jdg
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#004) (note), German translation.md)
thinks it probable, from some circumstances of the history there given,
that Sorek was in the tribe of Judah, not in the country of the
Philistines.

The vine of Sorek was known to the Israelites, being mentioned by Moses,
[Gen 49:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#011.md), before their coming out of
Egypt. Egypt was not a wine country. "Throughout this country there are
no wines;" Sandys, p. 101. At least in very ancient times they had none.
Herodotus, 2:77, says it had no vines and therefore used an artificial
wine made of barley. That is not strictly true, for the vines of Egypt
are spoken of in Scripture, [Psa
78:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#047.md); [Psa
105:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#033.md); and see [Gen
40:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#011.md), by which it should seem that
they drank only the fresh juice pressed from the grape, which was called
οινος αμπελινος; Herodot., 2:37. But they had no large vineyards, nor
was the country proper for them, being little more than one large plain,
annually overflowed by the Nile. The Mareotic in later times is, I
think, the only celebrated Egyptian wine which we meet with in history.
The vine was formerly, as Hasselquist tells us it is now, "cultivated in
Egypt for the sake of eating the grapes, not for wine, which is brought
from Candia," etc. "They were supplied with wine from Greece, and
likewise from Phoenicia," Herodot., 3:6. The vine and the wine of Sorek
therefore, which lay near at hand for importation into Egypt, must in
all probability have been well known to the Israelites, when they
sojourned there. There is something remarkable in the manner in which
Moses, [Gen 49:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#011.md), makes mention of
it, which, for want of considering this matter, has not been attended
to; it is in Jacob's prophecy of the future prosperity of the tribe of
Judah: -

"Binding his foal to the vine,

And his ass's colt to his own sorek;

He washeth his raiment in wine,

And his cloak in the blood of grapes."

I take the liberty of rendering שרקה sorekah, for שרקו soreko, his
sorek, as the Masoretes do by pointing עירה iroh, for עירו iro, his
foal. עיר ir, might naturally enough appear in the feminine form; but it
is not at all probable that שרק sorek ever should. By naming
particularly the vine of Sorek, and as the vine belonging to Judah, the
prophecy intimates the very part of the country which was to fall to the
lot of that tribe. Sir John Chardin says, "that at Casbin, a city of
Persia, they turn their cattle into the vineyards after the vintage, to
browse on the vines." He speaks also of vines in that country so large
that he could hardly compass the trunks of them with his arms. Voyages,
tom. iii., p. 12, 12mo. This shows that the ass might be securely bound
to the vine, and without danger of damaging the tree by browsing on it.

And built a tower in the midst of it - Our Savior, who has taken the
general idea of one of his parables, [Mat
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033.md); [Mar
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#001.md), from this of Isaiah, has
likewise inserted this circumstance of building a tower; which is
generally explained by commentators as designed for the keeper of the
vineyard to watch and defend the fruits. But for this purpose it was
usual to make a little temporary hut, ([Isa
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008).md), which might serve for the short
season while the fruit was ripening, and which was removed afterwards.
The tower therefore should rather mean a building of a more permanent
nature and use; the farm, as we may call it, of the vineyard, containing
all the offices and implements, and the whole apparatus necessary for
the culture of the vineyard, and the making of the wine. To which image
in the allegory, the situation the manner of building, the use, and the
whole service of the temple, exactly answered. And so the Chaldee
paraphrast very rightly expounds it: Et statui eos (Israelitas) ut
plantam vineae selectae et aedificavi Sanctuarium meum in medio illorum.
"And I have appointed the Israelites as a plant of a chosen vine, and I
have built my sanctuary in the midst of them." So also Hieron. in loc.
Aedificavit quoque turrim in medio ejus; templum videlicet in media
civitate. "He built also a tower in the midst of it, viz., his own
temple in the midst of the city." That they have still such towers or
buildings for use or pleasure, in their gardens in the East, see
Harmer's Observations, 2 p. 241.

And also made a wine-press therein. "And hewed out a lake therein" -
This image also our Savior has preserved in his parable. יקב yekeb; the
Septuagint render it here προληνιον, and in four other places ὑποληνιον,
[Isa 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#010.md); [Joe
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#013.md); [Hag
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#017.md); [Zac
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#010.md), I think more properly; and this
latter word St. Mark uses. It means not the wine-press itself, or
calcatorium, which is called גת gath, or פורה purah; but what the Romans
called lacus, the lake; the large open place or vessel, which by a
conduit or spout received the must from the wine-press. In very hot
countries it was perhaps necessary, or at least very convenient, to have
the lake under ground, or in a cave hewed out of the side of the rock,
for coolness, that the heat might not cause too great a fermentation,
and sour the must. Vini confectio instituitur in cella, vel intimae
domus camera quadam a ventorum ingressu remota. Kempfer, of Shiras wine.
Amaen. Exot. p. 376. For the wind, to which that country is subject,
would injure the wine. "The wine-presses in Persia," says Sir John
Chardin, "are formed by making hollow places in the ground, lined with
masons' work." Harmer's Observations, i., p. 392. See a print of one in
Kempfer, p. 377.

Nonnus describes at large Bacchus hollowing the inside of a rock, and
hewing out a place for the wine-press, or rather the lake: -

Και σκοπελους ελαχηνε· πεδοσκαφεος δε σιδηρου

Θηγαλεῃ γλωχινι μυχον κοιληνατο πετρης·

Λειηνας δε μετωπα βαθυνομενων κενεωνων

Αφρον \[f. ακρον\] εΰστραφυλοιο τυπον ποιησατο λενου.

Dionysiac. lib. xii., 50:331.

"He pierced the rock; and with the sharpen'd tool

Of steel well-temper'd scoop'd its inmost depth:

Then smooth'd the front, and form'd the dark recess

In just dimensions for the foaming lake."

And he looked "And he expected" - Jeremiah, [Jer
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#021.md), uses the same image, and applies
it to the same purpose, in an elegant paraphrase of this part of
Isaiah's parable, in his flowing and plaintive manner: -

"But I planted thee a sorek, a scion perfectly genuine: How then art
thou changed, and become to me the degenerate shoots of the strange
vine!"

Wild grapes "poisonous berries" - באשים beushim, not merely useless,
unprofitable grapes, such as wild grapes; but grapes offensive to the
smell, noxious, poisonous. By the force and intent of the allegory, to
good grapes ought to be opposed fruit of a dangerous and pernicious
quality; as, in the explication of it, to judgment is opposed tyranny,
and to righteousness, oppression. גפן gephen, the vine, is a common name
or genus, including several species under it; and Moses, to distinguish
the true vine, or that from which wine is made, from the rest. calls it,
[Num 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#004.md), גפן היין gephen haiyayin,
the wine-vine. Some of the other sorts were of a poisonous quality, as
appears from the story related among the miraculous acts of Elisha, [Kg2
4:39-41](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#039.md). "And one went out into the
field to gather potherbs; and he found a Seld vine, and he gathered from
it wild fruit, his lapful; and he went and shred them into the pot of
pottage, for they knew them not. And they poured it out for the men to
eat: and it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they
cried out and said, There is death in the pot, O man of God; and they
could not eat of it. And he said, Bring meal, (leg. קחו kechu, nine
MSS., one edition), and he threw it into the pot. And he said, Pour out
for the people, that they may eat. And there was nothing hurtful in the
pot."

From some such sorts of poisonous fruits of the grape kind Moses has
taken these strong and highly poetical images, with which he has set
forth the future corruption and extreme degeneracy of the Israelites, in
an allegory which has a near relation, both in its subject and imagery,
to this of Isaiah: [Deu 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#032.md), [Deu
32:33](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#033.md).

"Their vine is from the vine of Sodom,

And from the fields of Gomorrah:

Their grapes are grapes of gall;

Their clusters are bitter:

Their wine is the poison of dragons,

And the cruel venom of aspics."

"I am inclined to believe," says Hasselquist, "that the prophet here,
[Isa 5:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#002.md), means the hoary
nightshade, solanum incanum; because it is common in Egypt, Palestine,
and the East; and the Arabian name agrees well with it. The Arabs call
it anab el dib, i.e., wolf grapes. The באושים beushim, says Rab. Chai.,
is a well known species of the vine, and the worst of all sorts. The
prophet could not have found a plant more opposite to the vine than
this; for it grows much in the vineyards, and is very pernicious to
them; wherefore they root it out: it likewise resembles a vine by its
shrubby stalk;" Travels, p. 289. See also Michaelis Questions aux
Voyageurs Danois, No. 64.

[Isaiah 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 5:3</span></span>

Inhabitants - ישבי yoshebey, in the plural number; three MSS., (two
ancient), and so likewise the Septuagint and Vulgate.

[Isaiah 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 5:6</span></span>

There shall come up briers and thorns "The thorn shall spring up in it"
- One MS. has בשמיר beshamir. The true reading seems to be בו שמור bo
shamir, which is confirmed by the Septuagint, Syriac, and Vulgate.

[Isaiah 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 5:7</span></span>

And he looked for judgment - The paronomasia, or play on the words, in
this place, is very remarkable; mishpat, mishpach, tsedakah, tseakah.
There are many examples of it in the other prophets, but Isaiah seems
peculiarly fond of it. See [Isa 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#006.md),
[Isa 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#017.md), [Isa
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#007.md), [Isa
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#001.md), [Isa
57:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#006.md), [Isa
61:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003.md), [Isa
65:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#011.md), [Isa
65:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#012.md). Rabbi David Kimchi has noticed
the paronomasia here: he expected משפט mishpat, judgment, but behold
משפח mishpach, oppression; he expected צדקה tsedakah, righteousness, but
behold צעקה tseakah, a cry. The rabbins esteem it a great beauty; their
term for it is צחות הלשון tsachoth haltashon, elegance of language.

Oppression "tyranny" - משפח mishpach, from שפח shaphach, servum fecit,
Arab. Houbigant: שפחה shiphchah is serva, a handmaid or female slave.
משפח mispach, eighteen MSS.

[Isaiah 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 5:8</span></span>

Wo unto them that - lay field to field "You who lay field unto field" -
Read תקריבו takribu, in the second person; to answer to the verb
following. So Vulgate.

[Isaiah 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 5:9</span></span>

In mine ears. "To mine ear" - The sentence in the Hebrew text seems to
be imperfect in this place; as likewise in [Isa
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#014) (note.md), where the very same
sense seems to be required as here. See the note there; and compare [Sa1
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#015) (note.md). In this place the
Septuagint supply the word ηκουσθη, and the Syriac אשתמע eshtama,
auditus est Jehovah in auribus meis, i.e., נגלה niglah, as in [Isa
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#014.md).

Many houses - This has reference to what was said in the preceding
verse: "In vain are ye so intent upon joining house to house, and field
to field; your houses shall be left uninhabited, and your fields shall
become desolate and barren; so that a vineyard of ten acres shall
produce but one bath (not eight gallons) of wine, and the husbandman
shall reap but a tenth part of the seed which he has sown." Kimchi says
this means such an extent of vineyard as would require ten yoke of oxen
to plough in one day.

[Isaiah 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 5:11</span></span>

Wo unto them that rise up early - There is a likeness between this and
the following passage of the prophet Amos, [Amo
6:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#003.md), who probably wrote before
Isaiah. If the latter be the copier, he seems hardly to have equalled
the elegance of the original: -

"Ye that put far away the evil day

And affect the seat of violence;

Who lie upon beds of ivory,

And stretch yourselves upon your couches;

And eat the lambs from the flock,

And calves from the midst of the stall;

Who chant to the sound of the viol,

And like David invent for yourselves instruments of music;

Who quaff wine in large bowls,

And are anointed with the choicest ointments:

But are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph."

Kimchi says, "they consider not the heavens nor their hosts: they pray
not the morning nor the evening prayer unto the Lord."

Follow strong drink - Theodoret and Chrysostom on this place, both
Syrians, and unexceptionable witnesses in what belongs to their own
country, inform us that שכר shechar (σικερα in the Greek of both
Testaments, rendered by us by the general term strong drink) meant
properly palm wine, or date wine, which was and is still much in use in
the Eastern countries. Judea was famous for the abundance and excellence
of its palm trees; and consequently had plenty of this wine. "Fiunt
(vina) et e pomis; primumque e palmis, quo Parthi et Indi utun tur, et
oriens totus: maturarum modio in aquae congiis tribus macerato
expressoque." Plin. lib. 14:19. "Ab his cariotae \[palmae\] maxime
celebrantur; et cibo quidem, sed et succo, uberrimae. Ex quibus
praecipua vina orienti; iniqua capiti, unde porno nomen." Id. 13:9.
Καρος signifies stupefaction: and in Hebrew likewise the wine has its
name from its remarkably inebriating quality.

[Isaiah 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 5:13</span></span>

And their honorable men "And the nobles" - These verses have likewise a
reference to the two preceding. They that indulged in feasting and
drinking shall perish with hunger and thirst; and Hades shall indulge
his appetite as much as they had done, and devour them all. The image is
strong and expressive in the highest degree. [Hab
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#005.md), uses the same image with great
force: - the ambitious and avaricious conqueror.

"Enlargeth his appetite like Hades;

And he is like Death, and will never be satisfied,"

But, in Isaiah, Hades is introduced to much greater advantage, in
person; and placed before our eyes in the form of a ravenous monster,
opening wide his immeasurable jaws, and swallowing them all together:
"Therefore Shoel hath dilated her soul, she hath opened her mouth beyond
limit." Destruction expects more than a common meal, when God visits
Jerusalem for her iniquities. This seems to refer to the ruin brought on
the Jews by the Romans. Our blessed Lord repeats this parable, and
applies it to this very transaction, [Mat
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033.md).

[Isaiah 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 5:17</span></span>

The lambs "And the kids" - גרים gerim, "strangers." The Septuagint read,
more agreeably to the design of the prophet, כרים carim, αρνες, "the
lambs." גדים gedayim, "the kids," Dr. Durell; nearer to the present
reading: and so Archbishop Secker. The meaning is, their luxurious
habitations shall be so entirely destroyed as to become a pasture for
flocks.

After their manner "Without restraint" - כדברם kedobram, secundum duetum
eorum; i.e. suo ipsorum ductu; as their own will shall lead them.

With a cart-rope "As a long cable" - The Septuagint, Aquila, Sym., and
Theod., for בחבלי bechabley, read כחבלי kechahley, ὡς σχοινιῳ, or
σχοινιοις; and the Septuagint, instead of שוא shau, read some other word
signifying long; ὡς σχοινιῳ μακρῳ; and so likewise the Syriac, אריכא
arecha. Houbigant conjectures that the word which the Septuagint had in
their copies was שרוע sarua, which is used [Lev
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#018.md), [Lev
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#023.md), for something in an animal body
superfluous, lengthened beyond its natural measure. And he explains it
of sin added to sin, and one sin drawing on another, till the whole
comes to an enormous length and magnitude; compared to the work of a
rope-maker still increasing and lengthening his rope, with the continued
addition of new materials. "Eos propheta similes facit homini restiario,
qui funem torquet, cannabe addita et contorta, eadem iterans, donec
funem in longum duxerit, neque eum liceat protrahi longius." "An evil
inclination," says Kimchi on this place, from the ancient rabbins, "is
at the beginning like a fine hair-string, but at the finishing like a
thick cart-rope." By a long progression in iniquity, and a continued
accumulation of sin, men arrive at length to the highest degree of
wickedness; bidding open defiance to God, and scoffing at his threatened
judgments, as it is finely expressed in the next verse. The Chaldee
paraphrast explains it in the same manner, of wickedness increasing from
small beginnings, till it arrives to a great magnitude. - L.

I believe neither the rabbins nor Bishop Lowth have hit on the true
meaning of this place, the prophet seems to refer to idol sacrifices.
The victims they offered were splendidly decked out for the sacrifice.
Their horns and hoofs were often gilded, and their heads dressed out
with fillets and garlands. The cords of vanity may refer to the silken
strings by which they were led to the altar, some of which were
unusually thick. The offering for iniquity was adorned with fillets and
garlands; the sin-offering with silken cords, like unto cart-ropes.
Pride, in their acts of humiliation, had the upper hand.

Let the counsel of the Holy One - Tryphiodorus has an expression
something like this: -

\- επει Διος ηλυθε βουλη.

Tryph. Il Excid. 239.

Because the counsel of Jupiter was come.

"This expression, ηλυθε βουλη, is, I believe, something uncommon; but it
is exactly paralleled and explained by a passage in Isaiah, [Isa
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#019.md). The Septuagint has expressed it
in the very same words with Tryphiodorus: και ελθοι ἡ βουλ η του ἁγιου
Ισραηλ, ἱνα γνωμεν." - Merrick's note, ad loc.

The flame "The tongue of fire" - "The flame, because it is in the shape
of a tongue; and so it is called metaphorically." Sal. ben Melec. The
metaphor is so exceedingly obvious, as well as beautiful, that one may
wonder that it has not been more frequently used. Virgil very elegantly
intimates, rather than expresses, the image; -

Ecce levis summo de vertice visus Iuli

Fundere lumen apex; tactuque innoxia molli

Lambere flamma comas, et circum tempora pasci.

Aen. 2:682.

"Strange to relate! from young Iulus' head

A lambent flame arose, which gently spread

Around his brows, and on his temples fed."

And more boldly of Aetna darting out flames from its top: -

Interdumque atram prorumpit ad aethera nubem,

Turbine fumantem piceo, et candente favilla:

Attollitque globos flammarum, et sidera lambit.

Aen. 3:574.

"By turns a pitchy cloud she rolls on high,

By turns hot embers from her entrails fly,

And flakes of mountain flames, that lick the sky."

The disparted tongues, as it were of fire, [Act
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#003.md), which appeared at the descent of
the Holy Spirit, on the apostles, give the same idea; that is, of flames
shooting diversely into pyramidal forms, or points, like tongues. It may
be farther observed that the prophet in this place has given the
metaphor its full force, in applying it to the action of fire in eating
up and devouring whatever comes in its way, like a ravenous animal whose
tongue is principally employed in taking in his food or prey; which
image Moses has strongly exhibited in an expressive comparison: "And
Moab said to the elders of Midian Now shall this collection of people
lick up all that are around about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of
the field," [Num 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#004.md). See also [Kg1
18:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#038.md).

Their root shall be as rottenness - כמק cammak, like mak; whence
probably our word muck, dung, was derived.

The hills did tremble "And the mountains trembled" - Probably referring
to the great earthquakes in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, in or not
long before the time of the prophet himself, recorded as a remarkable
era in the title of the prophecies of Amos., [Amo
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md), and by Zechariah, [Zac
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#005.md).

He will - hiss "He will hist" - "The metaphor is taken from the practice
of those that keep bees, who draw them out of their hives into the
fields, and lead them back again, συρισμασι, by a hiss or a whistle." -
Cyril, on this place; and to the same purpose Theodoret, ib. In [Isa
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#018.md), the metaphor is more apparent,
by being carried farther, where the hostile armies are expressed by the
fly and the bee: -

"Jehovah shall hist the fly That is in the utmost parts of Egypt; And
the bee, that is in the land of Assyria."

On which place see [Deu 1:44](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#044.md); [Psa
118:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#012.md); and God calls the locusts his
great army, [Joe 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#025.md); [Exo
23:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#028.md). See Huet, Quest. Alnet. 2:12.
שרק sharak or shrak, he shall whistle for them, call loud and shrill; he
shall shriek, and they (their enemies) shall come at his call.

With speed - This refers to the [Isa
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#019.md). As the scoffers had challenged
God to make speed, and to hasten his work of vengeance, so now God
assures them that with speed and swiftly it shall come.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">isa 5:27</span></span>

None - among them - Kimchi has well illustrated this continued
exaggeration or hyperbole, as he rightly calls it, to the following
effect: "Through the greatness of their courage they shall not be
fatigued with their march, nor shall they stumble though they march with
the utmost speed: they shall not slumber by day, nor sleep by night;
neither shall they ungird their armor, or put off their sandals to take
their rest. Their arms shall be always in readiness, their arrows
sharpened, and their bows bent. The hoofs of their horses are hard as a
rock. They shall not fail, or need to be shod with iron: the wheels of
their carriages shall move as rapidly as a whirlwind."

Neither shall the girdle - The Eastern people, wearing long and loose
garments, were unfit for action or business of any kind, without girding
their clothes about them. When their business was finished they took off
their girdles. A girdle therefore denotes strength and activity; and to
unloose the girdle is to deprive of strength, to render unfit for
action. God promises to unloose the loins of kings before Cyrus, [Isa
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001.md). The girdle is so essential a
part of a soldier's accoutrements, being the last that he puts on to
make himself ready for action, that to be girded, ζωννυσθαι, with the
Greeks means to be completely armed and ready for battle: -

Ατρειδης δ εβοησεν, ιδε ζωννυσθαι ανωγεν

Αργειους.

Iliad, 11:15.

Το δε ενδυναι τα ὁπλα εκαλουν οἱ παλαιοι ζωννυσθαι.

Pausan. Boeot.

It is used in the same manner by the Hebrews: "Let not him that girdeth
himself boast as he that unlooseth his girdle," [Kg1
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#011.md); that is, triumph not before the
war is finished.

[Isaiah 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">isa 5:28</span></span>

Their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint "The hoofs of their
horses shall be counted as adamant" - The shoeing of horses with iron
plates nailed to the hoof is quite a modern practice, and was unknown to
the ancients, as appears from the silence of the Greek and Roman
writers, especially those that treat of horse medicine, who could not
have passed over a matter so obvious and of such importance that now the
whole science takes its name from it, being called by us farriery. The
horseshoes of leather and iron which are mentioned; the silver and gold
shoes with which Nero and Poppaea shod their mules, used occasionally to
preserve the hoofs of delicate cattle, or for vanity, were of a very
different kind; they enclosed the whole hoof as in a case, or as a shoe
does a man's foot, and were bound or tied on. For this reason the
strength, firmness and solidity of a horse's hoof was of much greater
importance with them than with us, and was esteemed one of the first
praises of a fine horse. Xenophon says that a good horse's hoof is hard,
hollow, and sounds upon the ground like a cymbal. Hence the χαλκοποδες
ἱπποι, of Homer, and Virgil's solido graviter sonat ungula cornu. And
Xenophon gives directions for hardening the horses' hoofs by making the
pavement on which he stands in the stable with roundheaded stones. For
want of this artificial defense to the foot which our horses have, Amos,
[Amo 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#012.md), speaks of it as a thing as
much impracticable to make horses run upon a hard rock as to plough up
the same rock with oxen: -

"Shall horses run upon a rock?

Shall one plough it up with oxen?"

These circumstances must be taken into consideration in order to give us
a full notion of the propriety and force of the image by which the
prophet sets forth the strength and excellence of the Babylonish
cavalry, which made a great part of the strength of the Assyrian army.
Xenop. Cyrop. lib. ii.

Like a whirlwind - כסופה cassuphah, like the stormy blast. Here sense
and sound are well connected.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">isa 5:30</span></span>

If one look unto the land, etc. "And these shall look to the heaven
upward, and down to the earth" - ונבט לארץ venibbat laarets. Και
εμβλεψονται εις την γην. So the Septuagint, according to the Vatican and
Alexandrian copies; but the Complutensian and Aldine editions have it
more fully, thus: - Και εμβλεψονται εις τον ουρανον ανω, και κατω; and
the Arabic from the Septuagint, as if it had stood thus: Και εμβλεψονται
εις ουρανον, και εις την γην κατω, both of which are plainly defective;
the words εις την γην, unto the earth, being wanted in the former, and
the word ανω, above, in the latter. But an ancient Coptic version from
the Septuagint, supposed to be of the second century, some fragments of
which are preserved in the library of St. Germain des Prez at Paris,
completes the sentence; for, according to this version, it stood thus in
the Septuagint. - Και εμβλεψονται εις τον ουρανον ανω, και εις την γην
κατω; "And they shall look unto the heavens above and unto the earth
beneath," and so it stands in the Septuagint MSS., Pachom. and 1. D.
II., according to which they must have read their Hebrew text in this
manner: - ונבט לשמים למעלה ולארץ למטה. This is probably the true
reading, with which I have made the translation agree. Compare [Isa
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#022.md); where the same sense is
expressed in regard to both particulars, which are here equally and
highly proper, the looking upwards, as well as down to the earth: but
the form of expression is varied. I believe the Hebrew text in that
place to be right, though not so full as I suppose it was originally
here; and that of the Septuagint there to be redundant, being as full as
the Coptic version and MSS. Pachom. and 1. D. 2 represent it in this
place, from which I suppose it has been interpolated.

Darkness "The gloomy vapor" - The Syriac and Vulgate seem to have read
בערפלח bearphalach; but Jarchi explains the present reading as
signifying darkness; and possibly the Syriac and Vulgate may have
understood it in the same manner.
