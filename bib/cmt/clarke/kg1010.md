### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg1 10:0</span></span>

The queen of Sheba visits Solomon, and brings rich presents; and tries
him by hard questions, which he readily solves, [Kg1
10:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#001.md). She expresses great surprise
at his wisdom, his buildings, his court, etc.; and praises God for
placing him on the Jewish throne, [Kg1
10:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#004.md). She gives him rich presents,
[Kg1 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#010.md). What the navy of Hiram
brought from Ophir, [Kg1 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#011.md), [Kg1
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#012.md). The queen of Sheba returns,
[Kg1 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#013.md). Solomon's annual revenue,
[Kg1 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#014.md), [Kg1
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#015.md). He makes two hundred targets
and three hundred shields of gold, [Kg1
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#016.md), [Kg1
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#017.md). His magnificent ivory throne,
[Kg1 10:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#018.md). His drinking vessels
all of gold, [Kg1 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#021.md). What the navy
of Tharshish brought every three years to Solomon, [Kg1
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#022.md). His great riches, numerous
chariots, and horsemen, [Kg1 10:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#023.md).
He brings chariots and horses out of Egypt, [Kg1
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#028.md), [Kg1
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#029.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 10:1</span></span>

When the queen of Sheba heard - As our Lord calls her queen of the
south, ([Mat 12:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#042).md), it is likely the
name should be written Saba, Azab, or Azaba, all of which signify the
south. She is called Balkis by the Arabians, but by the Abyssinians
Maqueda. See the account at the end of this chapter, [Kg1
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#029) (note.md).

With hard questions - בחידות bechidoth; Septuagint, εν αινιγμασι,
riddles. With parables and riddles, says the Arabic.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 10:2</span></span>

She came to Jerusalem with - spices, etc. - Those who contend that she
was queen of the Sabaeans, a people of Arabia Felix, towards the
southern extremity of the Red Sea, find several proofs of their opinion:

1\. That the Sabaeans abounded in riches and spices.

India mittit ebur, molles sua thura Sabaei

"India furnishes ivory, and the effeminate Sabaeans their frankincense."

Virg. Geor. i., ver. 57.

And again: -

Divisae arboribus patriae: sola India nigrum

Fert ebenum; solis est thurea virga Sabaeis.

Geor. ii., ver. 116.

All sorts of trees their several countries know:

Black ebon only will in India grow;

And odorous frankincense on the Sabaean bough.

Dryden.

\- Ubi templum illi centumque Sabaeo Thure calent arae.

Where to her fame a hundred altars rise,

And pour Sabaean odours to the skies.

Pliny (Hist. Nat. lib. xii., c. 17) observes,

Non alia ligni genera in usu sunt quam odorata;

cibosque Sabaei coquunt thuris ligno; alii myrrhae.

"The Sabaeans use odorous wood only, and even use the incense tree and
myrrh to cook their victuals."

2\. All ancient authors speak, not only of their odoriferous woods, but
of their rich gold and silver mines, and of their precious stones. See
Pliny, Hist. Nat. lib. xxxvii., c. 6, etc.

3\. It is also well known that the Sabaeans had queens for their
sovereigns, and not kings. So Claudian, in Eutrop. lib. i.

\- Medis levibusque Sabaeis Imperat hic sexus,

reginarumque sub armis Barbariae pars magna jacet.

By this is meant, says Mr. Bruce, the country between the tropic and
mountains of Abyssinia, the country of shepherds, from berber, a
shepherd. And he contends that these Sabaeans were a distinct people
from the Ethiopians and the Arabs, and that Saba was a distinct state.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 10:3</span></span>

Solomon told her all her questions - Riddles, problems, fables,
apologues, etc., formed the principal part of the wisdom of the East;
indeed they use and delight in them to the present day. See the case of
Samson and his friends, [Jdg 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#012.md)
(note), [Jdg 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#014) (note.md), and the
notes there.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 10:4</span></span>

Had seen all Solomon's wisdom - By the answers which he gave to her
subtle questions.

And the house that he had built - Most probably his own house.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 10:5</span></span>

The meat of his table - The immense supply of all kinds of food daily
necessary for the many thousands which were fed at and from his table.
See [Kg1 4:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#022) (note.md).

And the sitting of his servants - The various orders and distinctions of
his officers.

The attendance of his ministers - See the account of these and their
attendance, [Kg1 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#001.md), etc.

And their apparel - The peculiarity of their robes, and their splendor
and costliness.

And his cup-bearers - The original משקיו mashkaiv may as well be applied
to his beverage, or to his drinking utensils, as to his cup-bearers.

And his ascent by which he went up - It seems very strange that the
steps to the temple should be such a separate matter of astonishment.
The original is ועלתו אשר יעלה בית יהוה which all the versions have
translated, And the holocausts which he offered in the house of the
Lord. The Vulgate, Septuagint, Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic, all express
this sense: so does the German translation of Luther, from which, in
this place, we have most pitifully departed: And seine Brandopfer, die
er in dem Hause des Herrn opferte; "And his burnt-offering which he
offered in the house of the Lord."

There was no more spirit in her - She was overpowered with astonishment;
she fainted. I have seen precisely the same effect produced; a lady who
was herself an artist, viewing some exquisitely finished oriental
paintings, was so struck with astonishment that she twice nearly
fainted, and was obliged to leave the room. What happened to the queen
of Sheba is a natural and not an uncommon effect which will be produced
in a delicate sensible mind at the sight of rare and extraordinary
productions of art.

Of the profusion of Solomon's sacrifices we have already had proof, [Kg1
8:63](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#063.md); [Kg1
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#025.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 10:8</span></span>

Happy are thy men - All these are very natural expressions from a person
in her state of mind.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 10:10</span></span>

A hundred and twenty talents of gold - The worth of these one hundred
and twenty talents of gold, according to Mr. Reynolds, is equal to
843,905. 10s. 4 3/4d. of our British sterling. But the spices and
precious stones might have been yet of more value. After this verse the
13th should be read, which is here most evidently misplaced; and then
the account of the queen of Sheba will be concluded, and that of
Solomon's revenue will stand without interruption.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 10:11</span></span>

Great plenty of almug trees - In the parallel place, [Ch2
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#010.md), [Ch2
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#011.md), these are called algum trees,
the ם mem and the ג gimel being transposed; probably the latter is the
more correct orthography. What the algum trees were we do not exactly
know. The Vulgate calls it ligna thyina, the thya or lignum vitae wood;
and Mr. Parkhurst thinks that the original אלגומים algumim, comes from
אל al, not, and גם gem, to fill; because the lignum vitae is of so close
a texture that it can imbibe no water, and cannot be affected by wet
weather. The Septuagint translate it ξυλα πυκινα, pine timber; the
Syriac kaise dakisotho, probably cypress wood, or what the translators
render ligna brasilica; the Arabic translates coloured wood, and
subjoins a paraphrase, for that wood was by nature painted with various
colors. Perhaps the Arabic comes nearest the truth; wood shaded of
different colors, such as the rose wood and such like, which are brought
to us from various parts of the East Indies. The whole passage as it
stands in the Arabic is this: "And the ships of Hiram brought gold from
the land of Hind, (India), and they carried also much coloured wood,
(but this wood is naturally painted of various colors), and very
precious jewels. And Solomon put some of that same painted wood which
was brought to him in the house of the Lord, and in his own house; and
with it he adorned them." And for inlaying and veneering nothing can be
finer than this wood.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 10:13</span></span>

All her desire whatsoever she asked - Some imagine she desired progeny
from the wise king of Israel; and all the traditions concerning her
state that she had a son by Solomon called Menilek, who was brought up
at the Israelitish court, succeeded his mother in the kingdom of Saba,
and introduced among his subjects the Jewish religion. See at the end of
the chapter, [Kg1 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#029) (note.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 10:14</span></span>

The weight of gold - was six hundred threescore and six talents - This
would amount in our money to 4,683, 675 12s. 8 1/2d. sterling.

This seems to be what he got annually of bullion; but independently of
this, he had tribute of all the kings of Arabia, duties from
merchantmen, and the traffic of spice merchants; see [Kg1
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#025.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 10:16</span></span>

Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold - I have already
conjectured that the צנה tsinnah might resemble the Highland targe or
target, with a dagger projecting from the Umbo or center.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 10:17</span></span>

He made three hundred shields - The מגן magen was a large shield by
which the whole body was protected.

Mr. Reynolds computes that the two hundred targets, on each of which
were employed three hundred shekels of gold, were worth 28,131 16s. 9
1/2d.

And the three hundred shields, in forming each of which three pounds of
gold were employed, were worth 210,976 7s. 7d.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 10:19</span></span>

The throne was round behind: and there were stays on either side - This
description seems to indicate that the throne was in the form of one of
our ancient round-topped, two-armed chairs. This throne or chair of
state was raised on a platform, the ascent to which consisted of six
steps. What we call stays is in the Hebrew ידת yadoth, hands, which
serves to confirm the conjecture above.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 10:22</span></span>

A navy of Tharshish - For probable conjectures concerning this place,
and the three years' voyage, see at the end of this, [Kg1
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#029) (note.md) and the preceding
chapter, 1 Kings 9 (note).

Apes - קפים kophim; probably a species of monkey rather than ape.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 10:23</span></span>

Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches - Mr. Reynolds,
stating the yearly tribute of Solomon, 666 talents of gold, at about
four times as much as his father left him, hence reckons that he had
4,909, 371 8s. 8d. each year, 94,410 19s. 9 1/4d. per week, 13,487 5s.
8d. per day, taking each day, week, and year, one with another.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 10:25</span></span>

They brought every man his present - This means tribute; and it shows us
of what sort that tribute was, viz., vessels of gold and silver,
probably ingots; garments of very rich stuffs; armor, for little of this
kind was ever made in Judea; spices, which doubtless sold well in that
country; horses, which were very rare; and mules, the most necessary
animal for all the purposes of life.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg1 10:26</span></span>

He had a thousand and four hundred chariots - See the note on [Kg1
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#026.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 10:27</span></span>

Made silver - as stones - He destroyed its value by making it so
exceedingly plenty.

As the sycamore trees - He planted many cedars, and doubtless had much
cedar wood imported; so that it became as common as the sycamore trees,
which appear to have grown there in great abundance. This is considered
to be a tree that partakes of the nature of the fig tree, and of the
mulberry. Of the former it has the fruit, and of the latter the leaves;
that is, the fruit had a considerable resemblance to the fig, and the
leaf to that of the mulberry tree: hence its name sycamore, from the
Greek συκον, a fig, and μορεα, a mulberry tree.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 10:28</span></span>

Horses brought out of Egypt - It is thought that the first people who
used horses in war were the Egyptians; and it is well known that the
nations who knew the use of this creature in battle had greatly the
advantage of those who did not. God had absolutely prohibited horses to
be imported or used; but in many things Solomon paid little attention to
the Divine command.

And linen yarn - The original word, מקוה mikveh, is hard to be
understood, if it be not indeed a corruption.

The versions are all puzzled with it: the Vulgate and Septuagint make it
a proper name: "And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and from
Coa, or Tekoa." Some think it signifies a tribute, thus Bochart: "They
brought horses to Solomon out of Egypt; and as to the tribute, the
farmers of this prince received it at a price." They farmed the tribute,
gave so much annually for it, taking the different kinds to themselves,
and giving a round sum for the whole.

Some suppose that Mikveh signifies the string or cord by which one
horse's head is tied to the tail of another; and that the meaning is,
Solomon brought droves of horses, thus tied, out of Egypt.

Rabbi Solomon Jarchi, in his comment on the parallel place, [Ch2
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#014.md), says that מקוה mikveh signifies
a collection or drove of horses, or what the Germans call stutte, a
stud. He observes on that place, "That he has heard that there was a
company of merchants in Egypt, who bought horses from the Egyptians at a
certain price, on condition that no person should be permitted to bring
a horse out of Egypt but through them." Houbigant supposes the place to
be corrupt, and that for מקוה mikveh we should read מרכבה mercabah,
chariots: "And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and chariots;
and the king's merchants received the chariots at a price: and a chariot
came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver," etc.
This makes a very good and consistent sense; but none of the versions
acknowledged it, nor is there any various reading here in any of the
MSS. yet collated.

If we understand it of thread, it may refer to the byssus or fine flax
for which Egypt was famous; but I do not see on what authority we
translate it linen thread. Bochart's opinion appears to me the most
probable, as the text now stands; but the charge contended for by
Houbigant makes the text far more simple and intelligible.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg1 10:29</span></span>

A chariot came up - for six hundred shekels - This was the ordinary
price of a chariot, as a hundred and fifty shekels were for a horse.

Kings of the Hittites - These must have been the remains of the original
inhabitants of Canaan, who had gone to some other country, probably
Syria, and formed themselves into a principality there. It seems that
neither horses nor chariots came out of Egypt but by means of Solomon's
servants.
