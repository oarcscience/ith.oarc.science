Introduction to the Book of the Prophet Jeremiah

The Prophet Jeremiah, son of Hilkiah, was of the sacerdotal race, and a
native of Anathoth, a village in the tribe of Benjamin, within a few
miles of Jerusalem, which had been appointed for the use of the priests,
the descendants of Aaron, [Jos 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#018.md).
He was called to the prophetic office when very young; probably when he
was fourteen years of age, and in the thirteenth of the reign of Josiah,
A.M. 3375, b.c. 629. He continued to prophesy till after the destruction
of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans, which took place A.M. 3416; and it is
supposed that about two years after he died in Egypt. Thus it appears
that he discharged the arduous duties of the prophetic office for
upwards of forty years.

Being very young when called to the prophetic office, he endeavored to
excuse himself on account of his youth and incapacity for the work; but,
being overruled by the Divine authority, he undertook the task, and
performed it with matchless zeal and fidelity in the midst of a most
crooked and perverse people, by whom he was continually persecuted, and
whom he boldly reproved, often at the hazard of his life.

His attachment to his country was strong and fervent; he foresaw by the
light of prophecy the ruin that was coming upon it. He might have made
terms with the enemy, and not only saved his life, but have gained ease
and plenty; but he chose rather to continue with his people, and take
his part in all the disasters that befell them.

After the destruction of Jerusalem, Nebuchadnezzar having made Gedaliah
governor of Judea, the fractious Jews rose up against him, and put him
to death; they then escaped to Tahpanhes in Egypt, carrying Jeremiah
with them; who, continuing to testify against their wickedness and
idolatry, at length fell a victim to his faithfulness: they filled up
the measure of their iniquity, as tradition reports, by stoning the
prophet to death. God marked this murderous outrage by his peculiar
displeasure; for in a few years after they were almost all miserably
destroyed by the Chaldean armies which had invaded Egypt; and even this
destruction had been foretold by the prophet himself, chap. 44: "They
were consumed by the sword and by the famine until there was an end of
them, a small remnant only escaping," [Jer
44:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#014.md), [Jer
44:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#027.md), [Jer
44:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#028.md).

The pitch of desperate wickedness to which the Jews had arrived
previously to their captivity was truly astonishing. They had exhausted
all the means that infinite mercy, associated with infinite justice,
could employ for the salvation of sinners; and they became in
consequence desperately wicked; no wonder, therefore, that wrath fell
upon them to the uttermost. It seems that their hardness and darkness
had proceeded to such lengths that they abandoned themselves to all the
abominations of idolatry to avenge themselves on God, because he would
not bear with their continual profligacy. Were ever people more highly
favored, more desperately ungrateful, or more signally punished! What a
lesson is their history to the nations of the earth, and especially to
those who have been favored with the light of revelation!

I should have entered into a particular discussion relative to the
history of those times mentioned by this prophet, had they not passed
already in review in the Books of Kings and Chronicles; in which much of
the historical parts of this prophet has been anticipated; and to which,
in order to avoid repetition, I must refer my readers. What is farther
necessary to be added will be found in the following notes.

As a writer, the character of Jeremiah has been well drawn by Bishop
Lowth. On comparing him with Isaiah, the learned prelate says: "Jeremiah
is by no means wanting either in elegance or sublimity; although,
generally speaking, inferior to Isaiah in both. St. Jerome has objected
to him a certain rusticity in his diction; of which, I must confess, I
do not discover the smallest trace. His thoughts, indeed, are somewhat
less elevated, and he is commonly more large and diffuse in his
sentences; but the reason of this may be, that he is mostly taken up
with the gentler passions of grief and pity, for the expressing of which
he has a peculiar talent. This is most evident in the Lamentations,
where those passions altogether predominate; but it is often visible
also in his Prophecies; in the former part of the book more especially,
which is principally poetical. The middle parts are for the most part
historical; but the last part, consisting of six chapters, is entirely
poetical; and contains several oracles distinctly marked, in which this
prophet falls very little short of the loftiest style of Isaiah." It has
often been remarked, that although several of the prophecies in this
book have their dates distinctly noted, and most of the rest may be
ascertained from collateral evidence; yet there is a strange disorder in
the arrangement. "There is," says Dr. Blayney, "a preposterous jumbling
together of the prophecies of the reigns of Jehoiakim and Zedekiah in
the seventeen chapters which follow the twentieth, according to the
Hebrew copies; so that, without any apparent reason, many of the latter
reigns precede those of the former; and in the same reign, the last
delivered are put first, and the first, last." In order to prevent the
confusion arising from this, Dr. Blayney has transposed the chapters
where he thought it needful, without altering the numerals as they stand
in our common Bibles.

This defect has been noticed, and attempts made to remedy it, by others.
Dr. John George Dahler, Professor of Theology in the Protestant seminary
of Strasburg, has just now published the first volume of a work,
entitled, Jeremie, traduit sur le Texte original, accompagne de Notes
Explicatives, Historiques, et Critiques, 8vo., (antedated) Strasbourg,
1824. After a preface, and very judicious historical introduction,
consisting, the first of twenty-two, the second of thirty-six pages, the
text and notes follow. The poetical parts of the text are translated in
the hemistich manner, as the original appears in the best copies; and
the whole is divided into sections; each of which is introduced with
judicious observations relative to time, place, circumstances, and the
matter contained in that section. The discourses or prophecies delivered
under a particular reign, are all produced under that reign in their
chronological order. A table of this arrangement I shall here introduce,
and refer to the use of it afterwards:

Historical Appendix 52:1-34

The kings under whom Jeremiah prophesied succeeded each other in the
following order:

1\. Josiah;

2\. Jehoahaz;

3\. Jehoiachin, or Jeconiah;

4\. Jehoiakim;

5\. Zedekiah.

To render the transpositions evident which have taken place in these
prophetical discourses, we have only to look at those which bear the
date of their delivery.

Table II [Jer 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md). Delivered the
thirteenth year of Josiah [Jer 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#001.md).
Under Jehoiakim [Jer 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#006.md). Under Josiah
[Jer 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#001.md). Under Jehoiakim [Jer
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001.md). Under Zedekiah [Jer
37:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#001.md). Under Zedekiah during the siege
of Jerusalem [Jer 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001.md). After the
carrying away of Jeconiah, son of Jehoiakim [Jer
37:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#011.md). Under Zedekiah [Jer
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#001.md). The fourth year of Jehoiakim
[Jer 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#001.md). Under Zedekiah [Jer
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#001.md). The beginning of the reign of
Jehoiakim [Jer 39:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#015.md). Under Zedekiah
while Jeremiah was in prison [Jer
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#001.md). The beginning of the reign of
Zedekiah [Jer 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#001.md). The fourth year of
Jehoiakim [Jer 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#001.md). After the
carrying away of Jeconiah [Jer 46:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#002.md).
The fourth year of Jehoiakim [Jer
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#001.md). The tenth year of Zedekiah [Jer
49:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#034.md). In the beginning of the reign
of Zedekiah [Jer 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#001.md). (Under
Zedekiah) during the siege of Jerusalem [Jer
51:59](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#059.md). The fourth year of Zedekiah
[Jer 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#008). (Under Zedekiah.md) when he
had obliged his subjects to give liberty to the Israelites whom they had
reduced to slavery

Taking into consideration the order of the reigns, a child may perceive
that the above prophecies are not in the order of the times of their
delivery; and that the sheets or skins on which the text of that MS. was
written, from which the present copies have derived their origin, have
been pitifully interchanged, huddled and tacked together, without
connection or arrangement.

To remedy this defect, Dr. Blayney has arranged the chapters in the
following order which he terms a new arrangement of the chapters in
Jeremiah, from chap. 20, to chap. 46, inclusive: 20, 22, 23, 25, 26, 35,
36, 45, 24, 29, 30, 31, 27, 28, 21, 34, 37, 32, 33, 38, 39:15-18,
39:1-14, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 46, etc.

The preceding and subsequent chapters Dr. Blayney thought sufficiently
correct for all the general purposes of chronology; and it is according
to this order that he prints the text in his edition and translation of
this prophet.

Dr. Dahler, as we have seen, is more circumstantial. Where he has dates,
as are shown in the preceding table, he produces the text in that order;
where there are not positive dates, he ascertains several by
circumstantial intimations, which bear great evidence of accuracy; but
there is a numerous class of discourses which he is obliged to insert in
this work by critical conjecture. In such a case as this, when the
arrangement of the common text is so evidently defective, and in many
respects absurd, this procedure is quite allowable; for although the
present text as to its arrangement has the sanction of antiquity, yet
when a remedy is found, it would be absurd, if not sinful, to follow an
order which we may rest satisfied never did proceed from the inspired
writer.

I hope none will suppose that these observations detract any thing from
the Divine inspiration of the book. The prophet delivered his discourses
at particular times in select portions, during forty or forty-three
years; these were afterwards gathered together and stitched up without
any attention to chronological arrangement. Though the Spirit of the
Lord directed the prophet, yet it would be absurd to suppose that it
guided the hand of every collector or scribe into whose custody these
several parcels might come. Suppose a man buy a copy of the Bible in
sheets, and not knowing how to collate them, stitches the whole
confusedly together, so that in many places the sense cannot be made out
from a preceding to a following sheet, would it not be singularly
foolish for any person to say, "As God is the Fountain of wisdom and
Author of reason, such incongruities cannot proceed from him, therefore
this book was not given by Divine revelation." A child in a printer's
office might reply, "Cut the stitching asunder, that is man's work;
collate the sheets and put them in their proper order, and you will soon
see that every paragraph is in harmony with the rest, and contains the
words of Divine wisdom." Many an ancient MS., which appeared mutilated
and imperfect, I have restored to order and perfection by cutting the
binding asunder, and restoring the sheets and leaves to those places
from which the ignorance and unskilfulness of the binder had detached
them. May we not be allowed to treat the dislocations in the writings of
a prophet in the same way, when it is evident that in the lapse of time
his work has suffered by the hand of the careless and ignorant.

But it may be asked, "After all the evidence I have, and the concessions
I have made, why I have not transposed those disjointed chapters, and
produced them in the order in which I think they should be read?" I
answer, Were I to give a new translation with notes of this prophet
separately, as Drs. Blayney and Dahler have done, I should feel it my
duty to do what the objection states; but as my province as a general
commentator requires me to take up all the books of the sacred volume in
the order in which I find them in the present authorized version, though
convinced that this arrangement is neither correct nor convenient; so I
take up the parts of each, however transposed, in the same manner,
directing the reader by tables and notes to regulate his use of the work
so as to produce general edification with as little embarrassment as
possible.

For general purposes, Dr. Blayney's chronological arrangement may be
sufficient; but for greater accuracy Table I. may be preferred. These
may at least be considered in the light of helps to a better
understanding of these several prophecies; but no man is bound to follow
either, farther than he is convinced that it follows what is
specifically set down by the prophet himself, or fairly deducible from
strong circumstantial evidence.

In my notes on this prophet I have availed myself, as far as my plan
would permit, of the best helps within my reach. The various readings of
Kennicott and De Rossi I have carefully consulted, and occasionally
strengthened the evidence in behalf of those readings, more particularly
recommended by collations from my own M,SS. I regret that I have not
been able, for the reasons mentioned at the conclusion of the notes on
Isaiah, to produce all the various readings of importance found in these
ancient MSS., and especially in the Book of Lamentations, which is
contained in five of them; but like the woman in the Gospels, I have
done what I could, and must leave the rest to those who, with better
abilities, may possess the greater advantages of youth and strength,
with unimpaired sight.

Reader! God designs thee a blessing by every portion of his word: in thy
reading seek for this; and if these notes be helpful to thee, give Him
the glory.

A.C.

Eastcott, Nov. 1, 1824.
