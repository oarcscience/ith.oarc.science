### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg1 17:0</span></span>

Elijah's message to Ahab concerning the three years' drought, [Kg1
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#001.md). He is commanded to go to the
brook Cherith; where he is fed by ravens, [Kg1
17:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#002.md). He afterwards goes to a
widow's house at Zarephath, and miraculously multiplies her meal and
oil, [Kg1 17:8-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#008.md). Her son dies, and
Elijah restores him to life, [Kg1
17:17-24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#017.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 17:1</span></span>

Elijah the Tishbite - The history of this great man is introduced very
abruptly; his origin is enveloped in perfect obscurity. He is here said
to be a Tishbite. Tishbeh, says Calmet, is a city beyond Jordan, in the
tribe of Gad, and in the land of Gilead. Who was his father, or from
what tribe he sprang, is not intimated; he seems to have been the
prophet of Israel peculiarly, as we never find him prophesying in Judah.
A number of apocryphal writers have trifled at large about his
parentage, miraculous birth, of his continual celibacy, his academy of
the prophets, etc., etc., all equally worthy of credit. One opinion,
which at first view appears strange, bears more resemblance to truth
than any of the above, viz., that he had no earthly parentage known to
any man; that he was an angel of God, united for a time to a human body,
in order to call men back to perfect purity, both in doctrine and
manners, from which they had totally swerved. His Hebrew name, which we
have corrupted into Elijah and Elias, is אליהו Alihu, or, according to
the vowel points, Eliyahu; and signifies he is my God. Does this give
countenance to the supposition that this great personage was a
manifestation in the flesh of the Supreme Being? He could not be the
Messiah; for we find him with Moses on the mount of transfiguration with
Christ. The conjecture that he was an angel seems countenanced by the
manner of his departure from this world; yet, in [Jam
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#017.md), he is said to be a man
ὁμοιοπαθης, of like passions, or rather with real human propensities:
this, however, is irreconcilable with the conjecture.

There shall not be dew nor rain these years - In order to remove the
abruptness of this address, R. S. Jarchi dreams thus: - "Elijah and Ahab
went to comfort Hiel in his grief, concerning his sons. And Ahab said to
Elijah, Is it possible that the curse of Joshua, the son of Nun, who was
only the servant of Moses, should be fulfilled; and the curse of Moses,
our teacher, not be fulfilled; who said, [Deu
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#016.md), [Deu
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#017.md) : If ye turn aside, and serve
other gods, and worship them, then the Lord's wrath shall be kindled
against you; and he will shut up the heaven that there be no rain? Now
all the Israelites serve other gods, and yet the rain is not withheld.
Then Elijah said unto Ahab, As the Lord God of Israel liveth, before
whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according
to my word." This same mode of connecting this and the preceding
chapter, is followed by the Jerusalem and Babylonish Talmuds, Sedar
Olam, Abarbanel, etc.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 17:3</span></span>

Hide thyself by the brook Cherith - This brook, and the valley through
which it ran, are supposed to have been on the western side of Jordan,
and not far from Samaria. Others suppose it to have been on the eastern
side, because the prophet is commanded to go eastward, [Kg1
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#003.md). It was necessary, after such a
declaration to this wicked and idolatrous king, that he should
immediately hide himself; as, on the first drought, Ahab would
undoubtedly seek his life. But what a proof was this of the power of
God, and the vanity of idols! As God's prophet prayed, so there was rain
or drought; and all the gods of Israel could not reverse it! Was not
this sufficient to have converted all Israel?

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 17:4</span></span>

I have commanded the ravens to feed thee - Thou shalt not lack the
necessaries of life; thou shalt be supplied by an especial providence.

See more on this subject at the end of the chapter, [Kg1
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#024) (note.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 17:6</span></span>

And the ravens brought him bread and flesh - The Septuagint, in the
Codex Vaticanus, and some ancient fathers, read the passage thus: - Και
οἱ κορακες εφερον αυτῳ αρτους το πρωΐ, και κρεα το δειλης, And the crows
brought him bread in the morning, and flesh in the evening: but all the
other versions agree with the Hebrew text. This is the first account we
have of flesh-meat breakfasts and flesh-meat suppers; and as this was
the food appointed by the Lord for the sustenance of the prophet, we may
naturally conjecture that it was the food of the people at large.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 17:7</span></span>

The brook dried up - Because there had been no rain in the land for some
time, God having sent this drought as a testimony against the idolatry
of the people: see [Deu 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#016.md), [Deu
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#017.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 17:9</span></span>

Get thee to Zarephath - This was a town between Tyre and Sidon, but
nearer to the latter, and is therefore called in the text Zarephath
which belongeth to Sidon; or, as the Vulgate and other versions express
it, Sarepta of the Sidonians. Sarepta is the name by which it goes in
the New Testament; but its present name is Sarphan. Mr. Maundrell, who
visited it, describes it as consisting of a few houses only on the tops
of the mountains; but supposes that it anciently stood in the plain
below, where there are still ruins of a considerable extent.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg1 17:12</span></span>

A handful of meal in a barrel - The word כד cad is to be understood as
implying an earthen jar; not a wooden vessel, or barrel of any kind. In
the East they preserve their corn and meal in such vessels; without
which precaution the insects would destroy them. Travellers in Asiatic
countries abound with observations of this kind.

The word cruse, צפחת tsappachath, says Jarchi, signifies what in our
tongue is expressed by bouteille, a bottle. Jarchi was a French rabbin.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 17:13</span></span>

But make me thereof a little cake first - This was certainly putting the
widow's faith to an extraordinary trial: to take and give to a stranger,
of whom she knew nothing, the small pittance requisite to keep her child
from perishing, was too much to be expected.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 17:16</span></span>

The barrel of meal wasted not - She continued to take out of her jar and
out of her bottle the quantity of meal and oil requisite for the
consumption of her household; and without carefully estimating what was
left, she went with confidence each time for a supply, and was never
disappointed. This miracle was very like that wrought by Jesus at the
marriage at Cana in Galilee: as the servants drew the water out of the
pots, they found it turned into wine; and thus they continued to draw
wine from the water-pots till the guests had been sufficiently supplied.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 17:17</span></span>

There was no breath left in him - He ceased to breathe and died.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg1 17:18</span></span>

To call my sin to remembrance - She seems to be now conscious of some
secret sin, which she had either forgotten, or too carelessly passed
over; and to punish this she supposes the life of her son was taken
away. It is mostly in times of adversity that we duly consider our moral
state; outward afflictions often bring deep searchings of heart.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 17:21</span></span>

Stretched himself upon the child three times - It is supposed that he
did this in order to communicate some natural warmth to the body of the
child, in order to dispose it to receive the departed spirit. Elisha,
his disciple, did the same in order to restore the dead child of the
Shunammite, [Kg2 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#034.md). And St. Paul
appears to have stretched himself on Eutychus in order to restore him to
life, [Act 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#010.md).

Let this child's soul come into him again - Surely this means no more
than the breath. Though the word נפש nephesh may sometimes signify the
life, yet does not this imply that the spirit must take possession of
the body in order to produce and maintain the flame of animal life? The
expressions here are singular: Let his soul, נפש nephesh, come into him,
על קרבו al kirbo, into the midst of him.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 17:22</span></span>

And the soul - נפש nephesh, of the child came into him again, על קרבו al
kirbo, into the midst of him; and he revived, ויח vaiyechi, and he
became alive. Did he not become alive from the circumstance of the
immaterial principle coming again into him?

Although רוח ruach is sometimes put for the breath, yet נפש generally
means the immortal spirit, and where it seems to refer to animal life
alone, it is only such a life as is the immediate and necessary effect
of the presence of the immortal spirit.

The words and mode of expression here appear to me a strong proof, not
only of the existence of an immortal and immaterial spirit in man, but
also that that spirit can and does exist in a separate state from the
body. It is here represented as being in the midst of the child, like a
spring in the center of a machine, which gives motion to every part, and
without which the whole would stand still.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 17:24</span></span>

The word of the Lord in thy mouth is truth - Three grand effects were
produced by this temporary affliction:

1\. The woman was led to examine her heart, and try her ways;

2\. The power of God became highly manifest in the resurrection of the
child;

3\. She was convinced that the word of the Lord was truth, and that not
one syllable of it could fall to the ground. Through a little suffering
all this good was obtained.

The subject in the fourth verse of this chapter deserves a more
particular consideration.

I have commanded the ravens to feed thee. - It is contended that if we
consider ערבים orebim to signify ravens, we shall find any
interpretation on this ground to be clogged with difficulties. I need
mention but a few. The raven is an unclean bird, And these ye shall have
in abomination among the fowls - every raven after his kind; [Lev
11:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#013.md); that is, every species of
this genus shall be considered by you unclean and abominable. Is it
therefore likely that God would employ this most unclean bird to feed
his prophet? Besides, where could the ravens get any flesh that was not
unclean? Carrion is their food; and would God send any thing of this
kind to his prophet? Again: If the flesh was clean which God sent, where
could ravens get it? Here must be at least three miracles: one to bring
from some table the flesh to the ravens; another, to induce the ravenous
bird to give it up; and the third, to conquer its timidity towards man,
so that it could come to the prophet without fear. Now, although God
might employ a fowl that would naturally strive to prey on the flesh,
and oblige it, contrary to its nature, to give it up; yet it is by no
means likely that he would employ a bird that his own law had pronounced
abominable. Again, he could not have employed this means without working
a variety of miracles at the same time, in order to accomplish one
simple end; and this is never God's method: his plan is ever to
accomplish the greatest purposes by the simplest means.

The original word orebim has been considered by some as meaning
merchants, persons occasionally trading through that country, whom God
directed, by inspiration, to supply the prophet with food. To get a
constant supply from such hands in an extraordinary way was miracle
enough; it showed the superintendence of God, and that the hearts of all
men are in his hands.

But in answer to this it is said, that the "original word never
signifies merchants; and that the learned Bochart has proved this." I
have carefully read over cap. 13, part. ii., lib. 2, of the Hierozoicon
of this author, where he discusses this subject; and think that he has
never succeeded less than in his attempt to prove that ravens are meant
in this passage. He allows that the Tyrian merchants are described by
this periphrasis, ערבי מערבך, the occupiers of thy merchandise, [Eze
27:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#027.md); and asserts that ערבים orebim,
per se, mercatores nusquam significat, "by itself, never signifies
merchants." Now, with perfect deference to so great an authority, I
assert that ערבי oreby, the contracted form of ערבים orebim, does
signify merchants, both in [Eze 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#009.md)
and [Eze 27:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#027.md), and that מערב maarab
signifies a place for merchandise, the market-place or bazaar, in [Eze
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#009.md), [Eze
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#013.md), [Eze
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#017.md), [Eze
27:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#019.md); as also the goods sold in such
places, [Eze 27:33](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#033.md); and therefore that
ערבים for aught proved to the contrary, signify merchants in the text.

As to Bochart's objection, that, the prophet being ordered to go to the
brook Cherith, that he might lie hid, and the place of his retreat not
be known, if any traders or merchants supplied his wants, they would
most likely discover where he was, etc., I think there is no weight in
it; for the men might be as well bound by the secret inspiration of God
not to discover the place of his retreat, as they were to supply his
wants; besides, they might have been of the number of those seven
thousand men who had not bowed their knees to the image of Baal, and
consequently would not inform Ahab and Jezebel of their prophet's hiding
place.

Some have supposed that the original means Arabians; but Bochart
contends that there were no Arabians in that district: this is certainly
more than he or any other man can prove. Colonies of Arabs, and hordes
and families of the same people, have been widely scattered over
different places for the purpose of temporal sojournment and trade; for
they were a wandering people, and often to be found in different
districts remote enough from the place of their birth. But, letting this
pass merely for what it is worth, and feeling as I do the weight of the
objections that may be brought against the supposition of ravens being
the agents employed to feed the prophet, I would observe that there was
a town or city of the name of Orbo, that was not far from the place
where Elijah was commanded to hide himself. In Bereshith Rabba, a
rabbinical comment on Genesis, we have these words עיר היא בתחום ביתשאן
ושמה ערבו ir hi bithchom Beithshean, veshemo Orbo; "There is a town in
the vicinity of Beth-shan, (Scythopolis), and its name is Orbo." We may
add to this from St. Jerome, Orbim, accolae villae in finibus Arabum,
Eliae dederunt alimenta; "The Orbim, inhabitants of a town in the
confines of the Arabs, gave nourishment to Elijah." Now, I consider
Jerome's testimony to be of great worth, because he spent several years
in the holy land, that he might acquire the most correct notion possible
of the language and geography of the country, as well as of the customs
and habits of the people, in order to his translating the sacred
writings, and explaining them. Had there not been such a place in his
time, he could not have written as above: and although in this place the
common printed editions of the Vulgate have corvi, "crows or ravens;"
yet in [Ch2 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#016.md), St. Jerome
translates the same word ערבים, "the Arabians;" and the same in [Neh
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#007.md); it is therefore most likely that
the inhabitants of Oreb or Orbo, as mentioned above, furnished the
aliment by which the prophet was sustained; and that they did this being
specially moved thereto by the Spirit of the Lord. Add to all these
testimonies that of the Arabic version, which considers the words as
meaning a people, Orabim, and not ravens or fowls of any kind. In such a
case this version is high authority.

It is contended that those who think the miracle is lost if the ravens
be not admitted, are bound to show,

1\. With what propriety the raven, an unclean animal, could be employed?

2\. Why the dove, or some such clean creature, was not preferred?

3\. How the ravens could get properly dressed flesh to bring to the
prophet?

4\. From whose table it was taken; and by what means?

5\. Whether it be consistent with the wisdom of God, and his general
conduct, to work a tissue of miracles where one was sufficient?

6\. And whether it be not best, in all cases of this kind, to adopt that
mode of interpretation which is most simple; the wisdom, goodness, and
providence of God being as equally apparent as in those cases where a
multitude of miracles are resorted to in order to solve difficulties?
