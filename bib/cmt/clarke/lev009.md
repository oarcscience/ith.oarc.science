### [Leviticus Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lev 9:0</span></span>

Aaron is commanded to offer, on the eighth day, a sin-offering and a
burnt-offering, [Lev 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#001.md), [Lev
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#002.md). The people are commanded also to
offer a sin-offering, a burnt-offering, peace-offerings, and a
meat-offering, [Lev 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#003.md), [Lev
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#004.md). They do as they were commanded;
and Moses promises that God shall appear among them, [Lev
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#005.md), [Lev
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#006.md). Aaron is commanded to make an
atonement for the people, [Lev 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#007.md). He
and his sons prepare and offer the different sacrifices, [Lev
9:8-21](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#008.md). Aaron and Moses bless the
congregation, [Lev 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#022.md), [Lev
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#023.md). And the fire of the Lord
consumes the sacrifice, [Lev 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#024.md).

[Leviticus 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 9:1</span></span>

On the eighth day - This was the first day after their consecration,
before which they were deemed unfit to minister in holy things, being
considered as in a state of imperfection. "All creatures," says
Ainsworth, "for the most part were in their uncleanness and imperfection
seven days, and perfected on the eighth; as children by circumcision,
[Lev 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#002.md), [Lev
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#003.md); young beasts for sacrifice, [Lev
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#027.md); persons that were unclean by
leprosies, issues, and the like, [Lev
14:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#008.md); [Lev
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#013.md), [Lev
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#014.md); [Num
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#009.md), [Num
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#010.md). So here, the priests, until the
eighth day, were not admitted to minister in their office."

[Leviticus 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 9:2</span></span>

Take thee a young calf, etc. - As these sacrifices were for Aaron
himself, they are furnished by himself and not by the people, for they
were designed to make atonement for his own sin. See [Lev
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#003.md). And this is supposed by the Jews
to have been intended to make an atonement for his sin in the matter of
the golden calf. This is very probable, as no formal atonement for that
transgression had yet been made.

[Leviticus 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 9:3</span></span>

Take ye a kid - In [Lev 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#014.md) a young
bullock is commanded to be offered for the sin of the people; but here
the offering is a kid, which was the sacrifice appointed for the sin of
the ruler, [Lev 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#022.md), [Lev
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#023.md), and hence some think that the
reading of the Samaritan and the Septuagint is to be preferred. Speak
unto the Elders of Israel, these being the only princes or rulers of
Israel at that time; and for them it is possible this sacrifice was
designed. It is however supposed that the sacrifice appointed [Lev
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#014.md) was for a particular sin, but
this for sin in general; and that it is on this account that the
sacrifices differ.

[Leviticus 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 9:6</span></span>

And the glory of the Lord shall appear - God shall give the most
sensible signs of his presence among you; this he did in general by the
cloud on the tabernacle, but in this case the particular proof was the
fire that came out from before the Lord, and consumed the
burnt-offering; see [Lev 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#023.md), [Lev
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#024.md).

[Leviticus 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lev 9:7</span></span>

Make an atonement for thyself - This showed the imperfection of the
Levitical law; the high priest was obliged to make an expiation for his
own sins before he could make one for the sins of the people. See the
use made of this by the apostle, [Heb
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#003.md); [Heb
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#027.md); [Heb
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#007.md).

[Leviticus 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lev 9:22</span></span>

And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them - On
lifting up the hands in prayer, see [Exo
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#029.md). The form of the blessing we have
in [Num 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#023.md), etc.: "The Lord bless
thee and keep thee! The Lord make his face shine upon thee, and be
gracious unto thee! The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give
thee peace!" See the notes on these passages [Exo
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#029) (note.md), and [Num
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#023) (note.md).

And came down from offering of the sin-offering, etc. - A sin-offering,
a burnt-offering, a meat-offering, and peace-offerings, were made to God
that his glory might appear to the whole congregation. This was the end
of all sacrifice and religious service; not to confer any obligation on
God, but to make an atonement for sin, and to engage him to dwell among
and influence his worshippers.

[Leviticus 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">lev 9:23</span></span>

Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle - It is supposed that Moses
accompanied Aaron into the tabernacle to show him how to offer the
incense, prepare the lamps and the perfume, adjust the shew-bread, etc.,
etc.

And the glory of the Lord appeared - To show that every thing was done
according to the Divine mind,

1\. The glory of Jehovah appears unto all the people;

2\. A fire came out from before the Lord, and consumed the
burnt-offering. This was the proof which God gave upon extraordinary
occasions of his acceptance of the sacrifice. This was done probably,

1\. In the case of Abel, [Gen 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#004.md).

2\. In the case of Aaron; see above, [Lev
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#024.md).

3\. In the case of Gideon, [Jdg 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#021.md).

4\. In the case of Manoah and his wife. Compare [Jdg
13:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#019.md).

5\. In the case of David dedicating the threshing-floor of Ornan, [Ch1
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#028.md).

6\. In the case of Solomon dedicating the temple, [Ch2
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#001.md).

7\. In the case of Elijah, [Kg1 18:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#038.md).

Hence to express the accepting of an offering, sacrifice, etc., the verb
דשן dishshen is used, which signifies to reduce to ashes, i. e., by fire
from heaven. See [Psa 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#003.md). In such a
case as this, it was necessary that the fire should appear to be
divinely sent, and should come in such a way as to preclude the
supposition that any art or deceit had been practiced on the occasion.
Hence it is not intimated that Moses and Aaron brought it out of the
tabernacle, professing that God had kindled it there for them, but the
fire Came Out from Before the Lord, and All the People Saw it. The
victims were consumed by a fire evidently of no human kindling. Josephus
says that "a fire proceeded from the victims themselves of its own
accord, which had the appearance of a flash of lightning;" εξ αυτων πυρ
ανηφθη αυτοματον, και ὁμοιον αστραπης λαμπηδονι ὁρωμενον τῃ φλογι· "and
consumed, all that was upon the altar." - Antiq., lib. iii., c. 8, s. 6,
edit. Haverc. And it is very likely that by the agency of the ethereal
or electric spark, sent immediately from the Divine presence, the
victims were consumed. The heathens, in order to give credit to their
worship, imitated this miracle, and pretended that Jupiter testified his
approbation of the sacrifices offered to him by thunder and lightning:
to this Virgil seems to allude, though the words have been understood
differently.

Audiat haec genitor, qui foedera fulmine sancit.

Aen. xii., ver. 200.

"Let Jupiter hear, who sanctions covenants by his thunder."

On which words Servius makes this remarkable comment: Quia cum fiunt
foedera, si coruscatio fuerit, confirmantur. Vel certe quia apud majores
arae non incendebantur, sed ignem divinum precibus eliciebant qui
incendebant altaria. "To sanction the covenant signifies to confirm it;
for when a covenant was made, if there were a flash of lightning, it was
considered to be thereby confirmed: or rather because our Ancestors
lighted no fire upon the altars, but obtained by their supplications
divine fire," etc. The expression apud majores, "among our ancestors,"
shows that they could boast of no such divine fire then; nor could they
ever before, as the whole account was borrowed from the Jews. Solinus
Polyhistor gives us an account to the same effect; for, speaking of the
hill of Vulcan in Sicily, he says: In quo, qui divinte rei operantur,
ligna vitea super aras struunt, nec ignis apponitur in hanc congerlem:
cum prosicias intulerunt, si adest deus, si sacrum probatur, sarmenta
licet viridia sponte concipiunt, et nullo inflagrante halitu, ab ipso
numine fit accendium, cap. v. in fine. "They who perform sacred rites in
this place, put a bundle of vine-tree wood upon the altar, but put no
fire to it; for when they lay the pieces of the victim upon it, if the
deity be present, and he approve the sacrifice, the bundle, although of
green wood, takes fire of itself, and without any other means the deity
himself kindles the flame." These are remarkable instances, and show how
exactly the heathen writers have borrowed from the sacred records. And
in farther imitation of this miracle, they had their perpetual fire in
the temple of Vesta, which they feigned to have descended at first from
heaven, and which they kept with the most religious veneration.

[Leviticus 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">lev 9:24</span></span>

When all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces -

1\. The miracle was done in such a way as gave the fullest conviction to
the people of its reality.

2\. They exulted in the thought that the God of almighty power and
energy had taken up his abode among them.

3\. They prostrated themselves in his presence, thereby intimating the
deep sense they had of His goodness, of their unworthiness, and of the
obligation they were under to live in subjection to his authority, and
obedience to his will -

This celestial fire was carefully preserved among the Israelites till
the time of Solomon, when it was renewed, and continued among them till
the Babylonish captivity. This Divine fire was the emblem of the Holy
Spirit. And as no sacrifice could be acceptable to God which was not
salted, i. e., seasoned and rendered pleasing, by this fire, as our Lord
says, [Mar 9:49](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#049.md), so no soul can offer
acceptable sacrifices to God, but through the influences of the Divine
Spirit. Hence the promise of the Spirit under the emblem of fire, [Mat
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011.md), and its actual descent in this
similitude on the day of pentecost, [Act
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#003.md), [Act
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#004.md).

The most remarkable circumstance in this chapter is the manifestation of
the presence of God, and the consuming of the victims by the miraculous
fire. We have already seen that the chief design of these sacrificial
rites was to obtain reconciliation to God, that the Divine Presence
might dwell and be manifested among them. To encourage the people to
make the necessary preparations, to offer the sacrifices in a proper
spirit, and to expect especial mercies from the hand of God, Moses
promises, [Lev 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#004.md), that the Lord
would appear unto them on the morrow, and that his glory should appear,
[Lev 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#006.md). In hope or expectation of
this, the priest, the elders, and the people purified themselves by
offering the different sacrifices which God had appointed; and when this
was done God did appear, and gave the fullest proofs of his approbation,
by miraculously consuming the sacrifices which were prepared on the
occasion. Does not St. John evidently refer to these circumstances, [Jo1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002.md), [Jo1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#003.md) : "Beloved, now are we the sons of
God; and it doth not yet appear what we shall be; but we know that when
he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is;
and every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth himself, even as he
is pure." This manifestation of God in the tabernacle was a type of his
presence, first, in the Church militant on earth; and secondly, in the
Church triumphant in heaven. They who expect to have the presence of God
here, must propitiate his throne of justice by the only available
sacrifice; they who wish to enjoy everlasting felicity, must be purified
from all unrighteousness, for without holiness none can see the Lord. If
we hope to see him as he is, we must resemble him. How vain is the
expectation of glory, where there is no meetness for the place! And how
can we enter into the holiest but by the blood of Jesus? [Heb
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019.md). And of what use can this
sacrifice be to those who do not properly believe in it? And can any
faith, even in that sacrifice, be effectual to salvation, that does not
purify the heart? Reader! earnestly pray to God that thou hold not the
truth in unrighteousness.
