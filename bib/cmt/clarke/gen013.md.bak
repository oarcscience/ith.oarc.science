### [Genesis Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 13:0</span></span>

Abram and his family return out of Egypt to Canaan, [Gen
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#001.md), [Gen
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#002.md). He revisits Beth-el, and there
invokes the Lord, [Gen 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#003.md), [Gen
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#004.md). In consequence of the great
increase in the flocks of Abram and Lot, their herdsmen disagree; which
obliges the patriarch and his nephew to separate, [Gen
13:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#005.md). Lot being permitted to make
his choice of the land, chooses the plains of Jordan, [Gen
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#010.md), [Gen
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#011.md), and pitches his tent near to
Sodom, while Abram abides in Canaan, [Gen
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#012.md). Bad character of the people of
Sodom, [Gen 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#013.md). The Lord renews his
promise to Abram, [Gen 13:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#014.md). Abram
removes to the plains of Mamre, near Hebron, and builds an altar to the
Lord, [Gen 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#018.md).

[Genesis 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 13:1</span></span>

Abram went up out of Egypt - into the south - Probably the south of
Canaan, as In leaving Egypt he is said to come from the south, [Gen
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#003.md), for the southern part of the
promised land lay north-east of Egypt.

[Genesis 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 13:2</span></span>

Abram was very rich - The property of these patriarchal times did not
consist in flocks only, but also in silver and gold; and in all these
respects Abram was דבד מאד cabed meod, exceeding rich. Josephus says
that a part of this property was acquired by teaching the Egyptians arts
and sciences. Thus did God fulfill his promises to him, by protecting
and giving him a great profusion of temporal blessings, which were to
him signs and pledges of spiritual things.

[Genesis 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 13:3</span></span>

Beth-el - See Genesis 8.

[Genesis 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 13:6</span></span>

Their substance was great - As their families increased, it was
necessary their flocks should increase also, as from those flocks they
derived their clothing, food, and drink. Many also were offered in
sacrifice to God.

They could not dwell together - 1. Because their flocks were great. 2.
Because the Canaanites and the Perizzites had already occupied a
considerable part of the land. 3. Because there appears to have been
envy between the herdsmen of Abram and Lot. To prevent disputes among
them, that might have ultimately disturbed the peace of the two
families, it was necessary that a separation should take place.

[Genesis 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 13:7</span></span>

The Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land - That is, they
were there at the time Abram and Lot came to fix their tents in the
land. See the note on [Gen 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#006.md).

[Genesis 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 13:8</span></span>

For we be brethren - We are of the same family, worship the same God in
the same way, have the same promises, and look for the same end. Why
then should there be strife? If it appear to be unavoidable from our
present situation, let that situation be instantly changed, for no
secular advantages can counterbalance the loss of peace.

[Genesis 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 13:9</span></span>

Is not the whole land before thee - As the patriarch or head of the
family, Abram, by prescriptive right, might have chosen his own portion
first, and appointed Lot his; but intent upon peace, and feeling pure
and parental affection for his nephew, he permitted him to make his
choice first.

[Genesis 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 13:10</span></span>

Like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar - There is an obscurity
in this verse which Houbigant has removed by the following translation:
Ea autem, priusquam Sodomam Gornorrhamque Do minus delerit, erat, qua
itur Segor, tota irrigua, quasi hortus Domini, et quasi terra Aegypti.
"But before the Lord had destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, it was, as thou
goest to Zoar, well watered, like the garden of the Lord, and like the
land of Egypt." As paradise was watered by the four neighboring streams,
and as Egypt was watered by the annual overflowing of the Nile; so were
the plains of the Jordan, and all the land on the way to Zoar, well
watered and fertilized by the overflowing of the Jordan.

[Genesis 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 13:11</span></span>

Then Lot chose him all the plain - A little civility or good breeding is
of great importance in the concerns of life. Lot either had none, or did
not profit by it. He certainly should have left the choice to the
patriarch, and should have been guided by his counsel; but he took his
own way, trusting to his own judgment, and guided only by the sight of
his eyes: he beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered,
etc.; so he chose the land, without considering the character of the
inhabitants, or what advantages or disadvantages it might afford him in
spiritual things. This choice, as we shall see in the sequel, had nearly
proved the ruin of his body, soul, and family.

[Genesis 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 13:13</span></span>

The men of Sodom were wicked - רעים raim, from רע, ra, to break in
pieces, destroy, and afflict; meaning persons who broke the established
order of things, destroyed and confounded the distinctions between right
and wrong, and who afflicted and tormented both themselves and others.
And sinners, חטאים chattaim, from חטא chata, to miss the mark, to step
wrong, to miscarry; the same as ἁμαρτανω in Greek, from a, negative, and
μαρπτω to hit a mark; so a sinner is one who is ever aiming at happiness
and constantly missing his mark; because, being wicked - radically evil
within, every affection and passion depraved and out of order, he seeks
for happiness where it never can be found, in worldly honors and
possessions, and in sensual gratifications, the end of which is
disappointment, affliction, vexation, and ruin. Such were the companions
Lot must have in the fruitful land he had chosen. This, however, amounts
to no more than the common character of sinful man; but the people of
Sodom were exceedingly sinful and wicked before, or against, the Lord -
they were sinners of no common character; they excelled in
unrighteousness, and soon filled up the measure of their iniquities. See
Genesis 19.

[Genesis 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 13:14</span></span>

The Lord said unto Abram - It is very likely that the angel of the
covenant appeared to Abram in open day, when he could take a distinct
view of the length and the breadth of this good land. The revelation
made [Gen 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#005.md), was evidently made in
the night; for then he was called to number the stars, which could not
be seen but in the night season: here he is called on to number the dust
of the earth, [Gen 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#016.md), which could
not be seen but in the day-light.

[Genesis 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 13:15</span></span>

To thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever - This land was given
to Abram, that it might lineally and legally descend to his posterity;
and though Abram himself cannot be said to have possessed it, [Act
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#005.md), yet it was the gift of God to him
in behalf of his seed; and this was always the design of God, not that
Abram himself should possess it, but that his posterity should, till the
manifestation of Christ in the flesh. And this is chiefly what is to be
understood by the words for ever, אד עולם ad olam, to the end of the
present dispensation, and the commencement of the new. עולם olam means
either Eternity, which implies the termination of all time or duration,
such as is measured by the celestial luminaries: or a hidden, unknown
period, such as includes a completion or final termination of a
particular era, dispensation, etc.; therefore the first is its proper
meaning, the latter its accommodated meaning. See the note on [Gen
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#007.md). See the note on [Gen
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#033.md).

[Genesis 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 13:18</span></span>

Abram removed his tent - Continued to travel and pitch in different
places, till at last he fixed his tent in the plain, or by the oak, of
Mamre, see [Gen 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#006.md), which is in
Hebron; i.e., the district in which Mamre was situated was called
Hebron. Mamre was an Amorite then living, with whom Abram made a league,
[Gen 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#013.md); and the oak probably went
by his name, because he was the possessor of the ground. Hebron is
called Kirjath-arba, [Gen 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#002.md); but it
is very likely that Hebron was its primitive name, and that it had the
above appellation from being the residence of four gigantic or powerful
Anakim, for Kirjath-arba literally signifies the city of the four; See
note on [Gen 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#002.md).

Built there an altar unto the Lord - On which he offered sacrifice, as
the word מזבח mizbach, from זבח zabach, to slay, imports.

The increase of riches in the family of Abram must, in the opinion of
many, be a source of felicity to them. If earthly possessions could
produce happiness, it must be granted that they had now a considerable
share of it in their power. But happiness must have its seat in the
mind, and, like that, be of a spiritual nature; consequently earthly
goods cannot give it; so far are they from either producing or procuring
it, that they always engender care and anxiety, and often strifes and
contentions. The peace of this amiable family had nearly been destroyed
by the largeness of their possessions. To prevent the most serious
misunderstandings, Abram and his nephew were obliged to separate. He who
has much in general wishes to have more, for the eye is not satisfied
with seeing. Lot, for the better accommodation of his flocks and family,
chooses the most fertile district in that country, and even sacrifices
reverence and filial affection at the shrine of worldly advantage; but
the issue proved that a pleasant worldly prospect may not be the most
advantageous, even to our secular affairs. Abram prospered greatly in
the comparatively barren part of the land, while Lot lost all his
possessions, and nearly the lives of himself and family, in that land
which appeared to him like the garden of the Lord, like a second
paradise. Rich and fertile countries have generally luxurious,
effeminate, and profligate inhabitants; so it was in this case. The
inhabitants of Sodom were sinners, and exceedingly wicked, and their
profligacy was of that kind which luxury produces; they fed themselves
without fear, and they acted without shame. Lot however was, through the
mercy of God, preserved from this contagion: he retained his religion;
and this supported his soul and saved his life, when his goods and his
wife perished. Let us learn from this to be jealous over our own wills
and wishes; to distrust flattering prospects, and seek and secure a
heavenly inheritance. "Man wants but little; nor that little long." A
man's life - the comfort and happiness of it - does not consist in the
multitude of the things he possesses. "One house, one day's food, and
one suit of raiment," says the Arabic proverb, "are sufficient for thee;
and if thou die before noon, thou hast one half too much." The example
of Abram, in constantly erecting an altar wherever he settled, is worthy
of serious regard; he knew the path of duty was the way of safety, and
that, if he acknowledged God in all his ways, he might expect him to
direct all his steps: he felt his dependence on God, he invoked him
through a Mediator, and offered sacrifices in faith of the coming
Savior; he found blessedness in this work - it was not an empty service;
he rejoiced to see the day of Christ - he saw it and was glad. See note
on [Gen 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#008.md). Reader, has God an altar
in thy house? Dost thou sacrifice to him? Dost thou offer up daily by
faith, in behalf of thy soul and the souls of thy family, the Lamb of
God who taketh away the sin of the world? No man cometh unto the Father
but by me, said Christ: this was true, not only from the incarnation,
but from the foundation of the world. And to this another truth, not
less comfortable, may be added: Whosoever cometh unto me I will in
no-wise cast out.
