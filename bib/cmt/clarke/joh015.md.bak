### [John Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001.md)

[John](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">joh 15:0</span></span>

The union of Jesus Christ with his followers, represented by the parable
of a vine and its branches, [Joh
15:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001.md). He exhorts them to mutual
love, [Joh 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#012.md). Calls them his
friends, and promises to lay down his life for them, [Joh
15:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#013.md). Appoints them their work,
and promises them success in it, [Joh
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#016.md). Renews the exhortation to
mutual love, [Joh 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#017.md), and foretells
the opposition they would meet with from the world, [Joh
15:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#018.md). The sin of the Jews in
rejecting Christ, [Joh 15:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#022.md). The
Holy Spirit is promised as a witness for Christ, and the Comforter of
the disciples, [Joh 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#026.md), [Joh
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#027.md).

[John 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 15:1</span></span>

I am the true vine - Perhaps the vines which they met with, on their
road from Bethany to Gethsemane, might have given rise to this
discourse. Some of the disciples were probably making remarks on the
different kinds of them, and our Lord took the opportunity of improving
the conversation, according to his usual manner, to the instruction of
their souls. He might here term himself the true vine, or vine of the
right sort, in opposition to the wild and barren vine. Some MSS. and
several of the fathers read the verse thus: I am the true vine, ye are
the branches, and my Father is the husbandman. Some think that, as this
discourse followed the celebration of the Eucharist, our Lord took
occasion from the fruit of the vine, used in that ordinance, to
introduce this similitude.

[John 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 15:2</span></span>

Every branch in me - I stand in the same relation to my followers, and
they to me, as the vine to the branches, and the branches to the vine.

He taketh away - As the vine-dresser will remove every unfruitful branch
from the vine, so will my Father remove every unfruitful member from my
mystical body - such as Judas, the unbelieving Jews, the apostatizing
disciples, and all false and merely nominal Christians, who are attached
to the vine by faith in the word and Divine mission of Christ, while
they live not in his life and Spirit, and bring forth no fruit to the
glory of God; and also every branch which has been in him by true faith
- such as have given way to iniquity, and made shipwreck of their faith
and of their good conscience: all these he taketh away.

He purgeth it - He pruneth. The branch which bears not fruit, the
husbandman αερει αυτο, taketh It away; but the branch that beareth
fruit, καθαιρει αυτο, he taketh away From it, i.e. he prunes away
excrescences, and removes every thing that might hinder its increasing
fruitfulness. The verb καθαιρω; from κατα, intens. and αιρω, I take
away, signifies ordinarily to cleanse, purge, purify, but is certainly
to be taken in the sense of pruning, or cutting off, in this text, as
the verb purgare is used by Horace, Epist. lib. i. ep. vii. v. 51.

Cultello proprios purgantem leniter ungues.

"Composedly Paring his own nails with a penknife."

He who brings forth fruit to God's glory, according to his light and
power, will have the hinderances taken away from his heart; for his very
thoughts shall be cleansed by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost.

[John 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 15:3</span></span>

Now ye are clean - Καθαροι εστε, Ye are pruned. As our Lord has not
changed the metaphor, it would be wrong to change the expression.

Through the word - Δια τον λογον, Through that word - that doctrine of
holiness which I have incessantly preached unto you, and which ye have
received. Perhaps our Lord more immediately refers here to the words
which he had spoken concerning Judas, [Joh
13:21-30](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#021.md), in consequence of which
Judas went out and finished his bargain with the chief priests; he being
gone off, the body of the apostles was purified; and thus he might say,
Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.

[John 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 15:4</span></span>

Abide in me - Hold fast faith and a good conscience; and let no trials
turn you aside from the truth. And I will abide in you - ye shall
receive every help and influence from me that your souls can require, in
order to preserve and save them to eternal life.

These two things are absolutely necessary to our salvation:

1\. That we continue closely united to Christ by faith and love, and
live in and to him.

2\. That we continually receive from him the power to do good; for as
the branch, however good in itself, cannot bear fruit from itself,
through its own juice, which it has already derived from the tree, and
can be no longer supported than it continues in union with the parent
stock, neither can ye, unless ye abide in me. As the branch partakes of
the nature of the tree, is nourished by its juice, and lives by its
life, so ye must be made partakers of my Divine nature, be wise in my
wisdom, powerful in my might, and pure through my holiness.

[John 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 15:5</span></span>

Without me ye can do nothing - Χωρις εμου ου δυνασθε ποιειν ουδεν -
Separated from me, ye can do nothing at all. God can do without man, but
man cannot do without God. Following the metaphor of our Lord, it would
be just as possible to do any good without him, as for a branch to live,
thrive, and bring forth fruit, while cut off from that tree from which
it not only derives its juices, but its very existence also.

Nearly similar to this saying of our Lord, is that of Creeshna (the
incarnate God of the Hindoos) to his disciple Arjoon: "God is the gift
of charity; God is the offering: God is the fire of the altar; by God
the sacrifice is performed; and God is to be obtained by him who maketh
God alone the object of his works." And again: "I am the sacrifice; I am
the worship; I am the spices; I am the invocation; I am the fire; and I
am the victim. I am the Father and Mother of this world, and the
Preserver. I am the Holy One, worthy to be known; the mystic figure Om;
(see on [Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014) (note).md) I am the
journey of the good; the Comforter; the Creator; the Witness; the
resting-place; the asylum, and the Friend. I am the place of all things;
and the inexhaustible seed of nature; I am sunshine, and I am rain; I
now draw in, and now let forth." See Bhagvat Geeta, pp. 54 and 80. Could
such sentiments as these ever come from any other source than Divine
revelation? There is a saying in Theophilus very similar to one of those
above: Θεος ου χωρειται, αλλα αυτος εστι τοπος των ὁλων. - God is not
comprehended, but he is the place of all things.

[John 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 15:6</span></span>

If a man abide not in me - Our Lord in the plainest manner intimates
that a person may as truly be united to him as the branch is to the tree
that produces it, and yet be afterwards cut off and cast into the fire;
because he has not brought forth fruit to the glory of his God. No man
can cut off a branch from a tree to which that branch was never united:
it is absurd, and contrary to the letter and spirit of the metaphor, to
talk of being seemingly in Christ - because this means nothing. If there
was only a seeming union, there could be only a seeming excision: so the
matter is just where it began; nothing is done on either side, and
nothing said to any purpose.

He is cast forth - Observe, that person who abides not in Christ, in a
believing loving, obedient spirit, is -

1\. Cut off from Jesus, having no longer any right or title to him or to
his salvation.

2\. He is withered - deprived of all the influences of God's grace and
Spirit; loses all his heavenly unction; becomes indifferent, cold, and
dead to every holy and spiritual word and work.

3\. He is gathered - becomes (through the judgment of God) again united
with backsliders like himself and other workers of iniquity; and, being
abandoned to his own heart and Satan, he is,

4\. Cast into the fire - separated from God's people, from God himself,
and from the glory of his power. And,

5\. He is burned - is eternally tormented with the devil and his angels,
and with all those who have lived and died in their iniquity. Reader!
pray God that this may never be thy portion.

[John 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 15:7</span></span>

If ye abide in me, etc. - "Those," says Creeshna, "whose understandings
are in him, (God), whose souls are in him, whose confidence is in him,
whose asylum is in him, are by the inspired wisdom purified from all
their offenses, and go from whence they shall never return." Geeta, p.
59.

Observe, in order to have influence with God, we must -

1\. Be united to Christ - if ye abide in me.

2\. That in order to be preserved in this union, we must have our lives
regulated by the doctrine of Christ - and my words abide in you.

3\. That to profit by this union and doctrine, we must pray - ye shall
ask.

4\. That every heavenly blessing shall be given to those who continue in
this union, with a loving, obedient, praying spirit: - ye shall ask what
ye will, etc.

[John 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 15:8</span></span>

Herein is my Father glorified - Or, honored. It is the honor of the
husbandman to have good, strong, vigorous vines, plentifully laden with
fruit: so it is the honor of God to have strong, vigorous, holy
children, entirely freed from sin, and perfectly filled with his love.

[John 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 15:10</span></span>

If ye keep my commandments, etc. - Hence we learn that it is impossible
to retain a sense of God's pardoning love, without continuing in the
obedience of faith.

[John 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 15:11</span></span>

That my joy may remain in you - That the joy which I now feel, on
account of your steady, affectionate attachment to me, may be lasting, I
give you both warnings and directions, that ye may abide in the faith.

That your joy might be full - Or, complete - πληρωθη, filled up: a
metaphor taken from a vessel, into which water or any other thing is
poured, till it is full to the brim. The religion of Christ expels all
misery from the hearts of those who receive it in its fullness. It was
to drive wretchedness out of the world that Jesus came into it.

Bishop Pearce, by joining εν εμοι to χαρα, and not to μεινῃ, translates
the verse thus: These things have I spoken, that my joy in you may
remain - which is according to the meaning given to the first clause.

[John 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 15:12</span></span>

That ye love one another - See on [Joh
13:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#034) (note.md). So deeply was thus
commandment engraved on the heart of this evangelist that St. Jerome
says, lib. iii. c. 6, Com. ad Galat., that in his extreme old age, when
he used to be carried to the public assemblies of the believers, his
constant saying was, Little children, love one another. His disciples,
wearied at last with the constant repetition of the same words, asked
him, Why he constantly said the same thing? "Because (said he) it is the
commandment of the Lord, and the observation of it alone is sufficient."
Quia praeceptum Domini est, et, si solum fiat, sufficit.

[John 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 15:13</span></span>

That a man lay down his life for his friends - No man can carry his love
for his friend farther than this: for, when he gives up his life, he
gives up all that he has. This proof of my love for you I shall give in
a few hours; and the doctrine which I recommend to you I am just going
to exemplify myself. There are several remarkable cases, in heathen
antiquity, where one friend offered his life for another. The two
following will not stand dishonorably even in the book of God; became
every thing loving and pure, in heathen, Jew, or Christian, must come
from the God of love and purity.

When Cyrus had made war on the king of Armenia, and had taken him, his
wife, and children, with Tigranes his son, and his wife, prisoners;
treating with the old king concerning his ransom, he said, How much
money wilt thou give me to have thy wife again? All that I have, replied
the king. And how much wilt thou advance to enjoy thy children again?
All that I can produce, answered the king. By reckoning thus, said
Cyrus, you prize these at twice as much as you possess. Then, turning to
Tigranes, he said, How much wilt thou give as a ransom, that thou mayest
have thy wife? (Now Tigranes had been but lately married, και ὑπερφιλων
την γυναικα, and loved his wife exceedingly.) He answered, I will
indeed, O Cyrus, και της ψυχης πριαιμην, ransom her even with My Life,
that she may be no longer in thraldom. See Xenoph. Cyrop. lib. iii. c.

The second example, which is too long to be inserted, is that affecting
account of the friendship of Nisus and Euryalus, given by Virgil, in the
ninth book of the Aeneis. These two friends, leagued together, had slain
many of the Rutulians in a night attack: at last Euryalus was taken
prisoner. Nisus, concealed in a thicket, slew several of the enemy's
chiefs with his javelins: Volscens, their general, not seeing the hand
by which his officers were slain, determines to wreak his vengeance upon
his prisoner. Nisus, seeing his friend about to be transfixed with the
sword, rushing out of the wood where he lay hidden, suddenly cries: -

Me! Me! adsum qui Feci! in Me convertite ferrum,

O Rutuli! MeA fraus omnis: - nihil Iste - nec ausus,

Nec potuit - Caelum hoc, et conscia sidera testor!

Tantum infelicem Nimium Dilexit Amicum.

Aen. lib. ix. l. 427, etc.

"Me! Me! he cried, turn all your swords alone

On Me! - the fact confess'd, the fault my own.

He neither could, nor durst, the guiltless youth;

Ye moon and stars, bear witness to the truth!

His only crime (if friendship can offend)

Is too much love to his unhappy friend."

Dryden.

Those who understand the beautiful original will at once perceive that
the earnestness, confusion, disorder, impatience, and burning love of
the Friend, are poorly imitated in the above tame translation.

The friendship of David and Jonathan is well known: the latter
cheerfully gave up his crown to his friend, though himself was every way
worthy to wear it. But when all these instances of rare friendship and
affection are seen, read, and admired, let the affected reader turn his
astonished eyes to Jesus, pouring out his blood, not for his friends,
but for his Enemies; and, in the agonies of death, making supplication
for his murderers, with, Father, forgive them, for they know not what
they do! - and then let him help exclaiming, if he can,

"O Lamb of God, was ever pain,

Was ever Love like Thine!"

[John 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 15:15</span></span>

Henceforth I call you not servants - Which he at least indirectly had
done, [Joh 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#016.md); [Mat
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#024.md), [Mat
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#025.md); [Luk
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#010.md).

I have called you friends - I have admitted you into a state of the most
intimate fellowship with myself; and have made known unto you whatsoever
I have heard from the Father, which, in your present circumstances, it
was necessary for you to be instructed in.

[John 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 15:16</span></span>

Ye have not chosen me - Ye have not elected me as your Teacher: I have
called you to be my disciples; witnesses and depositories of the truth.
It was customary among the Jews for every person to choose his own
teacher.

And ordained you - Rather, I have appointed you: the word is εθηκα, I
have Put or placed you, i.e. in the vine.

Theodorus Mopsuensis, as quoted by Wetstein, observes that εθηκα is here
used for εφυτευσα; (I have planted); "and, in saying this, our Lord
still makes use of the metaphor of the vine; as if he had said: I have
not only planted you, but I have given you the greatest benefits,
causing your branches to extend every where through the habitable
world."

The first ministers of the Gospel were the choice of Jesus Christ; no
wonder, then, that they were so successful. Those whom men have since
sent, without the appointment of God, have done no good. The choice
should still continue with God, who, knowing the heart, knows best who
is most proper for the Gospel ministry.

To be a genuine preacher of the Gospel, a man must -

1\. Be chosen of God to the work.

2\. He must be placed in the true vine - united to Christ by faith.

3\. He must not think to lead an idle life, but labor.

4\. He must not wait till work be brought to him, but he must go and
seek it.

5\. He must labor so as to bring forth fruit, i.e. to get souls
converted to the Lord.

6\. He must refer all his fruit to God, who gave him the power to labor,
and blessed him in his work.

7\. He must take care to water what he has planted, that his fruit may
remain - that the souls whom he has gathered in be not scattered from
the flock.

8\. He must continue instant in prayer, that his labors may be
accompanied with the presence and blessing of God - Whatsoever ye shall
Ask.

9\. He must consider Jesus Christ as the great Mediator between God and
man, proclaim his salvation, and pray in his name. - Whatsoever ye shall
ask of the Father in my name, etc. See Quesnel.

[John 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 15:18</span></span>

If the world hate you - As the followers of Christ were to be exposed to
the hatred of the world, it was no small consolation to them to know
that that hatred would be only in proportion to their faith and
holiness; and that, consequently, instead of being troubled at the
prospect of persecution, they should rejoice, because that should always
be a proof to them that they were in the very path in which Jesus
himself had trod. Dr. Lardner thinks that πρωτον is a substantive, or at
least an adjective used substantively, and this clause of the text
should be translated thus: If the world hate you, know that it hated me,
your Chief. It is no wonder that the world should hate you, when it
hated me, your Lord and Master, whose lips were without guile, and whose
conduct was irreproachable. See the doctor's vindication of this
translation, Works, vol. i. p. 306.

[John 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 15:19</span></span>

Ye are not of the world - therefore, etc. - On this very account,
because ye do not join in fellowship with those who know not God,
therefore they hate you. How true is that saying: -

"The laws of Christ condemn a vicious world,

And goad it to revenge!"

Gambold.

[John 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 15:20</span></span>

If they have kept my saying - Or, doctrine. Whosoever acknowledges me
for the Christ will acknowledge you for my ministers.

Some translate the passage thus: If they have Watched my sayings, i.e.
with an intent to accuse me for something which I have said, they will
Watch yours also: therefore be on your guard. Παρατηρειν has this sense,
as we have had occasion to observe before; and perhaps τηρειν has the
same sense here, as it is much more agreeable to the context.

[John 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 15:21</span></span>

Because they know not him that sent me - This is the foundation of all
religious persecution: those who are guilty of it, whether in Church or
state, know nothing about God. If God tolerates a worship which
professes to have him for its object, and which does not disturb the
quiet or peace of society, no man has the smallest right to meddle with
it; and he that does fights against God. His letting it pass is at least
a tacit command that all should treat it as he has done.

[John 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 15:22</span></span>

But now they have no cloke for their sin - (margin: Or, excuse) They are
without excuse. See the note on [Joh
9:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#041.md). Christ had done such works as
demonstrated him to be the Messiah - yet they rejected him: here lay
their sin; and this sin, and the punishment to which it exposed them,
still remain; for they still continue to reject the Lord that bought
them.

[John 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 15:25</span></span>

Written in their law - See on [Joh
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#034) (note.md). These words are taken
from [Psa 69:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#004.md). This psalm is applied
to Christ, [Joh 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#017.md); [Joh
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#028.md); to the vengeance of God against
Judea, [Act 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#020.md). The psalm seems
entirely prophetic of Christ. His deep abasement is referred to, [Psa
69:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#002.md); his prayer for his disciples
and followers, [Psa 69:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#006.md); that for
himself, in the garden of Gethsemane, [Psa
69:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#015.md); his crucifixion, [Psa
69:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#020.md); the vengeance of God against
the Jews, from [Psa 69:23-29](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#023.md); the
glorious manner in which he gets out of all his sufferings, [Psa
69:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#030.md); the abolition of the Mosaic
rites and ceremonies, [Psa 69:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#031.md),
compared with [Isa 66:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#003.md); and, finally,
the establishment of the Gospel through the whole world, in [Psa
69:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#033.md) and following verses. The reader
will do well to consult the psalm before he proceeds.

[John 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 15:26</span></span>

But when the Comforter is come - See on [Joh
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#016) (note.md).

He shall testify and ye also shall bear witness - He shall bear his
testimony in your souls, and ye shall bear this testimony to the world.
And so they did, by their miracles, their preaching, their writings,
their lives, and by their deaths. Our Lord appears to reason thus: In
every respect the unbelief of the Jews is inexcusable. They believe not
my doctrine, notwithstanding its purity and holiness. They believe not
in the Father who sent me, notwithstanding I have confirmed my mission
by the most astonishing miracles. One thing only remains now to be done,
i.e. to send them the Holy Spirit, to convince them of sin,
righteousness, and judgment; and this he shall do, not only by his
influence upon their hearts, but also by your words: and when they shall
have resisted this Spirit, then the cup of their iniquity shall be
filled up, and wrath shall come upon them to the uttermost.

But in what sense can it be said that Christ wrought more miracles than
any other had done, [Joh 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#024.md)? - for
Elijah and Elisha raised the dead; cured diseases; and made fire to come
down from heaven. Did Christ do greater miracles than Moses did in Egypt
- at the Red Sea - at the rock of Horeb, and at the rock of Kadesh? Did
Christ do greater miracles than Joshua did, in the destruction of
Jericho - in the passage of Jordan - in causing the sun and moon to
stand still? To all this it may be answered, Christ's miracles were
greater:

1\. As to their number.

2\. As to their utility - they were wrought to comfort the distressed,
and to save the lost.

3\. Christ wrought all his miracles by his own power alone; and they
wrought theirs through his power only.

4\. Christ wrought his numerous miracles in the space of three or four
years, and in the presence of the same people; and the others mere
wrought from time to time in different centuries.

Some critics have confined the whole of this chapter to the apostles of
our Lord, and the work of propagating Christianity to which they had
been called. The whole comment of Rosenmuller on this chapter proceeds
on this plan; and at once shows how nugatory it is. What learned labor
has there been in the world, to banish the spirit of Christianity from
the earth, while the letter was professed to be scrupulously regarded!

1\. The spiritual union spoken of by Christ is not merely necessary for
his primitive disciples, but also for all who would be Christians on
earth, and beatified spirits in heaven.

2\. The brotherly love here inculcated is the duty and interest of every
Christian soul on the face of the earth.

3\. The necessity of adorning the Christian profession, by bringing
forth corresponding fruits, is the duty of all who name the name of the
Lord Jesus.

4\. The appointment to, and preparation for, the work of the sacred
ministry, must ever be primarily with Christ: for those who have no
higher authority than that which they derive from man are never likely
to be useful in Christianizing the world.

5\. The persecution to which the apostles were exposed has been the
common lot of Christians from the foundation of Christianity.

6\. The consolations and influences of Christ's Spirit have not been the
exclusive privileges of the apostles; they are the birthright of all the
sons and daughters of God.
