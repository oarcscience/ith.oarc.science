### [Mark Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#001.md)

[Mark](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mar 8:0</span></span>

Four thousand persons fed with seven loaves and a few small fishes, [Mar
8:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#001.md). Christ refuses to give any
farther sign to the impertinent Pharisees, [Mar
8:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#010.md). Warns his disciples against
the corrupt doctrine of the Pharisees and of Herod, [Mar
8:13-21](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#013.md). He restores sight to a blind
man, [Mar 8:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#022.md). Asks his disciples
what the public thought of him, [Mar
8:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#027.md). Acknowledges himself to be
the Christ, and that he must suffer, [Mar
8:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#031.md). And shows that all his
genuine disciples must take up their cross, suffer in his cause, and
confess him before men, [Mar 8:34-38](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#034.md).

[Mark 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 8:1</span></span>

The multitude being very great - Or rather, There was again a great
multitude. Instead of παμπολλου, very great, I read παλιν πολλου, again
a great, which is the reading of BDGLM, fourteen others, all the Arabic,
Coptic, Ethiopic, Armenian, Gothic, Vulgate, and Itala, and of many
Evangelistaria. Griesbach approves of this reading. There had been such
a multitude gathered together once before, who were fed in the same way.
See [Mar 6:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#034.md), etc.

[Mark 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 8:2</span></span>

Having nothing to eat - If they had brought any provisions with them,
they were now entirely expended; and they stood in immediate need of a
supply.

[Mark 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 8:3</span></span>

For divers of them came from far - And they could not possibly reach
their respective homes without perishing, unless they got food.

[Mark 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mar 8:4</span></span>

etc. - See on [Mat 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#014) (note.md); [Mat
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#035.md).

[Mark 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 8:7</span></span>

And they had a few small fishes - This is not noticed in the parallel
place, [Mat 15:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#036.md).

[Mark 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 8:10</span></span>

Dalmanutha - See the note on [Mat
15:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#039.md).

[Mark 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 8:12</span></span>

And he sighed deeply in his spirit - Or having deeply groaned - so the
word αναστεναξας properly means. He was exceedingly affected at their
obstinacy and hardness of heart. See [Mat
16:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#001.md).

[Mark 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 8:14</span></span>

Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread - See all this, to [Mar
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#021.md), explained at large on [Mat
16:4-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#004) (note.md). In the above chapter,
an account is given of the Pharisees, Sadducees, and Herodians.

[Mark 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mar 8:22</span></span>

They bring a blind man unto him - Christ went about to do good, and
wherever he came he found some good to be done; and so should we, if we
had a proper measure of the same zeal and love for the welfare of the
bodies and souls of men.

[Mark 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mar 8:23</span></span>

And he took the blind man by the hand - Giving him a proof of his
readiness to help him, and thus preparing him for the cure which he was
about to work.

Led him out of the town - Thus showing the inhabitants that he
considered them unworthy of having another miracle wrought among them.
He had already deeply deplored their ingratitude and obstinacy: see on
[Mat 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#021) (note.md). When a people do
not make a proper improvement of the light and grace which they receive
from God, their candlestick is removed - even the visible Church becomes
there extinct; and the candle is put out - no more means of spiritual
illumination are afforded to the unfaithful inhabitants: [Rev
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#005.md).

When he had spit on his eyes - There is a similar transaction to this
mentioned by John, [Joh 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#006.md). It is
likely this was done merely to separate the eyelids; as, in certain
cases of blindness, they are found always gummed together. It required a
miracle to restore the sight, and this was done in consequence of Christ
having laid his hands upon the blind man: it required no miracle to
separate the eyelids, and, therefore, natural means only were employed -
this was done by rubbing them with spittle; but whether by Christ, or by
the blind man, is not absolutely certain. See on [Mar
7:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#033) (note.md). It has always been
evident that false miracles have been wrought without reason or
necessity, and without any obvious advantage; and they have thereby been
detected: on the contrary, true miracles have always vindicated
themselves by their obvious utility and importance; nothing ever being
effected by them that could be performed by natural means.

If he saw aught - Ει, if, is wanting in the Syriac, all the Persic and
Arabic, and in the Ethiopic; and τι βλεπεις, Dost thou see any thing? is
the reading of CD, Coptic, Ethiopic, all the Arabic and Persic.

[Mark 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 8:24</span></span>

I see men as trees, walking - His sight was so imperfect that he could
not distinguish between men and trees, only by the motion of the former.

[Mark 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mar 8:25</span></span>

And saw every man clearly - But instead of ἁπαντας, all men, several
excellent MSS., and the principal versions, have ἁπαντα, all things,
every object; for the view he had of them before was indistinct and
confused. Our Lord could have restored this man to sight in a moment;
but he chose to do it in the way mentioned in the text, to show that he
is sovereign of his own graces; and to point out that, however
insignificant means may appear in themselves, they are divinely
efficacious when he chooses to work by them; and that, however small the
first manifestations of mercy may be, they are nevertheless the
beginnings of the fullness of the blessings of the Gospel of peace.
Reader, art thou in this man's state? Art thou blind? Then come to Jesus
that he may restore thee. Hast thou a measure of light? Then pray that
he may lay his hands again on thee, that thou mayest be enabled to read
thy title clear to the heavenly inheritance.

[Mark 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 8:26</span></span>

He sent him away to his house - So it appears that this person did not
belong to Bethsaida, for, in going to his house, he was not to enter
into the village.

This miracle is not mentioned by any other of the evangelists. It
affords another proof that Mark did not abridge Matthew's Gospel.

[Mark 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 8:27</span></span>

And Jesus went out, etc. - See on [Mat
16:13-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#013) (note.md).

[Mark 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mar 8:29</span></span>

Thou art the Christ - Three MSS. and some versions add, the Son of the
living God.

[Mark 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mar 8:32</span></span>

And he spake that saying - Concerning the certainty and necessity of his
sufferings - openly: with great plainness, παρῥησια, confidence, or
emphasis, so that the disciples now began fully to understand him. This
is an additional observation of St. Mark. For Peter's reproof, see on
[Mat 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#022) (note.md), etc.

[Mark 8:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mar 8:34</span></span>

Whosoever will come after me - It seems that Christ formed, on the
proselytism of the Jews, the principal qualities which he required in
the proselytes of his covenant.

The first condition of proselytism among the Jews was, that he that came
to embrace their religion should come voluntarily, and that neither
force nor influence should be employed in this business. This is also
the first condition required by Jesus Christ, and which he considers as
the foundation of all the rest: - If a man be willing to come after me.

The second condition required in the Jewish proselyte was, that he
should perfectly renounce all his prejudices, his errors, his idolatry,
and every thing that concerned his false religion; and that he should
entirely separate himself from his most intimate friends and
acquaintances. It was on this ground that the Jews called proselytism a
new birth, and proselytes new-born, and new men; and our Lord requires
men to be born again, not only of water, but by the Holy Ghost. See [Joh
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#005.md). All this our Lord includes in
this word, Let him renounce himself. To this the following scriptures
refer: [Mat 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#033.md); [Joh
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#003.md), [Joh
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#005.md), [Co2
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017.md).

The third condition on which a person was admitted into the Jewish
Church as a proselyte was, that he should submit to the yoke of the
Jewish law, and bear patiently the inconveniences and sufferings with
which a profession of the Mosaic religion might be accompanied. Christ
requires the same condition; but, instead of the yoke of the law, he
brings in his own doctrine, which he calls his yoke, [Mat
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029.md) : and his cross, the taking up
of which not only implies a bold profession of Christ crucified, but
also a cheerful submitting to all the sufferings and persecutions to
which he might be exposed, and even to death itself.

The fourth condition was, that they should solemnly engage to continue
in the Jewish religion, faithful even unto death. This condition Christ
also requires; and it is comprised in this word, Let him Follow me. See
the following verses; and see, on the subject of proselytism, [Rut
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#016.md), [Rut
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#017) (note.md).

[Mark 8:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mar 8:35</span></span>

For whosoever will save his life - On this and the following verses, see
[Mat 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#024.md), etc.

[Mark 8:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mar 8:38</span></span>

Whosoever - shall be ashamed of me - Our Lord hints here at one of the
principal reasons of the incredulity of the Jews, - they saw nothing in
the person of Jesus Christ which corresponded to the pompous notions
which they had formed of the Messiah.

If Jesus Christ had come into the world as a mighty and opulent man,
clothed with earthly glories and honors, he would have had a multitude
of partisans, and most of them hypocrites.

And of my words - This was another subject of offense to the Jews: the
doctrine of the cross must be believed; a suffering Messiah must be
acknowledged; and poverty and affliction must be borne; and death,
perhaps, suffered in consequence of becoming his disciples.

Of him, and of his words, in this sense, the world is, to this day,
ashamed.

Of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed - As he refused to
acknowledge me before men, so will I refuse to acknowledge him before
God and his angels. Terrible consequence of the rejection of Christ! And
who can help him whom the only Savior eternally disowns. Reader! Lay
this subject seriously to heart; and see the notes on [Mat
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#024.md), etc., and at the end of that
chapter.

All the subjects contained in this chapter are very interesting; but
particularly:

1\. The miraculous feeding of the multitudes, which is a full,
unequivocal proof of the supreme Divinity of Jesus Christ: in this
miracle he truly appears in his creative energy, with which he has
associated the tenderest benevolence and humanity. The subject of such a
prince must ever be safe; the servant of such a master must ever have
kind usage; the follower of such a teacher can never want nor go astray.

2\. The necessity of keeping the doctrine of the Gospel uncorrupt, is
strongly inculcated in the caution to avoid the leaven of the Pharisees
and of Herod: the doctrine of the cross must not only be observed and
held inviolate, but that doctrine must never be mixed with worldly
politics.

Time-serving is abominable in the sight of God: it shows that the person
has either no fixed principle of religion, or that he is not under the
influence of any.
