### [Revelation Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#001)

[Revelation](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">rev 11:0</span></span>

The command to measure the temple, [Rev
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#001), [Rev
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#002). The two witnesses which should
prophesy twelve hundred and sixty days, [Rev
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#003). The description, power, and
influence of these witnesses, [Rev
11:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#004). They shall be slain by the
beast which shall arise out of the bottomless pit, and shall arise again
after three days and a half, and ascend to heaven, [Rev
11:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#007). After which shall be a great
earthquake, [Rev 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#013). The
introduction to the third wo, [Rev
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#014). The sounding of the seventh
angel, and the four and twenty elders give glory to God, [Rev
11:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015).

[Revelation 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 11:1</span></span>

And there was given me a reed - See [Eze
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#003), etc.

Measure the temple of God - This must refer to the temple of Jerusalem;
and this is another presumptive evidence that it was yet standing.

[Revelation 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 11:2</span></span>

But the court - is given unto the Gentiles - The measuring of the temple
probably refers to its approaching destruction, and the termination of
the whole Levitical service; and this we find was to be done by the
Gentiles, (Romans), who were to tread it down forty-two months; i.e.,
just three years and a half, or twelve hundred and sixty days. This must
be a symbolical period.

[Revelation 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 11:3</span></span>

My two witnesses - This is extremely obscure; the conjectures of
interpreters are as unsatisfactory as they are endless on this point.
Conjecturas conjecturis superstruunt, parum verosimiles, says
Rosenmuller: quorum sententias enarrare, meum non est. I say the same.
Those who wish to be amused or bewildered, may have recourse both to
ancients and moderns on this subject.

[Revelation 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 11:4</span></span>

These are the two olive trees - Mentioned [Zac
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#014), which there represent Zerubbabel
and Joshua the high priest. The whole account seems taken from [Zac
4:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#001). Whether the prophet and the
apostle mean the same things by these emblems, we know not.

[Revelation 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 11:5</span></span>

Fire proceedeth out of their mouth - That is, they are commissioned to
denounce the judgments of God against all who would attempt to prevent
them from proceeding in their ministry.

[Revelation 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 11:6</span></span>

These have power to shut heaven - As Elijah did, 1 Kings 17:1-18:46.

To turn them to blood - As Moses did, [Exo
7:19-25](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#019). They shall have power to
afflict the land with plagues, similar to those which were inflicted on
the Egyptians.

[Revelation 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 11:7</span></span>

The beast that ascended out of the bottomless pit - This may be what is
called antichrist; some power that is opposed to genuine Christianity.
But what or whence, except from the bottomless pit, i.e., under the
influence and appointment of the devil, we cannot tell; nor do we know
by what name this power or being should be called. The conjectures
concerning the two witnesses and the beast have been sufficiently
multiplied. If the whole passage, as some think, refer to the
persecution raised by the Jews against the Christians, then some Jewish
power or person is the beast from the bottomless pit. If it refer to the
early ages of Christianity, then the beast may be one of the persecuting
heathen emperors. If it refer to a later age of Christianity, then the
beast may be the papal power, and the Albigenses and Waldenses the two
witnesses, which were nearly extinguished by the horrible persecutions
raised up against them by the Church of Rome. Whatever may be here
intended, the earth has not yet covered their blood.

[Revelation 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 11:8</span></span>

The great city - Some say Rome, which may be spiritually called Sodom
for its abominations, Egypt for its tyrannous cruelty, and the place
where our Lord was crucified, because of its persecution of the members
of Christ; but Jerusalem itself may be intended. All these things I must
leave to others.

[Revelation 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 11:9</span></span>

Shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves - They shall be
treated with the greatest barbarity. Refusal of burial to the dead was
allowed to be the sum of brutality and cruelty. In popish lands they
will not suffer a Protestant to have Christian burial, or to have a
grave in a churchyard! Contemptible wretches!

[Revelation 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 11:10</span></span>

Shall send gifts - This was a custom in days of public rejoicing. They
sent gifts to each other, and gave portions to the poor. See [Est
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#019), [Est
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#022).

[Revelation 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 11:11</span></span>

They stood upon their feet - Were restored to their primitive state.

[Revelation 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 11:12</span></span>

They ascended up to heaven - Enjoyed a state of great peace and
happiness.

[Revelation 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 11:13</span></span>

A great earthquake - Violent commotions among the persecutors, and
revolutions of states.

Slain of men seven thousand - Many perished in these popular commotions.

The remnant were affrighted - Seeing the hand of God's judgments so
remarkably stretched out.

Gave glory - Received the pure doctrines of the Gospel, and glorified
God for his judgments and their conversion.

[Revelation 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 11:14</span></span>

The seconds wo is past - That which took place under the sixth trumpet,
and has been already described.

The third wo cometh - Is about to be described under the seventh
trumpet, which the angel is now prepared to sound.

Of the three woes which were denounced, [Rev
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#013), the first is described, [Rev
9:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#001); the second, [Rev
9:13-21](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#013). These woes are supposed by
many learned men to refer to the destruction of Jerusalem. The first wo
- the seditions among the Jews themselves. The second wo - the besieging
of the city by the Romans. The third wo - the taking and sacking of the
city, and burning the temple. This was the greatest of all the woes, as
in it the city and temple were destroyed, and nearly a million of men
lost their lives.

[Revelation 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rev 11:15</span></span>

There were great voices in heaven - All the heavenly host - angels and
redeemed human spirits, joined together to magnify God; that he had
utterly discomfited his enemies and rendered his friends glorious. This
will be truly the case when the kingdoms of this world become the
kingdoms of God and of his Christ, But when shall this be? Some say,
that is meant by these words has already taken place in the destruction
of the Jewish state, and sending the Gospel throughout the Gentile
world. Others say that it refers to the millennium, and to the
consummation of all things.

[Revelation 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rev 11:16</span></span>

The four and twenty elders - The representatives of the universal Church
of Christ. See on [Rev 5:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#008) (note).

[Revelation 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rev 11:17</span></span>

O Lord God Almighty, which art - This gives a proper view of God in his
eternity; all times are here comprehended, the present, the past, and
the future. This is the infinitude of God.

Hast taken to thee - Thou hast exercised that power which thou ever
hast; and thou hast broken the power of thy enemies, and exalted thy
Church.

[Revelation 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rev 11:18</span></span>

The nations were angry - Were enraged against thy Gospel, and determined
to destroy it.

Thy wrath is come - The time to avenge thy servants and to destroy all
thy enemies.

The time of the dead, that they should be judged - The word κρινειν, to
judge, is often used in the sense of to avenge. The dead, here, may mean
those who were slain for the testimony of Jesus, and the judging is the
avenging of their blood.

Give reward unto thy servants - Who have been faithful unto death.

The prophets - The faithful teachers in the Church, the saints - the
Christians.

And them that fear thy name - All thy sincere followers.

Destroy them which destroy the earth - All the authors, fomenters, and
encouragers of bloody wars.

[Revelation 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rev 11:19</span></span>

The temple of God was opened in heaven - The true worship of God was
established and performed in the Christian Church; this is the true
temple, that at Jerusalem being destroyed.

And there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an
earthquake, and great hail - These great commotions were intended to
introduce the following vision; for the 12th chapter is properly a
continuation of the 11th, and should be read in strict connection with
it.

I Now come to a part of this book that is deemed of the greatest
importance by the Protestant Church, but is peculiarly difficult and
obscure. I have often acknowledged my own incapacity to illustrate these
prophecies. I might have availed myself of the labors of others, but I
know not who is right; or whether any of the writers on this book have
hit the sense is more than I can assert, and more than I think. The
illustration of the 12th, 13th, and 17th chapters, which I have referred
to in the preface, drawn up and displayed with great industry and
learning, I shall insert in its place, as by far the most probable I
have yet seen; but I leave the learned author responsible for his own
particular views of the subject.
