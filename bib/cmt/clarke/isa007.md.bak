### [Isaiah Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 7:0</span></span>

The king of Judah and the royal family being in the utmost consternation
on receiving accounts of the invasion of the kings of Syria and Israel,
the prophet is sent to assure them that God would make good his promises
to David and his house; so that, although they might be corrected, they
could not be destroyed, while these prophecies remained to be
accomplished, [Isa 7:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#001.md). The Lord
gives Ahaz a sign that the confederacy against Judah shall be broken,
which sign strikingly points out the miraculous conception of the
Messiah, who was to spring from the tribe of Judah, [Isa
7:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#010.md). Prediction of very heavy
calamities which the Assyrians would inflict upon the land of Judea,
[Isa 7:17-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#017.md).

The confederacy of Rezin, king of Syria, and Pekah, king of Israel,
against the kingdom of Judah, was formed in the time of Jotham; and
perhaps the effects of it were felt in the latter part of his reign; see
[Kg2 15:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#037.md), and note on [Isa
1:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#007) (note.md). However, in the very
beginning of the reign of Ahaz, they jointly invaded Judah with a
powerful army, and threatened to destroy or to dethrone the house of
David. The king and royal family being in the utmost consternation on
receiving advises of their designs, Isaiah is sent to them to support
and comfort them in their present distress, by assuring them that God
would make good his promises to David and his house. This makes the
subject of this, and the following, and the beginning of the ninth
chapters, in which there are many and great difficulties.

Chap. 7 begins with an historical account of the occasion of this
prophecy; and then follows, [Isa
7:4-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#004.md), a prediction of the ill
success of the designs of the Israelites and Syrians against Judah; and
from thence to the end of the chapter, a denunciation of the calamities
to be brought upon the king and people of Judah by the Assyrians, whom
they had now hired to assist them. Chap. 8 has a pretty close connection
with the foregoing; it contains a confirmation of the prophecy before
given of the approaching destruction of the kingdoms of Israel and Syria
by the Assyrians, of the denunciation of the invasion of Judah by the
same Assyrians. [Isa 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#009.md), [Isa
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#010.md), give a repeated general
assurance, that all the designs of the enemies of God's people shall be
in the end disappointed and brought to naught; [Isa
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#011.md), etc., admonitions and
threatenings, (I do not attempt a more particular explanation of this
very difficult part), concluding with an illustrious prophecy [Isa
9:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001.md), of the manifestation of
Messiah, the transcendent dignity of his character, and the universality
and eternal duration of his kingdom.

[Isaiah 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 7:3</span></span>

Now - נא na, is omitted by two MSS., the Septuagint, Syriac, Arabic, and
Vulgate.

[Isaiah 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 7:4</span></span>

The Syriac omits וארם vearam, "and Syria;" the Vulgate reads מלך ארם
melech aram, "king of Syria:" one or the other seems to be the true
reading. I prefer the former: or, instead of וארם ובן vearam uben, read
ופקח בן vepekach ben, and pekah son, MS.

[Isaiah 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 7:5</span></span>

Because - Remaliah - All these words are omitted by one MS. and the
Syriac; a part of them also by the Septuagint.

[Isaiah 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 7:8</span></span>

For the head of Syria, etc. - "Though the head of Syria be Damascus, And
the head of Damascus Retsin; Yet within threescore and five years
Ephraim shall be broken, that he be no more a people: And the head of
Ephraim be Samaria; And the head of Samaria Remaliah's son.

"Here are six lines, or three distichs, the order of which seems to have
been disturbed by a transposition, occasioned by three of the lines
beginning with the same word וראש verosh, "and the head," which three
lines ought not to have been separated by any other line intervening;
but a copyist, having written the first of them, and casting his eye on
the third, might easily proceed to write after the first line beginning
with וראש verosh, that which ought to have followed the third line
beginning with וראש verosh. Then finding his mistake, to preserve the
beauty of his copy, added at the end the distich which should have been
in the middle; making that the second distich, which ought to have been
the third. For the order as it now stands is preposterous: the
destruction of Ephraim is denounced, and then their grandeur is set
forth; whereas naturally the representation of the grandeur of Ephraim
should precede that of their destruction. And the destruction of Ephraim
has no coherence with the grandeur of Syria, simply as such, which it
now follows: but it naturally and properly follows the grandeur of
Ephraim, joined to that of Syria their ally.

"The arrangement then of the whole sentence seems originally to have
been thus: -

Though the head of Syria be Damascus, And the head of Damascus Retsin
And the head of Ephraim be Samaria; And the head of Samaria Remaliah's
son: Yet within threescore and five years Ephraim shall be broken that
he be no more a people." Dr. Jubb.

Threescore and five years - It was sixty-five years from the beginning
of the reign of Ahaz, when this prophecy was delivered, to the total
depopulation of the kingdom of Israel by Esarhaddon, who carried away
the remains of the ten tribes which had been left by Tiglath-pileser,
and Shalmaneser, and who planted the country with new inhabitants. That
the country was not wholly stripped of its inhabitants by Shalmaneser
appears from many passages of the history of Josiah, where Israelites
are mentioned as still remaining there, [Ch2
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#006.md), [Ch2
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#007.md), [Ch2
34:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#033.md); [Ch2
35:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#018.md); [Kg2
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#019.md), [Kg2
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#020.md). This seems to be the best
explanation of the chronological difficulty in this place, which has
much embarrassed the commentators: see Usserii Annal. 5. T. ad an. 3327,
and Sir 1. Newton, Chronol. p. 283.

"That the last deportation of Israel by Esarhaddon was in the
sixty-fifth year after the second of Ahaz, is probable for the following
reasons: The Jews, in Seder Olam Rabba, and the Talmudists, in D. Kimchi
on Ezekiel iv., say that Manasseh king of Judah was carried to Babylon
by the king of Assyria's captains, [Ch2
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#011.md), in the twenty-second year of
his reign; that is, before Christ 676, according to Dr. Blair's tables.
And they are probably right in this. It could not be much earlier; as
the king of Assyria was not king of Babylon till 680, ibid. As
Esarhaddon was then in the neighborhood of Samaria, it is highly
probable that he did then carry away the last remains of Israel, and
brought those strangers thither who mention him as their founder, [Ezr
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#002.md). But this year is just the
sixty-fifth from the second of Ahaz, which was 740 before Christ. Now
the carrying away the remains of Israel, who, till then, though their
kingdom was destroyed forty-five years before, and though small in
number, might yet keep up some form of being a people, by living
according to their own laws, entirely put an end to the people of
Israel, as a people separate from all others: for from this time they
never returned to their own country in a body, but were confounded with
the people of Judah in the captivity; and the whole people, the ten
tribes included, were called Jews." - Dr. Jubb. Two MSS. have
twenty-five instead of sixty-five; and two others omit the word five,
reading only sixty.

If ye will not believe "If ye believe not" - "This clause is very much
illustrated by considering the captivity of Manasseh as happening at the
same time with this predicted final ruin of Ephraim as a people. The
near connection of the two facts makes the prediction of the one
naturally to cohere with the prediction of the other. And the words are
well suited to this event in the history of the people of Judah: 'If ye
believe not, ye shall not be established;' that is, unless ye believe
this prophecy of the destruction of Israel, ye Jews also, as well as the
people of Israel, shall not remain established as a kingdom and people;
ye also shall be visited with punishment at the same time: as our Savior
told the Jews in his time, 'Unless ye repent, ye shall all likewise
perish;' intimating their destruction by the Romans; to which also, as
well as to the captivity of Manasseh, and to the Babylonish captivity,
the views of the prophet might here extend. The close connection of this
threat to the Jews with the prophecy of the destruction of Israel, is
another strong proof that the order of the preceding lines above
proposed is right." - Dr. Jubb.

"If ye believe not in me." - The exhortation of Jehoshaphat, [Ch2
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#020.md), to his people, when God had
promised to them, by the prophet Jahaziel, victory over the Moabites and
Ammonites, is very like this both in sense and expression, and seems to
be delivered in verse:

"Hear me, O Judah; and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem;

Believe in Jehovah your God, and ye shall be established:

Believe his prophets, and ye shall prosper."

Where both the sense and construction render very probable a conjecture
of Archbishop Secker on this place; that instead of כי ki, we should
read בי bi. "If ye will not believe in me, ye shall not be established."
So likewise Dr. Durell. The Chaldee has, "If ye will not believe in the
words of the prophet;" which seems to be a paraphrase of the reading
here proposed. In favor of which it may be farther observed that in one
MS. כי ki is upon a rasure; and another for the last לא lo reads ולא
velo, which would properly follow בי bi, but could not follow כי ki.

Some translate thus, and paraphrase thus: If ye will not believe, surely
ye shall not be established. Or, If ye do not give credit, it is because
ye are unfaithful. Ye have not been faithful to the grace already given:
therefore ye are now incapable of crediting my promises.

That he may know "When he shall know" - "Though so much has been written
on this important passage, there is an obscurity and inconsequence which
still attends it, in the general run of all the interpretations given to
it by the most learned. And this obscure incoherence is given to it by
the false rendering of a Hebrew particle, viz., ל le, in לדעתו ledato.
This has been generally rendered, either 'that he may know,' or 'till he
know.' It is capable of either version, without doubt; but either of
these versions makes [Isa 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#015.md)
incoherent and inconsistent with [Isa
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#016.md). For [Isa
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#016.md) plainly means to give a reason
for the assertion in [Isa 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#016.md),
because it is subjoined to it by the particle כי ki, for. But it is no
reason why a child should eat butter and honey till he was at an age to
distinguish, that before that time the land of his nativity should be
free from its enemies. This latter supposition indeed implies, what is
inconsistent with the preceding assertion. For it implies, that in part
of that time of the infancy spoken of the land should not be free from
enemies, and consequently these species of delicate food could not be
attainable, as they are in times of peace. The other version, 'that he
may know,' has no meaning at all; for what sense is there in asserting,
that a child shall eat butter and honey that he may know to refuse evil
and choose good? Is there any such effect in this food? Surely not.
Besides, the child is thus represented to eat those things, which only a
state of peace produces, during its whole infancy, inconsistently with
[Isa 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#016.md), which promises a relief
from enemies only before the end of this infancy: implying plainly, that
part of it would be passed in distressful times of war and siege, which
was the state of things when the prophecy was delivered.

"But all these objections are cut off, and a clear, coherent sense is
given to this passage, by giving another sense to the particle ל le.
which never occurred to me till I saw it in Harmer's Observat., vol. i.,
p. 299. See how coherent the words of the prophet run, with how natural
a connection one clause follows another, by properly rendering this one
particle: 'Behold this Virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and thou
shalt call his name Immanuel; butter and honey, shall he eat, when he
shall know to refuse evil, and choose good. For before this child shall
know to refuse evil and choose good, the land shall be desolate, by
whose two kings thou art distressed.' Thus [Isa
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#016.md) subjoins a plain reason why the
child should eat butter and honey, the food of plentiful times, when he
came to a distinguishing age; viz., because before that time the country
of the two kings, who now distressed Judea, should be desolated; and so
Judea should recover that plenty which attends peace. That this
rendering, which gives perspicuity and rational connection to the
passage, is according to the use of the Hebrew particle, is certain.
Thus לפנות בקר liphnoth boker, 'at the appearing of morning, or when
morning appeared,' [Exo 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#027.md); לעת
האכל leeth haochel, 'at mealtime, or when it was time to eat,' [Rut
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#014.md). In the same manner, לדעתו
ledato, 'at his knowing, that is, when he knows.'

"Harmer (ibid.) has clearly shown that these articles of food are
delicacies in the East, and, as such, denote a state of plenty. See also
[Jos 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#006.md). They therefore naturally
express the plenty of the country, as a mark of peace restored to it.
Indeed, in [Isa 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#022.md) it expresses a
plenty arising from the thinness of the people; but that it signifies,
[Isa 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#015.md), a plenty arising from
deliverance from war then present, is evident; because otherwise there
is no expression of this deliverance. And that a deliverance was
intended to be here expressed is plain, from calling the child which
should be born Immanuel, God with us. It is plain, also, because it is
before given to the prophet in charge to make a declaration of the
deliverance, [Isa 7:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#003.md); and it is
there made; and this prophecy must undoubtedly be conformable to that in
this matter." - Dr. Jubb.

The circumstance of the child's eating butter and honey is explained by
Jarchi, as denoting a state of plenty: "Butter and honey shall this
child eat, because our land shall be full of all good." Comment in
locum. The infant Jupiter, says Callimachus, was tenderly nursed with
goat's milk and honey. Hymn, in Jov. 48. Homer, of the orphan daughters
of Pandareus: -

Κομισσε δε δι' Αφροδιτη

Τυρῳ και μελιτι γλυκερῳ, και ἡδει οινῳ.

Odyss. XX., 68.

"Venus in tender delicacy rears

With honey, milk, and wine, their infant years."

Pope.

Τρυφης εστιν ενδειξις; "This is a description of delicate food," says
Eustathius on the place.

Agreeably to the observations communicated by the learned person above
mentioned, which perfectly well explain the historical sense of this
much disputed passage, not excluding a higher secondary sense, the
obvious and literal meaning of the prophecy is this:" that within the
time that a young woman, now a virgin, should conceive and bring forth a
child, and that child should arrive at such an age as to distinguish
between good and evil, that is, within a few years, (compare [Isa
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#004).md), the enemies of Judah should be
destroyed." But the prophecy is introduced in so solemn a manner; the
sign is so marked, as a sign selected and given by God himself, after
Ahaz had rejected the offer of any sign of his own choosing out of the
whole compass of nature; the terms of the prophecy are so peculiar, and
the name of the child so expressive, containing in them much more than
the circumstances of the birth of a common child required, or even
admitted; that we may easily suppose that, in minds prepared by the
general expectation of a great Deliverer to spring from the house of
David, they raised hopes far beyond what the present occasion suggested;
especially when it was found, that in the subsequent prophecy, delivered
immediately afterward, this child, called Immanuel, is treated as the
Lord and Prince of the land of Judah. Who could this be, other than the
heir of the throne of David; under which character a great and even a
Divine person had been promised? No one of that age answered to this
character except Hezekiah; but he was certainly born nine or ten years
before the delivery of this prophecy. That this was so understood at
that time is collected, I think, with great probability, from a passage
of Micah, a prophet contemporary with Isaiah, but who began to prophesy
after him; and who, as I have already observed, imitated him, and
sometimes used his expressions. Micah, having delivered that remarkable
prophecy which determines the place of the birth of Messiah, "the Ruler
of God's people, whose goings forth have been of old, from everlasting;"
that it should be Bethlehem Ephratah; adds immediately, that
nevertheless, in the mean time, God would deliver his people into the
hands of their enemies: "He will give them up, till she, who is to bear
a child, shall bring forth," [Mic 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#003.md).
This obviously and plainly refers to some known prophecy concerning a
woman to bring forth a child; and seems much more properly applicable to
this passage of Isaiah than to any others of the same prophet, to which
some interpreters have applied it. St. Matthew, therefore, in applying
this prophecy to the birth of Christ, does it, not merely in the way of
accommodating the words of the prophet to a suitable case not in the
prophet's view, but takes it in its strictest, clearest, and most
important sense; and applies it according to the original design and
principal intention of the prophet. - L.

After all this learned criticism, I think something is still wanting to
diffuse the proper light over this important prophecy. On [Mat
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#023.md) I have given what I judge to be
the true meaning and right application of the whole passage, as there
quoted by the evangelist, the substance of which it will be necessary to
repeat here: -

At the time referred to, the kingdom of Judah, under the government of
Ahaz, was reduced very low. Pekah, king of Israel, had slain in Judea
one hundred and twenty thousand persons in one day; and carried away
captives two hundred thousand, including women and children, together
with much spoil. To add to their distress, Rezin, king of Syria, being
confederate with Pekah, had taken Elath, a fortified city of Judah, and
carried the inhabitants away captive to Damascus. In this critical
conjuncture, need we wonder that Ahaz was afraid that the enemies who
were now united against him must prevail, destroy Jerusalem, end the
kingdom of Judah, and annihilate the family of David? To meet and remove
this fear, apparently well grounded, Isaiah is sent from the Lord to
Ahaz, swallowed up now both by sorrow and by unbelief, in order to
assure him that the counsels of his enemies should not stand; and that
they should be utterly discomfited. To encourage Ahaz, he commands him
to ask a sign or miracle, which should be a pledge in hand, that God
should, in due time, fulfill the predictions of his servant, as related
in the context. On Ahaz humbly refusing to ask any sign, it is
immediately added, "Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign;
Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son; and shall call his name
Immanuel. Butter and honey shall he eat," etc. Both the Divine and human
nature of our Lord, as well as the miraculous conception, appear to be
pointed out in the prophecy quoted here by the evangelist: He shall be
called עמנואל Immanuel; literally, The Strong God with Us: similar to
those words in the New Testament: The word which was God - was made
flesh, and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth; [Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md), [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md). And God was manifested in the
flesh, [Ti1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016.md). So that we are to
understand God with us to imply, God incarnated - God in human nature.
This seems farther evident from the words of the prophet, [Isa
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#015.md) : Butter and honey shall he eat -
he shall be truly man - grow up and be nourished in a human natural way;
which refers to his being With Us, i.e., incarnated. To which the
prophet adds, That he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good;
or rather, According to his knowledge, לדעתו ledato, reprobating the
evil, and choosing the good; this refers to him as God, and is the same
idea given by this prophet, chap. [Isa
53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011) : By (or in.md) his knowledge,
בדעתו bedato, (the knowledge of Christ crucified), shall my righteous
servant justify many; for he shall bear their offenses. Now this union
of the Divine and human nature is termed a sign or miracle, אות oth,
i.e., something which exceeds the power of nature to produce. And this
miraculous union was to be brought about in a miraculous way: Behold, a
Virgin shall conceive: the word is very emphatic, העלמה haalmah, The
virgin; the only one that ever was, or ever shall be, a mother in this
way. But the Jews, and some called Christians, who have espoused their
desperate cause, assert that "the word עלמה almah does not signify a
Virgin only; for it is applied [Pro
30:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#019.md) to signify a young married
woman." I answer, that this latter text is no proof of the contrary
doctrine: the words דרך גבר בעלמה derech geber bealmah, the way of a man
with a maid, cannot be proved to mean that for which it is produced.
Besides, one of De Rossi's MSS. reads בעלמיו bealmaiv, the way of a
strong or stout man (גבר geber) In His Youth; and in this reading the
Syriac, Septuagint, Vulgate, and Arabic agree; which are followed by the
first version in the English language, as it stands in a MS. in my own
possession: the weie of a man in his waxing youth: so that this place,
the only one that can with any probability of success be produced, were
the interpretation contended for correct, which I am by no means
disposed to admit, proves nothing. Besides, the consent of so many
versions in the opposite meaning deprives it of much of its influence in
this question.

The word עלמה almah, comes from עלם alam, to lie hid, be concealed: and
we are told, that "virgins were so called, because they were concealed
or closely kept up in their father's houses till the time of their
marriage." This is not correct: see the case of Rebecca, [Gen
24:43](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#043) (note.md), and my note there; that
of Rachel, [Gen 29:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#006) (note.md), and the
note there also; and see the case of Miriam, the sister of Moses, [Exo
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#008.md), and also the Chaldee paraphrase
on [Lam 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#004.md), where the virgins are
represented as going out in the dance. And see also the whole history of
Ruth. This being concealed or kept at home, on which so much stress is
laid, is purely fanciful; for we find that young unmarried women drew
water, kept sheep, gleaned publicly in the fields, etc., etc., and the
same works they perform among the Turcomans to the present day. This
reason, therefore, does not account for the radical meaning of the word;
and we must seek it elsewhere. Another well-known and often-used root in
the Hebrew tongue will cast light on this subject. This is גלה galah,
which signifies to reveal, make manifest, or uncover; and is often
applied to matrimonial connections in different parts of the Mosaic law:
עלם alam, therefore, may be considered as implying the concealment of
the virgin, as such, till lawful, marriage had taken place. A virgin was
not called עלמה almah, because she was concealed by being kept at home
in her father's house, which is not true; but, literally and physically,
because as a woman she had not been uncovered - she had not known man.
This fully applies to the blessed virgin, see [Luk
1:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#034.md). "How can this be, seeing I know
no man?" And this text throws much light on the subject before us. This
also is in perfect agreement with the ancient prophecy, "The seed of the
woman shall bruise the head of the serpent," [Gen
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015.md); for the person who was to
destroy the work of the devil was to be the progeny of the woman,
without any concurrence of the man. And hence the text in Genesis speaks
as fully of the virgin state of the person from whom Christ, according
to the flesh, should come, as that in the prophet, or this in the
evangelist. According to the original promise there was to be a seed, a
human being, who should destroy sin: but this seed or human being, must
come from the woman Alone; and no woman Alone could produce such a human
being without being a virgin. Hence, A virgin shall bear a son, is the
very spirit and meaning of the original text, independently of the
illustration given by the prophet; and the fact recorded by the
evangelist is the proof of the whole. But how could that be a sign to
Ahaz which was to take place so many hundreds of years after? I answer,
the meaning of the prophet is plain: not only Rezin and Pekah should be
unsuccessful against Jerusalem at that time, which was the fact; but
Jerusalem, Judea, and the house of David should be both preserved,
notwithstanding their depressed state, and the multitude of their
adversaries, till the time should come when a Virgin should bear a son.
This is a most remarkable circumstance the house of David could never
fail, till a virgin should conceive and bear a son - nor did it: but
when that incredible and miraculous fact did take place, the kingdom and
house of David became extinct! This is an irrefragable confutation of
every argument a Jew can offer in vindication of his opposition to the
Gospel of Christ. Either the prophecy in Isaiah has been fulfilled, or
the kingdom and house of David are yet standing. But the kingdom of
David, we know, is destroyed: and where is the man, Jew or Gentile, that
can show us a single descendant of David on the face of the earth? The
prophecy could not fail: the kingdom and house of David have failed; the
virgin, therefore, must have brought forth her son, and this son is
Jesus, the Christ. Thus Moses, Isaiah, and Matthew concur; and facts the
most unequivocal have confirmed the whole! Behold the wisdom and
providence of God!

Notwithstanding what has been said above, it may be asked, In what sense
could this name, Immanuel, be applied to Jesus Christ, if he be not
truly and properly God? Could the Spirit of truth ever design that
Christians should receive him as an angel or a mere man; and yet, in the
very beginning of the Gospel history, apply a character to him which
belongs only to the most high God? Surely no. In what sense, then, is
Christ God with Us? Jesus is called Immanuel, or God with us, in his
incarnation; God united to our nature; God with man, God in man; God
with us, by his continual protection; God with us, by the influences of
his Holy Spirit, in the holy sacrament, in the preaching of his word, in
private prayer. And God with us, through every action of our life, that
we begin, continue, and end in his name. He is God with us, to comfort,
enlighten, protect, and defend us, in every time of temptation and
trial, in the hour of death, in the day of judgment; and God with us and
in us, and we with and in him, to all eternity.

[Isa 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#017.md)

The Lord shall bring "But Jehovah will bring" - Houbigant reads וביא
vaiyabi, from the Septuagint, αλλα επαξει ὁ Θεος, to mark the transition
to a new subject.

Even the king of Assyria - Houbigant supposes these words to have been a
marginal gloss, brought into the text by mistake; and so likewise
Archbishop Secker. Besides their having no force or effect here, they do
not join well in construction with the words preceding, as may be seen
by the strange manner in which the ancient interpreters have taken them;
and they very inelegantly forestall the mention of the king of Assyria,
which comes in with great propriety in the 20th verse ([Isa
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#020).md). I have therefore taken the
liberty of omitting them in the translation.

[Isaiah 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 7:18</span></span>

Hiss for the fly "Hist the fly" - See note on [Isa
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#026.md).

Egypt, and - Assyria - Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, Pharaoh-necho, and
Nebuchadnezzar, who one after another desolated Judea.

Holes of the rocks "Caverns" - So the Septuagint, Syriac, and Vulgate,
whence Houbigant supposes the true reading to be הנחללים hannachalolim.
One of my oldest MSS. reads הנחלולים hannochalolim.

The river - That is, the Euphrates: הנהר hanahar. So read the Septuagint
and two MSS.

Shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired "Jehovah shall shave by
the hired razor" - To shave with the hired razor the head, the feet, and
the beard, is an expression highly parabolical, to denote the utter
devastation of the country from one end to the other; and the plundering
of the people, from the highest to the lowest, by the Assyrians, whom
God employed as his instrument to punish the Jews. Ahaz himself, in the
first place, hired the king of Assyria to come to help him against the
Syrians, by a present made to him of all the treasures of the temple, as
well as his own. And God himself considered the great nations, whom he
thus employed as his mercenaries; and paid them their wages. Thus he
paid Nebuchadnezzar for his services against Tyre, by the conquest of
Egypt, [Eze 29:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#018.md). The hairs of the
head are those of the highest order in the state; those of the feet, or
the lower parts, are the common people; the beard is the king, the high
priest, the very supreme in dignity and majesty. The Eastern people have
always held the beard in the highest veneration, and have been extremely
jealous of its honor. To pluck a man's beard is an instance of the
greatest indignity that can be offered. See [Isa
50:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#006.md). The king of the Ammonites, to
show the utmost contempt of David, "cut off half the beards of his
servants, and the men were greatly ashamed; and David bade them tarry at
Jericho till their beards were grown," [Sa2
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#004.md), [Sa2
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#006.md). Niebuhr, Arabie, p. 275, gives a
modern instance of the very same kind of insult. "The Turks," says
Thevenot, "greatly esteem a man who has a fine beard; it is a very great
affront to take a man by his beard, unless it be to kiss it; they swear
by the beard." Voyages, i., p. 57. D'Arvieux gives a remarkable instance
of an Arab, who, having received a wound in his jaw, chose to hazard his
life, rather than suffer his surgeon to take off his beard. Memoires,
tom. iii., p. 214. See also Niebuhr, Arabie, p. 61.

The remaining verses of this chapter, [Isa
7:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#021.md), contain an elegant and very
expressive description of a country depopulated, and left to run wild,
from its adjuncts and circumstances: the vineyards and cornfields,
before well cultivated, now overrun with briers and thorns; much grass,
so that the few cattle that are left, a young cow and two sheep, have
their full range, and abundant pasture, so as to yield milk in plenty to
the scanty family of the owner; the thinly scattered people living, not
on corn, wine, and oil, the produce of cultivation; but on milk and
honey, the gifts of nature; and the whole land given up to the wild
beasts, so that the miserable inhabitants are forced to go out armed
with bows and arrows, either to defend themselves against the wild
beasts, or to supply themselves with necessary food by hunting.

A Very judicious friend has sent me the following observations on the
preceding prophecy, which I think worthy of being laid before the
reader; though they are in some respects different from my own view of
the subject.

"To establish the primary and literal meaning of a passage of Scripture
is evidently laying the true foundation for any subsequent views or
improvements from it.

"The kingdom of Judah, under the government of Ahaz, was reduced very
low. Pekah, king of Israel, had slain in Judea one hundred and twenty
thousand in one day; and carried away captive two hundred thousand
including women and children, with much spoil. To add to this distress,
Rezin, king of Syria, being confederate with Pekah, had taken Elath, a
fortified city of Judah, and carried the inhabitants to Damascus. I
think it may also be gathered from the sixth verse of chap. 8, that the
kings of Syria and Israel had a considerable party in the land of Judea,
who, regardless of the Divine appointment and promises, were disposed to
favor the elevation of Tabeal, a stranger, to the throne of David.

"In this critical conjuncture of affairs, Isaiah was sent with a message
of mercy, and a promise of deliverance, to Ahaz. He was commanded to
take with him Shearjashub, his son whose name contained a promise
respecting the captives lately made by Pekah, whose return from Samaria,
effected by the expostulation of the prophet Oded and the concurrence of
the princes of Ephraim, was now promised as a pledge of the Divine
interposition offered to Ahaz in favor of the house of David. And as a
farther token of this preservation, notwithstanding the incredulity of
Ahaz, Isaiah was directed to predict the birth of another son which
should be born to him within the space of a year, and to be named
Emmanuel, signifying thereby the protection of God to the land of Judah
and family of David at this present conjuncture, with reference to the
promise of the Messiah who was to spring from that family, and be born
in that land. Compare [Isa 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#008.md). Hence
Isaiah testifies, [Isa 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#018.md) : 'Behold,
I and the children whom the Lord hath given me are for signs and for
types in Israel.' Compare [Zac 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#008.md) :
'Thy companions are men of sign and type:' see Dr. Lowth on this verse.
The message of Divine displeasure against Israel is in like manner
expressed by the names the prophet Hosea was directed to give his
children; see [Hos 1:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001.md) and 2.

"Concerning this child, who was to be named Immanuel, the prophet was
commissioned to declare, that notwithstanding the present scarcity
prevailing in the land from its being harassed by war, yet within the
space of time wherein this child should be of age to discern good and
evil, both these hostile kings, viz., of Israel and Syria, should be cut
off; and the country enjoy such plenty, that butter and honey, food
accounted of peculiar delicacy, should be a common repast. See Harmer's
Observations, p. 299.

"To this it may be objected that Isaiah's son was not named Immanuel,
but Maher-shalal-hash-baz; the signification of which bore a threatening
aspect, instead of a consolatory one. To this I think a satisfactory
answer may be given. Ahaz, by his unbelief and disregard of the message
of mercy sent to him from God, (for instead of depending upon it he sent
and made a treaty with the king of Assyria), drew upon himself the
Divine displeasure, which was expressed by the change of the child's
name, and the declaration that though Damascus and Samaria should,
according to the former prediction, fall before the king of Assyria, yet
that this very power, i.e., Assyria, in whom Ahaz trusted for
deliverance, (see [Kg2 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#007), etc..md),
should afterwards come against Judah, and 'fill the breadth of the
land,' which was accomplished in the following reign, when Jerusalem was
so endangered as to be delivered only by miracle. The sixth and seventh
verses of chap. 8 indicate, I think, as I before observed, that the
kings of Syria and Israel had many adherents in Judah, who are said to
refuse the peaceful waters of Shiloah or Siloam, him that is to be sent,
who ought to have been their confidence, typified by the fountain at the
foot of Mount Zion, whose stream watered the city of Jerusalem; and
therefore, since the splendor of victory, rather than the blessings of
peace, was the object of their admiration, compared to a swelling river
which overflowed its banks, God threatens to chastise them by the
victorious armies of Ashur. The prophet at the same time addresses words
of consolation to such of the people who yet feared and trusted in
Jehovah, whom he instructs and comforts with the assurance ([Isa
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#010).md) that they shall prove the
fulfillment of the promise contained in the name Immanuel.

"But it may still be objected, that according to this interpretation of
the fourteenth verse of chap. 7 nothing miraculous occurs, which is
readily admitted; but the objection rests upon the supposition that
something miraculous was intended; whereas the word אות oth, 'sign,'
does by no means generally imply a miracle, but most commonly an
emblematic representation, (see [Eze
4:3-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#003.md); 11; [Eze
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#020.md); [Zac
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#014).md), either by actions or names, of
some future event either promised or threatened. [Exo
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#012.md); [Sa1
2:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#034.md); [Kg2
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#029.md); [Jer
44:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#029.md), [Jer
44:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#030.md), are all examples of a future
event given as a sign or token of something else which is also future.
The birth of Isaiah's son was indeed typical of him whose name he was,
at first, appointed to bear, viz., Immanuel, even as Oshea the son of
Nun had his name changed to Jehoshua, the same with Jesus, of whom he
was an eminent type. Hence the prophet, in the ninth chapter, breaks
forth into a strain of exultation: 'To us a child is born;' after which
follow denunciations against Rezin and the kingdom of Israel, which are
succeeded by declarations, that when Assyria had completed the appointed
chastisement upon Judah and Jerusalem, that empire should be destroyed.
The whole of the tenth chapter is a very remarkable prophecy, and was
probably delivered about the time of Sennacherib's invasion.

"But still it will be urged, that St. Matthew, when relating the
miraculous conception of our Lord, says, 'Now all this was done that it
might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet,' etc. To
this it may readily be answered, that what was spoken by the prophet was
indeed now fulfilled in a higher, more important, and also in a more
literal sense, than the primary fulfillment could afford, which derived
all its value from its connection with this event, to which it
ultimately referred.

"In like manner the prophecy of Isaiah, contained in the second chapter,
received a complete fulfillment in our Savior's honoring Capernaum with
his residence, and preaching throughout Galilee; though there appears
reason to interpret the passage as having a primary respect to the
reformation wrought by Hezekiah and which, at the eve of the dissolution
of the kingdom of Israel by the captivity of the ten tribes, extended to
the tribes of Asher and Zebulun, and many of the inhabitants of Ephraim
and Manasseh, who were hereby stirred up to destroy idolatry in their
country. See [Ch2 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#001.md). And without
doubt the great deliverance wrought afterwards for Judah by the
miraculous destruction of Sennacherib's army, and the recovery of
Hezekiah in so critical a conjuncture from a sickness which had been
declared to be unto death, contributed not a little to revive the fear
of God in that part of Israel which, through their defection from the
house of David, had grievously departed from the temple and worship of
the true God; and as Galilee lay contiguous to countries inhabited by
Gentiles, they had probably sunk deeper into idolatry than the southern
part of Israel.

"In several passages of St. Matthew's Gospel, our translation conveys
the idea of things being done in order to fulfill certain prophecies;
but I apprehend that if the words ἱνα και ὁπως were rendered as simply
denoting the event, so that and thus was fulfilled, the sense would be
much clearer. For it is obvious that our Lord did not speak in parables
or ride into Jerusalem previously to his last passover, simply for the
purpose of fulfilling the predictions recorded, but also from other
motives; and in chap. 2 the evangelist only remarks that the
circumstance of our Lord's return from Egypt corresponded with the
prophet Hosea's relation of that part of the history of the Israelites.
So in the twenty-third verse Joseph dwelt at Nazareth because he was
directed so to do by God himself; and the sacred historian, having
respect to the effect afterwards produced, (see [Joh
7:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#041.md), [Joh
7:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#042.md), [Joh
7:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#052).md), remarks that this abode in
Nazareth was a means of fulfilling those predictions of the prophets
which indicate the contempt and neglect with which by many the Messiah
should be treated. Galilee was considered by the inhabitants of Judea as
a degraded place, chiefly from its vicinity to the Gentiles; and
Nazareth seems to have been proverbially contemptible; and from the
account given of the spirit and conduct of the inhabitants by the
evangelists, not without reason." - E. M. B.

To my correspondent, as well as to many learned men, there appears some
difficulty in the text; but I really think this is quite done away by
that mode of interpretation which I have already adopted; and as far as
the miraculous conception is concerned, the whole is set in the clearest
and strongest light, and the objections and cavils of the Jeers entirely
destroyed.
