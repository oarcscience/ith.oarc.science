### [Ezekiel Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 18:0</span></span>

The Jews, in Ezekiel's time, complained of God's dealing hardly with
them in punishing them for the sins of their forefathers, [Eze
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#001.md), [Eze
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#002.md); their temporal calamities having
been long threatened as the consequence of the national guilt, ([Jer
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#004), etc..md); and, from the general
complexion of this chapter, it appears that the Jews so interpreted the
second commandment of the Decalogue and other passages of like import,
as if the sins of the forefathers were visited upon the children,
independently of the moral conduct of the latter, not only in this
world, but in that which is to come. To remove every foundation for such
an unworthy idea of the Divine government, God assures them, with an
oath, that he had no respect of persons, [Eze
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#003.md), [Eze
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#004.md); strongly intimating that the
great mysteries in Providence, (mysterious only on account of the
limited capacity of man), are results of the most impartial
administration of justice; and that this would be particularly
manifested in the rewards and punishments of another life; when every
ligament that at present connects societies and nations together shall
be dissolved, and each person receive according to his work, and bear
his own burden. This is illustrated by a variety of examples: such as
that of a just or righteous man, [Eze
18:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#005.md); his wicked son, [Eze
18:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#010.md); and again the just son of
this wicked person, [Eze 18:14-20](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#014.md).
Then a wicked man repenting, and finding mercy, whose former wickedness
shall be no impediment to his salvation, [Eze
18:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#021.md); and a righteous man
revolting, and dying in his sins, whose former righteousness shall be of
no avail, [Eze 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#024.md). The conduct of
the Divine Providence is then vindicated, [Eze
18:25-29](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#025.md); and all persons, without any
exception, most earnestly exhorted to repentance, [Eze
18:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#030.md), [Eze
18:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#031.md); because the Lord hath no
pleasure in the death of the sinner, [Eze
18:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#032.md). As the whole of this chapter is
taken up with the illustration of a doctrine nearly connected with the
comfort of man, and the honor of the Divine government, the prophet,
with great propriety, lays aside his usual mode of figure and allegory,
and treats his subject with the utmost plainness and perspicuity.

[Ezekiel 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 18:2</span></span>

The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on
edge? - We have seen this proverb already, [Jer
31:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#029.md), etc., and have considered its
general meaning. But the subject is here proposed in greater detail,
with a variety of circumstances, to adapt it to all those cases to which
it should apply. It refers simply to these questions: How far can the
moral evil of the parent be extended to his offspring? And, Are the
faults and evil propensities of the parents, not only transferred to the
children, but punished in them? Do parents transfer their evil nature,
and are their children punished for their offenses?

[Ezekiel 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 18:3</span></span>

As I live, saith the Lord God, ye shall not have occasion any more to
use this proverb in Israel - I will now, by this present declaration,
settle this question for ever. And hence God has sworn to what follows.
After this, who will dare to doubt the judgment pronounced?

[Ezekiel 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 18:4</span></span>

All souls are mine - Equally so; I am the Father of the spirits of all
flesh, and shall deal impartially with the whole.

The soul that sinneth, it shall die - None shall die for another's
crimes, none shall be saved by another's righteousness. Here is the
general judgment relative to the righteousness and unrighteousness of
men, and the influence of one man's state on that of another;
particularly in respect to their moral conduct.

[Ezekiel 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 18:5</span></span>

If a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right - If he be just
or holy within, and do what is according to law and equity. What is
meant by this, is immediately specified.

[Ezekiel 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 18:6</span></span>

1\.

Hath not eaten upon the mountains - Idolatrous worship was generally
performed on mountains and hills; and those who offered sacrifices
feasted on the sacrifice, and thus held communion with the idol.

2\.

Neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols - Has paid them no
religious adoration; has trusted in them for nothing, and has not made
prayer nor supplication before them.

3\.

Neither hath defiled his neighbor's wife - Has had no adulterous
connection with any woman; to which idolatrous feasts and worship
particularly led.

4\.

Neither hath come nigh to a menstruous woman - Has abstained from the
use of the marriage-bed during the periodical indisposition of his wife.
This was absolutely forbidden by the law; and both the man and the woman
who disobeyed the command were to be put to death, [Lev
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#018.md). For which Calmet gives this
reason: "It has been believed, and experience confirms it, that the
children conceived at such times are either leprous, or monsters, or
deformed by their diminutiveness, or by the disproportion of their
members." There are other reasons for this law, should those of the
learned commentator be found invalid.

[Ezekiel 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 18:7</span></span>

5\.

Hath not oppressed any - Has not used his power or influence to oppress,
pain, or injure another.

6\.

Hath restored to the debtor his pledge - Has carefully surrendered the
pawn or pledge when its owner came to redeem it. As the pledge is
generally of more worth than that for which it is pledged, an
unprincipled man will make some pretense to keep it; which is highly
abominable in the sight of God.

7\.

Hath spoiled none by violence - Either by robbery or personal insult.
For a man may be spoiled both ways.

8\.

Hath given his bread to the hungry - Has been kind-hearted and
charitable; especially to them that are in the deepest want.

9\.

Hath covered the naked with a garment - Has divided both his bread and
his clothing with the necessitous. These are two branches of the same
root.

[Ezekiel 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 18:8</span></span>

10\.

Hath not given forth upon usury - בנשך לא יתן beneshech lo yitten. נשך
nasach signifies to bite; usury is properly so termed, because it bites
into and devours the principal. Usury signifies, with us, exacting
unlawful interest for money; and taking the advantage of a man's
necessities to advance him cash on exorbitant profit. This bites the
receiver in his property, and the lender in his salvation.

11\.

Neither hath taken any increase - In lending has not required more than
was lent; and has not taken that product of the cash lent, which was
more than the value for its use. This may be a part of the tenth
article.

12\.

That hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity - Never associates with those
who act contrary to justice and equity; his hand or influence being
never found among evil workers.

13\.

Hath executed true judgment between man and man - Being neither swayed
by prejudice, fear, nor favor.

These thirteen points concern his social and civil relations.

[Ezekiel 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 18:9</span></span>

Hath walked in my statutes - Not only acknowledging them to be right,
but acting according to them. Especially in every thing that relates to
my worship, changing nothing, neglecting nothing.

And hath kept my judgments, to deal truly - Has attended to my Divine
direction, both with respect to things forbidden, and things commanded.
These concern men in their religious conduct.

He is just - צדיק הוא tsaddik hu. He is a righteous man; he has given to
all their due; he has abstained from every appearance of evil, and done
that which was lawful and right in the sight of God.

He shall surely live - He has lived to me, and he shall live with me.

[Ezekiel 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 18:10</span></span>

If he beget a son - Who is the reverse of the above righteous character,
according to the thirteen articles already specified and explained.

[Ezekiel 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 18:13</span></span>

Shall he then live? - Because his father was a righteous man, shall the
father's holiness be imputed to him? No!

He shad surely die; his blood shall be upon him - He shall suffer for
his own crimes.

[Ezekiel 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 18:14</span></span>

Now, lo, if he beget a son that seeth all his father's sins - and
considereth - Lays to heart the evil of his father's life, and the
dreadful consequences of a life of rebellion against God.

And doeth not such like - Is quite a different man in moral feeling and
character; and acts up to the thirteen points already laid down.

[Ezekiel 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 18:17</span></span>

He shall not die for the iniquity of his father - He shall no more be
affected by his father's crimes, than his father was benefited by his
grandfather's righteousness.

[Ezekiel 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 18:20</span></span>

The soul that sinneth, it shall die - Hitherto we have had to do with
the simple cases or the righteous and the wicked; of him who lived and
died a holy man, and of him who lived and died a wicked man. But there
are two cases behind:

1\. That of the wicked man, who repents and turns to God.

2\. That of the righteous man, who backslides, and does not return to
God by repentance. On both these cases God decides thus: -

[Ezekiel 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 18:21</span></span>

But if the wicked will turn from all his sins - And afterwards walk
according to the character of the righteous already specified shall he
find mercy, and be for ever saved? Yes.

[Ezekiel 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 18:22</span></span>

All his transgressions - Shall be so completely forgiven by God's mercy,
that they shall not be even mentioned to him; and if he live and die in
this recovered state, he shall live with God to all eternity. And why?
Hear the reason: -

[Ezekiel 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 18:23</span></span>

Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? - No! That is
foreign to him whose name is love, and whose nature is mercy. On the
contrary he "wills that he should return from his evil ways and live."

And if God can have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, he cannot
have made a decree to abandon him to the evil of his nature, and then
damn him for what he could not avoid: for as God can do nothing with
which he is not pleased, so he can decree nothing with which he is not
pleased. But he is "not pleased with the death of a sinner," therefore
he cannot have made a decree to bring him to this death.

[Ezekiel 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 18:24</span></span>

When the righteous turneth away from his righteousness - Here is the
second case. Can a man who was once holy and pure fall away so as to
perish everlastingly? Yes. For God says, "If he turn away from his
righteousness;" not his self-righteousness, the gloss of theologians:
for God never speaks of turning away from that, for, in his eyes, that
is a nonentity. There is no righteousness or holiness but what himself
infuses into the soul of man, and as to self-righteousness, i.e., a
man's supposing himself to be righteous when he has not the life of God
in his soul, it is the delusion of a dark and hardened heart; therefore
it is the real righteous principle and righteous practice that God
speaks of here. And he tells us, that al man may so "turn away from
this," and so "commit iniquity," and "act as the wicked man," that his
righteousness shall be no more mentioned to his account, than the sins
of the penitent backslider should be mentioned to his condemnation; and
"in the sin that he" this once righteous man, "hath sinned, and in the
trespass that he hath trespassed, in them shall he die." O, how awful a
termination of a life once distinguished for righteousness and true
holiness! So then, God himself informs us that a righteous man may not
only fall foully, but fall finally. But to such righteous persons the
devil will ever preach, "Ye shall not surely die; ye shall be as God."
Touch, taste, and handle; ye cannot ultimately fall. Thus we find, by
the manner of treating these two cases, that God's way is equal, [Eze
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#025.md); just, merciful, and impartial.
And to prove this, he sums up his conduct in the above cases, in the
following [Eze 18:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#026.md). And then,
that the "wicked may not die in his sins," and that the "backslider may
return and find mercy," he thus exhorts: -

[Ezekiel 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">eze 18:30</span></span>

Repent, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions - There is
still life; still a God that has no pleasure in the death of a sinner.
one who is ever ready to give his Holy Spirit to all them that ask him;
therefore "repent and turn, so iniquity shall not be your ruin."

[Ezekiel 18:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">eze 18:31</span></span>

Cast away - With a holy violence, dash away every transgression and
incentive to it.

Make you a new heart - Call upon God for it, and he will give it: for as
sure as you earnestly call on God through Christ to save you, so surely
you shall be saved; and the effect will so speedily follow, that God is
pleased to attribute that in some sort to yourselves, which is done by
his grace alone; because ye earnestly call upon him for it, come in the
right way to receive it, and are determined never to rest till you have
it.

For why will ye die - Who should you go to hell while the kingdom of God
is open to receive you? Why should you be the devil's slaves, when ye
may be Christ's freemen! Why Will Ye Die? Every word is emphatic.

Why - show God or man one reason. Will - obstinacy alone, - a
determination not to be saved, or a voluntary listlessness about
salvation, - can prevent you. Ye - children of so many mercies, fed and
supported by a kind God all your life; ye, who are redeemed by the blood
of Jesus Christ; ye, who have made many promises to give up yourselves
to God; ye, who have been dedicated to the ever-blessed Trinity, and
promised to renounce the devil and all his works, the pomps and vanities
of this wicked world, and all the sinful lusts of the flesh; why will Ye
die? Die! - what is this? A separation from God and the glory of his
power for ever! Die! - forfeiting all the purposes for which your
immortal souls were made! Die - to know what the worm is that never
dieth, and what that fire is which is never quenched! Why will ye die?

[Ezekiel 18:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">eze 18:32</span></span>

For I have no pleasure - God repeats what he had so solemnly declared
before. Can ye doubt his sincerity? his ability? his willingness? the
efficacy of the blood of his covenant?

Wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye - Reader, now give God thy heart.

Though every man comes into the world with a fallen nature - a soul
infected with sin, yet no man is damned on that account. He who refuses
that grace which pardons sin and heals infected nature, who permits the
evil principle to break out into transgression, and continues and dies
in his iniquity and sin, and will not come unto Christ that he may have
life; he, and he only, goes to perdition. Nor will the righteousness of
a parent or relation help his sinful soul: no man can have more grace
than is necessary to save himself; and none can have that, who does not
receive it through Christ Jesus. It is the mercy of God in Christ which
renders the salvation of a sinner possible; and it is that mercy alone
which can heal the backslider. The atoning blood blots out all that is
past; the same blood cleanses from all unrighteousness. Who believes so
as to apply for this redemption? Who properly thanks God for having
provided such a Savior?
