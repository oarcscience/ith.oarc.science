### [Psalms Chapter 88](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 88:0</span></span>

The earnest prayer of a person in deep distress, abandoned by his
friends and neighbors, and apparently forsaken of God, vv. 1-18.

Perhaps the title of this Psalm, which is difficult enough, might be
thus translated: "A Poem to be sung to the conqueror, by the sons of
Korah, responsively, in behalf of a distressed person; to give
instruction to Heman the Ezrahite." Kennicott says this Psalm has three
titles, but the last only belongs to it; and supposes it to be the
prayer of a person shut up in a separate house, because of the leprosy,
who seems to have been in the last stages of that distemper; this
disease, under the Mosaic dispensation, being supposed to come from the
immediate stroke of God. Calmet supposes it to refer to the captivity;
the Israelitish nation being represented here under the figure of a
person greatly afflicted through the whole course of his life. By some
Heman is supposed to have been the author; but who he was is not easy to
be determined. Heman and Ethan whose names are separately prefixed to
this and the following Psalm, are mentioned as the grandsons of Judah by
his daughter-in-law Tamar, [Ch1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#006.md),
for they were the sons of Zerah, his immediate son by the above. "And
Tamar, his daughter-in-law, bare him Pharez and Zerah," [Ch1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#004.md). "And the sons of Zerah Zimri, and
Ethan, and Heman, and Calcol, and Dara, (or Darda)," [Ch1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#006.md). If these were the same persons
mentioned [Kg1 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#031.md), they were eminent
in wisdom; for it is there said that Solomon's wisdom "excelled the
wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of
Egypt. For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and
Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol," [Kg1
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#030.md), [Kg1
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#031.md). Probably Zerah was also called
Mahol. If the Psalms in question were written by these men, they are the
oldest poetical compositions extant; and the most ancient part of Divine
revelation, as these persons lived at least one hundred and seventy
years before Moses. This may be true of the seventy-eighth Psalm; but
certainly not of the following, as it speaks of transactions that took
place long afterwards, at least as late as the days of David, who is
particularly mentioned in it. Were we sure of Heman as the author, there
would be no difficulty in applying the whole of the Psalm to the state
of the Hebrews in Egypt, persecuted and oppressed by Pharaoh. But to
seek or labor to reconcile matters contained in the titles to the
Psalms, is treating them with too much respect, as many of them are
wrongly placed, and none of them Divinely inspired.

[Psalms 88:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 88:1</span></span>

O Lord God of my salvation - This is only the continuation of prayers
and supplications already often sent up to the throne of grace.

[Psalms 88:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 88:2</span></span>

Let my prayer come before thee - It is weak and helpless, though fervent
and sincere: take all hinderances out of its way, and let it have a free
passage to thy throne. One of the finest thoughts in the Iliad of Homer
concerns prayer; I shall transcribe a principal part of this
incomparable passage - incomparable when we consider its origin: -

Και γαρ τε Λιται εισι Διος κουραι μεγαλοιο,

Χωλαι τε, ῥυσσαι τε, παραβλωπες τ' οφθαλμω·

Αἱ ῥα τε και μετοπισθ' Ατης αλεγουσι κιουσαι·

Ἡ δ' Ατη σθεναρη τε και αρτιπος· οὑνεκα πασας

Πολλον ὑπεκπροθεει, φθανει δε τε πασαν επ' αιαν,

Βλαπτους' ανθρωπους· αἱ δ' εξακεονται ποισσω·

Ὁς μεν τ' αιδεσεται κουρας Διος, ασσον ιουσας,

Τονδε μεγ' ωνησαν, και τ' εκλυον ευξαμενοιο.

Ὁς δε κ' ανῃνηται, και τε στερεως αποειπῃ,

Λισσονται δ' αρα ταιγε Δια Κρονιωνα κιουσαι,

Τῳ Ατην ἁμ' ἑπεσθαι, ἱνα βλαφθεις αποτιση.

Αλλ', Αχιλευ, πορε και συ Διος κουρησιν ἑπεσθαι

Τιμην, ῃτ' αλλων περ επιγναμπτει φρενας εσθλων.

Iliad., 9:498-510.

Prayers are Jove's daughters; wrinkled, lame, slant-eyed,

Which, though far distant, yet with constant pace

Follow offense. Offence, robust of limb,

And treading firm the ground, outstrips them all,

And over all the earth, before them runs

Hurtful to man: they, following, heal the hurt.

Received respectfully when they approach,

They yield us aid, and listen when we pray.

But if we slight, and with obdurate heart

Resist them, to Saturnian Jove they cry.

Against, us supplicating, that offense

May cleave to us for vengeance of the wrong.

Thou, therefore, O Achilles! honor yield

To Jove's own daughters, vanquished as the brave

Have ofttimes been, by honor paid to thee.

Cowper.

On this allegory the translator makes the following remarks: "Wrinkled,
because the countenance of a man, driven to prayer by a consciousness of
guilt, is sorrowful and dejected. Lame, because it is a remedy to which
men recur late, and with reluctance. Slant-eyed, either because in that
state of humiliation they fear to lift up their eyes to heaven, or are
employed in taking a retrospect of their past misconduct. The whole
allegory, considering when and where it was composed, forms a very
striking passage." Prayer to God for mercy must have the qualifications
marked above.

Prayer comes from God. He desires to save us: this desire is impressed
on our hearts by his Spirit, and reflected back to himself. Thus says
the allegory, "Prayers are the daughters of Jupiter." But they are lame,
as reflected light is much less intense and vivid than light direct. The
desire of the heart is afraid to go into the presence of God, because
the man knows, feels, that he has sinned against goodness and mercy.
They are wrinkled - dried up and withered, with incessant longing: even
the tears that refresh the soul are dried up and exhausted. They are
slant-eyed; look aside through shame and confusion; dare not look God in
the face. But transgression is strong, bold, impudent, and destructive:
it treads with a firm step over the earth, bringing down curses on
mankind. Prayer and repentance follow, but generally at a distance. The
heart, being hardened by the deceitfulness of sin does not speedily
relent. They, however, follow: and when, with humility and contrition,
they approach the throne of grace, they are respectfully received. God
acknowledges them as his offspring, and heals the wounds made by
transgression. If the heart remain obdurate, and the man will not humble
himself before his God, then his transgression cleaves to him, and the
heartless, lifeless prayers which he may offer in that state, presuming
on God's mercy, will turn against him; and to such a one the sacrificial
death and mediation of Christ are in vain. And this will be the case
especially with the person who, having received an offense from another,
refuses to forgive. This latter circumstance is that to which the poet
particularly refers. See the whole passage, with its context.

[Psalms 88:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 88:4</span></span>

I am counted with them, etc. - I am as good as dead; nearly destitute of
life and hope.

[Psalms 88:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 88:5</span></span>

Free among the dead - במתים צפשי bammethim chophshi, I rather think,
means stripped among the dead. Both the fourth and fifth verses seem to
allude to a field of battle: the slain and the wounded, are found
scattered over the plain; the spoilers come among them, and strip, not
only the dead, but those also who appear to be mortally wounded, and
cannot recover, and are so feeble as not to be able to resist. Hence the
psalmist says, "I am counted with them that go down into the pit; I am
as a man that hath no strength," [Psa
88:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#004.md). And I am stripped among the
dead, like the mortally wounded (חללים chalalim) that lie in the grave.
"Free among the dead," inter mortuos liber, has been applied by the
fathers to our Lord's voluntary death: all others were obliged to die,
he alone gave up his life, and could take it again, [Joh
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#018.md). He went into the grave, and
came out when he chose. The dead are bound in the grave; he was free,
and not obliged to continue in that state as they were.

They are cut off from thy hand - An allusion to the roll in which the
general has the names of all that compose his army under their
respective officers. And when one is killed, he is erased from this
register, and remembered no more, as belonging to the army; but his name
is entered among those who are dead, in a separate book. This latter is
termed the black book, or the book of death; the other is called the
book of life, or the book where the living are enrolled. From this
circumstance, expressed in different parts of the sacred writings, the
doctrine of unconditional reprobation and election has been derived. How
wonderful!

[Psalms 88:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 88:7</span></span>

Thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves - The figures in this verse
seem to be taken from a tempest at sea. The storm is fierce, and the
waves cover the ship.

[Psalms 88:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 88:8</span></span>

Thou hast made me an abonmination - This verse has been supposed to
express the state of a leper, who, because of the infectious nature of
his disease, is separated from his family - is abominable to all, and at
last shut up in a separate house, whence he does not come out to mingle
with society.

[Psalms 88:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 88:10</span></span>

Wilt thou show wonders to the dead! - מתים methim, dead men.

Shall the dead - רפאים rephaim, "the manes or departed spirits."

Arise and praise thee? - Any more in this life? The interrogations in
this and the two following verses imply the strongest negations.

[Psalms 88:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 88:11</span></span>

Or thy faithfulness in destruction? - Faithfulness in God refers as well
to his fulfilling his threatenings as to his keeping his promises. The
wicked are threatened with such punishments as their crimes have
deserved; but annihilation is no punishment. God therefore does not
intend to annihilate the wicked; their destruction cannot declare the
faithfulness of God.

[Psalms 88:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 88:12</span></span>

The land of forgetfulness? - The place of separate spirits, or the
invisible world. The heathens had some notion of this state. They
feigned a river in the invisible world, called Lethe, Ληθη, which
signifies oblivion, and that those who drank of it remembered no more
any thing relative to their former state.

\- Animae, quibus altera fato

Corpora debentur, lethaei ad fluminis undam

Securos latices et longa oblivia potant.

Virg. Aen. 6: 713.

To all those souls who round the river wait

New mortal bodies are decreed by fate;

To yon dark stream the gliding ghosts repair,

And quaff deep draughts of long oblivion there.

[Psalms 88:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 88:13</span></span>

Shall my prayer prevent thee - It shall get before thee; I will not wait
till the accustomed time to offer my morning sacrifice, I shall call on
thee long before others come to offer their devotions.

[Psalms 88:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 88:14</span></span>

Why castest thou off my soul? - Instead of my soul, several of the
ancient Versions have my prayer. Why dost thou refuse to hear me, and
thus abandon me to death?

[Psalms 88:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 88:15</span></span>

From my youth up - I have always been a child of sorrow, afflicted in my
body, and distressed in my mind. There are still found in the Church of
God persons in similar circumstances; persons who are continually
mourning for themselves and for the desolations of Zion. A disposition
of this kind is sure to produce an unhealthy body; and indeed a weak
constitution may often produce an enfeebled mind; but where the terrors
of the Lord prevail, there is neither health of body nor peace of mind.

[Psalms 88:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 88:16</span></span>

Thy fierce wrath goeth over me - It is a mighty flood by which I am
overwhelmed.

[Psalms 88:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 88:17</span></span>

They came round about me daily like water - Besides his spiritual
conflicts, he had many enemies to grapple with. The waves of God's
displeasure broke over him, and his enemies came around him like water,
increasing more and more, rising higher and higher, till he was at last
on the point of being submerged in the flood.

[Psalms 88:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 88:18</span></span>

Lover and friend - I have no comfort, and neither friend nor neiphbour
to sympathize with me.

Mine acquaintance into darkness - All have forsaken me; or מידעי מחשך
meyuddai machsach, "Darkness is my companion." Perhaps he may refer to
the death of his acquaintances; all were gone; there was none left to
console him! That man has a dismal lot who has outlived all his old
friends and acquaintances; well may such complain. In the removal of
their friends they see little else than the triumphs of death. Khosroo,
an eminent Persian poet, handles this painful subject with great
delicacy and beauty in the following lines: -

Ruftem sauee khuteereh bekerestem bezar

Az Hijereh Doostan ke aseer fana shudend:

Guftem Eeshah Kuja shudend? ve Khatyr

Dad az sada jouab Eeshan Kuja!

"Weeping, I passed the place where lay my friends

Captured by death; in accents wild I cried,

Where are they? And stern Fate, by Echoes voice,

Returned in solemn sound the sad Where are they?"

J. B. C.
