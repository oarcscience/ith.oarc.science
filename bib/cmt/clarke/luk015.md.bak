### [Luke Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#001.md)

[Luke](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">luk 15:0</span></span>

Publicans and sinners draw near to hear our Lord, at which the Pharisees
are offended, [Luk 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#001.md), [Luk
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#002.md). Christ vindicates his conduct in
receiving them by the parable of the lost sheep, [Luk
15:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#003.md). The parable of the lost piece
of money, [Luk 15:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#008.md); and the
affecting parable of the prodigal son, vv. 11-32.

[Luke 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 15:1</span></span>

Publicans and sinners - Τελωναι και ἁμαρτωλοι, tax-gatherers and
heathens; persons who neither believed in Christ nor in Moses. See the
note on [Luk 7:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#036.md). Concerning the
tax-gatherers, see the note on [Mat
5:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#046.md).

[Luke 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 15:2</span></span>

Receiveth sinners - Προσδεχεται. He receives them cordially,
affectionately - takes them to his bosom; for so the word implies. What
mercy! Jesus receives sinners in the most loving, affectionate manner,
and saves them unto eternal life! Reader, give glory to God for ever!

[Luke 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 15:4</span></span>

What man of you - Our Lord spoke this and the following parable to
justify his conduct in receiving and conversing with sinners or
heathens.

A hundred sheep - Parables similar to this are frequent among the Jewish
writers. The whole flock of mankind, both Jews and Gentiles, belongs
unto this Divine Shepherd; and it is but reasonable to expect, that the
gracious proprietor will look after those who have gone astray, and
bring them back to the flock. The lost sheep is an emblem of a heedless,
thoughtless sinner: one who follows the corrupt dictates of his own
heart, without ever reflecting upon his conduct, or considering what
will be the issue of his unholy course of life. No creature strays more
easily than a sheep; none is more heedless; and none so incapable of
finding its way back to the flock, when once gone astray: it will bleat
for the flock, and still run on in an opposite direction to the place
where the flock is: this I have often noticed. No creature is more
defenceless than a sheep, and more exposed to be devoured by dogs and
wild beasts. Even the fowls of the air seek their destruction. I have
known ravens often attempt to destroy lambs by picking out their eyes,
in which, when they have succeeded, as the creature does not see whither
it is going, it soon falls an easy prey to its destroyer. Satan is ever
going about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour; in order to
succeed, he blinds the understanding of sinners, and then finds it an
easy matter to tumble them into the pit of perdition. Who but a Pharisee
or a devil would find fault with the shepherd who endeavors to rescue
his sheep from so much danger and ruin!

[Luke 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 15:7</span></span>

Just persons, which need no repentance - Who do not require such a
change of mind and purpose as these do - who are not so profligate, and
cannot repent of sins they have never committed. Distinctions of this
kind frequently occur in the Jewish writings. There are many persons who
have been brought up in a sober and regular course of life, attending
the ordinances of God, and being true and just in all their dealings;
these most materially differ from the heathens mentioned, [Luk
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#001.md), because they believe in God, and
attend the means of grace: they differ also essentially from the
tax-gatherers mentioned in the same place, because they wrong no man,
and are upright in their dealings. Therefore they cannot repent of the
sins of a heathen, which they have not practised; nor of the rapine of a
tax-gatherer, of which they have never been guilty. As, therefore, these
just persons are put in opposition to the tax-gatherers and heathens, we
may at once see the scope and design of our Lord's words: these needed
no repentance in comparison of the others, as not being guilty of their
crimes. And as these belonged, by outward profession at least, to the
flock of God, and were sincere and upright according to their light,
they are considered as being in no danger of being lost; and at they
fear God, and work righteousness according to their light, he will take
care to make those farther discoveries to them, of the purity of his
nature, the holiness of his law, and the necessity of the atonement,
which he sees to be necessary. See the case of Cornelius, [Act
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#001.md), etc. On this ground, the owner
is represented as feeling more joy in consequence of finding one sheep
that was lost, there having been almost no hope of its recovery, than he
feels at seeing ninety and nine still safe under his care. "Men
generally rejoice more over a small unexpected advantage, than over a
much greater good to which they have been accustomed." There are some,
and their opinion need not be hastily rejected, who imagine that by the
ninety and nine just persons, our Lord means the angels - that they are
in proportion to men, as ninety-nine are to one, and that the Lord takes
more pleasure in the return and salvation of one sinner, than in the
uninterrupted obedience of ninety-nine holy angels; and that it was
through his superior love to fallen man that he took upon him his
nature, and not the nature of angels. I have met with the following weak
objection to this: viz. "The text says just persons; now, angels are not
persons, therefore angels cannot be meant." This is extremely foolish;
there may be the person of an angel, as well as of a man; we allow
persons even in the Godhead; besides, the original word, δικαιοις, means
simply just ones, and may be, with as much propriety, applied to angels
as to men. After all, our Lord may refer to the Essenes, a sect among
the Jews, in the time of our Lord, who were strictly and conscientiously
moral; living at the utmost distance from both the hypocrisy and
pollutions of their countrymen. These, when compared with the great mass
of the Jews, needed no repentance. The reader may take his choice of
these interpretations, or make a better for himself. I have seen other
methods of explaining these words; but they have appeared to me either
too absurd or too improbable to merit particular notice.

[Luke 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 15:8</span></span>

Ten pieces of silver - Δραχμας δεκα, ten drachmas. I think it always
best to retain the names of these ancient coins, and to state their
value in English money. Every reader will naturally wish to know by what
names such and such coins were called in the countries in which they
were current. The Grecian drachma was worth about sevenpence three
farthings of our money; being about the same value as the Roman
denarius.

The drachma that was lost is also a very expressive emblem of a sinner
who is estranged from God, and enslaved to habits of iniquity. The
longer a piece of money is lost, the less probability is there of its
being again found; as it may not only lose its color, and not be easily
observed, but will continue to be more and more covered with dust and
dirt: or its value may be vastly lessened by being so trampled on that a
part of the substance, together with the image and superscription, may
be worn off. So the sinner sinks deeper and deeper into the impurities
of sin, loses even his character among men, and gets the image and
superscription of his Maker defaced from his heart. He who wishes to
find the image of God, which he has lost by sin, must attend to that
word which will be a lantern to his steps, and receive that Spirit which
is a light to the soul, to convince of sin, righteousness, and judgment.
He must sweep the house - put away the evil of his doings; and seek
diligently - use every means of grace, and cry incessantly to God, till
he restore to him the light of his countenance. Though parables of this
kind must not be obliged to go on all fours, as it is termed; yet they
afford many useful hints to preachers of the Gospel, by which they may
edify their hearers. Only let all such take care not to force meanings
on the words of Christ which are contrary to their gravity and majesty.

[Luke 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 15:12</span></span>

Give me the portion of goods - It may seem strange that such a demand
should be made, and that the parent should have acceded to it, when he
knew that it was to minister to his debauches that his profligate son
made the demand here specified. But the matter will appear plain, when
it is considered, that it has been an immemorial custom in the east for
sons to demand and receive their portion of the inheritance during their
father's lifetime; and the parent, however aware of the dissipated
inclinations of the child, could not legally refuse to comply with the
application. It appears indeed that the spirit of this law was to
provide for the child in case of ill treatment by the father: yet the
demand must first be acceded to, before the matter could be legally
inquired into; and then, "if it was found that the father was
irreproachable in his character, and had given no just cause for the son
to separate from him, in that case, the civil magistrate fined the son
in two hundred puns of cowries." See Code of Gentoo laws, pr. disc. p.
56; see also do. chap. 2: sec. 9, p. 81, 82; xxi. sec. 10, p. 301.

[Luke 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 15:13</span></span>

Not many days after - He probably hastened his departure for fear of the
fine which he must have paid, and the reproach to which he must have
been subjected, had the matter come before the civil magistrate. See
above.

Riotous living - Ζων ασωτως, in a course of life that led him to spend
all: from α not, and σωω I save. And this we are informed, [Luk
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#030.md), was among harlots; the readiest
way in the world to exhaust the body, debase the mind, ruin the soul,
and destroy the substance.

[Luke 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 15:14</span></span>

A mighty famine in that land - As he was of a profligate turn of mind
himself, it is likely he sought out a place where riot and excess were
the ruling characteristics of the inhabitants; and, as poverty is the
sure consequence of prodigality, it is no wonder that famine preyed on
the whole country.

[Luke 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 15:15</span></span>

To feed swine - The basest and vilest of all employments; and, to a Jew,
peculiarly degrading. Shame, contempt, and distress are wedded to sin,
and can never be divorced. No character could be meaner in the sight of
a Jew than that of a swineherd: and Herodotus informs us, that in Egypt
they were not permitted to mingle with civil society, nor to appear in
the worship of the gods, nor would the very dregs of the people have any
matrimonial connections with them. Herod. lib. ii. cap. 47.

[Luke 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 15:16</span></span>

With the husks - Κερατιων. Bochart, I think, has proved that κερατια
does not mean husks: to signify which the Greek botanical writers use
the word λοβοι; several examples of which he gives from Theophrastus. He
shows, also, that the original word means the fruit of the ceratonia or
charub tree, which grows plentifully in Syria. This kind of pulse,
Columella observes, was made use of to feed swine. See Bochart, Hieroz.
lib. ii. cap. lvi. col. 707-10.

[Luke 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 15:17</span></span>

When he came to himself - A state of sin is represented in the sacred
writings as a course of folly and madness; and repentance is represented
as a restoration to sound sense. See this fully explained on [Mat
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002) (note.md).

I perish with hunger! - Or, I perish Here. Ὡδε, here, is added by BDL,
Syriac, all the Arabic and Persic, Coptic, Ethiopic, Gothic, Saxon,
Vulgate, all the Itala, and several of the fathers.

[Luke 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 15:18</span></span>

Against heaven - Εις τον ουρανον; that is, against God. The Jews often
make use of this periphrasis in order to avoid mentioning the name of
God, which they have ever treated with the utmost reverence. But some
contend that it should be translated, even unto heaven; a Hebraism for,
I have sinned exceedingly - beyond all description.

[Luke 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 15:20</span></span>

And kissed him - Or, kissed him again and again; the proper import of
καταεφιλησεν αυτον. The father thus showed his great tenderness towards
him, and his great affection for him.

[Luke 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 15:21</span></span>

Make me as one of thy hired servants, is added here by several MSS. and
versions; but it is evident this has been added, merely to make his
conduct agree with his resolution, [Luk
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#019.md). But by this a very great beauty
is lost: for the design of the inspired penman is to show, not merely
the depth of the profligate son's repentance, and the sincerity of his
conversion, but to show the great affection of the father, and his
readiness to forgive his disobedient son. His tenderness of heart cannot
wait till the son has made his confession; his bowels yearn over him,
and he cuts short his tale of contrition and self-reproach, by giving
him the most plenary assurances of his pardoning love.

Bring forth the best robe - Bring out that chief garment, την στολην την
πρωτην, the garment which was laid by, to be used only on birth-days or
festival times. Such as that which Rebecca had laid by for Esau, and
which she put on Jacob when she made him personate his brother. See the
notes on [Gen 27:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#015.md).

Put a ring on his hand - Giving a ring was in ancient times a mark of
honor and dignity. See [Gen 41:42](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#042.md);
[Kg1 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#008.md); [Est
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#002.md); [Dan
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#017.md); [Jam
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#002.md).

Shoes on his feet - Formerly those who were captivated had their shoes
taken off, [Isa 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001.md); and when they
were restored to liberty their shoes were restored. See [Ch2
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#015.md). In Bengal, shoes of a superior
quality make one of the distinguishing parts of a person's dress. Some
of them cost as much as a hundred rupees a pair; 10 or 12. Reference is
perhaps made here to some such costly shoes. It is the same among the
Chinese: some very costly shoes and boots of that people are now before
me.

[Luke 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 15:23</span></span>

The fatted calf, and kill it - Θυσατε, Sacrifice it. In ancient times
the animals provided for public feasts were first sacrificed to God. The
blood of the beast being poured out before God, by way of atonement for
sin, the flesh was considered as consecrated, and the guests were
considered as feeding on Divine food. This custom is observed among the
Asiatics to this day.

[Luke 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 15:24</span></span>

Was dead - Lost to all good - given up to all evil. In this figurative
sense the word is used by the best Greek writers. See many examples in
Kypke.

[Luke 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 15:25</span></span>

His elder son - Meaning probably persons of a regular moral life, who
needed no repentance in comparison of the prodigal already described.

In the field - Attending the concerns of the farm.

He heard music - Συμφωνιας, a number of sounds mingled together, as in a
concert.

Dancing - Χορων. But Le Clerc denies that the word means dancing at all,
as it properly means a choir of singers. The symphony mentioned before
may mean the musical instruments which accompanied the choirs of
singers.

[Luke 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 15:28</span></span>

He was angry - This refers to the indignation of the scribes and
Pharisees, mentioned [Luk 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#001.md), [Luk
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#002.md). In every point of view, the
anger of the older son was improper and unreasonable. He had already
received his part of the inheritance, see [Luk
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#012.md), and his profligate brother had
received no more than what was his just dividend. Besides, what the
father had acquired since that division he had a right to dispose of as
he pleased, even to give it all to one son; nor did the ancient customs
of the Asiatic countries permit the other children to claim any share in
such property thus disposed of. The following is an institute of the
Gentoo law on this subject: (Code, chap. ii. sect. 9, p. 79:) "If a
father gives, by his own choice, land, houses, orchards, and the earning
of his own industry, to one of his sons, the other sons shall not
receive any share of it." Besides, whatever property the father had
acquired after the above division, the son or sons, as the prodigal in
the text, could have no claim at all on, according to another institute
in the above Asiatic laws, see chap. ii. sect. ii. p. 85, but the father
might divide it among those who remained with him: therefore is it said
in the text, "Son, thou art Always with me, and All that I have is
Thine," [Luk 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#031.md).

[Luke 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 15:29</span></span>

Never - a kid - It is evident from [Luk
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#012.md), that the father gave him his
portion when his profligate brother claimed his; for he divided his
whole substance between them. And though he had not claimed it, so as to
separate from, and live independently of, his father, yet he might have
done so whenever he chose; and therefore his complaining was both
undutiful and unjust.

[Luke 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">luk 15:30</span></span>

This thy son - This son of Thine - words expressive of supreme contempt:
This son - he would not condescend to call him by his name, or to
acknowledge him for his brother; and at the same time, bitterly
reproaches his amiable father for his affectionate tenderness, and
readiness to receive his once undutiful, but now penitent, child!

For Him - I have marked those words in small capitals which should be
strongly accented in the pronunciation: this last word shows how
supremely he despised his poor unfortunate brother.

[Luke 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 15:31</span></span>

All that I have is thine - See on [Luk
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#028) (note.md).

[Luke 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">luk 15:32</span></span>

This thy brother - Or, This brother of Thine. To awaken this
ill-natured, angry, inhumane man to a proper sense of his duty, both to
his parent and brother, this amiable father returns him his own unkind
words, but in a widely different spirit. This son of mine to whom I show
mercy is Thy brother, to whom thou shouldst show bowels of tenderness
and affection; especially as he is no longer the person he was: he was
dead in sin - he is quickened by the power of God: he was lost to thee,
to me, to himself, and to our God; but now he is found: and he will be a
comfort to me, a help to thee, and a standing proof, to the honor of the
Most High, that God receiveth sinners. This, as well as the two
preceding parables, was designed to vindicate the conduct of our blessed
Lord in receiving tax-gatherers and heathens; and as the Jews, to whom
it was addressed, could not but approve of the conduct of this
benevolent father, and reprobate that of his elder son, so they could
not but justify the conduct of Christ towards those outcasts of men,
and, at least in the silence of their hearts, pass sentence of
condemnation upon themselves. For the sublime, the beautiful, the
pathetic, and the instructive, the history of Joseph in the Old
Testament, and the parable of the prodigal son in the New, have no
parallels either in sacred or profane history.

The following reflections, taken chiefly from pious Quesnel, cannot fail
making this incomparable parable still more instructive.

Three points may be considered here: I. The degrees of his fall. II. The
degrees of his restoration; and, III. The consequences of his
conversion.

I. The prodigal son is the emblem of a sinner who refuses to depend on
and be governed by the Lord. How dangerous is it for us to desire to be
at our own disposal, to live in a state of independency, and to be our
own governors! God cannot give to wretched man a greater proof of his
wrath than to abandon him to the corruption of his own heart.

Not many days, etc., [Luk 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#013.md). The
misery of a sinner has its degrees; and he soon arrives, step by step,
at the highest pitch of his wretchedness.

The first degree of his misery is, that he loses sight of God, and
removes at a distance from him. There is a boundless distance between
the love of God, and impure self-love; and yet, strange to tell, we pass
in a moment from the one to the other!

The second degree of a sinner's misery is, that the love of God being no
longer retained in the heart, carnal love and impure desires necessarily
enter in, reign there, and corrupt all his actions.

The third degree is, that he squanders away all spiritual riches, and
wastes the substance of his gracious Father in riot and debauch.

When he had spent all, etc., [Luk
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#014.md). The fourth degree of an
apostate sinner's misery is, that having forsaken God, and lost his
grace and love, he can now find nothing but poverty, misery, and want.
How empty is that soul which God does not fill! What a famine is there
in that heart which is no longer nourished by the bread of life!

In this state, he joined himself - εκολληθη, he cemented, closely united
himself, and fervently cleaved to a citizen of that country, [Luk
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#015.md).

The fifth degree of a sinner's misery is, that he renders himself a
slave to the devil, is made partaker of his nature, and incorporated
into the infernal family. The farther a sinner goes from God, the nearer
he comes to eternal ruin.

The sixth degree of his misery is, that he soon finds by experience the
hardship and rigour of his slavery. There is no master so cruel as the
devil; no yoke so heavy as that of sin; and no slavery so mean and vile
as for a man to be the drudge of his own carnal, shameful, and brutish
passions.

The seventh degree of a sinner's misery is, that he has an insatiable
hunger and thirst after happiness; and as this can be had only in God,
and he seeks it in the creature, his misery must be extreme. He desired
to fill his belly with the husks, [Luk
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#016.md). The pleasures of sense and
appetite are the pleasures of swine, and to such creatures is he
resembled who has frequent recourse to them, [Pe2
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#022.md).

II\. Let us observe, in the next place, the several degrees of a
sinner's conversion and salvation.

The first is, he begins to know and feel his misery, the guilt of his
conscience, and the corruption of his heart. He comes to himself,
because the Spirit of God first comes to him, [Luk
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#017.md).

The second is, that he resolves to forsake sin and all the occasions of
it; and firmly purposes in his soul to return immediately to his God. I
will arise, etc., [Luk 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#018.md).

The third is, when, under the influence of the spirit of faith, he is
enabled to look towards God as a compassionate and tender-hearted
father. I will arise and go to my father.

The fourth is, when he makes confession of his sin, and feels himself
utterly unworthy of all God's favors, [Luk
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#019.md).

The fifth is, when he comes in the spirit of obedience, determined
through grace to submit to the authority of God; and to take his word
for the rule of all his actions, and his Spirit for the guide of all his
affections and desires.

The sixth is, his putting his holy resolutions into practice without
delay; using the light and power already mercifully restored to him, and
seeking God in his appointed ways. And he arose and came, etc., [Luk
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#020.md).

The seventh is, God tenderly receives him with the kiss of peace and
love, blots out all his sins, and restores him to, and reinstates him
in, the heavenly family. His father - fell on his neck, and kissed him,
[Luk 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#020.md).

The eighth is, his being clothed with holiness, united to God, married
as it were to Christ Jesus, [Co2 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#002.md),
and having his feet shod with the shoes of the preparation of the Gospel
of peace, [Eph 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#015.md), so that he may
run the ways of God's commandments with alacrity and joy. Bring the best
robe - put a ring - and shoes, etc., [Luk
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#022.md).

III\. The consequences of the sinner's restoration to the favor and
image of God are,

First, the sacrifice of thanksgiving is offered to God in his behalf; he
enters into a covenant with his Maker, and feasts on the fatness of the
house of the Most High.

Secondly, The whole heavenly family are called upon to share in the
general joy; the Church above and the Church below both triumph; for
there is joy (peculiar joy) in the presence of the angels of God over
one sinner that repenteth. See [Luk
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#010.md).

Thirdly, God publicly acknowledges him for his son, not only by enabling
him to abstain from every appearance of evil, but to walk before him in
newness of life, [Luk 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#024.md). The
tender-hearted father repeats these words at [Luk
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#032.md), to show more particularly that
the soul is dead when separated from God; and that it can only be said
to be alive when united to him through the Son of his love. A
Christian's sin is a brother's death; and in proportion to our concern
for this will our joy be at his restoration to spiritual life. Let us
have a brotherly heart towards our brethren, as God has that of a father
towards his children, and seems to be afflicted at their loss, and to
rejoice at their being found again, as if they were necessary to his
happiness.

In this parable, the younger profligate son may represent the Gentile
world; and the elder son, who so long served his father, [Luk
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#020.md), the Jewish people. The anger of
the elder son explains itself at once - it means the indignation
evidenced by the Jews at the Gentiles being received into the favor of
God, and made, with them, fellow heirs of the kingdom of heaven.

It may also be remarked, that those who were since called Jews and
Gentiles, were at first one family, and children of the same father:
that the descendants of Ham and Japhet, from whom the principal part of
the Gentile world was formed, were, in their progenitors, of the
primitive great family, but had afterwards fallen off from the true
religion: and that the parable of the prodigal son may well represent
the conversion of the Gentile world, in order that, in the fullness of
time, both Jews and Gentiles may become one fold, under one Shepherd and
Bishop of all souls.
