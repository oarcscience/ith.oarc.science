### [Jeremiah Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 32:0</span></span>

Jeremiah, now confined for his faithful admonitions, foretells the fate
of the king and city, [Jer 32:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#001.md).
According to the direction of God, he buys of his cousin Hanameel a
field in Anathoth; the contract, or deed of sale, being subscribed,
sealed, and witnessed, and delivered to Baruch, together with a
duplicate not sealed, who is commanded to put them into an earthen
vessel that they may remain there for many days, [Jer
32:6-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#006.md). This transaction of the
prophet, which is entered and subscribed in the public register, God
constitutes a sign or pledge of the Jews' return from the Babylonish
captivity, and of their again possessing houses, fields, and vineyards,
in their own land, and by their own right, according to their tribes and
families, [Jer 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#015.md). Jeremiah's
prayer, in which he recounts God's marvellous acts towards the children
of Israel, and deeply deplores the lamentable state of the country, and
the numerous provocations which have led to it, [Jer
32:16-25](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#016.md). After which God is
introduced declaring his purpose of giving up his people into the hands
of their enemies, [Jer 32:26-35](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#026.md);
promising, however, to restore them in due time to their ancient
possessions, and to make with them an everlasting covenant, [Jer
32:36-44](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#036.md).

[Jeremiah 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 32:1</span></span>

The word that came - This prophecy bears its own date: it was delivered
in the tenth year of Zedekiah, which answered to the eighteenth of
Nebuchadnezzar. It appears from [Kg2
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#008.md), that the eleventh year of
Zedekiah was the nineteenth of Nebuchadnezzar; and consequently, that
the eighteenth of that monarch must have been the tenth of the Jewish
king.

[Jeremiah 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 32:2</span></span>

Then the king of Babylon's army besieged Jerusalem - The siege had
commenced the year before, and continued a year after ending in the
fifth month of the following year; consequently, the siege must have
lasted about eighteen months and twenty-seven days. See [Kg2
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#018.md).

[Jeremiah 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 32:4</span></span>

And shall speak with him mouth to mouth - He shall be reduced to a state
of the most abject servitude. The slave was obliged to fix his eyes on
every motion of the master whilst giving his orders, who often
condescended to give them only by dumb signs.

[Jeremiah 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 32:7</span></span>

The right of redemption is thine - The law had established that the
estates of a family should never be alienated. If, therefore, a man
through poverty was obliged to sell his patrimony, the nearest relative
had a right to purchase it before all others, and even to redeem it, if
it had been sold to another. This is what is called the right of goel,
or kinsman, [Lev 25:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#025.md). And in the
year of jubilee the whole reverted to its ancient master [Lev
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#013.md).

[Jeremiah 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 32:8</span></span>

This was the word of the Lord - It was by his appointment that I was to
make this purchase. The whole was designed as a symbolical act, to show
the people that there would be a return from Babylon, that each family
should re-enter on its former possessions, and that a man might safely
purchase on the certainty of this event.

[Jeremiah 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 32:9</span></span>

Weighed him the money - It does not appear that there was any coined or
stamped money among the Jews before the captivity; the Scripture,
therefore, never speaks of counting money, but of weighing it.

Seventeen shekels of silver - The shekel at this time must have been a
nominal coin; it was a thing of a certain weight, or a certain worth.
Seventeen shekels was the weight of the silver paid: but it might have
been in one ingot, or piece. The shekel has been valued at from two
shillings and threepence to two shillings and sixpence, and even at
three shillings; taking the purchase-money at a medium of the value of
the shekel, it would amount only to about two pounds two shillings and
sixpence. But as estates bore value only in proportion to the number of
years before the jubilee, and the field in question was then in the
hands of the Chaldeans, and this cousin of Jeremiah was not likely to
come back to enjoy it after seventy years, (nor could he then have it,
as a jubilee would intervene and restore it to the original family), and
money must now be very scarce and high in its value, the seventeen
shekels might have been a sufficient sum for a field in those
circumstances, and one probably not large in its dimensions.

[Jeremiah 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 32:10</span></span>

I subscribed the evidence - We have here all the circumstances of this
legal act:

1\. An offer is made of the reversion of the ground, till the jubilee,
to him who would then of right come into possession.

2\. The price is agreed on, and the silver weighed in the balances.

3\. A contract or deed of sale is drawn up, to which both parties
agreeing,

4\. Witnesses are brought forward to see it signed and sealed; for the
contract was both subscribed and sealed.

5\. A duplicate of the deed was drawn, which was not to be sealed, but
to lie open for the inspection of those concerned in some public place
where it might be safe and always to be seen.

6\. The original, which was sealed up, was put in an earthen pitcher in
order to be preserved from accidents.

7\. This was delivered by the purchaser into the hands of a third party,
to be preserved for the use of the purchaser, and witnesses were called
to attest this delivery.

8\. They subscribed the book of the purchase, perhaps a town book, or
register, where such purchases were entered. Baruch was a scribe by
profession; and the deeds were delivered into his hands, before
witnesses, to be preserved as above.

Perhaps the law, in this case, required that the instrument should be
thus lodged. But, in the present case, both the deeds, the original and
the duplicate, were put into the earthen pitcher because the city was
about to be burnt; and if lodged as usual, they would be destroyed in
the general conflagration. See [Jer
32:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#014.md).

[Jeremiah 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 32:15</span></span>

Houses and fields - shall be possessed again - That is, this is an
evidence that the captivity shall not last long: houses, etc., shall
here be possessed again, either by their present owners or immediate
descendants.

The young might return; at least, all under ten years of age: there was
no natural impossibility that they should not live till they should be
fourscore.

[Jeremiah 32:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 32:16</span></span>

I prayed unto the Lord - And what a prayer! What weight of matter,
sublimity of expression, profound veneration, just conception, Divine
unction, powerful pleading, and strength of faith! Historical, without
flatness; condensed, without obscurity; confessing the greatest of
crimes against the most righteous of Beings, without despairing of his
mercy, or presuming on his goodness: a confession that, in fact,
acknowledges that God's justice should smite and destroy, had not his
infinite goodness said, I will pardon and spare.

[Jeremiah 32:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 32:19</span></span>

Thine eyes are open upon all the ways of - men - Thou art omniscient,
and knowest all things; thou art omnipresent, and seest all things.

[Jeremiah 32:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 32:24</span></span>

Behold the mounts - The huge terraces raised up to plant their engines
on, that they might throw darts, stones, etc., into the city.

Because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence - The
city was now reduced to extreme necessity; and from the siege continuing
nearly a year longer, we may conclude that the besieged made a noble
defense.

[Jeremiah 32:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 32:29</span></span>

With the houses, upon whose roofs - As it is most probable that Baal was
the sun, they might have chosen the tops of the houses, which were
always flat, with battlements around, to offer incense and sacrifice to
him at his rising, and while he was in sight above the horizon.

[Jeremiah 32:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 32:30</span></span>

For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil
- They have all been transgressors from their earliest history.

For the children of Israel - The ten tribes.

Have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands - They have
been sinners beyond all others, being excessive idolaters. Their hands
have formed the objects of their worship.

[Jeremiah 32:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jer 32:33</span></span>

Though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them - From the
frequent reference to this, we may naturally conclude that morning
preaching prevailed much in Judea.

[Jeremiah 32:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">jer 32:37</span></span>

Behold, I will gather them out of all countries - A promise often
repeated. See [Jer 29:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#014.md), and the
notes on [Jer 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#008) (note.md), etc.

[Jeremiah 32:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">jer 32:39</span></span>

I will give them one heart - And that a clean one.

And one way - And that a holy and safe one: and to have this clean
heart, and to walk in this good way, will be for the good of them and
their children after them. God's blessing is a profitable inheritance.
They shall have but one object of worship, and one way of salvation; and
being saved from sin, idolatry, and destruction, they must necessarily
be happy within and happy without.

[Jeremiah 32:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">jer 32:41</span></span>

Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good - Nothing can please God
better than our coming to him to receive the good which, with his whole
heart and his whole soul, he is ready to impart. How exceedingly
condescending are these words of God!

[Jeremiah 32:42](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">jer 32:42</span></span>

Will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised - God's word
cannot fail. The Jews have never yet received the good that God has
promised. Nothing like the fulfillment of these promises took place
after their return from Babylon; therefore there remaineth yet a rest
for these ancient people of God; and it is under the Christian
dispensation that they are to have it.

[Jeremiah 32:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">jer 32:44</span></span>

Men shall buy fields for money - This is a reference to the symbolical
purchase mentioned at the beginning of the chapter; that may be
considered by them as a sure sign of their restoration, not only to the
same land, but to their respective inheritances in that land. This the
power of God could alone perform.
