### [Acts Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#001.md)

[Acts](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">act 2:0</span></span>

The day of pentecost being arrived, and the disciples assembled, the
Holy Spirit descended as a mighty rushing wind, and in the likeness of
fiery tongues sat upon them; in consequence of which, they were all
enabled to speak different languages, which they had never learned, [Act
2:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#001.md). An account of persons from
various countries who there present, and were astonished to hear the
apostles declare the wonderful works of God in their respective
languages, [Act 2:5-12](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#005.md). Some cavil,
[Act 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#013.md), and are confounded by
Peter, who asserts that this work is of God; and that thereby a most
important prophecy was fulfilled, [Act
2:14-21](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#014.md). He takes occasion from this
to preach Jesus to them, as the true Lord and only Messiah, [Act
2:22-36](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#022.md). The people are alarmed and
convinced, and inquire what they shall do, [Act
2:37](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#037.md). He exhorts them to repent and be
baptized in the name of Jesus, that they may receive remission of sins
and the gift of the Holy Spirit, [Act
2:38-40](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#038.md). They gladly receive his word,
about three thousand are baptized and added to the Church in one day;
they continue steadfast in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, [Act
2:41](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#041.md), [Act
2:42](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#042.md). The apostles work many miracles;
and the disciples have all things in common, and live in a state of
great happiness and Christian fellowship, [Act
2:43-47](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#043.md).

[Acts 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 2:1</span></span>

When the day of pentecost was fully come - The feast of pentecost was
celebrated fifty days after the passover, and has its name πεντηκοστη
from πεντηκοντα, fifty, which is compounded of πεντε, five, and ηκοντα,
the decimal termination. It commenced on the fiftieth day reckoned from
the first day of unleavened bread, i.e. on the morrow after the paschal
lamb was offered. The law relative to this feast is found in [Lev
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#015.md), [Lev
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#016.md), in these words: And ye shall
count unto you from the morrow after the Sabbath, from the day that ye
brought the sheaf of the wave-offering; seven Sabbaths shall be
complete: even unto the morrow after the seventh Sabbath shall ye number
fifty days. This feast was instituted in commemoration of the giving the
law on Mount Sinai; and is therefore sometimes called by the Jews, שמחת
תורה shimchath torah, the joy of the law, and frequently the feast of
weeks. There is a correspondence between the giving of the law, which is
celebrated by this feast of pentecost, together with the crucifixion of
our Lord, which took place at the passover, and this descent of the Holy
Spirit, which happened at this pentecost.

1\. At the passover, the Israelites were delivered from Egyptian
bondage: this was a type of the thraldom in which the human race were to
Satan and sin.

2\. At the passover Jesus Christ, who was typified by the paschal lamb,
was sacrificed for the sin of the world, and by this sacrifice
redemption from sin and Satan is now procured and proclaimed.

3\. On the pentecost, God gave his law on Mount Sinai, accompanied with
thunderings and lightnings. On the pentecost, God sent down his Holy
Spirit, like a rushing mighty wind; and tongues of fire sat upon each
disciple, in order that, by his influence, that new law of light and
life might be promulgated and established. Thus, the analogy between the
Egyptian bondage and the thraldom occasioned by sin - the deliverance
from Egypt, and the redemption from sin - the giving of the law, with
all its emblematic accompaniments, and the sending down the Holy Spirit,
with its symbols of light, life, and power, has been exactly preserved.

4\. At the Jewish passover, Christ was degraded, humbled, and
ignominiously put to death: at the following festival, the pentecost, he
was highly glorified; and the all conquering and ever during might of
his kingdom then commenced. The Holy Spirit seems to have designed all
these analogies, to show that, through all preceding ages, God had the
dispensation of the Gospel continually in view; and that the old law and
its ordinances were only designed as preparatives for the new.

They were all with one accord in one place - It is probable that the All
here mentioned means the one hundred and twenty spoken of [Act
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#015.md), who were all together at the
election of Matthias. With one accord, ὁμοθυμαδον; this word is very
expressive: it signifies that all their minds, affections, desires, and
wishes, were concentred in one object, every man having the same end in
view; and, having but one desire, they had but one prayer to God, and
every heart uttered it. There was no person uninterested - none
unconcerned - none lukewarm; all were in earnest; and the Spirit of God
came down to meet their united faith and prayer. When any assembly of
God's people meet in the same spirit they may expect every blessing they
need.

In one place. - Where this place was we cannot tell: it was probably in
the temple, as seems to be intimated in [Act
2:46](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#046.md), where it is said they were daily
ὁμοθυμαδον εν τῳ ἱερῳ, with one accord in the temple; and as this was
the third hour of the day, [Act 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#015.md),
which was the Jewish hour of morning prayer, as the ninth hour was the
hour of evening prayer, [Act 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#001.md), it
is most probable that the temple was the place in which they were
assembled.

[Acts 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 2:2</span></span>

A sound from heaven - Probably thunder is meant, which is the harbinger
of the Divine presence.

Rushing mighty wind - The passage of a large portion of electrical fluid
over that place would not only occasion the sound, or thunder, but also
the rushing mighty wind; as the air would rush suddenly and strongly
into the vacuum occasioned by the rarefaction of the atmosphere in that
place, through the sudden passage of the electrical fluid; and the wind
would follow the direction of the fire. There is a good deal of
similarity between this account and that of the appearance of God to
Elijah, [Kg1 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#011.md), [Kg1
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#012.md), where the strong wind, the
earthquake, and the fire, were harbingers of the Almighty's presence,
and prepared the heart of Elijah to hear the small still voice; so, this
sound, and the mighty rushing wind, prepared the apostles to receive the
influences and gifts of the Holy Spirit. In both cases, the sound,
strong wind, and fire, although natural agents, were supernaturally
employed. See the note on [Act 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#007.md).

[Acts 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 2:3</span></span>

Cloven tongues like as of fire - The tongues were the emblem of the
languages they were to speak. The cloven tongues pointed out the
diversity of those languages; and the fire seemed to intimate that the
whole would be a spiritual gift, and be the means of bringing light and
life to the souls who should hear them preach the everlasting Gospel in
those languages.

Sat upon each of them - Scintillations, coruscations, or flashes of
fire, were probably at first frequent through every part of the room
where they were sitting; at last these flashes became defined, and a
lambent flame, in the form of a cloven tongue, became stationary on the
head of each disciple; a proof that the Spirit of God had made each his
temple or residence. That unusual appearances of fire were considered
emblems of the presence and influence of God, both the Scriptures and
the Jewish writings amply prove. Thus God manifested himself to Moses,
when he appointed him to deliver Israel, [Exo
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#002.md), [Exo
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#003.md); and thus he manifested himself
when he delivered the law on Mount Sinai, [Exo
19:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016.md). The Jews, in order to
support the pretensions of their rabbins, as delivering their
instructions by Divine authority and influence, represent them as being
surrounded with fire while they were delivering their lectures; and that
their words, in consequence, penetrated and exhilarated the souls of
their disciples. Some of the Mohammedans represent Divine inspiration in
the same way. In a fine copy of a Persian work, entitled Ajaceb al
Makhlookat, or Wonders of Creation, now before me, where a marred
account of Abraham's sacrifice, mentioned [Gen
15:9-17](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#009.md), is given, instead of the
burning lamp passing between the divided pieces of the victim, [Gen
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#017.md), Abraham is represented standing
between four fowls, the cock, the peacock, the duck, and the crow, with
his head almost wrapped in a flame of lambent fire, as the emblem of the
Divine communication made to him of the future prosperity of his
descendants. The painting in which this is represented is most
exquisitely finished. This notion of the manner in which Divine
intimations were given was not peculiar to the Jews and Arabians; it
exists in all countries; and the glories which appear round the heads of
Chinese, Hindoo, and Christian saints, real or supposed, were simply
intended to signify that they had especial intercourse with God, and
that his Spirit, under the emblem of fire, sat upon them and became
resident in them. There are numerous proofs of this in several Chinese
and Hindoo paintings in my possession; and how frequently this is to be
met with in legends, missals, and in the ancient ecclesiastical books of
the different Christian nations of Europe, every reader acquainted with
ecclesiastical antiquity knows well. See the dedication of Solomon's
temple, [Ch2 7:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#001.md).

The Greek and Roman heathens had similar notions of the manner in which
Divine communications were given: strong wind, loud and repeated peals
of thunder, coruscations of lightning, and lambent flames resting on
those who were objects of the Deities regard, are all employed by them
to point out the mode in which their gods were reported to make their
will known to their votaries. Every thing of this kind was probably
borrowed from the account given by Moses of the appearance on Mount
Sinai; for traditions of this event were carried through almost every
part of the habitable world, partly by the expelled Canaanites, partly
by the Greek sages travelling through Asiatic countries in quest of
philosophic truth: and partly by means of the Greek version of the
Septuagint, made nearly three hundred years before the Christian era.

"A flame of fire seen upon the head of any person was, among the
heathens, considered as an omen from their gods that the person was
under the peculiar care of a supernatural power, and destined to some
extraordinary employment. Many proofs of this occur in the Roman poets
and historians. Wetstein, in his note on this place, has made an
extensive collection of them. I shall quote but one, which almost every
reader of the Aeneid of Virgil will recollect: -

Talia vociferans gemitu tectum omne replebat:

Cum subitum, dictuque oritur mirabile monstrum.

Namque manus inter, maestorumque ora parentum.

Ecce levis summo de vertice visus

Iuli Fundere lumen apex, tactuque innoxia molli

Lambere flamma comas, et circum tempora pasci.

Nos pavidi trepidare metu, crinemque flagrantem

Excutere, et sanctos restinguere fontibus ignes.

At pater Anchises oculos ad sidera laetus

Extulit, et coelo palamas cum voce tetendit:

Jupiter omnipotens -

Da auxilium, pater, atque haec omina firma.

Virg. Aen. ii. v. 679.

While thus she fills the house with clamorous cries,

Our hearing is diverted by our eyes;

For while I held my son, in the short space

Betwixt our kisses and our last embrace,

Strange to relate! from young Iulus' head,

A lambent flame arose, which gently spread

Around his brows, and on his temples fed.

Amazed, with running water, we prepare

To quench the sacred fire, and slake his hair;

But old Anchises, versed in omens, rear'd

His hands to heaven, and this request preferr'd:

If any vows almighty Jove can bend,

Confirm the glad presage which thou art pleased to send.

Dryden.

There is nothing in this poetic fiction which could be borrowed from our
sacred volume; as Virgil died about twenty years before the birth of
Christ.

It may be just necessary to observe, that tongue of fire may be a
Hebraism: for in [Isa 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#024.md), לשון אש
leshon esh, which we render simply fire, is literally a tongue of fire,
as the margin very properly has it. The Hebrews give the name of tongue
to most things which terminate in a blunt point: so a bay is termed in
[Jos 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#002.md), לשן lashon, a tongue. And
in [Jos 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#005.md), what appears to have
been a promontory is called לשון הים leshon hayam, a tongue of the sea.

It sat upon each - That is, one of those tongues, like flames, sat upon
the head of each disciple; and the continuance of the appearance, which
is indicated by the word sat, shows that there could be no illusion in
the case. I still think that in all this case the agent was natural, but
supernaturally employed.

[Acts 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 2:4</span></span>

To speak with other tongues - At the building of Babel the language of
the people was confounded; and, in consequence of this, they became
scattered over the face of the earth: at this foundation of the
Christian Church, the gift of various languages was given to the
apostles, that the scattered nations might be gathered; and united under
one shepherd and superintendent (επισκοπος) of all souls.

As the Spirit gave them utterance - The word αποφθεγγεσθαι seems to
imply such utterance as proceeded from immediate inspiration, and
included oracular communications.

[Acts 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 2:5</span></span>

Devout men, out of every nation - Either by these we are simply to
understand Jews who were born in different countries, and had now come
up to Jerusalem to be present at the passover, and for purposes of
traffic, or proselytes to Judaism, who had come up for the same purpose:
for I cannot suppose that the term ανδρες ευλαβεις, devout men, can be
applied to any other. At this time there was scarcely a commercial
nation under heaven where the Jews had not been scattered for the
purpose of trade, merchandize, etc., and from all these nations, it is
said, there were persons now present at Jerusalem.

[Acts 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 2:6</span></span>

When this was noised abroad - If we suppose that there was a
considerable peal of thunder, which followed the escape of a vast
quantity of electric fluid, and produced the mighty rushing wind already
noticed on [Act 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#002.md), then the whole
city must have been alarmed; and, as various circumstances might direct
their attention to the temple, having flocked thither they were farther
astonished and confounded to hear the disciples of Christ addressing the
mixed multitude in the languages of the different countries from which
these people had come.

Every man heard them speak in his own language - Use may naturally
suppose that, as soon as any person presented himself to one of these
disciples, he, the disciple, was immediately enabled to address him in
his own language, however various this had been from the Jewish or
Galilean dialects. If a Roman presented himself, the disciple was
immediately enabled to address him in Latin - if a Grecian, in Greek -
an Arab, in Arabic, and so of the rest.

[Acts 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 2:7</span></span>

Are not all these - Galileans? - Persons who know no other dialect, save
that of their own country. Persons wholly uneducated, and, consequently,
naturally ignorant of those languages which they now speak so fluently.

[Acts 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 2:8</span></span>

How hear we every man in our own tongue - Some have supposed from this
that the miracle was not so much wrought on the disciples as on their
hearers: imagining that, although the disciples spoke their own tongue,
yet every man so understood what was spoken as if it had been spoken in
the language in which he was born. Though this is by no means so likely
as the opinion which states that the disciples themselves spoke all
these different languages, yet the miracle is the same, howsoever it be
taken; for it must require as much of the miraculous power of God to
enable an Arab to understand a Galilean, as to enable a Galilean to
speak Arabic. But that the gift of tongues was actually given to the
apostles, we have the fullest proof; as we find particular ordinances
laid down by those very apostles for the regulation of the exercise of
this gift; see [Co1 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001.md), etc.

[Acts 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 2:9</span></span>

Parthians - Parthia anciently included the northern part of modern
Persia: it was situated between the Caspian Sea and Persian Gulf, rather
to the eastward of both.

Medes - Media was a country lying in the vicinity of the Caspian Sea;
having Parthia on the east, Assyria on the south, and Mesopotamia on the
west.

Elamites - Probably inhabitants of that country now called Persia: both
the Medes and Elamites were a neighboring people, dwelling beyond the
Tigris.

Mesopotamia - Now Diarbec in Asiatic Turkey; situated between the rivers
Tigris and Euphrates; having Assyria on the east, Arabia Deserta with
Babylonia on the south, Syria on the west, and Armenia on the north. It
was called Padan-aram by the ancient Hebrews, and by the Asiatics is now
called Maverannhar, i.e. the country beyond the river.

Judea - This word has exceedingly puzzled commentators and critics; and
most suspect that it is not the true reading. Bishop Pearce supposes
that Ιουδαιαν is an adjective, agreeing with Μεσοποταμιαν, and
translates the passage thus: the dwellers in Jewish Mesopotamia. He
vindicates this translation by showing that great numbers of the Jews
were settled in this country: Josephus says that the ten tribes remained
in this country till his time; that "there were countless myriads of
them there, and that it was impossible to know their numbers." -
Μυριαδες απειροι, και αριθμῳ γνωσθηναι μη δυναμεναι. See Ant. lib. xv.
c. 2, s. 2, and c. 3, s. 1; Bell. Jud. lib. i. c. 1, 2. This
interpretation, however ingenious, does not comport with the present
Greek text. Some imagine that Ιουδαιαν is not the original reading; and
therefore they have corrected it into Syriam, Syria; Armeniam, Armenia;
Ινδιαν, India; Λυδιαν, Lydia; Ιδουμαιαν, Idumea; Βιθυνιαν, Bithynia; and
Κιλικιαν, Cilicia: all these stand on very slender authority, as may be
seen in Griesbach; and the last is a mere conjecture of Dr. Mangey. If
Judea be still considered the genuine reading, we may account for it
thus: the men who were speaking were known to be Galileans; now the
Galilean dialect was certainly different from that spoken in Judea - the
surprise was occasioned by a Jew being able to comprehend the speech of
a Galilean, without any interpreter and without difficulty; and yet it
is not easy to suppose that there was such a difference between the two
dialects as to render these people wholly unintelligible to each other.

Cappadocia - Was an ancient kingdom of Asia comprehending all that
country that lies between Mount Taurus and the Euxine Sea.

Pontus - Was anciently a very powerful kingdom of Asia, originally a
part of Cappadocia; bounded on the east by Colchis; on the west by the
river Halys; on the north by the Black Sea; and on the south by Armenia
Minor. The famous Mithridates was king of this country; and it was one
of the last which the Romans were able to subjugate.

Asia - Meaning probably Asia Minor; it was that part of Turkey in Asia
now called Natolia.

[Acts 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 2:10</span></span>

Phrygia - A country in Asia Minor, southward of Pontus.

Pamphylia - The ancient name of the country of Natolia, now called
Caramania, between Lycia and Cilicia, near the Mediterranean Sea.

Egypt - A very extensive country of African bounded by the Mediterranean
on the north; by the Red Sea and the Isthmus of Suez, which divide it
from Arabia, on the east; by Abyssinia or Ethiopia on the south; and by
the deserts of Barca and Nubia on the west. It was called Mizraim by the
ancient Hebrews, and now Mesr by the Arabians. It extends 600 miles from
north to south; and from 100 to 250 in breadth, from east to west.

Libya - In a general way, among the Greeks, signified Africa; but the
northern part, in the vicinity of Cyrene, is here meant.

Cyrene - A country in Africa on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea,
southward of the most western point of the Island of Crete.

Strangers of Rome - Persons dwelling at Rome, and speaking the Latin
language, partly consisting of regularly descended Jews and proselytes
to the Jewish religion.

[Acts 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 2:11</span></span>

Cretes - Natives of Crete, a large and noted island in the Levant, or
eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea, now called Candia.

Arabians - Natives of Arabia, a well known country of Asia, having the
Red Sea on the west; the Persian Gulf on the east; Judea on the north;
and the Indian Ocean on the south.

The wonderful works of God - Such as the incarnation of Christ; his
various miracles, preaching, death, resurrection, and ascension; and the
design of God to save the world through him. From this one circumstance
we may learn that all the people enumerated above were either Jews or
proselytes; and that there was probably none that could be, strictly
speaking, called heathens among them. It may at first appear strange
that there could be found Jews in so many different countries, some of
which were very remote from the others; but there is a passage in
Philo's Embassy to Caius which throws considerable light on the subject.
In a letter sent to Caius by King Agrippa, he speaks of to the holy city
of Jerusalem, not merely as the metropolis of Judea, but of many other
regions, because of the colonies at different times led out of Judea,
not only into neighboring countries, such as Egypt, Phoenicia, Syria,
and Coelosyria, but also into those that are remote, such as Pamphylia,
Cilicia, and the chief parts of Asia as far as Bithynia, and the
innermost parts of Pontus; also in the regions of Europe, Thessaly,
Boeotia, Macedonia, Aetolia, Attica, Argos, Corinth, and the principal
parts of Peloponnesus. Not only the continents and provinces (says he)
are full of Jewish colonies, but the most celebrated isles also, Euboea,
Cyprus, and Crete, not to mention the countries beyond the Euphrates.
All these (a small part of Babylon and some other praefectures excepted,
which possess fertile territories) are inhabited by Jews. Not only my
native city entreats thy clemency, but other cities also, situated in
different parts of the world, Asia, Europe, Africa; both islands, sea
coasts, and inland countries." Philonis Opera, edit. Mangey, vol. ii. p.
587.

It is worthy of remark that almost all the places and provinces
mentioned by St. Luke are mentioned also in this letter of King Agrippa.
These, being all Jews or proselytes, could understand in some measure
the wonderful works of God, of which mere heathens could have formed no
conception. It was wisely ordered that the miraculous descent of the
Holy Ghost should take place at this time, when so many from various
nations were present to bear witness to what was done, and to be
themselves subjects of his mighty working. These, on their return to
their respective countries, would naturally proclaim what things they
saw and heard; and by this the way of the apostles was made plain; and
thus Christianity made a rapid progress over all those parts in a very
short time after the resurrection of our Lord.

[Acts 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 2:13</span></span>

These men are full of new wine - Rather sweet wine, for γλευκους, cannot
mean the mustum, or new wine, as there could be none in Judea so early
as pentecost. The Γλευκος, gleucus, seems to have been a peculiar kind
of wine, and is thus described by Hesychius and Suidas: Γλευκος, το
αποσταγμα της σταφυλης, πριν πατηθῃ. Gleucus is that which distils from
the grape before it is pressed. This must be at once both the strongest
and sweetest wine. Calmet observes that the ancients had the secret of
preserving wine sweet through the whole year, and were fond of taking
morning draughts of it: to this Horace appears to refer, Sat. l. ii. s.
iv. ver. 24.

Aufidius forti miscebat mella Falerno.

Mendose: quoniam vacuis committere venis

Nil nisi lene decet: leni praecordia mulso

Prolueris melius.

Aufidius first, most injudicious, quaffed

Strong wine and honey for his morning draught.

With lenient bev'rage fill your empty veins,

For lenient must will better cleanse the reins.

Francis.

[Acts 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 2:14</span></span>

Peter, standing up with the eleven - They probably spoke by turns, not
altogether; but Peter began the discourse.

All ye that dwell at Jerusalem - Οἱ κατοικουντες would be better
translated by the word sojourn, because these were not inhabitants of
Judea, but the strangers mentioned in [Act
2:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#009.md), who had come up to the feast.

[Acts 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 2:15</span></span>

But the third hour of the day - That is, about nine o'clock in the
morning, previously to which the Jews scarcely ever ate or drank, for
that hour was the hour of prayer. This custom appears to have been so
common that even the most intemperate among the Jews were not known to
transgress it; Peter therefore spoke with confidence when he said, these
are not drunken - seeing it is but the third hour of the day, previously
to which even the intemperate did not use wine.

[Acts 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 2:16</span></span>

Spoken by the prophet Joel - The prophecy which he delivered so long ago
is just now fulfilled; and this is another proof that Jesus whom ye have
crucified is the Messiah.

[Acts 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 2:17</span></span>

In the last days - The time of the Messiah; and so the phrase was
understood among the Jews.

I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh - Rabbi Tanchum says, "When
Moses laid his hands upon Joshua, the holy blessed God said, In the time
of the old text, each individual prophet prophesied; but, in the times
of the Messiah, all the Israelites shall be prophets." And this they
build on the prophecy quoted in this place by Peter.

Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy - The word prophesy is not
to be understood here as implying the knowledge and discovery of future
events; but signifies to teach and proclaim the great truths of God,
especially those which concerned redemption by Jesus Christ.

Your young men shall see visions, etc. - These were two of the various
ways in which God revealed himself under the Old Testament. Sometimes he
revealed himself by a symbol, which was a sufficient proof of the Divine
presence: fire was the most ordinary, as it was the most expressive,
symbol. Thus he appeared to Moses on Mount Horeb, and afterwards at
Sinai; to Abraham, Genesis 15:1-21; to Elijah, [Kg1
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#011.md), [Kg1
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#012.md). At other times he revealed
himself by angelic ministry: this was frequent, especially in the days
of the patriarchs, of which we find many instances in the book of
Genesis.

By dreams he discovered his will in numerous instances: see the
remarkable case of Joseph, [Gen 37:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#005.md),
[Gen 37:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#009.md); of Jacob, [Gen
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#001.md), etc.; [Gen
46:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#002.md), etc.; of Pharaoh, [Gen
41:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#001.md); of Nebuchadnezzar, [Dan
4:10-17](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#010.md). For the different ways in
which God communicated the knowledge of his will to mankind, see the
note on [Gen 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#001.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 2:18</span></span>

On my servants and on my handmaidens - This properly means persons of
the lowest condition, such as male and female slaves. As the Jews
asserted that the spirit of prophecy never rested upon a poor man, these
words are quoted to show that, under the Gospel dispensation, neither
bond nor free, male nor female, is excluded from sharing in the gifts
and graces of the Divine Spirit.

[Acts 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 2:19</span></span>

I will show wonders - It is likely that both the prophet and the apostle
refer to the calamities that fell upon the Jews at the destruction of
Jerusalem, and the fearful signs and portents that preceded those
calamities. See the notes on [Mat
24:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#005) (note.md), where these are
distinctly related.

Blood, fire, and vapour of smoke - Skirmishes and assassinations over
the land, and wasting the country with fire and sword.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 2:20</span></span>

The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood - These
are figurative representations of eclipses, intended most probably to
point out the fall of the civil and ecclesiastical state in Judea: see
the notes on [Mat 24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029.md). That the Sun
is darkened when a total eclipse takes place, and that the Moon appears
of a bloody hue in such circumstances, every person knows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 2:21</span></span>

Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved - The
predicted ruin is now impending; and only such as receive the Gospel of
the Son of God shall be saved. And that none but the Christians did
escape, when God poured out these judgments, is well known; and that All
the Christians did escape, not one of them perishing in these
devastations, stands attested by the most respectable authority. See the
note on [Mat 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#013.md).

[Acts 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 2:22</span></span>

A man approved of God - Αποδεδειγμενον, celebrated, famous. The sense of
the verse seems to be this: Jesus of Nazareth, a man sent of God, and
celebrated among you by miracles, wonders, and signs; and all these done
in such profusion as had never been done by the best of your most
accredited prophets. And these signs, etc., were such as demonstrated
his Divine mission.

[Acts 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 2:23</span></span>

Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel - Bp. Pearce paraphrases
the words thus: Him having been given forth; i.e. sent into the world,
and manifested by being made flesh, and dwelling among you, as it is
said in [Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md); see also [Act
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#028.md).

Kypke contends that εκδοτον, delivered, does not refer to God, but to
Judas the traitor "the Jews received Jesus, delivered up to them by
Judas; the immutable counsel of God so permitting."

By the determinate counsel, ὡρισμενῃ βουλῃ; that counsel of God which
defined the time, place, and circumstance, according (προγνωσει) to his
foreknowledge, which always saw what was the most proper time and place
for the manifestation and crucifixion of his Son; so that there was
nothing casual in these things, God having determined that the salvation
of a lost world should be brought about in this way; and neither the
Jews nor Romans had any power here, but what was given to them from
above. It was necessary to show the Jews that it was not through
Christ's weakness or inability to defend himself that he was taken; nor
was it through their malice merely that he was slain; for God had
determined long before, from the foundation of the world, [Rev
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#008.md), to give his Son a sacrifice for
sin; and the treachery of Judas, and the malice of the Jews were only
the incidental means by which the great counsel of God was fulfilled:
the counsel of God intending the sacrifice, but never ordering that it
should be brought about by such wretched means. This was permitted; the
other was decreed. See the observations at the end of this chapter.

By wicked hands have crucified and slain - I think this refers to the
Romans, and not to the Jews; the former being the agents, to execute the
evil purposes of the latter. It is well known that the Jews acknowledged
that they had no power to put our Lord to death, [Joh
18:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#031.md), and it is as well known that
the punishment of the cross was not a Jewish, but a Roman, punishment:
hence we may infer that by δια χειρων ανομων, by the hands of the
wicked, the Romans are meant, being called ανομοι, without law, because
they had no revelation from God; whereas the others had what was
emphatically termed ὁ νομος του Θεου, the law of God, by which they
professed to regulate their worship and their conduct. It was the Jews,
therefore, who caused our Lord to be crucified by the hands of the
heathen Romans.

[Acts 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 2:24</span></span>

Whom God hath raised up - For, as God alone gave him up to death, so God
alone raised him up from death.

Having loosed the pains of death - It is generally supposed that this
expression means, the dissolving of those bonds or obligations by which
those who enter into the region of the dead are detained there till the
day of the resurrection; and this is supposed to be the meaning of חבלי
מות chebley maveth, in [Psa 116:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#003.md), or
חבלי שאול chebley sheol, in [Psa 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#005.md),
and in [Sa2 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#006.md), to which, as a
parallel, this place has been referred. But Kypke has sufficiently
proved that λυειν τας ωδινας θανατου, signifies rather to Remove the
pains or sufferings of death. So Lucian, De Conscr. Hist., says, "a
copious sweat to some, ελυσε τον πυρετον, Removes or carries off the
fever." So Strabo, speaking of the balm of Jericho, says, λυει δε
κεφαλαλγιας θαυμαστως - it wonderfully Removes the headache, etc. That
Christ did suffer the pains and sorrows of death in his passion is
sufficiently evident; but that these were all removed, previously to his
crucifixion, is fully seen in that calm manner in which he met it, with
all its attendant terrors. If we take the words as commonly understood,
they mean that it was impossible for the Prince of Life to be left in
the empire of death: his resurrection, therefore, was a necessary
consequence of his own Divine power.

Instead of θανατου, of death, the Codex Bezae, Syriac, Coptic, and
Vulgate, have Ἁιδου, of hell, or the place of separate spirits; and
perhaps it was on no better authority than this various reading,
supported but by slender evidence, that, He descended into hell, became
an article in what is called the apostles' creed. And on this article
many a popish legend has been builded, to the discredit of sober sense
and true religion.

[Acts 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 2:25</span></span>

For David speaketh concerning him - The quotation here is made from [Psa
16:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#008) (note.md), which contains a most
remarkable prophecy concerning Christ, every word of which applies to
him, and to him exclusively. See the notes there.

[Acts 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 2:26</span></span>

And my tongue was glad - In the Hebrew it is ויגל כבודי vaiyagel kebodi,
"And my glory was glad:" but the evangelist follows the Septuagint, in
reading και ηγαλλιασατο ἡ γλωσσα μου, what all the other Greek
interpreters in the Hexapla translate δοξα μου, my glory. And what is to
be understood by glory here! Why the soul, certainly, and not the
tongue; and so some of the best critics interpret the place.

[Acts 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 2:27</span></span>

Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell - Εις Ἁιδου, in hades, that is, the
state of separate spirits, or the state of the dead. Hades was a general
term among the Greek writers, by which they expressed this state; and
this Hades was Tartarus to the wicked, and Elysium to the good. See the
explanation of the word in the note on [Mat
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#023) (note.md).

To see corruption - Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return, was
a sentence pronounced on man after the fall: therefore this sentence
could be executed on none but those who were fallen; but Jesus, being
conceived without sin, neither partook of human corruption, nor was
involved in the condemnation of fallen human nature; consequently, it
was impossible for his body to see corruption; and it could not have
undergone the temporary death, to which it was not naturally liable, had
it not been for the purpose of making an atonement. It was therefore
impossible that the human nature of our Lord could be subject to
corruption: for though it was possible that the soul and it might be
separated for a time, yet, as it had not sinned, it was not liable to
dissolution; and its immortality was the necessary consequence of its
being pure from transgression.

[Acts 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 2:28</span></span>

Thou hast made known to me the ways of life - That is, the way from the
region of death, or state of the dead and separate spirits; so that I
shall resume the same body, and live the same kind of life, as I had
before I gave up my life for the sin of the world.

[Acts 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 2:29</span></span>

Let me speak freely - of the patriarch David - In Midris Tillin, it is
said, in a paraphrase on the words, my flesh shall rest in hope,
"Neither worm nor insect had power over David." It is possible that this
opinion prevailed in the time of St. Peter, and, if so, his words are
the more pointed and forcible; and therefore thus applied by Dr.
Lightfoot: "That this passage, Thou shalt not leave my soul in hell,
etc., is not to be applied to David himself appears in that I may
confidently aver concerning him, that he was dead and buried, and never
rose again; but his soul was left εις ᾁδου, in the state of the dead,
and He saw corruption; for his sepulchre is with us to this day, under
that very notion, that it is the sepulchre of David, who died and was
there buried; nor is there one syllable mentioned any where of the
resurrection of his body, or the return of his soul εξ ᾁδου from the
state of the dead." To this the same author adds the following
remarkable note: I cannot slip over that passage, Hieros. Chagig. fol.
78: Rab. Jose saith, David died at pentecost, and all Israel bewailed
him, and offered their sacrifices the day following. This is a
remarkable coincidence; and may be easily applied to him of whom David
was a type.

[Acts 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 2:30</span></span>

According to the flesh, he would raise up Christ - This whole clause is
wanting in ACD, one of the Syriac, the Coptic, Ethiopic, Armenian, and
Vulgate; and is variously entered in others. Griesbach rejects it from
the text, and Professor White says of the words, "certissime delenda,"
they should doubtless be expunged. This is a gloss, says Schoettgen,
that has crept into the text, which I prove thus:

1\. The Syriac and Vulgate, the most ancient of the versions, have not
these words.

2\. The passage is consistent enough and intelligible without them.

3\. They are superfluous, as the mind of the apostle concerning the
resurrection of Christ follows immediately in the succeeding verse.

The passage therefore, according to Bp. Pearce, should be read thus:
Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath,
of the fruit of his loins, to set on his throne; and foreseeing that he
(God) would raise up Christ, he spake of the resurrection of Christ,
etc. "In this transition, the words which Peter quotes for David's are
exactly the same with what we read in the psalm above mentioned; and the
circumstance of David's foreseeing that Christ was to be raised up, and
was the person meant, is not represented as a part of the oath; but is
only made to be Peter's assertion, that David, as a prophet, did foresee
it, and meant it."

[Acts 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 2:31</span></span>

That his soul was not left in hell - The words ἡ ψυχη αυτου, his soul,
are omitted by ABCD, Syriac, Coptic, Ethiopic, and Vulgate. Griesbach
has left them out of the text, and Professor White says again,
certissime delenda. The passage may be thus read: "He spake of the
resurrection of Christ, that he was not left in hades, neither did his
flesh see corruption." For the various readings in this and the
preceding verse, see Griesbach.

By the right hand of God exalted - Raised by omnipotence to the highest
dignity in the realms of glory, to sit at the right hand of God, and
administer the laws of both worlds.

The promise of the Holy Ghost - This was the promise that he had made to
them a little before he suffered, as may be seen in [Joh
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#016.md), etc., [Joh
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#007.md), etc., and after he had risen

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 2:35</span></span>

Until I make thy foes thy footstool - It was usual with conquerors to
put their feet on the necks of vanquished leaders, as emblematical of
the state of subjection to which they were reduced, and the total
extinction of their power. By quoting these words, Peter shows the Jews,
who continued enemies to Christ, that their discomfiture and ruin must
necessarily take place, their own king and prophet having predicted this
in connection with the other things which had already been so literally
and circumstantially fulfilled. This conclusion had the desired effect,
when pressed home with the strong application in the following verse.

[Acts 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">act 2:36</span></span>

Both Lord and Christ - Not only the Messiah, but the supreme Governor of
all things and all persons, Jews and Gentiles, angels and men. In the
preceding discourse, Peter assumes a fact which none would attempt to
deny, viz. that Jesus had been lately crucified by them.

He then,

1\. Proves his resurrection.

2\. His ascension.

3\. His exaltation to the right hand of God.

4\. The effusion of the Holy Spirit, which was the fruit of his
glorification, and which had not only been promised by himself, but
foretold by their own prophets: in consequence of which,

5\. It was indisputably proved that this same Jesus, whom they had
crucified, was the promised Messiah; and if so,

6\. The Governor of the universe, from whose power and justice they had
every thing to dread, as they refused to receive his proffered mercy and
kindness.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">act 2:37</span></span>

When they heard this, they were pricked in their heart - This powerful,
intelligent, consecutive, and interesting discourse, supported every
where by prophecies and corresponding facts, left them without reply and
without excuse; and they plainly saw there was no hope for them, but in
the mercy of him whom they had rejected and crucified.

What shall we do? - How shall we escape those judgments which we now see
hanging over our heads?

[Acts 2:38](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">act 2:38</span></span>

Peter said unto them, Repent - Μετανοησατε; Humble yourselves before
God, and deeply deplore the sins you have committed; pray earnestly for
mercy, and deprecate the displeasure of incensed justice. For a
definition of repentance, see on [Mat
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002) (note.md).

And be baptized every one of you - Take on you the public profession of
the religion of Christ, by being baptized in his name; and thus
acknowledge yourselves to be his disciples and servants.

For the remission of sins - Εις αφεσιν ἁμαρτιων, In reference to the
remission or removal of sins: baptism pointing out the purifying
influences of the Holy Spirit; and it is in reference to that
purification that it is administered, and should in consideration never
be separated from it. For baptism itself purifies not the conscience; it
only points out the grace by which this is to be done.

Ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost - If ye faithfully use the
sign, ye shall get the substance. Receive the baptism, in reference to
the removal of sins, and ye shall receive the Holy Ghost, by whose
agency alone the efficacy of the blood of the covenant is applied, and
by whose refining power the heart is purified. It was by being baptized
in the name of Christ that men took upon themselves the profession of
Christianity; and it was in consequence of this that the disciples of
Christ were called Christians.

[Acts 2:39](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">act 2:39</span></span>

For the promise is unto you - Jews of the land of Judea: not only the
fulfillment of the promise which he had lately recited from the prophecy
of Joel was made to them, but in this promise was also included the
purification from sin, with every gift and grace of the Holy Spirit.

To all that are afar off - To the Jews wherever dispersed, and to all
the Gentile nations; for, though St. Peter had not as yet a formal
knowledge of the calling of the Gentiles, yet, the Spirit of God, by
which he spoke, had undoubtedly this in view; and therefore the words
are added, even as many as the Lord our God shall call, i.e. all to
whom, in the course of his providence and grace, he shall send the
preaching of Christ crucified.

[Acts 2:40](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#040.md)

the punishment that awaits it in the destruction of them and their city
by the Romans.

[Acts 2:41](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">act 2:41</span></span>

They that gladly received his word - The word ασμενως, which signifies
joyfully, readily, willingly, implies that they approved of the doctrine
delivered; that they were glad to hear of this way of salvation; and
that they began immediately to act according to its dictates. This last
sense is well expressed in a similar phrase by Josephus: when speaking
of the young Israelites enticing the Midianitish women to sin, by fair
speeches, he says, αἱ δε ασμενως δεξαμεναι τους λογους συνῃεσαν αυτοις,
Ant. l. iv. c. 4. Then they who approved of their words consorted with
them. The word is however omitted by ABCD, Coptic, Sahidic, Ethiopic,
Vulgate, the Itala of the Codex Bezae, Clemens, and Chrysostom.

Were baptized - That is, in the name of Jesus, [Act
2:38](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#038.md), for this was the criterion of a
Jew's conversion; and when a Jew had received baptism in this name he
was excluded from all communication with his countrymen; and no man
would have forfeited such privileges but on the fullest and clearest
conviction. This baptism was a very powerful means to prevent their
apostasy; they had, by receiving baptism in the name of Jesus, renounced
Judaism, and all the political advantages connected with it; and they
found it indispensably necessary to make the best use of that holy
religion which they had received in its stead. Dr. Lightfoot has well
remarked, that the Gentiles who received the Christian doctrine were
baptized in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost;
whereas the Jewish converts, for the reasons already given, were
baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.

Were added - three thousand souls - Προσετεθησαν, They went over from
one party to another. The Greek writers make use of this verb to signify
that act by which cities, towns, or provinces changed their masters, and
put themselves under another government. So these 3000 persons left the
scribes and Pharisees, and put themselves under the teaching of the
apostles, professing the Christian doctrine, and acknowledging that
Christ was come, and that he who was lately crucified by the Jews was
the promised and only Messiah; and in this faith they were baptized.

These 3000 were not converted under one discourse, nor in one place, nor
by one person. All the apostles preached, some in one language, and some
in another; and not in one house - for where was there one at that time
that could hold such a multitude of people? For, out of the multitudes
that heard, 3000 were converted; and if one in five was converted it
must have been a very large proportion. The truth seems to by this: All
the apostles preached in different, parts of the city, during the course
of that day; and in that day, τῃ ἡμερᾳ εκεινῃ, 3000 converts were the
fruits of the conjoint exertions of these holy men. Dr. Lightfoot thinks
that the account in this place is the fulfillment of the prophecy in
[Psa 110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md), etc.: The Lord said unto
my Lord, sit thou on my right hand; this refers to the resurrection and
ascension of Christ. Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy
power, [Psa 110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003.md). This was the day of
his power; and while the apostles proclaimed his death, resurrection,
and ascension, the people came willingly in, and embraced the doctrines
of Christianity.

[Acts 2:42](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">act 2:42</span></span>

They continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine - They received it,
retained it, and acted on its principles.

And fellowship - Κοινωνιᾳ, community; meaning association for religious
and spiritual purposes, The community of goods cannot be meant; for this
is mentioned [Act 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#044.md), [Act
2:45](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#045.md), where it is said, they had all
things common.

And in breaking of bread - Whether this means the holy eucharist, or
their common meals, it is difficult to say. The Syriac understands it of
the former. Breaking of bread was that act which preceded a feast or
meal, and which was performed by the master of the house, when he
pronounced the blessing - what we would call grace before meat. See the
form on [Mat 26:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#026) (note.md).

And in prayers - In supplications to God for an increase of grace and
life in their own souls; for establishment in the truth which they had
received, and for the extension of the kingdom of Christ in the
salvation of men. Behold the employment of the primitive and apostolic
Church.

1\. They were builded up on the foundation of the prophets and apostles,
Jesus Christ himself being the corner stone.

2\. They continued steadfastly in that doctrine which they had so
evidently received from God.

3\. They were separated from the world, and lived in a holy Christian
fellowship, strengthening and building up each other in their most holy
faith.

4\. They were frequent in breaking bread; in remembrance that Jesus
Christ died for them.

5\. They continued in prayers; knowing that they could be no longer
faithful than while they were upheld by their God; and knowing also that
they could not expect his grace to support them, unless they humbly and
earnestly prayed for its continuance.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">act 2:43</span></span>

And fear came upon every soul - Different MSS. and versions read this
clause thus, And Great fear and Trembling came upon every soul in
Jerusalem. For several weeks past they had a series of the most
astonishing miracles wrought before their eyes; they were puzzled and
confounded at the manner in which the apostles preached, who charged
them home with the deliberate murder of Jesus Christ, and who attested,
in the most positive manner, that he was risen from the dead, and that
God had sent down that mighty effusion of the Spirit which they now
witnessed as a proof of his resurrection and ascension, and that this
very person whom they had crucified was appointed by God to be the Judge
of quick and dead. They were in consequences stung with remorse, and
were apprehensive of the judgments of God; and the wonders and signs
continually wrought by the apostles were at once proofs of the celestial
origin of their doctrine and mission, and of their own baseness,
perfidy, and wickedness.

[Acts 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">act 2:44</span></span>

And, all that believed - Οἱ πιστευοντες, The believers, i.e. those who
conscientiously credited the doctrine concerning the incarnation,
crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ, and had, in
consequence, received redemption in his blood.

Were together - Επι το αυτο. "These words signify either, in one time,
[Act 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#001.md); or in one place, [Act
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#001.md); or in one thing. The last of
these three senses seems to be the most proper here; for it is not
probable that the believers, who were then 3000 in number, [Act
2:41](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#041.md), besides the 120 spoken of [Act
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#015.md), were used all to meet at one
time, or in one place, in Jerusalem." See Bp. Pearce.

And had all things common - Perhaps this has not been well understood.
At all the public religious feasts in Jerusalem, there was a sort of
community of goods. No man at such times hired houses or beds in
Jerusalem; all were lent gratis by the owners: Yoma, fol. 12. Megill.
fol. 26. The same may be well supposed of their ovens, cauldrons,
tables, spits, and other utensils. Also, provisions of water were made
for them at the public expense; Shekalim, cap. 9. See Lightfoot here.
Therefore a sort of community of goods was no strange thing at
Jerusalem, at such times as these. It appears, however, that this
community of goods was carried farther; for we are informed, [Act
2:45](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#045.md), that they sold their possessions
and their goods, and parted them to all, as every man had need. But,
this probably means that, as in consequence of this remarkable
outpouring of the Spirit of God; and their conversion, they were
detained longer at Jerusalem than they had originally intended, they
formed a kind of community for the time being, that none might suffer
want on the present occasion; as no doubt the unbelieving Jews, who were
mockers, [Act 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#013.md), would treat these
new converts with the most marked disapprobation. That an absolute
community of goods never obtained in the Church at Jerusalem, unless for
a very short time, is evident from the apostolical precept, [Co1
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#001.md), etc., by which collections were
ordered to be made for the poor; but, if there had been a community of
goods in the Church, there could have been no ground for such
recommendations as these, as there could have been no such distinction
as rich and poor, if every one, on entering the Church, gave up all his
goods to a common stock. Besides, while this sort of community lasted at
Jerusalem, it does not appear to have been imperious upon any; persons
might or might not thus dispose of their goods, as we learn front the
case of Ananias, [Act 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#004.md). Nor does it
appear that what was done at Jerusalem at this time obtained in any
other branch of the Christian Church; and in this, and in the fifth
chap., where it is mentioned, it is neither praised nor blamed. We may
therefore safely infer, it was something that was done at this time, on
this occasion, through some local necessity, which the circumstances of
the infant Church at Jerusalem might render expedient for that place and
on that occasion only.

[Acts 2:46](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">act 2:46</span></span>

They, continuing daily with one accord in the temple - They were present
at all the times of public worship, and joined together in prayers and
praises to God; for it in not to be supposed that they continued to
offer any of the sacrifices prescribed by the law.

Breaking bread from house to house - This may signify, that select
companies, who were contiguous to each other, frequently ate together at
their respective lodgings on their return from public worship. But κατ'
οικον, which we translate from house to house, is repeatedly used by the
Greek writers for home, at home, for though they had all things in
common, each person lived at his own table. Breaking bread is used to
express the act of taking their meals. The bread of the Jews was thin,
hard, and dry, and was never cut with the knife as ours is, but was
simply broken by the hand.

With gladness and singleness of heart - A true picture of genuine
Christian fellowship. They ate their bread: they had no severe fasts;
the Holy Spirit had done in their souls, by his refining influence, what
others vainly expect from bodily austerities. It may be said also, that,
if they had no severe fasts, they had no splendid feasts: all was
moderation, and all was contentment. They were full of gladness,
spiritual joy and happiness; and singleness of heart, every man worthy
of the confidence of his neighbor; and all walking by the same rule, and
minding the same thing.

[Acts 2:47](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">act 2:47</span></span>

Praising God - As the fountain whence they had derived all their
spiritual and temporal blessings; seeing him in all things, and
magnifying the work of his mercy.

Having favor with all the people - Every honest, upright Jew would
naturally esteem these for the simplicity, purity, and charity of their
lives. The scandal of the cross had not yet commenced; for, though they
had put Jesus Christ to death, they had not get entered into a
systematic opposition to the doctrines he taught.

And the Lord added to the Church daily such as should be saved - Though
many approved of the life and manners of these primitive Christians, yet
they did not become members of this holy Church; God permitting none to
be added to it, but τους σωζομενους, those who were saved from their
sins and prejudices. The Church of Christ was made up of saints; sinners
ware not permitted to incorporate themselves with it.

One MS. and the Armenian version, instead of τους σωζομενους, the saved,
have τοις σωζομενοις, to them who were saved; reading the verse thus:
And the Lord added daily to those who were saved. He united those who
were daily converted under the preaching of the apostles to those who
had already been converted. And thus every lost sheep that was found was
brought to the flock, that, under the direction of the great Master
Shepherd, they might go out and in, and find pasture. The words, to the
Church, τῃ εκκλησιᾳ, are omitted by BC, Coptic, Sahidic, Ethiopic,
Armenian, and Vulgate; and several add the words επι το αυτο, at that
tine, (which begin the first verse of the next chapter) to the
conclusion of this. My old MS. English Bible reads the verse thus: For
so the Lord encresed hem that weren maad saaf, eche day, into the same
thing. Nearly the same rendering as that in Wiclif. Our translation of
τους σωζομενους, such as should be saved is improper and insupportable.
The original means simply and solely those who were then saved; those
who were redeemed from their sins and baptized into the faith of Jesus
Christ. The same as those whom St. Paul addressed, [Eph
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#008.md) : By grace ye are saved, εστε
σεσωσμενοι; or, ye are those who have been saved by grace. So in [Tit
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005.md) : According to his mercy he saved
us, εσωσεν ἡμας, by the washing of regeneration. And in [Co1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#018.md), we have the words τοις
σωζομενοις, them who are saved, to express those who had received the
Christian faith; in opposition to τοις απολλυμενοις, to those who are
lost, namely the Jews, who obstinately refused to receive salvation on
the terms of the Gospel, the only way in which they could be saved; for
it was by embracing the Gospel of Christ that they were put in a state
of salvation; and, by the grace it imparted, actually saved from the
power, guilt, and dominion of sin. See [Co1
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#002.md) : I made known unto you,
brethren, the Gospel which I preached unto you, which ye have received,
and in which ye stand; and By Which Ye Are Saved, δι' οὑ και σωζεσθε.
Our translation, which indeed existed long before our present authorized
version, as may be seen in Cardmarden's Bible, 1566, Beck's Bible, 1549,
and Tindall's Testament, printed by Will. Tylle, in 1548, is bad in
itself; but it has been rendered worse by the comments put on it, viz.
that those whom God adds to the Church shall necessarily and unavoidably
be eternally saved; whereas no such thing is hinted by the original
text, be the doctrine of the indefectibility of the saints true or false
- which shall be examined in its proper place.

On that awful subject, the foreknowledge of God, something has already
been spoken: see [Act 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#023.md). Though it
is a subject which no finite nature can comprehend, yet it is possible
so to understand what relates to us in it as to avoid those rocks of
presumption and despondency on which multitudes have been shipwrecked.
The foreknowledge of God is never spoken of in reference to himself, but
in reference to us: in him properly there is neither foreknowledge nor
afterknowledge. Omniscience, or the power to know all things, is an
attribute of God, and exists in him as omnipotence, or the power to do
all things. He can do whatsoever he will; and he does whatsoever is fit
or proper to be done. God cannot have foreknowledge, strictly speaking,
because this would suppose that there was something coming, in what we
call futurity, which had not yet arrived at the presence of the Deity.
Neither can he have any afterknowledge, strictly speaking, for this
would suppose that something that had taken place, in what we call
pretereity, or past time, had now got beyond the presence of the Deity.
As God exists in all that can be called eternity, so he is equally every
where: nothing can be future to him, because he lives in all futurity;
nothing can be past to him, because he equally exists in all past time;
futurity and pretereity are relative terms to us; but they can have no
relation to that God who dwells in every point of eternity; with whom
all that is past, and all that is present, and all that is future to
man, exists in one infinite, indivisible, and eternal Now. As God's
omnipotence implies his power to do all things, so God's omniscience
implies his power to know all things; but we must take heed that we
meddle not with the infinite free agency of this Eternal Being. Though
God can do all thinks, he does not all things. Infinite judgment directs
the operations of his power, so that though he can, yet he does not do
all things, but only such things as are proper to be done. In what is
called illimitable space, he can make millions of millions of systems;
but he does not see proper to do this. He can destroy the solar system,
but he does not do it: he can fashion and order, in endless variety, all
the different beings which now exist, whether material, animal, or
intellectual; but he does not do this, because he does not see it proper
to be done. Therefore it does not follow that, because God can do all
things, therefore he must do all things. God is omniscient, and can know
all things; but does it follow from this that he must know all things?
Is he not as free in the volitions of his wisdom, as he is in the
volitions of his power? The contingent as absolute, or the absolute as
contingent? God has ordained some things as absolutely certain; these he
knows as absolutely certain. He has ordained other things as contingent;
these he knows as contingent. It would be absurd to say that he
foreknows a thing as only contingent which he has made absolutely
certain. And it would be as absurd to say that he foreknows a thing to
be absolutely certain which in his own eternal counsel he has made
contingent. By absolutely certain, I mean a thing which must be, in that
order, time, place, and form in which Divine wisdom has ordained it to
be; and that it can be no otherwise than this infinite counsel has
ordained. By contingent, I mean such things as the infinite wisdom of
God has thought proper to poise on the possibility of being or not
being, leaving it to the will of intelligent beings to turn the scale.
Or, contingencies are such possibilities, amid the succession of events,
as the infinite wisdom of God has left to the will of intelligent beings
to determine whether any such event shall take place or not. To deny
this would involve the most palpable contradictions, and the most
monstrous absurdities. If there be no such things as contingencies in
the world, then every thing is fixed and determined by an unalterable
decree and purpose of God; and not only all free agency is destroyed,
but all agency of every kind, except that of the Creator himself; for on
this ground God is the only operator, either in time or eternity: all
created beings are only instruments, and do nothing but as impelled and
acted upon by this almighty and sole Agent. Consequently, every act is
his own; for if he have purposed them all as absolutely certain, having
nothing contingent in them, then he has ordained them to be so; and if
no contingency, then no free agency, and God alone is the sole actor.
Hence the blasphemous, though, from the premises, fair conclusion, that
God is the author of all the evil and sin that are in the world; and
hence follows that absurdity, that, as God can do nothing that is wrong,
Whatever Is, is Right. Sin is no more sin; a vicious human action is no
crime, if God have decreed it, and by his foreknowledge and will
impelled the creature to act it. On this ground there can be no
punishment for delinquencies; for if every thing be done as God has
predetermined, and his determinations must necessarily be all right,
then neither the instrument nor the agent has done wrong. Thus all vice
and virtue, praise and blame, merit and demerit, guilt and innocence,
are at once confounded, and all distinctions of this kind confounded
with them. Now, allowing the doctrine of the contingency of human
actions, (and it must be allowed in order to shun the above absurdities
and blasphemies), then we see every intelligent creature accountable for
its own works, and for the use it makes of the power with which God has
endued it; and, to grant all this consistently, we must also grant that
God foresees nothing as absolutely and inevitably certain which he has
made contingent; and, because he has designed it to be contingent,
therefore he cannot know it as absolutely and inevitably certain. I
conclude that God, although omniscient, is not obliged, in consequence
of this, to know all that he can know; no more than he is obliged,
because he is omnipotent, to do all that he can do.

How many, by confounding the self and free agency of God with a sort of
continual impulsive necessity, have raised that necessity into an
all-commanding and overruling energy, to which God himself is made
subject! Very properly did Milton set his damned spirits about such work
as this, and has made it a part of their endless punishment: -

Others apart sat on a hill retired,

In thoughts more elevate; and reasoned high

Of providence, foreknowledge, will, and fate;

Fixed fate, free-will, foreknowledge absolute,

And found no end, in wand'ring mazes lost.

Parad. Lost, b. ii. l. 557.

Among some exceptionable expressions, the following are also good
thoughts on the flee agency and fall of man: -

\- I made him just and right,

Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall.

Not free, what proof could they have given sincere

Of true allegiance, constant faith or love,

When only what they needs must do appeared,

Not what they would? What praise could they receive?.

Useless and vain, of freedom both despoiled,

Made passive, both had served Necessity,

Not Me. -

So without least impulse or shadow of fate,

Or aught by me immutably foreseen,

They trespass, authors to themselves in all

Both what they judge, and what they choose, for so

I formed them free, and free they must remain

Till they enthrall themselves: I else must change

Their nature, and revoke the high decree

Unchangeable, eternal, which ordained

Their freedom; they themselves ordained their fall.

Ibid, b. iii. l. 98, 103, 120.

I shall conclude these observations with a short extract from Mr. Bird's
Conferences, where, in answer to the objection, "If many things fall out
contingently, or as it were by accident, God's foreknowledge of them can
be but contingent, dependent on man's free will," he observes: "It is
one thing to know that a thing will be done necessarily; and another, to
know necessarily that a thing will be done. God doth necessarily
foreknow all that will be done; but he doth not know that those things
which shall be done voluntarily will be done necessarily: he knoweth
that they will be done; but he knoweth withal that they might have
fallen out otherwise, for aught he had ordered to the contrary. So
likewise God knew that Adam would fall; and get he knew that he would
not fall necessarily, for it was possible for him not to have fallen.
And as touching God's preordination going before his prescience as the
cause of all events this would be to make God the author of all the sin
in the world; his knowledge comprehending that as well as other things.
God indeed foreknoweth all things, because they will be done; but things
are not (therefore) done, because he foreknoweth them. It is impossible
that any man, by his voluntary manner of working, should elude God's
foresight; but then this foresight doth not necessitate the will, for
this were to take it wholly away. For as the knowledge of things present
imports no necessity on that which is done, so the foreknowledge of
things future lays no necessity on that which shall be; because
whosoever knows and sees things, he knows and sees them as they are, and
not as they are not; so that God's knowledge doth not confound things,
but reaches to all events, not only which come to pass, but as they come
to pass, whether contingency or necessarily. As, for example, when you
see a man walking upon the earth, and at the very same instant the sun
shining in the heavens, do you not see the first as voluntary, and the
second as natural? And though at the instant you see both done, there is
a necessity that they be done, (or else you could not see them at all),
yet there was a necessity of one only before they were done, (namely,
the sun's shining in the heavens), but none at all of the other, (viz.
the man's walking upon the earth.) The sun could not but shine, as being
a natural agent; the man might not have walked, as being a voluntary
one." This is a good argument; but I prefer that which states the
knowledge of God to be absolutely free, without the contradictions which
are mentioned above. "But you deny the omniscience of God." - No, no
more than I deny his omnipotence, and you know I do not, though you have
asserted the contrary. But take heed how you speak about this infinitely
free agent: if you will contradict, take heed that you do not blaspheme.
I ask some simple questions on the subject of God's knowledge and power:
if you know these things better than your neighbor, be thankful, be
humble, and pray to God to give you amiable tempers; for the wrath of
man worketh not the righteousness of God. May he be merciful to thee and
me!
