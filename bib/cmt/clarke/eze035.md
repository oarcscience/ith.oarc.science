### [Ezekiel Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#001)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 35:0</span></span>

The prophet having formerly predicted the ruin of Edom, the same with
Seir, ([Eze 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#012)), now resumes and
pursues the subject at greater length, intimating, as did also Isaiah,
([Isa 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#011), [Isa
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#012)), that though other nations
should recover their liberty after the fall of the Babylonian monarchy,
the Edomites should continue in bondage for their very despiteful
behavior towards the children of Israel in the day of their calamity,
[Eze 35:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#001).

[Ezekiel 35:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 35:2</span></span>

Set thy face against Mount Seir - That is, against the Edomites. This
prophecy was probably delivered about the time of the preceding, and
before the destruction of Idumea by Nebuchadnezzar, which took place
about five years after.

Calmet supposes that two destructions of Idumea are here foretold; one
by Nebuchadnezzar, and the other by the Jews after their return from
their captivity.

[Ezekiel 35:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 35:3</span></span>

Most desolate - Literally, "A desolation and a wilderness."

[Ezekiel 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 35:5</span></span>

A perpetual hatred - The Edomites were the descendants of Esau; the
Israelites, the descendants of Jacob. Both these were brothers; and
between them there was contention even in the womb, and they lived
generally in a state of enmity. Their descendants kept up the ancient
feud: but the Edomites were implacable; they had not only a rooted but
perpetual enmity to the Israelites, harassing and distressing them by
all possible means; and they seized the opportunity, when the Israelites
were most harassed by other enemies, to make inroads upon them, and cut
them off wherever they found them.

To afflict the afflicted is cruel. This is scarcely of man, bad as he
is. He must be possessed by the malignant spirit of the devil, when he
wounds the wounded, insults over the miseries of the afflicted, and
seeks opportunities to add affliction to those who are already under the
rod of God.

[Ezekiel 35:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 35:6</span></span>

Blood shall pursue thee - Thou lovest blood, and thou shalt have blood.
It is said that Cyrus and two hundred thousand men were slain in an
ambush by Thomyris, queen of the Scythians, and that she cut ok his
head, and threw it into a vessel filled with blood, with this severe
sarcasm: -

Satia te sanguine quem sitisti, Cyre.

"O Cyrus, now satisfy thyself with blood."

Hence, the figure: -

"Sarcasmus, with this biting taunt doth kill:

Cyrus, thy thirst was blood, now drink thy fill."

[Ezekiel 35:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 35:9</span></span>

Perpetual desolations - Thou shalt have perpetual desolation for thy
perpetual hatred.

[Ezekiel 35:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 35:10</span></span>

These two nations - Israel and Judah. The Idumeans thought of conquering
and possessing both; and they would have succeeded, but only the Lord
was there; and this spoiled their projects, and blasted their hopes.

[Ezekiel 35:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 35:12</span></span>

They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume - They exulted in
seeing Judea overrun; and they rejoiced in the prospect of completing
the ruin, when the Chaldeans had withdrawn from the land.

[Ezekiel 35:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 35:13</span></span>

Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me - Ye have said you would
enter into those lands, and take them for your inheritance; though ye
knew that God had promised them to the Israelites, and that you should
never have them for your portion.

[Ezekiel 35:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 35:14</span></span>

When the whole earth rejoiceth - When the whole land shall rejoice in
the restoration of the Jews, I will make thee desolate. Probably this
refers to the time of the Maccabees.

[Ezekiel 35:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 35:15</span></span>

So will I do unto thee - Others shall rejoice in thy downfall as thou
hast rejoiced at their downfall.

This whole chapter strongly inculcates this maxim: Do as thou wouldst be
done by; and what thou wouldst not have done to thee, do not to others.
And from it we learn that every man may, in some sort, be said to make
his own temporal good or evil; for as he does to others, God will take
care to do to him, whether it be evil or good, weal or wo. Would you not
be slandered or backbitten? Then do not slander nor backbite. Wouldst
thou wish to live in peace? Then do not disturb the peace of others. Be
merciful, and thou shalt obtain mercy.
