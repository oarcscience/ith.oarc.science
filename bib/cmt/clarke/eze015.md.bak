### [Ezekiel Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 15:0</span></span>

The Jewish nation, about to be destroyed by the Chaldeans, compared to a
barren vine which is fit for nothing but to be cast into the fire, [Eze
15:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#001.md).

[Ezekiel 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 15:2</span></span>

What is the vine tree more than any tree - It is certain that the vine
is esteemed only on account of its fruit. In some countries, it is true,
it grows to a considerable size and thickness: but, even then, it is not
of a sufficient density to work into furniture. But whatever may be said
of the stock of the vine, it is the branch that the prophet speaks of
here; and I scarcely know the branch of any tree in the forest more
useless than is the branch of the vine. Out of it who can even make a
pin to drive into a mud wall, or hang any vessel on? A vine would never
be cultivated for the sake of its wood; it is really worthless but as it
bears fruit. What is Israel? Good for nothing, but as God influenced
them to bring forth fruit to his glory. But now that they have ceased to
be fruitful, they are good for nothing, but, like a withered branch of
the vine, to be burnt.

[Ezekiel 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 15:4</span></span>

The fire devoureth both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned -
Judea is like a vine branch thrown into the fire, which seizes on both
the ends, and scorches the middle: so both the extremities of the land
is wasted; and the middle, Jerusalem, is now threatened with a siege,
and by and by will be totally destroyed.

[Ezekiel 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 15:6</span></span>

Therefore thus saith the Lord - As surely as I have allotted such a vine
branch, or vine branches, for fuel; so surely have I appointed the
inhabitants of Jerusalem to be consumed.

The design of this parable is to abate the pride of the Jews; to show
them that, in their best estate, they had nothing but what they had
received, and therefore deserved nothing; and now, having fallen from
all righteousness, they can have no expectation of any thing but
judgment unmixed with mercy.

[Ezekiel 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 15:7</span></span>

They shall go out from one fire, and another fire shall devour them - If
they escape the sword, they shall perish by the famine; if they escape
the famine, they shall be led away captives. To escape will be
impossible. It will be to them according to the proverb: -

Incidit in Scyllam, cupiens vitare Charybdim.

"Out of the scald, into the flame."

[Ezekiel 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 15:8</span></span>

They have committed a trespass - They have prevaricated; they are the
worst of sinners, and shall have the heaviest of punishments. Can men
suppose that it is possible to hide even their dark hearts from God?
