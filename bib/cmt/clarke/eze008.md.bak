### [Ezekiel Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 8:0</span></span>

Here begins a section of prophecy extending to the twelfth chapter. In
this chapter the prophet is carried in vision to Jerusalem, [Eze
8:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#001.md); and there shown the idolatries
committed by the rulers of the Jews, even within the temple. In the
beginning of this vision, by the noblest stretch of an inspired
imagination, idolatry itself is personified, and made an idol; and the
image sublimely called, from the provocation it gave God, the Image of
Jealousy, [Eze 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#005.md). The prophet then
proceeds to describe the three principal superstitions of this unhappy
people: the Egyptian, [Eze 8:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#006.md), the
Phoenician, [Eze 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#013.md), [Eze
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#014.md), and the Persian, [Eze
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#015.md), [Eze
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#016.md); giving the striking features of
each, and concluding with a declaration of the heinousness of their sins
in the sight of God, and the consequent greatness of their punishment,
[Eze 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#017.md), [Eze
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#018.md).

[Ezekiel 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 8:1</span></span>

In the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month -
This, according to Abp. Usher, was the sixth year of Ezekiel's
captivity. The sixth day of the fifth month of the ecclesiastical year,
which answers to August A.M. 3410.

This chapter and the three following contain but one vision, of which I
judge it necessary, with Calmet, to give a general idea, that the
attention of the reader may not be too much divided.

The prophet, in the visions of God, is carried to Jerusalem, to the
northern gate of the temple, which leads by the north side to the court
of the priests. There he sees the glory of the Lord in the same manner
as he did by the river Chebar. At one side he sees the image of
jealousy. Going thence to the court of the people, he sees through an
opening in the wall seventy elders of the people, who were worshipping
all sorts of beasts and reptiles, which were painted on the wall. Being
brought thence to the gate of the door of the house, he saw women
weeping for Tammuz or Adonis. As he returned to the court of the
priests, between the porch and the altar, he saw twenty-five men with
their backs to the sanctuary and their faces towards the east,
worshipping the rising sun. This is the substance of the vision
contained in the eighth chapter.

About the same time he saw six men come from the higher gate with swords
in their hands; and among them, one with an ink-horn. Then the Divine
Presence left the cherubim, and took post at the entrance of the temple,
and gave orders to the man with the ink-horn to put a mark on the
foreheads of those who sighed and prayed because of the abominations of
the land; and then commanded the men with the swords to go forward, and
slay every person who had not this mark. The prophet, being left alone
among the dead, fell on his face, and made intercession for the people.
The Lord gives him the reason of his conduct; and the man with the
ink-horn returns, and reports to the Lord what was done. These are the
general contents of the ninth chapter.

The Lord commands the same person to go in between the wheels of the
cherubim, and take his hand full of live coals, and scatter them over
the city. He went as commanded, and one of the cherubim gave him the
coals; at the same time the glory of the Lord, that had removed to the
threshold of the house, now returned, and stood over the cherubim. The
cherubim, wheels, wings, etc., are here described as in the first
chapter. This is the substance of the tenth chapter.

The prophet then finds himself transported to the east gate of the
temple, where he saw twenty-five men, and among them Jaazaniah the son
of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people, against
whom the Lord commands him to prophesy, and to threaten them with the
utmost calamities, because of their crimes. Afterwards God himself
speaks, and shows that the Jews who should be left in the land should be
driven out because of their iniquities, and that those who had been led
captive, and who acknowledged their sins and repented of them, should be
restored to their own land. Then the glory of the Lord arose out of the
city, and rested for a time on one of the mountains on the east of
Jerusalem, and the prophet being carried in vision by the Spirit to
Chaldea, lost sight of the chariot of the Divine glory, and began to
show to the captivity what the Lord had shown to him. This is the
substance of the eleventh chapter.

We may see from all this what induced the Lord to abandon his people,
his city, and his temple; the abominations of the people in public and
in private. But because those carried away captives with Jeconiah
acknowledged their sins, and their hearts turned to the Lord, God
informs them that they shall be brought back and restored to a happy
state both in temporal and spiritual matters, while the others, who had
filled up the measure of their iniquities, should be speedily brought
into a state of desolation and ruin. This is the sum and intent of the
vision in these four chapters.

[Ezekiel 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 8:2</span></span>

The appearance of fire - See the note on [Eze
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#027.md).

[Ezekiel 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 8:3</span></span>

The image of jealousy - סמל הקנאה semel hakkinah. We do not know
certainly of what form this image was, nor what god it represented. Some
say it was the image of Baal, which was placed in the temple by
Manasses; others, that it was the image of Mars; and others, that it was
the image of Tammuz or Adonis. Calmet supports this opinion by the
following reasons: -

1\. The name agrees perfectly with him. He was represented as a
beautiful youth, beloved by Venus; at which Mars, her paramour, being
incensed and filled with jealousy, sent a large boar against Adonis,
which killed him with his tusks. Hence it was the image of him who fell
a victim to jealousy.

2\. The prophet being returned towards the northern gate, where he had
seen the image of jealousy, [Eze 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#014.md),
there saw the women lamenting for Tammuz. Now Tammuz, all agree,
signifies Adonis; it was that therefore which was called the image of
jealousy.

3\. The Scripture often gives to the heathen idols names of degradation;
as Baal-zebub, god of flies; Baal-zebul; god of dung.

It is likely that it was Adonis who is called The dead, [Lev
19:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#027.md), [Lev
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#028.md); [Deu
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#009.md), because he was worshipped as one
dead. And the women represented as worshipping him were probably
adulteresses, and had suffered through the jealousy of their husbands.
And this worship of the image of jealousy provoked God to jealousy, to
destroy this bad people.

[Ezekiel 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 8:4</span></span>

The vision that I saw in the plain - see the note on [Eze
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#023) (note.md); see also [Eze
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#003) (note.md).

[Ezekiel 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 8:7</span></span>

A hole in the wall - This we find was not large enough to see what was
doing within; and the prophet is directed to dig, and make it larger,
[Eze 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#008.md); and when he had done so and
entered, he says: -

[Ezekiel 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 8:10</span></span>

And saw - every form of creeping things - It is very likely that these
images pourtrayed on the wall were the objects of Egyptian adoration:
the ox, the ape, the dog, the crocodile, the ibis, the scarabaeus or
beetle, and various other things. It appears that these were privately
worshipped by the sanhedrin or great Jewish council, consisting of
seventy or seventy-two persons, six chosen out of every tribe, as
representatives of the people. The images were pourtrayed upon the wall,
as we find those ancient idols are on the walls of the tombs of the
kings and nobles of Egypt. See the plates to Belzoni's Travels, the
Isaic Tomb in the Bodleian Library, and the Egyptian hieroglyphics in
general. Virgil speaks of these, Aen. lib. viii.: -

Omnigenumque Deum monstra, et latrator Anubis.

"All kinds of gods, monsters, and barking dogs."

[Ezekiel 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 8:11</span></span>

Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan - Shaphan was a scribe, or what some call
comptroller of the temple, in the days of Josiah; and Jaazaniah his son
probably succeeded him in this office. He was at the head of this band
of idolaters.

[Ezekiel 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 8:14</span></span>

There sat women weeping for Tammuz - This was Adonis, as we have already
seen; and so the Vulgate here translates. My old MS. Bible reads, There
saten women, mornynge a mawmete of lecherye that is cleped Adonrdes. He
is fabled to have been a beautiful youth beloved by Venus, and killed by
a wild boar in Mount Lebanon, whence springs the river Adonis, which was
fabled to run blood at his festival in August. The women of Phoenicia,
Assyria, and Judea worshipped him as dead, with deep lamentation,
wearing priapi and other obscene images all the while, and they
prostituted themselves in honor of this idol. Having for some time
mourned him as dead, they then supposed him revivified and broke out
into the most extravagant rejoicings. Of the appearance of the river at
this season, Mr. Maundrell thus speaks: "We had the good fortune to see
what is the foundation of the opinion which Lucian relates, viz., that
this stream at certain seasons of the year, especially about the feast
of Adonis, is of a bloody color, proceeding from a kind of sympathy, as
the heathens imagined, for the death of Adonis, who was killed by a wild
boar in the mountain out of which this stream issues. Something like
this we saw actually come to pass, for the water was stained to a
surprising redness; and, as we observed in travelling, had stained the
sea a great way into a reddish hue." This was no doubt occasioned by a
red ochre, over which the river ran with violence at this time of its
increase. Milton works all this up in these fine lines: -

"Thammuz came next behind,

Whose annual wound in Lebanon allured

The Syrian damsels to lament his fate,

In amorous ditties all a summer's day;

While smooth Adonis, from his native rock,

Ran purple to the sea, suffused with blood

Of Thammuz, yearly wounded. The love tale

Infected Sion's daughters with like heat:

Whose wanton passions in the sacred porch

Ezekiel saw, when by the vision led,

His eye surveyed the dark idolatries

Of alienated Judah."

Par. Lost, b. 1:446.

Tammuz signifies hidden or obscure, and hence the worship of his image
was in some secret place.

[Ezekiel 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 8:16</span></span>

Five and twenty men - These most probably represented the twenty-four
courses of the priests, with the high priest for the twenty-fifth. This
was the Persian worship, as their turning their faces to the east
plainly shows they were worshipping the rising sun.

[Ezekiel 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 8:17</span></span>

They put the branch to their nose - This is supposed to mean some branch
or branches, which they carried in succession in honor of the idol, and
with which they covered their faces, or from which they inhaled a
pleasant smell, the branches being odoriferous. That the heathens
carried branches of trees in their sacred ceremonies is well known to
all persons acquainted with classic antiquity; and it is probable that
the heathen borrowed those from the use of such branches in the Jewish
feast of tabernacles. There are many strange, and some filthy,
interpretations given of this clause; but the former are not worth
repeating, and I abominate the latter too much to submit to defile my
paper with them. Probably the Brahminic Linga is here intended.

It really seems that at this time the Jews had incorporated every
species of idolatry in their impure worship, - Phoenician, Egyptian, and
Persian. I might add that some imagine the image of jealousy to be a
personification of idolatry itself.
