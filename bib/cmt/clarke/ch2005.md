### [2 Chronicles Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 5:0</span></span>

Solomon having finished the temple, brings in the things which his
father had consecrated, [Ch2 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#001.md). He
assembles the elders and chiefs of Israel and the Levites, in order to
bring up the ark from the city of David, [Ch2
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#002.md), [Ch2
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#003.md). They bring it and its vessels;
and having offered innumerable sacrifices, place it in the temple, under
the wings of the cherubim, [Ch2
5:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#004.md). The Levites, singers, and
trumpeters praise God; and his glory descends and fills the house, so
that the priests cannot stand to minister, [Ch2
5:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#011.md).

[2 Chronicles 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 5:1</span></span>

Brought in all the things - See the note on [Kg1
7:51](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#051.md).

[2 Chronicles 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 5:3</span></span>

The feast - "That is, the feast of tabernacles, which was held in the
seventh month." - Targum. See [Kg1
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#002.md).

[2 Chronicles 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 5:9</span></span>

They drew out the staves - As the ark was no longer to be carried about,
these were unnecessary.

[2 Chronicles 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 5:10</span></span>

There was nothing in the ark save - The Chaldee paraphrases thus: "There
was nothing put in the ark but the two tables which Moses placed there,
after the first had been broken on account of the calf which they made
in Horeb, and the two other tables had been confirmed which were written
with writing expressed in the Ten Words."

[2 Chronicles 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 5:11</span></span>

When the priests were come out - After having carried the ark into the
holy of holies, before the sacred service had commenced.

[2 Chronicles 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 5:12</span></span>

A hundred and twenty priests - Cymbals, psalteries, and harps, of any
kind, in union with a hundred and twenty trumpets or horns, could not
produce much harmony; as to melody, that must have been impossible, as
the noise was too great.

[2 Chronicles 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 5:13</span></span>

For he is good - This was either the whole of the song, or the burden of
each verse. The Hebrew is very short: -

כי טוב כי לעולם חסדו

Ki tob ki leolam chasdo.

For he is good; for his mercy is endless.

[2 Chronicles 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 5:14</span></span>

The priests could not stand - What a proof of the being of God, and of
the Divine presence! What must those holy men have felt at this time!
