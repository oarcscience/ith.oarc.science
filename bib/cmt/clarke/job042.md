### [Job Chapter 42](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#001.md)

[Job](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">job 42:0</span></span>

Job humbles himself before God, [Job
42:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#001.md). God accepts him; censures his
three friends; and commands Job to offer sacrifices for then, that he
might pardon and accept them, as they had not spoken what was right
concerning their Maker, [Job 42:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#007.md).
The Lord turns Job's captivity; and his friends visit him, and bring him
presents, [Job 42:10](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#010.md), [Job
42:11](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#011.md). Job's affluence becomes double
to what it was before, [Job 42:12](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#012.md). His
family is also increased, [Job
42:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#013.md). Having lived one hundred and
forty years after his calamities, he dies, [Job
42:16](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#016.md), [Job
42:17](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#017.md).

[Job 42:2](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 42:2</span></span>

I know that thou canst do every thing - Thy power is unlimited; thy
wisdom infinite.

[Job 42:3](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 42:3</span></span>

Who is he that hideth counsel - These are the words of Job, and they are
a repetition of what Jehovah said, [Job
38:2](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#002.md) : "Who is this that darkeneth
counsel by words without knowledge?" Job now having heard the Almighty's
speech, and having received his reproof, echoes back his words: "Who is
he that hideth counsel without knowledge Alas, I am the man; I have
uttered what I understood not; things too wonderful for me, that I knew
not. God had said, [Job 38:3](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#003.md) : "Gird
up now thy loins like a man; I will demand of thee, and answer thou me."
In allusion to this, Job exclaims to his Maker, [Job
42:4](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#004.md) : "Hear, I beseech thee, and I
will speak: I will ask of Thee, and declare Thou unto Me." I acknowledge
my ignorance; I confess my foolishness and presumption; I am ashamed of
my conduct; I lament my imperfections; I implore thy mercy; and beg thee
to show me thy will, that I may ever think, speak, and do, what is
pleasing in thy sight.

Things too wonderful - I have spoken of thy judgments, which I did not
comprehend.

[Job 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 42:5</span></span>

I have heard of thee - I have now such a discovery of thee as I have
never had before. I have only heard of thee by tradition, or from
imperfect information; now the eye of my mind clearly perceives thee,
and in seeing thee, I see myself; for the light that discovers thy glory
and excellence, discovers my meanness and vileness.

[Job 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 42:6</span></span>

I abhor myself - Compared with thine, my strength is weakness; my
wisdom, folly; and my righteousness, impurity.

"I loathe myself when thee I see;

And into nothing fall."

Repent - I am deeply distressed on account of the imaginations of my
heart, the words of my tongue, and the acts of my life. I roll myself in
the dust, and sprinkle ashes upon my head. Job is now sufficiently
humbled at the feet of Jehovah; and having earnestly and piously prayed
for instruction, the Lord, in a finishing speech, which appears to be
contained in [Job 40:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#001.md), perfects
his teaching on the subject of the late controversy, which is concluded
with, "When thou canst act like the Almighty," which is, in effect, what
the questions and commands amount to in the preceding verses of that
chapter, "then will I also confess unto thee, that thy own right hand
can save thee." In the fifth verse of the fortieth chapter, Job says,
"Once have I spoken." This must refer to the declaration above, in the
beginning of this chapter, (42). And he goes on to state, [Job
40:5](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#005.md) : "Yea, Twice; but I will proceed
no farther." This second time is that in which he uses these words:
after which he spoke no more; and the Lord concluded with the remaining
part of these fourteen verses, viz., from [Job
40:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#007.md), inclusive. Then the thread of
the story, in the form of a narration is resumed at [Job
42:7](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#007.md).

[Job 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 42:7</span></span>

After the Lord had spoken these words - Those recorded at [Job
40:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#007.md); he said to Eliphaz, who was
the eldest of the three friends, and chief speaker: Ye have not spoken
of me - right. Mr. Peters observes, "It will be difficult to find any
thing in the speeches of Eliphaz and his companions which should make
the difference here supposed, if we set aside the doctrine of a future
state; for in this view the others would speak more worthily of God than
Job, by endeavoring to vindicate his providence in the exact
distribution of good and evil in this life: whereas Job's assertion,
[Job 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#022.md), 'This is one thing,
therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked,' which is
the argument on which he all along insists, would, upon this
supposition, be directly charging God that he made no distinction
between the good and the bad. But now, take the other life into the
account, and the thing will appear in quite a contrary light; and we
shall easily see the reason why God approves of the sentiments of Job,
and condemns those of his friends. For supposing the friends of Job to
argue that the righteous are never afflicted without remedy here, nor
the wicked prosperous on the whole in this life, which is a wrong
representation of God's providence; and Job to argue, on the other hand,
that the righteous are sometimes afflicted here, and that without
remedy, but shall be rewarded in the life to come; and that the wicked
prosper here, but shall be punished hereafter, which is the true
representation of the Divine proceedings; and here is a very apparent
difference in the drift of the one's discourse, and of the others'. For
Job, in this view, speaks worthily of God, and the rest unworthily. The
best moral argument that mankind have ever had to believe in a life to
come, is that which Job insists on - that good and evil are, for the
most part, dealt out here promiscuously. On the contrary, the topic
urged by his friends, and which they push a great deal too far, that God
rewards and punishes in this world, tends, in its consequences, like
that other opinion which was held by the stoics in after times, that
virtue is its own reward, to sap the very foundation of that proof we
have, from reason, of another life. No wonder, therefore, that the
sentiments of the one are approved, and those of the other condemned."

[Job 42:8](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 42:8</span></span>

Take - seven bullocks and seven rams - From this it appears that Job was
considered a priest, not only in his own family but also for others. For
his children he offered burnt-offerings, [Job
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#005.md); and now he is to make the same
kind of offerings, accompanied with intercession, in behalf of his three
friends. This is a full proof of the innocence and integrity of Job: a
more decided one could not be given, that the accusations of his
friends, and their bitter speeches, were as untrue as they were
malevolent. God thus clears his character, and confounds their devices.

[Job 42:10](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 42:10</span></span>

The Lord turned the captivity of Job - The Vulgate has: Dominus quoque
conversus est ad poenitentiam Job; "And the Lord turned Job to
repentance." The Chaldee: "The Word of the Lord (מימרא דיי meymera
dayai) turned the captivity of Job." There is a remark which these words
suggest, which has been rarely, if at all, noticed. It is said that the
Lord turned the captivity of Job When He Prayed for His Friends. He had
suffered much through the unkindness of these friends; they had
criticised his conduct without feeling or mercy; and he had just cause
to be irritated against them: and that he had such a feeling towards
them, several parts of his discourses sufficiently prove. God was now
about to show Job his mercy; but mercy can be shown only to the
merciful; Job must forgive his unfeeling friends, if he would be
forgiven by the Lord; he directs him, therefore, to pray for them, [Job
42:8](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#008.md). He who can pray for another
cannot entertain enmity against him: Job did so, and when he prayed for
his friends, God turned the captivity of Job. "Forgive, and ye shall be
forgiven." Some suppose that Job, being miraculously restored, armed his
servants and remaining friends, and fell upon those who had spoiled him;
and not only recovered his own property, but also spoiled the spoilers,
and thus his substance became double what it was before. Of this I do
not see any intimation in the sacred text.

[Job 42:11](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 42:11</span></span>

Then came there unto him all his brethren - "Job being restored to his
former health and fortunes, the author," says Mr. Heath, "presents us
with a striking view of human friendship. His brethren, who, in the time
of his affliction, kept at a distance from him; his kinsfolk, who ceased
to know him; his familiar friends, who had forgotten him; and his
acquaintance, who had made themselves perfect strangers to him; those to
whom he had showed kindness, and who yet had ungratefully neglected him,
on the return of his prosperity now come and condole with him, desirous
of renewing former familiarity; and, according to the custom of the
Eastern countries, where there is no approaching a great man without a
present, each brings him a kesitah, each a jewel of gold." See [Job
42:12](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#012.md).

A piece of money - קשיטה kesitah signifies a lamb; and it is supposed
that this piece of money had a lamb stamped on it, as that quantity of
gold was generally the current value for a lamb. See my note on [Gen
33:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#019) (note.md), where the subject is
largely considered. The Vulgate, Chaldee, Septuagint, Arabic, and
Syriac, have one lamb or sheep; so it appears that they did not
understand the kesitah as implying a piece of money of any kind, but a
sheep or a lamb.

Earring of gold - Literally, a nose-jewel. The Septuagint translate,
τετραδραχμον χρυσου, a tetra-drachm of gold, or golden daric; but by
adding και ασημου, unstamped, they intimate that it was four drachms of
uncoined gold.

[Job 42:12](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 42:12</span></span>

The Lord blessed the latter end of Job - Was it not in consequence of
his friends bringing him a lamb, sheep, or other kind of cattle, and the
quantity of gold mentioned, that his stock of sheep was increased so
speedily to 14,000, his camels to 6000, his oxen to 2000, and his
she-asses to 1000? Mr. Heath takes the story of the conduct of Job's
friends by the worst handle; see [Job
42:11](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#011.md). Is it not likely that they
themselves were the cause of his sudden accumulation of property? and
that they did not visit him, nor seek his familiarity because he was now
prosperous; but because they saw that God had turned his captivity, and
miraculously healed him? This gave them full proof of his innocence, and
they no longer considered him an anathema, or devoted person, whom they
should avoid and detest, but one who had been suffering under a strange
dispensation of Divine Providence, and who was now no longer a
suspicious character, but a favourite of heaven, to whom they should
show every possible kindness. They therefore joined hands with God to
make the poor man live and their presents were the cause, under God of
his restoration to affluence. This takes the subject by the other
handle; and I think, as far as the text is concerned, by the right one.

He had fourteen thousand sheep - The reader, by referring to [Job
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#003.md), will perceive that the whole of
Job's property was exactly doubled.

[Job 42:13](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 42:13</span></span>

Seven sons and three daughters - This was the same number as before; and
so the Vulgate, Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic read: but the Chaldee
doubles the sons, "And he had fourteen sons, and three daughters."

[Job 42:14](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 42:14</span></span>

The name of the first Jemima - ימימה yemimah, days upon days. Kezia -
קציעה ketsiah, cassia, a well-known aromatic plant.

And, Keren-happuch - קרן הפוך keren happuch, the inverted or flowing
horn, cornucopiae, the horn of plenty. The Chaldee will not permit these
names to pass without a comment, to show the reason of their imposition:
"He called the first Jemimah, because she was as fair as the day; the
second Ketsiah, because she was as precious as cassia; the third
Keren-happuch, because her face was as splendid as the emerald."
Cardmarden's Bible, 1566, has the Hebrew names. The Vulgate has, "He
called the name of one Day, of the second Cassia, and of the third The
Horn of Antimony." The versions in general preserve these names, only
the Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic translate Jemimah, Day; and the
former for Keren-happuch has Αμαλθαιας κερας, the horn of Amalthea. This
refers to an ancient fable. Amalthea was the nurse of Jupiter, and fed
him with goat's milk when he was young. The goat having by accident her
horn struck off, Jupiter translated the animal to the heavens, and gave
her a place among the constellations, which she still holds; and made
the horn the emblem of plenty: hence it is always pictured or described
as filled with fruits, flowers, and the necessaries and luxuries of
life. It is very strange how this fable got into the Septuagint.

Coverdale is singular: The first he called Daye, the seconde Poverte,
the thirde, All plenteousnes.

[Job 42:15](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 42:15</span></span>

Gave them inheritance among their brethren - This seems to refer to the
history of the daughters of Zelophehad, given [Num
28:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#001.md), who appear to have been the
first who were allowed an inheritance among their brethren.

[Job 42:16](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 42:16</span></span>

After this lived Job a hundred and forty years - How long he had lived
before his afflictions, we cannot tell. If we could rely on the
Septuagint, all would be plain, who add here, Τα δε παντα ετη εζησεν,
διακοσια τεσσαρακοντα; "And all the years that Job lived were two
hundred and forty." This makes him one hundred years of age when his
trial commenced. Coverdale has, After this lyved Job forty yeares,
omitting the hundred. So also in Becke's Bible, 1549. From the age, as
marked down in the Hebrew text, we can infer nothing relative to the
time when Job lived. See the subscription at the end of the Arabic.

[Job 42:17](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 42:17</span></span>

Job died, being old and full of days - He had seen life in all its
varieties; he had risen higher than all the men of the East, and sunk
lower in affliction, poverty, and distress, than any other human being
that had existed before, or has lived since. He died when he was
satisfied with this life; this the word שבע seba implies. He knew the
worst and the best of human life; and in himself the whole history of
Providence was exemplified and illustrated, and many of its mysteries
unfolded.

We have now seen the end of the life of Job, and the end or design which
God had in view by his afflictions and trials, in which he has shown us
that he is very pitiful, and of tender mercy, [Jam
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#011.md); and to discern this end of the
Lord should be the object of every person who reads or studies it. Laus
in excelsis Deo!

Both in the Arabic and Septuagint there is a considerable and important
addition at the end of the seventeenth verse, which extends to many
lines; of this, with its variations, I have given a translation in the
Preface.

At the end of the Syriac version we have the following subscription: -

"The Book of the righteous and renowned Job is finished, and contains
2553 verses."

At the end of the Arabic is the following: -

"It is completed by the assistance of the Most High God. The author of
this copy would record that this book has been translated into Arabic
from the Syriac language." "Glory be to God, the giver of
understanding!" "The Book of Job is completed; and his age was two
hundred and forty years." "Praise be to God for ever!"

So closely does the Arabic translator copy the Syriac, that in the
Polyglots one Latin version serves for both, with the exception of a few
marginal readings at the bottom of the column to show where the Syriac
varies.
