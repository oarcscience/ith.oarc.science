### [2 Chronicles Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 33:0</span></span>

Manasseh reigns fifty-five years, and restores idolatry, pollutes the
temple, and practises all kinds of abominations, [Ch2
33:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#001.md). He and the people are warned
in vain, [Ch2 33:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#010.md). He is delivered
into the hands of the Assyrians, bound with fetters, and carried to
Babylon, [Ch2 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#011.md). He humbles
himself, and is restored, [Ch2 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#012.md),
[Ch2 33:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#013.md). He destroys idolatry, and
restores the worship of God, [Ch2
33:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#014.md). The people keep the high
places, but sacrifice to the Lord on them, [Ch2
33:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#017.md). His acts, prayer, and death,
[Ch2 33:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#018.md). His son Amon succeeds
him; and after a wicked idolatrous reign of two years, is slain by his
own servants in his own house, [Ch2
33:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#021.md). The people rise up, and slay
his murderers, and make Josiah his son king in his stead, [Ch2
33:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#025.md).

[2 Chronicles 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 33:1</span></span>

Manasseh was twelve years old - We do not find that he had any godly
director; his youth was therefore the more easily seduced. But surely he
had a pious education; how then could the principles of it be so soon
eradicated?

[2 Chronicles 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 33:3</span></span>

Altars for Baalim - The Sun and Moon. And made groves, אשרות Asheroth,
Astarte, Venus; the host of heaven, all the Planets and Stars. These
were the general objects of his devotion.

[2 Chronicles 33:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 33:5</span></span>

He built altars - See the principal facts in this chapter explained in
the notes on 2 Kings 21:1-17 (note).

[2 Chronicles 33:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 33:7</span></span>

A carved image - "He set up an image, the likeness of himself, in the
house of the sanctuary." The Targumist supposes he wished to procure
himself Divine honors.

[2 Chronicles 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 33:12</span></span>

And when he was in affliction - Here is a very large addition in the
Chaldee: "For the Chaldeans made a brazen mule, pierced full of small
holes, and put him within it, and kindled fires all around it; and when
he was in this misery, he sought help of all the idols which he had
made, but obtained none, for their were of no use. He therefore
repented, and prayed before the Lord his God, and was greatly humbled in
the sight of the Lord God of his fathers."

[2 Chronicles 33:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 33:13</span></span>

And prayed unto him - "While he was thus praying, all the presiding
angels went away to the gates of prayer in heaven; and shut all the
gates of prayer, and all the windows and apertures in heaven, lest that
his prayer should be heard. Immediately the compassions of the Creator
of the world were moved, whose right hand is stretched out to receive
sinners, who are converted to his fear, and break their hearts'
concupiscence by repentance. He made therefore a window and opening in
heaven, under the throne of his glory; and having heard his prayer, he
favourably received his supplication. And when his Word had shaken the
earth, the mule was burst and he escaped. Then the Spirit went out from
between the wings of the cherubim; by which, being inspired through the
decree of the Word of the Lord, he returned to his kingdom in Jerusalem.
And then Manasseh knew that it was the Lord God who had done these
miracles and signs; and he turned to the Lord with his whole heart, left
all his idols, and never served them more." This long addition gives the
Jewish account of those particulars which the sacred writer has passed
by: it is curious, though in some sort trifling. The gates of prayer may
be considered childish; but in most of those things the ancient rabbins
purposely hid deep and important meanings.

[2 Chronicles 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 33:14</span></span>

He built a wall - This was probably a weak place that he fortified; or a
part of the wall which the Assyrians had broken down, which he now
rebuilt.

[2 Chronicles 33:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 33:15</span></span>

He took away the strange gods - He appears to have done every thing in
his power to destroy the idolatry which he had set up, and to restore
the pure worship of the true God. His repentance brought forth fruits
meet for repentance. How long he was in captivity, and when or by whom
he was delivered, we know not. The fact of his restoration is asserted;
and we believe it on Divine testimony.

[2 Chronicles 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 33:17</span></span>

The people did sacrifice - "Nevertheless the people did sacrifice on the
high places, but only to the name of the Word of the Lord their God." -
Targum.

[2 Chronicles 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 33:18</span></span>

The words of the seers that spake to him - "Which were spoken to him in
the name of the Word of the Lord God of Israel." - Targum.

[2 Chronicles 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch2 33:19</span></span>

His prayer also - What is called the Prayer of Manasseh, king of Judah,
when he was holden captive in Babylon, being found among our apocryphal
books, I have inserted it at the end of the chapter, without either
asserting or thinking that it is the identical prayer which this
penitent king used when a captive in Babylon. But, as I have observed in
another place, there are many good sentiments in it; and some sinners
may find it a proper echo of the distresses of their hearts; I therefore
insert it.

Written among the sayings of the seers - "They are written in the words
of Chozai." - Targum. So says the Vulgate. The Syriac has Hunan the
prophet; and the Arabic has Saphan the prophet.

[2 Chronicles 33:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 33:21</span></span>

Amon - reigned two years - See on [Kg2
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#019) (note.md).

[2 Chronicles 33:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch2 33:22</span></span>

Sacrificed unto all the carved images - How astonishing is this! with
his father's example before his eyes, he copies his father's vices, but
not his repentance.

[2 Chronicles 33:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch2 33:23</span></span>

Trespassed more and more - He appears to have exceeded his father, and
would take no warning.

[2 Chronicles 33:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch2 33:24</span></span>

His servants conspired against him - On what account we cannot tell.

[2 Chronicles 33:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch2 33:25</span></span>

The people of the land slew all them - His murder was not a popular act,
for the people slew the regicides. They were as prone to idolatry as
their king was. We may rest satisfied that idolatry was accompanied with
great licentiousness and sensual gratifications else it never, as a mere
religious system, could have had any sway in the world.

For an explanation of the term groves, [Ch2
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#003.md), see the observations at the end
of [Kg2 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#026) (note.md).

I have referred to the prayer attributed to Manasseh, and found in what
is called the Apocrypha, just before the first book of Maccabees. It was
anciently used as a form of confession in the Christian Church, and is
still as such received by the Greek Church. It is as follows: -

"O Lord, Almighty God of our fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and of
their righteous seed, who hast made heaven and earth, with all the
ornament thereof; who hast bound the sea by the word of thy commandment;
who hast shut up the deep, and sealed it by thy terrible and glorious
name; whom all men fear, and tremble before thy power; for the majesty
of thy glory cannot be borne, and thine angry threatening towards
sinners is insupportable; but thy merciful promise is unmeasurable and
unsearchable; for thou art the most high Lord, of great compassion,
long-suffering, very merciful, and repentest of the evils of men. Thou,
O Lord, according to thy great goodness, hast promised repentance and
forgiveness to them that have sinned against thee, and of thine infinite
mercies hast appointed repentance unto sinners, that they may be saved.
Thou, therefore, O Lord, that art the God of the just, has not appointed
repentance to the just, as to Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, which have
not sinned against thee; but thou hast appointed repentance unto me that
am a sinner: for I have sinned above the number of the sands of the sea.
My transgressions, O Lord, are multiplied; my transgressions are
multiplied; and I am not worthy to behold and see the height of heaven
for the multitude of mine iniquities. I am bowed down with many iron
bands, that I cannot lift up mine head, neither have any release; for I
have provoked thy wrath, and done evil before thee. I did not thy will,
neither kept I thy commandments. I have set up abominations, and have
multiplied offenses. Now therefore I bow the knee of mine heart,
beseeching thee of grace. I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, and I
acknowledge mine iniquities: wherefore I humbly beseech thee, forgive
me, O Lord, forgive me, and destroy me not in mine iniquities. Be not
angry with me for ever, by reserving evil for me; neither condemn me
into the lower parts of the earth. For thou art the God, the God of them
that repent; and in me thou wilt show all thy goodness: for thou wilt
save me, that am unworthy, according to thy great mercy. Therefore I
will praise thee for ever all the days of my life: for all the powers of
the heavens do praise thee, and thine is the glory for ever and ever. -
Amen."

The above translation, which is that in our common Bibles, might be
mended; but the piece is scarcely worth the pains.
