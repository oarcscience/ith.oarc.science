### [Psalms Chapter 121](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 121:0</span></span>

The resolution of a godly man, [Psa
121:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001), [Psa
121:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#002). The safety and prosperity of
such, as they and theirs shall be under the continual protection of God,
[Psa 121:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#003).

This appears to be a prayer of the Jews in their captivity, who are
solicitous for their restoration. It is in the form of a dialogue.

[Psa 121:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001), [Psa
121:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#002). The person who worships God
speaks the two first verses, "I will lift up mine eyes-my help cometh,"
- [Psa 121:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001), [Psa
121:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#002).

[Psa 121:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#003). The ministering priest
answers him, "He will not suffer thy foot to be moved." "He that keepeth
thee will not slumber," [Psa 121:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#003).

To which the worshipper answers, that he knows that "he who keepeth
Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep," [Psa
121:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#004); but he seems to express a doubt
whether he shall be an object of the Divine attention.

[Psa 121:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#005) etc. The priest resumes;
and, to the conclusion of the Psalm, gives him the most positive
assurances of God's favor and protection.

[Psalms 121:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 121:1</span></span>

Unto the hills - Jerusalem was built upon a mountain; and Judea was a
mountainous country; and the Jews, in their several dispersions, turned
towards Jerusalem when they offered up their prayers to God.

[Psalms 121:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 121:2</span></span>

My help cometh from the Lord - There is no help for me but in my God;
and I expect it from no other quarter.

[Psalms 121:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 121:3</span></span>

He will not suffer thy foot to be moved - The foundation, God's infinite
power and goodness, on which thou standest, cannot be moved; and whilst
thou standest on this basis, thy foot cannot be moved.

[Psalms 121:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 121:4</span></span>

He that keepeth Israel - The Divine Being represents himself as a
watchman, who takes care of the city and its inhabitants during the
night-watches; and who is never overtaken with slumbering or sleepiness.
There is a thought in the Antigone of Sophocles, that seems the
counterpart of this of the psalmist,

Ταν σαν, Ζευ, δυναμιν τις ανδρων

Ὑπερβασια κατασχοι,

Ταν ουθ' ὑπνος αἱ -

ρει ποθ' ὁ παντογηρως,

Ακαματοι τε θεων

Μηνες;

Antig. ver. 613, Edit. Johnson.

Shall men below control great Jove above,Whose eyes by all-subduing
sleep

Are never closed, as feeble mortals' are;But still their watchful vigil
keep

Through the long circle of th' eternal year?

Franklin.

[Psalms 121:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 121:6</span></span>

The sun shall not smite thee by day - Thus expressed by the Chaldee:
"The morning spectres shall not smite thee by day, during the government
of the sun; nor the nocturnal spectres by night, during the government
of the moon." I believe the psalmist simply means, they shall not be
injured by heat nor cold; by a sun-stroke by day, nor a frost-bite by
night.

[Psalms 121:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 121:7</span></span>

The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil - Spiritual and corporeal,
natural and moral.

He shall preserve thy soul - Take care of thy life, and take care of thy
soul.

[Psalms 121:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 121:8</span></span>

Thy going out and thy coming in - Night and day - in all thy business
and undertakings; and this through the whole course of thy life: for
evermore.
