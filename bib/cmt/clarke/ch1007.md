### [1 Chronicles Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 7:0</span></span>

The genealogy of Issachar, [Ch1 7:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#001.md).
Of Benjamin, [Ch1 7:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#006.md). Of Naphtali,
[Ch1 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#013.md). Of Manasseh, [Ch1
7:14-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#014.md). Of Ephraim, [Ch1
7:20-29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#020.md). And of Asher, [Ch1
7:30-40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#030.md).

[1 Chronicles 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 7:2</span></span>

Whose number was in the days of David - Whether this was the number
returned by Joab and his assistants, when they made that census of the
people with which God was so much displeased, we know not. It is worthy
of remark that we read here the sum of three tribes, Benjamin, Issachar,
and Asher, under the reign of David, which is mentioned nowhere else;
and yet we have no account here of the other tribes, probably because
the author found no public registers in which such enumeration was
recorded.

[1 Chronicles 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 7:3</span></span>

The sons of Izrahiah - five - There are, however, only four names in the
text. Instead of five, the Syriac and Arabic read four. If five be the
true reading, then Izrahiah must be reckoned with his four sons.

[1 Chronicles 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 7:6</span></span>

The sons of Benjamin; Bela, and Becher and Jediael - In [Gen
46:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#021.md), ten sons of Benjamin are
reckoned; viz., Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Eri, Rosh, Muppim,
Huppim, and Ard. In [Num 26:38](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#038.md), etc.,
five sons only of Benjamin are mentioned, Bela, Ashbel, Ahiram, Shupham,
and Hupham: and Ard and Naaman are there said to be the sons of Bela;
consequently grandsons of Benjamin. In the beginning of the following
chapter, five sons of Benjamin are mentioned, viz., Bela, Ashbel,
Aharah, Nohah, and Rapha; where also Addar, Gera, Abihud, Abishua,
Naaman, Ahoah, a second Gera, Shephuphan, and Huram, are all represented
as grandsons, not sons, of Benjamin: hence we see that in many cases
grandsons are called sons, and both are often confounded in the
genealogical tables. To attempt to reconcile such discrepancies would be
a task as endless as it would be useless. The rabbins say that Ezra, who
wrote this book, did not know whether some of these were sons or
grandsons; and they intimate also that the tables from which he copied
were often defective, and here we must leave all such matters.

[1 Chronicles 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch1 7:21</span></span>

Whom the men of Gath - slew - We know nothing of this circumstance but
what is related here. The Targum paraphrases the whole thus: "These were
the leaders of the house of Ephraim; and they computed their period \[or
boundary, כיצא kitsa\] from the time in which the Word of the Lord of
the universe spake with Abraham between the divisions, \[i.e., the
separated parts of the covenant sacrifice; see [Gen
15:9-21](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#009.md)\], but they erred, for they
should have counted from the time in which Isaac was born; they went out
of Egypt therefore thirty years before the period: for, thirty years
before the birth of Isaac the Word of the Lord of the universe spake
with Abraham between the divisions. And when they went out of Egypt,
there were with them two hundred thousand warriors of the tribe of
Ephraim, whom the men of Gath, the natives of the land of the
Philistines, slew, because they came down that they might carry away
their cattle. 22. - And Ephraim their father mourned for them many days,
and all his brethren came to comfort him. 23. - And he went in to his
wife, and she conceived and bare a son, and called his name Beriah,
(בריעה in evil), because he was born in the time in which this evil
happened to his house.

[1 Chronicles 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch1 7:24</span></span>

His daughter was Sherah - That is, remnant; "called so," says the
Targum, "because she was the remnant that escaped from the slaughter
mentioned above."

[1 Chronicles 7:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">ch1 7:32</span></span>

And Shua their sister - It is very rarely that women are found in the
Jewish genealogies, and they are never inserted but for especial
reasons.

[1 Chronicles 7:40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">ch1 7:40</span></span>

The children of Asher - The rabbins say that the daughters of Asher were
very beautiful, and were all matched with kings or priests. Several
things relative to the subjects in this chapter may be found explained
in the parallel places marked in the margin.
