### [Psalms Chapter 47](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 47:0</span></span>

The Gentiles are invited to celebrate the praises of God as the
Sovereign of the world, [Psa 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#001.md),
[Psa 47:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#002.md). The Jews exalt in his
kindness to them, [Psa 47:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#003.md), [Psa
47:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#004.md). All then join to celebrate his
Majesty, as reigniny over the heathen, and gathering the dispersed Jews
and Gentiles together into one Church, [Psa
47:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#005.md).

The title, "A Psalm for the sons of Korah," has nothing remarkable in
it. The Psalm was probably written about the same time with the
preceding, and relates to the happy state of the Jews when returned to
their own land. They renewed their praises and promises of obedienee,
and celebrate him for the deliverance they had received. See the
introduction to [Psa 46:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001) (note.md).
In a spiritual sense, it appears to relate to the calling of the
Gentiles to be made partakers of the blessings of the Gospel with the
converted Jews.

[Psalms 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 47:1</span></span>

O clap your hands, all ye people - Let both Jews and Gentiles magnify
the Lord: the Jews, for being delivered from the Babylonish captivity;
the Gentiles, for being called to enter into the glorious liberty of the
children of God.

[Psalms 47:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 47:2</span></span>

For the Lord most high is terrible - He has insufferable majesty, and is
a great King - the mightiest of all emperors, for he is Sovereign over
the whole earth.

[Psalms 47:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 47:3</span></span>

He shall subdue the people under us - He shall do again for us what he
had done for our forefathers - give us dominion over our enemies, and
establish us in our own land. I would rather read this in the past
tense, relative to what God did for their fathers in destroying the
Canaanites, and giving them the promised land for their possession, and
taking the people for his own inheritance. This is also applied to the
conversion of the Gentiles who, on the rejection of the Jews, have
become his inheritance; and whom he has chosen to inherit all those
spiritual blessings typified by the sacrifices and other significant
rites and ceremonies of the Jewish Church.

[Psalms 47:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 47:5</span></span>

God is gone up with a shout - Primarily, this may refer to the rejoicing
and sounding of trumpets, when the ark was lifted up to be carried on
the shoulders of the Levites. But it is generally understood as a
prophetic declaration of the ascension of our Lord Jesus Christ; and the
shout may refer to the exultation of the evangelists and apostles in
preaching Christ crucified, buried, risen from the dead, and ascended to
heaven, ever to appear in the presence of God for us. This was the
triumph of the apostles; and the conversion of multitudes of souls by
this preaching was the triumph of the cross of Christ.

[Psalms 47:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 47:6</span></span>

Sing praises - זמרו zammeru: this word is four times repeated in this
short verse, and shows at once the earnestness and happiness of the
people. They are the words of exultation and triumph. Feel your
obligation to God; express it in thanksgiving: be thankful, be eternally
thankful, to God your King.

[Psalms 47:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 47:7</span></span>

For God is the King of all the earth - He is not your King only, but the
King of the universe. He has no limited power, no confined dominion.

Sing ye praises with understanding - זמרו משכיל zammeru maskil, sing an
instructive song. Let sense and sound go together. Let your hearts and
heads go with your voices. Understand what you sing; and feel what you
understand; and let the song be what will give instruction in
righteousness to them that hear it. Sing wisely - Anglo-Saxon.
Multitudes sing foolishly.

[Psalms 47:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 47:8</span></span>

God reigneth over the heathen - Though this is literally true in God's
universal dominion, yet more is here meant. God reigns over the heathen
when, by the preaching of the Gospel, they are brought into the Church
of Christ.

God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness - He is a holy God; he
proclaims holiness. His laws are holy, he requires holiness, and his
genuine people are all holy. The throne of his holiness is the heaven of
heavens; also the temple at Jerusalem; and, lastly, the hearts of the
faithful.

[Psalms 47:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 47:9</span></span>

The princes of the people are gathered together - נדיבי עמים nedibey
ammim. The voluntary people - the princely, noble, or free-willed
people; those who gladly receive the word of life; those who, like the
Bereans, were of a noble or liberal disposition; and, when they heard
the Gospel, searched the Scriptures to see whether these things were so.
It is a similar word which is used [Psa
100:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#003.md); and I believe both texts speak
of the same people - the Gentiles who gladly come unto his light, and
present themselves a free-will offering to the Lord.

The people or the God of Abraham - Who were Abraham's people? Not the
Jews; the covenant was made with him while yet in urcircumcision.
Properly speaking, the Gentiles are those whom he represented; for the
covenant was made with him while yet a Gentile; and in his seed all the
nations - the Gentiles, of the earth were to be blessed. The people of
the God of Abraham are the Gentiles who, receiving the Gospel, are made
partakers of the faith of Abraham, and are his spiritual children. The
God of Abraham has Abraham's spiritual posterity, the believing
Gentiles, for his own people.

The shields of the earth belong unto God - The Septuagint translate this
οἱ κραταιοι, the strong ones of the earth. The Vulgate reads, Quoniam
dii fortes terrae vehementer elevati sunt; "Because the strong gods of
the earth are exceedingly exalted." These are supposed to mean kings and
rulers of provinces which were present at the dedication of the temple;
(for some suppose the Psalm to have been composed for this solemnity);
and that they are said here to be greatly exalted, because they
exercised a very high degree of power over their respective districts.
The words refer to something by which the inhabitants of the earth are
defended; God's providence, guardian angels, etc., etc.

He is greatly exalted - Great as secular rulers are, God is greater, and
is above all; King of kings and Lord of lords; and the hearts of kings
and governors are in his hand; and he turns them whithersoever he
pleases.
