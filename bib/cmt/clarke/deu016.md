### [Deuteronomy Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 16:0</span></span>

The month of Abib to be observed, [Deu
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#001). The feast of the passover and of
unleavened bread, [Deu 16:2-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#002). The
feast of weeks, [Deu 16:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#009). The
feast of tabernacles, [Deu 16:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#013).
All the males to appear before the Lord thrice in the year, none to come
empty, each to give according to his ability, [Deu
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#016), [Deu
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#017). Judges and officers to be made
in all their cities, [Deu 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#018).
Strict justice shall be executed, [Deu
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#019), [Deu
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#020). No grove to be planted near the
altar of God, nor any image to be set up, [Deu
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#021), [Deu
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#022).

[Deuteronomy 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 16:1</span></span>

Keep the passover - A feast so called because the angel that destroyed
the firstborn of the Egyptians, seeing the blood of the appointed
sacrifice sprinkled on the lintels and door-posts of the Israelites'
houses, passed over Them, and did not destroy any of their firstborn.
See the notes on [Exo 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#002), and [Exo
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#003) (note), etc.

[Deuteronomy 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 16:3</span></span>

Bread of affliction - Because, being baked without leaven, it was
unsavoury, and put them in mind of their afflictive bondage in Egypt.

[Deuteronomy 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 16:11</span></span>

Thou shalt rejoice - The offerings of the Israelites were to be eaten
with festivity, communicated to their friends with liberality, and
bestowed on the poor with great generosity, that they might partake with
them in these repasts with joy before the Lord. To answer these views it
was necessary to eat the flesh while it was fresh, as in that climate
putrefaction soon took place; therefore they were commanded to let
nothing remain until the morning, [Deu
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#004). This consideration is sufficient
to account for the command here, without having recourse to those moral
and evangelical reasons that are assigned by the learned and devout Mr.

Ainsworth for the command. How beneficent and cheerful is the design of
this institution! - Harmer, vol. i., p. 396.

[Deuteronomy 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 16:16</span></span>

Three times in a year - See [Exo 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#014)
(note), where all the Jewish feasts are explained. See also [Lev
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#034) (note).

[Deuteronomy 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 16:18</span></span>

Judges and officers shalt thou make - Judges, שפטים shophetim, among the
Hebrews, were probably the same as our magistrates or justices of the
peace. Officers, שטרים shoterim, seem to have been the same as our
inquest sergeants, beadles, etc., whose office it was to go into the
houses, shops, etc., and examine weights, measures, and the civil
conduct of the people. When they found any thing amiss, they brought the
person offending before the magistrate, and he was punished by the
officer on the spot. They seem also to have acted as heralds in the
army, [Deu 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#005). See also Rab. Maimon
in Sanhedrin. In China, for all minor offenses, the person when found
guilty is punished on the spot, in the presence of the magistrate or
mandarin of justice.

[Deuteronomy 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">deu 16:21</span></span>

Thou shalt not plant thee a grove, etc. - We have already seen that
groves were planted about idol temples for the purpose of the obscene
worship performed in them. (See on [Deu
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#003) (note)). On this account God
would have no groves or thickets about his altar, that there might be no
room for suspicion that any thing contrary to the strictest purity was
transacted there. Every part of the Divine worship was publicly
performed, for the purpose of general edification.
