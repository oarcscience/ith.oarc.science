Preface to the Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians

For an account of Thessalonica, and St. Paul's labors there, the reader
is requested to consult the preface to the preceding epistle. That this
second epistle was written shortly after the first, and from the same
place too, is very probable, from this circumstance, that the same
persons, Paul, Silvanus, and Timotheus, who addressed the Church at
Thessalonica in the former epistle, address the same Church in this; and
as three such apostolic men were rarely long together in the same place,
it is very likely that the two epistles were written not only in the
same year, but also within a very short time of each other. It appears
that the person who carried the first epistle returned speedily to
Corinth, and gave the apostle a particular account of the state of the
Thessalonian Church; and, among other things, informed him that many
were in expectation of the speedy arrival of the day of judgment; and
that they inferred from his epistle already sent, [Th1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#015.md), [Th1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#017.md); [Th1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#004.md), [Th1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#006.md), that it was to take place while
the apostle and themselves should be yet alive. And it appears probable,
from some parts of this epistle, that he was informed also that some,
expecting this sudden appearance of the Lord Jesus, had given up all
their secular concerns as inconsistent with a due preparation for such
an important and awful event; see [Th2
3:6-13](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#006.md). To correct such a
misapprehension, and redeem them from an error, which, if appearing to
rest on the authority of an apostle, must in its issue be ruinous to the
cause of Christianity, St. Paul would feel himself constrained to write
immediately; and this is a sufficient reason why these epistles should
appear to have been written at so short a distance from each other. What
rendered this speedy intervention of the apostle's authority and
direction the more necessary, was, that there appear to have been some
in that Church who professed to have a revelation concerning this thing,
and to have endeavored to confirm it by a pretended report from the
apostle himself, and from the words already referred to in the former
epistle; see here on [Th2 2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#001.md)
(note): "We beseech you, brethren, be not soon shaken in mind, or be
troubled, neither by Spirit, nor by Word, nor by Letter as from us, as
that the day of Christ is at hand." As the apostle, in this epistle,
[Th2 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#002.md), entreats the Thessalonians
to pray the Lord that he and his companions might be delivered from
unreasonable and wicked men, Dr. Macknight supposes that the epistle was
written soon after the insurrection of the Jews at Corinth, in which
they dragged Paul before Gallio, the proconsul of Achaia, and accused
him of persuading men to worship God contrary to the law; [Act
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#013.md). This argument places it also in
the year 52, or 53, in the twelfth or thirteenth of Claudius the
successor of Caius.

As there have been some eminent Christian writers who have entertained
the same opinion with those at Thessalonica, that not only St. Paul, but
other apostles of Christ, did believe that the day of general judgment
should take place in their time, which opinion is shown by the event to
be absolutely false; it appears to be a matter of the utmost consequence
to the credit of Divine revelation, to rescue the character of the
apostles from such an imputation. Dr. Macknight has written well on this
subject, as the following extract from his preface to this epistle will
prove: -

"Grotius, Locke, and others," says he, "have affirmed that the apostles
believed that the end of the world was to happen in their time; and that
they have declared this to be their belief in various passages of their
epistles. But these learned men, and all who join them in that opinion,
have fallen into a most pernicious error; for thereby they destroy the
authority of the Gospel revelation, at least as far as it is contained
in the discourses and writings of the apostles; because, if they have
erred in a matter of such importance, and which they affirm was revealed
to them by Christ, they may have been mistaken in other matters also,
where their inspiration is not more strongly asserted by them than in
this instance. It is therefore necessary to clear them from so injurious
an imputation.

"And first, with respect to Paul, who was an apostle of Christ, and
Silvanus, who was a prophet, and a chief man among the brethren, and
Timothy, who was eminent for his spiritual gifts, I observe that the
epistle under our consideration affords the clearest proof that these
men knew the truth concerning the coming of Christ to judge the world;
for in it they expressly assured the Thessalonians that the persons who
made them believe the day of judgment was at hand were deceiving them;
that, before the day of judgment, there was to be a great apostasy in
religion, occasioned by the man of sin, who at that time was restrained
from showing himself, but who was to be revealed in his season; that,
when revealed, he will sit, that is, remain a long time in the Church of
God, as God, and showing himself that he is God; and that, afterwards,
he is to be destroyed. Now, as these events could not be accomplished in
the course of a few years, the persons who foretold they were to happen
before the coming of Christ certainly did not think the day of judgment
would be in their lifetime. Besides, St. Paul, [Rom
11:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#023.md), by a long chain of
reasoning, having showed that, after the general conversion of the
Gentiles, the Jews, in a body, are to be brought into the Christian
Church, can any person be so absurd as to persevere in maintaining that
this apostle believed the end of the world would happen in his lifetime?

"Next, with respect to the Apostle Peter, I think it plain, from the
manner in which he has spoken of the coming of Christ, that he knew it
was at a great distance; [Pe2 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#003.md),
[Pe2 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#004.md), [Pe2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#008.md), [Pe2
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#009.md) : 'Knowing this first, that
scoffers will come in the last days, walking after their own lusts, and
saying, Where is the promise of his coming? For, from the time the
fathers fell asleep, all things continue as at the beginning of the
creation. But this one thing, let it not escape you, beloved, that one
day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one
day. The Lord, who hath promised, doth not delay, in the manner some
account delaying.' Now, seeing Peter has here foretold that, in the last
age, the wicked will mock at the promise of Christ's coming, on account
of its being long delayed; and, from the stability and regularity of the
course of nature during so many ages, will argue that there is no
probability that the world will ever come to an end; it is evident that
he also knew the coming of Christ to judgement was at a very great
distance at the time he wrote that epistle.

"The same may be said of James; for, in the hearing of the apostles,
elders, and brethren assembled in the council of Jerusalem, he quoted
passages from the Jewish prophets, to show that all the Gentiles were,
at some future period, to seek after the Lord; [Act
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#017.md). But, if James looked for the
general conversion of the Gentiles, he certainly could not imagine the
end of the world would happen in his time.

"Lastly, the Apostle John, in his book of the Revelation, having
foretold a great variety of important events respecting the political
and religious state of the world, which could not be accomplished in a
few years, but required a series of ages to give them birth; there
cannot be the least doubt that he likewise knew the truth concerning his
Master's second coming; and therefore, to suppose that he imagined the
day of judgment was to happen in his own lifetime, is a palpable
mistake.

"Upon the whole, seeing the apostles and other inspired teachers of our
religion certainly knew that the coming of Christ to judgment was at a
great distance, every impartial person must be sensible they have been
much injured, not by the enemies of revelation alone, but by some of its
friends; who, upon the strength of certain expressions, the meaning, of
which they evidently misunderstood, have endeavored to persuade the
world that the apostle ignorantly believed the day of judgment was at
hand. These expressions may all be applied to other events, as shall be
showed in the next section, and therefore they ought to be so applied;
because candour requires that sense to be put on an author's words which
renders him most consistent with himself." As the term coming of Christ
has several acceptations in the sacred writings, and the applying any
one of these to the subject to which in a given place it does not
belong, may lead to very erroneous if not dangerous conclusions, as it
appears to have done at Thessalonica; it is necessary to consider the
different senses in which this phrase is used, that we may know its
specific meaning in the different places where it occurs. Dr. Macknight,
in the fourth section of his preface, intitled, Different Comings of
Christ are spoken of in the New Testament, has treated this subject also
with considerable judgment, as the reader will at once perceive.

"In this article I propose to show that there are other comings of
Christ spoken of in Scripture besides his coming to judgement; and that
there are other things besides this mundane system whose end is there
foretold; and that it is of these other matters the apostles speak, when
they represent the day of their Master and the end of all things as at
hand.

"First, then, in the prophetic writings of the Jews ([Sa2
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#010.md), [Sa2
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#012.md); [Psa
97:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#002.md); [Isa
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#001).md) great exertions of the Divine
power, whether for the salvation or destruction of nations, are called
the coming, the appearance, the presence of God. Hence it was natural
for the apostles, who were Jews, to call any signal and evident
interposition of Christ, as Governor of the world, for the
accomplishment of his purposes, his coming and his day; accordingly,
those exertions of his power and providence, whereby he destroyed
Jerusalem and the temple, abrogated the Mosaic institutions, and
established the Gospel, are called by the apostles his coming, and day;
not only in allusion to the ancient prophetic language, but because
Christ himself, in his prophecy concerning these events, recorded [Mat
24:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#030.md) etc., has termed them the coming
of the Son of man, in allusion to the following prophecy of Daniel, of
which his own prophecy is an explication; [Dan
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013.md), [Dan
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#014.md) : 'I saw in the night visions,
and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and
came to the Ancient of days. And they brought him near before him. And
there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom; that all people,
nations, and languages, should serve him. His dominion is an everlasting
dominion, which shall not pass away; and his kingdom that which shall
not be destroyed.' This prophecy the Jewish doctors, with one consent,
attribute to the Messiah, and of that temporal kingdom which they
expected was to be given him. Farther, they supposed he would erect that
temporal kingdom by great and visible exertions of his power for the
destruction of his enemies; but they little suspected that themselves
were of the number of those enemies whom he was to destroy; and that his
kingdom was to be established upon the ruin of their state. Yet that was
the true meaning of the coming of the Son of man in the clouds of
heaven. For, while the Jewish nation continued in Judea, and observed
the institutions of Moses, they violently opposed the preaching of the
Gospel, by which the Messiah was to reign over all people, nations, and
languages. Wherefore, that the everlasting kingdom might be established
effectually, it was necessary that Jerusalem and the Jewish state should
be destroyed by the Roman armies. Now, since our Lord foretold this sad
catastrophe in the words of the prophet Daniel, [Mat
24:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#030.md), 'And they shall see the Son of
man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory;' and
after describing every particular of it with the greatest exactness,
seeing he told his disciples, [Mat
24:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#034.md), 'This generation shall not pass
till all these things be fulfilled;' can there be any doubt that the
apostles, (who, when they wrote their epistles, certainly understood the
true import of this prophecy), by their Master's coming and by the end
of all things, which they represent as at hand, mean his coming to
destroy Jerusalem, and to put an end to the institutions of Moses? It is
no objection to this, that, when the apostles heard Christ declare,
'There shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be
thrown down,' they connected the end of the world or age with that
event; [Mat 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#003.md) : 'Tell us, when
shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, και
συντελειας του αιωνος, and of the end of the age?' For as the Jewish
doctors divided the duration of the world into three ages; the age
before the law, the age under the law, and the age under the Messiah;
the apostle knew that the age under the law was to end when the age
under the Messiah began; and therefore by the end of the age they meant,
even at that time, not the end of the world, but the end of the age
under the law, in which the Jews had been greatly oppressed by the
heathens. And although they did not then understand the purpose for
which their Master was to come, nor the true nature of his kingdom; nor
suspect that he was to make any chance in the institutions of Moses; yet
when they wrote their epistles, being illuminated by the Holy Ghost,
they certainly knew that the institutions of Moses were to be abolished;
and that their Master's kingdom was not a temporal but a spiritual
dominion, in which all people, nations, and languages were to be
governed, not by external force, but by the operation of truth upon
their minds through the preaching of the Gospel.

"Farther, that the apostles, by the coming of Christ, which they
represented as at hand when they wrote their epistles, meant his coming
to establish his spiritual kingdom over all people, nations, and
languages, and not his coming to put an end to this mundane system, is
evident from what Christ himself told them, [Mat
16:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#028.md) : 'There be some standing here
who shall not taste of death till they see the Son of man coming in his
kingdom.' And, agreeably to this account of the coming of Christ and of
the end of all things, I observe that every passage of their epistles,
in which the apostles have spoken of these things as at hand, may with
the greatest propriety be interpreted of Christ's coming to establish
his everlasting kingdom over all people, nations, and languages, by
destroying Jerusalem, putting an end to the law of Moses, and spreading
the Gospel through the world. Thus, [Co1
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#011.md) : 'These things - are written
for our admonition, upon whom τα τελη των αιωνων, the ends of the ages
are come,' means the end of the age under the law, and the beginning of
the age under the Messiah. [Phi 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#005.md) :
'Let your moderation be known to all men: the Lord is nigh;' namely, to
destroy the Jews, your greatest adversaries. [Heb
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#026.md) : 'But now once επι συντελειᾳ των
αιωνων, at the conclusion of the ages, (the Jewish jubilees), hath he
been manifested to abolish sin-offering by the sacrifice of himself.'
[Heb 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#025.md) : 'Exhorting one another
daily; and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching,' the day of
Christ's coming to destroy Jerusalem and the Jewish state. [Heb
10:37](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#037.md) : 'For yet a little while, and
he who is coming will come, and will not tarry.' [Jam
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#007.md) : 'Wherefore, be patient,
brethren, unto the coming of the Lord.' [Jam
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#008.md) : 'Be ye also patient, strengthen
your hearts, for the coming of the Lord (to destroy the Jews, your
persecutors) draweth nigh.' [Jam 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#009.md) :
'Behold the Judge standeth before the door.' [Pe1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#007.md) : 'The end of all things (the end
of Jerusalem, and of the temple, and of all the Mosaic institutions)
hath approached. Be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.' [Jo1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#018.md) : 'Young children, it is the last
hour of the Jewish state; and as ye have heard (from Christ, in his
prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem) that antichrist cometh, so now
there are many antichrists, whence we know that it is the last hour of
the Jewish state.'

2\. "There is another coming of Christ spoken of by the apostles,
different likewise from his coming to judge the world, and to put an end
to the present state of things; viz. his coming to destroy the man of
sin. [Th2 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008.md) : 'Him the Lord will
consume by the breath of his mouth, and will render ineffectual by the
bright shining of his coming.' This singular event, which will
contribute greatly to the honor of God and the good of his Church, being
accomplished by a visible and extraordinary interposition of the power
of Christ in the government of the world, is, agreeably to the Scripture
style, fitly called the coming of the Lord, and the bright shining of
his coming; but this coming is nowhere in the Scriptures said to be at
hand.

3\. "There is likewise a day or coming of Christ, spoken of by Paul,
different from his coming to judgment, and from both the former comings;
I mean his releasing his people from their present trial by death. [Co1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#008.md) : 'He also will confirm you unto
the end, without accusation, in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.' [Phi
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006.md) : 'He who hath begun in you a good
work, will be completing it until the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.' It
is true, the release of Christ's servants from their present trial by
death is accomplished, for the most part, by no extraordinary display of
his power; yet it is fitly enough called his day and coming, because by
his appointment all men die, and by his power each is carried to his own
place after death. Besides, his servants in particular being put on
their duty, like soldiers, must remain at their several posts till
released by their commander: and when he releases them, he is fitly said
to come for that purpose.

4\. "Besides all these, there is a day or coming of the Lord to judge
the world, and to put an end to the present state of things. This coming
Christ himself has promised. [Mat
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#027.md) : 'The Son of man shall come in
the glory of his Father with his holy angels; and then shall he reward
every man according to his work.' Now this, being a real, personal
appearing of Christ in the body, is, more properly than any other of his
comings, called the day and coming of Christ. And the purposes of it
being more important than those of his other comings, the exertions of
his power for accomplishing them will be most signal and glorious. Hence
this coming is, with great propriety, termed the revelation of Jesus
Christ, and the day of his revelation, when he shall be glorified in his
saints, and admired of all them who believe.

"Thus it appears that, when the apostles wrote, there were four comings
of Christ to happen, three of them figurative, but the fourth a real
appearance; that these different comings are frequently spoken of in
Scripture; and that, although the coming of Christ to destroy Jerusalem,
and to establish his everlasting kingdom, be represented by the apostles
as then at hand, no passage from their writings can be produced in which
his personal appearance to judge the world is said, or even insinuated,
to be at hand. The truth is, if the different comings of Christ are
distinguished as they ought to be, we shall find that the apostles have
spoken of each of them according to truth; and that the opinion which
some Christians have unadvisedly espoused, to the great discredit of the
inspiration of the apostles, has not the least foundation in Scripture."
The epistle naturally divides itself into three parts, and each is
contained in a separate chapter.

Part 1. [Th2 1:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#001.md) - Contains the
address, and motives of consolation in their afflicted and persecuted
state.

Part 2. Chap. 2 - Is partly prophetical, and partly didactic. It
contains the doctrine concerning Christ's coming to judgment, and a
prophecy concerning some future but great apostasy from the Christian
faith.

Part 3. Chap. 3 - Is wholly hortatory; and contains a number of
important advices relative to Christian virtues, and a proper behavior
in those situations in life in which it had pleased God to call them.

This is the shortest of all St. Paul's epistles to the Churches, but is
of very great importance, and in many places very sublime, especially in
the second part; and in this there are several very great difficulties,
and some things hard to be understood. After all the pains and labor of
learned men, it would be hazardous to say, the meaning of every part is
now clearly made out. What increases the difficulty is, that the apostle
refers to some private communication with themselves, no part of which
is on record, and without which it would require St. Paul's inspiration
to be able to fix the sense and meaning of all we find here. May the
Father of lights give the reader a wise understanding in all things!
Amen.
